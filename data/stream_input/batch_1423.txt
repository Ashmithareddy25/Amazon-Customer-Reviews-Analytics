1586487981|5.0|After decades of effort, billions of dollars, thousands of aid workers and hundreds of antipoverty programs, 865 million people still barely survive on the equivalent of less than a dollar a day. But that can change, one small clinic, one incentive and one schoolroom at a time according to this eye-opening work - The Financial Times/Goldman Sachs' business book of the year for 2011. Authors and MIT economic researchers Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo report field-tested experiments showing that lifting the world's poor into a more comfortable, productive life is possible, mostly with relatively simple changes, not masses of money. They call for understanding the human behaviors and motivations that drive all people, rich and poor alike, and apply that understanding to solving the seemingly overwhelming, intractable problem of global poverty. getAbstract strongly recommends this highly accessible yet scientific account of how to make life better for millions of people, while enabling the poor to contribute to the world's economic and social progress.
0385523912|4.0|I like this book and there are really not too many reports on North Korea. It would be great if more pictures are included in the book.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Consisting of six stories, nested upon themselves like a Matryoshka doll, Mitchell's novel takes the reader on a semi-laborious journey from 1850's South Pacific to 1930s Belgium to 1970s Southern California to early 21st century England to two dystopian visions of the future (one in a totalitarian Korea and the next to a post-Fall humanity in Hawaii during the 23rd century). Each of the six stories proceeds chronologically forward, then we reach 23rd century Hawaii, and then backwards we go so that we begin and end take place in1850s South Pacific. Along the way, through the idea of rebirth, we follow the progress and regress of humanity. Mitchell offers a stark vision of humanity's future, with the caveat that this could be one possible future, but he also includes a vision of alternate visions through the ideas of some of the characters -  if only humanity focuses on some key ideas and actions.<br /><br />Without being preachy about it, Mitchell's story is not for those who want their books to be escapist. The book lends itself to those who want their books to be read on multiple levels. Reading it is not easy. Often I found myself putting it down and thinking about the ideas of the book or putting it down because I could take no more at the time. Sound bad? It's not. While the book does take a while to read through, it lingers in the mind long after putting it down. The dystopian visions especially are full of ideas about what a future could be given certain trends; A dystopian vision so stark, that it makes Orwell and Huxley's books look positively Utopian.<br /><br />Should you read this? Yes. The style of the book is sublime, written in different styles in each of the six stories. And more importantly is the content. The content is food for the soul. And what a meal this book makes.
1118273052|2.0|Despite the fantastic review of previous and current edition of this book, I am a little disappointed on it. Here are the problems:<br /><br />(1) Stories are too old. Most of the interviews are conducted in 80s or 90s. The stock market has changed a lot since then. It is not the fault of the author, but I found I just can not easily understand many of their old trading experiences in 70s or 80s.<br /><br />(2) Too many stories on futures trading in the beginning. Again it might be what this book is supposed for. However how many of the amateur traders like me are interested in trading corns or wheat?<br /><br />(3) Too many words on the personal history of the interviewee. Frankly speaking we are not really interested in those information.<br /><br />(4) The advice is too general. This is understandable because it is challenging to to grasp their secret in two hours interview.<br /><br />This should be a great book but maybe my bias comes from the fact that an ordinary stock traders like me is not the right audience for this book.
0321344758|5.0|Wow - This book was recommended to me and they actually lent me a copy to read. But once I started reading there were so many points that I wanted to highlight for future reference I bought the book.  If you just pay attention to the chapter aout your home page it will more than pay for the book.
B0064BWE8U|4.0|Sophie has done it again. I loved this light hearted fun book. I did not want to leave the characters and finish the book. Of course it is a bit predictable with the outcome but the fun is in the anticipation of how it is all going to pan out. I needed a fun book to read, as we all do sometimes and this book was the perfect solution !
B000GDH9AA|5.0|all terms & conditions met, received product in timely manner. quality of merchandise was exactly as presented, and plays as it should. no negative issues to report
B002MQYOFW|4.0|i purchased this kindle book because my daughter's hardcopy was loaned out and i needed to read it prior to the movie coming out. this is not a series that i would have read if not for the cultural phenomenon and my daughters both wanting to read the books and go to the movie.  the subject matter is a bit dark for me - being a parent puts it in a completely different light.  but, the books are well written.  the characters are well developed.  there is depth to the plot.  there is an underlying message and warning that can't be missed.  overall, the books are good even given the sadness of the subject matter.  and i totally get why they are so popular across all ages and with both girls and guys.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is the Bomb.Com! I've had absolutely no issues with it. Such a great way to pass time when you are bored. I highly recommend it you won't regret this download I can promise you that! :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can understand why this book has been made into a movie. It is well written and easy to read. I love the characters and it gives me something to think about. I look forward to reading the remaining two books. Great trilogy!
0800179501|5.0|This movie is an oldie but a goodie.  My kids wanted to see it after viewing the modern remake, and they didn't find the movie as dated as others we show them from \\"back in the day\\".  It is a great movie for family viewing, and a real bargain.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Fun game. You build the community of animals/play games/watch movies while collecting money from the animals to buy more things. Fun.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|My son is really enjoying this game. I like it because he is learning as he plays. much better than your average video game.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is awesome I love it if you like playing Mario you'll like leps world there are different levels two enemies pots of gold and a lot more
078322804X|5.0|Not only is this one of the best movies but it was also cheap.  I highly enjoyed it and I think everyone should own it!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|A little sad at the beginning but was a wonderful story and the ending was spectacular!  Fortunately,I remember these races and that beautiful horse!
B005TPCQ5I|1.0|This was one of those movies where the best part of the movie was the trailer!  We got 25 minutes into it, and just turned it off.  No plot.  All sexual jokes. (I have no problem with that--just make it part of the story!)  No character development.  No action.  In one scene, he had to hurry to catch the plane to India and in the next scene he was in Paris. Just sloppy.<br /><br />I wish I could get my money back...and my time.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I've only played for a few days, but I have enjoyed it. As others have said the energy time is a bit of an issue but not terrible.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|A must have app for all android gamers. Very addicting but tons of fun. Angry bird fever! A lot easier without  ads.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|we all play this game me and my friends cant wait to unlock all the games! Get this game its worth your time!
0792164903|5.0|I LOVE this movie so much that I bought two without realizing it.  Since it was so cheap I ended up not returning it and just gave it away.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Everyone is unhappy because of the fact you can buy some special items, but you don't have to. This is a fun and easy game to play. If you like Cafeworld or Farmville, you'll like the &quot;stories&quot;.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Simple enough to pick up easily, but enough of a challenge to keep it fun and fresh.  I appreciate knowing the best score in advance so I know what I'm aiming for.
B0067R0APK|4.0|You will use this app everyday and it is pleasant to interact with. I have seen other versions and know this one can still expand its functionality but it is the best out there.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|My hubby has Bern playing this game on his Ipad for a couple months now so I was happy to see it finally was available for my Kindle. Unfortunately it is very buggy right now. There are times I'll quit and come back hours later to find the game never progressed. It was like time had frozen - nothing replenished or showed that any time had passed. There was also a bug that caused all my times to increase significantly. My animals that should replenish in 15 minutes now have 120 hours remaining. They are useless now. My husband did have his whole town disappear after playing for a couple weeks. He had to start from scratch. I don't mind the energy replenish because it's enough to play for 10 minutes and then come back in a couple hours. If you're looking for something to waste hours away each day this is not the game.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Its great except for the fact that your energy runs out very fast. If you want to refill it you would have to use real money. I think this game is great other than the waiting for the energy.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I think that it is a fun time passer. I think everyone will be glad with his or her purchase
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I have not enjoyed a story line as much since the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  The only downside is that it is so addictive that it is maddening to wait for the next season to be released on Blu-Ray. I WANT MORE NOW!  The acting, story, effects, costumes, and the sets are incredibly realistic, giving one the feeling of actually being there and witnessing a true historical depiction, forcing one to constantly remind themselves that this is a fantasy, and never really happened, but for me personally the biggest pay off is 'there be dragons\\", which were just born at the end of this season, but look amazingly life like.  Aside from the incredibly detailed action, & sex scenes, Shakespeare would be envious of the range of human emotion portrayed showing the best & the worst of what is to be human from honor, nobility, courage, humor, love, loyalty, & devotion, to deceit, treachery, dishonor, betrayal, cowardice, selfishness, insanity, greed, avarice, lust, fear, & duplicity.  This series truly has something for everyone, pulling you into the lives of the characters so that you are emotionally invested in whether they succeed or fail. I pray the network executives have the good sense to continue this show for many years, preferably with more episodes per season, and less time between those seasons.  Even though this is a fantasy, the issues, between governments & people can be seen as a metaphor for our own existence.  I cannot imagine anyone not loving this show, and if they did, they are not someone I would care to know.
B005NS5CX4|5.0|I purchased Own The Night, when Amazon offered it for .25. Not only was it a fantastic deal, but I have enjoyed every song on the album.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is fun AND innovative. And it looked crisp and colorful on my Kindle Fire. Can't believe it was FREE! The Mario comparisons are appropriate (who doesn't love Mario?). Lep's world also has speed run levels and varied enemies. I just beat it this morning, after a week or two of playing it. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I will definitely be playing it again.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really like this game it is really fun when you are bored.Ps. hit setting then options and the bottom thing will turn on so you can. hit is and exit for people who is having trouble with that.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|it gets so boring and the game is to much money ill never spend money on this game ever if you are smart or dumb you will not like this did I mention I hats this game
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun. I enjoy it very much. hob. goal. tire. reed herd grub geese hood Fred wed fed awesome nub gigs long udder
0385528752|5.0|Very intuitive approach on how to produce a change. As it explains it doesn't need to be hard, but it has to be produced at the right level, or at all of them (mind, emotions, practice). Examples illustrations are very helpful, and very sticky analogy makes remembering the principles easy.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|everyone is saying that it takes forever to get energy but it only takes three minutes. I think that its a really fun game.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I had to download this book and start it as soon as I got to the end of book one. The first few chapters are my favorite of series. I loved seeing their relationship develop. It also introduced me to the Coldplay song \\"The Scientist\\" which I now love. Whenever it comes up on my iPod, it reminds me of Fifty Shades. Sure there is some repetition and there are minor things that annoy me, but the good far outweighs the bad for me. I loooove me some Fifty!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game you would like it to if u like super Mario get this game becuz it rocks:)GET It U Will LUV It.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Enjoyed reading this book, even more because I could relate to some aspects of the professional lives of Finley & Figg (and other ambulance chasers); I had a few friends in the legal profession  and they were definitely ambulance chasers. My experience is that some of the most hawkish attorneys are personal injury attorneys.<br /><br />Mr. Grisham did a wonderful job with the personality of the characters and their life stories. However, not too sure I was thrilled about the emphasis placed on the Kryaaox trial. I feel more should have been said about the lead poisoning cases.  Nevertheless, it was a great book.
B004LWZW8I|5.0|I rented this movie and was so impressed, I decided to purchase it. I am going to have a dinner and a movie, and invite my family and friends over to watch it. This movie is very realistic, and it is telling us about the times to come. It also relates with Revelation.
B0050G3NWG|5.0|Number 1 in AFI. I thinks you must have this edition. Transfer picture good 4/5 .. audio DTS HD Mono average 3/5 .. feature a lot ton of it 5/5 and bonus collectible 5/5. release with 3 disc .. 1 bluray .. 2 dvd. thanks to amazon i buy the lowest
B006OCM0G0|5.0|farm and club are also fun. addicting and goal oriented. friendly and needs no money. yes it might ask but you don't have to.
B0000C88L7|5.0|This seller deserves the top rating for service. She went above and beyond what I would have expected. The product will not play in the U.S. DVD players, but I was buying it to take to Spain where it would play. The Seller e-mailed me before shipping the DVD to be sure I was aware it was for Region 2. That's service!!!
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is amazing. You can get any song for free! Just search for the music video on the app. Download the file as a mp3, or audio, and it will download and save the song in your music file. It is amazing. I downloaded so many songs on this along with other videos that I loved on youtube. You can view the videos at anytime without having an internet connection.
0345803485|1.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of a bookstore clerk-methinks he recommended it because it was selling fast..NOT because it is a good book. It had some interesting erotica-but after 50 pages or so, it all just ran together. I also kind of hate the \\"damsel in distress who walks headlong into obvious heartbreak and trouble.\\"Wait for the movie..
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This cover is doing a good job so far.  I have had no problems with it and do not have any complaints.  The price was fairly reasonable too.
B000H30B3G|5.0|it's to late i buy this edition. but i am glad buy not to much. i like the figure. perhaps you will wait bluray edition later.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love bag it it's so fun were you get to put the thing's in the bag. u love were you cannot barack stoff
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|AND Now I love this as an Adult!!! I am so happy to have this game on my Fire!! I am totally ADDICTED!!! THANK YOU &quot;FREE APP&quot; OF THE DAY---WELL WORTH THE DOWNLOAD!!
B001HN694K|4.0|The visual aspects of this movie capture the eye.  The quirky characters capture the imagination.<br /><br />My only complaint was the lack of energy from the lead character Alice.  Even at the climax of the movie, she barely raises her voice as if she was a little bored with her own actions.  Despight that, I was still entertained from beginning to end.
1451648537|5.0|The Ipad, Iphone and Ipod changed my life so much to bring instant joy to moments that otherwise would be time wasted (in the car, at appointments, etc).  I also loved the Apple products from the late 80's and early 90's.  So, a biography of the leader behind this was something I couldn't wait to get my hands on ... and this didn't disappoint.<br /><br />The dichotomy and contradiction represented in Steve's character as portrayed in this book was at times difficult to process.  However, the writing was seamless, fluid and characteristic of the storytelling we saw glimpses of from Steve.  I don't usually read biographies, but this was as mesmerizing to read as the man behind the story.  I finished the book wanting more glimpses into the life of this extraordinary man ...
B004SYP5WC|5.0|Awesome app! No more marking the calendar with bill due dates!! Set reminders to whenever it's convenient for you. Thank You!!
B004SIP6A4|5.0|Chicago winning the oscar must have this edition if the price low. With transfer picture 4/5 and audio LPCM 5/5 and supplement from dvd edition 4/5. i buy dont have slipcase. i hope no release again with anniversay edition because the feature or supplement not new ( from dvd version )
B005HSL626|5.0|the ones who thinks the game bad you are wrong this game is awesome I love it lots is so cool
B007PTJOV0|5.0|peps world is an awesome game to play if you get the chance play this game it plays like Mario bro's it plays. well no glitches or hickups.  or other stuff.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I... I... can't ... stop!  my hand hurts from playing so much.  no more review. I have to play more.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Fun! This is like Mario Bros. Lots of good memories coming back to me. I like the little leprechaun, too. So cute!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love having the word with me wherever I am.  I have completed several reading plans and truly enjoy spending this time with the almighty.
B007R41E8O|1.0|Just a horrible ending...  Not too much on the seek games as it's mostly Myst like.  Expect a lot of useless going back and forth used to extend the game time.  Let me just say once again ...horrible ending.  They give the option to review before you realize how repetitive it is which is leading to a higher review than it deserves.  You don't ever figure out what is going on...so be prepared for that.  Maybe just don't read the story...
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its a really fun game not like the original but you do get to built your own town and visit other towns. you can also send request to yoir friends to join you and to send you stuff.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I'm addicted its epic exactly like care world never ever will I stop playing this game pure epicness keep it up every body should get this game
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I really like it... I don't give it a five star cause it needs you to have neighbors... I enjoy playing the game but I don't wanna bother ppl with it its so annoying... That being said add me MaesHughes121 :)
B007J4T2G8|3.0|James is not a particularly good writer but seems quite knowledgeable about the intricacies of S and M. Although the sex is rough it is still quite titillating to read about. If you think you're buying a romance novel you'll be disappointed, but it does leave you wanting more.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|fun and exciting story, if a tad depressing. looking forward to seeing the movie based on the imagery created in the book. it was easy to enter the world of Panem by reading the visual detail laid out for us.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|1 energy = $1.00....complete rip off.  How does this have so many stars?  Idea is good bit plan to leave game on for a long time to build energy or pay $1 per action.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|I'm listening to Alabama Shakes debut album Boys & Girls and I can only think one thing: Damn. If you have a voice like Brittney Howard's, there is only one thing the creator of the universe had in store for you, and that is sing, baby. Sing.<br /><br />`I Found You' is one of those songs that ends up on a million mix tapes. It's sweet, soulful and melancholy sound will make a thousand lovelorn souls sigh and lay their heads on the universe's shoulder. This isn't a bunch of Dartmouth dropouts putting on an Al Green record and suddenly thinking they're modern purveyors of white boy soul. No. Alabama Shakes is the real deal, and they've got the golden pipes to prove it. `Hang Loose' will make even the whitest boys and girls want to shake what they got. `Rise To The Sun', with it's hammond organ, rasta rhythm and chorus that explodes in your ears like Pop Rocks makes you want to stand up and shout at the top of your lungs \\" I hurt!  I need love, too!\\". A song like `You Ain't Alone' in the hands of any of these other modern day wanna be soul queens would just sound, well, like American Idol Karaoke night at the local sports bar. But in the hands of Brittney Howard and the fellas in Alabama Shakes it sounds like a lost track from Janis Joplin's Pearl sessions. This girl has got the chops. Tina Turner? Aretha Franklin? Mavis Staples? Janis Joplin? Yeah, she's right up there with the best of `em.<br /><br />Production-wise, it's got a nice grit to it. It's not all spit-shined and prettied up for the masses. This is not retail store box dinner soul music. Sorry Adele, Duffy and whoever else bought Dusty In Memphis and decided to be a singer, you need to go to the back of the line. Alabama Shakes got it covered. Try imagining any of the above mentioned busting out a track like `Heartbreaker' with the same amount of heart and teary-eyed sincerity. There isn't a plug-in that can create that sort of truth in the voice. And the title track? Southern soul hasn't been put to tape like that since Muscle Shoals heyday. When Brittney Howard sings \\"Be mine, baby\\", by God you're gonna seriously consider it.<br /><br />Alabama Shakes brings the soul, the funk and the groove that will keep you coming back for years to come. The menu titled Boys & Girls is a southern-fried concoction of flavors you've tasted in the past, but with some new spices added. Come hungry, and come back often.like that since Muscle Shoals heyday. When Brittney Howard sings \\"Be mine, baby\\", by God you're gonna seriously consider it.<br /><br />Alabama Shakes brings the soul, the funk and the groove that will keep you coming back for years to come.

B0050XFY4O|5.0|The movie started out slow, but soon it had pulled me in. Its been so long since ive seen a great movie like this and actually cried at the end lol, but yeah I loved it.
B002ZG97LK|1.0|wARNING!!! This movie will be the biggest waste of your most precious resource (TIME). This movie is so bad, that its hard to know where to begin. My girlfriend was watching it around the same time I sit down to eat lunch. This is another typical HOLLYWooD movie thats full of stereotypes. The movie was made by people that have no business making movies about things they know little to nothing about ala Breakin'. The only business they have making this movie is... Bu$ine$$. Where is the ACLU/ ADL when you need them? This movie manages to stereotype everybody correctly as well as incorrectly. The leading character is a cheap Matt Damon knockoff with a  Southie accent. The movie manages to beg, borrow, and steal from every pop movie done in the 80s, including The Karate Kid. Trust me, you're better off staring at the TV turned off than this poor excuse for entertainment. This is Darwins Nightmare...survival of the misfittest...This is what you get when a small privileged class of clowns control all forms of media. BURN HOLLYWOOD BURN!!!  BOOYAAA!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Interesting and thought provoking; this book is unusual, well written and absorbing. It deserves the 5 stars - my teenage daughter is also reading and enjoying it now.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|Serenity's crew as outlaws, and as family, would have been difficult to write any better.  Risque, controversial, aggressively humanistic, imaginative and delightfully humorous. And if you are seeking action, it is more or less continuous.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game so much that sometimes I have to bring my kindle fire everywhere even at the pool that is how much I love it
0307454568|4.0|I really enjoyed all three books and the final chapter did not disappoint.  I would recommend all three books to anyone.
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|Great game to play to pass time while at the DMV. Weapon variety is nice and it's fun to figure out which weapons to take into the boss fights to exploit weaknesses. My big issues are with repetitiveness, and the often annoying dialogue. The main character and villain argue and fuss like school girls. I think some of the jokes are intentionally bad and add character. Some English language errors. Other than that, great casual game.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Wow. That's all I can say. Whoever writes this is a genius. The actors are so good, when I watch, I am completely stressed out. I feel like I'm there and the events are happening to me. Who thought there could be new angles to shoot from that would have such an impact on drawing you into the story. One warning: The violence is graphic. I mean REALLY graphic. I cover my eyes and ask my husband \\"What's happening?!? WHAT'S HAPPENING?!?!?\\" Drives him crazy. Not every episode is violent I don't believe because the violence is not for violence's sake. It's because everything in the story is so REAL--TOO real--which is what makes it great. My husband and I are not the types to get addicted to a show, but Breaking Bad is more of an experience.  LOVE IT!!!! By the way, I'm not commenting on the story itself because if you're like me (don't buy cable and are being exposed to this for the first time) I DO NOT want to ruin this for you. If you've seen it already, then you know what I mean.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Fun game to play.  It is easy to learn and there are enough new things that come upnto keep it interesting.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Losing energy is the only bad thing about this game. fun and addicting.it is a great time waster and good while at work.
B0063IH60K|5.0|works great on the fire a great way to waste time when you dont want to start in to a book
0439023513|5.0|This trilogy conveys the truth of the dark side of human nature by immersing you into the horrible consequences of it. The author remains true to the horror of it. And since it is true, there is great value in reading it. This is an important work.
B006MGC3VK|2.0|I've listened to it and I find that this doesn't appeal to me these days. A lot of it sounds too minimalistic for me<br />even though I did enjoy some of earlier albums and even chroma key releases. It could be that in this day and time<br />I've heard too many Garageband sampled (software) indie produced goodies that do similar music but, much better than this<br />low effort KM material(and much quicker). On this release KM seems bored, Matheos seems bored so do some of their<br />listeners. Even with the Chroma Key material when KM starts talking about organic sounds it is sure to sound<br />like a bunch of preprocessed Garageband samples jumbled together. Being weird for weird's sake and having no<br />general direction or inspiration for songs just isn't cutting it these days. Glitch Music indeed.
157421327X|1.0|Worst book with regard to value for the money I've ever purchased.  First, Amazon has it at list price (not discounted) of $8.99.  It is so very basic you'd have to never have doodled in your life to find it very useful.  Sorry, I'm a book lover of all types but this one leaves me cold.  Short on writing.  For example under \\"Sources of Inspiration\\" it lists five items.  It's more like the equivalent of a handout you'd get if you took a class.  It's 18 pages with big print and lots of pictures.  I doubt I'd purchase an of her other books and there are other Zentangle authors out there.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|it is a total rip off of Mario but it is ok and it is a game I can play with out getting mad!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Love the music great for a nice cool down at the end of the day to help get you reel relaxed and ready for bed .
B003BWERF8|1.0|Never worked on my 2 old classic 64GB ipods.<br />And the charge never stayed charged<br />I cant reroute the ipod output to the bluetooth connector
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Honest opinion, its a good time waster. Gives me something to do when I'm bored. I did have to reload the game once. I was moving several houses and dropped one on a running rabbit and was unable to collect from either of them but it was just a glitch. still a good game.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I LOVE this game!!!!!!!!!!!!' it is AMAZING!!! you have to get it!!! its my favorite app!! if u don't have it goooooooooooooo get it NOW!!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|plays well&hellip;I would prefer it with no ads. but then it would not be free.<br />Well worth the lack of price.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I like this app more than I expected to..I have replied, sent and opened emails without any problems. I have even opened attachments.I also have been able to scroll through all my pages of emails.It will alert you went you get an email, although I have turned it off.its nothing fancy, but its worth the free download!
1466401885|1.0|I got this book because it had so many positive reviews. I just don't get it, I thought this was an absolutely awful romance. It was impossible for me to like either of the main charcters. The situations they were thrown into seemed so contrived to me. For instance all the stuff that happened in the cafeteria sounded much more like high school than college to me. It seemed like everybody had lunch at the same time and they all went to the cafeteria. This does not happen at college in real life. The emotional maturity shown by the two main characters was nonexistant. I thought Travis was somebody I would stay far, far away from. The drinking was also out of control and made them seem like they were pretty trashy in my opinion. Also the dialogue between  Abby and Travis was so ridiculously over the top that it was laughable at times. I probably should have stopped reading about halfway through, but I kept thinking that maybe it would get better. Bad news, it doesn't.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|this game is solid. great gameplay and graphics. plus it's more than just Mahjong. I love the storyline &amp; alternate game modes.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I'm actually enjoying the game, but serpent is kind of tricky.  I got so close then my dad distracted me and I ran rout into the wall.  Ugh.
0307269752|1.0|I didn't read the book yet as my beau brought the movie over to my house and it was the first I heard of it.  Of the reviews on the net, it sounds like a very good read.  However, I pulled the dvd out after about half hour.  It shows forced sodomy, kidnap and rape in a very real and raw form.  I didn't know what the movie was about.  I had an idea it was about vindication...I happen to like martial arts but never did I think I was going to encounter what I saw and the way I saw it.  It's not snapshots and the scene doesn't run thru quickly.  If you're someone who has suffered this trauma, I strongly put an advisory on this.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Fun game but being able to connect with friends is important. many of the mini missions are easier to complete with the help of friends. everytime I try to visit or request anything from friends it say unable to connect to server. not everyone wants to buy their way through the game, at least not all the time.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|really fun game. My only complaint is once u use up your cash there is no way to replenish without spending real money. so for the fishing task if u miss one fish u have to buy cash to get worms. guess that is one task I will never finish
B003EY7IRC|4.0|Stayed up to 3 a.m. finishing this book!! I am ambilvilant right now. I am happy the series is over and Mackayla got her absolution. I can honestly say that this is one of the most original paranormal romance that I have read. And I have read a lot. The best part of the story is that everything isn't black and white. You dont't know who to root for and everyone apparently has a dark side. If you are looking for a original story to get lost in this book and series is the one you want.. Why did I deduct a star you ask?<br /><br />********Spoiler Alert***********<br /><br /> I will try not to give too much away. But i deducted a star due to the fact that I hated Barrons as a romantic hero! Everything he did to Mackayla!! The violence, lies, mystery, throwing the cake she made, practically mind raping her, then definetly physically raping her. I am so sure he couldnt figure out another way to bring her back. He was awful and i hated any scenes with them together. I would have preferred she end up alone. Then never finding out what he is. Ugh, When I invest money in 5 books,i expect all questions to be answered.. And what about Dani? I guess we are suppose to forget about her and what happens to her after finding out her big secret...<br /><br />I don't know. I feel like there were so many questions, mysteries, betrayals, that there should have been a better wrap up! But overall, I was intrigued to the end. So buy the book but be prepared to be left wondering!!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I enjoy this game.  I don.'t mind the wait on energy..if you play other games like this on zynga you actually have to wait longer for energy to refill.  My big gripe is the time glitches.  I opened the game up this morning only to find the time is messed up yet again.  I have over 70 before I can collect from a house. going to make the challenge where you have to collect from the geese even harder
030771652X|1.0|This novel was a disappointment in that there was so much repetitive writing in telling about the sisters' relationships many times.  I can't recommend the book as it isn't much of a mystery.  Perhaps the author's next book will be more closely edited.  Anna M. Seidler
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|the game is fun and good for children. I think that the game is good for all ages. most people will like the game. it includes fishing and hunting.

0307346617|3.0|I'm 135 pages into this post (yet still currently) appoctoborelic exercise in sadistic journalisim because it tops all the best zombie novel lists.  World War Zzzzzzzzz, surviving the snoozefest.  I've really tried to like this novel, but by page 99 it became a chore to crack it open, and right now I just feel sick to my stomach at the thought of struggling through another page.  I hate to not read something I buy, but this one is going to have to be trudged through a bit at a time between more enjoyable books.  I hate to give such a bad review because it is obvious that Mr Brooks really did a lot of research on this story.<br /><br />I wonder if it doesn't make it to the top of all the lists out of spite.  I suffered through it, so I'm going to trick you into suffering through it too.<br /><br />I'm going to go step up the entertainment level now and read \\"The Baking Powder Controversy part 2.\\"<br /><br />Ok, I just finished the book and I'm upgrading my review from 1 star to 3 stars.  There was just a very tough boring spot to get through.  ARound page 145 or so the book picked back up.  There were some very good short stories in the book.  Unfortunatley there were quite a few that failed to capture my interest.<br /><br />Many of the stories seemed like repetitive in nature and tone.  Some of them read like a history book, and I suffered the same fate as when I try to read a history book...my eyes read the words but my brain goes to sleep for a few pages.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the story about the downed pilot and about the verius battles.  There were some creative ideas.  I loved the creation of the lobo.  I thought the whole idea of people acting like zombies throwing off research was a brilliant touch.<br /><br />Even though this novel was very painfull in spots, I think it serves as a great research tool for anyone wanting to write about zombies.  It brings the whole culture and slang up a level from Ramero.
B004SF30HI|5.0|I really found this soundtrack great, had all the main songs from the movies plus the extended and full versions. It has a wonderful tropical vibe and honestly made the movie itself all that much better, I bought this soundtrack first than the movie.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I really wanted this to work but it locked up my fire and I had to power off and back on.  Please fix this.  I want all games to work but games that are Kindle Fire editions should be tested and work.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Highly recommend.  Highly addictive.  Lots of fun.  Great way to pass the time.  Great graphics.  Very cute.  More levels please!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Well crafted and polished game with a hint system that makes it possible to bypass those puzzles that become the most frustrating to complete, or even just to show the optimal solution.
1468161660|5.0|Slammed is such a perfect title. For the poetry but also for how your emotions get slammed reading this book. The hits kept on coming and this might hold up to be my favorite read of 2012.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I watched it last night with friends and loved it. Very suspenseful.as for the DVD , LOL. Perfect presentation...I for one cannot understand how some people cannot open their eyes and understand its in reference to the main character being a hacker..I mean really ..

B0054VVRBQ|4.0|Great addition for my MacBook Pro.  Fits flush in the Express Slot.  The reader works great after locating and installing the driver.  However, it took a bit of time to find the Trenscend website to obtain the appropriate driver.  The other caveat is pressing the card in the express slot was a little difficult as other reviewers have indicated.

0345803485|5.0|I bought this book 21 hours ago and I'm almost finished. It's equal parts frustrating and enrapturing - I can't put it down. As someone who studies editing and publishing, I definitely see where the criticism of the book is coming from. But hey, we're all entitled to a bit of a light, guilty read. That's what it is. I'll be saving the next two instalments for my 24 hour plane trips in a couple of months time. It'll definitely make them a lot more 'interesting'.
B0057VDGNK|5.0|the most beatiful OST in years!<br />Cliff Martinez best work! Is the perfect music for this great movie!<br />MUST OST!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good program just hate that you can never earn any cash. maybe next update will hVe this. other than that lovr it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|surprisingly, the game is great. works perfectly on the HTC EVO. keep 'em coming, fallen tree games! look forward to much more.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it a great game, I use 2 love the original game and this is just as much fun. it fun 2 c my kids playing n enjoying it.
B000V5ZIBU|4.0|i haven't watched ds9 before because others said that after watching Voyager, this would be bad.  but i actually like it.  the first 2 or 3 seasons aren't that good, but once the Dominion war gets started, it gets a lot better.  i think that it is cool how they build the whole Sisko character from the Wolf 359 attack in TNG with Locutis of Borg.  this episode is probably the best out of the first 2-3 seasons, but in my opinion season 5, 6, 7 are the best.  but before you judge this series on what other people say, try it yourself, if you're like me, you'll like it a lot (even though its Still not quite as good a Voyager)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a must have! get it while its free! gotta get used to the controls but that was easy!
B002M2T1UO|1.0|I just purchased the Shield Complete box set, the 3rd disc for season one was missing. In its place was an additional disc one for season 1.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am going to start off by saying...I THINK E.L. JAMES IS A MAN!!! I picked this up, like a lot of people, to see what all the fuss was about. At first, I will admit, it was sexy. The whole teacher/student, Madonna/whore, dominant/submissive thing... it's not news that those core themes have been turning both men and women on for millennia. But the execution of this felt a little... off. From the repetitive 7th grade vocab words, to the outlandish (and I feel, boring) sex scenes, to the fact that whoever wrote this book is so blatantly NOT in touch with what turns intelligent women on, I was left, shall we say... unsatisfied.<br />First of all, I couldn't get past the vocabulary. It felt like the author picked up a thesaurus aimed at middle school kids and used the same words over... and over... and over... It made the characters seem, quite frankly, stupid. At no point did I believe this was a college educated young lady, or a billionaire, business savant. Neither category talks like that.<br />The other main point of contention I had was the sex. And let's just be real with this one, NO ONE has sex like that. ....To be honest, I was bored. I felt like it was the same moves over and over again. It kind of went \\"turn page, turn page, turn page... Ok- now the sex... Let's see first he'll scold about biting the lip, yep- there it is... Now he will grab her chin and angle her face to him, right on cue... Now let's grab the hair, of course...\\" I won't write all the details here, in an effort to keep the review PG-13 but come on!! I actually flipped right past the last sex scene (climax?) of the book, because I just didn't care to read it.<br />The sexual words threw me as well. What 21 year old girl (who has never been kissed, touched herself... and I vaguely remember, never held hands with a boy) knows anything about her clitoris?!? And anyone who knows what a clitoris is... would not call their lady parts, their \\"sex.\\" What is that?!? I'm not sure I really know.<br />My main problem with this book, and the reason I was prompted to write this review, is that I just think it is so incredibly clear that the author is a man. (I'm going to say \\"HE\\" from now on.) He so obviously has no idea as to what women are made of, how they work, or what turns them on. Should we start with the gorgeous 21 year old, who hasn't even been kissed? (I'm sorry- I went to college, those girls... are lying.) It's kind of like the \\"Barely 18\\" thing. Sorry guys... the girls in those movies are really 23, and probably have herpes. Hot, young, untouched- yet ready for full blown S & M girls only exist in one place... porn; which is created by, and for, men.<br />Now, should I even start with the (pardon the pun) come on cue orgasms?! Women don't actually work that way- and (full disclosure) I have sex, good sex, with my husband who is sex-on-a-stick hot, and is really, really good at it. It doesn't work that way- regardless of how turned on you are. The whole thing, to me, just seemed like it was a man, writing what he thinks turns women on. This so grossly misses the mark, it's almost laughable. No wait... it actually IS laughable. If it turns out that the author is in fact a woman; which I doubt. She has never engaged in any sexual activity, either on her own or with a partner.<br />Please tell me there is something out there that is sexy AND aimed at intelligent women?!? Don't send me out on an iceberg with an old copy of the Twilight series and tell me to dumb down to be turned on. I can't do it... And will the literary world PLEASE wake up and realize women are YEARNING for something to arouse, and excite us- there is a big market for it... Which means big $$$ for you. Please take some of that to hire authors who are worth it. For the $9.99 I spent on this, I could have gotten an old issue of \\"fill in the blank\\" porn mag, a Britney single of \\"Oh Baby Baby\\" (schoolgirl skirt and all) and a bag of cotton candy. Fluff, and diluted porn- not my cup of tea... Twining's or otherwise.
B007R41E8O|2.0|Took forever to download, then when I finally could play it, big white patches would come up on the screen! I'm happy with the other Alawar game I have, but when you pay for something, you expect it to work. Installed to Acer tablet.
B007Q2N0HA|4.0|Okay, now really, I am not being \\"cheeky\\" in the least.  \\"Bared to You\\" is so similar to \\"Fifty Shades\\" until I was reading it thinking \\"Can she do this\\"? I have not read twilight, however, from what I have read about the series, everybody's cashing in...God Bless America<br /><br />It was the way a seasoned writer would have written the \\"50\\" Trilogy.  It was very good and actually, I liked it better than the E.L. James novels.<br /><br />Not to put the EL trilogy down, I mean, Ms. James scored big time, I am in awe of her success - however, Ms. Day can actually write - she has many novels and awards to prove it.<br /><br />Did not like the cover so much - even though it was sexy, it was not classy enough.  It was kind of a \\"high powered\\" novel; the cover made it seem a little bit cheap.  Can't help but compare it to the 50 trilogy...sorry.<br /><br />Congratualtion to Ms. Day.  It's as if you were saying \\"This is how you do it...\\"  Thanks.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|take a look at the permissions.  there are around 15 and they are extremely invasive. for example, the developer has access to your camera! meaning it can view whatever your camera can see. creepy weather channel lose the unnecessary permissions
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very simple and easy-to-understand controls as well as lenghty list of customizable options. User friendly and quite a quick learning curve. This game is a must buy!
0394800389|5.0|This again is a great seuss classic! The rhyming is great and is helpful to beginner readers. If they can rhyme, that is a good start  for reading. My two year old grandson loves this book and the pictures.

B0059XTUXQ|4.0|I assumed this would be the story of the political career of England's first woman prime minister.  It did tell that story indirectly through flashbacks, but the main focus is Margaret Thatcher in old age, suffering from senile dementia.  That is also a powerful and moving story.  Meryl Streep's performance is amazing.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|it is a good game I just hats the asking to buy tokens it makes the game kinds dissapointing buy overall ilike it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book at the request of a friend and was a little skeptical at first becuase of her discription of the book; however, it ended up being worth while and I really enjoyed it. It is a mixture of suspense, violent action and love; I do wish there would have been a little more of the action than the other two but it still makes out to be a great story and I am now reading the second book. Also if you have seen the movie or heard things about the movie don't let it discourage you from reading the book... like always the book is better.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is great but is something like another game . I don't remember tha name  but other than that i love it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game... play it all the time... need more games like it.....great game....play it all the time.....play it all the time
0439023521|5.0|The reviews for this book are so numerous that I am sure that mine will simply be just lost in the crowd. So let me just say that this was a surprisingly good book and that while it was written on the young adult level, this could have just as effectively been written on an adult level.  While the outcome of the book and the resolution of the problems that the main character Katniss faces seem simple on the surface there is an underlying tension that runs throughout the entire book that simply does not let up even on the last page.  The author has achieved something that so many other writers fail at and that is creating a story that seems to pull you along and even on some level make you a participant (is the reader really any different than one of the watchers of the Hunger Games?)  This is an excellent book that takes the survivalist and death-as-entertainment theme to another level.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|adele's music is fantastic, can listen to her all day and night long, great voice,<br />easy to mellow out to and just stare off into space
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Pros)I purchased this item not long after I got the kindle fire and it works great. It has a nice rubber outside with an elastic strap to hold down the front cover. The inside its felt, which is good because it won't scratch. The stand works well and I use it all the time.<br /><br />However the<br /><br />cons.) I wish there were more indents so I could adjust the angle of the stand, and I don't how it would hold against a.)water, or b.) a bad fall.<br /><br />Overall this a good product and worth the price.
B004WGGQPQ|2.0|it should be free for a limited time so people can get it even if they don't have money. if its sooo great lets us see
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really like this game. If you like the facebook games I think you'd really like this one.  Only thing is I wish you could play as long as u want without the energy running out.  Does take a lot of space on hour kindle.
0060873027|4.0|As usual I am impressed with the amount of research that goes into the making of a fictionalized novel. The factual descriptions of the insect life alone is worth the read , and having them interact with tiny humans is bonus. Thsi should be made into a movie,and if it is,it would compare with H.G Wells finest,which is who Michael Crichton reminds me of.
B004SUWR2C|2.0|I have played Uno on several devices and the app worked fine and was great. On the Kindle Fire, however, the app does not seem to be formatted correctly, and is zoomed on the bottom half of the screen. If you are thinking of buying this, then I suggest you wait until after Gameloft has fixed the glitch.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I have tried all the weather apps out there and this is by far the best in terms of features and stability.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Another good read by Nicholas Sparks! His books are amazing! All his books are so hard to put down! I loved this book!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|The game is fun but to get started well you really need to buy things for cash which I do not like. A storage buildings for food, gold axe and buildings are some to name a few.. It has crashed my fire once.
B007JF87VS|5.0|DH and I decided to go cable free....  (aka frugal).  BUT we found 2 shows we couldn't live without.  Both are available on Amazon for 1.99 per episode.  I've not tried the by the season option yet, as we went cable free mid season.  The shows are ready in an instant, and easy to play.  I just find myself wishing for an amazon player app for my kindle fire and my laptop desktop needs a simple link.<br /><br />the 1.99/episode for 2 different shows is still MUCH cheaper than cable.  Between Amazon by the show and Netflix, we aren't missing anything we wished to see, and we're saving a bundle!  I would do the amazon prime instant thing, but they just didn't have what we wanted yet.  Maybe later..... as it grows...
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works great ....I listen to music and play this game to relax!  I like the option to quickly complete a win and to chose a winning hand<br />!
B004LWZW8S|2.0|Not worth the money people! it wasn't the greatest storyline i've seen. The battle sequences were okay but not great. If you're gonna buy this film wait till the price goes to at least $10, that's honestly how low i value this film. I made the mistake of buying it without watching in theaters. Don't make the same mistake.
B000HEWEDK|4.0|A truly groundbreaking film -- the first large-scale non-B list sci fi flick.  Star Trek owes so much to this film.  2001 A Space Odyssey reaches the same level of story sophistication in this genre.  There are some painfully dated elements, but overall a fine film.
B004SYP5WC|4.0|I've been using this alot, just to keep up with what's coming up due on my bills.  I used to do the same thing on little note cards, just so I wouldn't lose track with all of our auto paid bills.  it does the same thing, just automatically.  I can mark them off as paid or delete as I go.<br /><br />It's not a check book balancer, which I didn't need, it's just a handy bill reminder.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is I don't get a balance of what's due between paychecks, so I have to do the math myself.  it gives me some sort of balance at the top corner, but I can't figure out what it's adding up to get that number.
1451627289|1.0|I've read many King stories and found several very engrossing but 15 years ago or so I started feeling his work had become repetitive fluff. I don't know if it is him or me. I hope it is me. Getting stuck on any one genre or author isn't a good thing for the mind. I picked this up and was glad I did. It started out with a great premise and I like time travel stories. According to my Kindle I am about 15% into the book and that's about all I can take.<br /><br />There is too much stuff that has nothing to do with advancing the story. OK, I now know King is an environMENTAList and I know his politics. Isn't that nice. I also know he feels it's OK to put down dumb people. If that's not bad enough he is indoctrinating people toward his views. He knows it but most readers won't. I can tell where this story is going and I see no need to spend my time coming to an unhappy and goofy conclusion. To those that think this is great stuff, it isn't. It's cheap pulp fluff, enjoy.
1400049628|5.0|This book is cool. I have had some ideas in an event of a zombie apocalypse. I know that i like imagining what i'd do in such a scenario. This book helps the reader come up with some ideas to improve your chance for survival. If you're a walking dead fan i think you will love this book. The book rationalizes the methods of survival seen in the tv show and in other zombie movies. I got to page 50 on my first sit down. You go through the pages quick when you're having fun reading it. I definitely recommend buying this book.

B0019N8P2W|4.0|The Daria shows are timeless and fun. High School sucks at any age. Old hardcore fans like me will notice that the music has changed. I'd be willing to pay a lot to find the old shows, since they had a better feel of the stupid nienties. Then again who would like to remeniss about the nienties anyway.

0345529057|5.0|I never heard of the books until the HBO series came out and boy did i immediately love it. I bought the 4 books but am waiting till summer to read them; I can't wait. The item comes in a nice box with a character on either end of it and they are small books. I would definitely buy this product, you won't regret it! Winter Is Coming
B00005LIN0|5.0|This production of \\"Porgy and Bess\\" brings tears to my eyes, not merely for the terrible sadness depicted as sadness is depicted in all operas, but also for the blessed talent of the cast and its director, and its writers and composer as well.  I could not stop marveling at the brilliant performance by one and all.<br />  I cannot help but feel somewhat angry that life must be inevitably sad for almost everyone, but I can truly feel pride and joy when I witness members of the human race capture through writing and music and singing and acting part of the sadness and perform it for others to feel with their hearts.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Good reading, easy to get absorbed in the tale. Looking forward to the next two in the series. Suzanne Collins paint a vivid picture and opens up your imagination. Loved it.

0761169253|5.0|As I write this, graduation season is barely a month away. If all you can give to a high-school graduate headed on to college--indeed, to any graduate moving on to a creative endeavor of any sort--is this book, it will be enough. Believe it or not, this book tells all they'll need to know to succeed.<br /><br />Yes, it's short. No, it doesn't say much. But what it does say is worth thinking about. And it's worth hearing again in those moments when we're moved to ponder just what we can do to get closer to being the successful person we think we want to be.<br /><br />In that respect, reading this book is like having a chat with a trustworthy mentor.<br /><br />Even though e-books are gaining in popularity, I think this book is best appreciated in its paperback form. You'll see it lying around, pick it up, read a random chapter or page, and end up feeling comforted and inspired all at the same time. As I said, it's like having a chat with a more experienced person you can trust.<br /><br />And in case you do decide to make it a gift, the paperback's easier to wrap.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|its an awesome app but i really do wish it could be used offline. that would make it the best app in the world!!

B0015DROBO|5.0|This book is the first from a trilogy written by Steig Larson.  This is an amazing and intriguing mystery trilogy.  The story is based in Sweden and tells the story of an amazing adventure and investigation of the two main characters.  Through this investigation the two main characters not only solved a cold case, but built a long lasting friendship.<br /><br /> The story is set in modern day, 2002, Sweden.  The story is based around two main characters.  The first character is Mikael Blomkvist, who is the publisher of a political magazine called Millennium.  The story starts off with Mikael losing a case involving a rich industrialist named Hans-Eric Winstrom.  Mikael is sentenced to three months in prison and a large fine which causes him to step down from his position at the magazine.  However, suddenly Mikael is offered a job by the former CEO of the Vanger Corporation, Henrik Vanger.  Henrik asks Mikael to research the disappearance of his niece, Harriet Vanger, which has become a cold case.  In return for Mikael's work Henrik offers to give Mikael evidence against Winstrom.  During his investigation Mikael meets the second main character, Lisbeth Salander.  Lisbeth is a freelance private investigator who has her own take on the law.  Lisbeth is approached by Mikael and asked to help in his investigation.  During the investigation Mikael and Lisbeth become intimate, but this does not seem to affect their work.  After a lot of digging and research they not only discovered that Gottfried Vanger, Harriet's father, and Martin Vanger, Harriet's brother, were rapists and murderers, but they also found that Harriet was still alive.  In the end, Henrik was not able to keep up his side of the deal and did not give Mikael sufficient evidence against Winstrom.  However, Lisbeth used her investigational and computer skills to find evidence against Winstrom and helped Mikael bring down Winstrom.<br /><br /> The book was originally written in Swedish and translated into English.  This made it a little more difficult of a read.  Since I do not know much about Sweden or their language it took me a little while to get into the rhythm of the story.  Learning to read the names of the towns, cities, and characters was difficult at the beginning.  Also, many of the norms in Sweden are different from that of our own and made this not only an interesting read but also a learning experience.  Being able to learn the customs and curtsies while enjoying a thrilling mystery novel was quite an experience. It is also rumored that Larson based this trilogy on life experiences and facts.  Fore example, Larson has a magazine called expo which seemed to be similar to, Millennium, the magazine mentioned in the book.  Also, almost all the paces mentioned were real Swedish cities and towns.<br /><br /> This book kept my attention through every page.  The introduction of the story started off a little slow; however I felt that it was a perfect pace for me to find the rhythm of the writer.  The writing style of the Swedish writer was different from most other writings that I have read.  Larson took an interesting approach to this story.  In most novels you have one main character in which the story follows.  However, Larson bases this story on both Mikael and Lisbeth.  At the beginning it is almost like Larson is writing two completely different stories about two characters.  He alternated chapters to tell the stories of the two characters.  Once the characters met the story started to meld together until every chapter was a story of the two characters and the adventure that they were involved in together.<br /><br /> This book also pushed the envelope with its level of graphic explanations of the heinous crimes that were committed.  Larson's ability in description made you feel like you were there witnessing the events.  When Lisbeth was victim to rape you felt her pain and at the same time you felt sheer disgust.  When you read about the rapes and murders committed you will have goose bumps run down your back.<br /><br /> Larson made me laugh, cry and feel intense fear while reading this book.  His characters became a real part of my laugh that I did not want to let go of.  This book was a great read.  I couldn't wait to read the next book in the trilogy and this book is now a permanent piece in my library.<br /><br />Larson, S. (2008). The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (R. Keeland, Trans.).

B0044XV3QY|5.0|This movie in Blu-Ray is the best i've seen so far. I've seen LOTR, The Matrix Trilogy, Game of Thrones, Tron: Legacy, Transformers: Dark of The Moon, The Dark Knight, on and on. Avatar is the best; the color is amazing. The people who are looking for a movie to really enjoy Blu-Ray need to buy this film because it is the best out there right now. That is my opinion. You will be amazed by the color!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I need to get the rest of this series right away! I'm so excited. I just finished another first in a series ([[ASIN:B00729GQ0A THE FOREVER GIRL (an Urban Fantasy / Paranormal Romance Novel of the Occult) (Forever Girl Series #1)]]) and I was a little upset I had to wait for the next book in that series. HUNGER GAMES isn't just giving me something to read in the meantime. It's giving me something to love! Add this to my addictions list! I have a thing for stories with characters that transcend their story and this fits the bill. I just got into reading again and I'm very picky. I only review books I love so I'm so super excited I've now found two great books this month. I hope the rest of the Hunger Games series is this good! Katniss, I love you!
B005EGXNLS|3.0|Let me begin by saying I'm a Cornwell glutton, having devoured the Grail Quest, Warlord series, Saxon Chronicles, Stonehenge, etc. He's an undisputed master of historical fiction. Normally, I'd have awarded Death of Kings five stars without opening the cover of my e-reader! For that reason, I didn't hesitate to order the book, despite the stiff price tag. But once I realized how abbreviated this installment is, I was sorely disappointed. It isn't all about the money, although that did sting. (Yes, Amazon, we know you tried to keep e-book prices reasonable before the greed-meisters got their mitts on us!) After having waited two years with bated breath for Uhtred's next appearance, this book felt more like a novella. That may seem like splitting hairs but if you become attached to favorite characters, as I do, he'll be there & gone before you have time to slide the napkin out of the ring!<br /><br />Please, Mr. C., put more meat on Book 7. This one was just too lean.

B007JRUCGO|5.0|My son picked this movie and it was very good. It could be a teaching tool for motivational as well as inspiratonal teaching for children and adults. This is a great family film, with values that could be incorporated in everyday life. I love how the actors have brought the characters to life. Showing through animation that things can work out and obsticles can be over came.

B004EPZ03O|3.0|The Muppets are back. The tale begins with a younger and unknown Muppet idolizing the old cast and inspiring Kermit the Frog to come out of retirement and get the old gang back together. Once they're together the old gang works at earning enough funding to reopen their theater. There's singing and music and lots of nostalgia for those who remember the original series but where's the humor? The movie reminded me of one of the more flat episodes compared to the good ones that made laugh hard in several spots. Cameos by several known actors. It was fun enough but it didn't have the magic of the original series. Don't worry about my opinion in affecting the next one, though. I'm sure there will be one as it won Best Song in 2012 by the Academy Awards. The budget for this film was $45M and it made a tad over $145M.<br /><br />CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus to B minus; HUMOR: C; SINGING/MUSICALS: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday; OVERALL GRADE: B minus.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|A badly written novel that channels 40 years of the male fantasies contained in their letters to Playboy. I do not believe the author is a woman!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This trilogy is one of the best series I've read in a very long time...It is so much deeper than a sexy novel...You feel so many emotions reading these books...Anastasia is feisty, sweet, cute, charming, loving, caring, determined and disarming...Christian is bossy, demanding, deep, sad, loveable, sexy, possessive, caring, and yet so insecure...Yes he has issues, but, you have to love him...you want to help him...you have hope for their future together.  Mostly, it's very erotic, sexy and exciting to read...I highly recommend this trilogy to everyone.

Performance is great but I'll rate it 3 stars because of the pin incident.
B0078N2MTE|5.0|No-name, normal-looking character actors perform splendidly in a film that is short on dialogue but provides an ambience that quietly creates and maintains start-to-finish tension with more subtly and understated style than anything I've seen before.  This is neither an over-the-top action-packed thriller nor a horror show that scares you out of your skin, but Take Shelter is so remarkably well made that it still leaves the viewer emotionally exhausted and wondering what exactly he or she has just seen.<br /><br />I have no name for a suitable genre, but this one-of-a-kind low-budget gem doesn't miss a beat in telling a tale of average people of the most decent sort caught up in a psychological and metaphysical maelstrom that no one understands.  There is nothing overwhelmingly appealing about any one of the characters, but they are the kind of folks we'd all like to a have as family, friends, and neighbors.  Nevertheless, difficult times, misunderstood encounters, and failures to make sense of the senseless take a toll on decent individuals and wholesome relationships.  Finding explanations for the inexplicable is nerve-wracking and can be pushed to maddening extremes.<br /><br />Take Shelter hints at a variety of narratives, but viewers who like things neat and tidy will probably be disappointed.  However, those who find interest in low-keyed characterization and the emotional pull of a cinematic context that is both plainly ordinary and decidedly off-beat will find this film rewarding.  I belong to the group that gives priority to a clearly defined narrative, but after giving it some thought, I'm glad I watched Take Shelter.  It's about as skillfully evocative as a film can get.

0307719219|3.0|When I first started out in the work force, I (like most new accountants) was placed in the audit unit.  After about four months, my supervisor pulled me aside to discuss my performance.  He said that I did great work, but that I needed to learn the \\"art of pageage\\".  Since I was unfamiliar with the term \\"pageage\\", I asked him what he meant.  He said that my audit work-papers tended to be a bit sparse, and that they needed to have more pages.  I became concerned with these comments, so I asked him if I was turning in incomplete or unsubstantiated work.  He assured me that my work was complete and well documented.  \\"But,\\" he said, \\"an audit and its findings are as much about perception as they are about the work that goes into them.  A thick set of work papers conveys a sense of thoroughness and the perception that you are an expert on the subject you audited.\\"  He went on to explain that I could take a point that I summarized on one spreadsheet and instead split it over several spreadsheets, thus creating several pages for the work-papers.  I was still a bit dumbfounded by this concept, so I said it sounded like he was asking me to create paper for the sake of creating paper.  He said no, but that I was documenting points \\"too efficiently\\" and that \\"spreading them out\\" would create an impression of completeness, and hence give credence to the findings/conclusions.  Sadly, I never did embrace the idea of \\"pageage\\", and therefore didn't last too long in the audit unit.  But, the whole episode came back to me as I was reading Why Nations Fail.  I was about a quarter of the way through the book when I found this sentence: \\"In the remaining chapters, we will discuss in greater detail how this institutional theory works and illustrate the wide range of phenomena it can account for.\\" I knew after reading what should have been an introductory chapter sentence a quarter of the way into the book that the authors subscribed to the concept of \\"pageage\\".<br /><br />The hypothesis that Acemoglu and Robinson present is that societies/cultures/nations which have economic and political structures that empower a wide swath of their populations have stronger economies than those whose economic and political structures favor a select few.  While the theorem's strength is that it has a common sense appeal, its weakness (from an academic point of view) is that it's almost too easy to understand, thereby requiring little documentation to build an effective case for supporting it.  Thus, Acemoglu and Robinson appear to have made the decision to enhance the book's credibility by utilizing \\"pageage\\" in the form of numerous examples.  While these examples are useful if one plans to go on Jeopardy, the effectiveness of the examples is so inconsistent that they end up burying the thesis instead of supporting it.<br /><br />There are some good qualities in Why Nations Fail:  it contains a sound thesis; it is written in an accessible manner; and it presents a true moderate approach to its conclusions (meaning, that people on both the left and the right will find things they like in the book).  But, by inserting a lot of unnecessary examples, Acemoglu and Robinson end up trying to manufacture credibility instead of relying on the inherent strength of their thesis.  While \\"pageage\\" may have its place in auditing, Why Nations Fail proves that it is not a concept that works in the presentation of an argument that already has merit.
B000A3VTT8|5.0|I've seen 2 other Cenerentolas, and this is by far the best.<br />Cast is not just one superstar, but 6-7 really good<br />singers in perfect form at the height of their careers.<br />I think von Stade just retired this year here in the Bay Area.<br /><br />However, I'm commenting because this is my 3yo daughter's<br />favorite DVD.  In fact, when she sees Disney Cinderella<br />on screen, she says \\"I want to see the real cinderella instead\\".<br />She's probably watched her favorite arias 50 times now.<br />She knows the story, and since the actors expressions<br />are fairly expressive, she knows that \\"she's sad\\", \\"the<br />daddy is angry\\", etc.<br /><br />Both of the kids have seen various other operas including<br />Barbiere and Mozart's Figaro, but they have a hard time<br />following the story (and having your 8yo interrupt every<br />30 secs to ask what is happening gets old).  This opera<br />also has a lot more singing and very little recitativo.<br /><br />Show this to your kids early, show it to them often.<br />And I don't have to listen to Barney in the background.
B006PTZNSY|1.0|First off this album sounds just as mediocre as her first one. This album is all over the place just like she is. She needs to stick to one genre and to be honest pop is the only genre that is making her sell really well. Anybody wish to challenge that, just go back to \\"Superbass\\" Pop Turn me on Pop Starships, pop!. The track Roman Reloaded is a good track but it would've sounded much better without Lil' Wayne. I think it's quite sad how Nicki Minaj is now desperate for selling her album for 5 dollars when in reality it's not even worth 50 cent's. Anyhow don't waste your time buying it just listen to it off the web FOR FREE!

B007PS0X0W|1.0|I'm a fan of the Underworld series, but this movie was positively horrible. Definitely done to try and continue to squeeze some money out of the fans. The entire plot and the whole film seems like it should be 30 minutes of a longer, more developed plot. It begins and ends very unspectacularly. Just absolutely atrocious. Save your money on this one.
1400064287|1.0|I find it really ironic that the first chapter is about urban myths and very first example they give in the book is that movie popcorn is unhealthy for you because they use coconut oil to pop it - and coconut oil contains a lot of saturated fat. Well the myth is that all saturated fats are bad for you - actually only partially hydrogenated and trans fats are bad. Coconut oil is actually probably the *BEST* kind of oil to make popcorn in because it doesnt break down in high heat. They did a study in the 1950's where they tried to fatten up livestock by feeding them cheap coconut oil. The opposite happened - the cattle actually became leaner and healthier. Also Vincent Price did famous research in the 1930's where he studied indigenous Pacific Islanders whose main staple was coconut oil - something like 40% of their diet. Surprisingly he found they had virtually no instances of heart disease whatsoever. Hope the authors read this and debunk this myth in the 2nd edition.....

0061726834|5.0|This book grabbed my attention from the moment I saw the synopsis. Love is a disease. How many times in life have we thought this for just a moment? I was intrigued so I picked it and I devoured it.<br /><br />The premise of the story is simple, love is a disease, it must be dealt with, avoided until cured. The way that the author introduced this idea amazed me. She had me thinking, wow I can totally see how this could be seen as a disease. Love makes you do things you normally wouldn't do. Love makes you think of only that one person's happiness. Love will end up hurting you and in the end one could even die from love. Makes sense to me. I have been here. This is all very true. So what would a world without love is like, or from the main character, Len's point of view, what would the world be like with love.<br /><br />Lena believes everything that is taught about the disease amor deliria nervosa. She believes a world where everyone has this disease is unthinkable. She never wants to get this disease, she wants to be cured, and she wants to live the life of happiness. She is scared of this disease, until the day she falls in love. Lena will now know the truth about this disease.<br /><br />Lena is a very lovable character for me. She is smart, brave, and independent. What she believes in is something she has been taught her entire life and yet when the time comes to question it, she doesn't hesitate. She meets Alex, she falls in love, she knows her life will be different now, she embraces it.<br /><br />This book had me hooked from the beginning. The setting, the story, the characters, the writing style, it was all perfect for me. The romance was well done, the characters well built, the story well thought out. I couldn't have asked for more. This will be another one to add to my reread bookshelf.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|fun fun fun the game has a lot of ads but still worth the download. Good game overall.  it's kinda like playing Mario
B003Y5H5HO|3.0|Having first watched the original extended versions of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl who Played with Fire and The Girl who Kicked the Hornets' Nest, I was rather disappointed with the new Daniel Craig version. The Swedish version starring Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist is absolutely brilliant and gripping throughout. Watch the Millennium Trilogy with a friend over a weekend. You will thoroughly enjoy the experience.

B007SPPANM|5.0|It is not surprising to see people ride the wave of re-popularity is receiving. James Cameron's masterpiece is well worth watching, rewatching, and owning.<br /><br />I wonder however what special features will be on these new releases?

B005NKGEP2|1.0|This was one of the worst books I have read. It had great reviews and I can't figure out why.  The characters were one dimensional and the plot was hard to follow with a story line which jumped back and forth. There were unnecessary descriptions and confusing time lines.  Basically, the story about an ex-CIA agent and her computer savy husband was unbelievable.  It was impossible to connect with the characters and in the end my only reaction was \\"who cares?\\"  Don't waste your time or money on this one.
B0002EXH5O|1.0|OK, I don't actually own this reproduction however it scares the s**t out of me that this album has been re-released without \\"Take no prisoners\\". which is the most powerful track on the album.  This is one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time, but it is useless without \\"Take no prisoners\\".

B004LOMB2Q|1.0|Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not paranoid but us end users have got to start paying attention to the permissions. I've uninstalled Evernote and other apps that request permission to access far too much personal info and other unreasonable items.  The only way to stop this is to let the devs know it will no longer be tolerated.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is a cute little game. it reminds me of the facebook games.  with energy to use and tasks to do
B007NVI0VA|5.0|These characters are entertaining and sect .  enjoy the series.  The love triangle between the brothers and the heroine is provocative.
0316067938|3.0|BREAKING DAWN was first published in 2008, so we all know the spoilers whether we've read the book or not. Well, I've read it, and you'll get the most out of it if you surrender to the crazy:<br /><br />-Bruise-porn, featuring feathers. Also: breaking headboards, the sequel.<br />-Edward proposing to Jacob that he knocks up Bella. (Seriously, there's mention of \\"puppies\\", which had me in tears of laughter, thinking of Bella giving birth to dogs.)<br />-Foetus is killing Bella. (Pregnancy is freaking effed-up, y'all. You have someone, or something, growing inside you, and it's FEEDING ON YOU. Damn, nature - you scary!)<br />-A teenager imprints on a baby. (The werewolves claim it's nothing sexual, but in the Twilight-verse EVERYTHING is sexual, whether it means to be or not.)<br /><br />The crazy made me laugh, and if nothing else at least made this novel somewhat entertaining. But my word, this tome is too effing long: 757 pages. A lot of that is unnecessary, repetition, hyperbole, and so on. Cut out the faff, and you'd have a better book.<br /><br />But perhaps what's most surprising about BREAKING DAWN is it doesn't feature nearly as much conflict as it should. This is a problem I often have, particularly with romance fiction: the author suggests there could be bigger conflict, but instead takes the easy way out so the story and the readers are poorer off because of it.<br /><br />At first Edward, Jacob, and whoever else agrees that the foetus must be killed if Bella is to survive. But a magical thing happens in the womb: love, and psychic communication. The foetus loves everyone, and in turn they all love her, regardless that she's killing her mother. And when Renesmee is born and develops rapidly - including speaking in full sentences, even though no one teaches her English or anything - they love her even more. Where's the bloody conflict in that?<br /><br />The Volturi are very disappointing, not fighting to the death. Maybe because Bella's a vampire now, andshe's the most powerful vampire ever without even training, that of course she can easily defeat her rivals. But the Cullen gang doesn't even kill the Volturi, though they could. The author's probably trying to say that it's possible to achieve a happy ending with minimal death, but it doesn't make for entertaining reading.<br /><br />There is one good thing about the happy ending, though: Nahuel. He and his aunt Huilen have the most fascinating story, it kind of makes one wonder why we had to sit through the Cullens when these nomads would've made a much more interesting, less anti-feminist, tale. It disappoints me when authors don't live up to their potential.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Its a great puzzle game i would suggest to anyone. it has simple gameplay and is very relaxing. I got it that day it was free but it still would have been worth it if a payed for it.
0439023513|1.0|Collins let a lot of people down with this one.  The story doesn't hold together.  Characters and relationships are left undeveloped.  It left me angry that I spent so much time on this series only to see it go nowhere.
1423113454|5.0|Rick riordon is a masterful and engaging author. He keeps me on the edge of my seat with each book he writes.  His subject matter is interesting and imaginative.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i play this app 24/7! i love it! best app ever! you wont be disapointed. ads are a tad annoying but easy to skip over.
B005AEQX0C|1.0|I haven't even received in the mail so I wouldn't know how it is. I hope it comes but it's past it's arrival date.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I have not read the series of books, however, the gnome series is nothing short of amazing. I love the story line, and I love how well each character is developed, albeit there are a ton of them! Bought the first season last wk and finished it within two days, and I like it so much that I ordered hbo so that I could tune in to watch the season 2. I can't wait to pick up where first season left off!!! If you are an adult who likes a complex but powerful storyline this is for you. But I will say, I was not prepared for all the sexuality in the series, so that may be something to look out for.
B006SV2LWA|2.0|The basic plot is about a contagion that quickly spreads and kills, while the medical community races to stop it and create a vaccine. Unlike in the movie Outbreak, Contagion has no needed moments of comic relief. No smiles. No bits of humor. It is grim and depressing throughout. Though that's how things would be in real life should a pandemic breakout out, it provides agonizing entertainment. Despite the many stars, including an appearance by Dr. Sanjay Gupta, I didn't care about any of the characters.<br /><br />Though I'm glad I only rented this DVD, I feel that I wasted my money anyway.
B007P3TMW2|1.0|Saw this in the theatre. Never saw an audience stunned into silence by a bad movie. And Sandra Bullock & Tom Hanks have a total of 20 minutes in it. Don't waste your time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is pretty good cause you don't just get points you have to earn them. its cool and you need to get this game I would never delete it and neither will you once you play it.
B006MGC3VK|4.0|OSI stands out in a crowd. They have developed a sound, that is independent from the mainstream. Fire Make Thunder only furthers this belief i hold as fact. Kevin Moore seems to have left a considerably bigger stamp on this one though, as hints of Chroma Key shine through the cracks at times. Especially on the track For Nothing, which sounds as if it could have been directly pulled from Graveyard Mountain Home. The album in general is softer, which is nice because the nuances come through more, even the electronics that Moore peppers throughout this recording. As a matter of personal preference, i enjoyed this album more than Blood, but less than Free and their debut. To each their own, i suppose. The craftsmanship is stellar on all of their releases, and Fire Make Thunder scratches a particular itch that the others simply do not. Being that it is more subtle, and thoughtful. The addition of Gavin Harrison is welcomed, but ultimately does little to shape their established sound. He's more of a hired hand.
B006QPVH6O|1.0|Had this annoying, \\"flashing\\" movie not given me a serious headache it would have put me to sleep. The shaky camera syndrome goes over the top with constant pops of static, electrifying flashes of light, fadeouts and rolling flips...all to the point of nausea. The camera never stops bobbing, dipping and weaving. We're supposed to believe this is actual lost footage of a real moon mission, but we had much better camera technology back then.<br /><br />The astronauts are sent to the moon. They land within walking distance of a failed Russian craft with its innards ripped apart. There's blood all over the place. The astronauts discover a mummified Russian cosmonaut in the bottom of a crater. A moon rock is embedded in his suit.<br /><br />I can't even explain why this movie is so bad without giving away all its secrets. It's absolute rubbish from the first frame to the last.<br /><br />There's no point in going on about it. I won't give away the secret of the moon rocks or why the ending was impossible. I can't even explain why the astronauts didn't take flashlights with them. Luckily, I only rented it for a couple of bucks. Trash movies like this are the reason I no longer spend big bucks at the theaters.
B007EC27QM|5.0|the best so far I really like it on the kindle fire it is great!!<br />I like having % on it.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|even Though this is a good game, especially for being free, there's no arguing this isn't anmario ripoff. I mean EVERYTHING is the same...
B007K3JCAE|1.0|I loved the first Holmes outing with Downey Jr. and Law.  I missed the sequel in the theaters and would normally purchase this film site unseen by pre-ordering from Amazon.com (this review focuses on the scam of Ultraviolet and not the movie--I'm giving the movie five stars without ever seeing it and just hearing what my brother thought of it). HOWEVER, after the burn I received when pre-ordering \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" from Amazon I will NEVER do so again.  I enjoyed TGWTDT movie. When I went to retrieve the digital copy is when all things went south. I had no exposure to this Ultraviolet scam.  I complained to the movie company (Sony) and they told me they could not issue a code to download a digital copy from iTunes. This put me over the edge because my wife purchased the final Harry Potter film (Deathly Hallows Part 2) as a gift and it also only came with an ultraviolet copy. When I took my case to Warner Bros. they sent me a code for an iTunes download within 24 hours. Sony said that is something they're unable to do when I complained about the Dragon Tattoo movie (Amazon.com never got back to me when I complained about the ultraviolet copy for TGWTDT).<br /><br />So long story short, I would have already PRE-ORDERED the newest installment in the Holmes saga helmed by Ritchie. However, I'm just going to wait and spend my dollars at Apple's iTunes so I can have a truly digital copy.  I'll keep my eyes open at my local Wal-Mart for a good deal on the Blu-Ray a few weeks after the release. I know I\\"m only one person, but I hope this trend spreads so Amazon and the movie companies wake up and realize their ultraviolet copy offer is not desired and in fact loses them business.
B0009PAVI2|5.0|This is a great little holster for under $20. I will definitely be wearing this while I'm out shooting more often, and it will allow me to use several of my filters more often as they won't be just crammed into my camera bag! The holster itself is much bigger then I thought it would be, but it's fine because it makes getting filters in and out very easy. I agree with a previous reviewer about the the velcro being unnecessary, and loud. If you're planning to use this to shoot wildlife, then either plan to do something about the velcro or find a different holster. Wouldn't be hard to just put a piece of duct tape over it, and then problem solved.<br /><br />All in all I highly recommend this holster. Also Amazon's 2 day shipping had this to me in less then 24 hours, amazing!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Lotd of ads.  I can ignore them but they are irritating.  The games are fun but the controls on half of them are clunky and sluggish.
B004LUS390|4.0|This app is like a mini photoshop, so if you have ever used that this won't be difficult to use.  It is a powerful, handy drawing tool for a very good price and much more versatile than another drawing app I tried.  It even used layers, has a brush editing system, and several different tools that are very cool- like the symmetry button.  It might be a little difficult for newbies, but it's worth the while to learn.  Now I want a stylus pen! Only complaints so far: canvas does not rotate and there is no smudge tool.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I downloaded it to my Kindel Fire and it works just as good as it does on my home PC.  If you like this game you'll really enjoy the app
B007DIQB50|5.0|I can best describe my reaction to Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded as BLOWN AWAY. I had high expectations after Pink Friday, her stellar debut record, but this one pushes Nicki in an even more creative artistic direction. This album is essentially a double album, the first half her hardcore rap alter ego Roman Zolanski, the second half her bubbly, poppy Harajuku Barbie. The album ends with the fantastic \\"Stupid H**\\", bringing together both personalities and unifying the experience you just listened to.<br /><br />Some may criticize Ms. Minaj for her veering into pop, but that's not even new for her; Pink Friday had plenty of pop hits, most notably the spectacular \\"Super Bass.\\" Nicki is a master at every genre she tackles, and PF: RR is a fantastic way to showcase her marvelous ability.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is certainly, without a doubt, the finest war movie ever made.  It may be one of the best movies of ANY genre ever made.  Also, from what I can tell doing some internet research, it is also one of the most accurate.  I'll give an update after I read the book and Dick Winter's journal, both of which I just ordered from Amazon.  The sets, the photography, the acting, the soundtrack, even the casting -- all first rate.  Everyone should see this.
B0009VSB06|5.0|I purchased this Garrett ACE 150 Metal Detector to help find parts that I lost off of my plow.  We found the missing parts in a plowed field in about an hour.  They were about at least 8 inches deep.  THe Garrett ACE 150 paid for itself more than twice over on the first trip out.  My daughter can't wait to try it around the house and buildings.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put the book down!.  I heard about this book from Good Morning America.  I purchased also purchased Fifty Shades Darker, Fifty Shades Freed!.  Looking forward to read all of them!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great game! There are so many different games to choose from. You will never get tired of it.
0439023491|5.0|The second part of the Hunger Games is absolutely stunning. The author shows her powerful ideas and not only increase the conflicts but also provide unbroken chain of arguments about the current problems after the 74 annual Hunger Game and before the universal 75 (gold) hunger games. I  can say that strongly prefer to read about Katniss and Peeta than Gale and other. The most powerful side of this book is the contrast between different characters - president Snow / Katniss, Peeta / Heumich and even Efi, Sina and etc. The idea for the next hunger games is absolutely amazing, I can compare it with Harry Potter / Goblet of Fire. Probably the strongest part of the book. And finally, the transition between the first and the second book is pretty invisible that makes the reader feeling satisfy from reading one (not two separate books.)
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|We downloaded this on my kindle fire for the 2 year old and he loves this program. He figured out how to use it on his own. I highly recommend this.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|The graphics and soundtrack are beautiful and calming, the puzzles are interesting, complex, and rise in challenge at a nice rate. Great game!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good classic game new twist. loving it man Oregon trail like I'm 10 all over again but where is the real game that should be next
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is like a challange it would be a good game for people who likes puzzles its difficult its fun what next
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Worked great pre ICS, now it locks up my Asus transformer after less than 1 minute!  Please fix!! Five stars if it's fixed, less than 1 star now.  Paid for the app and can't play it!
B002VPE1XE|4.0|This case works perfectly well for a Nikon P7000 as long as one is using a \\"wrist strap\\" setup versus a \\"neck strap\\". The wrist strap can hang out the top side underneath the enclosing flap for a secure quick draw. I like it.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|however I am not sure this is suitable reading for teens or kids right before bed-time. I do think this book is more suited for an adult, grown-up audience, but then adults beware! This book will capture your mind and you will not be able to stop reading it. Right after reading the Hunger Games I read the other 2 books in the series and they were just as capturing as the first installment.<br />This is one of the best books I read this year - and I definately recommend reading the book over watching the movie.Great book, I am sure I will read it again and again and again.
B005OHSUQK|5.0|This is the best show. I can't wait for the next season. You become addicted and wish you were a biker.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game so far.  I enjoy the thinking around corners that is required. Nice to see a well designed puzzle game like this.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is awesome because u will never get bored of it there are so many games on it and u get to play ur favorite games over and over
B004MC8CA2|4.0|The creators off this app certainly did an awesome job.  The only complaint I have is that you cannot view your notes or highlight when offline. They really need to correct this. Otherwise this is the best Bible app I have come across yet. Awesome!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a good first book in the series and hooks you with an interesting post apocalyptic world with engaging characters and dramatic violence.  A fast and enjoyable read.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I like this game rocks because it is free and it isnlike a real game that you would play on a viedogame
B006HH5ZM8|4.0|This has one of my all time favorite David bowie songs \\"something in the air\\" and is an overall very pleasant album. Bowie took a more simplistic approach having switching outside and earthling's dark glitchy moods for more acoustic and organic feel. Still the album has enough edginess to not let you forget that this is still David Bowie.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was a good conclusion to the series but I was never really excited about the \\"love\\" triangle and how that played out in this book.  Overall a good series I'm glad I read.
B007R41E8O|1.0|it is pretty stinking slow and doesn't rub the game too well on my galaxy tab 8.9. doesn't show the narrative description of what is going on (narration is a blur). I like these kind of games too. it is too bad this doesnt work well with my tegra 2 processor
B0055SWM08|5.0|good game. works perfect in samsung galaxy tab 7. recommended to all ages. lots of levels. so far enjoyed well. will edit comment if found any issues
B0063IH60K|5.0|Smooth action, play with awesome graphics. My boys also like to play. My four year old has figured out how it works on his own!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game cuz its just like Mario.it also has diff levels to it!! u must get this game!!
B0074EIQQU|5.0|A masterpiece of controlled chaos, darkness and the surreal dreamscape that's just as pleasant as it is nightmarish.<br /><br />That's the first thing I thought when I heard this album. As a fan of The Mars Volta for 6 years, I'll admit I was just a tad doubtful as to whether or not they could ace it on this album. But a 3 year break did give me some hope, as until then they'd been releasing albums constantly. On this album you can tell they took some time to really give it their all.<br /><br />This album, for one is very surprisingly DARK. I'll admit I was a hit shocked at the first track- not that I didn't like it, I actually loved it, but it was unexpectedly very dark. It even kind of resembles a Dance of Death era Iron Maiden track, meets Stabbing Westward and Pendulum. Thankfully, it set the tone for the rest of the album.<br /><br />Most of the album has a very dreamy, surreal feel to it. The signature sound of The Mars Volta is still there, but it's mixed with darker and lower key elements that give it a very diverse feel. I'm honestly unsure of what my favourite track is. I'd say it's In Absentia, as well as I love Trinkets Pale of Moon. Both are very dreamy and chaotic yet oh so controlled.<br /><br />I especially love the new drummer. I'll admit I wasn't a huge fan of Thomas Pridgen's going Crazy every 5 seconds does get tiresome after a while, so Deantoni Parks's newer style definitely owns the place. Also, I love how the band has managed to keep the uber high vocals to a bare minimum. Cedric's chipmunk vocals were annoying on the last couple albums, and thankfully they're very seldom here.<br /><br />In short, do buy this album. It's a sign the band still have it in them. You won't regret it!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote.is my &quot;go to&quot; program for all my notes.  I love that it is automatically synced on my computers as well as my Kindle Fire and I can access it from anywhere. I'm always recommending it to my friends.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|I went back and read \\"The Godfather\\" and it was such a great satisfying read.  I could see the characters and hear the dialogue, really this is an exceptional book.  Maybe it helps to visualize the movie and hear that hauntingly beautiful music, but still... a classic.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|This is technically the \\"third\\" release from Halestorm but its second with original material. The excellent EP Reanimate containing some well executed covers was released at the end of the year 2011 in to 2012. This followup just puts the stamp on a wonderful band who knows how to play a great tune.  The vocals by Lizzy Hale are fantastic while the production is top notch. Sure, there are a couple of poppy songs but there is an equal share of rocking ones as well making it a well rounded set.  It is the best rock release thus far in the young 2012 year.  It is well worth the purchase... as good, if not better, than their first album of original music. Give it a spin...
B007PTJOV0|1.0|this app is just copying super Mario bros and even super Mario bros stinks. but if u like another boring app on the kindle fire its perfect for u
B004SYP5WC|5.0|hi, this seller is wonderful, very fast shipping. The item is exactly as described. with this item you couldn't tell if it refurbish, it looks so new. been using it for a week so far and it amazing TV.  The TV is very big and loving it since.  Thank you so much
B007PTJOV0|5.0|if you loved Mario you will love playing this game as well....You run and jump just like in Mario you also collect things as well..
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love it. really like to play! seems to keep moving with no down time just waiting. great for young kids just block purchases
1577314808|1.0|Time is a beautiful thing because it heals and allows you to forget.  The more time I spend away from this book and forget all the \\"dysfunction\\" it caused my vulnerable mind to label myself with, the better.  Time heals, time teaches, time is a part of this Earth and a necessary part.  There is no point in demonizing it, your mind or your ego.  There are some truths that I believe Eckhart has come across in his journey to understand the very real experience he had at age 29 but I believe he mistakenly demonized his ego which he believed to be the source of all Evil and the thing that would pull him back into his unbearable suffering.  Suffering is and always will be a part of life.  The best we can do is to love ourselves and all of humanity and this planet and also love all of who we are on this earth which includes an ego, a body, a mind and a spirit.  If we are all one, all those things are one in us and it is futile and unnecessary to attempt to split these apart in yourself.  You were born divine, perfect and that is who you are truly.  You do not have to try to spiritual or enlightened, you just have to learn and trust yourself and never listen to someone who makes you feel bad about yourself.  I highly recommend Anita Moorjani's book \\"Dying to be me\\" as therapy to get back in touch with your feelings if you have felt discouraged and defeated as I did after reading this book.  I don't mean to bash Eckhart.  I think he truly started writing in an attempt to help others and share his experience but he is not always right in his assumptions.  Peace and love to you all.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is not the normal read for me but when I saw all the publicity I decided to give it a try. You need to read all 3 books for the desired impact I believe.....I did enjoy the adventure.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I missed playing a game like this. good for when I cant get on facebook to check my other games
B0059XTUB8|5.0|So at my house this woman is a collectors item for my wife. Purchased this DVD for her as a little kicker anniversary present. Came fast..too fast had to give it to her to keep her from renting it at the video store. she was pleased.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Very similar to Frontierville on Facebook but with missions. Very enjoyable for a free game. Both my son and I enjoy playing this game.
0345803485|4.0|The book started out a little slow for me but revved up pretty quickly.  As a lot of people have said, I'm not big into the BDSM stuff but it wasn't actually as bad as I worried it would be.  I became hooked on this book and found myself laughing at parts with the characters and, in the end, had tears coursing down my cheeks.  Cannot wait to receive the next 2 books!
0439023513|1.0|My wife and oldest daughter were huge fans of the series. Saw the movie and loved it.  We recently went on vacation and I decided to give Hunger Games a try.  I loved the first 2 novels.  Mockingjay was terrible.  Overly depressing and violent (describing children's body parts after an explosion - really?).  The first 2 were close to pushing the envelop on \\"Young Adult\\" novels.  I am an avid reader and have read plenty Stephen King, Clive Barker, Dean Koontz, etc..  This book is one of the most violent I have read.  Plot was rambling.  Main character's self-loathing unbearable.  All I can say is this was really, really bad.  Parents beware if you \\"Young Adults\\" are going to read this.
B004OC07N0|5.0|I read it long time ago and it's my bible every time I move from job to job. I recommend this book.<br /><br />Luis Cantu
B0017I1FO4|5.0|Shinedown's debut album was no doubt their definitive album, yet Sound of Madness is without a doubt their absolute best album thus far in my wife and I's opinion!  So fricken awesome all the way through!  It was awesome to get the privilage to see many of these songs performed live too...Shinedown is amazing in concert!  If you're a rock fan and not yet that familiar with Shinedown (I don't see how you couldn't have) then you need to check them out, and I recommend starting with this and their debut album Leave A Whisper.  Get on it!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I like Leps World because it's funny when a bug or snail falls into lava or water.<br />GO LEP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I Hate Spikes!!!!!!!!
B005PTYOTE|5.0|I remember seeing the first 2 of these movies with my dad and brother in the theatre when I was younger...and then number 3 with a good friend of mine after it's release.  Great movies!  I had owned them all on DVD at one point but had gotten rid of them eventually after I had gotten a Blu-Ray player, because I was decided on upgrading them to Blu-Ray, as I felt they were Blu-Ray worthy titles.  It took me a while, but I finally got this set of them, and just in time too, as Ghost Protocol is due out on DVD & Blu-Ray within a few days of me writing this review.  It, too, was also a great movie and I will be buying it on Blu-Ray as well.  Great movies if anybody has never seen them...I recommend checking them out!
0439023513|2.0|I had been warned by many friends that mockingjay was their least favorite in the hunger games series.  I'm not usually one to be swayed by outside opinion, so I started mockingjay looking for things that I liked about the book.  Unfortunately Suzanne Collins bit of more than she could chew with this book and the result is a hastily written, unimaginative ending to the series.<br /><br />Many other reviewers have argued that those disappointed with mockingjay were looking for a fairy tail ending. This is a shortsighted critique of those who didn't like the book.  I appreciated Collins' attempt to show the realities of war, but she used the same plot line to demonstrate the horrors again, and again, and again.  The entire book could be summarized into \\"Katniss is depressed, Katniss tries to become the mockingjay, Katniss gets inured, Katniss wakes up in a hospital in a cloudy haze.\\"  By the fourth or fifth reiteration I was so bored by this plot line that I no longer cared about any overarching message.<br /><br />Collins also packed the book with too many story lines and characters.  Many of the character's outcomes were simply forgotten or resolved in a few short sentences. Additionally there were so many undeveloped characters and plot lines that I constantly had to flip back through the book to figure out who they were speaking with and where the characters were in the story line.<br /><br />The book also never took the time to show how Katniss and Peeta were eventually able to move on from what they had experienced.  It seems much easier to spend over 300 pages breaking down these character's emotional stability, but Collins didn't tackle the harder side of that story to show how someone can cope with what they've experienced.  Instead she tries to explain the character's will to live in a short epilogue that was too little too late.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book and I appreciate what Collins tried to do, unfortunately she does not seem to be a skilled enough author to accomplish such a profound message.
B001DHXT1G|5.0|The 2003 movie Hulk was a disappointment.  This film, The Incredible Hulk, was well-made, action-filled, entertaining.  Even though I have nothing against the actors in the first film, ALL of the lead roles had stronger actors who showed more emotion in this one.  I'm really bummed that Edward Norton isn't playing the Hulk in the Avengers!
B000NTPDSW|3.0|The quality of the BDs is good and exactly what I expected.<br />What is a big disapointment though is the package quality. After opening, the paper box dismantled itself. The glue that sticks the parts of the box together was there, but it didn't mean much.<br />Part of the package is a booklet. But it is slightly bigger, so you cannot put it back inside.<br /><br />In overall - Such a quality product deserves better packaging. They killed it for me with that.
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|I was never a Thor fan; the only superhero comics I read growing up were Superman ones.  But I was curious about and wanted to see the movie when it came out.  I loved this movie!  I saw it 3 times:  once by myself, once with my 24 yr. old daughter, and then with my husband, who finally decided to give it a try and loved it, too!  Chris Hemsworth was the perfect actor to play the lead.  Besides being very good-looking, he is talented and easily portrayed the different emotions needed:  arrogance, strength, fierceness, humility.  I'm so glad to hear there's going to be a sequel!  In the meantime, I'll enjoy the character of Thor in the upcoming Avengers movie.

1400069289|2.0|I had high hopes for this book; understanding the neuroscience behind habit formation has obvious life changing potential. Helping you form good habits, breaking out of bad ones, gaining some self-awareness.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after a promising start the book quickly veers sharply off topic and starts exploring a host of concepts that are, if at all, only very tangentially related to neuroscience or indeed \\"habits\\". Habits of organizations? of societies?<br /><br />I decided to bear with it, hoping for everything to eventually come together.. but it never did. One is left suspecting that the author simply needed to find more material to fill the pages of his book and had to grasp at straws.<br /><br />Then of course, there's the tone of the book. Some people may like the patronizing show-them-don't-tell-them narrative about successful sports coaches (everybody loves sports!), heart-warming anecdotes, heroic corporate turn-arounds, etc. Not me though.<br /><br />I found that the constant stream of anecdotes obscured the main points that the author was trying to make.. to the extend that I'm not sure there actually were any.<br /><br />The best thing about this book is probably that it will inspire somebody else to write a more tightly focused, less anecdotal and altogether more serious book about how habits are formed and how we may apply those insights.<br /><br />That's what the book is lacking: insights.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Got this as free app of the  and it is an outstanding game.Very addictive and challenging.Highly recommended, and well worth the price!

B000002HPT|4.0|Quoted from Lifting Shadows, DT's Authorized biography; Chapter 10, p.186-188<br /><br />Previously, the label had allowed Dream Theater a reasonable degree of flexibility but pressure was being exerted on their A&R mand Derek Oliver to encourage them to write more concise, commercial tracks that could be sold to radio. Consequently, although they were creating songs at a frantic pace, they constantly had to endure the ignominiy of having their carefully crafted demos repeatedly rejected by the record label moguls. It was a wearisome period of unceratinty that would last for almost a year, and left the band questioning how they were going to escape from such a debiilitating cycle.<br /><br />\\"By now, East West Records had been folded into the Elecktra label and instead of corporate pressure dissipating it became even more intense,\\" explains Derek Oliver. \\"Sylvia Rhone had become the president of Elecktra and was now overseeing a huge roster, and was faced with tremendous finanial overheads. Her focus had switched from the hard rock mainstays of the Atco/East West roster to the urban, eclectic and alternative acts that came with Elecktra. In my opninion, she would have dearly loved to have dropped Dream Theater, and we did in faact have discussions about transferring the contract to Warner Interantional. But she was attracted to the band's overesas success in Japan and Europe, and that prompted her to keep them on the label. However, she was clear that this time around they should come up with some shorter, snappier tracks so that radio could get behind the band again.\\"<br /><br />From the label's perspective, the release of a punchy single could, given the right ariplay, provide them with the perfect advert for the album and logically, it would have a positive affect on sales. But crucially, they were missing the point. Dream Theater have never been a band for whom the single format was a natural medium, and \\"Pull Me Under\\" was a result of fortunate timing and shrewd editing. And although that was something Derek Oliver doubtless understood, he was under the strictest of instructions to ensure that commerciality was at the forefront of the band's mind as they toiled away in the studio. The trick for the band was to write songs that were deemed to be acceptable to the mainstream but which didn't overly dilute their identity. But rejection of their work was not a reaction that Dream Theater had previously experienced, and when the likes of \\"Raise The Knife\\" and \\"Where Are You Now\\" were presented to Oliver in March of 1996, they recieved a somewhat muted response.<br /><br />\\"That was weird,\\" Laughs John Petrucci. \\"I can just remember writing all this stuff, demoing it and being totally psyched. And I'd then go in and play it for Derek and he'd say 'Yeah. I really don't think there's anything there.' And I'd be like 'What are you talking about?' I'd never really had a response like that before. I remember going back to the studio, being alll pissed, and then having to go back to start writing songs again.\\"<br /><br />\\"We would write a whole bunch of songs, like 'Lines In The Sand', 'Trial Of Tears' and 'Just Let Me Breathe' that felt like Dream Theater and we'd hand them in.\\" adds Mike. \\"Derek would play it for a few people and there would just be no reaction. He was fighting all the other people at the label as well and it was tough for him. So they would ask for something more commercial, as they basically still had that 'Pull Me Under' mentality. Then we would go off and write something more accessible like 'Hollow Years' or 'You Or Me' and those were the ones that got them excited. They were just looking for singles. I mean, we started writing 'Metropolis Part II' during 1996 as we were finally going to write the sequel. It ended up being this twenty-minute epic, and again that got no reaction from the label. We'd write two or three songs, demo them and then hand them in the new batch every couple of months.<br /><br />\\"But it was always a case of back to the drawing board. That is a horrible way for a band to write music - just trying to please a suit-and-tie executive that is going to completely determine the fate of the band. It's absolutely ludicrous that one guy's ridiculous taste was going to either catapult or bury a band. It's everything that is wrong about the industry, and why the whole period was so frustrating. We were so terribly disappionted with Derek Oliver's inability to stand behind us and to get us where we wanted to go without being consumed by the machine. Derek was telling us to write and write, and wanted us to go in a more commercial direction. John Petrucci was more willing to accept that kind of change, whereas I was still fighting against us changing just for other people.\\"<br /><br />For my part, purely on the musical side, I rate the songs like this;<br /><br />New Millenium-5/5 One of my favorite DT songs to date. The bass-heavy style is great. The changes are a bit abrupt, but they work.<br /><br />You Not Me-3/5 I have a hard time with this song because later on in the book DT explains that the song was lyrically re-written after the demo was submitted. As such, I don't think it's really a DT song so much as it's what a record label thought a DT song should be. Despite all that, I still enjoy it.<br /><br />Peruvian Skies-4/5 The influence of Pink Floyd is very clear at the start of this. It's also one of their earlier 'soft' efforts and it works well. Especially the live version where they break into 'Enter Sandman' for a few bars, then go back to their riff and finish it out. Little nods to their influences like that endear me to the band.<br /><br />Hollow Years-2/5 This was where the studio really got to them. I can't really enjoy this song unless I hear the Budokan performance. It's just too light and wispy to be DT. The lyrics are very good, some of my favorite, but it could have been so much....more.<br /><br />Burning My Soul-4/5 The only thing Ihave against this song, and it's a minor thing at that...the chorus is just too repetitive. Some DT songs barely have the title in the lyrics (several don't have any lyrics at all) yet this one beats you over the head with the song title. Obvious label influence there unfortunately, as DT never ever ever tried that trick again.<br /><br />Hell's Kitchen-5/5 This is my favorite DT instrumental ever. My only wish is that it were longer. Even at that it ends on the same note that Dance Of Eternity begins with from Metropolis Pt. II. I just love how it starts and just builds beautifully unitl it peaks at exactly the right point at the end. Masterpeice.<br /><br />Lines In The Sand-5/5 Most of the time I try to think of Hell's Kitchen as the intro to Lines, but the two are just too different. However, the remedy is in the capable hands of Derek Sherinian via an amazing solo. The high notes of the chorus can seem a bit forced, but James hits everything solidly enough to bring it together. The drums also stand out nicely as I think Mike did some of his best creative work here.<br /><br />Take Away My Pain-5/5 Another of my favorite DT songs of all time. It shows that not only can DT make a subdued song work well (they did it before in Images and Words as well as Awake so nothing new, but good to see nonetheless) but it can also be a very emotionally charged moment. When you understand it was written about the passing of John Petrucci's father, the live version in Paris is simply astounding.<br /><br />Anna Lee-3/5 Possibly one of DT's more underrated songs, I like it a lot, but there's just something odd about the sound of the guitar. After James builds up this amazing crecendo (<--spelling?) The guitar solo just doesn't quite seem to fit the energy it's given. Maybe the drums could have added more. I dunno, it just seems that the song looses momentum too quickly toward the end, though the end itself is very nice.<br /><br />Trial Of Tears-5/5 This one I think snuck by thelabel, all things considered. I can't really think about anything in the song that I question or dislike.<br /><br />My review of the album with full consideration given to the situation in which it was created is that this is absolutely a DT album, no 'sellout' tag is appicable. Watch the Score DVD and listen to 'Raise The Knife' and understand that it would have been on the album had the atmosphere been better for DT's style of music. I can understand that some of it doesn't really play to the more expected DT material evenly, but it isn't garbage by any stretch of the imagination.
B002VE0VYS|3.0|Most of these songs have been played to death and quite honestly sound better in original recordings. But the one true hidden gem on this album is the Robert Johnson cover Love In Vain. For me its one of those songs you can play over and over a hundred times and get something new from it each time. This sounds absolutely amazing in a quiet room or car and the volume turned up. My recommendation is to buy the single and skip the album.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|So far it's been fun. There are a lot of games to choose from. Some are kind of difficult and a little cheesey but my kids really like them too.

B004UXUUDA|5.0|I read this book before I watched the dvd and thought that it represented the book very well, it followed it quite closely. Sometimes it is disappointing when liberties are taken with a movie and the ending or facts have been changed from the storyline of the book but this was not the case with this movie. I enjoyed both the book and the movie.

B001S86J1C|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Funny storyline. Guaranteed to make you laugh. Mathew Brodrick was great as well as the supporting cast.  At a time when movies seem to be filled with too much violence, too much profanity, and too much sex, this movie (despite its age) is truly a breath of fresh air. The plot of several high school kids trying to outsmart their principal is hilarious.  If you and your family are looking for an evening of entertainment, I recommend this movie 100%.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its fun and works great on my kindle fire.  the only thing I don't like is the in app purchasing. but its fun
B005GFPZYK|1.0|I was hoping for an introspective and interesting first-person account of modern insurgent warfare and what I got was an extremely rough-hewn account from an very unlikable individual.  Yes, I am proud that he fought for our country, but his inability to avoid fights in bars, carry a chip on his shoulder, anger at any and all authority, and otherwise boorish behavior took almost all of my interest in his story.<br /><br />Thumbs down.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is very good, I play it when I don't want to play a too intense battery consuming game. this game is like Mario but with a fun twist which works out great. good job!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I had heard alot of \\"gossip\\" about the book so I just had to see the hype of the book. I did not know what the book was really about. I found it a pleaseant suprise in the writing and the story itself. It shows you that people have demons but with love, respect, hard work, and patience you can work thru the demons. I read the book so fast I couldnt put it down...
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|despite alerts about renewed energy and grown crops, the game goes back to when I last left it. no energy, and everything I'm supposed to gain from says I can collect in 30 hours. I've uninstalled and reinstalled. same problems.

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|super fun game! only negative is that it uses an energy meter so you have to stop playing and come back a couple of hours later.<br />Edit:  It eventually quit working on my Kindle Fire and I just deleted the game entirely.  :(  Fun while it lasted though.

B001EC2ISA|5.0|We've loved Beetle Juice forever, and we still swear that we passed the house on a camping trip outside of Freeport, Maine.  We got a new DVD/ Blue Ray player from the kids for Christmas, so it was a choice I thought we'd all enjoy.

B005J4TLN4|5.0|Going into the movie I expected to hate it to bits, lets be honest the movie really didn't look that great due to the trailers, but to my surprise I ended up loving it. It's your basic alien invasion movie with a twist, inner city kids kill an alien, more aliens come down to kill them, inner city kids fight the aliens, it's simple but it works. The characters were pretty much all likable,even though some do overact. The alien designs, while simple, are really good. Their entire bodies are black which allows them to hide in the darkness which creates paranoia since they blend in so well with the darkness of night, the only thing you will ever see of them are their glowing mouths when they go to take a bite out of you. The location is brilliant, it looks very nice. To me this is very fun and well made sci-fi film, weird because it's classified as Action/Adventure, and if your up for a fun time go rent it and see what you think.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|With all the crazy press this series has been getting lately not the mention the focus it's getting from folks on Goodreads, I finally decided I had to read it.<br /><br />The Fifty shades series consists of three books:<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey<br />Fifty Shades Darker<br />Fifty Shades of Freed<br /><br />What can I say about these books? First of all, they are some of the naughtiest novels I've ever read. They blow even the Black Dagger Brotherhood series out of the water in terms of graphic, detailed sex scenes. And we're not talking romantic vanilla sex here either - it's hot and heavy with heavy S&M undertones (or just flat out blatant S&M scenes depending on the book). It's this graphic, naughty content that has garnered all of the press, attention, and even movie deals for a series that is otherwise fairly unremarkable.<br /><br />Basically Fifty Shades is a S&M Cinderella story. At the start of the story Anastasia Steele is a student, wrangled into doing an interview for her college newspaper with Christian Grey, a local tycoon. As you might imagine, in a story like this one, the tycoon is not only ridiculously wealthy, he also happens to be young, incredibly handsome, and dashing. Oh, and let's not forget, a 100% grade-A alpha-male. Yum! Anastasia manages to completely botch the interview, but somehow catches Christian's attention. He's determined to possess her in every way.<br /><br />Now this is probably an ideal point to mention Anastasia is an attractive, intelligent woman in her early-twenties, but is remarkably still a virgin. But Christian approaches her with a proposition no virgin could refuse (err... not?): Agree to sign a contract making her his love slave (and I mean slave in the literal sense), and she can have him. What girl could refuse that, right?<br /><br />Okay, so I'm kind of mocking a bit here. I actually enjoyed this book, and Christian's approach is less creepy and more alpha-male sexy in the novel. It's just a strange premise. Fortunately Anastasia agrees with me on the oddity of Christian's approach. She's actually a fairly smart girl, and I liked her character quite a bit. I'm not spoiling too much to say she accepts his offer (with serious reservations and restrictions)and what follows is a rags to riches story where an innocent girl exchanges a life of chastity and poverty for one of riches and debauchery. Underneath the Cinderella theme, this is also a story about healing. As Anastasia and Christian explore the world of \\"kinkey f***ery,\\" the author uses sex to slowly pull back the layers that make up Christian. We learn about his extremely messed up past, and his pain, and slowly come to fall in love with him right along with Anastasia.<br /><br />As the story moves on, the sex does not decrease, but the blatant S&M content does. There are stalkers, crazy ex's galore to spice up the story and add intrigue. The entire series is really very exciting, VERY sexual, and interesting.<br /><br />So why the three star rating, you ask? Well, despite the fact I enjoyed the series, the writing quality was very poor (and doesn't improve as the series goes on). There is an excessive use of repetitive language - mostly in Anastasia's inner dialog and actions - that drove me a bit batty (how many times CAN a girl bit her lip without seriously chapping them? Gah). AND, for some reason I will never understand, the author gave Anastasia some sort of split personality disorder. Living inside her head are three distinctive personalities: Anastasia's normal inner voice, her inner goddess (who happens to love wearing sequins, and doing cartwheels), and her conscious (who wears spectacles, reads classic literature, and glares a lot). It seems every other chapter we're forced to endure descriptions about what Anastasia's inner goddess is doing (and how much her conscious disapproves). These inner voices (...multiple personalities) don't even remain consistent. For the most part the inner goddess approvesof anything involving sex. However, she's sometimes a voice of empowerment, encouraging Anastasia to stand up for herself and claim her rights as a woman, other times she's encouraging actions that are blatantly degrading. By the middle of book 2, I swore I'd scream and stop reading the book if I read one more mention of Anastasia's inner goddess. But I'm a weak woman. Despite my resolve, I didn't scream (much), and I kept reading.<br /><br />The Fifty Shades series is a little like black tar heroin. You KNOW it's bad for you, sometimes you don't even know why you keep reading it, but you can't stop yourself from coming back for more. It's a exciting, hot, and seriously sexy story that will keep you turning the pages long into the night. If you are in the mood for something naughty and fun, and are willing to put up with some writing issues, then look no further.of anything involving sex.

B00782O7IY|5.0|Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, John Gilbert, Rudolph Valentino and Douglas Fairbanks are smiling. This audacious film is a silent movie in black and white, with intertitles for dialogue! This PG-13 homage to early Hollywood absolutely proves that Talkies did NOT invent drama, pathos, comedy or romance; we experience all of these and more, yet only hear a handful of words spoken in the entire film. (I just love movies about movies!)<br /><br />Did you see the \\"OSS 117\\" pastiches inspired by the \\"James Bond\\" films? If so, you can easily picture the hilarious Jean Dujardin as a 1920s silent screen superstar who goes into a tailspin with the advent of the Talkies. Dujardin is a master of the sendup, the spoof, the satirical take-off on vanity, ego and self-satisfaction, so his parody of Douglas Fairbanks is spot on! As are his versions of Gene Kelly in \\"Singin' in the Rain,\\" and Fred Astaire in anything with Ginger Rogers.<br /><br />In a second viewing, I was even more impressed, look for long single-take scenes: note the one in the star's dressing room when the starlet finds herself alone; watch the lengthy dance sequence a la Astaire, two cuts, MAX! Note the \\"Hollywoodland\\" sign on the hillside. That was the original Hollywood sign, it was a real estate advertisement and that was when I knew they would try for verisimilitude. I've ordered the DVD from Amazon.com because this can hold up under repeated viewings. In the 84th Annual Academy Awards (in which it won numerous awards) it was revealed that of all the nominated films, this is the only one SHOT ENTIRELY IN THE HOLLYWOOD AREA!<br /><br />These actors make it work:<br />  * Jean Dujardin won the Best Actor award at Cannes for this role. He starts out as such a \\"STAR\\" that you are surprised when you see a more human side.<br />  * Bérénice Bejo is transcendent as a spunky Debbie Reynolds-type character in this little show-biz romp. Of course they meet cute and then, shades of \\"A Star is Born,\\" their lives reverse as her fortunes soar and his plummet.<br />  * A clever Jack Russell Terrier promptly keels over when a finger is suddenly pointed at him, but runs for help when the house is on fire.<br />  * Penelope Ann Miller is our hero's disenchanted wife.<br />  * John Goodman with cigar at full chomp, runs a studio and caters to temperamental stars.<br />  * James Cromwell is our hero's faithful chauffeur and stalwart friend.<br />  * Missi Pyle does a blonde bimbo reminiscent of Lina Lamont in \\"Singin'...,\\" only we never hear this one's voice... Whew!<br /><br />Writer/Director Michel Hazanavicius has done only French films in the past, but with printed dialogue on those intertitles, this film could be in any language. (Please remember, both \\"homage\\" and \\"cliché\\" are French!) Our Seattle International Film Festival screening audience could see that most of the words the actors mouthed were English...except that terrific dog...I'm pretty sure he was barking in French.

B003Y5HWK4|5.0|NOTE:  I was wondering why this show didn't have a five-star, because of faulty DVDs.<br /><br />I bought my set for $40 and bought it on a fling that Steve Buscemi was the main character in it, and from the very first episode I was thrown into Atlantic City.  This has to be the best show I have ever watched next to Dexter.  The 1920's atmosphere is very apparent and the show doesn't force this atmosphere on you.  ALL the characters are dynamic in their own way.  Noche (Steve) Thompson being the kind-hearted, yet dark aperture of crime in Atlantic City.  His character is the most intriguing next to Jimmy, a young man returning mentally and physically scarred from France during The First World War.  Al Capone makes more than a cameo as joking lackey of the Chicago gang (forgot name, if there was one).  More and more and more characters that you'd expect from a big budget HBO series...  Every episode of the 12 (730 minutes, 12 hours, 2 min intro, 2 min credits) are just as memorable as the last and plots and story lines twists together on the show's road to its series finale.  It kind of copies Godfather (Part I) in its series finale and it's very satisfying, and kind of makes sense with Martin Scorsese as one of the producers...<br /><br />I bought the blu-ray set.  If you buy the DVD's, fine.  If you have a large HD television and you buy the DVD, you need to stop wasting money.  This is one of the best looking Blu-rays I have ever watched (compared to Avatar, Terminator: Salvation, and [American] Girl With The Dragon Tattoo).  The color on their suites are defined in ways only demos in the department stores can make them shine.  A bright and inviting presentation that can leave you immersed in the grittiness of the portrayed Atlantic City.  Can't really comment on sound to give audiophiles are well deserved review on it, but I listened to it on high volumes at times (5.1 Dolby Surround Sound) and the ambient noise of the 1920's was as apparent and satisfying, I recommend high volume play.  What do you expect, it's top notch.<br /><br />If you like any gangster movie, get this one!  Politics were the first gangsters, and Noche Thompson sits high on the list.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Very good weather app. Runs in the background consuming very little resources. It is very really accessible and presents the weather information in a convenient and innovative format.
B0055SWM08|5.0|great game, graphics and music.  it is well built and easy to use.  the puzzles are challenging, especially as you progress, but not impossible.
B004I744AS|5.0|A wonderful app! If you interested in current events, learning new words, and historical events. I suggest you review for yourself; it's FREE!
B006R1T40I|5.0|I've been a follower of Bonnie since the 70's.  This is fast becoming my favorite!  She knocks this one out of the ballpark!  Can't wait to see her in May in ATL.  You rock girl!
B0059XTUVI|4.0|The Iron Lady depicts Margaret Roberts Thatcher's life from the 40's to present day, to early election as an MP for the conservative party to sparring with the boys as  PM to her exit from 10 Downing street to her family life and social engagements. Many reviews are calling this work \\"Masterful by Streep, but where is the film, the plot?\\" I think the film is depicting truth; as difficult as some scenes are to watch one of the main tenets of a film is to tell the truth. This tenet has been caputured in MThatcher's idiosyncracies, philosophy, values, presence and aging process by Streep.<br /><br />The title of the film is symbolic of her time in office and is appropriate.  It can also be attributed to her life and struggle before entering parliament and when leaving as it does take strength to go it alone in the face of obvious ailments. I loved Streep's dialogue, accent, mannerisms as MT. That alone was worth the ticket. Lets be reminded of the fact that now and again film does provide entertainment but primarily it is directed to reflect the truth, in history and persona. The Iron Lady accomplished that, both literally and figuratively. I also thought the parliament debates were streaming with authenticity. Thatcher is a global role model for women.
B0000027RL|5.0|The grunge years of rock n roll in the 90's were not something that I look back on very fondly.  With a few exceptions I found it hard to get into the majority of bands that came out of this scene.  One of those exceptions however was Pearl Jam.  Pearl Jam owed as much to classic rock as they did to grunge and to me \\"Ten\\" is one of the best all around rock albums to be released in the 90's.  The album produced a slew of rock radio hits, all of which are strong.  The rest of the album also brims with life and I personally don't think there is a clunker in the bunch.  Yes, a lot of grunge purists considered Pearl Jam not to be truly part of their movement which may be an accurate assessment, but to me that is not a negative.  I have had mixed feelings about some of Pearl Jam's other albums finding some great and some not so good, but \\"Ten\\" truly is a classic of its era and deserves the accolades it has received over the years.
B0077DBZXO|5.0|I like the part where they go up the beanstalks and their voices sound all high pitched and stuff.Humpty sounds like an egg elf.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I have read many,  many books in my 60 + years....I was an English teacher.  This book was more \\"smut\\" than anything else.  I think it belittles the intelligence of young women.  Would not recommend it.
B004OZOTSQ|2.0|I was hoping this app would provide an interface similar to using windows explorer over a USB cable (albeit using a browser and wifi). Unfortunately there is no way to autodiscover the phone, so you have to enter the ip address and port in the browser. Then the program claims the ability to upload entire directories, which I was interested since I listen to a lot of audiobooks that are in their own directory. It turns out you have to zip the directory, upload it and unzip it on the phone. that's still too awkward. For now I'll stick to using a cable, it's 1000% more convenient than dealing wih the limitation of the interface over a browser for the sake of being wireless.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is asimple game that passes time.it is fun for kids n adults...does fine on the fire..kids think of it like mario.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|this is a lot like Mario but not as easy to control for kids. If you like Mario you'll like this.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought the book because the movie trailers on tv looked like something I would be interested in. The book was better than I thought it would be. The characters are well rounded and interesting. I never knew what to expect. It made me think long after I finished the book, about how choices have consequences.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I needed an adapter for my Cisco console cable, as my computer(s) did not have a db9 port. This serial adapter works great, simply install the drivers, then plug in the adapter and you are ready to go!<br /><br />This is working out great with my CCNA lab at home, highly recommended!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Waste of time.. wish I could return it. Straight porn, and not even good porn. Naive girl. So much to say about it but why bother when everyone has said it already.. would be happy if the stars went down on it until it was rated at \\"crap.\\"
B005HWUCMC|4.0|i think this album was one of Rihanna's absolute best - almost all of the songs are fantastic if not mega-hits. HOWEVER - although even the 'Clean' version does edit out profanity, it must be noted the majority of the songs on this album feature adult content and lyrics. parents of young children, please review the lyrics before purchasing!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Love this fun game. Keep the levels coming. A lot like Super Mario brothers. Thanks for making this awesome free game. Great on Kindle Fire
B007TNS6JI|1.0|Usually when you develop a sequel, it's based on the one before it but with improvements and a storyline continuation. There's none of that here: it's an entirely new gameplay model that has nothing to do with dungeon hunting. Fans of Arena Mode games may like this new format, but if you're looking for the classic hack-n-slash gameplay seen with the first two, then you should look elsewhere.
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|This Firewire was the FIRE-WIRE that I was looking for in so many Stores in Los Angeles,<br />Thank God I was able to fine it at Amazon.com it works perfect for my MacBook Pro 15'' Laptop I love it.<br />Thank you Amazon.com for your Care and Support ;-)<br /><br />Ulysses Chinchilla
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is no masterpiece but once you start you cannot stop reading and when finished have to buy the 2nd then 3 rd installment.<br />Sometimes repetitive but still sucks you in with the many erotic passages, will make your husband very happy that you are reading it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|makes you review to keep playing. silly but yet I am doing it so game must be worthwhile. Mario if he was a leprechaub
B007PKOKTK|4.0|So funny and fun to watch, it will be a tradition for us. The characters are hilarious and very appropriate for my 8 year old son.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a great free game that both my daughter and I enjoy playing.  I definitely recommend it for the kindle.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book was so addicting! I've been staying up until 2:30 in the morning just to finish it once my kids go to bed! The love story is fantastic, makes me smile and laugh out loud sometimes.<br /><br />They seriously seriously needed to run it through an editors office before publishing because there are SO many typing mistakes and sentences that make you re-read them and make you wonder wth. But, that's tolerable since the book is so good.
0439023513|4.0|I'm in the minority here as I thought the first book was just okay.  I wasn't sure what all the fuss was about - either good or bad, I just thought it was okay.  I really liked the second book and Mockingjay was a refreshing end from so many possible endings.  Having said that, since I did read these back to back (bought the trilogy for Kindle), it was a little monotnous getting through the summaries the author puts in so I confess to skimming parts.  I also think all three books were written as a movie with the movie(s) potentially being better (the costumes, the scenery, the action!).  And while all the scripted video taping was getting on my nerves throughout Mockingjay, I liked how everything played out.<br /><br />You're in for some twists that you may or may not see coming, they just kind of nag at the back of your head while reading.  You're in for heartbreak (as all good war stories bring) but you're also in for closure.  Those readers not seeing that closure between the characters need to reread how the final chapters went down.  Maybe this isn't a \\"warm and fuzzy\\" kind of book, but what can you expect when the plot of the original is teenagers being made to fight to the death.<br /><br />I hope others enjoy this series in its entirety and not try to judge each book alone - I really feel the three are meant to be read as one.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|We anticipated seeing this movie and hoped to see some of the great things this powerful and couragous woman had done for the sake of freedom and liberty.  Instead the movie totally distroyed her and her legacy.  This is an unfair portrail of one of the world's great individuals - we deserve more.
B005ZMV2EQ|5.0|This is a very good DVD story for a child who is between 6 and 10 years oldas well as for adults
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Dont read a lot of Zombie novels.  This was so good that I read a number of apocolypse and zombie novels after world war Z.  This was the best of the lot.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|fun and enjoyable. great way to pass the time. puzzles ae challenging, but not impossibe. would recommend to anyone and to all
B0073PPNE8|5.0|I was happy with my order. The video loaded quickly and the quality was good. I would recommend this movie
B004SBQGHS|5.0|this game so much fun and addictive. it takes a lot of will power to give it up.GREAT GAME. GREAT GAME
B005UPOAT2|5.0|I love this movie and was excited to buy it on blu ray. The picture and audio look/ sound good and the price was definitely reasonable. I would recommend this blu ray.
0316017930|5.0|I had to read this book for a class assignment. I found it to be very interesting and insightful. This is the first Gladwell book that I have read but I think I will read his others. I experienced several \\"aha\\" moments while reading it. Gladwell explains things in such a way that you think to yourself, why didn't I think of that? Easy quick read.
B0063IH60K|4.0|solitaire is a good game, but this version has a possibility to play the games that other people had won. this screams easy to me. I think that this game would be much more fun if it had levels of difficulty.
B000FC2ROU|4.0|This book is a real page turner, kept me thinking about what had happened and how it figured into what happens next. the down fall was the last few chapters- became too over the top for most.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good game. I like the fact that you can finish any quest so far that I have done anyways without having to get outside help. also cute story line.
B0055SWM08|5.0|good time waster. levels get challenging too. the hints are useful on those brain bending levels. I can see playing this until I beat it instead of dropping it from boredom.
B0063IH60K|5.0|App works great on my Droid 4.  graphics look and work really well.  For solitaire, has plenty of play and display options.
B001974DG0|5.0|This is my favorite Koontz novel.  I've read it at lest two dozen times in paperback and now it's on my Kindle.  The story is a bit far-fetched but will hook you right in.  You will keep rooting for the underdog and Superdog.  Once you've read it, don't you dream of having an Einstein of your own?! :)
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|It's a fun ahem where u can learn so much but u can't get dollars without buying them and sometimes the game acts really slow. it could also be very educational!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This trilogy just gets better! I did not see half of the stuff happening that did happen in this book and I couldn't believe the injustices that happened to these kids. I can't wait to read the third and final book to see how this series ends!
B0055PGUYU|4.0|This book was intriguing. Although I am familiar with many of the featured concepts,  related details were presented with a fresh spin and interesting details. This book is very good but not absolutely exceptional; hence, the rating.
0375714839|5.0|This is an account of a small girl's childhood lost to the greater political machinations of her time.  To a person who grew up watching the US embassy hostage crisis unfold every night on television, this puts a human face on what was occurring behind the cameras between  friends and family members on the ground in Tehran.
0439023513|2.0|*Spoilers*<br />I enjoyed the first two books; especially the first.  With the third though, it really was all over the place.  Trying to do way too much in a single short book with pacing better suited for the arena only.  Some things that I though were pretty weird (out of many):<br /><br />The people escaping by the lake to District 13.  We have this whole ordeal about meeting them, finding out about the districts, how they survived, sharing food and on and on.  Later we mark the plot check box. Verdict: Apparently they didn't make it. What a waste of pages.<br /><br />The love triangle with Peeta and Gale was closed off very poorly.  I wouldn't care if she ended up with Gale, Peeta, no one or one of the camera guys but, can we find out why please?  Instead, Peeta magically gets back in love, right after starting to see all the flaws with Kat.  Gale just is gone working somewhere.  No need for more info apparently.<br /><br />The whole bomb the children thing did not work in so many ways.  It makes my head hurt how forced that was.<br /><br />I realize to some this is the best book in the world.  My guess is that the long term average will be 3.5 stars at best.
B000I9TY4G|5.0|I really like this movie so now i can stream it whem ever i want on my laptop or tablet. cant wait to find some other movie i want.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its really entertaining!!! I love it its so fun and its pretty addictive haha. All of ky friends went and got it too lol
B0060V1WJ6|2.0|The main reason I watched this was because of Ryan Gosling...he is such a good actor and appealing. He's fabulous...Emma Stone and Julian Moore, are great, too. Steve Carrell -- I have tried to really like him for such a long time and I find him not appealing at all. There's nothing about him that excites me. He has no sex appeal. Period. His success mystifies me. As a womanizer he is unbelievable. There are so many unbelievable moments in this film. Unconvincing moments when you can imagine the actors cringing at what they're doing. Melissa Tome has a ridiculous role, way beneath her. How did anyone get these good actors to make this film?<br />The script is uneven at best. The best scenes are with Gosling; he lights up the screen. The climax of the movie is embarrassing, so hokey, Steve Carrell delivers a speech, literally, about love to a gymnasium filled with high school kids and their parents. The speech is clunky, the relationships contrived in some cases. And Kevin Bacon, wow, why is he playing such a loser. He's so smart, that's the kind of character I like to see him play. This move is also very long. Ho hum.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The trilogy is awesome.  Couldn't stop until all were read.  May have been written for the young but at 65, I was totally smitten with the story and the ease and flow of the story.  Does not remind me of a world I can remember but one I can see in our future.  Congratulations.
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|With a cast like this you really can't miss. True, the story is unusual, about a past-time, birdwatching, which a lot of people think is a joke, boring, whatever. If you like these actors and if you have ever admired the beauty and wonder of birds, then you will get this movie. It's light-hearted and thoughtful at the same time, about competition and relationships, and also birds! By the end,  you might think, on the one hand, that the real winners are the ones with good relationships and the loser is the one who is alone with first place. However, another angle is that passion rules, passion for what you love, for whatever reason, that drives you, and that's okay, too.<br />I'll see this again.
B003FSTN5C|5.0|Awesome show and love to be able to watch the episodes from the season from start to finish.  Love it!
B000HBKCDC|2.0|I would like to start out saying that I'm a huge Sarah McLachlan fan.  My wife bought this for me for Christmas as a surprise.  I wanted to love the album but I just couldn't.  As beautiful as Sarah's voice is, and as much as I love her style of singing, it just didn't work for me with Christmas songs.  Most of the tracks sound the same and are delivered in such a somber tone that it just doesn't feel like Christmas music.  In my opinion this just doesn't live up to the quality of her work.  I would borrow the CD from your local library to preview it before buying it just to make sure it is your cup of tea.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a fun game. If you like Mario, then you will like this.<br />I really enjoy it. You go around smashing bricks,  collecting coins, etc.
B0053VKP8S|2.0|After reading all the great reviews I thought that this would solve my problem that this little device should have fixed.  I have a new Samsung TV and it doesn't have any RCA out. I thought I needed to purchase a NEW surround sound system that could connect to my TV, then I found this gadget.  I did some research and I feel everything is hooked up correctly, but all I hear is STATIC.  Maybe someone can help me out, not sure what the problem is...that's why just the 2 stars.  The build quality looks excellent and like the compact size, just doesn't work for me.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|It is totally sweet. I wish the makers of this game would come up with a virtual pet game involving dolphins though. It could be like all the story games the player could have a marine world. In it you would have to take of the animals, assign tasks for them, attract visitors, and decorate their living environment.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game. I play it everyday. sometimes I sneak away at work and play till my energy runs out. I wish I had more friends on it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is a fast easy read that gets you hooked within the first couple of<br />chapters. I recommend all three books in the series.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|The Adventures of Tintin is not only one of the best animated films I have seen in years it's one of the best films I have seen in years. I like the fact that they keep it real (no talking animals or breaking into song.) It had a good story line and kept you interested in what was going on and I liked the life lesson at the end never let failure defeat you (or something like that.) I can't wait for the next movie.<br /><br />I would recomend this for anyone nine years and older.
0307592731|5.0|I loved this book.  At times I laughed out loud, and other times I cried.  I could just picture the first time she put \\"monster\\" (her backpack) on in the motel --- and then could not stand up. It was written so well, and it was so funny.  When she described the last days of her mom's life, I was so moved.  I recently lost my mom.  Her writing was so vivid, I felt I was in the hospital room.<br /><br />I think the reader will gladly  go through the trials, adventures, disappointments & fears with Cheryl.  She is an excellent writer, and brings her words to life.<br /><br />She made some fundamental changes while hiking the PCT ----  she was honest about her fears, and proud of her accomplishments.  Read this fabulous book, then go and have your own adventure!
B000O8OTNC|2.0|I like the portability of the sharpener, but tried it and didnt get very good results. It could be my lack of knife sharpening experience.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love puzzle games. and this kept my interest. Only thing that Sufis is that when this game is on my Kindle does not shut off when I get pulled away.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|i really do enjoy this app. its a great time waster ecspecially for kids 11 like me<br /> !!!! now I'm just going to say ranbom things blabalasncbdjbfvchdjsj
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is great. Nice graphics, fun puzzles, very relaxing to play. The music adds to the mood of the game.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I like it other then you have to wait on energy...I like the challenges and you can also shot the animals. like you would the olden days I also remember it from when I was in school!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great puzzle game, challenging, fun, play at your own pace.  The app it simple and easy to use. Highly recommend.
B00006J9OT|5.0|To describe Diana Krall as an extremely talented pianist and vocalist is a grave understatement.  Talent is something that can be developed but not always recognized.  Diana shares her Gift with us.  Both musically and vocally, she is in an arena with only the most gifted musicians we've ever been graced with.  Honestly, how many have there been who could play the keys/strings/brass off their instrument, and then knock you out of your seat and hypnotize you with their vocals?  Precious few.  Stevie Wonder.  George Benson.  The voice of a sultry angel would be enough to do most of us in by itself.  Diana, I humbly thank you for sharing your gift.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|As an Englishman who voted for her and lived through these very trying times, I thought it was a very interesting perspective.  Remember in Britain many people hated her with a passion so it would be hard to do a film on Thatcher that was just a \\"celebration of what she did\\"  Many would not agree, although I would.<br /><br />So I think this is a subtle way of getting the story told so both those who admired her and hated her could watch a drama about an Amazing woman in very interesting times.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film and particularly remember the flash backs to what were very personal and engrained memories for me.  Merryl Streep does an excellent job and brings Thatcher to life.
B005G4TJUC|2.0|Pros: Beautiful babe. Over-the-top special effects. Cons: Unbelievable script. Horrible writing. Cheesy acting.<br />The review: I really like Sci-Fi, and have watched every Transformers movie hoping they will be good. So far none have been better than average, and this one is no exception. The special effects are cool, and the great looking girlfriend make this movie worth watching for the eye candy alone. Everything else was... not good. I would recommend saving your money and renting this from the library, because it is not worth a second look. I like my fiction to at least be believable. Bringing another planet into orbit right next to earth? Even if this was possible the gravitational pull would destroy both planets. The parts written for the actors were just plain bad. There was not one person in the movie I could relate to on any level. When the shuttle blew up I was actually hoping the Autobots really did die so they (hopefully) wouldn't make anymore Transformers movies. At that point in the movie I would have been happy to see the Decepticons win. That would have made for an interesting plot twist, instead of the predictable ending we were served up here. I am quite full now, you don't need to feed me anymore sub-standard movies.
0307352145|5.0|While I am not completely introverted, I am more introverted than extroverted. I found myself relating to so many of the ideas in this book. Susan Cain has done an excellent job illustrating how introverts not only adapt to a world that places significant value on the qualities of extroverts, but also how important a role the quiet person often plays in society. It not only helped me value those who are more introverted than me, but also better appreciate those who are more extroverted than me. Overall, an excellent read.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I like this game. I really truly do. The only thing that bugs me is that the controls are s little difficult to use for me. sometimes I accidentally take my hand off the right control and I have to restart.
B006IDG2T6|5.0|Neither You, I, or anybody else chose to have the physical characteristics or the environment we were born with, and certainly nobody chooses how to feel about anything, you and everybody else just feel what we feel depending on how our brain was formed and the experiences we had in our environment.<br /><br />Mr. Harris points at what should be obvious, if it wasn't so strongly against our wishful thinking and against our most beloved ideas about ourselves.<br />With a few sentences at the beginning of his book he states the idea in simple terms:  \\"if somebody has a brain tumor you understand if the conduct of that someone is affected, but if the structural differences are microscopical or biochemical\\" then you cannot understand how that affects everyone's decisions and behavior?
B005NKGEP2|2.0|Another by-the-numbers spy story that managed to consume an airline flight, but has little else to recommend it.  The writing style wore on me at 1/4 through.  The plot had nice elements that, in the hands of a better writer, could have amounted to something, but was simply not realized here.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|the only thing I don't like is the energy. but its still fun and it gives you something to do when your bored.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A very relaxing and well made puzzle game. I find myself playing this much longer than I should trying to get a perfect solution to each stage.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I luv it and I don't even mind tht its just another kind of Mario. I say everyone should try it!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this ap! I'm a Solitaire fan and love the options on this game. There is even a choice offered to play a winning hand. The cards move very easily and you can tilt your kindle fire or android either vertically or horizontally.  I highly recommend this FREE game ap.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game wuth lots of goals. this has a very good animation and effects. I would recommend it to anyone
0307956350|5.0|EXPATS gripped me from the first paragraph. Kate Moore is leaving her job as a concession for her husband's job transfer to Luxembourg. There she'll raise her sons with her husband Dexter, a securities analyst for a banking firm. Kate has a secret past, and decides against telling her husband what she really did for a living while they were stateside. She promised herself that she would never investigate her Dexter.<br />In Luxembourg, Kate meets Julia from Chicago and they become fast friends. It isn't long before Kate's internal alarms begin to sound and she checks into a few things that Julia had said, to find them untrue. Julia and her husband Bill don't seem to be quite a couple; and even though they pose as husband and wife, Kate isn't buying it. Suddenly, Kate is suspicious of both of them.<br />At home, Dexter blatantly withholds information from Kate, who is driven to insane levels of curiosity. Will she give break her own vow to herself and check up on him?<br /><br />I loved every moment in this story, each chapter ended in a cliff hanger. Like putting together an intricate puzzle, EXPATS had me guessing at every turn, then suddenly, the entire picture emerged. Chris Pavone writes masterfully and more than once I found myself holding my breath waiting to see what would happen next. I will be searching for the next one in what promises to be an engaging series.<br />Definitely a must read.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is anvery fun game and I suggest many younger kids should play it because it's fillednwith fun and laughter! :)
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great  gameplay with calm, soothing sounds and visuals.  Addictive and challenging, it's easy to find yourself completely absorbed in this beautiful puzzler.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game! Closest thing to Mario, which I love! You wont regret getting this. I'm surprised its free!
B005LAIGWS|1.0|This movie was a joke.  I thought the first was very entertaining.  Dont be fooled, I actually almost walked out of the theater.
B004I744AS|4.0|A decent app - no complaints, but hard to rave over. As good or better than other similar apps. I recommend it.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|A true Christmas classic by Charles Dickens that can be read anytime of the year. True it's best during the holiday season, but I have read it during other times of the year.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|The only issue I have is the graphics on a couple of the tile sets are difficult to distinguish. Of course it could be that I need better glasses!
B0055SWM08|4.0|I can't say that I'm addicted but I do enjoy playing the game. I must admit that some of the puzzles are really difficult for me.
B0055SWM08|5.0|l love playing quell...lots of fun!!!  It makes you use your mind and challenges you to see how well you can think.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a great game. I really enjoy it on my down time at work. just really wish I didn't run out of energy so quickly....
1845767055|5.0|Hi Folks. Thanks for all your kind comments. Much appreciated - really. I,ve pushed it along, and the book should be in print again very soon. Maybe May.Thanks again, and all the best, Paul Bonner
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|i can't stop playing this is a very entertaining game. I cant wait to invite my friends to join in on the fun have fun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|At first I was skeptical on whether or not I would enjoy such a fantasy thriller novel like The Hunger Games, but immediately after I started reading it I was hooked. The story was so capitivating, with lots of twisted and turns centered around the games and romance that keeps you on edge, wanting more until the very end. The author also included a lot of emotion into the story as well, allowing readers to really feel for the characters involved in the deadly Hunger Games, while at the same time making everyone who reads think about pressing issues, like government, poverty and power. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for something new, thriller seeking and exciting to read that is out of the normal selection.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|please do a sale and I will get it it has to be good it's from gameloft and I have played gangstar Miami vindication
B00006GA4C|5.0|This album is great, it reminds me of a top notch garage band with all the bells and whistles. Later they got a lot more polish added to them, it is what it is so just enjoy it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game and highly recommend this to someone who likes games I luv this games. 101 in 1 games +23
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app consists of fun little games.  Some are VERY easy and some are a bit more difficult.  And I haven't even gotten into the locked ones yet.  I'm looking forward to that!
B003K16P50|5.0|Excellent. Enjoyable. Witty. Fun and thought provoking. I'm glad I read it before seeing the film. I will look forward to seeing the changes the filmmakers include. But the book was a good read. Visually inspiring and excellent use of the mind's eye.
B002DZX958|5.0|Yeah, sure - as is nearly always the case with complete cycles such as this one, you could probably find better, 'hotter' performances of nearly all of these works. Even when we narrow our focus on to the Chicago Symphony itself, Fritz Reiner set the standard for Bartok's \\"Concerto for Orchestra\\" and \\"Music for Strings, Percussion and Celeste\\". But what about the \\"Miraculous Mandarin\\", \\"Wooden Prince\\", or the three wonderful piano concertos of Bartok? As a complete set, Boulez would be awfully tough to beat by any standard.<br /><br />Yeah, I suppose if Philips were to box up all of Ivan Fischer's Bartok, then his would have to receive top kudos. But to the best of my knowledge Fischer hasn't recorded the \\"Four Orchestral Pieces\\", the viola concerto, the two violin concertos or \\"Bluebeard's Castle\\" (and probably several other lesser works). Even if Boulez strikes some folks as 'too cool' for Bartok's paprika and garlic laced modernism, it would be difficult to find fault with such an illustrious line-up of soloists: Gil Shaham, Kristian Zimmerman, Pierre-Laurent Aimard, Helene Grimaud, Yuri Bashmet (viola), Jessye Norman, etc. In short, if you want to collect the orchestral Bartok in a convenient box at a bargain price (albeit with slip-sleaves instead of jewel cases), your ship has just arrived.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|for a former Mario kid, its a great game. It reminds me of the good ol days. only a few levels in but so far so good.
1451629184|4.0|Jaycee Dugard's indomitable spirit gives hope to anyone who experiences any human challenge. Although she was taken from her life and family for almost two decades and endured horrific sexual and mental abuse, Jaycee stayed true to herself and her principles. It is not surprising that with her natural human empathy, she even felt the pain of her captors...in the true \\"Stockholm syndrome.\\" She analysed the world in which she was bound. She held on to the memory of her past, she had a love affair with nature...from a kitten to any creature that appeared in her captivity and she wrote her journal. She made the best of what she had. Would that any of us could do the same. May Jaycee thrive now in love and recovery bearing witness to what a human being can do with proper thinking. God bless!
0062082353|5.0|Great read period!!!! Very insightful keeps u reading excellent insight.  Makes u realize how much these men and women and their families sacrifice for our country!!!
B0041B785Y|5.0|This is one those albums people have been waiting for with crossed fingers.<br />Well fear not! Meshuggah have done it again. On Koloss they have taken<br />a slightly more stripped down approach to the songwriting and production that<br />works quite well. This gives the band a tighter more groove oriented sound than  on previous albums. Overall this is a very good effort from meshuggah, but what did you expect?
B006JD48NM|5.0|I really enjoyed this documentary. I have always followed Formula One racing since the Jackie Stewart days. I was very aware of both Senna and Prost. I always liked Senna better because he was such a daring racer. This documentary captured his intensity and some of the political problems he encountered with Formula One. He was an amazing driver and he is missed. I would recommend this video to anyone who follows Formula One.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|Just updated when Amazon said there was one. Now it wont even open. Now I will probably lose all my completed levels as I need to uninstall and reinstall. Will never update this fast again.
B0063GORYU|5.0|it is really easy to navigate n is truley relaxing. Good. clear visuals. gotta give it a try. thx 4 creating it

B006IGZX0C|5.0|I thought this movie was funny and thought provoking.  It even made me cry a little which almost never happens to me when I watch movies.  My boyfriend liked it too.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I think this game is really cool,  but as soon as you start playing you run out of energy! this game would be much more fun if you didn't run out of energy and then have to pay five bucks to do anything.
B007SSDS24|4.0|This was a lot better than I expected -- kind of like Cloverfield, but without the nausea-inducing handheld camera work (or the monster). Definitely worth a rental, and I'm hoping they make a sequel.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|It is a spin off of Mario. But I still like it becuase yet it is amusing. I like to play mario and this game. It is a good spin off of Mario

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Short Attention Span Summary:<br /><br />1. Unbelievably naïve college student does her friend a favor by interviewing a young successful business entrepreneur.<br />2. Turns out that he's hot<br />3. She can't believe that he would be attracted to her, but he starts showing up on her home turf<br />4. She is slightly bothered that he has extreme stalker tendencies, but \\"Oh My!\\" he's hot<br />5. She is bothered by his extravagant gifts, but \\"Oh My!\\" he's hot<br />6. She rolls her eyes and chews her lip, which make him hot - \\"Oh My!\\"<br />7. He makes her an offer that most people would refuse, and she thinks about it for most of the book<br />8. While thinking about it, she discovers her inner kinky and does the dirty ad nauseum<br />9. He's temperamental, damaged, domineering and a total pain in the tail, but has incredible stamina in the sack, is perfect in every other way, and of course - \\"Oh My!\\" - he's like, totally hot!<br />10. She sends a lot of e-mail and texts, rolls her eyes, picks at food and drinks rather too much Twinnings tea &/or alcohol, while borrowing clothes from her BFF (as she doesn't seem to have anything decent of her own) and occasionally from other sources.<br />11. The erotica starts off hot and sweaty, but by the time they get to the REALLY freaky stage the reader is too sated to care all that much.<br />12. Everything is left hanging at the end.<br /><br />Initially I was excited about this book and didn't want to put it down, but as it went on it became apparent that the BDSM was the core of the story, and that dialogue and plot and character development were of much lesser importance.  The \\"hot and steamy\\" was fine, but without believable characters, back story or direction it all became rather repetitive and tiresome and fifty shades of boredom.<br /><br />This is essentially a YA romance turned into a R-rated story with little dialogue adjustment other than the erotica, and would make an extremely shallow movie if they stick to the book.  However I can totally see Ian Somerhalder as Christian Grey, and maybe Mia Wachowski as Anastasia.<br /><br />Steamy in this case turns out to be mostly hot air.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, April 14, 2012ook.

B004LL1HM4|4.0|Very well-done, relaxed music. Very acoustic-guitar and mood-based, with some Crosby, Stills, and Nash-style harmonizing. Really great to listen to on an morning weekend or for driving out in the country. Just makes you feel cleaner and better. Good band.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I can not beloved that their are people giving this game a 1 star. it works great on kindle fire and has very few ads. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|fun game you can guess what it is desinged after but still fun and perfect for my kintergardnerthanks for the game
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game! once you start playing you wont want to stop! :) can be frustrating at times but merely because the games get hard.
B0045I3EJC|5.0|A movie with Jared Leto are the best movies.<br />A great story and chilling scenes, like the butterfly effect but<br />totally worth buying.<br />I enjoy it &lt;3
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is a lot of fun if u like Mario you will love peps world very fun game very good download it
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I am really enjoying playing this version of Oregon trail. loved the original as a kid and now really enjoying this one too.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game has been fun to play and certainly keeps you coming back for more. There are a lot of options for in-game purchases to move along more quickly but with patience it seems you can avoid spending real cash if you don't want to do so. The level of detail in the game is impressive.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Leave it to the  BBC to create the perfect antidote to the reality show fever we have suffered far too long. DA is a soap opera, for sure, but the historic setting, production values and Emmy-worthy acting and writing transcend the genre. Suitable for ages 10 and up. Even my husband enjoys this show, and he's a guy who watches the Military channel most of the time.
B005ETA5K2|1.0|I received this item in a timely manner in the condition described.  However, after downloading the software included, the network adapter does not work.  There are no instructions.  There must be some solution to getting this to work as I have seen it work on another computer.  Hence I cannot give it more than one star as it is non-functional--at least at this point in time.
B0058VW36U|5.0|i give it 5 stars. Great game! even though they haven't updated it yet I still think it's a super app!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|best game ever it's just like Mario but better and easier I love it so you should get it love it.
B003D83DPA|5.0|I can't believe the crap I 'm reading here. How many of you trashing the blu-ray were fans back in 1983? I had this on CASSETTE.....AUDIO cassette.......two of them back in the day. I loved it then and I love it now...to finally SEE it...sorry if you're disappointed the blu-ray doesn't look like blu-rays recorded today.<br /><br />I just wish you'd shut up or someone else might not pull something so awesome from the vault like this... and the bonus material is fabulous.<br />if you're reading this wondering whether or not to get it, stop wondering. it's great. the opening version of once upon a time in the west is alone enough to make it worth the money. just stellar arranging. mark was and is a fabulous MUSICIAN.
1574216988|5.0|This is a wonder book. I refer back to it often. It has great instructions and hints on shading. Well worth the price.
B000654YRY|5.0|I 'm sorry I waited so long to get this. I saw DS on the Brothers in Arms tour and was very dissappointed they did not come to florida for this one.<br />They were quite simply a stunning live band by this time in their career. The drummer on this tour is the best one they ever had; he had great feel and made a nice sound on the drums. He didn't overplay. Mark , of course, was brilliant. And he seemed to really enjoy the crowd response at this show. Well deserved indeed. I choked up a few times watching this , because this is really how music should be made.<br />Outstanding.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Wow. Reading this book brought back a TON of memories. I read this growing up and really liked it. I recently bought it for my Kindle and have been reading it again. It seems more relevant today than it ever did.<br /><br />Orson Scott Card does an incredible job at creating a realistic future world. His perceptions of human behavior and the way he allows those to come through subtly through character's actions and words shows his skill as an author. His characterizations are brilliant, and of all the books I have read and all the characters I have come in contact with in my reading, Ender Wiggin definitely shines as one of the most realistic and well-portrayed.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone, young adult or old adult. It is a landmark piece of literature that shaped me as a child and has shaped me again as I read it this past week.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|fun and easy. reminds me a bit of the sonic the hedgehog game. favorite game to play on my kindle fire.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I really enjoyed reading Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's works in this short collection of Sherlock Holmes stories. It was entertaining and interesting to read. These works and Sherlock Holmes are classics always to be remembered.<br /><br />I was disappointed in some of the Kindle formatting. Odd character's appeared at random locations (especially when they meant to show the symbol for the British Pound). However, that does not detract from the brilliance of this classic masterpiece.
B0055SWM08|5.0|The game's concept is really simple, but it is suprisingly fun to play.  The game is good if you are looking to play for a few minutes at a time since there really isn't much in variety in the gameplay to keep me interested very long.
B005LAIGWS|2.0|I understand what Goyer and Cage was trying to do with this movie but it fails on so many levels. G.R. was created in the 1970's and this movie was going for that whole, \\"Grindhouse,\\" feel and it delievers but weak. The first movie needed better action, villains (the trio of fallen angels could've been a threat but nope) and this movie gives us better action + Blackout (much better but I could have done better with the action directing). Spirit of Vengeance also missed many chances for some funny/serious jokes and not this corny crap. The first movie was way better as far as everything else goes (Mephisto, more of a Marvel Comic style in family, friends and a lesson learned). In complete and honest truth, the Ghost Rider character will not get the movie he so richly deserves until Marvel Studios does him justice.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I enjoy a good read.  These books are well written, although there were some interesting font size issues with Book 1.  Hopefully this was just with my kindle.<br />With the popularity of the Hunger Games movie, I wanted to read the books because I could get into the character's heads; understand what they were thinking and why they did what they did.  Katniss and her family lived a rough life.  Leaving the safety of the fence, Katniss meets up with her friend Gale and hunt for their food.  Little does she know that her skills at hunting will help her during the Hunger Games.  Who determines who gets chosen?  Why only the young people from 12 to 18?  What does Peeta have to do with Katniss, and how did they meet?  How does Gale and Peeta work into Katniss' future?  And what about Buttercup, the ugly cat?  Check it out and find out.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|LLove this. Convenient and helpful little app. Easy to use an convenient for quick reminders to myself and list making for running errands, etc.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very fun my wife and kids all love the scrat the ingame scrat movie is awesome good job with the development
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|Sultry.  Poppy.  jAZZY.  Thus SPAZZY!  Imagine a nerd with knocking knees, thick glasses, and a propeller hat.  Head tilted sideways with curiosity, listening to some truly strange noises.  If you can empathize with such a geek, then this album is likely to please.  With lyrics primarily based on relationships, a cunning edge, and wit like a dry martini, it is likely more popular with the ones from Venus than those from Mars.  I could see some of the many catchy songs played on the more earthly, melancholy relationship downturns in the Big Bang Theory.<br /><br />I agree with some other reviews stating there are a few too many/similar sounding songs toward the end.  Talent abounds in all facets of the music, but I hope this beautiful voice finds a different supporting instrument arrangement next time 'round (not different performers, just a different sound). This album fills a unique, beautiful, classy glass, but slightly overfills it.  Time for a different one.  Nowhere on this album does she \\"wail it and nail it\\" like I think she could.  This album is all under control, seemingly contrived. Dare I suggest \\"manufactured\\".<br /><br />But I like it!!!<br /><br />Best served with wine and/or as a companion during some downtime, but not to be consumed just after a breakup.
B0059XTUXQ|3.0|Great story, but focuses more on the decline due to aging than the political accomplishments.  For such a great historical figure is should be more thought provoking.  Rather is seemed more like a flash back episode of \\"FRIENDS\\" when the had no new footage to use. Meryl was outstanding, her best role yet.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|loved this every level.gits easier. and easier. will love this got to try this tu. achon filed. game. love this
B0055SWM08|5.0|great puzzle game with a great atmosphere. I love the music as well as the difficulty. great graphics as well
159420229X|5.0|I usually do not read for leisure, but once I started reading this book, I could not set it down. Joshua Foer does a brilliant job in Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything to capture the audience's attention. He combines his own experience with the history of memory to make you want to continue reading until the book is complete. Published by the Penguin Group (USA) on March 3, 2011, I can completely understand why this book has received various awards and even the title as one of the \\"Best Books of 2011.\\"<br /><br />  This novel begins with Joshua's own initial experience with trying to locate the \\"smartest individual\\" in the world. He has trouble locating one specific individual but continues digging into the subject matter, specifically revolving around the idea of mass memorization. He ends up discovering that there is an international circuit of memorizers. They use ancient techniques created thousands of years ago to memorize poems, sermons, prayers, speeches, and other important articles. Foer later explained that memory was the only way for humans to store information. Before written text and computers, all information was passed on through word of mouth. If you were able to memorize a vast amount of information, you would have been considered highly valuable because you could store so much knowledge.<br /><br />  He keeps searching deeper into the information about memorization when he finds a few special individuals. These individuals supposedly were born with some of the greatest minds for memory capacity. They could remember everything anyone ever told them. Foer then continued to locate the most forgetful individual in the world called EP. He would only be able to hold onto a memory for a few minutes at best. While sifting through these documents he kept finding a familiar researcher's name. Being a journalist he decided to visit this researcher whose name was K. Anders Ericson. This is when Foer finally decided to puthimself to the test. His memory would be tested initially, and then retested once he mastered the ancient memorization techniques.<br /><br />  After further researching the best of the best in memory competitions, he asks a few of them to mentor and help him hone his skills so he can eventually compete in a memory competition. One man in particular, Ed Cooke, decided to help Foer become a memory master.  Cooke taught Foer the ancient memory techniques; the first was to translate what you are trying to remember into images and store them in a place that you can easily visualize in your mind's eye. The more outrageous the mental images, the more likely they would linger in your head. This made it easy for Foer to memorize to do lists and peoples' faces. He later uses the technique of Person-Action-Object (PAO). In this system every 2-digit number from 00-99 is represented by a single image of a person performing an action on an object. One can then simply recognize any 6-digit number by combining the person from the first two numbers, the action from the second two numbers, and the object from the third two numbers. This technique can also be modified for a deck of playing cards. One then can place each of these PAO's into your mental palace to store the information.<br /><br />  Eventually Foer convinced Discover magazine to send him to Europe to create an article about the World Memory Championship. He learned a vast amount of information and tips from all of the competitors in the competition. His memory-training regimen began to pick up and his memory began to expand. His times were improving and even his methods of memorization were getting better. His dedication to the \\"sport\\" of memory was paying off. However, he eventually reached a plateau. His times in memorizing a deck of cards were no longer improving. Through the help of his mentors he eventually realized that it was because his mind was on autopilot when he was memorizing new decks of cards. He was unaware that his mind was fine with how fast he could memorize a deck of cards. He had to mentally push himself to pass this \\"OK plateau\\" and continue improving his ability.<br /><br />  While researching his competitors, he found some interesting characters. One man, Raemon Matthews, is trying to implement these memory techniques in today's schools system. His students are always very successful on AP tests and national exams; he has won two citywide \\"Teacher of the Year\\" awards for his work. Daniel Tammet was another interesting individual he discovered. He was allegedly a savant, but Foer found various holes in his story. Tammet then led Foer to a real savant named Kim Peek. Better known as Rain Man, Peek was truly amazing. He only had an IQ of 87, but he could read one page of a book with each eye and memorize phone book after phone book of numbers and corresponding names.<br /><br />  Eventually Foer reached a level of memorization where he felt confident in competing in the US Memory Championship. He competes phenomenally well for his first attempt. He ends up being in the final two for the title as US Memory Champion. To his astonishment, he walks away victorious in his first memory competition!<br /><br />  After the completion, Foer went back to K. Anders Ericson to retest himself. The results showed that he was an average individual, but after his training his memory became extraordinary.<br /><br />  As I have mentioned before, this book really grasped my attention. Maybe it was because I have always been interested in memory, but I could just not set it down. It made me truly think about my own mental capacity and capability. I tried some of the simple techniques within the book and found them to be extremely helpful. I still remember the to-do list given to Foer in the beginning of his training because I used a memory palace to remember the items. This book made me think about the learning techniques that I learned as a child. It made me question if our school system was teaching the proper way for students to gain knowledge. I've also realized that the brain is very similar to a muscle. If someone were to train it everyday, him or her could become a memory champion just like Foer. This novel emphasizes the fact that everyone has the ability to memorize a vast amount of information. We just need to learn the proper techniques and train our minds accordingly. Our memories can be limitless if we truly desire them to be.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Get it now, very captivating and complex gameplay. Thoroughly enjoyed this little gem. Word word word word word word word
0345803485|1.0|I think even marginally gifted writers the world over must be crying into a stiff drink when they learn of this book being successful because it's awful.  Really.  Truly.  Horrible.<br /><br />First there's the writing.  Did an editor actually go through this book after the author wrote it?  If yes, whoever that person is should lose their job since they obviously can't edit their way out of a paper bag. The author is an amateur storyteller and the editor did not at all help fix that.  Lose the italics showing the heroine's thoughts.  Lose the references to \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"subconscious\\" because it's not cute and is annoying.  By the way, reading the heroine repeatedly say things like, \\"Holy crap!\\" isn't cute, either.<br /><br />Next there's the story.  Sexually pure young girl gets into BDSM upon meeting the richer than God and psychologically disturbed hero.  Yeah.  OK.  Other than the BDSM and psychologically disturbed bit, what's new beyond a standard romance novel that this book should get so much praise?  (By the way, I've read plenty of romance novels and most were better than this book by a mile.)<br /><br />So what's the attraction to this book?  Sex?  BDSM?  There is nothing in this book that is going to teach you any new sex tricks or open the window into the BDSM world.  If it does, I would suggest you put down the book, open your front door, walk out and live a little.<br /><br />I am shocked that there are any positive reviews on here.  I can understand getting suckered into reading it (heck, I did), but to actually find it good?  Yikes.  Really, go outside, smell the fresh air, and live a little.  Then you'll know that the only scandalous thing about this book is the fact they are charging so much for something so bad.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I have the Deluxe version because I love Flo that much. Her voice opens all sails and takes you away on her journey. Her voice has incredible range and The Machine provide incredible back up to her vocals. Harps seem rare nowadays in songs, but take a song like \\"Cosmic Love\\" the creativity of the lyrics sung by her powerful voice is aided into captivating the listener with the impressive instruments by the band. It's not just \\"Cosmic Love\\" it's every song booming with drums and the harmonious harp. \\"You've Got the Love\\" is a cover and it's better than the original by a long shot. Florence + The Machine deserves a listen to every song at least once.
B0058VW36U|5.0|well the game is really fun my kids love the game and it keeps them occupied. and I like it to nice game.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I purchased the trilogy and was disappointed when it ended.  A very good read and one that keeps your attention to the end of the last book.  Highly recommend!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is really cool its fun to play when your bored.and the best is .....u have control over your village :D
B0075PYG1M|5.0|I have really been sleeping on Robert Glasper. When I heard the album, I was amazed. Now I have purchased ALL of his albums. Good Work!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is actually one of my fav's.  just like M. brothers lol.  my daughter and I plays this game all the time non stop. you should totally download this game asap.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I bought this CD specifically for one song but have ended up loving the whole thing. There isn't a song on the album that sounds remotely like another but yet they are all great. It's rare to find a cd you don't have to skip tracks!!  I had never heard of Gotye before but I'm already looking for more music.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game so much fun just like Mario bro which is like my favorite game In the world :) I love playing this game its fun and addictive!
B004EPYZUI|3.0|Really all you need to know is that this movie was directed by Zack Snyder (300 and Watchmen) who, like Tim Burton, really only makes one kind of movie. If you liked 300 or Watchmen you are going to like this movie, if you didn't you are going to hate it. Snyder's style is all over this thing: crazy physical fights, dark brooding world, LOTS of slow motion, bad dialogue, titillation and the ending is depressing. Think of it as a hour and a half plus long music video with some dialogue and \\"story\\" thrown in. It's part Kill Bill, part Moulin Rogue and I suppose a hint of Inception because of the psychological stuff going on. I will admit that the movie is visually stunning and the actresses in it work the tiny outfits costuming made for them, but just don't expect a super deep or comprehensive story from this campy action flick.<br />If you're going to buy it I would suggest the Blu-Ray for the enhanced audio and video, since that is really the meat and Potatoes of this movie, and the cut out footage actually does make a difference. They sliced the movie to eek out a PG-13 rating, but since that didn't save Sucker Punch from dreadful box office numbers, they should have just gone for the R and been happy with it.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I didn't know what I was getting into, but considering how much I hate Snyder's other works, I'm amazed that didn't hate this one despite its cliches and fan boy pandering. I guess you can make a silk purse out of a sows ear if you put it in a school girl's uniform then arm it with a Samurai sword and .45 semi-automatic.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Every now and then i love a book that is fun to read.<br />I know people will write a lot about the erotic plot and details, but i see it as a very teasing and touching story.<br />It is defently a page-turner for any woman who likes courtship and romance (and sex, of course).<br />Problem is, man like Christian Grey don't exsist much in reality :-)<br /><br />book 2 is the best.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|liked it at first.  it seemed to work like any other game out there (farmville anyone?)  but it made me try fishing and I'm stuck there.  wasting time as the rest of the game is going along as usual. contemplating uninstalling and reinstalling
B007PTJOV0|5.0|well done platform game. nice graphics. easy controls. pretty simple gameplay. if you like platforms check it out. nice work.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I must say when the show first aired last summer I figured I would DVR it and see what it was about. I really like horror movies and enjoy anything with werewolves so I figured it couldn't hurt to check it out. Once I watched the first episode and saw Colton Haynes playing Jackson I was hooked! Colton is amazing; the rest of the cast is fine and somewhat enjoyable but I must say that Colton is the reason I will continue to love this show! I think you should give it a shot, it's not as campy as the movie; it's a little darker but I think that makes it even better.. I am looking forward to season 2!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|More pig hunting, in different settings.<br />Requiring a wider range of shooting skills.<br />Some taking a very long time to solve.

B004VUP8WK|1.0|I was excited to hear the new album but when I did I was embarrassed for the band. DO NOT BUY THIS!  This album has a few \\"traditional\\" Death Metal songs but they sound like tracks left on the cutting room floor during the recording of Heretic, the rest of the album is a weird mix of industrial & something even worse. The Lyrics had me laughing out loud they are so bad. To top it off, the great Pete Sandoval is absent from this rubbish........lucky for him<br />Well, what do you expect from a CD called I dive in a mans anus  or whatever the hell its called.  RIP  Morbid Angel
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am so hooked on this trilogy! It is pretty explicit but I love it. Women love it but men should read it too.

B0012GTZC0|2.0|I love Ken Follett books!  This book took me so long to get into the story.  I think it took half the book until I really got into the story and character.  The last half of the book is great.  The first half is long and confusing.  His other books are much better!  I'd still read a Follett book, no one's perfect.  :)
0393061310|1.0|Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel may be one of the most overrated and uninformed books in the social sciences ever written. Diamond's historical analysis is considerable in regard to the differences in human development over time and place; however, his explanations as to why these vast differences occured is superficial at best. It is obvious that the author is searching for causes that fit into his theory, yet are nothing more than loosely related correlations. Clearly, the author has set out to explain away the differences in human development as a result of anything but intelligence. His ideology of and unspoken belief in equality of races will not allow him to assert anything that suggests that intelligence plays any role in the monumental differences in human development that span centuries and even millenia across the globe. He rests his arguments on many claims that are absurd. He does not even address the work of other accomplished academics that contradict his entire theory, such as Richard Lynn's IQ and Global Inequality or Herrnstein's The Bell Curve. Challenging the work of other academics is critical to establishing credibility of any scientific work and this proves that Diamond is a pseudo-scientist afraid of criticism.<br /><br />In the first few chapters, Diamond dismisses IQ tests as outside the realm of science without any explanation whatsoever. Nevermind that no evidence exists to disprove the validity of IQ tests, that IQ tests have consistently shown comparable results across time, countries, cultures, and methods, even when adjusting for cultural differences. I guess his liberal philosophies place him too far up the righteous tower to bother countering the one thing that undermines the entire foundation of his work. Instead, he makes the outrageous claim that indigenous cultures are superior to European cultures, given that they are more 'aware of their surroundings', whatever that means. I hardly think that peoples who had no written languages, no paper or printing press, no means to disseminate or accumulate knowledge, no methods of exploration or discovery, and no understanding of science or technology are much aware of their surroundings in any respect. Typical of leftist social scientists, these kinds of unproven claims make Diamond come across as 'worshipping the other', putting the cultures of the indigenous on an untouchable pedestal while at the same time despising the cultures that made the knowledge and publication of this book even possible.<br /><br />Most of Diamond's claims are easily disproven by anyone with a rudimentary background in history and social science or even a basic notion of logic and reason. Diamond asserts that differences in geography and climate mostly accounted for the divergences in development. It was these conditions, he argues, that allowed for fertile soil, harvesting of crops which necessitated the arrival of domesticated animals, and the creation of technologies that facilitated these functions, the most obvious being the wheel. Apparently, those cultures that evolved out of hot, arrid climates such as the Middle East, Africa, parts of South America, and Australia had no means to develop agricultural practices which was largely a foundation for building more complex, political societies. This is all an interesting correlation but hardly causation. Here Diamond shines in his depiction of how societies diverged, but his failure to comprehend obvious outstanding examples is where he comes up short. For one, white Europeans have adapted to all hostile environments known to man. From the deserts of Nevada and Southwestern United States to the Australian outback to Antarctica and the North Pole, Europeans have mastered these geographies and produced some of the richest societies on Earth there where the indigenous populations had produced absolutely nothing. Why the limitations of environment and geography were easily overcome by Europeans but not others is not adequately explained by Diamond. He only delves into the applications of technologies as a mechanism for adapting to various terrains, while never getting to the real origin of why those technologies and tools were discovered and applied in the first place: intelligence.<br /><br />The other obvious counterargument to Diamond's pseudo-science is the lack of development of Native Americans despite occupying some of the most arable land on Earth for thousands of years. North America is bursting with resources, metals, and indigenous domestic animals of all kinds, and yet the natives never even invented the wheel. This completely contradicts Diamond's theory, which if held up to any serious academic scrutiny by credible scientists, would never even approach the authority of publication. The obvious conclusion is that the environment is not an obstacle to an intelligent race. Searching for 'a better way of doing things' is not universal among races. Had the different races been equally intelligent, there would not be a gap in human development that spans hundreds of years, especially now during an age of globalism.<br /><br />One of my favorite examples from the book, which Diamond regards as illustrative of how the application of technology influenced European expansion, comes from his analysis of the Battle of Cajamarca in 1532. Here Diamond attempts to show that the application of various metals resulting in swords and shields, combined with the domestication of the horse, allowed 169 Spaniards to vanquish an army of 80,000 natives in South America. To be sure, the superior technology and advantage of horses aided in their victory. Which all came about because of European's fertile soil and access to trade, etc. the author claims. Yet there have been numerous cases throughout history where less advanced armies have defeated superior enemies, such as the Picts defeat of the Romans or the Russian defeat of Germany. In the case of the Spaniards being outnumbered nearly 500 to1, superior technology was certainly not the cause of their victory. Rather, superior intelligence combined with tactics, strategy, and organization were more important factors.<br /><br />Like most social scientists in the unapproachable high towers of academics, Diamond subscribes to the underlying philosophy that all things being equal, the same results would have occured no matter what race or cultures had possession of greater means which is completely false. An England full of Africans is still England. A Mexico full of Guatemalans is still Mexico. The world's population is just interchangable. Had Africans or Australian aborigines the proper conditions, it would have been they who sailed to Europe and exported their cultures rather than the other way around. Yet Diamond can't even see the obvious: all over the world, where Europeans settled in large numbers, prosperity and quality of life followed, along with continous progress in technology and economic growth. Today, wherever large numbers of those from developing nations congregate, the opposite occurs in nearly every single case in every developed country despite equal opportunity. Clearly, it is intelligence that results in these differences in development, not some accident of origin in geographic relation to resources. The question should be why did Europeans develop the advantages in the first place despite similar geographic obstacles, not why did those advantages contribute to developmental differences.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good history of human development, industry, and technology, this book may be for you. If you're looking for credible, solid science proving how the differences in prosperity and development across the globe came to exist - why Africans live in mud huts while Europeans fly to the moon - then you are in for serious disappointment.
B005LAIH54|1.0|Disclaimer: I love sword and sorcery films.<br /><br />With this said, this movie seemed to be a grouping of special effects in search of a plot and a script.<br /><br />There are so many substantive problems with this film that it is difficult to know where to begin.<br /><br />Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are two of the finest actors of their generation. However, they are given very little to do in this film. Furthermore, their dialogue sounds like it was written by a bored high school student attempting to hurriedly complete a creative writing assignment.<br /><br />Additionally, the plot has an extremely tenuous relationship with its Greek mythological subject matter. For instance, the three brothers --Hades, Poseidon and Zeus --combined their forces during a decade-long war to defeat and imprison their tyrannical father, Kronos. Apart from being cosimically dangerous, Kronos attempted to murder these men (and all of their sibling) at birth by devouring them. Why this film would have Hades attempting to free his father given their blood-spilling history defies logic. Another example of this is Hades telling Zeus that he was to blame for his banishment in the Underworld. This is completely inaccurate. After Kronos was defeated, the three brothers drew straws to determine who would rule the Sky (Zeus), the Sea (Poseidon) and the Underworld. Hades, the eldest of the three brothers, drew the shortest straw and was left to govern the Underworld which consisted of Heaven (Elysian Fields), Purgatory and Tartarus (Hell). In some versions of the story, Zeus, the youngest brother, made sure that he knew which straw would be the longest, and thus, which territory he would claim. However, there is no Greek folklore that indicated that Hades was displeased with the territory he governed (or the lot he drew, no pun intended). In fact, he was construed to be as distant, stoic and remote as Pluto, the (former) planet named for him. Thus, the movie's premise that Hades harbored a deep hatred for his brothers and could both forgive and side with his father is not particularly credible.<br /><br />Finally, the movie seems to push its heroes toward fraternal and romantic relationships where there is no need for any. (In fact, their interactions with each other seem forced and gratuitous.) The main characters do not have to like each other. Their mission is to save the world from Kronos -- a titan with a mean streak and the power to shatter the universe.<br /><br />Are there any positive attributes to the film?<br /><br />Yes, portions of it look cool.<br /><br />But, do yourself a favor: watch the film on mute so you are not distracted by its illogical plot and haphazard dialogue.a deep hatred for his brothers and could both forgive and side with his father is not particularly credible.<br /><br />Finally, the movie seems to push its heroes toward fraternal and romantic relationships where there is no need for any.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is more like a ripoff than a trilogy. If thirty dollars was the price they wanted then that is how it should have been priced.  Great marketing and advertising for a poorly written book designed to entice women  for it's eroticism. The proof readers or whoever's job it is should have been more careful with the grammar and spelling, and the author seems not to have too much of a vocabulary. She surely can \\"mutter\\" and \\"smirk\\" on how women lined up to purchase this drivel!

0439023513|1.0|(Spoiler Alert)  After struggling to put down The Hunger Games and finding Catching Fire to be almost as good as the first.....I struggled to even finish Mockingjay.  Too many moments where Katniss dissolves within herself...Not enough explanation of the Capitol's demise or the plots of District 13 or its official role in the rebellion and its leaders true intentions.....And most dissatisfying of all the disintegration of all of the relationships Katniss held dear that made her who she was and the first book so enjoyable.  Not sure what the author was trying to get at in this last book, but I am sorry to say that I took the time to read them just to end up so deflated and with so many unanswered questions......
B002RKSZKI|4.0|To put it simply, this is a story about love in various forms and degrees. The most important thing about love and relationships, however, is that no one can control who a person does and does not love. It's entertaining to follow Emma Woodhouse as she tries to play matchmaker, thinking that she knows best, and in the end she even surprises herself. You could update the time period and everything is still completely applicable in today's world.<br /><br />Aside from the story, I should also like to note that the formatting of this story is fantastic on the Kindle, unlike some of the other Austen novels I'm reading (Pride & Prejudice's formatting is not as smooth).

Those looking for an in-depth discussion of physics will be disappointed, however they will be entertained! Read Feynman in love, Feynman the musician, the student, the traveler, the philosopher, the artist, the womanizer and most of all the scientist and person that is Feynman. From scientist to layman, anyone would have fun reading this book, don't let me spoil it anymore, go and read it for yourself!

B005LAIH4A|5.0|When I was little like most children I was a fan of Dr. Seuss.. I thought Dr. Seuss was the greatest. Years have passed and I still consider myself a Dr. Seuss lover! This is a way better movie than the Cat in the Hat and The Grinch. I liked Horton Hears a Who but the Lorax was the best of all the movies. The Lorax features lots of songs, and teaches kids lessons about the enviroment. The movie isn't just for little kids I found myself laughing during the movie when Betty White made jokes. People have criticized this movie for ruining the book but I think this is a great supplement to the book. How can you make a childrens book into a movie without adding plot lines and characters? This movie is a need more than a thneed!

0385535139|1.0|Yet, the latest underwhelming offering from John Grisham. Grisham seems to be living off his past glory. So many of his recent legal-themed novels are just mindless pap with simplistic plots, and the most basic syntax. He is just writing to get it done and make his money.  There is nothing satisfying about reading John Grisham anymore.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read the entire trilogy in 5 days. Suzanne Collins keeps you hanging.<br /><br />Her ability to capture your interest is amazing (though I don't recommend reading the books while you are tired). This dystopian novel captures every moment, creating images of all that is happening. She allowed her imagination to take over during her time of writing.<br /><br />I recommend reading the books before seeing the movie; at least the first book. It explains a lot of the movie; which is not detailed and lacking information in order to understand the just of what is happening.<br /><br />A good book does not need to be written perfectly in order to be interesting!

B005LAIGWS|1.0|Oh my god? How did they make make a even worse movie with ghost rider in it? They made Spirt of Vengeance!<br /><br />Okay, I saw this movie and it didn't make sense based from the first movie. The first movie ended with Johnny wanting to keep his powers and didn't want to give them up to the devil. The the devil wanted to take his powers away because he did a good job and he didn't need to have the curse anymore. Well, in this movie he is trying to get rig of his powers and is the exact opposite of what he wanted to do before? What? What a changed!<br /><br />If Johnny didn't want his power anymore, he could had just went to the devil and say, hey, I don't want the powers anymore, you can have them back! The devil will take them back with ease. The devils wants the powers back, it's not like he wants ghost rider to get in the way anyways. But, no that's doesn't come to mind in the writers mind at all huh.<br /><br />In the ending of the first movie it looked like Johnny had control over his powers and would only grow stronger with them. But that didn't come to the writers mind either. So, in this movie, he is losing control has loss control because he kept the ghost rider from coming out for so long. It just doesn't make sense.<br /><br />I really didn't like the fight scenes in this movie. They looked so lame. I actually like the first movie fights more and that is a under statement already.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert!!!<br /><br />If I get over the story from the beginning and totally forget it then it's okay after that. The Ghosts Riders trys to save a boy from bad men and if his does he will get his curse lifted from him. Johnny learns that the Ghost Rider gets his powers from an angel that got drag to hell and became a prisoner there. The angel grew more and more twisted the longer he was there. Then, the angel wasn't a angel anymore and become a spirt. That is, the spirt of vengeance. After some time, the devil will use this spirt powers to put into people andthat person is the ghost rider. Johnny after losing powers of course needs his powers again because he not strong enough to fighter bad guys without his powers. So, it turns out that the boy he saved is the devil son and he gives johnny his powers back.<br /><br />One more thing I should point out. If the devil's son has the devil's power as well, than the son can just take away Ghosts Riders powers anytime he wanted to. So, Johnny is pretty much on easy road, if he really didn't want his powers anymore.<br /><br />Okay, well that's a great story plot, it just didn't make much sense if you look at the first movie. This movie is a rental for sure.
6305291446|5.0|Good to see Jamie Lee Curtis back in this exciting sequal, even though the years of being stalked by Halloween Boogieman......Michael Myers, had taken its toll . Very exciting clkmax.....
B0051OZ564|5.0|Going into this movie I had a very open mind for this movie. I didn't see the trailer or read the summary. All I knew was that it had SUPER HOT CHICKS.<br /><br />Then, going into the movie I thought it started out slow, but quickly speeded up, when baby doll fought the Giant Robots. I wasn't expected that. I only seen those kinds of things in Japanese Anime. I really thought he was going to dance for the audience. lol<br /><br />From there on out, I was very into the movie. It seemed like there are a group of dancers and they all are force to dance to stay alive. There only escape is to get all the items they need to get out of that hell hole. Now, it seemed to show that every time baby doll would dance, she will go into this fantasy land and fight whoever to get special items to escape. In real time, she is really dancing, and others are helping her collect the real item they need to escape.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert!!!<br /><br />But, at the end of the movie, what we think is happening isn't really happening at all. It was a dream within a dreamworld. That's right. There TWO fantasy lands and we don't get back to \\"true reality\\" until the end of the movie. Then, baby doll gets sucker punch because she did no wrong. But, is forever gone to true reality because of her evil step-father and the bad guys that did that to her.<br /><br />What a Sucker Punch!
B005JE7WKI|4.0|A group of college kids go out to the woods to party... now wait, before you say \\"oh that cliche\\" hang on a second. At the same time as the kids go up, Dale and Tucker, a couple of Hillbillies have just bought a vacation home up in the same area of the woods. One night when they be a fishin' they encounter the college kids going for a skinny dip, and one of the kids ends up being startled by them, and falls into the water just after she hits her head on a rock... now Dale and Tucker didn't mean to frighten her, so they help her out of the water and attempt to have her friends come get her, but they get spooked and run off, so they take the pretty little girl back to their cabin to let her rest and intend for her friends to come by soon and pick her up. But her friends think the hillbillies are kidnappers and what not.<br /><br />Now you can probably see where this movie is going... as the college kids try to find their missing friend, one by one they accidentally start, well, killing themselves accidentally. Now you should get the gist of this comedy movie and what is going on here. Dale and Tucker are innocent and wouldn't kill anyone, but bad luck just seems to follow them around and things just start happening.<br /><br />It's not the first time a movie like this has been made where someone thinks, or there IS a maniac on the loose and people accidentally die, one such attempt almost worked in \\"I know what you did last Friday the 13th\\" which had its moments, but this film really nails it in a clever little way that is not only smart, but also hilarious and almost brilliant at the same time.<br /><br />Definitely worthy of purchasing your own comedy if this sort of thing already sounds appealing to you.

B003H6KRIE|5.0|All 3 films are pretty sitting on the edge of your seat exciting but most folk already know the story lines.  The first of the 3 films, The Bourne Identity has both excellent video and very discreet channel tracking in the audio.  The sound mixers did an excellent job of using all the surround channels and did not allow the soundtrack to hide the various foley effects in any of the front or rear channels.  Of course, in all the excitement, your subwoofer will get a fine workout.  The video transfer is quite good with no video noise, aliasing or artifacts.  This movie started the whole franchise and it was a super start.  My only question was how Bourne getting shot in the back brought out his amnesia in the first place.  That was never really answered as amnesia would generally come about from a serious head trauma and not from 2 bullets in the back.<br /><br />The Bourne Supremacy, the second film of the trilogy, made far greater use of the hand held camera, and while it didn't bother me, I recall a friend, and professional photographer, mentioning that it got him seasick.  The video transfer on Blu ray was excellent in all respects, but I also noticed a great deal less of directional audio use.  Rather than put money into more discreet sound editing the producers boosted up the sound track which pretty much enveloped the entire sound stage, front and rear.  It's not that the soundtrack did not fit the film, it certainly does, and creates the ambience of excitement the Bourne film requires, but a greater focus on the 5.1 sound stage for foley effects would have been nice.<br /><br />The last of the Trilogy, the  Bourne Ultimatum, completes the package with equal strength in the video transfer.  I saw no weaknesses in any of the video transfers for the 3 films, but once again, in the Bourne Ultimatum, you would think that with all the excitement going on, that  usage of the front sides and rear surrounds would be more prominent.  I was disappointed that, like the Bourne Supremacy, they simply upped the audio levels of the soundtrack which would overshadow any foley effects.<br /><br /> I'm not saying there is no use of the discreets in either of the last two films, but no where as much as what could have been or as was used in the first Bourne Identity.  To save $ they just boost the soundtrack level and that is a shame.  During the fight scene there are things being thrown, glass breaking, and all sorts of mayhem that easily could have been steered to the left or right, front or back.  Thus, on that score, I was disappointed.<br /><br />Never the less, this is a great collection to have and the excitement and pacing of the 3 films is just excellent.  There are plenty of deleted scenes and other 'making of' shorts as well as commentary with no wasted space for previews and ads for other movies. Well worth the cost.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksurne Supremacy, they simply upped the audio levels of the soundtrack which would overshadow any foley effects.<br /><br /> I'm not saying there is no use of the discreets in either of the last two films, but no where as much as what could have been or as was used in the first Bourne Identity.

B007H7XJD4|3.0|Interesting movie...worth a rental at least.  Some good graphics and fight scenes.  Interesting story as well.  I'll probably watch it again sometime.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its pretty fun. great way to pass the time when I am supposed to be working. snarf. snarf....snarf. and snarf.
B0072X2O66|2.0|Is it just me or does Allen sound like a mix of Draiman from Disturbed,Jorn Lande & Brent Smith from Shinedown.Besides from All on the Line which is a fantastic song,every other song sounds like a combustion of various bands into one.Mike Portnoy is a awesome drummer but let's face it,this band isn't that metal from every other that rises out,they are just a normal band with two headliners in Allen & Portnoy.Some songs sound like Disturbed and others sound like a rock band but nothing metal about it whatsoever.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this trilogy!  I read the whole thing in just 5 days.  It is a very interesting and gripping story that I could not put down.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is really fun.....the only problem is that some of the games are hard to pass and some of them are pointless......over all a good game
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Angry Birds Space is a fantasic addition to the series!  It's great fun to play and I highly recommend it!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I think this game is so good for being free. it kicks the Ass of farmville in what you can do.
B0064NTZJO|1.0|dont believe the hype. you may hear plenty of praise for this movie about the story or acting maybe the violence.<br />the main characters are dull, the story has been done before (but most things are based on other stories)but this film does not deliver anything interesting. the violence is brutal but seen mostly off screen with brief insert edits to show close-up violence. the first car chase seem is the only thing that is kinda refreshing but not interesting or fun.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun and very addictive its nice when you have nothing to do too!<br />its very interactive you can shoot fish cut trees and a lot more definitely worth the download!
B003Y5HWMW|1.0|since season 2 just debuted on hbo recently me and girlfriend decided to start watching season 1.<br />we both have varying opinions on movie selections she leans more to romantic comedies and I tend to watch asian crime drama.<br /><br />we both did not like this show. we thought it was slow, all of the characters are not interesting I don't care for their personal stories or the main plot/story.<br /><br />to be fair, i must say we decided to stop watching after episode 5 in a 10 episode season.
B0041T52S6|5.0|This film is a homage to such classic tales as Hercules while also forging into new territory all it's own.  Destined to become a classic that should go beyond \\"cult\\"status.  Buy it and share it with friends.  It would be wrong to keep this gem to yourself.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game! It reminds me so much of Mario and I'm so glad I got it for my Kindle fire. definately a good time waster.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|my opinion of this game is awesome outstanding and amazing! I ain't any expert but if I made the game I would make no changes.
B005PW3OS8|1.0|I was unable to watch the movie because it never loaded. Originally said it would load in 2hrs then continued to 3, 4, 5, then 6hrs and never did load. Very upset w/amizon! Still got charged!
0345803485|1.0|This book was odd, disturbing, and no love story by any means. I wish I had known that I could have gotten my money back for it within seven days because I definitely would have. You might as well pay ten dollars for some bondage porn because that's basically what this book is.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a fun game. I am not having any glitches with it. Energy doesn't take long to replenish. Fun way to pass the time. I like it.
B006IYG5HE|3.0|As a lover of Steig Larson books, I had read about Jo Nesbo being the Norweigan equal to Larson.  It was suggested that I read the first translated one of his books, The Redbreast.  I had difficulty following the characters since the names are so foreign to me (like Russian novels) and it took a while to get used to his style of writing.  You will read a few paragraphs about a character and/or an event. Then you start a new paragraph thinking it is the same story and oops, it's not.  It is about another person, place or thing.  No smooth transitions..While Harry Hole is an alcoholic and you wish he would straighten out, one cannot deny his brilliant detective skills.  I did go on and purchase the next two books and have to admit, they got much better. While I still have difficulty following the characters, I am eager to see \\"who did it and why.\\"
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is awesome. It is an adventure game with much decisions to make. I really like the story line of the whole Oregon Trail thing. It really is a very fun and interesting game to play on the kindle fire. I recommend it to everyone.
B0034G4P4O|2.0|I have read all the TinTin 'books' and know the stories and characters.  This rendition crammed too many stories<br />and too many characters into one hyper hectic film leaving this viewer exhausted.  It seems the director and producer<br />sensed they had only this one opportunity so they used a scatter shot.
B0000AUHQT|5.0|The movie was delivered quickly and the seller was great. I've been watching the movie ever since I got it at least twice a week. I just love this movie!!!!
B004HXIZVC|3.0|I like this app but does not work for kindle fire :(((((((((((((((((((((((((((( can u make one for kindle fire please :((((((((((( :(((((((((((((((
B006CAXPSQ|4.0|Carmen, told through the spectacles of Antonia Gades and the Teatro Real Madrid, is a flamenco-and-Spanish-dance re-telling of the famed opera. It provides an interesting look at the culture of flamenco and Spanish dance, with the story being told through song, dance, and mime. There are also several interludes of folk-esque dances and songs for the rest of cast. Accompanying the film is a short documentary about the history of the work of art, and its effect on the dance world. If one were looking for a more balletic adaption of Carmen, I would recommend Petit's Carmen, or Alonso's Carmen. While this film provides an interesting look at flamenco culture, I personally enjoy the more balletic adaptions of this story, so I'd have to recommend the aforementioned ones.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My dog loves it! I love the laugh whhen you win.such a \\"Renfield\\" maniacal! Cant wait to try new games. I find this as addictive as Portal. Ebben mom loves it
B007PTJOV0|5.0|really fun game. started playing and could not putnit down. it is very similar to Mario world. highly recommend playing it for adults or kids
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game! its like frontierville but better. you can do this game with friends or alone you dont need to wait for people to help get items you need
B002N7W3NK|2.0|This is the only album of Diana Krall's , and I have them all, that is a disapointment. I do not have words to discribe the magic of her live performances including a personal presents at a preformance in Las Vegas Hiltons concert hall . This album lacks that magic , maybe one too many , maybe RIO .
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Everyone should read \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\". A real eye opener and very emotional book. I saw a two man play before I read the book. An easy read. Makes a person think about the value of friendship and what an important part Moorie played. We should all be so lucky as to have a Morrie in our lives...
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I was excited to try this app as I like Oregon Trail games. The app never connected to the Internet. I would try several times and even though I had wi-fi, it never cooperated. Uninstalled.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is very fun if you like Mario you will love this game me and my brother love it so fun
B005D51II0|5.0|In the late 1950's, at the dawn of stereophonic recording, several classical record labels embraced the new technology wholeheartedly. At the top of the pack were Decca, Mercury Living Presence, and RCA Living Stereo. Each label had a crew of recording engineers dedicated to using the new stereo recording capability to create state of the art recordings, in anticipation of the forthcoming standardization of stereo LPs for the consumer market, which happened in 1958.<br /><br />This collection spans many years of Decca recordings, from the late 1950's out through the late 2000's, including the transition from analog tape recording to digital. How do the older analog recordings compare to more modern digital recordings? The original performance was captured first on magnetic recording tape, and then transferred to the LP master. Magnetic tape recording has several limitations, compared with today's digital recording. The most important limitations are tape hiss, limited dynamic range, and bad distortion (overmodulation resulting in clipping) that occurs if the incoming audio level is higher than the tape can accommodate. The Decca engineers worked carefully to avoid overmodulation distortion, so the worst you'll hear on these CDs is some residual tape hiss. It's subtle, and doesn't really detract from the overall enjoyment of the sound. In short, even these earlier recordings sound splendid.<br /><br />The diversity of music presented in this collection is impressive. We have early music from 1551, modern composers like Walton, Bartok, and Britten, and everything in between. There's orchestral music, opera, solo piano, and even cabaret songs. Most of the albums are on the Decca label, but Decca's associated labels L'Oiseau Lyre and Argo are also represented.<br /><br />Of course, even with 50 CDs, this collection doesn't come close to covering the entire Decca catalog. But what's here is wonderful, both for Decca fans and also for anyone new to classical music. At roughly $2 per CD, it's a great way to quickly assemble a diverse classical music library. Also check out the equally impressive and bargain priced box sets from [[ASIN:B005XBA9Y8 Mercury Living Presence Boxed Set]] and [[ASIN:B003UCPEJ2 Living Stereo 60 CD Collection Box]].
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|don't really understand the bad reviews?? this is a pretty cool game :-) love it and so do the kids. very entertaining!  ;-)
B0071T5PN0|2.0|I've been a VH fan for many years and enjoy both Dave and Sammy on lead.  I've had this album since it came out and have been trying to give it a chance before posting any sort of review.<br />It pains me to say I don't like this, and mostly because of Roth.  Diamond Dave was a fantastic front man back in the 80's as his high energy level and wacky behavior really worked for the band.  The problem now is that it is many years (many drug/alcohol years) later and Dave just seems to be a bit of a mentally fried cheeseball lounge singer.  It just makes me cringe to listen to him on this album, much to my dismay.  Tattoo is one of the worst songs I've heard... period.  I nearly jumped out of my moving car the first time I heard it.  Listening closely to the song and trying to give it a chance only made it worse for me.<br /><br />Michael Anthony is also missed.  Perhaps that also contributes to my feeling that this album just isn't really complete.<br /><br />On a positive note, many of the songs really do rock like the old (and good) VH of old so that part of the album I do enjoy.  In the end, it isn't quite enough to make up for Dave and the album has pretty much been put out to pasture for me.<br /><br />I wish I was one of the other reviewers here who really loved it but I just can't get there unfortunately.
B0038W0OIK|2.0|I've had a couple of Steelseries products including these and the 5H USB headphones. Sound quality is fantastic. I really love the noise cancelling leather cuffs on the 7H. They do a great job of cutting out external noise and they're more comfortable than the standard foam cuffs. Overall comfort of the headset is excellent as well.<br /><br />Positional sound is exceptional using the USB sound card.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I've gone through 2 sets of them in less than a year. As others have noted, this headset seems to have a problem with one side cutting out after several months of use. Steelseries replaced the first one and now the replacement one has failed with the same issue. For a headset in this price range the lack of durability is unacceptable. I'm done with the 7H and trying to decide if I'm done with Steelseries entirely or if I want to go back to the 5H.<br /><br />Also of note, the mic quality is not high with the 7H. The 5H was acceptable, but my friends noticed a definite difference in the 7H. Sadly, the $40 G330 headset I'm using as a backup has the best mic sound quality of the three.<br /><br />Performance and comfort wise, these would rate a 5. Unfortunately that's no use when an entire side drops out after < 6 months.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|Great app that's always way out of date compared to what's available on the Google market (nee Play market). Five stars for app and usefulness but one star for always being out of date compared to Google.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|so addicting!!! I cant put this game down...<br />I wish gems were easier to come by though... have fun playing!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|having a total blast playing this on my kindle! great graphics and story line! excited to play every time I sit down.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|me likey.<br />wish i could move/delete/rearrange easier. also would be cool to see something besides url for webclips. I bet if I tried some of the icons I could do some of these things
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is an awesome ap. it has tons of games to unlock.  they can be easy or really challenging.  get it on a kindle or an aneroid. I liv it!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great app. everyone knows about angry birds. But whats even better its free. I would highly recommend getting the app.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|In the first Oregon Trail game, you get from New England to Oregon by using common sence, skill, and luck.  This pretty much sums up what happened once you got to the west! It is pretty much like pet shop story or one of those FaceBook games. You collect coins and kill wild animals to get food for your shops. It's a pretty fun game to see if you like it
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great activity! It kept my brain thinking trying to find the best way to solve the puzzle. Please make more puzzles!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is the free solitaire app for Kindle. It would be an okay game for solitaire lover's. There are lots of ads so just if you like solitaire, get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a great game . It is pretty much like Mario Brothers. The best part is that it is free.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is almost EXACTLY like Super Mario Bros!! Since there isn't any SMB app on any device, this is the perfect game! You start out when all of Lep's gold is gone and you have to find it and get coins. If you love SMB, you will love leps world!  This is a must have app for everyone.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|Like other buyers, this product worked perfect the first time. Then the problems began. First, the recording of the second side of my cassette was distorted. Then my iMac was unable to read the device. So, I tried plugging it into my PC laptop. Kept getting an error message. So, I am going to try to return it.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Its super awesome. don't listen to any of the haters. works perfectly on my kindle fire. I'm really glad its free.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love this app so much I click download as video and it puts it on my gallery its a must just get it now to save you the I am in love with just get get get it it it and its freeeeee
B0055SWM08|5.0|if you like puzzle games like where's my water or cut the rope, you will like this game. I recommend.
B004J09ONG|5.0|A very touching story. The film made it so  real.<br />I was keeping thinking how was it filmed.<br />highly recommend
B0060Q962Q|4.0|I did enjoy playing this old-fashioned game.  I had to re-format my phone, and now I cannot reload this app.  No idea on what to do next.  Help, anyone?
1451627289|5.0|I received this book as a Christmas gift and read it every single day until I finished it.  11/22/63 is the first Stephen King book I have read and now I look forward to reading everything by him.  Anybody who wants to experience (or re-experience) life in 50s style America should grab this book.
B004JN1D2I|2.0|*This review is about the price not the books which I've heard are amazing*<br /><br />I went to order this set yesterday and it was 18 dollars.  Came online today and it's 34.. Can't say I'm impressed with the dramatic price jump.  I've seen the same set on sony and kobo for 29 so I'd recommend getting it elsewhere.
B0055SWM08|5.0|It has many levels, looks nice and I like the soundtrack. Got it while it was free, but would definitely buy.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Good time passer. Works your brain. Its a good activity to keep your mind sharp. A little boring after a while though...
B0055SWM08|4.0|The game works your mind, but is also strangely relaxing. The music and graphics are great. I like all the different tricks and challenges!
0345803485|5.0|I'm a fan fiction write and fan. Reading this book, knowing it began as a Twilight Saga fan fiction, made me love it all the more. I knew who each character was supposed to be and I loved it.<br /><br />Not being squeamish at all, I enjoyed the hell out of this book. I'm not easily offended and a good read isn't always literary perfection.<br /><br />If you love fan fiction, mature books, hot romance or BDSM, this book is a must read.<br /><br />\\"Mommy Porn\\"? Maybe, but ask me if I care.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|one of the best written books i have read i am now on book number two i am just enjoying the story line so much can't wait to read the third one to see how finally Christian overcomes his demons
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Fun and interesting and like Mario but different enough to keep me interested. I look forward to free updates and support for a good game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love that there are multiple games all in one app that you can play. great for people who want a game to play until its beat.
B003WWZ1R0|5.0|Picked this up on a whim at Earthbound Trading- and it is THE BEST cd I ever bought! We listen to it a lot in our massage therapy class and it is the most relaxing, soothing, and peaceful music we have had.... i will never let this cd go! My teacher ran out and got her own copy the same weekend i brought it in and everyone in our diverse class is in love with it! It is a MUST HAVE! :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Not only is this a great Bible app for reading that is easy to navigate through, with every translation I can imagine.... the best thing is the reading plans. Awesome app. I use it multiple times every day.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this app.  Its fun,  addictive,  and exciting.  Give it a chance you won't be sorry. I know I'm having a good time with it!
0439023513|4.0|well writen and exciting, carried on with the two previous books. Just not sure I was happy with the ending.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I really liked this book. I loved the dynamic of the characters and just when you thought you had the characters figured out the author gave us another unexpected twist. I found myself asking out loud why Abby would do such things, but to me that just means I got wrapped into the story. Isn't that what makes it a good book?<br /><br />I don't quite understand the bad reviews and the \\"lesson this book is supposed to teach girls\\". This is just a story and a good one too. A different one as it is not the perfect guy and the perfect girl who have perfect relationship and a happily ever after. Abby and Travis both have faults, making their relationship a roller coaster. I hope you enjoy the ride just as much as I did.
0439023491|4.0|after reading the first book could not wait to read them all. Was not as excited about this one but it was still pretty good
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Maybe the best show ever by Madonna, together with the Drowned world tour and the Who's that girl tour. Just one word: fantastic. If you watch carefully you will understand all the symbolism and all the reasons behind every single performance. Wonderful Live to Tell on the Cross.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its fun. I don't like that you have to earn coins. Other than that, I really like the game. :)
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|I understand all the critics to this album because I shared them for a longtime. But now I really like this album, it is very pleasant and still so much better than most of the music that's produced today. This album is funky, fun, pleasant and makes you feel like dancing. Of course it depends on what you're looking for in a Madonna album. If you prefer other aspects of HER MAJESTY, you can listen to Ray of Light or Music or American Life. This is something else, this is Hard Candy.<br />Highlights: Candy shop, very Prince. She's not me: fantastic funky guitar. Devil: very beautiful ballad. Voices: I adore this Madonna, sort of epic. Miles away: an instant classic.<br />Horrible Spanish Lesson! Forget it and you will appreciate this album more.
075640407X|5.0|I'm going to start with the good things about this book and move on to the bad things later on in the review. First off: Patrick Rothfuss uses literary elements to make his book likeable and readable. He uses humor, which is nearly on every page, satire, and many other things which make you feel that he really tries to create a realistic world for the reader to experience. The characters that Rothfuss creates are intelligent, and amazingly pieced together. Kvothe is one example. He is witty, funny, but arrogant. This is one of the things I like about his writing: He never creates a perfect character for his story. Second of all, his story makes sense, unlike many other books I have read that have unpronounceable page-long character names that are confusing and needless. Rothfuss keeps his names short and memorable. Now, moving on to the bad things. The storyline is nearly perfect, with the exception of a few flaws. It seems like Rothfuss is actually stalling during Kvothe's time at the University. Let me clarify: the author tells minor, unimportant things that happen to Kvothe while he's at the University. It seems as though Rothfuss was creating those minor events until he could think of a more important event to happen to Kvothe. I may be wrong, and it could be part of his writing style, but it seems like he's stalling. Secondly, Rothfuss takes a very long time to actually convey what he's thinking. It seems to me that he could have created a much shorter book if he just explained what he meant. With those few bad things, there are many innumerable good things about the books which I will not name for the sake of those of you who have not read the book. I am giving this 5 stars because of those good things. If you are a patient person, and I mean VERY patient, then you will absolutely love this book, bad things and good things.
B00122BEYG|5.0|This album is simply one of the best by Madonna. You may not like it at first because it hasn't the \\"classic\\" 90's sound, but this is a new classic: Music, I deserve it, Gone, Don't tell me...Electronic, pop, danceable, deep, atmospheric. It tries to separate from Ray of light and finds its own new identity. A great Madonna album.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a very enjoyable game to play. The scenarios are fun the graphics are wonderful.  All in all a good game.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|it is fun but is a replica of Mario so it cant be as good as the original it is fun though
B004UXUX4Q|1.0|This was a terrible movie.  Selfish.  Bleak.  Foul.  Proud.  Eternally Hopeless.  Unrespecting of Life.  Over-acted.  It just wasn't a good movie.<br /><br />The movie begins with Elizabeth, the hated woman of the movie, water skiing, and ending up in a coma at a Hawaiian hospital on life support.  The whole movie (which is supposedly about an impending land deal) really revolves around the dying woman's broken relationships with her family.  Her husband walks into the hospital room and rails on his pitiful-looking, dying wife for the awful life she gave him, in the most foul-mouthed sort of way.  Her older daughter (who is usually shown in the movie either in a bikini, using the F word all the time, or in short shorts and tight T-shirts) arrives and does the same thing.  Near the end of the movie, an ex-lover's wife (Judy Greer) comes in and spews out \\"I forgive you\\" over and over, yelling ...\\"because I have to!\\".  The movie ends with Elizabeth's family spreading her ashes in the ocean from a kayak, and George Clooney saying, \\"Well, that's that.\\"  Then, he and his two daughters watch a movie together and share 2 bowls of ice cream--family bonding, you know, after all they've been through--life is good now that mom's not messing up their self-absorbed lives.<br />The few parts about the land deal are so inconsequential compared to the time spent on the broken family and how they hate their wife/mother.  Selfish and shallow.
0545265355|5.0|Got the books in a few days and was done the first one in 4 hours.  Great deal for the money.
B0055SWM08|4.0|this game has nice, calm music, brain teasing puzzles, a little laggy and controls sometimes take repeat requests but ultimately enjoyable on the DROID bionic
0553801473|4.0|Its been a year since I finished Book 4 so it took a bit of memory jogging to remember where we last left off at and while I thought it was a good book it was just too *long*.  GRRM could have lopped off half these chapters and been left with a great book instead of an ok one.<br /><br />I cannot add much more to the conversation as others have before me but its really not as bad as the 1-2 star reviews suggest.  Is/was 8 years to long before this book? Yes, it was.  Has GRRM introduced so many characters (I especially did not like the indifferent chapter titles) as to make the reader angry with the constant POV changes? Yes but still at the end of the day I found myself saying WOW and contemplating what I had just read.<br /><br />Please just dont keep us waiting.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love it! totally addicted! I could sit and play this game for hours! and I do! makes me feel like a kid again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I THINK THIS BOOK IS GREATER THAN THE FIRST ONE,I HAD A IDEA AND AN IMAGE OF WHAT I WAS READING,PERFECT WORDS TO AN INCREDIBLE STORY
B00000IL67|5.0|If you really want the complete best of AC ...you have to buy just a few original albums also but this set is 80% of his best.You really need all his 1970s complete albums to have all his best.Especially ..School's out...billion dollar babies,...welcome to my nightmare....Lace and whiskey.This set is great for everything else you need.I met and talked with Alice Cooper and He is a fine Man who turned his life around.He is not demonic ,he is a christian.His stage show is only acting.Ho told me he would love to perform without all the theatrics but his fans want it.Just plain great written fun music from Alice.

B003K16P3M|3.0|I'm just gonna jump right into it. I didn't hate this book, but I didn't love it either.<br /><br />I had a hard time pinning down what kind of person Katsa was, I didn't understand her personality; we're TOLD that she didn't want to do the King's dirty work, threatening and hurting people who displeased him, but I never FELT like she was all that bothered by it. On one hand she is saying she doesn't want to harm a man who is defying the King by protecting his daughters, while on the other hand she sees a little girl who is Graced with mind reading and she says she wants to kill her simply because of what her Grace is. ...What? We are TOLD she started an underground organization that helps people (like the mission she goes on in the beginning of the book to save the elderly prince of a neighboring kingdom who has been kidnapped), but she never really seems to CARE about anyone so it feels off that she would go through the trouble to help others.<br /><br />Katsa is also completely invincible. She never truly faces any challenges in the book because she can survive anything. She can not only fight and kill anything, but she can also command herself to sleep for specific amounts of time, but not that she needs much sleep anyway, or food or water for that matter, and she can withstand extreme temperatures with little clothing, etc etc; she can do anything and it makes her extremely flat and hard to care about.<br /><br />The love story fell short and had no real conclusion because of Katsa's random decision to never marry. Prince Po confesses his love for her and she seems devastated that she loves him too because she has declared, for no real reason, that she will never marry. So Po lets her know that he will take her any way he can have her, and they continue on their journey as a couple. You think Katsa will grow throughtout their adventure and realize that being married to the right person shouldn't change who you are (which is the only reason she offers to being so opposed to marriage), or at least not change you in a negative way, but she never does, no character growth happens, she doesn't develop a personality and you don't really learn anything about her or any of the other characters.<br /><br />I'm not anyone who believes completely in the importance of marriage or anything like that, but in this instance, it just seemed like the fact she wouldn't marry the man she was supposed to love took away from the story. They didn't necessarily need to get married or engaged, but marriage just could have not been brought up at all. There are plenty of good love stories that don't end in marriage, but the characters are together and you feel closure and like the relationship wasn't a waste of time. When Katsa states that she won't marry Po because it would make her seem 'clingy' and that she didn't want to weigh him down in case he wanted to find someone else to love made me so confused. What a weird thing to think. It was a WTF moment if I ever saw one.<br /><br />All that said, it wasn't the worst book I've ever read, and if you have $7 (Kindle edition) you wanna get rid of, it will occupy you for a day or two and you won't feel completely let down, but you won't feel fulfilled either. Sort of like when a relative or friend tells a mildly amusing story, then you go back to your life.
B007RV6X2Y|1.0|This movie was awful.  Those expecting Jules of Pulp Fiction Days or  Carl Lee Hailey in a Time to Kill or even Lazarus from Black Snake Moan will be sorely disappointed.  Sam, sometimes I cram to understand why is it quantity over quality with you?  Yes, you are the hardest working man in Hollywood but you don't have to do every damn movie that comes your way.  The Samaritan's plodding,  meandering storyline with improbable/illogical plot points does not hold anything to the film noir of yesteryear.  The only twist(spoiler alert) was incest and that was played for cheap effect.  Do not pay 9.99 or even 13.50(if you live in NYC) to see this movie.  I wonder if Sam might have dropped a bit from  the 1%  in having to do movies like this.  Sam,  your agent ran the grift on you when he passed this script along, Sam's agent, Elan Mastai and David Weaver grifted you, lastly folks out there-don't let them or this movie grift you.
B006YXTRHY|3.0|As a lonely middle aged man with no social life, when I sit down to watch a sexy vampire flick with a glass of chardonnay, a plate of low-sodium fat-free water crackers, and two boxes of moisturizing tissues, I expect more than leaden angst wrapped in fur and amber contact lenses. Perhaps this should be renamed to Twilight: Breaking Hymn (did I spell that correctly? *cough*), since it was a naughty song of love. The moon through yonder window did break, and its light in and out of the window did shine, all night long, until the bird cried out in the morning, &quot;coo! coo!&quot; And if you think that's hot, then you'll thrill to the glacial pacing of this epic nuptial that remains frozen in time, like Edward's icy and tumescent love for Bella.

0062502182|1.0|Why does Amazon gouge customers for charging $3.53 more for a Kindle copy than the cost of a paperback?  The paperback must be sent up electronicaly to print.  This is a no Brainer or is Amazon following in the steps of Apple , the I-POD and the three book publishers to increase the prices?

B002MQYOFW|3.0|Very well written and Suzanne Collins is quite a story-teller.  However, I found the story very depressing, albeit morality-driven.  Could not go beyond the first 3 chapters in book 2.  I can only hope parents of teenagers read this series and explain to their children.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book started out slow at first and then it just hit me, and I could not stop reading this book. I am so excited about the other two books in the triology.  I loved the story line, Christian's secret and his many more to come.  Ordinary girl, meets sexy rich man, and Love is going to overrule all the bad in Christian.  Annastatia is the girl next door, and is on a mission, to have her dream man.  I loved this book, and actually re-reading this book again, until, the other books come in.  Recommended read!!

0439023491|3.0|SPOILERS<br /><br />What happens after Katniss and Peeta win the Hunger Games and return home? For me I felt the only way forward was for the two of them to begin or join a rebellion that leads to overthrowing the Capitol and the totalitarian regime that created the Hunger Games. And it seems that Suzanne Collins' thinking is along those same lines too except she only gets to the rebellion until the final few pages of the book.<br /><br />In the meanwhile she has Katniss and Peeta do a victory tour of all 12 Districts (this takes up the first 100 pages), then Katniss spends a lot of a time thinking about the love triangle she's in with Peeta and Gale (yawn), which goes on for another 100 pages with a glimpse into the next book's destination, District 13, where the rebels are based, before plunging back into tedious non-action until the Capitol announces all previous Hunger Games winners are to be pitted against each other in another Games. So Collins spends nearly 300 pages treading water, going over the events of the first book, what little that goes on in this book, until Katniss and Peeta wind up in the arena again.<br /><br />It took me two sittings to read the first book, I was so enthralled by it, and nearly two weeks to complete &#34;Catching Fire&#34;. The Games twist in this book is that it's not just kids in the games but adult and old people but because Katniss has a team to support her, the Games this time around are less interesting and are mostly the characters reacting to the environment.<br /><br />The path to rebellion is finally picked up at the end but it took an entire book (the longest in the trilogy) to get there and, looking back on it, I don't think it needed to be even half as long as this was. It could've easily been a much shorter book and then split between &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; and &#34;Mockingjay&#34;, but then trilogies are all the rage aren't they?<br /><br />&#34;Catching Fire&#34; is a disappointing second novel with some nice moments that are few and far between though with a satisfying finale that sets up the third and final novel nicely. I hope &#34;Mockingjay&#34; is awesome because &#34;Catching Fire&#34; sure wasn't.moments that are few and far between though with a satisfying finale that sets up the third and final novel nicely.

B0002A2WDQ|4.0|Unfortunately, in this excellent movie the main character states that it was Eric Clapton who revitalized the song entitled Crossroads.  Crossroads was covered by the band Cream in their great 1967 album Wheels of Fire.  Eric Clapton was the gifted lead guitarist of Cream.  But it was Jack Bruce, singer, songwriter and bass player who was the leader and driving force behind the band.  Jack Bruce is the one who should have been mentioned in the movie, not Eric Clapton.  Cream was a great band that also featured Ginger Baker, another rock legend on drums.  Another supergroup of the same era, Led Zeppelin used Robert Johnson's lyrics in their track entitled The Lemon Song but they did not give Johnson credit.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Reading the second book in the hunger game series left me wanting more. Very detailed and can imagine being right in the middle of the districts. A lot of twists and turns that are unexpected. I immediately had to finish the series because I was left wanting more.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|While utilizing elements from a well known game it still manages to be fun and engaging. I purchased for free so the price can't be beat.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The third book in a wonderful series. I loved, loved, loved these books. I wish it had of continue on. With everything in the books being so detailed and full of unexpected twists and turns, the ending stopped kinda ubruptly but it left no questions in my mind. Very well written and good read.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This seems like a perfect game for those of us who are not into fast-and-furious games.  The graphics are pleasantly soft and artistic. The game itself can be a challenge to figure out, and then another challenge to perfect. Nice way to relax for a while!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very well written book. I couldn't put it down. A love story entwinded in the struggles of a society. A lot of detail in the book which gave me my own impressions of what the characters and setting look like. Not sure if I want to see the movie now or not.
B0078Q2HAA|3.0|I love biographical movies and enjoy Meryl Streep's work. She certainly lives up to the Academy Award she received for her performance, but the overall movie was not nearly as good as I expected it to be. There is too much about Margaret Thatcher as an elderly woman, after she was no longer Prime Minister, and not nearly enough of her while she was in office. The plot was not very good, and the overall experience was a disappointment.
B00756GKBA|5.0|I'll keep it short. Madonna is STILL the Queen! There is nothing wrong with this album! It's fun, emotional, catchy, and full of flavor! The songs about her divorce are the highlights here: \\"Gang Bang\\", \\"Love Spent\\", \\"I Don't Give A\\", \\"Falling Free\\", \\"Best Friend\\" and \\"I F-ed Up\\". The banjo, the strings, and the beat on \\"Love Spent\\" is pure genius! That song moves me to tears. \\"Gang Bang\\" is the most experimental song on \\"MDNA\\". It's violent, dark, and corrupt! There are some great dance songs too such as: \\"Girl Gone Wild\\", \\"I'm Addicted\\" and \\"Some Girls\\". I think Madonna's voice sounds amazing on \\"Turn Up the Radio\\" and \\"Masterpiece\\" - the way she emotes is priceless. Every song has a great hook and melody, no filler here! Don't listen to the haters, Madonna is back and better than ever!!! Even \\"B-Day Song\\" makes me smile, so cute!
B004EPYZQ2|3.0|I wanted to like this b/c I like Abrams & Spielberg. The movie was just ok for me, I wouldn't buy it. It's like a modern day E.T.

B0034G4P4Y|5.0|I didnt know much about tin tin, are they books? I rented this for my kids and was impressed by the story, may buy (on BD) when the price drops. I'd say this isn't for real little ones, maybe a lil older like 8-11 range. It's Sherlock Holmes for kids. Great animation. I'd recommend it

My kids didn't really know who the Muppets were, as they're not on TV anymore. I would say this film is more for younger kids. BTW, my fave character is Beaker. Meep. It's not a great movie, but it's entertaining for the kiddos, some songs, dancing, etc

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This game was really fun until there was a weird glitch that made me have to wait 288 hours before I could collect from my crops, buildings, and animals. Also, today everything I touched was unresponsive.  Lastly, I cannot visit anyone in the social section,  trying to do so makes my kindle force close. After all that,  I uninstalled the app. Such a shame, because I really liked it. I hope they fix these glitches soon.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|This game kept me entertained for a long time. I didn't want to put it down.  It was easy to follow along.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is so awesome and addicting! Its like Mario but its still really fun. I like how its like Mario but a little different like you cant get power ups but you can pick up pine cones to through. I reccomend to the classic Mario and Sonic fans.
B006BG7RI0|4.0|First, I'm not reviewing the movie, which in and of itself is worth 10 stars.  Yes, it follows \\"Citizen Kane\\" as the second-best movie of all time.  But it's probably the best overall and most enjoyable movie ever made.  So enough about what we already know...<br /><br />Second, with a couple of exceptions, I'm not really reviewing the quality, quantity, or variety of extras in this special edition as a reason to purchase or not to purchase this movie.  It's got some cool souvenirs, extras, etc.  Some of the extras I watched appear to have been re-mastered vs. the 2008/2009 edition they were in.  In that edition, the extras look as though they were poorly upscaled from the DVD version.  The extras on this edition seem to be of better quality, and the menus are a bit more refined.<br /><br />What I am reviewing is the quality of this transfer vs. the 2008/2009 Blu-Ray edition of the movie.  Sadly, I think the 2008/2009 edition is superior, both for the video and the audio.  Let me start by saying I watched all versions on an HDTV and on a newer 1920x1080 Dell laptop with the appropriate player software.  For the heck of it, I also took an HD recording off TCM, as well as a TCM standard DVD because I could not really believe what I was seeing, or rather, not seeing, with this edition.  The problem with this edition is that the contrast/gamma is off.  Way off, at least on my monitors, relative to the 2008/2009 edition Blu-Ray and DVD, and the TCM HD airing.  While the other versions seem to have no problem with grays, this edition contains too much black.  I had to create a custom setting on my monitor to expand the gamma.  When I went back to other shows, they were far too bright and washed out, so I don't think it's in my monitor or laptop.  And yes, I can watch the TCM edition on my laptop via SageTV.  This leads me to believe one of two things is going on - either \\"Casablanca\\" has been transferred incorrectly all along, and this edition finally got it right, or this edition has a problem with its transfer.  I think it's the latter.  The gamma is just plain too low.  Things are either too black, lost in the shadows, or too white.  The good news is, relative to the 2008/2009 Blu Ray edition, the resolution appears even higher and more detailed.  The grain of the film is so apparent it almost hurts your eyes, in a good way.  Needless to say, either edition beats the TCM HD airing in that department, as one would expect with the lower bitrate of satellite TV.  Obviously, they also beat the standard DVD, but not by as much as one might think.  I take issue with the contrast/gamma so much because of the important use of shadow, both with the characters' faces and costumes, and with the backgrounds, to convey emotional states and atmosphere.  It's not solely because the detailing on someone's top or sleeve gets lost due poor contrast/gamma, although that is almost as bad.<br /><br />The other issue is the audio.  It's not that I expect surround; I never did from any edition.  The problem is that the movie starts out loud and then gets softer.  It's the same with dialogue normalization engaged or disengaged in my players/monitors.  I was hoping that since the movie was in mono, and not being listened to with the expectation of a surround-sound festival, that I could correct the steadily-dropping level by using normalization and not destroy dynamic range that was never there to begin with.  Unfortunately, that did not help either.  Again, neither the 2008/2009 blu Ray or TCM DVD editions, or the TCM HD airing suffered from this, so I don't think it's my systems' fault.<br /><br />Am I saying not to buy this movie?  No, I am not.  Casablanca is hands-down my favorite movie.  But at $45 for this edition, I think one should be prepared for what one might or might not get.  Maybe it's my monitor and laptop.  I doubt it's both, especially with three other versions to compare it to.  If you think I may be right, rent the last release and watch them both and decide for yourself.<br /><br />As to the extras, the ones I have watched so far look as though they have been at least re-scanned in HD, even if their aspect ratios are not right when showing clips of the movie within them.  I also recommend listening to Ebert's commentary at least one time while viewing the movie.  He makes some great points about the composition of the movie itself and offers some compelling arguments against the popular \\"Casablanca\\" urban legends such as Bergman's alleged confusion about not knowing the eventual outcome of her character (aside from the order of the shooting, as an actress she had to know all along that her character could never go off with Bogart's character since her character was married and the film censors of the time would never have allowed her character to leave her husband for another single man in the movie).  Details such as those might cause you to look further into the fascinating story of how this movie came to be so highly regarded, when in reality no one at the time expected it to be anythig more than one of the 50 or so movies Warner Brothers would make that year.<br /><br />****Update****<br /><br />Just for the heck of it, I purchased a used HD DVD copy as well. My above criticisms against this 70th. Edition would also stand as compared to the HD-DVD transfer.  It also has much better contrast/gamma, but I still have to give a slight edge to the 70th. Edition for the detail.  As I stated earlier, the resolution of the 70th. Edition is so good at revealing the grain of the film that it almost hurts to look at it.

1451648537|4.0|This was a very enjoyable read, giving a nice behind the scenes look at both Apple and Steve Jobs.  Well done.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I bought this because of a review I read in the newspaper.  Even so I wasn't really prepared for actual sexual content.  If you aren't comfortable with scenes of dominant/submissive sex,and a lot of more vanilla sex scenes, you won't like the book.  Its a rather predictable romance novel with a sexual twist.  Makes for a good naughty escapism read.  I guess I also learned a bit about a world I was totally unfamiliar with.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|Amazing how the technology today can convert such an old movie to such a modern perfect picture.  will continue to purchase more old time movies.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Nice game, but I get a little annoyed with developers who ask for feedback from a screen or pop-up right in the game.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Pretty fun game to keep you occupied.  You have to have a bit of patience however; be a little crafty and a good hunter.

B000G6R7B8|1.0|I purchased this sports watch to wear on hikes, around town, etc.  It doesn't get any hard use.  Right after I got it, I was in a field during photography and someone found the watch on the ground with one pin pulled out.  I wrote to the seller and received back a computer generated note that basically said \\"we are going to doing nothing to help you.\\"  I took it to an excellent watch maker and the had to completely reconfigure the watch band and customize new pins because even after replacing the pins with different types, any pull on the watch band would make it fall apart.  I now have $20 invested in a brand new watch for a total of $115.00.<br /><br />The jeweler said the band was causing the problem.  I liked the band at first...it is made of a canvas material which will absorb moisture in the hot weather and it is easy to buckle.<br /><br />The other problem is that if you have more than one watch and you switch back and forth, it will stop working given that it needs movement to self wind.  In 24 hours it will stop and you will have to reset the time and the date, which is a pain.  The watch is very thick, which precluded you from buttoning a long sleeve shirt.<br /><br />Mine also kept very poor time.  I was having to reset it daily.<br /><br />If you want to waste your money on a poorly designed watch, this one is for you!  The seller is operating at the same poor level as the watch....they are a good match.

B0029LHX1W|5.0|This story is a great (fictional) insight into the conditions and operation of the government in post war Russia. This story paints a human story on these conditions which are only generically referred to in contemporary times.<br /><br />After reading the story I felt like a lot of the \\"spoils\\" people in America have are taken for granted. Freedom, food, living conditions, rights etc. I see the epidemic of obesity in the US and think about kids and families eating rats, chewing on bark-very sad. I'm sure it's similar for some today in third world countries.<br /><br />The underlying crime/drama is well written and comes full circle in a somewhat predictable fashion closer to the end. Overall I enjoyed this book a great deal and would look for other titles by this author.<br /><br />It was a cheap date find at Goodwill for under $4 too.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I first heard of the \\"Fifty Shades trilogy\\" on GMA and figured I'd try them out to see what all the fuss was about.  I soon became an addict!  I read the first book in less than a day, got the second and read it in about a day, then got the third and finished it in about the same time.  I've since read them all twice over.  I absolutely love this author and these books!  The author does such an amazing job at describing things so that you feel like you've lived the events, or at the very least just seen an incredibly realistic movie.  I've already got all of my friends reading the trilogy and so far all very enthusiastic positive reviews!
B002RVZV9K|5.0|I am a huge fan of Jimmy Page and Jack White so I was so excited to see the both of them along with the Edge in this documentary. Getting to know the men more and their personal histories was really a treat and the music, especially from Mr. Page was phenomenal.

0553801473|5.0|I just finished A Dance with Dragons and the first thing I said when I did was \\"He has got to finish this series\\" I started reading this series after watching the first episode of the series on HBO.  I have fallen in love with the characters and I am a fan of the writing style and the way that while reading \\"Game of Thrones\\" I felt like I was being beckoned into a world that I felt a kinship to.  It's all very Machiavellian the style of these books, everyone is striving to end up on top, and the people who are not trying to win end up being crushed under foot.  In this book I found that the characters that I have come to care about, are being drawn to a precipice and they will end up on the winning side or the losing side.  There were new characters including a unforeseen player in this game that for all intents and purposes has been hiding in the wings of this story waiting to come out and change the game.  I want to say that I understand that some people are particularly fond of the time that it takes for these books to come out but to be honest, no fantasy series since \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" has completely pulled me into the mind of the writer.  Tyrion is at his best being a man who is underestimated but always manages to come out on top, Cersi is down but I don't think for the count.  The 'spider' is up to his old tricks because like Tyrion he is underestimated.  It's still anyone's game, but who will win and who will die?
0553386794|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a book so much since Brandon Sanderson's Way of Kings. These two books have much in common--exhilarating plotting, well-drawn characters, and authors who write in a such a way that you never want to stop reading. Martin does an excellent job of keeping you interested and invested in characters widely separated by geography and dilemmas. While he shifts focus from one primary character to another, he does in so expertly that it doesn't feel disjointed at all, much like Sanderson did in the Way of Kings. There are differences between the two books. Chief among them for me is that Sanderson employs magical and fantastical things to a much greater degree that Martin. Also, with Martin, no character is safe. Whether a character is good or bad, or major of minor, no are safe from the sword. I like this realism. I look forward to reading the remainder of the Ice and Fire series. I haven't watched the HBO series, so I can't say as to how much the television series follows the book, but Martin has certainly given them a spellbinding story to work with.
B004EPYZXK|2.0|Yet another \\"found footage\\" genre movie, \\"Apollo 18\\" with its intriguing premise about the cancelled Apollo 18 mission has potential for a better sci-fi thriller. Co-produced by Timur Bekmambetov (\\"Night Watch\\" \\"Wanted\\"), the mocumentary tells the story of three astronauts and their \\"top secret\\" mission on the moon in the \\"Paranormal Activity\\" fashion, but the end result is a dull and thrill-less 86-minute ride.<br /><br />Those who are expecting something intelligent like \\"Forbidden Planet\\" or, more recently, \\"Moon\\" will be disappointed with how the film, of which opening is surely promising, quickly turns into a series of set-pieces that are unimaginative and predictable, heavily dependent on cheap fright techniques. Directed by Gonzalo Lopez-Gallego, \\"Apollo 18\\" is visually impressive, with footage that looks authentic, but its storytelling is just boring.<br /><br />The film needs someone like Duncan Jones, who knows how to grab our attention by effectively developing the film's original concept, or perhaps a more conventional narrative style that does not rely on frequent POV shots.
B00756GKBA|5.0|MDNA is a 180° turn from Madonna's lacklustre 2008 effort Hard Candy. MDNA is a daring effort full of character and spunk, not to mention good pop. While no Ray of Light or Confessions on a Dance Floor, it is a solid record.<br /><br />Madonna actually has something to say here. MDNA has a recurring theme of self-discovery and bravery, as well as love (whether happy or bitter). \\"Give Me All Your Luvin'\\", the album's first single, is fun and fresh, and the cheerleader chants are creative and add to the track's enjoyment (unlike off-hand contributions on songs on Hardy Candy). While MDNA, like Hard Candy, sounds fully-produced and even has some rap interludes (by women, incidentally), here they actually support the songs in question and their themes, unlike the sea of vacuity that was Hard Candy.<br /><br />\\"Give Me All Your Luvin'\\" is not representative of the whole album, though. There is hardly a dud track on MDNA. \\"Gang Bang\\" is even more amazingly aggressive and out-there than its title suggests, but if you are gonna go with the title for what it's about, be prepared for a pleasant surprise. \\"Turn Up the Radio\\" is a pleasant grower, and \\"I'm a Sinner\\" is a soul-searching track with quite unabashed lyrics. There's even the song \\"Masterpiece\\" from Madonna's film W.E., which I never appreciated as a song until I heard it on here.<br /><br />One of the biggest surprises is the album's closer, \\"Falling Free\\", which is totally free of percussion and instead focuses on being a soaring, emotional song, an interesting way to close a very high-charged record.<br /><br />This is only scraping the gist of it. On MDNA, where there is not wonderful introspection, there is an excellent layering of hooks and melodies. If you were as disappointed in Hard Candy as me, then MDNA is even more of a reason to rejoice. Madonna has found her voice again, and she has a story to tell and she tells it with gusto.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|I found myself to be absolutely riveted with the first two hunger games books but I found this one to drag along a lot, not quite the ending I was expecting and the epilogue seemed to just be tacked on to make the teenage girls reading happy... Don't get me wrong I loved the book, but it isn't on the same level as the first two.
B000000WHC|5.0|Gary Moore is a talent sadly missed. His return to the blues from his rocking days with Thin Lizzy is highlighted in this CD. How can anyone not be touched by his classic \\"Still got the blues for you\\".<br /><br />Mr. Moore once joked his guitar playing coninued for 4 minutes after the song ended. This is a CD filled with the lush sounds he wrings from his Les Paul. His sustain is amazing and his solos are hypnotic as well as legendary.<br /><br />I highly recommend this!
B0073XORLU|5.0|I had initially posted this review stating that the MP3 version was missing 4 tracks, but helpful user Jim K. pointed out that several titles are doubled up in the MP3 listings.
B005LJK3AC|1.0|Good concept...  poorly executed.  It had a few moments but just seemed to drone on and on with the 'horrible boss' scenario.  Either kill them or get on with your lives ...I wish I had.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I now cant wait till part 2 comes out..... I luv The Twilight Saga.... I recommend this series to everyone :)
B0071MV540|1.0|It could be retitled to the \\"hour\\" heist... as that is what it will waste of your time watching it.  A great cast of characters thrown on the screen, shaken up and boringly paraded around. ah well...
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good fun. pretty addicting. wish it was completely free. maybe not hard enough. quests don't seem to reward cash which would be nice to get items
B007MJSQSK|5.0|Nice animation... good story that fit nicely into the 'movie' time format.  The story characters are close to what I remember reading as a kid.  I can't wait for the continued adventures of...
B0055SWM08|5.0|The puzzles are short, but quickly become challenging; before you know it, you've wasted an hour playing this game. I got this free when it was the featured app, but I'd say this is definitely worth spending a buck or two.
B007OUFESC|3.0|The reviews seem to be focused on Jung and Freud. Whereas Sabina appears to be the star ...as she evolved both their theories - as an active recipient of Jung's psychoanalysis and a participant in his work.  Her 'erotic' interaction with Jung seemed a bit over the top - of course it did spice up the movie.  It would have been interesting to have more details of the conversations between Jung and Freud, but the movie paradigm typically limits us to under 2 hours.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a really fun game. I start playing, then realize an hour had flown by. I would totally recommend this game to others.
B007P3TMW2|5.0|Add this one to the list of Tom Hanks movies - he hasn't let me down yet.  Very interesting story line ...and DON't forget Max von Sydow.  His role as the boy's 'helper' makes the movie that much more poignant.
B004EERGHS|4.0|While I agree with others that it needs a better restoration, I will say that this movie stands the tests of time.  It's a classic for a reason, and always will be a classic.
B004A7OQKY|1.0|I would not recommend this video for purchase.  The quality is sub-par, little time was invested into editing (home video style).  The exercises are elementary, nothing original, and could be obtained from free videos uploaded onto YouTube. In my opinion, this video should be priced at $1-2 for purchase. I regret purchasing this video.
B00785P2QC|3.0|wish. had. more options to play with out purchase need more options and if have to purchase should have full diclosure
B0055SWM08|4.0|Quell is compelling in both the look and feel of game-play, and intriguingly unique among the vast array of noisy, manically-paced games that is the norm.
0345803485|2.0|Ana is Bella. Christian  is Edward. This is no \\"Story of O\\". A dom would never tolerate Ana's behavior. I aleady see the casting in the movie. Jennifer Lawrence or Ellen Page  as Ana. Garrett Hedlund as Christian.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|enjoying this game...my only draw back from giving 5 stars is the pressure to get more friends in order to play longer and get more things
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game! its so much fun and very easy to follow. I just wish the energy would fill quicker! haha :)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I like this game because its fun and the little guy always makes me in a good mood ha ha
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun game to play while standing in line.  The music is pretty nice too kinda reminds me of the type of music spas.
B0074ALZ7Q|5.0|This book, in my opinion, is the best book of Daphne Du Maurier. I have already read it about 25 years ago (in a printed format) and now decided to read it again. The characters in the book have been described as if you live amongst them, and the drama and secrets around it are amazingly constructed. Highly recommended reading!
B000O8OTNC|3.0|This tool arrived quickly from amazon and packaged as new.  It is compact and perfect for pocket.  The sharpening ability is however poor quality.  I attempted to sharpen multiple pocket knives and hunting knife but resulted in knives becoming duller.  Stick with stones
0143119680|1.0|I really tried to like this book. I wanted to like it. I picked it up several times, and forced myself to keep reading. I got to page 253 before I gave up. This book is soooo boring! There is a plot, which I guess is rather interesting, but it moves forward so SLOOOOOWLY. Mostly this book is drowning in descriptions of clothing, exercise, meals, buildings, horses, books, and other mundane stuff that just doesn't matter.<br /><br />The main character, Diana Bishop, is supposedly some kind of genius who got through college super fast and became a research professor or something, but it's hard to believe because she is just SO DUMB. She can't seem to figure out anything for herself and she doesn't even try. She just lets this 1500 year old vampire lead her around and protect her like she's a little girl. She has all these supposed talents and powers. She's a whiz at everything, from rowing a boat to riding a horse to yoga to every kind of magic ever gifted to any witch in the world, ever. And yet, she plays a completely helpless damsel-in-distress whenever she is around Matthew. She can't even get her own boots on without help!<br /><br />But that's not the worst part. The worst part is slogging through all those hundreds of pages of boring, repetitive descriptions of every stupid little detail. The author managed to turn two chapters of plot into a nearly 600 page book. What a waste of time.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a really great game. you have so many games to choose from. also even after you have beaten a game, you can go back and play it to see if you can beat your score. even if you don't beat your score or the game,  you still get points added to your total. the games are really fun and some of them can be pretty challenging.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a really good game!!!!!!!<br />I really love it. its really fun. I hope that they will get more games though
B007MNV5WU|2.0|I don't like this one. It's too hard to aim and too sensitive.  I think they can do better. Anxious for the next one/disappointed in this one.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I love challenges. I haven't quite mastered the 2 suits yet, but I will eventually. who knew I liked card games?
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|What a beautiful album, full of energy.  It's only my first listen, not a close one - I missed the Grammys, missed any buzz around these guys - just a simple new discovery, but I loved it.  I MUST see these guys live - it is obvious from this album that they have to be incredibly engaging.... like a foot-stomping, bluegrass/folk/rock jam band that can lay down some beautiful ballads, all with a satisfying feeling of wisdom and history, and a twist of the British Isles.
B0062QRTKA|1.0|I don't like it beacauz it toattaly messes up the glory of God the most high the all mighty he regins surpreme and mosses only did that 3 times or more uh awful!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|The concept of unlocking new games by completing others is very ingenious and creates a nice rewards system that makes you keep coming back.
B0055SWM08|5.0|good game and fun. replay potential is high. would like more levels. good choice for the Amazon free app of the day.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Am not a reader, my bestie told me, no insisted for me to read this book. I am glad she did, everything I thought that goes on in a \\"Red Room\\" I learned its more. Read it and then Read it again. Enjoy!!!!
B005D51II0|5.0|I like pretty much everything about this collection. It has the right taste and feel to me. There are a few discs I probably wouldn't have bought individually - Wagner's The Golden Ring (with?) and the highlights of Puccini's La Fanciulla del West and Turandot come to mind. The rest are discs I would have snapped up - especially for the price. A couple of personal highlights for me are Britten's War Requiem and Mendelssohn's Octet. I have always been a fan of Decca, and this set reminds me why. Recommended.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy of books received via Kindle was simply amazing.  I could not put my kindle down.  And the best part, the trilogy was the same price as buying a hardcover single and I got it immediately.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I purchased this for my husband's birthday.  He had wanted it for a long, long time but really didn't want to pay the price.  However, I finally did and he is thrilled.  I read a lot of the reviews for both the remastered and the Blu-ray.  I personally had no idea which was better and finally went for the Blu-ray.  He cannot believe the quality and sharpness of the original programming.  He loves it and cannot say enough about how great the videos are.  This will provide hours and hours of entertainment.  He would definitely recommend.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|you get to build homes, hunt, fish and more! If your looking for something like the computer game this isnt like it. Its better than the computer game! On the computer game you can just skip throughout everything but on the app you really have to work your way through it.
1847940323|5.0|This book is easy to read and full of common sense ideas for making life changes. I love the anecdotes that illustrate the process. I appreciate the fact that it doesn't matter WHY we do what we do. It only matters HOW we can change it. I found this book extremely helpful. I've read it twice (the second time with a highlighter). The approach to change outlined in the book can be used in any situation to achieve the desired result. It's well-written, helpful, awesome!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Hay you guys this is a awesome app. You guys should get this like,  if you like to decorate pics. get this it is awesome!!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|it's a fun game but you need to have patience if you don't want to spend extra money. the energy runs out really fast but other than that I like it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game its so awesome its just like Mario bros. everyone who plays this game will love it or maybe you are just a person that hates games. but even if u hate games u will still love this one
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its not the game its named after. other than that its pretty cool. think farmvilleish type of game. or pioneer ville
B004I744AS|5.0|fun as well as useful<br /><br />I am hooked on hangman and the word matching game.  m learning so many new words. this app is<br />fun as well as useful.
B0055SWM08|4.0|This is the best puzzle game app I have seen, but it has one drawback. It drains battery energy too rapidly. Fix that and I would give it five stars without any hesitancy.<br /><br />I look forward to seeing more offerings from this developer.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its a fun game. and its a very good game for free. the only thing I don't like is that when you do something you lose energy and it takes 3 min to regan 1 energy
B006ZZANFG|5.0|I had Netflixed the dvd and just loved the music.  So, I bought the set.  I had wanted the cd to load onto my mp3 player.
B0034G4P4Y|4.0|This movie is a mixture of the  episodes in the Tintin canon, The Crab with the Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn, and Red Rackham's Treasure.<br />Tintin (Bell) meets Captain Haddock (Serkis) and together they go looking for a treasure trove.<br />Spielberg combines capture animation and straight cartoon along with Herge line art to bring the books to life and the result is a meticulous painting with many details that would make it a repeat watch, I definitely will watch it again.<br />The acting is superb, courtesy Jamie Bell as TinTin, Andy Serkis as Captain Haddock.<br />Spielberg bring the wildness of the Indiana Jones series to one of the most amazing chase scenes in recent times. Watch the motorcycle chase scene, but there are several scenes that will make you smile and keep you on the edge of the seat.<br />On the whole, TinTin is superb and Peter Jackson the producer and Spielberg the director have managed to create an entertaining film which will surely please fans and newcomers alike. 4 stars. 4/6//2012
B004EPZ07U|5.0|I'm a fan of Green Lantern.  A 56 year old fan.  Before CGI the only thing out there to stimulate the imagination about the unknown powers of the universe were comic books.  At least it was like that for me.  We're just now discovering new sciences that I swear was first seen in comic books.  Yes it was fantasy but what if it wasn't? What if there were really aliens out there.  And I actually feel sorry for those that didn't think the movie was in keeping with main stream entertainment doctrine.  You have to pay attention, think, and use your imagination on a movie like this.  On the contrary, I felt the movie was made just for me and others like me who still believe in virtues that defines all that is good about human beings, and how to overcome weakness.  This movie is the definitive description of what a Super Hero movie is.  And I'm truly grateful to the producers of this movie for keeping it true to it comic book story line.  For me its a gift that I fell that the timing was right.  At 56 you might say I had to wait 46 years to see it on the big screen after getting my first Green Lantern comic book.  And it felt great.  Love this movie
B0076NKNLA|3.0|The year is 1956, and the author Colin Clark, on whose book the movie is based on is trying to find a job, which he does on the the sets of a Laurence Olivier production, ` The Prince and the Showgirl' starring the most famous woman on the planet, the diva Marilyn Monroe. As expected, this dream pairing is a disaster, Olivier, trying to be a star and Marilyn trying to be an actor. Olivier, a genius is frustrated by the clumsy, neurotic and needy Marilyn along with conflicts between English stage acting and the new acting method followed by Marilyn, the Strasberg school. This is witnessed by the young Clark, who like the rest of the world sucumbs and vies of the charms of the drug dependant Monroe. He forms a friendship, love which lasts a week much to the displeasure of all of Monroe's handlers. Eventually, against the advice of everyone he falls in love with Marilyn and gets his heart broken, probably appreciating the lesson that  Laurence Olivier had learned: \\"When it comes to women, you're never too old for humiliation.\\"<br />My week with Marilyn does not add to the legend of Monroe but is a showcase of her charm and genius on camera. As Clark tells her, \\"Olivier is a great actor who wants to be a film star, and you're a film star who wants to be a great actor. This film won't help either of you\\" The rest of the cast is great and perform well. Julia Ormond is perfect as Olivier's wife, who tries to cope with her own aging and loss of desirability. Kenneth Branagh is wonderful as the caustic, short tempered Olivier, who is both enamored and repulsed by Monroe. The moments when he realizes that he would never match Monroe's charisma on screen are indeed worth watching.<br />Michelle Williams is once again is fine form as she effortlessly matches the childlike innocence, vulnerability and nerves that was Monroe. Coming on the heels of Blue Valentine, another great performance.<br />Strictly for the fans of Monroe, three stars.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this was recommended to me by family and I have found that it is a great tool to help me to be more consistent in my daily Bible reading.
B007NYODBS|3.0|The film is based on Yasmina Reza's Tony Award-winning hit French play God of Carnage is about the artificial fabric of civility being torn apart over a simple matter. Nancy and Alan (Kate Winslet Christoph Waltz), are visiting the apartment of Penelope ( Jodie Foster) and Michael ( John C. Reilly)because their son hit the other couples son with a stick on the playground, breaking two of his teeth. The setting is the apartment and the four characters are the only actors in the film and lasts for only 80 minutes.<br />The events start politely, as the couple try to hash out their differences but then the accusing begins, leading to the couples fighting with each other, man against man, woman against man, taking sides and ultimately their civility is ripped to pieces. The confrontations become less and less about their children and more about their views on marriage and the state of it.<br />The movie can be best described as an acting showcase,  Christoph Waltz, Kate Winslet, Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly are such fantastic actors that they could recite the phone directory and make it interesting. I personally thought that Waltz was the best, followed closely by Winslet, Reilly and Foster in that order.<br />Though not the best effort from Polanski, it is still a fine film. 4 stars. 4/10/2012
B000006OHL|5.0|This kind of gritty depiction of New York was more unusual then -  like The French Connection.  Other posters have given a better overview of the score than I can, so I'll just say that it does a masterful job of shifting between menace and yearning.  I didn't know this was Bernard Herrmann's last soundtrack.  I was interested to learn that he had worked with Orson Welles, then Hitchcock, then on the Twilight Zone.  Whatever Hollywood was doing, he was at the leading edge throughout his entire career.
B007JRU2UK|4.0|The ` Descendants\\" chronicles the struggle of a dysfunctional family trying to come in terms with a tragedy and a impending monumental decision. George Clooney is wonderful as he sheds his image of cool and tries to take charge of fatherhood and struggles to keep his family intact.<br />As Matt King ( Clooney) tries to face the death of his wife due to an accident  with his younger daughter Scottie ( Amara Miller) and cope with the rebelliousness of his teen daughter Alexandra. He also has to decide the sale of prime real estate in Hawaii to developer, and the sale is causing his family to become even more hostile. If this is not enough, he comes to realise that his comatose wife was having an affair behind his back. The movie is easy to watch and is lit by wonderful performances by Sid (Nick Krause), Alexandra's friend; Matthew Lillard as Brian, the wife's lover; Judy Greer as Brian's sweet-wife; Robert Forster as Matt's  father-in-law.<br />Alexander Payne, finding his form again after ` Sideways\\" allows all these people bare their emotions and act wonderfully while doing, amidst the backdrop of beautifully shot Hawaii.<br />Four stars. 4/12/2012
B0055SWM08|5.0|neat environment, simple to learn, increasing complexity, difficult to put down, good music , I would recommend even at a dollar.
0316921173|5.0|Having just finished Infinite Jest, I feel sad and warm and at peace all at the same time.  For me this book is Wallace's expunging of his personal feelings about addiction, interpersonal interactions and human frailty.<br /><br />It's tough to pin down any one point to the end of this book.  The overarching goal of the story itself hinges on this one point:  Did Hal watch IJ or didn't he?  If he didn't, then it makes a very particularly dark pall on things.  IF he did, one could say that Himself was successful in getting Hal to finally feel.<br /><br />It took the power of IJ to break Hal out of his shell, which tells us how deep Hal was in his cocoon.  That same power was way too strong for people with more normal levels of self-awareness.  Poor Hal.  James' final act was to save Hal and he did it.  It's almost as if Hal is behaving like an infant trying to cope with this new, alien world.<br /><br />That's just one small look at this monumental novel.  I loved it.  I'm going to miss everyone.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book left me wondering if I wanted to read the next book. I am so glad I did read on. I does get much better and keeps you reading and wondering!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is the story you've been waiting for; riveting, touching, and adventurous, this tale will reach your heart. Suzanne's writing is compelling and exceptional, and her imagination is simply unique!  (for more book recommendations by me, both in English and Spanish, visit [...] )
B0070Z4M4I|2.0|This movie was a lot like the original, only a billion times worse.  The movie started out slow, building some tension which was nice but then it began to fall apart when it was time to get scary.  There were parts of this movie where I thought it looked as if it were a SYFY movie as the visuals were on par with a made for tv movie.  The moments that were meant to build tension and suspense quickly fell on their faces as the scenes were all predictable.  The aliens were way cooler looking in the original also.  It was really cool how it ties into the original as this movie is a prequel but I would have been happier imagining what happened as opposed to watching this film.  I would say save your money for some chipotle.... Chipotle is so good.  I like getting the steak burrito with white rice, black beans, the spiciest salsa, the corn salsa, and both sour cream and cheese.  Sometimes I am behind a person that doesnt get both and I immediately want to punch them.... I mean honestly it free!  and they somehow compliment each other very nicely... I guess if you should take anything away from this review it is dont watch this movie rewatch the original while eating chipotle. Chipotle, Get It Up Ya ~RDS
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy this version alot. Lots of options and you can tailor it somewhat. Great game! Very enjoyable and easy to navigate through.
B0052Z0MJW|4.0|Dan Brown is such a great story-teller. This story is no different, it really carries you along.  The short chapters, switching from scene to scene, heighten the sense of fast-moving action.
0439023521|5.0|Loved this book, the characters, the storyline, everything!  I read through it quickly.  I was a little disappointed with the movie version but I still enjoyed it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I have enjoyed this app and my 6 year old also likes it and my mother who is 57 played it together.  :)
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I trully enjoyed the first two books..,storyline, character development all done in good taste with plenty of action. Then there is this book. SPOILER ALERT...It's as if the author lost her train of thought and had no idea on how to end this story so she decided to take the main character and throw her into a meaningless suicidal mission with no concern about the people around her (completely out of character). Killed finninck unceremoniously for no reason, then throws a 13 year old prim into the front line to be killed on purpose by the president as shock value. I waited to write this because i was trully disappointed. I can see by all the 5 star reviews that i must not have gotten it for some reason, as people compare this to the all time greats.<br /> This was not a case of me wanting more, but more of a feeling of being cheated. I want my time back.<br />On a side note..l saw the movie after reading book one and thought katniss was very well portrayed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it so cool I play it everyday it is so fun even my mom likes to playnthats how awesome it is
B0017VG69U|5.0|This is an awesome! I was reluctant to get one of these sets when they first came out, figuring it was just repackaging to get you to buy a product you've already seen a thousand times but I saw a few of these on AFTV while overseas and was really impressed. The color is much sharper than I recall and the use of digital special effects almost makes this an entirely new product... now when Spock looks at something in that viewer of his you don't have to take his word for it! Some of the effects are very subtle (such as planets being shown with atmospherics and texture, or computer screens with more realistic information) and others involve space scenes with other spacecraft never seen when the show was originally created.<br /><br />This one includes \\"I, Mudd\\" (arguably one of the funniest episodes), \\"The Ultimate Computer\\" (which has the Enterprise in a great space battle scene), and \\"Mirror, Mirror,\\" one of the best episodes of the series. My wife and I had a great time watching these!
B006JTS5OO|5.0|I ordered this movie for my son who loves the Muppets!  This was the best deal I found on Amazon, offering 3 copies of the movie (DVD, Bluray, and digital copy) for around $23 including shipping.  I highly recommend buying this!
B002RI90WM|5.0|Beautiful book a tribute to our fury friends. Makes you want to talk to them and tell them what is going on in the family. Enjoyed it very much.
0312576463|2.0|This book requires a little reflection before you comment. It is a very bleak, pessimistic book without any humour to lighten the story (in musical terms, think Leonard Cohen or Richmond Fontaine, but without any redemption). The themes are ambitious - the way our prejudices and values affect and distort those of our children, the influence of adolescent beliefs on future life choices, the process of emotional rigidity that occurs as you age, the irrelevance of policy debate to political decision-making and the corruption of personal values when confronted with real life. I felt that the emotional evolution of the two main characters was handled in an exaggerated but compelling way, but almost every other character in the book lacked credibility and appeared to exist as a prop to advance the story of the two protagonists. The props storylines are told at length and as a result, too much time is spent on improbable plot developments (eg: the south american arms deal) Some more literary reviewers have made interesting comments about the structure of the book. I found it hard to understand the purpose of switching between between a straight narrative and a mock autobiography/journal.why did I finish it ? The \\"autobiographical\\" parts make painful reading, but what I liked about them was that there was an underlying honesty about the \\"fog\\" that surrounds many of us when we make life-changing decisions
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game especially since it is free! I would recommend it to anyone who likes the Ice Age movies as well as anyone who likes the build your own village games.

B00170MYIS|5.0|I was very pleased with rechargeable battery I received. The item arrived before estimated arrival date.  Put it in my phone, charged it and is working great.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by the temp drop this gave my cpu. I went from a temp of 58c max load to 25c max, with a 500mhz overclock (motherboard limited).<br />At idle speeds I hover in the low double digits on a 1035T Phenom II cpu.
B0077ATSSQ|1.0|All the other low star reviewers have said it all and very well.  The main character was not likable at all and the rest of the characters were underdeveloped.  Nor could this young actor carry this film.  This was just sad and the story has nothing to do with what happened on September 11, 2001.  The father could have died suddenly in an accident and the 9 year old child could have been as traumatized because he never got to say goodbye.  Very disappointing.
B0059XTUVI|4.0|I lived through Thatherism and was transported back to those times as I watched the film. I well remember Mrs. Thatcher's inner strength and backbone. She was the only politician in the Conservative Party that could have carried it at that time. Whatever one thought of her politics, she was the right person for the job. This was the upwardly mobile yuppy generation. She built these concepts. Everyone was out for themselves, and didn't care about anyone else.<br /><br />Now I come to the acting. Meryl Streep is nothing short of brilliant in this role.  To all the so called actresses out there that are more concerned with being celebrities, this is what true acting is about. Ms. Streep makes us forget that she is Meryl Streep. We only see Mrs. Thatcher on the screen. She completely becomes Mrs. Thatcher in everything, including the very convincing British accent (and I am British).<br /><br />Now to the weaknesses of the film. I understand that Mrs. Thatcher is now suffering from dementia. I felt that the film played the dementia angle far too much.  I would have been comfortable with one or two references to Dennis showing up in her bedroom or living room, but he was constantly there, and that became tedious after a while. Regardless of one's politics, a film like this should be about the things that she achieved and did, and not focus so much on her current illness. I understand what the director was trying to do. It is difficult to do well in a short time and that produces areas of weakness in an otherwise wonderful film.<br /><br />Well done Mrs. Streep. I look forward to your next film.
B007I0WWEW|5.0|Recording during Roxette's world tour (still going on as of this writing), Travelling is a sequel of sorts to Tourism, in which live songs and new recordings are mixed together to give a picture of a band on the move, both creating and performing. This is a more focused album than Tourism, though. The new songs are mostly in the first half of the album, so this has a bit of an EP feel with bonus live tracks. That's not entirely accurate, however, as the album holds together extremely well as a full album. It's not just a mishmash: it's a fully realized statement. And that statement is, without a doubt, that Roxette still has it. Travelling finds the band reunited, rejuvenated, and sounding as good as they ever have.<br /><br />The single is of course \\"It's Possible,\\" which appears again at the end of the album in a second version. Both versions are great. The first is a perfect little pop gem; the second is warmer but no less memorable.<br /><br />Two other standout songs are \\"Easy Way Out\\" and \\"Touched by the Hand of God.\\" \\"Touched\\" was meant to appear on the Charm School album, but the band did not feel they had recorded it to their satisfaction. It was worth holding back, because this version is incredible, and it fits on Travelling better, I think, than it would have on the previous album.<br /><br />Elsewhere on the album, there are classic Roxette hits, a Per Gessle solo song (Perfect Excuse) re-recorded with Marie taking the lead vocals, and other fantastic new songs. Roxette is a great singles band, but few give them credit for making the excellent albums they have. In addition to their best, like Joyride, let's not forget about Per Gessle's amazing solo albums like Mazarin, Son of a Plumber, and Party Crasher. Travelling definitely makes the list as top-tier Roxette. It's wonderful to hear Per and Marie, clearly great friends, along with Helena Josefsson and the rest of the band, make such beautiful music together.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|What starts out as a wonderful page turner with a premise that is horrifyingly believable, really drops the ball at the end.<br /><br />With painstaking detail, the author takes us through the murder of a 14 year old on his way to school. The accused murderer turns out to be the classmate of the kid. What makes this a fascinating read (so far) is that the accused happens to be the son of the first assistant D.A. of this toney Massachusetts community. This presents most difficult conflicts of interest and, these conflicts make up the most interesting and exciting part of the story. What happens to a family...a marriage and the relationships of friends. The story not only works us through the careful detail of the crime and the indictment and subsequent trial of the boy, but takes us deeply into the personal tragedy of what happens to the family of the accused (guilt or innocence notwithstanding). We are left with the breathless anticipation of how it will turn out...both legally in the courtroom and interpersonally with the family which is (regardless of the outcome) changed forever. If you have a teenager, this book is in the category of a \\"must-read\\".<br /><br />I won't take you through the convoluted twists and turns the case takes and, of course, will not spoil the outcome for you. BUT- once we know what happens to the case...the author seems to loose interest in ending the book. We find out what happens to the case at about 94% (kindle speak) of the tome. But then...he has to end it- as if quantity of pages equalled the remuneration the author receives.. Almost seems as though he then began writing under a deadline from the publisher since in the last 6% of the book, new issues (that strain at tying them to the rest of the content)become introduced and the outcome (I guess he was aiming for a shocker) is totally unbelievable.<br /><br />Quit while you're ahead would have been sufficient. The last 6% of the book took what would have been a number 1 best seller and headed it for a soon addition to the 99 cent remainder pool!

B0073LWEXK|5.0|I was honestly pleasantly surprised by this game. I played their previous game, grisly manor, but I found that game to be only mildly entertaining. This game, however, was much longer, the overall design and graphics were significantly improved, and the game is much more engaging. Sadly, the story is still junk, but for two bucks I couldn't be happier.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Clever,  fun to play. Challenging but not frustrating. It only takes a few minutes at a time,  great puzzle game
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was glad I bought the trilogy for my kindle because I just wanted to keep reading. I had read the series in hardcover and wanted a refresher before seeing the movie.  I know I will read them all again.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Thanks gameloft for making it free and much more responsive than fantasy town and more fun too keep up the good work.
B0073XORCY|1.0|Like others, I am a longtime Tull fan who saw them live (in my case, it was the War Child tour) back in the day. I was excited about this release and when I heard it on a streaming service that rhymes with \\"modify,\\" I wasn't able to listen to the whole thing. I honestly wanted to like it, but it's not good or interesting. I recall some lyrics that mention \\"mortgage crisis\\" and some kind of take-off on American televangelists. I don't know.<br /><br />The thing that struck me is how well Ian Anderson can still sing. But that's not going to carry an entire album and this one should be carried out to the rubbish bin. Nothing to see here, move along.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I like this game but I hate tht whenever I pause it it takes a long time to get back it annoys me
0891419063|5.0|\\"With The Old Breed\\" has been cited as a top 10 historical rendering by several historians. HBO did the \\"Pacific\\" based (in part) on this story of EB Sledge. Victor Davis Hanson writes a compelling intro in this edition. I simply never got around to reading the book until now. The book is far more than can be rendered on TV. This is one of those rare 'all-nighter' or 'no more than 2 day can't stop reading' books for the historical reader.<br /><br />Sledge's work is a fascinating 'at the shield-wall' view of the horror of war and it's rendered from the gut of mankind's most ancient roots in war, and to evolve with `modern' WW2 weapons. The transition from civilized man into primeval warrior is superbly rendered by Sledge. How does it happen? What is it like? How does it affect the humanity of the survivor? Was it worth it? Sledge slides deeply into his psyche to understand a mystery in it all.<br /><br />There are so many stunning stories here that the historical reader will be overwhelmed. There are many quotes that come from this work. I found one notion that I'd not seen regarding Sledge's questions in regard to why the Japanese just kept on killing when all hope of victory was long gone. Why would the last man standing continue to kill people when all hope was lost? The European war was not of this nature. There are few examples in modern warfare, excepting ensured death for surrender, to explain it. Try as the individual Marines might to avoid slaughter, the Japanese warrior required and demanded extermination to stop killing people. This strangeness is as incomprehensible to Sledge as it remains to me.<br /><br />For those that might honestly desire to search for the meaning of the A-bomb to bring this war to end, this is a mandatory read. There aren't any other histories that I've read that are remotely like its narrow and stunning perspective. Sledge's questions will haunt your thoughts for sometime.

B0055SWM08|4.0|Quell isn't a complex game though getting the minimum number of moves is sometimes tricky.  Easy enough for school age kids.  There's no penalties for taking more moves to complete a level so you can't really get stuck.  The background music might be a bit too relaxed. You might just go to sleep!
B0055SWM08|5.0|good game.  I enjoy the meditation style game play.  thanks for making this game free so I would give it a try
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Pretty fun. Reminds me of Super Mario Bros! I wish you could pick up the turtle thing though. All in all a fun game,  especially. since it was free.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I read all three books before going to see the movie, best idea I had.  The books are so rich and detailed, more so than any movie could be unless it wanted to be 10 hrs long!  I personally thought this second book in the series is the best one only because it was the \\"guts\\" of the story line.  Think of them together as a three act play: beginning - setup, middle full detailed story to explain how, when, why and who and thirdly the wrap up.  All the books are deeply character driven and Suzanne breaths life into each one of them, especially Katniss, the reluctant hero.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|this game is so addicting! I play it on long car rides or just when I'm bored! there are mo problems. with it.  it is great!!!!  :)

0143120530|5.0|The story of how a young journalist came to find a niche memory competition while investigating one of his articles and went on to discover the secrets of human memory.  Thoroughly entertaining for the competition aspect, the book also offers up both practical memory devices for you and I to use in day to day life, as well as a fascinating, although introductory, history of human memory.  Highly recommended.

B006PTL1QM|2.0|\\"A Dangerous Method\\" is a beautiful film to look at, a handsome production design for the period, glorious Vienna landscapes all shot wonderfully on location by cinematographer Peter Suchitzky. I thought I would get that out of the way because my kind words must stop at this point. \\"A Dangerous Method\\", the new film from the talented David Cronenberg, isn't the beauty of a movie that it looks.<br /><br />Coming from the usually inspired Cronenberg, who since the turn of the new millennium has been on a roll much the same way he had been on at the dawn of his career in the late 70's and early to mid 80's, re-teaming with his go to star Viggo Mortenson, playing Freud and is about the only actor who comes across well here, and a subject with great cinematic potential, it comes as a down right shock for it to end up as such an inferior piece of work. It is hard to pin point just where this train skidded off it's railing, because as I've already pointed out, it looks great. Somehow I feel much of the problem lies in the casting, otherwise great actors, Keira Knightley overacts her character's mannerisms and thick, and I do mean icky thick, Russian accent. Michael Fassbender, who I predict will become a huge star and is already a fine actor, can't give his Carl Jung any electricity to the point of tedium, watching him you feel as though you would rather watch anything else, he is the cinematic equivalent of paint drying in slow splotches. Still, the major fault of the picture, I think, must be laid at Cronenberg's feet, even though he tackles themes close to him and his other films, he just seems unable to work up much enthusiasm for the subject mater, this is something new, dull Cronenberg.<br /><br />Adapted by Christopher Hampton from his stage play, unseen by me, working with rich material that unfortunately goes nowhere. I do not doubt a fascinating story could and should be told in film about Carl Jung and Siegmund Freud and the dawning of psychoanalysis, but \\"A Dangerous Method\\" seems more interested in the inner desires and illicit affairs of Carl Jung, rather than the relationship with Freud or the pursuit of psychoanalysis. Frankly, I do not care about his love life, in fact if Knightley's character, Sabine, had been dropped from the story, I think we would have already had a vast improvement. The movie runs only ninety-nine minutes, but it feels twice as long, a movie can anger me, frustrate me, offend me even, but it must never bore me.

B006UG90RM|5.0|Incredible comeback by one of the greatest rock bands in history.  Couldn't be more closer to their sound in the late 70s, the band decided to go back to their roots and  redo some of their old stuff, a good idea since many prefer the 78-80 Van Halen.  Incredible musicianship as usual.
B007Q476KU|5.0|This was a great movie.  Well written, produced, and directed.  I don't think everyone that has owned a pet has experienced such a bond.  Sure, they love them and spoil them and are heartbroken when they're gone, but not everyone gets to enjoy this type of special friendship.  Was it just me, or did anyone else have the urge to yell, \\"Aflac!\\" when the duck charged at the old man's leg?
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really waited awhile to get and read this book.  The \\"young adult\\" designation put me off, especially after trying to get through Twilight.  As a Prime member, I knew I could get this book free on my Kindle, so figured, why not?  I was pleasantly surprised.  While Twilight sounded like it was written by a sophomore in high school (appropriate I suppose for the intended audience, but I just couldn't stand it), Hunger Games has a mature style that can appeal to many more readers.  Sure the premise is pretty disturbing, teenagers killing each other off.  Yet, I found myself sucked into Katniss Everdeen's life and her desire to protect her family.  I have since purchased the book and the sequels, I just have to know what happens at the end!
B0058EBNAO|5.0|in my  view this is a superbly  conceived and executed app.  i also got almost immediate support for a time zone problem.  well worth the price.

0545265355|5.0|I bought this set for my 10 year old daughter. Hearing of the reviews of the movie, I decided to read this one first fearing it was an inappropriate read for her. I must admit that this trilogy really not bad at all.  Having read \\"The Hunger Games\\" in one sitting and read the next two in the following day as I was busy. I had to reread the first one again just to make sure of the facts before going on to the next one. It really is a must read. The author draws you in, making you empathize with the pain, joy, sorrow and confusion of the characters. For the easily weepy like my daughter, they will find themselves crying at the happy and sad times (well mostly the sad).  I've read a lot of books that moved me but I was surprised at this story which makes you feel a lot taking into consideration how the author came to write the books.<br /><br />The author wrote in a way that the plot, its characters, the dilemma flowed effortlessly. These books although fiction speaks of a time that can be applicable to what is happening in the world today. A warning for the things to come if power falls into the wrong hands. Of the 3, I really like \\"Mockingjay\\" without being overly praising, you would have to read it. What is for sure that it is, Definitely good for teens.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I think this game is really fun! But it sometimes is a little hard to hit some of the buttons!! I think all you girls and guys should get this app right when you see it don't even hesitate!!
0345803485|1.0|First of all the book was not well-written. Too many repetitive language. I thought that the opening scene with the heroine of the story staring in the mirror was a little cheesy. After reading the first couple of chapters, I was wondering what the hype was all about. it seemed like it was a parody or maybe the book was given too much credence by the media. I wondered how anyone would get through the book because I kept putting it down and I am an avid reader. I will most likely cancel the other two installments of this series that I pre-ordered.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I really enjoy the features it brings. overall it is a good game and I would recommend it to anyone.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|Not all critics agreed, and I'm very surprised they didn't, but John Carter is really about as good as blockbuster science-fiction/adventure films get. It gets it right where 95% of blockbusters get it wrong. It has heart but it always feels honest; it leads somewhere, reminding everyone in the industry that a blockbuster is not just a high-concept but *where* you're taking that concept, how you end the story, what you do with all those elements you created; it is very intelligently shot and edited with a \\"story first\\" mentality; it is brilliantly scored; the balance between humor, action, adventure, story and drama is just right; and it both pleases and surprises.<br /><br />Of course, the casting is top-notch, but this isn't much of a surprise for me. Everyone who has seen Friday Night Lights will know Taylor Kitsch is the real deal. He plays with conviction and passion; it's obvious he loves that role. He cares for John Carter and so we do too. Mark Strong and Willem Dafoe don't have anything to prove. Lynn Collins did such a great job, I went from thinking before seeing the film that she seemed pretty bland to falling in love with the charm, the personality, the uniqueness that she brought to the role. The rest of the characters were very well-cast as well, there is no weak link and I would love to see all those characters on the big screen again.<br /><br />Some people have criticized the film for feeling \\"generic\\" after the John Carter books have inspired 100 years of science-fiction films like Star Wars. I would argue that while that makes sense on paper, it should be clear when you see the film that Andrew Stanton was aware of that and added his own spin on all this to make it feel different. Plus, when something is well-made, it really shouldn't matter that it feels reminiscent of something else. We're talking about story-telling in 2012: it's all been done before, the only thing you can do with stories is do them your way. You can draw comparisons betweentwo stories without one of them having to be generic.<br /><br />Another complaint I read recently is that the writers and the director knew story-telling but didn't seem to understand drama. The example given was a flashback scene which, to the writer of the review, did not work at all because we were given information too late to care. I'm pretty confident that the writers and director knew exactly what they were doing when they chose which information to reveal when; this is one of the most basic decisions you make on a movie, and I found the decision excellent. This is a movie written and directed by guys who are very good at what they do, and while this does not mean that their creative decisions will work with everyone, their decisions definitely have the intended effects in terms of drama. I would say the script for John Carter is so exemplary, it should find its place as teaching material in a screenwriting class.<br /><br />One interesting aspect of the script is the fact that the climax is not where you expect it to be, and instead of being a climax about action, it's a climax about the story and about the characters.<br /><br />John Carter really made an impression on me. I hadn't fallen in love with a blockbuster in such a long time, it really doesn't happen very often. To put things in perspective, I would say that, in its genre, John Carter is as good as Inception in the way that those two films were masterfully written and directed to not only entertain but tell a great story and make us care. The comparison stops here as both films are very different, but it was the best recent comparison I could come up with since John Carter is a stronger movie than Star Trek (2009) and a much stronger movie than Avatar. I know the trailers and posters didn't make it look very good, kind of like another Prince of Persia, but if you want an idea of the quality of John Carter, just look at the names behind it: a two-time Academy Award winner as writer/director, a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction winner as co-writer and a 100 year-old hugely influential series of books written by the creator of Tarzan as the source material. As a result of this collaboration and the stars aligning, John Carter is a very solid film with a whole lot to like. It's the kind of films Steven Spielberg and George Lucas made a few decades ago. In other words, it's definitely worth the time and the cash.
1400032717|5.0|Christopher is 15 years old and has Asperger, a form of autism.  He can't lie, he doesn't understand human emotions and he observers a lot. He likes dogs, so when Wellington, the neighbors's dog, is killed, and he's the principal suspect, Christopher decides to investigate as Sherlock Holmes and find the real killer.<br /><br />I really wanted to read The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, almost all the reviews are good. So when I had a chance, I just bought it and didn't regret it. I read it super fast, even my mother read it, and we both loved it.<br /><br />Christopher is not common. Because of his Asperger, he's actually very interesting. He's obsessed with number and he's trying to write a book about his adventures. He writes back and forward on his book, every chapter is about something different and he numbers them by prime numbers, but it's very cool. Since I read his first words (and his drawings) I was captivated. It was like being inside his mind, where he sometimes can't concentrate on something or sometimes he concentrates too much.<br /><br />Also, I liked the mystery about who really killed the dog. I didn't have a clue (well, I'm not Sherlock Holmes), and several times I just gasped or just said out loud 'What?!'. Then I had to explain to my boyfriend what I just discovered hehe.<br /><br />Really, there isn't a way to describe this book as it deserves, but if you're at least a little bit interested, read it. Christopher was an amazing character, he managed to left his fears behind and made a great journey in a world where he is constantly misunderstood; and if you have met a person with autism, you will realize he's very realistic.<br /><br />Overall, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is one of my favorite books read this year,  I just can't get it out of my head, and I'm sure I'm going to re-read it several times in my future.

B000L53D4O|1.0|This toy is so light that my daughter often flipped it over while she was learning how to walk.  A better design would have been for Fisher Price to bring the back wheels out more for stability and make it a bit heavier - probably $1 worth in more materials.  Really, Fisher Price? One lawsuit probably would wipe out any gains from being cheap.  I would not buy this toy again and consider it the most dangerous toy we have bought so far.
B00005J6T0|3.0|1986's \\"True Blue\\" is the album that allowed Madonna to cross over to Adult Contemporary radio, which at the time got her a little more respect from critics, but unfortunately made a few of the hit singles (the '60s-sounding \\"True Blue\\" and Latin-tinged \\"La Isla Bonita\\") from this effort so overplayed that we're still hearing them in elevators today ad nauseum.<br /><br />Patrick Leonard's production here is all drum machines and synth chimes and that makes this the most dated album of Madonna's career. It's not so noticeable on the well-written, perfectly-sung #1's like \\"Live to Tell\\", \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" and \\"Open Your Heart\\", but it's cringe-worthy on mouldy '80s cheese like the insipid girl-group wannabe number \\"Jimmy, Jimmy\\" and both \\"Where's the Party\\" and \\"Love Makes the World Go Round\\" which both try WAY too hard to be hedonistic and socially-aware, respectively. Only the nod to James Cagney, \\"White Heat\\" manages to transcend the dated production because of Madonna's gritty delivery. It alone makes \\"True Blue\\" worth getting because unless you're collecting Madonna's entire back catalog, you're better off skipping this one and picking up a Greatest Hits package to get the singles; the rest of the album is forgettable and dated.<br /><br />Papa Don't Preach 5/5<br />Open Your Heart 5/5<br />White Heat 4/5<br />Live to Tell 5/5<br />Where's the Party 3/5<br />True Blue 4/5<br />La Isla Bonita 4/5<br />Jimmy, Jimmy 2/5<br />Love Makes the World Go Round 2/5

B000OZ0NXA|1.0|Funnily enough, I read this book because it was mentioned in reviews of David Baldacci's Zero Day. Many claimed that David Baldacci ripped this book off in Zero Day, using the same type of hero, similar writing style, similar plot, etc.<br /><br />That may be true.<br /><br />However, I can say with authority that David Baldacci's grocery list is probably better written than this book. This book is terribly written! What are people thinking? Cardboard characters, unrealistic dialogue, ridiculous romance - this book has it all.<br /><br />As others have said, the one redeeming feature is that the actual plot is interesting. In the hands of a much better writer, with complex characters and realistic dialogue, this book could have been really something. But the writing, the writing! Absolutely horrible.<br /><br />Stay far away! I wish I had believed the negative reviews of this book instead of the positive ones.
0446573019|2.0|Ok, Baldacci is a genius, but his books are either hot or cold with me. I can either zip through a book and barely notice I'm reading or I struggle with every agonizing chapter till the blessed relief of the last page is turned. This book was painful. Dragged on and on. Characters were not interesting. Premise was dull. Writing was fine, but not engaging. I had to make myself finish this one.<br /><br />I put this with his other bland books for me like Stone Cold. Whereas I just finished First Family and it was awesome. The other good ones are True Blue, The Collectors, and all the King and Mitchell books. But what the heck do I know. Others loved this book. So maybe I'm just in a bad place right now. We'll see. Picking up Sixth Man next.
0439023513|1.0|Similar to many reviewers, I very much enjoyed the first two books and was thoroughly disappointed with Mockingjay. There is a difference between realism and poorly nuanced/rushed treatment, as I elaborate below:<br /><br />While perhaps good material for a 3D movie, the action/twists and turns were rather difficult to visualize and follow on paper. It might've been better to focus on/flesh out a few scenes, rather than have the crew constantly stumble from pod to bizarre pod, and line-of-fire to miraculous escape route. For a book that was so 'realistic' in its ultimate ending, the consistently miraculous escapes against all odds seemed too Harry Potter-esque, and out-of place in this scenario.<br /><br />Along similar lines, character development had limited logic to it  - if I hadn't been focused when reading the one-sentence introduction of Paylor, I might have been left wondering who on earth the next President would be. On the other hand, pages were devoted to the development of Johanna's eccentric character, with no mention of what eventually happened to her. Why did the relationship between Katniss and Gale sour for no apparent reason and why did she choose Peeta over Gale - was it simply Gale's complicity in the bomb? Does that mere act, despite him not having known of Prim's presence in the crowd, negate everything else we've been led to believe about her feelings for him? Leaving something open to interpretation is no excuse for poorly nuanced treatment of such a central issue. As it stands, it sounds like Gale vanished into another district (very unlike him, based on his previous character development) and Peeta and Katniss were simply thrown together, as two people who'd had all else stripped from them. This seems to go a bit too far, all in the name of realism.<br /><br />Finally, why was the reader left out of such a momentous occasion - the toppling of the Capitol? While I was ofcourse not expecting a happy tale of democracy, we needn't have been entirely deprived of any satisfaction around the rebels' victory. To me, the series is about more than just the Hunger Games - its about future states of the world and the permanence of tensions between autocracy and democracy. While Collins doesn't explicitly make political parallels, a one paragraph description of the eventual governance structure would have given readers like me some food for thought.<br /><br />There is a fine line between explicit and unsaid parallels with our current state of affairs, realism and 'happy endings', truth and inspiration. Collins seems to have gone too far to the left in the final book.

B00756GKBA|3.0|I think Americian Life, Madonna's 2003 cd, which was a flop is better than Mdna.<br />  Mdna has only 6 songs i really like. Most songs are only okay, but not enough to grab on to.<br />  'Give me all your loving', is the first single, to me it is probaly one of the worst songs ever made. The chorus is far from catchie. The cheerleaders, chant is annoying.<br />  I can at least stand the song 'Superstar'.<br />  'Gang bang' might be one of my favorites on here, however it does have alot going on, distracting from the song. I do not like the song 'Some girls', because Madonna uses autotune, on the chorus. This is disappointing coming from a legend.<br />  The final two songs on mdna, 'Masterpiece', and 'falling free', are amazing. Sadly, thease two songs are the only two songs that match madonna's greatness.<br />  Over all, a big disapointment from one of the greatest musicians of all time.

B00422LESO|2.0|You know how you've read those books that after you put them down your first thought is: I could write that! And, a lot of agents and publishers believe that a line of reasoning like that is what spurs many of us on to the pursuit of a career in writing (because it couldn't be that our heads are full of stories, we love to play with words, and literature fascinates us). Well, after reading AUSTENLAND by Shannon Hale my first thought was: yeah, I could have written that, but thank God I didn't.<br /><br />Unfortunately, AUSTENLAND is a flawed work that needed a LOT more editing in plot and character development before it went out the door of Bloomsbury. The novel is about a young woman obsessed with PRIDE AND PREJUDICE who has a crummy love life and decides to go visit the Disneyworld of Austen maniacs, \\"Austenland.\\" At Austenland you can live as though you are in an Austen novel, meet Darcy-like men, play dress-up, etc. If you want more details on the plot, go read the synopsis, my policy in reviews is NOT to regurgitate the plot as that is a waste of my time and yours.<br /><br />So, kind of a cute premise you say, what doesn't work? Here we go: if you've ever heard the saying \\"show me don't tell me,\\" this book is the definition of it. Over and over again the author tells us what someone's like, informs us of the character development they are making, and tries to convince us of one psychological foible or another. We never really see any of it, it's just listed, like groceries, or furniture at Ikea. The book is one long list of all the supposedly critical psycho-developmental issues the protagonist is enduring, but it's meaningless without any actual proof. Even her obsession with PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is just thrown out willy nilly in the first few pages of the book, with no supporting evidence for said obsession. We're told that she actually owns the video of the movie (like at least half of the English speaking world's women) and watches it! Good God, that's clinical obsession if I've ever heard it! Quick, get the men with the straightjackets! It's just not convincing enough, and neither is any of the rest of the novel. None of the other characters are any better drawn, none of the storyline is believable, and nothing is fleshed out adequately - nothing.<br /><br />You have to know that I hate criticizing other authors. It's a bitch, especially when it's a situation like a book review as opposed to a critique group. I can't offer \\"constructive\\" criticism here, because what's done is done. I can only say to Ms. Hale: get thee to an editor that is better than the one you had this time around. You've got some nice ideas, but the world will never know it if this is indicative of the execution. And to the reading public I have to say: don't waste your money. There are far better Austenesque books available, and far better uses for your time then reading this one.<br /><br />Two stars

0451196716|5.0|Having been a long-time Stephen King fan, I was surprised that I hadn't heard of this book until I read a blog that basically said, &#34;If you liked The Hunger Games, you'll like these stories as well.&#34; Well, I did like this story better than The Hunger Games. As long as you keep in mind that this was one of King's early novels and that everything about the book is preposterous  so that you have to suspend disbelief throughout, then you can enjoy the book. The reason I liked it better is that I generally like books where people, if people are put in unnatural situations, will generally band together for their survival. This was not an every-man-out-for-himself type of book. Rather than being a detraction from the book that the competitors in this &#34;Race for Life&#34; built alliances, it helped humanize and provide motivations for why anyone would want to risk walking to their death with the slim promise of anything they wanted for the rest of their life if they managed to survive. I thought King had authentic teenaged voices, largely because King wasn't much older than a teen himself when he wrote this book. Also, King does a good job of creating a sense of place. He is able to place us in those small towns in Maine and make us feel like we are also participating in this &#34;race&#34; and walking with these boys.

0451197968|4.0|At first glance, Ben Richards is not your poster child hero- he's unemployed, his wife resorts to turning tricks just to keep the family's head above water and he is something of a rebel and thought to be the \\"enemy of the state\\" for daring to speak the unspeakable. But that's exactly what makes him a great contestant in yet another of Richard Bachmann's (aka Stephen King) twisted reality game shows. This book was thought to have predicted the reality tv shows we have now where people willing put themselves in risky situations for the promise of instant wealth, but actually, he's just retelling the old tale because  we somehow haven't evolved from the times of the gladiators where we enjoy watching people fighting for their lives. This book wouldn't have been as enjoyable to me if Ben Richards was all alone against the world, but he is assisted in his quest to survive by some colorful allies. King left just enough surprises in the final third to keep all but the most cynical from guessing them. As far as the ending, I told it to my teenaged daughter and she said that it's really how it should have ended- and I agree.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|I cannot wait for the film to be released on Blu-ray - and as the subject line states, I will be buying a blu-ray player simply so I can enjoy it at its best when I undoubtedly will watch it again and again.  The film left me breathless at its conclusion, based on the epic scope and ambition that its director, Andrew Stanton possessed, and the resulting product.  Don't be thrown off by the negative reviews that were printed at the time of its release, many of which played off as if the reviewer had either not paid attention during the film or even attended.  John Carter is a classic movie with great characterization, action, romance, and so on.  It has it all.  Buy the discs and take a trip to Barsoom!

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|The Positives:<br /><br />This is a fun game for all ages.  Several people have complained of running out of energy and having to wait \\"a long time,\\" but I believe that's part of what the game teaches: that we don't always get instant gratification in life.<br /><br />It's nice to have a game that teaches planning, persistence, decision making the unexpectedness of catastrophes and the consequences of those things ... and does so while the player is having fun.  Children (even older teenaged ones) have to really consider which buildings to build to obtain the most profit at the least expense, which livestock is the best bargain for their money, that they must plan for disasters by \\"crafting\\" medical items in the infirmary and daily life items in the work shop and that they must pace themselves (conserve their energies) if they want to avoid abrupt stops and starts.<br /><br />Best of all, it's wonderful to have some game options that don't involve graphic violence of any sort.  Since most of today's kids are going to be part of the game playing crowd, let's give them more games that teach the skills and planning of the Oregon Trail games rather than how to murder one another and maneuver through apocalyptic situations.<br /><br />The Complaint: (BIG one!)<br /><br />While it is infrequent, the game does \\"lock\\" up.  Typically, one can simply put it down for a while until it unlocks itself; however, on three occasions, it locked up with disastrously frustrating results:  once in having to wait 23 hours to play again, once having to wait 28 hours to play again and, the worst one, having to wait 167 hours to play again.  And those are game hours - not actual clock hours.  One those three occasions, it took all the saved energies and all the \\"green\\" dollars and never returned them.  This is something Game Loft needs to look into and correct immediately as no one wants to wait 1 - 7 *days* to resume playing their game and it's rather defeating to lose not only what the player has accumulated but, in some cases, actual \\"real life\\" money that one has paid in via a Kindle gift card or a credit card.<br /><br />For those of you who have experienced the locking up problem, please go to Game Loft and let them know about it.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found this almost by accident as a recommendation for me by Amazon. It was cheap and had great review. Those reviews almost don't do this book justice. it is an addictive tale featuring characters who spring to life from the page. It is remarkable to find an author whose characters have such depth. The story and the ongoing mystery of the plot are fascinating. You may want to just try the first of the five books which comprise the Omnibus edition, but i warn you that you will want the rest. So why waste time?<br /><br />Recommending this book is easy.
0452282152|4.0|The book opens with our heroine, Griet, being hired as a servant for the rich Vermeer family. Gradually her beauty attracts the attention of painter Johannes Vermeer and he becomes so enamoured with her that he permits her to help him in his studio, where not even his wife, Catharine, is allowed.<br /><br />The development of Griet's and Johanne's relationship is at once captivating and unnatural; captivating, as it holds the allure of forbidden love; and unnatural, because Johannes' interest in Griet is obsession mistaken for love. An interesting observation is that whenever Griet was with Vermeer, the atmosphere has a stillness and bleakness to it, lacerated with dark color and tone. On the other hand while she's with her other love interest her surroundings are open, jovial and welcoming, showing that a union with him is the natural and right one; or, as society would put it, the most conventional one.<br /><br />I also found it very curious that Johannes Vermeer's first name is mentioned only once in the entire book. Instead, Griet refers to him only as her \\"master\\". As well as adding to the mystery and potency that surrounds him, this device reinforces the idea that ultimately she is subservient to him, and in a time when young uneducated girls were little more than possessions, the place where the power to decide her future lay was with her master.<br /><br />Every detail in this book is meticulously researched. From the architexture of houses Dutch peasants lived in to the delicate process of preparing paints from grinding stone, it all rings true and draws the reader in to the wonderful worldbuilding.<br /><br />What struck me the most is that although this is fiction, I could almost believe Girl with a Pearl Earring was written in the era it's based on. The writing style is unfurnished and simple, but it resonates with the culture and tradition of the Dutch.<br /><br />One limiting factor of writing in first person is that the reader in confined to the protagonist's mind at all times, so when another character does something that seems unfair in their eyes, there is no certain way to see the reasons behind the action. For example, one particular character, eight-year-old Cornelia is as obnoxious as a poisoned-tipped dart throughout the entire book. I find it hard to believe that an eight-year-old can be as conniving and cruel as Cornelia was shown to be and would have preferred reading multiple POVs to understand the way she acted the way she did.<br /><br />Other than that criticism, I believe this book deserves the recognition it has received and more. If you have read it, I strongly reocmmend to watch the film adaptation because it gives a wonderful new angle to the masterpiece that Girl with a Pearl Earring is.agonist's mind at all times, so when another character does something that seems unfair in their eyes, there is no certain way to see the reasons behind the action.

Like, the time few by fast- I just couldn't put down the book. Being a perfectionist, l couldn't just stop reading mid sentence or at and exiting part. And the book was full of those you-can't-put-them-down-'till-you're-done parts. I would recomend this book to someone else, but everyone I know has already read or is in the process of reading Catching Fire. Great work, Collins!
0783240236|5.0|When I was in film school I used to look down on this film.  I was thrown off by the fakeness of some of the special effects. But as I've grown older and seen more films, I think I have a better understanding of Hitchcock's language, and now consider this film one of his most memorable and best.  The unnatural quality some of the sequences have provide a surreal strangeness, and help to create quite an unsettling atmosphere.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|i'm a huge Marvel geek. With that said, i have owned and read and sold many comics in my time. i usually only buy the dvd, as most computers dont have blu ray and a separate player or PS3 is needed to play that. but the deal is awesome. the package comes with a dvd, a blu ray and a digital copy.<br /><br />i bought my copy when it first came out. at the time, i didnt have an ipad or separate device. so i never thought that i would redeem the digital copy. finally when i did, the code DIDN'T WORK! having never lent it out, it made me wonder if someone had stolen the code, or if the code had been compromise. Then i later found out, that the digital copy has an expiration date! which meant my copy of TRON's digital copy was gone as well! (why did i pay extra if i wasnt going to redeem it right away? its a good future reference in case i ever buy digital copies again!)<br /><br />Please make a note that when you buy this version that your code for your digital copy will not work. it EXPIRED in SEPTEMBER of 2011.<br /><br />now as for the movie.....i didnt love the thor or hulk movies enough to buy them, but i LOVED iron man  2. the sequel usually isnt as good as the first one, but in my opinion this movie was awesome! rhodey lost weight, and the soundtrack included daft punk's robot rock and queen's another one bites the dust.  had some cool special effects, and black widow kicked butt. the armor's CG is eye candy, and mr stark's narcism is lots of fun. some may even think he's corny. but hey classic comic lines. in the comic, tony had a suit of armor that he carried with him to change into in a suitcase. which he had to don in order to become iron man. the modern suitcase in this movie is far more advanced, but hey thats what nanotech is about. (the old comic's nano suits appeared in comics like spiderman 2099..)<br /><br />as always stan lee makes an appearance in this film as he does with all marvel films.  i was hoping they would make an iron man three. but looks like they will come out with an avengers movie instead. next month in fact!

B004GHYCKW|4.0|A year after it's initial release. I still feel this album is brilliantly powerful till now. Let's face it, this album isn't for everyone. Point in fact, it's a complete departure from anything PJ Harvey has done recently. This album could have been done in angry strains of malicious guitar-fire as she did in Rid of Me. Instead, she chose to tackle the weight of her homeland's past and present in an entirely new context. By creating lush music to help lift up the heavy lyrics. Personally speaking what I find absolutely brilliant about this album? Is how she never sounds as if she's preaching to me about the horrors of war. Instead, she chose to do it through the letters of actual soldier's accounts who fought and died in WWI. (See Voices of Gallipoli which Harvey refers to in album liner notes.) AKA The War To End All Wars. (Sadly, it never ended anything.)<br /><br />Songs like The Words That Maketh Murder, All and Everyone, On Battleship Hill,etc. Transport me as if I was in the battle itself. Watching the carnage and seeing the havoc displayed before me. Just as much a tribute as it is a testament to those who fought for King and Country. It also questions the moral ambiguities in dealing with war. And the people that give their lives.

B0067EKY7M|4.0|\\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\" is a nicely-done British romantic comedy, built around a preposterous premise and the charm of two unlikely people falling in love.  Its very British humor won't appeal to everyone, but a strong cast sells the movie.<br /><br />When a wealthy Yemeni Sheik (an excellent Amr Waked) decides to build his own salmon fly-fishing stream in his desert homeland, government media expert Paula Maxwell (Kristen Scott Thomas) sees an opportunity for favorable publicity and pushes the project on skeptical Fisheries scientist Dr. Fred Jones (Ewan McGregor).  The reluctant Jones and hyper-efficient business consultant Harriet Chetwode-Tobin (Emily Blunt)begin to put flesh on the whimsical project, which takes on a life of its own, far up a narrow wadi in the Yemeni mountains.<br /><br />This is a fun movie with several narrative threads.  Maxwell's ruthless and hilarious quest for favorable publicity is one.  A second involves the troubled marriage of Dr. Jones and his careerist wife, and Harriet's stressful quickie wartime romance with a deployed British Army officer.  The main thread is the slow, uneven blossoming of a relationship between Fred and Harriet, as verbal sparring over a seemingly impossible project turns into a shared committment to something that might just work out.  A key scene comes early in the movie, over dinner in a Scottish castle, when the Sheik challenges the scientist's claimed lack of faith, using fishing as a telling metaphor.<br /><br />The movie has some jarring moments of excitement (the sheik has enemies) and some beautiful location shooting, including London, Scotland and Morocco (a stand-in for war-torn Yemen).  Best of all is the superb acting of McGregor and Blunt, putting their understated best into a touching romance.  \\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\" is highly recommended as good entertainment for the patient viewer.
0545265355|4.0|The book is far better than the movie but that is often he case.  I enjoyed the movie but the book is much more scary and really keeps you in the mood of the story.  It was a long book but it stayed very interesting along the way.<br /><br />I have not read the other two yet.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger Games stays true to the genre every step of the way.<br /><br />What always surprises me with books that take place in a distopian future, is that although the setting is somewhat detached and foreign to us, the characters remain staggeringly relatable. As a novel, Hunger Games does not belittle the reader by flattening the characters to fit into a group of narrow stereotypes - the brutish strongman, the foolish drunkard, the evil super villain. Peeta is a hopeless romantic, who is intelligent, strong, and charming, but absolutely hopeless at battle. Haymitch is neither a babbling drunk nor a secretly tormented genius. Even Cato, who could be argued to the worst type of person, mourns for the dying Clove.<br /><br />By comparison though, I must say the movie came a bit closer to oversimplification.<br /><br />Like other distopian societies, found in other futuristic books, Panem is a political commentary not on future events as they might unfold, but rather on current shortcomings that the author sees in society. The underlying theme is that a group of citizens who have been oppressed to the breaking point, come to see the idea of hope for a better future untenable. And upon giving up hope to change the harsh realities of their existence, these people grow desensitized to the violence of society around them, and actually become part of the problem themselves... at least it seems that this is what the author is trying to say.

0307455874|1.0|Before anyone gets put off by this title, they should read my review of Obama's first book, [[ASIN:B0029LHWFO Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance]], and they should read that book, first, before this book, and then read, keeping an open mind for valid scholarship, this review.<br /><br /> This is a book by then Senator Obama in preparation for his run to become President. He does write reasonably well.<br /><br /> \\"In the wake of 9/11, my meetings with Arab and Pakistani Americans... They (Muslims in America) have been reminded that the history of immigration in this country has a dark underbelly; they need specific assurances that their citizenship really means something, that America has learned the right lessons from the Japanese internments during World War II, and that I will stand with them should the political winds shift in an ugly direction\\" (p.261)<br /><br /> Without entering a discussion about the \\"exclusion zones\\" (not internment) in WWII, about which Obama knows nothing other than shallow Urban Rumors, the above sentence puts Obama on the side of CAIR (the Council of American-Islamic Relations), an FBI designated front group for Hamas, and an unindicted co-conspirator terrorist funding organization, funded in part, if not largely, by Saudi Arabia: the Muslim Brotherhood, (who assassinated Sadat and tried to blow up the twin towers in 1993) which is the parent organization of the Muslim Students Association (as well as of Hamas) on every major and most minor colleges, who use the documentation CAIR provides; the active Hamas and Hezbollah supporters in Dearbornistan, MI and elsewhere in Michigan and the USA, and Jamaat-al-Fuqua, from Pakistan, which has 28 terrorist training camps in the USA. CAIR dominates the Islamists here in the USA. It is the voice of Islam to the media and the Obama administration.<br /><br /> Our Muslim population in the USA is tripling, sextupling, over the coming decades, for CAIR et alia want the USA to become an Islamist Country ruled by Sharia Law, Obama is putting himself on the side of these Islamists rather on the side of America. His analogy with the exclusion zones in WWII is entirely wrong. Can you imagine anyone saying they are on the side of our own American Nazis, who are also American Citizens?<br /><br /> In an interview with Nicholas Kristoff on 06MAR08 \\"Mr. Obama recalled the opening lines of the Arabic call to prayer, reciting them with a first-rate accent. (`Allah is Supreme! ... I witness that there is no god but Allah! I witness that Muhammad is his prophet!') In a remark that seemed delightfully uncalculated (it'll give Alabama voters heart attacks), Mr. Obama described the call to prayer as \\"one of the prettiest sounds on Earth at sunset. Only a Muslim, or an Islamist apologist, would say this.<br /><br /> The Islamic call to prayer chills Coptic Christians in Egypt, Christians in the West Bank, Baghdad, Kosovo, many places in Europe, and certainly in Hamtramck, Coldwater, Flint, and Dearbornistan, MI, as well as numerous other places around the USA. The opening prayer that Islamists state denigrates all non-Muslims 5-times a day.<br /><br /> Obama has stated that Indonesia is ready to join the modern world. Well, it is not so ready, as the over 10,000 slaughtered Christians since 9/11 would state, if they could. There is no documentation that Islam is ready to moderate or modernize, no matter where in this world it is.<br /><br /> Obama has publicly stated, with emphasis, that he was never a Muslim. That is a blatant, deliberate lie, as my review of his first book cogently explains.<br /><br /> In an interview with ABCs George Stephanopoulos, Obama said he was grateful that McCain had not attacked \\"my Muslim faith\\".<br /><br /> Steely-eyed crack reporter Stephanopoulos played the part of Mike Wallace on 60 minutes and asked him \\"What do you mean by \\"your Muslim faith\\". Except George didn't do that. Doe eyed Stephanopoulos acted as if he was Obama's press secretary, and quickly said \\"You mean your Christian faith!\\" Obama replied, \\"Yes, I mean my Christian faith\\".<br /><br /> I have been a candidate for the US Congress and the US Senate. I understand how easily one can make a misstatement. But honestly, who has ever, in the US history of elective politics, made a mistake about what religion he believed in and belonged to? If Obama really converted to Christianity at the Reverend Wright's Black Liberation Theology Church almost 20 years before this, he should have no doubt anywhere in his mind about that. The difference between \\"  turn the other cheek\\" Christianity, and \\"Kill the unbelievers wherever you find them..\\" Islam is tremendous and unmistakable (Sura 9.5, from the final and concluding chapter, 9, of the historical Qur'an). It would have been nice if Stephanopoulos had done his job in 2008, for certainly Obama's response today, with 4 plus years to think about it, would be different.<br /><br /> As we know from Obama's off the cuff remarks, such as those folks, like me, who are \\"clinging to their guns and religion\\"; his \\"re-distribute the wealth\\" comment to Joe the Plummer, and his whispers to Medvedev about how after the 2012 election he will be able to really negotiate with Russia to give away our necessary missile defense capabilities, that these types of comments override his publicly practiced statements..<br /><br /> In a 2004 interview, Obama said, \\"I believe that there are many paths to the same place... All people of faith - Christians, Jews, Muslims, animists, everyone knows the same God.\\"<br /><br /> No Christian would ever say this, but neither would a Muslim. Does this mean that Obama is a multireligionist, which is as ignorant and irrational a belief set as being a multiculturalist? See the above quotes from the Bible and Qur'an.<br /><br /> On 06APR09, he stated to the Turkish parliament \\"Americans have Muslims in their families or have lived in a Muslim majority country. I know, because I am one of them.\\" The open question here is whether he really believes he is one of them because he lived in Indonesia for 4 years, or because his father and all his relatives in Kenya are Muslims. The vast majority of Americans do not have any Muslims in their families (at least, not yet). Obama stated, 01JUN09, to a French Journalist, \\"  if you actually took the number of Muslim Americans, we'd be one of the largest Muslim countries in the World.\\" Another \\"misstatement\\". Possibly true in 2050. We have, currently, a little over 2 million non-black Muslims, and 5 million or so Black Muslims in the USA. Seven million out of 1.7 Billion is not that many, compared to Pakistan or any Islamist majority country, or even Londonistan.<br /><br /> On July 1, 2008, Obama said he was going to go out and campaign in all 57 states. Everyone blew this off to campaign fatigue, or laughed about Heinz 57. There are 57 states, nations, countries, & kingdoms in the OIC (the Organization of the Islamic Conference), which is an associated arm of the United Nations. Obama met with the 57 States of the OIC in Cairo in 2009.<br /><br /> In his \\"heralded speech to the Islamic world in Cairo, Egypt, on 04JUN09, Obama said \\"I am one of you\\". This is not the same as JFK stating \\"Ich bin ein Berliner\\", to a western civilization, free and democratic, audience, contrasting the difference with Communism after the Berlin Wall. To whom was Obama speaking when he said \\"I am one of you\\"? He was speaking at al-Azhar University, the Premier Islamist and Islamist Jurisprudence University in the world. There is really only one degree issued by al-Azhar, and that is in Islamist Jurisprudence, aka, Sharia Law. Graduates of al-Azhar include such luminaries as Ayman al Zawahiri, the current head of al-Qaeda. Liberals bash Conservative candidates for speaking at Bob Jones University, but every American should have bashed Obama for speaking at al-Azhar.<br /><br /> So who was Obama speaking to? The Muslim Brotherhood, the largest political organization in Egypt? Not to the Coptic Christians. In any case, Egypt is over 85% Muslim, so he was one of them.<br /><br /> In that same speech, Obama said \\"a greeting of peace from Muslim communities in my country: assalaamu alykum (peace be upon you).\\" This is a greeting that only Muslims extend to other Muslims. Obama also said \\"Peace Be Upon Him\\" (PBUH), after mentioning Moses, Jesus, and the Prophet Muhammad. This is a statement reserved for Muslims to state always after mentioning the Prophet Muhammad and sometimes the other Prophets. Non-Muslims do not make that statement, and are not allowed to make that statement.<br /><br /> In Cairo Barack Hussein Obama (Happy Handsome Public) (his whole name is Islamic), quoted some irrelevant passages of the Qur'an, that Allah had rendered null and void. By doing so he played his role to deceive everyone about the true nature of Islam.<br /><br /> In Obama's Cairo speech in 2009, he declared that he has a responsibility to \\"fight against negative stereotypes of Islam whenever they appear.\\" What stereotypes would these be? \\"Islam is a religion of peace, and a few radicals have hi-jacked it\\" This is the single most ignorant statement than anyone could make after 9/11. Islam is a political ideology of hatred and war that rivals Nazism in how virulent it is.<br /><br /> In Mumbai, India, at a townhall, on 07NOV10, President Obama was asked his views about Jihad. He stated \\"Well, the phrase jihad has a lot of meanings within Islam and is subject to a lot of different interpretations.\\" Pure taqqiya.<br /><br /> There is only one meaning to Jihad taught by Allah, the Qur'an, the Prophet Muhammad, and Islamic Jurisprudence, and that is Jihad is Holy War. The belief that the \\"Greater Jihad\\" is an inner struggle is a concept mentioned only once in a very weak hadith by one of the least reputable collectors of the Hadith, and is literally nonsense to Islam. The \\"Greater Jihad/inner struggle\\" concept was foisted on us to fool us non-Muslims.<br /><br /> The national debt is the single biggest threat to national security, according to Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and that statement was made when our debt was \\"only\\" 13 Trillion. How can we fight WW III and win, or contain China, with that kind of debt ensuring we don't have enough money to protect the USA. Obama has also eviscerated our ABM defense systems that were well started under Bush. Please read [[ASIN:0765327252 One Second After]] and my review of that book for a greater explanation of how Obama is rapidly leaving the USA defenseless.<br /><br />FACTS: Obama was a Muslim when he was born, he stayed one at least until he \\"converted\\" at age 27.<br /><br />Option 1: Obama is a Christian, no matter how non-mainstream, and is an Islamist  apologist. He is an apostate from Islam, and every Jihadist in the world should  have been trying to assassinate him since then.<br />Option 2: Obama is a multireligionist, which is the most ignorant position anyone could  ever hold, and is an Islamist apologist. See above for apostate rules.<br />Option 3: Obama is still an Islamist, practicing taqqiya in dar-al-Harb.<br /><br /> Option 3 makes the best sense, and has the best documentation to support it.<br /><br /> Certainly Obama is not on the side of al-Qaeda or the folks that want to blow us up, but he is on the side of those that want to and are working hard to have Sharia Law replace our Constitution and re-establish a global Caliphate.<br /><br /> Anyone who supports Obama and/or votes for him wants the USA to become an Islamist country 5 to 15 years sooner than almost any other Democrat - or any Republican. Anyone who supports Obama is on the side of these Islamists, Stealth Jihadis though they may be, that are working hard to subvert us and to replace Western Civilization.<br /><br /> I can provide a great deal more information than this short review can include.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it sucked waiting on energy but I could find other things to keep me busy while it built back up. Fun to have a remake of one of my childhood favorites!
B0029LHWFO|1.0|Although originally published in 1995, this book has a new forward by then US Senator Obama and was republished in 2005. Of course, there is a second book by Senator Obama, and his record in his political campaigns and office holding, especially the campaign for US President and his words and actions in office that are part of the mosaic, and this book can no longer be reviewed as a stand alone of the person who originally wrote it in the 1990's.<br /><br /> This review is intended to be read first, before my review of [[ASIN:0307455874 The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream (Vintage)]], his second book, is read. One should read these two books in that order also.<br /><br /> In this post-9/11 world, both what is said and what is not said are equally telling.<br /><br /> Before proceeding, every reviewer should know that I have spent over 9,000 hours studying Islam since 9/11. It was an epiphany for me. I have studied the political ideology of Islam, i.e. how Islamic beliefs and actions have affected and do affect folks while on this earth. I have not, and do not care to, study, in any depth, what I consider to be the purely religious aspects of Islam. I have put together, edited, over 3,500 pages of documentation, written over 300 pages myself, and am working on over 1,000 pages more, titled AMERABIA, about the mortal danger the USA is in of becoming an Islamist nation, in whole or in parts, well before 2100, with Michiganistan becoming the first state in the union with first a functional Islamist majority, and then an absolute majority, that will replace our MI Constitution with Sharia Law. Some members of the United States House of Representatives Anti-Terrorism Caucus, 122 members, 40 Democrats, including Rep. Sue Myrick, the Chair of the Caucus, have copies of my documentation on their credenza, and refer to the future of America by my title.<br /><br /> The Qur'an has far more and far worse hatred of Jews, both quantitatively and qualitatively, than Mein Kampf, and the Prophet Muhammad makes Hitler seam like the nicest person you would ever want to know and have as your neighbor, as Muhammad was a prophet who was not like Jesus, but like Attila the Hun or Genghis Khan.. Islam is the single bloodiest political ideology that ever stalked this planet, killing more non-Muslims that the entire 20th century killed in total, including all those killed in war. Our own Muslims here in Michigan want Sharia Law to replace our Constitution and are having 8 or more babies per family. We also call it Dearbornistan for darn good reasons.<br /><br /> Islam is not a race, as most Muslims are not Arabs, and there are wonderful, peaceful Christian and Jewish Arabs. Muslims can believe that Islam is a religion, but that does not mean that the rest of us should be so ignorant and believe that. Yes, there are peaceful Muslims, but will they actively oppose the Jihadists? Iraq and Afghanistan will slide backwards so fast it will make our heads spin. Will \\"peaceful\\" Muslims oppose the imposition of Sharia law? The answer in Europe and America, as well as Islamist lands, is no.<br /><br /> England, Russia, Austria, and perhaps some other European countries, plus Canada and some South American countries, will have Islamist majorities around the middle of this century, and will be almost totally Islamist before the end of this century. Whether one calls it WW III, and whether that occurs before, during or after our own 2nd Civil War, we, the USA, are in mortal danger of becoming an Islamist country also, albeit, not demographically, at least initially.<br /><br /> Islam is a patriarchal belief set. Muslim men may marry non-Muslim women, as Obama's dad did with his mother. Muslim Women are not allowed to marry non-Muslim men, but in dar al-Harb (a non-Islamic land, or, more literally, the Land of War), Muslim Women are pushed to marry some non-Muslim men in order to lie to them about how Islam is a \\"Religion of Peace\\" and influence them to allow Islamists to take over the country from the inside out. A great example is Grover Norquist, whose wife, Samah, from \\"Palestine\\" represents the view that Hamas, Fatah, and Hezbollah are all peaceful folks that we should snuggle up to. In dar al-Islam, or an Islamist country, such as Egypt, no Coptic Christian male is allowed to even date a Muslim woman, and Coptic Christians have been killed for doing so, as have Christians and non-Muslims in all Islamic countries throughout history.<br /><br /> Obama admits that his dad is a Muslim. He admits that his Mom is an atheist. He admits that his step-dad is a Muslim. It is all quite understated. Because Obama's dad was a Muslim, he is a Muslim, until or unless he converts to a different religion, no matter how \\"secular\\" and \\"non-practicing\\" he is.<br /><br /> He lived in a Muslim majority country (95%), Indonesia, for over 4 years. Per this book, he attended two schools, one a local school and one an \\"International\\" (Catholic/Christian) school for two years each. That he was registered at both schools as a Muslim is not in this book, nor is that he attended religion classes in both schools, both on Islam, since he was registered as a Muslim. Obama has said that he cut up in class. I'm sure he did some of the time. I'm also sure he was taught the little kid version of Islam. In addition, he also attended Mosque from time to time, although he initially denied that during his campaign for President. This documentation regarding his registration, etc, is from Daniel Pipes (head of the MEF), who has photos of the original registrations and curricula, and has done original research.<br /><br /> I lived overseas for almost 3 1/2, years, graduating from high school at the International School of Brussels (Belgium). My experience in Western Europe was extremely different from Obama's.<br /><br /> I learned, very differently, that America is the finest country in the world, that it is a Shining City on a Hill, while Obama has very mixed reviews about America and Americans in this book.<br /><br /> I also learned that kids the age of Obama (6-10) in foreign lands only learn the little kid version of the culture they live in, which, regarding Islam, is entirely inappropriate, and irrelevant, in a grown up world. There are indications that the little kid version lives on in Obama, but there are also open questions about whether he has also learned the adult version, and is practicing taqqiya (the mainstream Islamist practice and teaching that lying to non-Muslims about who you are, your beliefs and values; and to hide and disguise the true nature of Islam from all non-Muslims is approved and commanded).<br /><br /> \\"She taught me to disdain the blend of ignorance and arrogance that too often characterized Americans abroad\\" (p47). So I, as an American abroad, my Dad, my Mom, my brothers and sister, my friends and the hundreds of Americans I knew were ignorant and arrogant? It takes an ignorant and arrogant person to make such a baldly false statement, but that is the kind of pap and pablum Obama was fed by his Mom; and that he bought into. Most Americans overseas were middle class businessmen, trying to do their best to earn a living, make their companies successful, and raise their families as Americans in a non-American environment. From all of the Belgian friends I had, all I can say is that the \\"ugly American\\" is mostly a myth. At best those that might be characterized as \\"ugly\\", as there are some in every nationality, were far and few between.<br /><br /> There are numerous books written that take Obama to task for his associations with disreputable and questionable characters, both explained in this book and otherwise. I will pass on those aspects, and concentrate on the Islamist aspects of this book.<br /><br /> Obama admits to admiring Malcolm X, as a Muslim. That's not fine, as Malcolm X was the leading edge of the mainstreaming of Black American Muslims into the Wahhabi and Islamist fold, as Louis Farrakhan, and his blatant, open, anti-semitism display today.<br /><br /> \\"Regina was on her way to Andalusia...\\". (p.116) This seeming casual statement is another indicator of how Obama is steeped in Islamist beliefs and propaganda. Andalusia refers to Spain when it was Islamist. Jihadists refer to Spain as Andalusia to ensure that everyone knows that it was once theirs, and they intend to take it back. Andalusia also refers to the myth of a \\"golden age\\" of peaceful Islam in Spain. As Reza Aslan, author of \\"No God but God\\" states, there was no such golden age. From the numerous books and articles I have read, plus the knowledgeable scholars I have talked to. I concur with Aslan (which I usually don't). In 1066AD, at the height of the alleged \\"Golden age\\", the Jews in Cordoba peacefully spoke out and demonstrated against the imposition of Sharia Law and their status as \\"dhimmi\\", or \\"kafirs\\", 2nd class, semi-slaves. The Jews thought the Muslims had \\"moderated\\". Oops! The \\"peaceful\\" Muslims slaughtered 5,000 of them for daring to speak out. \\"Andalusia is a myth. But this is part of Obama's totally fabricated belief set, which affects his actions as President.<br /><br /> Obama had a Pakistani for a roommate between Oxy and Harvard, to the best of trying to divine what this book states. Obama has subsequently admitted that he went to Pakistan for two weeks with his roommates (plural). Maybe these were nice folks, but they were Muslims, and Pakistan is not the spring break garden spot, it is one of the worlds greatest hotbeds for the Jihadists. Obama has never stated who he met, what they talked about, and what he did in Pakistan. Maybe it is all innocent. But why has Obama not fully disclosed what happened? This is germaine  to who he is and what he has done as President.<br /><br /> On pp 183 -184 he rants against civilization, industrialization, and capitalization. In short, he believes that factories that are set up in foreign lands destroy the ability of the natives to live of off the land as their parents did, and when the factories close, the workers are left helpless. Without going into the details of this argument, which I disagree with, he includes the West Bank as one of the regions that was so devastated. There is zero truth to that statement. There is no documentation to back up that statement. It is a total fabrication, but it is part of the Islamist apologist belief set, just as is the belief that Israel and the US government knocked down the twin towers on 9/11, which the Muslims in Flint still teach in their maddrassah.<br /><br /> Ultimately:<br /><br />FACT: Obama was a Muslim, by Islam's rules, when he was born.<br />FACT: Obama stayed a Muslim until, or unless, he converted to another religion, by  Islam's rules.<br />FACT: Obama was a Muslim at least until he was 27, when he purportedly converted to  Black Liberation Theology in Reverend Wright's Church. Once again, Islam's  own rules, no matter how secular and non-practicing he appears to be.<br />FACT: The penalty, by Islam's own rules, for apostasy, leaving Islam, as an adult, is  death. Numerous Islamists should be foaming at the mouth at the chance to fulfill  Muhammad's commandment.<br />.<br /> One normally converts from one major religion to another for a reason, such as the new religion is more attractive, but when converting away from Islam, it is also normally because one has found out the truth about the horrors of Islam. Obama still snuggles up to Islamist beliefs, so should anyone believe he has converted? Or is he practicing taqqiya, as Islam teaches, promotes, and allows?<br /><br /> The rest of the story is only told in his second book and his actions as a US Senator and as President.while Obama has very mixed reviews about America and Americans in this book.<br /><br /> I also learned that kids the age of Obama (6-10) in foreign lands only learn the little kid version of the culture they live in, which, regarding Islam, is entirely inappropriate, and irrelevant, in a grown up world. There are indications that the little kid version lives on in Obama, but there are also open questions about whether he has also learned the adult version, and is practicing taqqiya (the mainstream Islamist practice and teaching that lying to non-Muslims about who you are, your beliefs and values; and to hide and disguise the true nature of Islam from all non-Muslims is approved and commanded).<br /><br /> \\"She taught me to disdain the blend of ignorance and arrogance that too often characterized Americans abroad\\" (p47). So I, as an American abroad, my Dad, my Mom, my brothers and sister, my friends and the hundreds of Americans I knew were ignorant and arrogant? It takes an ignorant and arrogant person to make such a baldly false statement, but that is the kind of pap and pablum Obama was fed by his Mom; and that he bought into. Most Americans overseas were middle class businessmen, trying to do their best to earn a living, make their companies successful, and raise their families as Americans in a non-American environment. From all of the Belgian friends I had, all I can say is that the \\"ugly American\\" is mostly a myth. At best those that might be characterized as \\"ugly\\", as there are some in every nationality, were far and few between.<br /><br /> There are numerous books written that take Obama to task for his associations with disreputable and questionable characters, both explained in this book and otherwise. I will pass on those aspects, and concentrate on the Islamist aspects of this book.<br /><br /> Obama admits to admiring Malcolm X, as a Muslim. That's not fine, as Malcolm X was the leading edge of the mainstreaming of Black American Muslims into the Wahhabi and Islamist fold, as Louis Farrakhan, and his blatant, open, anti-semitism display today.<br /><br /> \\"Regina was on her way to Andalusia...\\". (p.116) This seeming casual statement is another indicator of how Obama is steeped in Islamist beliefs and propaganda. Andalusia refers to Spain when it was Islamist. Jihadists refer to Spain as Andalusia to ensure that everyone knows that it was once theirs, and they intend to take it back. Andalusia also refers to the myth of a \\"golden age\\" of peaceful Islam in Spain. As Reza Aslan, author of \\"No God but God\\" states, there was no such golden age.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|very fun game...love it! kept me playing for hours...the graphics are excellent and the movie is cute! would definitely recommend this one!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|awesome will love this game the future Mario so get this game because its free and awesome so get it
B004GYNPL2|5.0|This app totally rocks. It has saved me many headaches at home as well as work. Couldn't live without it.
B007TNQ7EY|1.0|It says that I have to delete over two gigabites from my applications to download. I only have two other apps! My kindle dosent even have enough memory to store it. So now I cant play the game I just spent 7 dollars on. Wow. Just WOW. I usually love gameloft games and I hope that you fix this problem
B001ADW4UU|2.0|It saddens me to write I was not happy with the dvd. It has nothing to do with my seller or order. But after bouncing with joy in my chair watching \\"Mama Mia\\" to the music,I thought the dvd from the movie would be as bouncy and beautifully recorded. For the most part,it was like they had<br />taken a boom box with a built in microphone that could block out talking and set it next to the tv and copied the sound track as the movie played. I was going to purchase one for my daughters birthday. I am sorry I purchased one for myself. Waste of money.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|do it. super fun and easy to play. I wish it was actually free..... but still worth it. If you played it way back when you will like it.
B006FE83UE|5.0|I know being in my 60s some may not believe I have never read the book or seen the movie,<br />\\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\". I guess I was too busy raising children etc.  I saw that it was<br />having an anniversary of 50 years,and thought it was about time I did both. So I ordered<br />the dvd and the book. What a beautiful movie. I am glad I was able to watch it with out<br />distractions. Great buy.I am now in the process of reading the beautiful book. Great<br />buy as well. (:
0374275637|5.0|Can you understand the modern world you live in without having any idea about the following terms and the concepts they convey: 'inflation', 'unemployment', 'advertisement', 'capitalism', 'liberalism', 'democracy', 'civil rights', 'energy'? In order to think about some field, to understand some aspects of our daily lives, and to communicate about them to the others, we need the terms describing them. Just like the terms given in the first sentence of this paragraph, the terms that became a part of our daily communication, we need terms and concepts to understand how our mind works in the modern world and what kind of pitfalls we face while we're trying make thousands of decisions and form ideas every day.<br /><br />So it is time that we learn about 'anchoring effects', 'narrow framing', 'excessive coherence', 'endowment effect', 'planning fallacy', 'the illusion of validity', and many other aspects of decision making and thinking, so that we can understand the processes we encounter every day much better.<br /><br />You'll have a difficult time after this book because it will probably make you think slowly and question many of the decisions you made in the past, and the ones you are to make in the future. As the Nobel laureate in economics and one of the most cited psychologists / cognitive scientists of all times, Daniel Kahnemann hardly needs an introduction. If you have ever read a book or an article about decision making, behavioral economics or cognitive psychology in the last 15-20 years, you have either read something inspired by his studies, or a criticism of him.<br /><br />\\"Thinking, Fast and Slow\\" takes the reader on a very gentle tour during which he or she will see the pitfalls of inner workings of the mind. Kahneman's text is very fluent, one might even say a 'page turner', and without diving into deep and obscure details of academic journals, it gives a very good overview of one of the most important and radical research programs of the 20. century. For the curious and skeptic readers, the book contains many references to the original articles, books and discussions. But the power of the narrative comes from the crystal clear explanation of many interesting, yet very simple experiments. Unless you are already well versed in the field, you are going to come up with very fast and intuitive answers to many of the described questions in the book and you will probably be baffled as the author will go on to dissect the reasoning of yours, which even you were not aware of.<br /><br />I am personally thankful Daniel Kahnemann for having given me the necessary tools to analyze the decision making processes of mine and others. His book will be definitely one of the references that I'll keep on referring to and I have already started to create a list of articles and books he gave in the detailed 'Notes' section at the end of the book.For the curious and skeptic readers, the book contains many references to the original articles, books and discussions.

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|in my opinion, at least. the only thing that bugs me is the ads....but hey, pretend they're not there :) lol its really fun though and I play it all the time. looks great on the kindle fire.
B001FTKOTC|5.0|what more can i say about john steinbeck's classic novel about the dustbowl? not much that has already been said.<br />this novel is detailed and extensive. to sum it up.it is the joad family,circa 1939 from oklahoma,forced to leave<br />their ramshackle house,on the road,heading for california\\"there might be some work there\\",meet some mean people,<br />meet some nice people,granpa and granma die along the way,hunger,some violence,and, a still birth child and<br />at the very end...a type of \\"re-birth\\" or at least an idea that these folks will survive as they have that<br />instinct in their blood. let us hope so.<br />this book is for older teens and adults. much of the dialog is what i would call,\\"local color\\" or in other words,<br />it is written the way these people speak. for those who have not read it,it is a great american novel,an american<br />story(our story) about the american people of the lost and lonely dustbowl era. sit back and enjoy. i think most<br />readers will never forget this book.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|The game kept saying my internet wasn't working and would not launch.  My internet is fine. I have a kindle and deleted this app immediately.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Fantastic linking with Google calendar. I have this app for all platforms for all my devices. We live through our calendars and this is the best app for viewing, changing, and creating calendar entries.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I must say a coworker told me I had to read this book next...in the end I had to pick my jaw up off the floor.  Great book, fast, engrossing read.  I was marking time each day until I could read more.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|I cant say enough about this book and how well it is written.  I am a big fan of historic fiction (Bernard Cornwell type novels) and this book sets a new benchmark in fantasy that has a history fan like me somehow wishing this was a true history. This books characters are new and vivid, the prose fresh and a bit sarcastic and action that is sweeping in an epic type of way. If your not a fan of the Bloody Nine by the time you finish reading this book your just plain lazy (you have to be realistic about these things you know)!!<br />Personally I will re-read these books again (the Trilogy) but the author Joe Abercrombie is a powerful new voice in fantasy that has me frantic for his next release!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I thought that this game would be boring but my friend convinced me to buy it. it turns out that its one of the greatest games I have ever played. u should totally get it
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it's. so fun its like Mario but way better I always play it in my free time best leperchaun themed game ever!
B007PTJOV0|1.0|this is an obvious copy of mario&hellip; I cant wait to see Nintendo sue these guys over copyright laws. and its pretty obvious that the creators of this game created some reviews.
0385342063|3.0|So this was a very amusing and entertaining book. Not the best, nor the worst.<br /><br />Both Poppy and Sam were good, solid protagonists. I loved their interactions, especially via texting and emails. I could definitely relate to that sort of relationship budding in that particular method (who wouldn't in this day and age?)<br /><br />It was hilarious at parts, I definitely laughed out loud a few times, but then there were moments where I just found myself skimming through the pages because it was all so predictable.<br /><br />Magnus (what kind of name is Magnus?) was such a pain, he was very obviously a jerk that I couldn't understand how she didn't see it. There was absolutely no chemistry, romance or any affection between the two of them that I was just left a little weirded out by their relationship and why she accepted his proposal in the first place. His parents were even bigger obnoxious, pompous jerks, and that whole confrontation at the end with his mother and Poppy seemed a little ridiculous, because personally, I did not buy the fact that they actually liked her but were annoyed with their son's actions. The fact that Sophie Kinsella made it seem like it was all in her head was silly, because let's face it...it wasn't.<br /><br />I love the fact that Poppy's favourite ice cream was Magnum White, because it is mine as well.<br /><br />And I love the slow progression of Poppy and Sam's relationship and how it all wrapped up in the end.<br /><br />All in all, a good entertaining read. Just don't expect too much.
B0055SWM08|5.0|it is very challenging. but fun and addicting. ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya aha ayayaya
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really enjoy this game!!! I recommend this game for any age! the Color and quality of this game are amazing!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is so awesome its so adicting and fun. I like the ice age theme because the charactors are acting just like the ones on the movie. This game is so amazing.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I remember playing this on computers in grade school but it has gotten so much cooler and even more fun!!!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|What a joke.  Amazon sells you the game and then won't do anything when it fails to run, eventhough the device type was specified when I bought it.  Looking online, I see most people have problems with this farce in programming.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is awesome it is just like super Mario bros you should get this game buy it now :)
B006ZNRD06|1.0|At least this recognized and opened a wmv file on the Kindle Fire.  The sound, however, was out of synch.  How is that possible?  The wmv file format is common and has been around for a while.<br />Another download, install, try, uninstall waste of time.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|4 stars for smoothness and graphics but this is a lot like smb... kinds boring wand no real catch.<br /><br />so quality vs interesting
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I like it cause it has things more then collecting coins and feeding animals and missions. like the game relating to fruit ninjas. and its ice age xp
B003O86FMW|3.0|To paraphrase a review from quite some time ago, one big problem with trilogies is the having to stick within the world you created part.  In your first book set someplace other than our real world, you're free to invent things -- so long as they make sense.  But once an audience has bought into your creations, you can't then contradict yourself or treat your new world any more sloppily than an actual historical setting.  So, if you're not sure how many books might follow, leave things open in your first book, then comb through those precedents when deciding what fresh challenges to throw at your characters in subsequent installments.<br /><br />Now, then: At the pivotal moment in The Hunger Games, Katniss and Peta strike what they surely HAD TO know was a stance of defiance against the Capitol: they agree to commit Romeo-and-Juliet style suicide, thus denying the Snow regime its authorized ending.  While this doesn't necessarily mean either is willing to become the face of the resistance, at the very least we now know that just as Peta didn't want to let the Games change him even before going in, Kat, too would now rather kill herself than play Snow's Games anymore.<br /><br />Senaca Crane has a heart and saves them -- and in so doing, shows a little backbone of his own, leading Snow to off him; this is the last scene of the movie, though Kat can't know this, as Snow admits until he pays her a threatening visit at the beginning of THIS book.  So far, so good.<br /><br />Suzaznne Collins' problem now is to thrust Kat, Peta, Gale, Prim, Mrs. Everdeen and even perhaps Buttercup into a believable NEW arena, not this year's version of the OLD one!!  Two Gamemakers with hearts of gold I can make myself believe, but as Kat muses in the midst of the first Games, though they DON'T ACTUALLY DO IT, the Capitol certainly COULD just outright kill a tribute in the arena; do you really believe Snow wouldn't handpick someone who would do just that this time his speech to Senaca about containing Kat's spark of hope last year having fallen on deaf ears??  No, this book should have been the time when Kat goes off-road, so to speak; she wouldn't even survive a Quarter Quell under these circumstances, let alone go on to become the Mockingjay afterward.<br /><br />What's more, don't you figure that if all of Panem knew that the Games held every 25th year were special in some way, they have been talking about it during the 74th Games, the ones Kat originally played in?<br /><br />Of course they would have.  And that's what I mean by having to respect your own world as an author.  If you don't create a complex and nuanced enough world to be able to dip back into for a plausible precedent in any subsequent installment you're going to have to weave something out of whole cloth when the time comes.  No matter how dramatic you make the \\"opening of the envelope\\" scene, readers WILL realize that its contents are no more a surprise to the producers of your Hunger Games than they are to, say the producers of Survivor.  If Snow wanted to kill Katniss, he could just as easily have her and Gale followed into the woods and shot by peacekeepers for poaching; why hold that ace in his hand when playing it wouldn't hurt his game in the least?  Oh yes, all Panem wants to see Kat married to Peta, but a regime as ruthless and firmly in control as Snow's could surely arrange a public double execution just as easily, solemly telling its crying subjects: \\"This is what happens when you defy us, your loving parents in government, and believe us when we say it hurts US more than it hurts you!\\"<br /><br />Would Panem really tune in to see old farts battle it out in slo-mo?  I know: Viewing is supposedly mandatory, at least in the Districts.  But that's yet another example of Collins asking us to suspend altogether too much disbelief for comfort, another problem with sequels in that there's a certain temptation toward laziness since you know those who loved your first book will at least buy and start your second.  Think about this, too: if that forcefield is strong enough to be used as a weapon, how can Kat's arrows and beatie's clever electricity trap possibly penetrate it?  For the last time, I say: Snow wouldn't underestimate Kat a second time -- especially not after the incident with the dress...<br /><br />So, three stars for effort.  If you just can't help yourself, get Catching Fire and look past all these implausibilities.  But if you merely LIKED The Hunger Games, you might want to sit this one (and also Mockingjay) out.ll at least buy and start your second.

B0055SWM08|5.0|great app, got it for free as the app of the day, but I would buy it if I didn't already have it :)
B000L3CHC0|5.0|I'm very selective with the things i buy and i have to say i'm very satisfied! I't s a great watch! i didn't experience any problems with the\\"two seconds/week\\" delay... I've looked for it in a local watch store in Colombia and the price is USD900, i also ask the man in the store if my Tissot was an imitation and after a look up he tells me IT WAS NOT. So, if you buy this clock directly to amazon is sure you get an Original TISSOT PRC200 clock.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Both the original Quell and this one are terrific thinking games. The graphics are wonderful as is the music. A great way to timeout from today's often hectic lifestyle and not go into zombie mode. Very well done ~ I would give both games more stars if I could. Don't miss these if you enjoy a peaceful challenge.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|plenty of great games to choose from and keeps you entertained with challenges to unlock the next set of games. a good free app in my opinion.
0307593312|2.0|I came here to write a long review, but I am just too exhausted after completing this long winded, boring book. The characters are all very similar (to each other and his other books) and nothing is ever resolved or explained. He sets up interesting concepts, but never explores them to their potential. If you want to read a book that makes you feel frustrated when you finish it, this is the book for you.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Best book I have ever read. Could not put it down. Read all three and can hardly wait for the movie.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|This is not what I expected, i.e. another police thriller. It is however, a wonderfully written story that tracks the return of Fin to the island of his birth and unwinds past secrets while he helps on the police investigation into a murder. Set on Lewis, the novel paints a picture of a beautiful island, a challenging place to live. The islanders have a tough life, steeped in tradition. In alternating between the past and present, Peter May tells the story of Fin's growing up and his relationships with the friends from school he has not seen in 18 years. It is quite a depressing picture, neither Fin nor those left behind have found life easy nor have achieved happiness. Fin himself is struggling to cope with personal tragedy. I gave this 5 stars, not only for the story which was interesting and original, but also for the writing. May draws his characters warts and all, and paints a fascinating story of an island so remote as to be a world in itself. The islands tradition and culture are beautifully drawn. I doubt it is somewhere I would like to live, but none the less a fascinating place to explore. I look forward to reading more in this series.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very fun and easy! so addictive!!! I love how its kinda fast paced but when your building. up experience I would like to see a numerical counters so that I know exactly how much I need but other than that its a great game!!!
0525423656|5.0|\\"Matched\\" was one of my favorite young adult books that I read this year, so I was really excited when I bought a copy of the sequel, \\"Crossed.\\" It did not dissapoint. While it was distinctly different than the first book, the things that made \\"Matched\\" so good were prevelant in this one.<br /><br />I am a lover of words. Condie's use of language is beautiful. There were places where I paused to re-read a sentence or paragraph that was expertly phrased. Not only was I moved along by the plot but also by the words, which conjured up beautifully imagery.<br /><br />\\"Matched\\" carried an empowering message about self-discovery and finding your own way.  The same theme prevailed in \\"Crossed\\" and I loved that.<br /><br />The love triangle rocks. In \\"Matched,\\" my heart was set on Xander. I felt Ky was too elusive and distant. I couldn't connect with him the way I did Xander. \\"Crossed\\" is told in alternating voices between Ky and Cassia, allowing me to get a much better sense of Ky as a character. By the end of the book, I had more understanding and empathy for Ky. I also believed in the feelings between Ky and Cassia. However, I was dissapointed that Xander only made one appearance in the book. I'm not quite ready to cross over to Team Ky yet, but he is definitely growing on me.<br /><br />I am seriously enjoying this series and I cannot wait until \\"Reached\\"  comes out!<br />Amber Garza - author of YA book PROWL
B007JWKLMO|3.0|While I'm an enormous fan of George Harrison's musicianship, I wish the documentary would have been more about his POST-BEATLES music. Let's face it folks, through the years, his role in the Beatles has been told many, many times.<br /><br />If available, I would have preferred more film clips of Harrison -- with a guitar -- in the studio or at least in a more personal setting playing (and/or creating). Nobody has ever delved into his guitar mastery -- that unique and wonderful slide style and his gift of being able to make enormous musical statements with a few notes. Since Harrison was such a private person, I suspect the kind of footage I would have been interested in doesn't exist.
0307279189|5.0|This is one of the mostly unique books I've ever read.  It is both an instructional guide to a better way to run....as well as a fascinating story about a unique tribe of people.  It also has a little bit of Ralph Nader in it - in exposing the running shoe companies for the fraud they've perpetrated on their consumers.  I bought this book at the recommendation of a friend, then it sat on my desk for 6 months.  When I final read it, I kicked myself for not opening it sooner.  It changed the way I look at running.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Best game l've played in a while. Better than the original. Love the characters and the helpful hints. l'm telling all my friends to get it.
0439023491|3.0|Others before me have produced reviews far more eloquent than I can hope to achieve here. I simply want to cast my stars in with the rest and hope to bring that rating back down to reality. Catching Fire is the middle \\"filler\\" book, although it is still more fantastic than Mockingjay...
0307591549|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.It is well written and short-chapter organized.  It is more focused on business; however, his principles can be applied to everyday activities.
0439023521|5.0|As the title states, I believe this to be the best book of the series. It's brutal, unapologetic and does a wonderful job of calling the reader examine the parallels between Katniss' world and our own.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Fun game. Love it. Highly recommend, Kids love it too. Graphics are good. Need one tot spring &amp; summer now.
0439023521|5.0|I picked this up since I wanted to read before I head to see it in the theaters. Even with the hype, i still had reservations of whether or not i'd like it since it was often compared to Twilight which I wasn't a fan of the writing and couldn't get past the first book. However, Suzanne Collins weaves a very intricate story line that had me turning pages quickly. Luckily, I have a kindle and was able to get quickly/instanteously download the 2nd and 3rd book. It was a great story that makes you think about the world we live in and reminds us that with war, no one really wins. I finished the trilogy late at night but so wound up with all the 'what if's' and made me rethink about how we live. I can see myself picking up this trilogy again the in future.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Do you even need to read this review? Just look at the number of 5 stars this book has gotten... and then buy it immediately. The plotting was excellent, the characters were full and captivating, and the story ran deep. This book now holds a well-deserved position in my top 20 favorites of all time.
B005LAII0I|4.0|\\"Mirror Mirror\\" got lackluster reviews, but it's a charming, funny film with a witty script and jaw-dropping visuals. Above all, it is sweet, something that is lacking in most modern revisionist fairy tales. I laughed a lot. This may be Julia Robert's best film in years. She certainly seems to be having fun! The entire cast is likable. The dialogue is contemporary, but not obnoxiously so. Wisely, the filmmakers didn't adhere to a faithful retelling -- that's been done -- but did a lovely riff on the legend. It even has a beautiful background score by Alan Menken. It amazes me that anyone can dump on a well-crafted, unpretentious film such as this while praising far less worthy efforts. I'm looking forward to \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" because it's going to be a darker, \\"Lord of the Rings\\" type of fantasy, but I seriously doubt that Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth will match Lily Collins and Armie Hammer's appeal. Watch this. You won't be disappointed!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great game to pass the time. I play it while waiting for the kids and don't feel I have the time to read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|With all the hype, I actually expected not to like this book.  I thought it would be like the Twilight series which was too ridiculous for me.  Instead, I found myself hooked from the first few pages.  I read all three of these books in 2 weeks.  This book made me think about the possibility of a world like Panem, and even worse, about the reality of places where Panem-like states truly exist.  I could understand why the main character, Katniss Everdeen, had qualities of being a fighter and also struggled to make choices or value herself.  I am a psychologist, and I see girls like her everyday.  Girls who have been raised in traumatizing environments who wanted to fight, but didn't know how.  I see how the fight is still there, but they aren't sure how to direct it.  Unfortunately, it often leads to self-sabotoge.  I think that happens with Katniss too.<br /><br />I love Collins' characters.  Her writing style allowed me to really get to know each character, to see their flaws and their attributes.  She is able to weave the story in such a way that kept me hooked.  I can't remember the last book that I actually finished and ran to get the next and the next.<br /><br />I have seen many reviews here that really made no sense to me.  Many people arguing about whether or not the story line is plausible, is Katniss Everdeen likable, that the writing is fragmented, etc.  I am not sure what the authors of most of those reviews were talking about.  I would strongly recommend this book to teenagers and adults.  Read a sample, I think you'll agree.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a fun game and has a huge selection of games. only one problem: its too addicting and too fun!
B004UID2LC|1.0|this app is good at first but then when you try just to watch normal youtube it redirects you to the app and tries to force you to download the video on their app. also it stores the videos not on the app but in your pictures. another thing it also frequently crashes and forces you to quit. please if you want to just WATCH youtube then DONT DOWNLOAD.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|good for kids teens and grown ups to it is fun good Color and gragh to so try it you will like it I play for hours
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Run out of energy to fast.  Other than that great game!  I don't like spending money on games so far haven't had to.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I heard all the gossip about this series of books and after the first book I was hooked! Yes the first book has lots of smutty sex but honestly after awhile the sex stuff grew old and I was hooked on the evolution of the main characters and being able to feel the bond between them. I am done with all three books and am bummed out as I feel like it was the end of a journey of two people I felt I knew well. When you feel like you \\"know\\" the characters in a book it is a sign of good character development in a story.<br /><br />For all of you criticizing the main characters and their unstable relationship, their BDSM stuff, the mood swings etc----remember its fiction folks! If you don't like it because of the grammar, it's sexual content, overuse of certain words close the book or turn off your Kindle . That simple.  Its not classic literature that will stand the test of time but it was a fun read with an ever-changing plot and a love story of two imperfect damaged people and how they grow together!<br /><br />If you liked the first book you should really read the next two......totally worth it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love how you earn money to unlock new games and I love the rewards! some games are harder than others which is great! makes you want to keep playing to beat them! very fun :)
B00753MBHA|5.0|Cudos to Wolf Hoffman and the boys! No longer waiting for Udo to return to Accept they have put together two of Accepts best releases ever in Blood of The Nations and back that steam roller up with the juggernaut that is Stalingrad.<br /><br />  Both of these cds are butt kicking metal served up to satisfy even the hardest heavy metal fan. Stalingrad is in your face from the first track to the last no slowing down, relentless, and absolutely no filler. Each member of the band is showcased and excellently produced bringing Stalingrad to life. Im impressed that they came back so strong from Blood of The Nations with this monster.<br /><br />  Lets not even guess what they may do next but sit back and enjoy what weve been given for now. Right now Accept is sitting on top of the metal world in my opinion. If ya get a chance to see them do it !
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I cant stop playing I'm addicted and I just cant get enough.  got it yesterday and haven't stopped playing fun and great game overall

B005BCE7FQ|5.0|This movie has it all from beautiful graphics, funny characters, lots of action and adventure, some great musical numbers, and it also featured many famous people supplying the voices such as Anne Hathaway, Jesse Eisenberg, George Lopez, Tracy Morgan, Jamie Foxx...and Jemaine Clement as the evil Cockatoo, Nigel, was very good as well. A fun time was had by all watching this movie, and the 3D looked amazing. I've watched it a few times now and am still amazed at how stunning the animation looks. I give it two wings up!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app great for planning seeing things up to two weeks in advance and adjusting to your life style like I said I love this app!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|really addicting game. cost money for energy but you get one energy every 3 minutes for free. you need energy to build,hunt,and collect profits.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fills some time without any problems like you have with a lot of games.  Fun to play. Enjoy it.would tell friend.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|Great book, flows effortlessly from decade to decade as it follows a family and their neighbours through interesting lives.  The historical content is absorbing and well researched.  Although a long book, each page was well written and held my interest from start to finish.  Highly recommended, particularly for those interested in anglo-saxon history and the class system.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I luv this game! a must have!<br />it reminds me of donkey Kong. :)<br />one of my all time fav's.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Easy to use, smooth levels, piano music gets a bit old but thats what mute is for.<br /><br />Overall all a fun game
B005PK1G76|5.0|I bought this based on the great reviews and I am not disappointed. It works great on my 2011 MacLaren Volo stroller. I don't have to take it off when I fold up the stroller. Fits fast food and coffee cups as well as sippies and water bottles. I hight recommend it!

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I am really picky on games but I absolutely love this its kind of a combination of all the movies
B007BLCGNU|3.0|J. Edgar was an interesting movie about such a well-known figure in US history. The seamy parts of his long-time reign were mostly glossed over.
B000RL4GS4|5.0|Basically, just read all the other reviews on here. They are all correct. It`s up to the music industry now to listen to the people and to now get behind this band and help them get to the top where they belong. No more promoting boy bands or hip hop. Time to promote hard rock again and bring it back into the charts where it belongs. If any band can do it today, Airbourne can.
0345803485|4.0|I know this book has been heavily hyped, but it really is a great novel. At it's core it's an awesome erotic story. There are some things that annoyed me writing wise, and character wise, but it didn't destroy the mood for me. Ignore the critics. If you want a hot read then pick this book up, and savor it!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|not a bad little game. runs pretty well on my kindle fire. only issue I have are all the microtransactions if you don't want everything to take forever.
9889979942|5.0|As someone who has not traveled outside of the United States, I am fascinated with learning about other cultures. Tom Carter's photographs are absolutely stunning, and I feel like I'm right in the culture. There are photos that make me smile and others that make my heart heavy. And then there are those that make me think, \\"Wow. I had no idea.\\" That makes for a good book, in my opinion.<br /><br />As a children's librarian, I would recommend this book to parents whose children are learning about China in school. The product's description that these images \\"break all the stereotypes of the Chinese\\" is spot-on. Children are able to get a very good view of a China that they are (most likely) not getting from school textbooks. I love the pictures of the children - when I show children who I work with what others are like in different cultures, showing them pictures of children like them really helps them to understand that there are children all over the world just like them.<br /><br />This book would be an excellent discussion-starter for parents who have adopted a child from China. A child can be exposed to their birth country through Carter's photographs. I would imagine families who were looking to adopt a child from China could also use this book to go deeper into understanding the country. Carter's photographs are up close, personal, and really make you feel like you've visit China.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I started with Brainium's Solitaire game before trying out this one. Very well done, high quality game, and very nicely executed, highly recommend!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|good game<br />good game a lot like Mario. only it has an annoying. song that never changes. would reccomend though!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|got it on my kindle and love it so far. especially the full energy alerts. it is a fun game.
0553386794|5.0|I've been hearing about this book for ages, but didn't read until recently because I admit the cover just didn't do it for me. This book is a great start to a series. The author has developed every area of the novel from the world building itself right down to the politics. Some of the fight scenes I did skim through because I don't like that sort of thing, but I suspect most readers will enjoy that. It's an action packed story. Things aren't always what they appear in this book ... don't judge people too soon, they may surprise you! I may read more of this series in the future.<br /><br />For those who enjoyed [[ASIN:B005W5L38G The Grimoire: Lichgates (a young adult epic fantasy adventure) (The Grimoire Trilogy)]] for the detailed world building, diverse and well developed characters, and for being action packed, I would recommend they read Game of Thrones also. They won't be disappointed.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I did not expect this book to be as good as it was. Truly inspiring and an eye opener. Im a very big fan of poetry so I was even more in love with it. Its amazing how one is able to express such emotional things in a poem. Loved every character especially Kel and Clauder because they were very funny and entertaining. The things these kids said had me laughing through out the book. It was also a very emotional read and heart warming. Will definataley read agin. MUST READ PPL!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a simple time killer lots of fun easy to make money and I like hunt the animals and doing quests.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Decided to go out on a limb and try the table top game everyone has been talking about.  Boy am I glad I did!<br /><br />The rules were really simple to learn.  The board doesn't take long to set up and games take about 1.5 hours.  2 technically can play and learn the ropes, but the game is meant for 3-4 people.  Deciding where you start usually takes a bit, and decisions later can affect how the whole game will pan out.<br /><br />There is some strategy, but most of the game is based around the luck of the dice.  So if luck based games aren't for you I'd be a bit wary of Catan.  Me and my friends have fun with a game or two a night and leave it at that until next time.  Games can be frustrating if you're not winning - you could be stranded, blocked in and not getting resources for the longest time; and if people aren't willing to trade there's little incentive to keep playing.<br /><br />Overalll, Catan is a great beginner's table top game and a lot of fun!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Fun game,  it does start to get slow after a while. it really pushes for you to spend money on the game which gets annoying.  I would rather have advertisements on the screen and be able to level up faster.  once you run out of energy you have to wait 3min per energy before you can do anything.
B0055SWM08|5.0|great game relaxing and challenging at the same time! hints available as needed...well thought out with good layouts on each level. love the music!!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it reminds me of morio bros love it people who don't like it are crazy lol jk.  you should really try it its a really great game. its great on your kindle fire.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It is a quick read that I enjoyed.  That being said, the book is at times both trite and over the top.  It was not entirely believable, but that is to be expected from the plot.  If you can suspend belief and enjoy the ride, buy it and have fun!
B005I6EU7U|1.0|I read positive reviews about this product.  When I got my Kindle fire for the holiday, I purchased this as it looks very elegant.  However, it simply does not fit the Kindle fire.  I gave the manufacturer the benefit of the doubt and did as instructed to mold the cover to the Kfire.  It simply does not work.  It has been 3 months.  The spine is too small as in width.  If they widened the spine, it would be perfect.  Not sure what I am going to do, I need a cover to protect my Kindle.  I was told of a company that made leather covers for the Kindle that did not fit and paid reviewers for good reviews.  I hope these are not the same people.
0345803485|3.0|I agree with most of the 1,2 and 3 star ratings. The best part of this particular book was the ending which coerced me into reading the second book. However, the Kindle version is way over priced. There were three blank pages throughout the book. Thankfully the book is repetitive enough it was no great loss but disappointing because of the price.<br /><br />That said I won't re-read this book. How do I give it away?
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my kids and I love this. we love the movies very much. I have to play this all the time. I play it on my fire and it works great...no problems :-)(-:
B004SIP6ZE|5.0|Ever since I was a teenager, The Crow was 1 of the biggest movies in the history of my childhood. Having being a fan of the rock/goth culture, this is a movie that does have something in it for everyone, is not just aimed at rock n' roll fans, even though at times the movie can look like a violent music video.<br /><br />When a rock guitarist Eric Draven along with his fiance Shelley Webster are murdered a day before their wedding, a Crow comes around to bring Eric back as an undead avenger to gain exact revenge on his killers.<br /><br />I really can't say much more to convince people to at least watch this once, even if you don't think you're gonna like it. It is a shame that Brandon Lee isn't alive today to do more movies. According to research, while The Crow was being filmed, a prop gun misfired that would put Brandon Lee in the hospital that would end his life officially. It is amazing that this awesome movie was preserved, but Brandon would've made for an excellent action star like his father, the late Bruce Lee. I still say this to this day even though the death happened in 1993.<br /><br /> R.I.P. BRANDON LEE
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it!it's so much fun to play with.I think that you're going to like it a lot. there are bunch of fun game on it.but you need a lot of points to unlock son games.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|the app is fun. you can write on the photos you have, you can crop the pictures, and put borders on them too.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This is the second book in the Fifty Shades trilogy, about Christian Gray and Anastasia Steele.  Ana and Christian's romance develops as they deal with situations regarding Christian's exes and Ana's new boss.  Both continue growing and maturing as individuals and in their relationship, as their relationship progresses to the next level.  It's a good story and well-written.  I gave it 4 stars because I didn't enjoy it as well as I did the first book.
0761169253|5.0|Just spent less than an hour reading a great book.  Yes, I'm biased. It was written by my nephew.  \\"Steal Like An Artist,\\" by Austin Kleon, is for anybody who is, was or will be stuck in their own creative neurosis, unable to accept their giftings, unable to move forward, unable to risk failure.  Perhaps what I love most about the book is the surprisingly practical advice it offers to creative types from a young man I view as a creative genius. I didn't expect this ultra-deep thinking melancholy, whom I've watched grow up (albeit from a distance), to offer such wonderfully useful instruction.  The book, which has quickly made the New York Times best-seller list for advice books, is also amazingly spiritual. Full of subtle but sound biblical encouragement (which I'm pretty sure was unintentional), this easy-reading, 140-page work could easily be the basis of a small-group (Bible?) study. And before the religious Pharisees of our day start railing about how the title defies the eighth commandment, please just save it. (You'd do well to heed the encouragement of Bishop Joseph Garlington of Covenant Church of Pittsburgh - one of the great pastors of our day - who openly acknowledges that when he hears a great nugget from other pastors or spiritual leaders, he won't hesitate to steal it, though he'll give credit the first time.)  With chapter titles like \\"Don't Wait Until You Know Who Are To Get Started,\\" \\"Use Your Hands,\\" \\"Do Good Work and Share it With People\\" and \\"Be Nice,\\" the advice is in some ways a handbook for living out life as God designed us to do.  I already have at least 10 people I have in mind who need to read this book. I'll be placing my order shortly.  Years ago when Austin first created his website [...], I told his mom that a day would come when people would discover him - that his work would one day have a wider audience. It's exciting for me to see that happening.  What's perhaps most exciting for me is to see how grounded Austin is. It's very easyfor creatives to get lost and detached in their own creativity. Clearly that hasn't happened with Austin. Of course, I credit God - and a praying grandmother - for that influence, which I'm certain will continue to bear fruit for years to come.  Good job, Austin. I'm proud of you.  To order the book, click Austin's website link here. Austin, who lives in Austin, Texas, with his wife, Meghan, will be in Cleveland, Ohio, on June 9 as part of his \\"Steal Across America\\" book tour. Check it out if you get a chance.  This review was first posted on [...], where Jeff Schoch is senior pastor.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|pros - acess to evernote - integrated notetaking and clipping unmatched in the market place;<br />cons - clipping dependent on individual app.
B0065IA4F2|5.0|It was a great download and I couldn't believe how cheap it was!  The only downfall was that it didn't have \\"Motto\\" included as one of the tracks.  Overall it was worth the .25 cents!
0061726834|3.0|I first saw this book in Times magazine and they where comparing it and Divergent to the Hunger Games, and as I was to learn its not like that at all. It is in a dystopian society, but the violence thats in the Hunger Games is in it, but comes towards the end and the middle-ish part of the book. This more of a romantic book than anything else and its really SLOW! But if you stick with it, to me, it will get better. The ending was really sad, but the sequel, now that COULD be compared to the Hunger Games!
B006NXIO0Q|4.0|is a good movie. rented for 99 cents and was worth more than 99 cents for sure.  would recommend watching.
B005WGBQ9G|5.0|Okay first off, the story line and progression is slow because its a DRAMA. When i was suspended from school, and stayed at home and watched tv, i was stuck with watching soaps because we couldnt afford cable, and many of those dramas where sloooooww....So that brings me to this show, yeah its going to be slow, and i appreciate that, too many shows are fast paced and character development happens way too soon. I've seen all of the first and second season, and the show catches me off guard like no other. Some characters are obvious like Shane, but others like Andrea, to go from a weak suicidal person, to a stronger more independant woman was unseen. I figured Andrea would stay her suicidal self. Next comes Carl, a young boy who has seen way too much and gone through alot, he could have remained a weak character, but as the days go by he steels his mind.<br /><br />Now to the comment about why Rick leting Carl approach the deer. Its common knowledge to never approach wild life in areas with potiential hunters, but heres the thing, its the mother loving apocalypse, they, including myself, would not exactly expect many hunters in the area, and regardless of Carl approaching the deer with the potential of a hunter, there's ALSWAYS that risk factor of a walker springing up and biting him. With that said, him approaching that deer was symbolic. It was an opportunity for Carl to see something that was beautiful in a world gone to hell. If i were a father, and I had my kid with me, and they saw a deer and had a chance to interact with it, I would give my kid that chance because who knows when he or she will ever get to see the wonders of life, when all this kid has seen is death.<br /><br />For the characters acting \\"stupid\\" its SURVIVAL, like many have pointed out there are 2 police officers, they're the only ones who has been through life or death situations prior to the walkers. Many of you can think \\"im ready for an zombie scenario\\" but your not. You may have the equipment on standby, like shelters and bug out bags, but unless you've been in a life or death situation already (survival situation) then your not ready. Do yourself a favor and get out of denial because any army vetren (such as my father), will tell you that all your preparidness will be worth nothing unless you've been in a survival situation. A common person, such a lawyer, cashier, ect. will most likely act stupid, more or less because they havent had the slightest clue what to do without the norms of society.<br /><br />So unless all the characters are from the police department, military, national guard or any job that puts that persons life on the line on a day to day basis, I foresee the characters making bad decisions or being \\"stupid\\". People do dumb things when their scared and panicked.<br /><br />To those of you who are my age (21) and younger, we come from a fast pace, instant gratification generation. But we gotta stop that crap, and slow it down, and remember that this is a drama. I appreciate this show because of its pace, I love watching old 2-3 even 4 hour long westerns where story line developes very slowly, I even like slow movies like the Big Lobowski. So learn to appreciate the pace, because if this show gets too fast paced like yall are wishing for...well your just going to dislike the show because it will turn into a mindless action flick. I honestly think this show brings back what alot of hollywood has lost. There are way too many cut and paste shows, I actually feel like im watching a unique show, rather than some clone with new names.
B005723JSQ|4.0|I've read most of Sophie Kinsella's other books, and I really thought that this one was one of her best.  I absolutely hated the footnote thing going on though.  Who could keep track of that on a kindle? Because of that, I probably missed out on quite a few of her witty comments, but still loved this book. The phone thing was funny because that's truly how people are now days.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a very well-done game. The graphs are simple and elegant, the puzzles are really challenging and the user interface is easy and intuitive.  It's my favorite Android puzzle game I have played so far. I look forward to more games from these creators!
B0015HOFZI|1.0|Re: Sony PS-LX300USB USB Stereo Turntable<br /><br />Some items essential to the function of the equipment were missing: software, cables, multisize-record inserts, and instruction manual.  These were all superflous, however, since the electronics were also, non-functional.  Neither the motor nor any controls ever turned on. In short, the box was filled with junk.
B0055SWM08|5.0|For all puzzle lovers I recommend this game. The game is easy to use and challenging. It easily helps pass the time by.
