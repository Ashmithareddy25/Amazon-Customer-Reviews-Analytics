B0073PZIYI|3.0|This was an OK movie.  The story was a good one but the acting was just so-so.  Glad that it was just a rental and did not pay to see in theater.
B00846TTDG|5.0|i have seen other action SEAL type movies. There is no comparison....This movie held me the whole time.  There is no let down on realism or action.  Great flick. period!
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|This was a great movie.  The special affect were stellar, the acting was good, and the story was great.  Would definitely recommend this movie to others.
0307341550|3.0|I don't think it was as good as Gone Girl, but I was intriguing enough to get me to the end wanting to know WHO-Done-it.  Sharp Object is a murder mystery in a small town with a creepy family...  It's a quick read.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|worth the time and money.  Better than anything new that ive read.  I've read David Eddings, John Marco, Brandon Sanderson, Robert Jordan, Terry Brooks, Tad Williams, Terry Goodkind and many more fantasy authors.  If you like the mentioned authors, you'll probably like this read.
030758836X|5.0|Just when you think you got it figured out your wrong! This story was so unpredictable, witty and masterfully written.  I won't give anything away.  All I can say it read it!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Like Dennis Lehane in its use of detailed local color. Like Dennis Lehane in plot twists, realistic police procedures, violence, and depraved, vividly drawn characters. Like Jane Austen in her female protagonist's verbal agility and its clever observations on class and male-female relationships. Like both of them in being hard to put down and very funny. I can see Reese Witherspoon as perfect for the lead in the movie. But so much of what makes Gone Girl interesting is what goes on in people's minds, and that's done better in a book than a movie.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I don't like buying apps. so when I saw there were free angry birds and paid angry birds I went for the free one just in case. but I would buy the paid one if the free one was bad. its an excellent game and is a great time waster. I love playing all the different seasons its so fun. the game itself is five Star but beware of the ads other than that its the same as the paid one so save your money and get the free one!!!
0345803485|1.0|This book is AWFUL! I have NO IDEA why this was a best seller. The main character is annoying. There is hardly any action. It's a very boring read. Very disappointing.
B007N85POS|3.0|I got this angry birds Rio because usually better things cost more. my cousin also has the kindle fire and buys the 99 cents one. its the exact same thing. same game and all. if your like me and want to save moneys to buy other fun apps go for the 99 cents one. the game is awesome and is so fun and well made and is great for kids. but its not worth three bucks. go get the 99 cents one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was an amazing read! I couldn't put it down (I lost some sleep from staying up reading). I'm not much of a critic so I'll stop here lol...great book!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|so I love this app! I honestly don't think it should be free. I prefer this more then My Writing Spot, which I had to buy, and I think on Evernote its much more convenient and easier to find stuff. I love love love this app. I'm actually surprised I wrote a review for this app. I never do o.O, which shows this app is awesome :)
B00846REIS|1.0|This book was recommended to me and I wish I would've listened to the reviews in Amazon. I didn't like it at all!! This book has no storyline. It's just about crazy sex everywhere but the characters don't even seem to love each other. 50 Shades of Grey is 100% better.
B0063GORYU|5.0|fast, works perfectly. on kindle. great for those insomnia  nights. and pretty much anytime when I need quiet. time to myself.

0439023513|3.0|I want to like the ending of the Hunger Games trilogy. I really do. The books kept me gripped pretty much throughout, and I was looking forward to seeing how things wrapped up. Unfortunately, I don't like the ending. It felt a little too sure of its own point even though it doesn't really follow from the premises, and too many things felt like they were done for the convenience of this point moreso than because they flowed naturally. Things that could have been done more subtly and believably happened suddenly.<br /><br />**** SPOILERS ****<br />**** SPOILERS ****<br />**** SPOILERS ****<br /><br />Okay, let's start with Katniss' fabricated mission. It accomplished nothing except to make sure that Katniss was there to witness firsthand the most horrible event in her life. Major characters died left and right on this mission, to be promptly forgotten and never really mentioned again. And, in the end, it was literally for *nothing*. The rebels took the Capitol without any real help from Katniss' personal mission. However, Katniss was there to witness what happened to her sister. And therein lies the problem. Because the mission accomplished nothing else, it felt like it was manufactured by the author solely to get Katniss into position to witness this.<br /><br />And from there, the author just wraps things up as quickly as possible. Her mother and Gale? They make very brief appearances, provide no closure for their characters, and are gone. It was clear throughout that Gale was becoming as bad as those he fought against, but that point is never dealt with openly between the characters, even after it became clear that it was likely his bomb and his idea that made the horrible ending events possible.<br /><br />We're not really left with much of an idea of what happens with Panem after all this messy business is wrapped up. All we know is that she went back to District 12 and some people are moving back in there. The plot could conceivably make a point that revolutiondoesn't always change things. Given how insanely oppressive the Capitol was, however, it seems unlikely that the revolution would not have significantly improved the lot of thousands. It could even have concluded that pursuit of power leads to atrocities even from people who should be the good guys, that a desire for revenge can spoil even the best of us. But instead it takes a gigantic logical leap from the goings-on of the book to the conclusion that humans are just inherently bad creatures, ending on a note of utter hopelessness that really doesn't follow from what came before it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, in the effort to try to make this point, the book wound up handling the damage done to Peeta and Katniss very poorly. The damage that is done to their characters is not the natural result of being forced through not one but two rounds of the ghastly Hunger Games. Prior to book 3, both of them actually seem to be pretty psychologically okay.<br /><br />However, in order to end the book where some seem to want to argue it should end (because realistically someone would probably not be totally okay after this), Peeta is put through horrible torture and Katniss has to witness an horrific event. It is *these things* that derail them. They do not make a slow descent into despair or madness, brought about by the constant threats to their lives. Until this book, they cope remarkably well with all the horrors that are brought upon them. And then there is one thing that happens that is *immediately* too much for Katniss, despite having watched a number of friends die, some very recently. And perhaps this is why the ending feels a bit like a cheat, because the finish could have been arrived at naturally. Instead, the author felt like she had to throw in the one Really Bad Event that single-handedly unhinged Katniss.<br /><br />Still, I have to give the book credit, because it did keep me reading and it did leave me asking questions about the validity of its conclusion. Ifeel like the author dropped the ball on the ending it, but not so badly that I can't still recommend it. I just can't give it a resounding endorsement.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love this one,  its supost to be serious but its really funny and also like a great book hidden behind this little story you'll find the deepest truth about love, life and death.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Recommended to me by a friend and I highly recommend it to anyone with a brain and a spare thumb.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really enjoy how well this app works. It always holds the memory of my location, and just opening it up shows the current weather conditions and the projected forecasts for the next few days. The colors are bright and vivid and there's even an animated radar in it so you can see the movement of storms on the way. I find opening this app and using it far quicker than pulling up the weather on a website using a web browser. I use this on my Kindle Fire and it works perfectly on it.
B005LAII08|5.0|This is the best animated movie that I've seen in a very long time.  Besides Avengers this was the best movie to come out so far in 2012.  So much better than a certain batty film with so many plot holes and ludicrous contrivances.  This movie is worth the money, it's family friendly, and a great story.  I personally am so jaded when it comes to movies that it takes a lot to please me and I laughed out loud several times in the theaters.  There are also moments that are deeply moving... this movie deserves all 5 stars.
B007IXGUG0|5.0|Drake does it again! There aren't to many albums were I like most of the songs on it, but this is one! The collaborations, the beats, the lyrics, awesome!
B008ASLNN2|5.0|the movie was great BUT I wish there was a way to have subtitles for those of us who have difficulty hearing the dialogue when there is music being played during the dialogue.  Amazon , Netflix and other \\"downloaded\\" movies all have this problem. is there a solution? Thanks.
0316056863|2.0|I just don't get it. I never got Tina Fey but read the book hoping I would finally understand why people think she is funny. She continues not to be funny.<br /><br />The book, in way-too-large print to fill space, actually has way-too-many parts of SNL scripts in it because its only purpose is to make money, not actually to entertain anyone or really be interesting.
0345803493|5.0|The ending of book one left me needing to jump directly into this book.  I love how much ones emotions are toyed with.  I know we have all read about the works becoming a movie. I however think it would be a very successful TV series.  Come on ladies, who doesn't want a new taste of their life each week for many seasons. The books seemed to generate a life story.  Something that ended with so much more tale to tell.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|i've watched it for 3 days.their (christian and ana) relationship is interesting,this makes me enjoys a lot.<br />at first i thought fifty shades is similar to twilight,but turn out they're different from others.two charming rich man &two clumsy girl(:<br />this book is a lot different from nowadays fiction nolves,including many rude words&#60;-this is why i only give three stars<br />however i will still support this series of book because i'ma addicted already.
0345803507|5.0|I absolutely loved this whole series.  I really dont know what to read next.  Everything I try to get into has not captured my attention and interest like this series did.  I hope there will be more installments to come
B002BPRZU0|5.0|I am a Bonamossa fan. He has raised the bar for himself which means that anything new from him will need to be absolutly awesome. The guitar work is some of the best from anybody in years. The more I listen to each song, the harder it gets to pick my favorite song.

B0027MJU00|5.0|I had not heard of Gillian Flynn before, but as a fan of Blake Crouch, C.J. Box, Steven King, and other horror/suspense authors, I discovered Dark Places. Gillian's description of characters, especially Libby and Ben, is very vivid and creates strong, deep, and complex individuals. The murders are so vivid it is almost disturbing (and this is coming from a seasoned horror fanatic!). Flynn creates so much tension on the day of the murders, there are several different fronts of the story, seemingly speeding toward a collision with each other on that fateful January morning. There is so much tragedy going on and all the while knowing that these people will be so gruesomely murdered in mere hours is heart-breaking. There are so many twists, all masterfully written, that once you settle on a likely suspect, they soon become eliminated, and 2 or 3 more take their place as the possible killer. This book is one hell of a roller coaster ride! I actually did end up guessing who the killer was about 3/4 through the story, and though I was correct, it was not exactly for the reason I had guessed. I would highly recommend this book to all my fellow horror/murder mystery buffs! It's well worth $9.99!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I`ve read this book so fast I had to re~read it all over again which I had no problem with since it was sooooo good!!!  Trust me, you won`t just want to read it once, you will want to read it a lot of times.  This book is even good for adults too {my mom read it and loved it too} so there`s no excuse to not read this book.  It`s a must read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed this book. Of course it made me wanna buy the last book Mockingjay. I like how the author does not whitewash the real affect of trauma on the kids in the story.
0385344228|5.0|Andy Barber, the First Assistant District Attorney is a man of the law. As his former protege has put it, murder is the family business. Only Andy has hid from his wife Laurie, his child Jacob, his employer and the world in general a deep dark secret-his father is a notorious murderer, as was his father before him.<br /><br /> Has his son inherited a murder gene? That is the question when fourteen year old Jacob is charged in the deadly knifing of a bullying classmate. The evidence is there, but it is circumstantial and more importantly there are inferences that suggest young Jacob's actual innocence. While the title rightfully suggests courtroom pyrotechnics, at the heart of this tale is a father's anguished defense of nurture over nature. The man who became a lion at the prosecutor's table did so despite the family history of bloody hands. Can anyone truly believe his son could have done such a thing? Was his indictment more in response to office politics than good hard facts?<br /><br />We often forget that we are each the direct descendants of those who survived this brutal place we call earth. William Landay skillfully weaves this tale in Andy Barber's agonized voice as the narrative unfolds before a grand jury. Barber, the consummate tough prosecutor, defends Jacob because this is his son on whom so much of his own identity depends. In the end, this is Andy's defense of himself as much as of Jacob. It offers tight and credible a plot, a keen understanding of the dynamics of the criminal law, and a look into the mirror of a good man's soul which you will never forget.

B000063V8T|4.0|When I bought TNG Season 5 I wasn't to sure I was doing the right thing because I actually bought a previously owned set. I was very worried about the condition of the discs, etc. Would they be scratched? Are they going to skip?<br />Well, not to worry. The set was shipped immediately and surprisingly enough was wrapped in cellophane as if it were brand new.<br />All the discs are fine and play very well and I am anxious to order seasons 6 and 7. I will order both soon without hesitation. Thank you Amazon.com[[ASIN:B000063V8T Star Trek The Next Generation - The Complete Fifth Season]]

0061900656|5.0|My son, now 2yrs old, loves this book! As a mother, I think it helps him understand a little bit more about what's going on in his world. I see him piecing the concept together of having a baby sister. He likes the section about how he can eat pizza and apples and ice cream. I love when I read him the first page about who is new in our house and he tells me it's the big brother!<br /><br />My son's favorite part of this book is when the author points out pictures of the boy when he is little. My LO always looks on the wall , just above the bed, at the photos of when he was a baby. I think it really makes him feel special!<br /><br />This book does a great job helping my LO understand that he has lots of things he can do along with addressing the needs of a new baby. Plus, the illustrations are really cheerful, colorful and pleasing to look at. I highly recommend this book!
B001N26GFM|5.0|This film is a prodigy of horror wrapped up in love and that horror destroys this love forever by making it eternal in death.<br /><br />Two eight year old boys meet, one on the free side of the fence, the other one on the camp side of the fence of a \\"work camp\\" (a nice name indeed for a Konzentration Kamp) for Jews just when the final solution is introduced. In Germany<br /><br />I will neglect the side of the Commandant of the camp who is a SS and yet also has a personal life, a wife, two children, parents, a father who is on the good side and a mother who is clearly critical. A promotion for a SS officer is to become a camp Commandant and do, under strict secrecy, what is expected from him: to build a better German nation without any Jews, and if possible a world in the image of that German nation.<br /><br />The film shows very well how the whole ideology is built on propaganda, which is a pack of lies, or ,if you prefer a pack of lying wolves that are after you to get your souls down into hell, in the name of the Greater future of the German nation. There is not much to say about the details of that machine. The details are there, clear and obvious. No comment, just cry with rage at such dumb inhumanity, really for both sides, the German nation itself and their victims.<br /><br />The film is a lot more interesting with the eight year old son of that SS Commandant who escapes from the home of Herr Kommandant to  explore the forest behind the mansion and come to the fence where he discovers an eight year old Jewish boy who is hungry and sad, Shmuel. Shmuel has nothing to learn about the life outside the camp, but the other boy, Bruno, has to discover what the camp is and that it is no YMCA simmer camp. That takes time and a treason in the middle, but boys will be boys and they will invent a project to come together. Since Shmuel cannot come to the outside why not Bruno going into the camp.<br /><br />And that will be the drama. No survivors please with the final solution, and frankly it's better like that. Which of the two boys could have survived without being damaged for life, or till death ensues.<br /><br />And the film can end on the tears of the mother and sister and on the despair of the SS Commandant of a father. We will not be given the logical end for him after such a tragedy. Death at times can be sweet and desirable.<br /><br />This is a masterpiece of poignancy even if suspense (who cares about suspense in a subject we all know by heart and regret with all our hearts) is rather light because boys will be boys and boys have always been boys. And love, or call it friendship if you prefer being a prude, has no limits, no divides, no abyss in the middle. Love is unified by definition and love comes no matter what and is for life and death. Happy are those who can share a life full of discoveries and then a death full of satisfaction. I am afraid the two boys met in death with apprehension and fear but a lot of courage in their acceptance of that fate as being a fate in which they can hold hands, and they did, naked under the fumes of the death-inflicting shower.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUsolution, and frankly it's better like that.

0345803485|1.0|I have to admit I was shocked by Fifty Shades of Grey. However, it wasn't the sex that was the turnoff. It was the poor writing. I don't think I've ever encountered so many \\"murmuring\\" characters in all of literature. The plot was thin and the characters were one-dimensional. If it were not for the sex, I'm not sure anyone would spend their time, let alone their money, to read this novel. One thing I know for certain - James is laughing all the way to the bank.

B000SEI230|3.0|This is not my first time around the block with a Nicholas Sparks' novel. I have read a few of his other works and seen the movies adaptations. Since I have seen the movie version of A Walk to Remember, I was prepared for the sadness and the angst. However, I wasn't as heartbroken as I thought I was going to be. Instead I felt sort of indifferent to it.<br /><br />There are several reasons why I was so undecided with this book. I had seen the movie with Shane West (heyyy boy) and Mandy Moore and I loved it. I had actual tears when I watched the movie and so I believe the element of surprise was already ruined for me and I knew what to expect.<br /><br />Another reason I was very matter-of-fact with A Walk to Remember could be because I'm already used to the depressing and heartbreaking story line and sometimes I don't even bat an eyelash. I like to think it's the first reason though; I don't like thinking I have such a cold heart.<br /><br />I did enjoy the book, though. I found myself sighing at Landon when he was being sweet and tender to Jamie. Especially when they first kissed. So sweetttt....<br /><br />\\"Instead of moving towards the chairs, I took a step closer to her and found myself reaching for her hand. I took it in mine and looked right at her, moving just a little closer. She didn't exactly step back, but her eyes widened just a little, and for a moment, a tiny flickering moment I thought I'd done the wrong thing and debated going any further. I paused and smiled, sort of tilting my to the side, and next thing I saw was that she'd closed her eyes and was tilting her head, too, and that our faces were moving closer together.<br />It wasn't that long, and it certainly wasn't the kind of kiss you see in movies these days, but it was wonderful in its own way, and all I can remember about the moment is that when our lips first touched, I knew the memory would last forever.\\"<br /><br />I love the simplicity of their courtship. The book is set in the late 1950s, and Jamie is the minister's daughter so their relationship is very chaste. I enjoyed reading the book in a male's POV. I tend to read a lot of female main characters so this was refreshing. Landon was supposed to be your typical bad boy but I just giggled because the people of Beaufort  in the fifties had very different measures of a bad boy.<br /><br />\\"....that was the kind of thing that made other parents shake their heads and whisper to their children, \\"You don't want to be like that Carter boy. He's on the fast track to prison.\\"<br />Me. A bad boy. For eating boiled peanuts in the graveyard. Go figure.\\"<br /><br />My favorite part was right at the end, when Landon figured out what he had to do. I felt myself anticipating Landon's next move, which I believe is a great way to see how Mr. Sparks has the reader hooked on his work. I was finally tearing up while Landon was prefacing his request to Jamie.<br /><br />\\"Do you love me?\\" I asked her.<br />She smiled. \\"Yes.\\"<br />\\"Do you want me to be happy?\\"<br />As I asked her this, I felt my heart beginning to race.<br />\\"Of course I do.\\"<br />\\"Will you do something for me then?\\" She looked away, sadness crossing her features. \\"I don't know if I can anymore.\\"<br />\\"But if you could, would you?\\"<br />I cannot adequately describe the intensity of what I was feeling at that moment. Love, anger, sadness, hope, and fear, whirling together, sharpened by the nervousness I was feeling. Jamie looked at me curiously, and my breaths became shallower. Suddenly I knew that I'd never felt as strongly for another person as I did at that moment.\\"<br /><br />~~~<br /><br />\\"....what I wanted to do was give her something that she'd always wanted.<br />It was what my heart had been telling me to do all along.<br />Jamie, I understood then, had already given me the answer I'd been searching for, the one my heart had needed to find. She'd told me the answer as we'd sat outside Mr. Jenkins's office, the night we'd ask him about the play.\\"<br /><br />I know this isn't my last read of Mr. Sparks's work. I thoroughly enjoy his novels and A Walk to Remember was definitely refreshingly different and normal amid all the paranormal and dystopian that I'm currently reading.<br /><br />I know this isn't my last read of Mr. Sparks's work.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|First, if you haven't had the pleasure of watching Breaking Bad, do yourself a favor. Start from episode 1, season 1. And if you've completed the first three seasons, you don't need my encouragement to watch season 4. Except to say this. The waxing tension, the increasingly complex character portraits, the uncertainties of person and plot, build to a masterfully lethal season climax. One of the great series ever does itself proud in season 4. I wish I could go back and watch it again for the first time.

0307592731|5.0|The memoir WILD by Cheryl Strayed is heartbreaking and inspiring.  The author's writing is poetic and profound, and at other moments no-holds-barred frank and then even at turns educational, demonstrating Strayed possesses a writer's voice that is unique, refreshing and outright exquisite.<br /><br />This story chronicles the author's hiking excursion--all 1,100 miles of it--along the Pacific Crest Trail, known as the \\"PCT.\\"  This is a path that goes from the Mexico/California border all the way up to just past the Canadian border, and the trail crosses through numerous mountain ranges.<br /><br />At the age of 26, Strayed resolved to hike the PCT without taking along a hiking partner and with a goal of finishing the trip in around 100 days--even though the amount of experience she had with overnight backpacking was ... zilch.<br /><br />Strayed herself called this an \\"arguably unreasonable decision.\\"  It came after a series of emotionally devastating events that caused the author to react with destructive behavior.  The inciting occurrence was four years prior when her mom died at a young age from cancer, which then led to the unraveling relationship between herself and the remaining family members, and the beginning of the end of her marriage.  Strayed's feelings of deep pain and emptiness drove her to sleep around--with several men and while she was married.  One of the lovers introduced her to shooting heroin and also impregnated her; the outcome of that was an elective abortion.<br /><br />The author believed trekking solo through \\"the wild\\" on the Pacific Crest Trail would be a way to \\"save\\" her.<br /><br />The \\"pre-PCT\\" upheavals are introduced at the beginning of the memoir to show the reasoning behind the \\"why\\" of the hike, and they are explored further in various chapters via short flashback scenes or sometimes by just one or two sentences.  Memories of these loved ones and incidents would be triggered when the author would come to a particular spot on thetrail, either one of surreal serenity and beauty, or a destination that had required an extra-super physical challenge to get there.  Strayed would then endure the heartache, anger and regret from the previous years all over again, but she would also at times arrive at an \\"Ah-ha!\\" moment of understanding and acceptance about her life--which in the end did indeed lead to the author's \\"saving\\" as she had hoped.<br /><br />Some of the passages in WILD that hit home on the author's discoveries during her hike or that highlight Strayed's fantastic writer's voice are:<br /><br />\\"He broke her nose.  He broke her dishes. ... But he didn't break her.\\"<br /><br />\\"The loss of my family and home were my own private clear-cut.  What remained was only ugly evidence of a thing that was no more.\\"<br /><br />\\"He hadn't loved me well in the end, but he'd loved me well when it mattered.\\"<br /><br />\\"Now my backpack had a name: Monster. ... I was amazed that what I needed to survive could be carried on my back.  And, most surprising of all, that I could carry it.  That I could bear the unbearable.  These realizations about my physical, material life couldn't help but spill over into the emotional and spiritual realm.  That my complicated life could be made so simple was astounding.\\"<br /><br />\\"I went to the river and squatted down and splashed my face. ... Where was my mother? I wondered.  I'd carried her so long, staggering beneath her weight.  On the other side of the river, I let myself think.  And something inside of me released.\\"<br /><br />\\"Another toenail looked like it was finally going to come off.  I gave it a gentle tug and it was in my hand, my sixth.  I had only four intact toenails left.  The PCT and I weren't tied anymore.  The score was 4-6, advantage trail.\\"<br /><br />Strayed's memoir WILD is a book I'm definitely wild about and one that I will encourage all my friends and family to read.  Her writing style is truly wonderful, and I eagerly look forward to enjoying her novel TORCH.

Hope this helps.
0374531269|2.0|shame on the publisher.. This book was a fraud.I have read Ishmael's book,was he really as a kid forced to joined those crazy gun-brandishing killer bandits? Ishael Beah,lied just to make money for himself and his sponsors. Plain and simple.<br />Did he exploits the goodwill of the compassionate western people? Why did the people from his own country doubt him,it is hard to believe the guy or take him really serious at all.<br /><br />Koko
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is amazing on kindle fire it looks dumb but its really addicting so get it its great for kids terns and really anyone
1451627297|5.0|I was 60% through the book eight hours ago.  I stayed up all night reading.  This is the first time I cried when I was reading a book, it's that good and that gut wrenching.  I'm not sure if I can read another Stephen King novel after this one.  I don't see how he can top it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Surprisingly, this helps me go to sleep :) I luv the sounds and I like that I can put it on sleep mode

B007KCG7MQ|5.0|First of all, instead of there being 5 Stars for the rating system, this CD needs at LEAST 12!! To say that Joe Walsh is back is like saying the Pope is Catholic. If Joe is changing it's only because he's getting BETTER, if that's possible. The first week I got this CD I played it over so many times that it burned up my CD player...well almost. I knew, from previewing it on Amazon that it was going to be good, but not THIS good. Joe Walsh has a way of making everyday things funny and yet...profound at the same time like in the first song, Analog Man, when he talks about his frustrations with \\"the digital world\\" and having to get \\"some 10 year old smartass\\" to tell him what to do. Ha!, gotta love it. On the track \\"One day at a Time\\" he tells us about how his life, and love, has changed for the better. Yeah, we can tell Joe, just from your music that your life is good and that \\"it feels pretty good being me\\".  Thank you Joe, for being you and making OUR lives better for it!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|For the first couple hundred pages, this was as good a book as I'd read in a while.  Interesting characters, awesome plot twists, tons of suspense, great pacing.<br /><br />But I was just incredibly disappointed with how the author wrapped everything up at the end.  It just feels like there was a better way to tie everything together and bring closure to the mystery.  So, a 5 star book becomes a 3 star book.  Yeah, the ending was that disappointing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|there are ads between every game but thay are easy to skip. overall its a great app for anyone who loves solitaire.
B001GZ6QEC|2.0|I bought this blue ray disc  and te movie disc doesnt play. Te special features plays perfectly but I am not able to play te movie!
0525423656|2.0|I tried... I really tried to read this book, but suddenly found that I, (an on-going pleasure-reader), was simply not reading at all. This went on for months, and I figured I just wasn't into reading as much anymore. Half way through this book, I began reading another, and realized that this wasn't true.<br />I loved \\"Matched\\" but, my God, this book was so boring and seemed never-ending. Maybe it gets better at the end, I don't know? But I can say that MOST of this book is redundant nothing-ness.
B002VQ7PVS|5.0|My husband and I both enjoyed this book.  It is so well written and holds your attention from beginning to the end.  I highly recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its awesome<br />in every way shape or form<br />I want to play it 24/7<br />I cant delete cud its awesome
B0000714BP|5.0|Wonderful movie! Always love a good drag movie! Lol Just wish this was an instant video to watch or at least re-done in bluray.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I can't get enough off my kindle to even load it!  My Grandson is very disappointed!  I have just removed every app, video, magazine, many songs and all but 5 books and there still is not enough room for it to load!  Money back please.  Trying to see how to get a refund since it won't even load!
B00881VLCE|3.0|I would love to have at least one more size option. Otherwise enjoy it. Pictures are really nice. Good photography!
1608871045|5.0|I am vey satisfied with the book! It comes with awesome movie memborillia and inside fact from all three films! It goes in depth of the GCPD files and files from the Batcave! A must for all Batman fans and movie goers! Love it!
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I advise u not to get this game i was playing and i had to go to churchI tried to back to my home screen and I couldn't so I tried to pwr it off but it froze and I had to wait 20 minutes before I could shut it down<br /> if it does this, hold the pwr button down for 20 second and it amediatly shuts it off and when you turn it back on delete this app it has viruses and many problems
0439023521|5.0|This is a great easy to read series.  It is a pretty \\"dark\\" story.  As a child psychotherapist I wonder about children reading stories with such a pessimistic future.  I don't know that they see it as a warning to change our ways, but more as it being inevitable.  I can't put it down so it is certainly and interesting series.  I am now on book three.  Since they are kids books it goes fast.
B007K3JCAE|2.0|I love this movie but I am not happy with the UltraViolet copy.  I cannot use it with iTunes to transfer the file to my iPod classic and UltraViolet is unable to work with me on the issue, just telling me how I could use it if my device was newer and could support apps.  Not helpful.<br />I will never buy another movie with an UltraViolet (not digital which I could use at my discretion) copy.  I am very disappointed.
0307408833|1.0|I had such high hopes for these cupcakes, especially after spending $100 at multiple stores on all the hard-to-find ingredients. I made the basic vanilla cupcake recipe, which supposedly the owner of Babycakes used as the base recipe for all other flavors. I sure hope not because these cupcakes are disgusting. There is no way anyone is making a living off of these awful cupcakes. They are gummy and flavorless and started to burn before the 22 minutes they were supposed to bake. The frosting actually made me gag. It was super liquid-y and tasted like pure coconut oil combined with the horrible flavor of unsweetened soy. Let me just say that soy milk powder should never be used to make anything that is going to be consumed by a human. I tried to save it by adding coconut sugar and more vanilla extract, but it was still horrible.<br /><br />I second the other reviews in that it would've been nice if they used their ACTUAL recipes but I guess if they did that, people would be ripping them off left and right and then they wouldn't have a successful business anymore! Do yourself a favor and just Google some vegan/gluten-free recipes. Even if they're colossal failures, a least you can save yourself the cost of this book.
0345803507|2.0|I found the books to be poorly written and full of repeats.  After finishing the first book,  I did not plan to read the second.  I was told that the second book was better and to give it a try.  I did and it was painful.  I ended up skimming most of it because it was so predictable and poorly written.<br /><br />Both of the books were VERY unrealistic. I have no intention of reading the third book.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|The new Bushnell Tour V2 lives up to everything they say it will do. To date, I have not had any trouble hitting a flag with this product.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put this book down...excellent suspense with a twist. It felt very realistic and centers upon raw human emotions. Recommending this to my friends and family!
B005869U6G|5.0|Quite a different approach for this band. I agree, I love their harder edged side but this is a great artistic journey for this band who just have an amazingly playful sexy sound. It is well worth the purchase and the more I listened to it, the more I fell in love with it. I think I will not tire of it for the long haul. I hear a lot of grumbles from fans but I think this makes me excited to see what is next, they are willing to take chances and explore their talents. I think this is what makes great artists.
030758836X|5.0|This book was very well written and I couldn't stop reading it.<br />All the details and the human psyque really keep you attached to it until the end.<br />I felt manupalted into loving and hating the protagonists and I thought the way she writes was genius.<br />I recommend it!
0099579936|2.0|it cannot be a bestseller, can be a beach read though. you can read such harlequin-like books for summer, but you shall not expect more.. no original plot, nothing to wait till the last page; just endless erotic scenes.. shame to call it \\"original in its own sense\\"..
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book!  Read all three in the Hunger Games series, and they were fabulous!  Cannot wait to see<br />the Hunger Games movie now. Nice to have on the Kindle.
B008JAFXOQ|1.0|Depressing and annoying.  This movie is too much like real life.  It reminds me of the worst times of my life.  Watch something uplifting rather than this...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I am wishing for more levels, beauty of a game on my tablet. it is a challenging game, simple premise.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great series! Loved it!! I am not usually a reader, but I read all 3 of the Fifty Shades books and couldn't stop!! I think it has a great story in it aside from the steaminess :)
B007IXWL2C|1.0|One of the worst endings.  I managed to wade through the duplication while giving the author the benefit of the doubt.  This whole story is pretty adolescent.  Then after all THIS SHE HAS NO ENDING! What a waste if time and money this was.  I recommended it to my wife after book one and when she gets to the end I'll have to listen to her bitch for a week!  EL had better stay with TV as she has no future as an author other than writing porn.  This is the last of her books I will ever buy!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I should go do something productive...like clean my house - do laundry - fix dinner :-) but I can't stop playing.

B001OFJPIS|5.0|Yes, we all know that this movie was intended for 6th graders with their evil little minds, but some of us adults still think like 6th graders, and I really liked his abs. Smirk, smirk.
B00632HWOG|2.0|i used this to chek my email on my kindle fire and it didnt even tell me i had all my new messages. it slowed down mynkindle fire and just irritated me.
B000J10KTQ|5.0|Now a lot of people bash this movie for being boring, not enough action.  But any true superman fan will tell you, the movies were never about the action.  It was always more about the story, the triumph that good has over evil, the love story with Lois Lane.  Now Singer impressed me with the X-Men movies, and i'm happy that he did this one.  He did the series justice.  I was pretty happy with all of the actors in the movie, think they all did a good job.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I read this at the recommendation of a friend.  It is unique writing. It is suspenseful.  It's a women's book.  The use of magic makes you want what is not possible come true.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Sherlock seasons 1 (and season 2, for that matter) is brilliant. The acting is fantastic, the modernized changes are really well done, and even the music is fantastic. I definitely recommend it. You'll get hooked, and then join tumblr in fangirling all over Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I read the books to see what the hype was about. I didn't think I was as fantastic as what I had heard however I'm glad I read them all the same.<br />I found the use of words quite repetitve (cocked his head to one side, peeked up at him, I/he fist/s in his/my hair, the apex of my thighs etc...)hence I feel a thersaurus would have been handy. There was a few editorial errors such as open quotations followed by another set of open quotation before closing the last set, so every now and then I was a bit lost on who was saying what.<br />All in all though, I must give E.L James credit. Having no experience in writing, and what started out as an on line blog type thing, she's done extremely well and for that I gave her the 4 stars. I'd still recommend reading it, after all, no one likes being left out of the hype :)
1401235417|5.0|This is a great new start for Batman in the new 52, all praises due for Scott Snyder. I can't remember the last time I've seen in this way. Must read for any Batman fan.
1594744769|4.0|Is it in bad taste to say that I found Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children peculiar? I suppose it is, but it had to be done :P<br /><br />I rather enjoyed the idea of a story that was assisted by the use of pictures. In reality, though, it ended up being a hit and miss for me. All the pictures themselves were great, but sometimes they didn't quite work with the story. Sometimes the pictures were a nice addition to the story and sometimes it felt like the story was working just a little too hard to incorporate them.<br /><br />The story itself, on the other hand, was fantastic. I loved the originality of the storyline. Riggs has some serious craziness up his sleeve. Going in I was just thinking there might just be some peculiar and creepy ghosts of children, but boy was I wrong. This story has some serious depth.<br /><br />The Nutshell: Looking at the cover and reading the description you can imagine that Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children has the creep factor going for it, but there's a lot more between the covers as well. There's a crazy fantastical story, a little mystery, a smidge of romance, and lurking-in-the-shadows nightmares. If you're looking for a strange, slightly spooky original story then Miss Peregrine's is worth looking into.<br /><br />Hit
B0063GORYU|4.0|I have enjoyed the challenge of this game.  This game has been a favorite for many years. play it for yourself and enjoy.
B004U52VPS|5.0|My grandkids, age 4, 7 and 9 love this game.<br /><br />They often don't use the rules. Instead they enjoy creatively building structures for the Angry Birds to knock down. This stimulates thinking about geometry and architecture.
B007DIQC90|5.0|A great CD!!  No disappointment here!!  They have their own very distinct sound and the lyrics reflect their culture.  Don't hesitate!!
B0052VUNHC|1.0|Possibly a good read for a person living through those teenage angst years. Ridiculous book with absolutely no content. Just went on and on about nothing really
B008JGSM6G|5.0|my 6 and 8 year old daughters love the challenge of the game.  I love the thinking skills and problem solving skills they are using.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was an excellent read!  I have a love/hate relationship with this kind of book... I love how it grabs your attention and continues to draw you in, but I hate how tired I am the next day because I wasn't able to put the book down!
B008JGSM6G|2.0|Even the &quot;hard&quot; puzzles are too easy. Sorry. Neat idea but it must have looked better on paper. I would not recommend.
0345529057|5.0|By no means am I a fantasy-genre reader...not a \\"dragon\\" type person. I had no idea what I was getting into, having never seen the TV show (but knowing that everyone who saw it loved it). Bought these on recommendation of everyone I knew who read them.<br /><br />I find the books are well written. Because I had not seen the TV show, it took me a few chapters to get figure out that Ned and Eddard are the same person.<br /><br />The writing is very dense, and usually I can get through a 700-900 page book in a few days, week at most...these take me several weeks. The writing is so vivid and thick with details, that I often feel exhausted after reading one or two chapters.<br /><br />Like any book, there are parts that are better than others, and characters that I like better than others.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this box set, because for $21 you get the first 4 books, which is a great deal considering that the books are between $8-$12 a piece. I knew I was taking a big leap buying 4 books of a series I knew nothing about, but I'm glad I did!<br /><br />Can't wait to finish #3, and get on with 4 and so on and so on!
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|This charger works for me and has not frayed or broken like some people's apparently have. If yours does though, or if you simply don't want to buy this charger, fortunately LG phone chargers have the same plug so you can use them to charge your kindle.
B005I6EU48|5.0|Great product as it was exactly what I was looking for, Nice looking protection for the screen while it's in my purse.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|Pretty good pop album.  My only complaint is the excessive use of auto-tune, but it actually benefits a couple songs.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game so much! Its so much fun! I like playing it when i get bored and have nothing else to do. Love it.
B003EW4KAW|1.0|WASTED $$.$$ on favorite Rolling Stones -Sticky Fingers Album SACD from Universal/Japan expecting amazing stellar sound quality and instead I heard a bright fatigue inducing SACD that sounds as if it were sourced from a 500th generation 1980's red-book CD.  In fact the 1994 Virgin records remaster CD sounds better than this piece of crap as does a digitally mastered vinyl copy of Sticky Fingers from a few years ago. Unfortunately this is not the first Japanese Universal SACD that I have been ripped off on. It is however the last I will ever purchase from them again. Just to make sure it wasn't my system at fault I brought the disc over to a friend at a local HiFi shop and he played it back on $12,000 state of the art SACD player in a $75,000 Hi-end stereo system. We were both astonished at the horrible sound reproduction from this SACD when compared with Virgin USA CD from the 1990's.    BUYER BEWARE!    THE ABOVE REVIEW WAS WRITTEN ABOUT THE TERRIBLE SOUND QUALITY OF THE WAY OVERPRICED JAPANESE IMPORT SACD NOT THE FANTASTIC SOUNDING OUT OF PRINT ABKO HYBRID SACD FROM 2003 ROLLING STONES STICKY FINGERS ALBUM WHICH IS A TEN STAR ALBUM! It's not my fault that Amazon lumps all reviews of different formats onto the same page so customers can't tell what's what?     Please consider this fact when reading reviews on this website before leaving negative comments like the knucklehead below!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I had the Weather Channel App but didn't like it much because:<br />1. It had some weird permission requirements (didn't feel safe)<br />2. Well, #1 is good enough...<br />This app has some very nice graphics. Displays a lot of information (more than other apps). You can have multiple cities and States (super easy to change from city to city, just swipe the screen)
B007SGM084|5.0|The trilogy was an enjoyable and quick read. I am not sure if should have been banned in some areas.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a well written, thought provoking book that you just want to keep reading. It has multiple layers to the story which help to paint a unique sci-fi world.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is so much fun! it's freaking addictive. just be careful not to buy anything with real money. takes a while to collect money and upgrade your stuff. but other than that, the game is awesome.
B001TH16DI|4.0|Picture and sound quality are good, as to be expected from BD, BUT...<br /><br />Before you buy this, be aware that these are the THEATRICAL versions of the movies, and NOT the director's cuts.  I was disappointed when I popped in Wrath of Kahn and realized that the scene with Scotty's nephew was missing.  (I was even more upset because I had traded in my director's cut DVD's to replace them with these BD's.)
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is so complicated you just can't stop playing. I love it. I would recommend this to any one who likes mazes or solving problems
0553284347|5.0|I bought this book a few years ago.  I found that it help me see that my parents really went overboard with me, but confronting them was the worst thing I did.  I used other suggestions and my mother was able to see that, and in her mind, I was being smart with her, so she changed her tactic and got physical with me.  This really broke me down some more.  I did a second confrontation many years later and my mother implied that I need mental medical attention.  Get this, my mother works for the Toronto Catholic School Board. If they only knew....
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Several years ago I tried to picture what a Beach Boys reunion would be like.  I thought that even without Dennis and Carl, they would still have enough good voices to make a really nice record, if they just had good songs, good production, and so on.  (Back in the 70's they did most of M.I.U. album with only Brian, Mike and Al Jardine participating!)<br /><br />But even last year Brian was trash-talking the idea of any reunion, saying he hated the idea.  And then suddenly I heard that they would release an album.  Then I heard Bruce Johnston say the new album reminded him of Sunflower, which was strange, why would he reference such an obscure and underrated album.  And so here it is.  I think most everybody is in a way humbled and heartened by this album, at such a late stage in the game, when you thought it would never be possible.  You can still, at the end of the day, mend your family fences, and pull together again, and relive all the great memories.<br /><br />I've been listening to this album all summer, and what a perfect soundtrack to summer, and to life.  \\"Summer's Gone\\" is really the emotional capstone of the album.  The pureness of the Brian Wilson vocal has an unearthly, undisturbed resemblance to the Brian Wilson vocals of 1965, even before Pet Sounds. How is that possible?  The song has the simple, rushing innocence of \\"Please Let Me Wonder\\", \\"I'm So Young,\\" and \\"We'll Run Away\\".  The teenage emotions that I used to know.  It is masterful that the Beach Boys could get back to that sound and feeling.<br /><br />So many great moments on the record.  The opening notes to \\"Pacific Coast Highway\\" sound like \\"And Your Dreams Come True\\" or \\"Our Prayer\\".  And the title track, with its faux simplicity, melding the \\"Surfer Girl\\", Four Freshmen-centric era of the group with a complex Sunflower-esqe fade at the end.<br /><br />Most reviewers on here have not even mentioned \\"From There to Back Again\\" which lays on some thick chords and yearning which brings to mind \\"The Night Was So Young\\" from \\"Love You\\" (see if you can spot a common lick in both songs).  It has a fantastic Al Jardine vocal.<br /><br />Tunes like \\"Beaches in Mind\\" and \\"Isn't It Time\\" and \\"Strange World\\" are all emotionally uncomplicated, but they are catchy, and they are always in my head during the day.  That's the sign of a good record.  And tunes like \\"Bill and Sue\\" and \\"Shelter\\" still show that Brian can still come up with a unique point of view or subject matter for a song, and are just gently weird enough to remind you of why he's probably a genius.<br /><br />Find the interview with Joe Thomas who talks about the making of this album.  He said that the title track was written over a decade ago, and saved all these years for the Beach Boys.  He also said that this record is not meant to be the end.  Brian was excited by the project and wants to maybe do another one.<br /><br />I would like to see the exact vocal credits on this record someday.  Jeff Foskett is of course a big presence on this album, and there are other singers from Brian's band involved in some of the sweetening and thickening.  And there is an odd voice in the harmonic mix on \\"Beaches in Mind\\" that I just can't place, I swear it is Jimmy Buffet.  Not to mention auto tune, but that is just another tool for effect, like the vocal double-tracking of old.  None of this detracts from such a fantastic album, so thank you Beach Boys for giving us one more go round for all the fans who wondered and hoped for years, for just one more magical moment in your California journey.  Thank you.
0066620996|5.0|Good deal, great book, great shape, great price. The book was sent to me same day and I received the boom promptly.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|amazing best if your writing a book or novel on the go, orginized and reliable. amazing and has a sort of built in cloud based storage, an overall great product.
030758836X|2.0|I wanted a great vacation read and this book kept coming up. Bought it... and I was entertained for most of the book. Definitely written in an interesting manner as the characters unfold and we get to know them(or do we?)as we turn the pages. The author lets out information a little at a time which keeps you involved and wondering what is going on. You believe one way, then another. Your suspicions and your loyalties change as you read. Then- you get to the end. COMPLETELY unbelievable ending. Just made me feel like I had wasted some good vacation reading time.
B001F3FZVK|3.0|I'm sure that this is a great album.  It was when it was first released.  However, as it didn't download after three tries, I have given up on it .  I've also given up on downloading any more.  Maybe it's my crappy wild blue satellite connection.  Maybe not.
B0067QPVJ6|3.0|So this is a prequel to a John Carpenter classic made in 1982. Or some may call it a \\"remake,\\" judging from the plotline. Whichever it is, comparison seems inevitable as Carpenter's version holds a special place in many fan's hearts. (The original currently scores an average of 8.2 points out of 10 on imdb.) And so many reviewers have already done great jobs, comparing two versions, so I think I will judge the film on its own merits. So how good is this sci-fi thriller?<br /><br />The story of \\"The Thing\\" (2011) unfolds pretty fast. Mary Elizabeth Winstead (who slightly looks like young Sigourney Weaver) is Dr. Kate Lloyd, an American paleontologist, who is called in by Dr. Sander Halvorson (Ulrich Thomsen) for a research project about a recently discovered object that had crashed-landed in the Antarctic about 100,000 years ago.<br /><br />\\"The Thing\\" has a few scary moments indeed, but the film quickly becomes cliché once we learn what the \\"Thing\\" can do. The visual effects of the \\"Thing\\" is impressive, but the film shows it too early and too much. Director Matthijs van Heijningen Jr. (his feature debut) somehow refuses to create a claustrophobic environment that the film's \\"Alien\\"-like scenario seems to need. Instead of that, he opts for a more action-filled storyline, especially in the film's climax, where things look confusing and even silly.<br /><br />The film is not terrible - at least it is not boring. At the same time, however, \\"The Thing\\" often looks generic, borrowing bits here and there from other sci-fi thrillers. \\"The Thing\\" is reasonably entertaining, but lacks creativity and imagination.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Oh, how I wish for negative stars, Amazon requires one star when rating items, say it isn't so...<br /><br />Although literary crap is typically not my genre, after hearing so much hoopla about this trilogy, I thought I'd better check it out...sorry I did. The prose is juvenile to say the least, after reading about Ana \\"biting her lip\\" and Christian wanting to spank her for it so many times, I began to wish that he would just beat the crap out of her and be done with it for heaven's sake so I would never have to hear about it again. Since I find violence against women (or against anyone, really) abhorrent, I figured this was probably not the trio for me.<br /><br />The book is repetitious and without direction, if you must read it, a good glass of wine might make one forget how uninteresting this book is. Do yourself a favor and stick to authors such as Elizabeth George or Richard North Patterson, you won't be sorry.<br /><br />(O.K. haters, I know not everyone has the same taste so you needn't reply and tell me this, its just that this book is so very bad!)

B00526ZKYS|2.0|This book was not worth its $9.99 price. It was depressing and I did not believe the love story at all. I will not be buying or reading the rest of the series.

B005LAIH54|3.0|Perseus (Sam Worthington) has chosen the life of a simple fisherman and the life a human with his family of his wife and son.  His wife dies and he is left to raise his young 10 year old son.  One evening he senses his father, the god Zeus (Liam Neeson), and goes into the house to see Zeus looking over his earthly grandson.  Zeus tells him that times are changing, that danger is near at hand and that he will need the support of Perseus, his son, to help save the Earth from the Titans.  Perseus tells him that he would rather be left alone and to be a father to his son.  Zeus warns him that the gods are losing their power and immortality due to the lack of belief in the gods by humanity.<br /><br />Zeus and Poseidon find themselves trapped through betrayal by Hades and Ares who have promised to free the imprisoned Kronos who has promised them that they can retain their powers and immortality if they free him.  Ares, who is Zeus's son and the god of war, is jealous of Perseus who is a demigod and Zeus's son also.  Perseus is reluctantly forced into battle to save not only Zeus but also all of mankind from the power of the titans and most of all Kronos.....<br /><br />This movie was just OK and that is a shame as it had real potential.  Some of the actors just seemed to be going through their roles without real spirit and the script drags at times.  The special effects are very good but oddly enough for me to say there may have been too many special effects and too little real acting and storytelling.  Too much time was spent on making a spectacular movie with dynamic special effects for the monsters and more time should have been spent on the plot, character development and the love angle with Perseus and Andromeda.  With today's movie making technology you have come to expect great special effects but with such a big name cast I expected a better script, better acting and better storyline development.<br /><br />The movie is entertaining but it just doesn't stand out from all the really good movies of the same genre.  It falls somewhere between a 3 and a 4 star movie but it is closer to a 3 star rating.  Would I watch the movie?  The answer is yes.  Would I watch it 2 or 3 times?  Probably not.from all the really good movies of the same genre.  It falls somewhere between a 3 and a 4 star movie but it is closer to a 3 star rating.  Would I watch the movie?  The answer is yes.

1468161660|5.0|I started this book last night and could not put it down. It was incredible! In recent months I've found myself gravitating towards this genre (New Adult) instead of my typical paranormal go to books. I've heard A LOT about this book in recent months and just hadn't gotten around to reading it. I was also a bit concerned that it wouldn't live up to the hype. Well it lived up to and far exceeded my expectations. From the very first page I couldn't get to the next one fast enough. I loved Layken (and her name). I think a lot of times the heroine can come across as whiny and annoying. I didn't feel that with Layken. She felt, to me, like a normal eighteen year old going through some of the most traumatic events of her life and overall she handled them very well. Eddie is a hoot and I wish I had a best friend just like her. Will is... Wonderful. He's not the alpha male type, he doesn't try to possess Lake, he's incredibly understanding and he always puts everyone else before himself.  I can not wait to start to the next book even though I'm a bit reluctant. Reluctant? Why would I be reluctant? Because the 3rd book isn't out yet that's why! *pouts* Seriously, this is one the best books I've read in a while and I think it will be very few people who don't enjoy it.

B0040T7CFS|4.0|It was about a month ago that I ordered and received the 2010 Bach Complete Edition. Overall I must say that I'm particularly  pleased with this collection of works. Indeed it was to my disappointment to find a few BWV works missing, however the set is a gem by all accounts.<br />Hans Fagius serves as the organist for every organ work (close to 300 tracks of music). His recordings of the massive preludes and fugues are superb, as well as the chorales and such. I find his recording of the Wedge (BWV 548) to be particularly pleasing.<br />I am very pleased with the recording of the st. Matthew Passion, as well. I've never heard a Passion in full that used all Baroque instruments. Unique indeed. The St. John Passion is a bit different for my taste---I was used to John Elliot Gardner's conduction with the Monteverdi Choir. Jesus, in this recording, is a bit too 'bass-y' and his vibrato tends to get bothersome, but other than that...Stephen Varcoe does a brilliant job as Pilate---it was Gardner's recording that used Varcoe as Jesus. Anyone know what I'm talking about?<br />As far as bad news...the box wasn't as sturdy as I thought it would be. It was not falling apart---hasn't yet---and one corner is on the verge  of being torn away. All the CDs were there, which was good, however with the DVD sets, the second which is the St. John Passion begins with O Mensch Bewien Dein Sunden Gross. 1725 Version...which I still don't understand.<br />I haven't listened to the Cantatas in full, but it's fun to hear their openings are realize that the themes are used as the openings to concertos (BWV 1052, 1053, 1048, 1059) and Masses. Speaking of Masses, BWV 232 is fair enough; the Kyrie is brilliant, and the Agnus Dei is a bit quick for my liking, but the soloist sings beautifully.<br />Ah, the Coffee Cantata, BWV 211, is a fun piece to listen to! A parody indeed.<br />So, that's all I can write for now. If anyone's interested, I've got a blog called Mitch's Pipes.<br />Thanks!
B007SSEBCU|2.0|I was eager to watch this movie.  It doesn't matter whether you're a fan of her politics or not.  This movie insults Margaret Thatcher.<br /><br />The majority of the movie is in the present and portrays Thatcher as a demented lonely forgotten old woman.  Her husband is dead and her son lives in Africa and doesn't speak to her.  The reason for her son's withdrawal?  She abandoned her family to pursue her political ambitions and satisfy her hunger for power.  Now there is no question that the families of politicians sacrifice much to support them.  But when have you ever seen a male politician shamed and belittled for the sacrifice of their families?  In one scene, Thatcher is driving off for her first day in Parliament.  As she drives off her children are chasing her down the driveway \\"don't leave us mommy!\\".  This aspect of the film is mostly troubling and completely misogynistic as it paints the picture that women who serve are selfish and power hungry while men are self sacrificing.<br /><br />It also paints Thatcher as stubborn, rude, and unwilling to listen to all sides.  She should be portrayed as someone who's dedication to her core principles remained unshaken throughout her life.  Because of this, she should be honored as one of the greatest leaders this world has known.
B0000560X0|5.0|I appreciate great musicianship.  Of course, that is exactly what George Benson, his band, guest pianist Joe Sample, the BBC Big Band, and the Ulster Orchestra provide on this DVD.  Both the visual quality and the sound quality are very good.  I particularly like the jazz pieces like \\"Breezin,\\" \\"Deeper Than You Think,\\" and his version of \\"Lately.\\"  The latter is quite beautiful!  I play that particular track a lot.  His singing of \\"In Your Eyes\\" is wonderful!  Real nice.  Lastly, his popular dance-type singles are a lot of fun.  The audience really gets into it.  One woman even comes up on stage and dances with George Benson.  I have one final thought about this DVD.  This DVD introduced me to Joe Sample.  I was so impressed by his talent that I purchased a CD of his music.  I highly recommend this DVD for a good time!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is on a level that is rarely seen in today's pop culture. Exceptional writing by Joss Whedon and Tim Minear, this show is the complete opposite of every other Scifi show ever done. No aliens, no socialist eutopian concepts that have answered all of man's problems. Same problems, same political, religous and social differences. We continue on as we are now in the future in this brilliant series. Just like old becomes new today, the frontier becomes realized in a new terra formed galaxy. Horses and spaceships, lasers and bullets are all part of the same story line. If you have not seen this show, it is a must see.
B002ZG997C|3.0|I watched this several times, so it is entertaining enough for me to watch it more than once..  after you watch this several times you see clearly that not all the pieces fit together very well.  There are certainly a few things about the movie that are very shocking, and many things that aren't very believable<br /><br />but if you are watching this so you can see Mila Kunis - who is just plain lovely in the movie - then you won't be dissapointed
1451608659|4.0|I was a huge fan of Moceanu in the 96 Olympics.  The mystery on what happened to her after those Olympics were never answered for me.  After reading this book, you will finally realize what a 14 year old girl had to endure and quite honestly suffer through to be on an Olympic team to compete for the greatest prize in the world.  If you love behind the scene looks at journey's of people who had to take the sacrifice to be number one in their sport, this is a great read.  Moceanu's training will relate to a lot of athletes before her and after her who may have dominating parents or coaches that demand perfection at all times.  How a 14 year old girl who had to deal with being shy and timid was able to keep going with all the torture she was put through is simply amazing.
B00008BLB8|5.0|In 1975 this band was one of the worlds hottest! They would collapse (drugs, arguments) soon afterward in 1977 only two years later. They would never rise to this level again and now have been on the oldies circuit for decades. But if they had kept to the path they were on they could have stayed at the top for many years after this one. On this one however we hear them tear it apart in a blistering concert filled with hits sung and played well. They do everything right here and at this point everyone assumed that they were gonna stay up in the stratosphere. They thought so too and this concert is a testament to that. Every song just rocks here and they were burning it down totally.
B0010OIN90|5.0|I got this Lego Racers Watch for my nephew, and he has thoroughly enjoyed tinkering with the parts of this watch.  I guess tinkering is the appropriate word since it has a lot of Lego structuring pieces.<br /><br />I was over at my nephew's house a few weeks ago and I thought I would let him show me all the tricks of working with this Lego watch.  He was more than happy to oblige.  The first thing he showed me was the box (I am surprised he kept it this long), but he pointed out that this watch was water resistant to 65 feet (that is 50 meters in typical watch jargon).  This was the summer and exclaimed to me that he could wear it in the pool.  He thought that was very cool - and it is cool.  He still had all the parts together, and in addition to the basic watch assembly, he showed me that the set had an additional 18 pieces that he could use to personalize the watch.  He particularly liked the piece that he could place over the watch face to give it a black \\"look,\\" however; he could not get that particular piece to snap on while I was at his house.  There were all kinds of other parts, including wheels (for what use, I cannot imagine).<br /><br />I asked him if I could fiddle with it for a few minutes, he said sure - but do not break it, or you will be sorry.  I started to remind him I bought it for him, but I thought that would be very small on my part.  Anyway, I could certainly tell I grew up in the pre-Lego generation, because I could not get anything to work. The only pieces I recognized, other than the watch, were 2 regular building blocks, for what purpose I do not know.  I finally yelled help, and he came to my rescue.  He showed me how everything works, but I do not think I could replicate any of the steps he had just taken.  I learned a lot that afternoon.<br /><br />I am glad I got this Lego watch for him - it is so hard to buy for kids his age, unless I buy an expensive electronic gadget, and that, I refuse to do; mainly because I cannot afford them.
B004H4XL7E|5.0|Fantastic book, great ideas and really makes you consider how you do things today and how you can improve for tomorrow.
B008EQIK90|4.0|We downloaded this movie on the spur of the moment to watch something with visiting relatives.  First time we have ever downloaded, and it was super easy to do.  The movie was very funny, high action and we all loved it.  HOWEVER, don't show it to preteens because it contains lots of R-rated language.
B000001ESN|5.0|rush was a big prog metal band (that had hit fm radio songs ) for the first 7 years of it's existance , then it became more accessible with this one. And it was able to do that and create music that was very ecclectic and thoughtful. This one had the two big radio songs 'free will' and 'spirit of the radio\\" on it as well. This was just a fine piece of song writing and singing. This wasn't a themed disc either. although their past work was masterfull this one really helped them gain even more fans.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A great story, about a people living in a silo buried in a silo  dug 150 levels to the ground.  It's also very good because the bad people are not portrayed stupidly, but one could almost understand where they are coming from.<br />There are a few illogical things, the toughest one is probably if the they pump the water out of  silo 17 wouldn't it suck poisonous air in?<br />Anyway a good read and there is always something.<br /><br />It makes one want to hear more from the story, like  connecting silo 17 with silo 18 etc.<br />M.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I was rebuilding a computer with an AMD Phenom II quad core and a stock cooler. The old cooler was not working as well as it used to, even with blowing the dust out. The sort of errors I was getting made me think the motherboard was failing, so I got a new model Asus board and the Cooler Master 212 Plus. Excellent price, by the way. Working with a new motherboard makes it easy to get to the installation stage.<br /><br />The worst part of installing this cooler is figuring out how. The printed instructions were worse than anything I've seen from IKEA. I could not figure out how to make this work. I looked through these revues and one from July 27, 2012 (thank you Anders Herzberg) mentioned Youtube videos. Look them up - it make the process ridiculously simple.<br /><br />Be aware that the cooler will likely block at least one Ram slot. This was not an issue for me, but if you're trying to fully populate the slots, this may not be the cooler for you. It is a tall design as well; the top of the cooler is about 6.5 inches from the motherboard.<br /><br />Temp-wise, I haven't measured the thing under stress, but it is quiet and when I was in BIOS the CPU temp was about 10 degrees above room temp.
B005NFJAMG|5.0|I always liked the movie.  Wanted the buray version which would be perfect for home viewing and that was exactly delivered, on time, no hassels.
B004VQFQ2Q|4.0|This is underrated as far as this band goes. Gillians vocals were jarring to me back in the day but later I gave this a chance and it's actually a well accomplished sabbath metal opus. Still it's a hard thing to do , follow dio! and I should have given this a better listen back then.
B0043EV774|5.0|I would let anyone who loves Johnny Depp know about this film; buying it for them as a present is even better. The Blue-Ray is extremely vivid and makes everything almost look \\"too real,\\" which is not a bad thing.

B000Z27HLS|3.0|When I saw the movie program on TV I was really excited to get the DVD. However, the producers, or the PBS station that aired it really cut out a lot from the aired program! Some of the cut footage are really important to the story! For example, the scene when Catherine and Mrs. Allen goes to the tea room, leaves the tea room, and then bumps into Mr. Tilney - that's sets up the story between Tilney and Catherine - but the tea room is completely gone! If you saw the TV program at the full one hour and thirty plus minutes you will be losing eight plus minutes from the DVD. At least I bought it from Amazon at a cheap price...
B004SKJTY6|5.0|I loved the movie, I found it to be both entertaining and intelligent, for once I agree with the Oscar's.
B00447G29S|1.0|I was excited to get this movie, as we had not seen it before. Opened it to enjoy with our new 3D setup, and was disappointed to find that it did not work with out setup. It looks like maybe you could use the red and blue (old 3D) glasses that came with it, but I can only see out of one eye, so that was never an option for me. I will try to return to Amazon, hopefully they will take it back :(<br /><br />On the plus side, I now know what to look for in the descriptions to make sure that I get \\"TRUE\\" 3D for my 3D-tv.  If it does not say \\"To watch this movie in Blu-ray 3D, you will need a 3D-capable television and active-shutter or passive-shutter glasses as well as a 3D-capable Blu-ray player. See 3D 101 for full details\\", then it is not going to work.
1439177783|5.0|I loved this book.  Incredibly well written, engaging and authentic.  I completely related to the author and her struggles with self esteem and body image, which led to her anorexia.  This is a book that will help a lot of people overcome their eating disorders, because while I related to her and her struggles completely, at the same time, watching objectively as the story unfolds it is SO clear that she absolutely was, ALWAYS, more than 'good enough', no matter her weight.  I hope that women around the world will cease to attach their self worth to a number on a scale or a size on an item of clothing.  This book helps to spread that positive message through Portia's painful experiences.  Excellent book, well worth the read.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Purchase was easily done, quickly done and showed up directly into my kindle. This book ( last book of the trilogy) is very good and answers all those question you may have and more.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|The first episode of this 4th season is so unsettling that I had to get up and walk out of the room.  This is the first time I had to do that since Dexter began.  There are few scenes so unsettling that I am unwilling to say, \\"It's just a movie,\\" but this one was too real for me.  I remember only one time being that un-nerved before and it was the first time I saw \\"Psycho\\" and felt I had witnessed a murder.  So get ready all you guts and gore fans, you will get your money's worth in episode # 1.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|This show moved me to the point that \\"regular\\" TV will no longer be the same.<br /><br />I \\"discovered\\" it online 2 weeks ago and streamed it 1/2 a season a day. I thought Terry O'Quinn deserved an Emmy, I checked and see he got one.<br /><br />I thought the leads a bore though... and after 4 years not even very likeable. I don't think they can act. Not the pretty ones. Kate, Jack and Sawyer... who cares! Locke was hypnotic. Benjamin Linus was played grandly and that actor won a well deserved Emmy. When Ben apologized to Locke in the finale... I cried. And when Locke forgave him... I had to pause the stream and re-group.<br /><br />For me Lost was all about the island and those who knew it not the self-involved Kate/Jack/Sawyer and later Juliet 4-some. The Ben/Locke/island relationship was what kept me hooked.<br /><br />Locke is the best Colonel Kurtz since Colonel Kurtz!!<br /><br />I give the finale a lot of slack but no matter how I think it I can't figure why Penny is \\"there.\\" It was a great journey though.

0345803485|1.0|Stephanie Meyers the author of the Twilight series should have a team of lawyers at the ready to sue Ms. James for plagarism!<br /><br />This novel (no scratch that, book) is a total rip off of Twilight with a soft porn twist!  Ana = Bella, young, bright girl unaware of her own appeal, Christian = Edward - mysterious, wealthy, handsome,  with a dark secret and sad background, Jose is Jacob - the long suffering other dude.  This book is bad in so many ways I don't even know where to start!<br /><br />The sex scenes are boring and appear to have been written back when Ms. James was in grade school.  The characters are uninteresting and their relationship (very similar to Twilight) is never really explained to the reader - it is highly unlikely these two would ever connect in the real world!  The story is tired (rich man meets young poor student and tries to change her -  can we say Pygmalion?) - pretty much everything about this book is stolen or rehashed from other authors.<br /><br />What is saddest of all is that due to the success of this poorly written and uninteresting book I have to believe that the collective american female fantasy is to be dominated by a psychologically damamged man who tells them what to wear, what to eat, when to sleep and does not even let himself be touched or looked at without his permission?  Give me a break!!<br /><br />I cannot explain the popularity of this book but if you still want to read it to see what all the fuss is about, I recommend you borrow one of the million plus copies floating around and spend your hard earned money on something else worthwhile!  Like The Kardashians - this piece of poorly written fluff seems to have tapped into our bored american psyches - embarassing stuff.<br /><br />I guess this is what happens when the Kardashian and Housewives of New Jersey set put down the remote and pick up a book!
0345803485|1.0|This book is a skidmark on the underpants of society. It is quite obvious to me the author of this book has no soul. This book is only for the most primitive minds

B008JH5CVS|5.0|You may not believe me, but this is the best movie I've seen since April.  It's not about the director or the caliber of the writing etc.  This is the only movie in a good long while (with the exception of Total Recall that just came out) that has been thoroughly entertaining.
1602834865|5.0|I like the reading of Jeremy Irons, certainly perfectly matched due to his own performance as its protagonist, Charles Ryder, in the BBC miniseries. A couple of decades after that role accelerated his breakthrough, he returns to the novel. He enters smoothly into a wide range of male and female, young and old, foreign and English characters. He responds with the same elegant wit and sensitive emotion which made his Random House audiobook of \\"Lolita\\" similarly praiseworthy. (I reviewed this too.)<br /><br />As for the book, does it hold up? I'd read it in college after I'd seen the series, and I found that Evelyn Waugh, as a Catholic convert, was still handling the shift in his own sensibility delicately. The coming of age of the younger members of the family Charles meets, and how they face the demands of maturity in morals, responsibilities, and economic demands in a changing society serves as the theme for what on the surface, and at first, feels a lighter comedy of manners. Gradually, the defense of the Church's teachings emerges, unsurprisingly and steadily, to counter in the hapless Marchmains the Oxford-London smart set with their own daring morals, or their lack, among the privileged class of post-WWI Britain, and as WWII arrives again. The framing device of Ryder's return to Brideshead, the title of the work, gives added depth in the cyclical brutality within the fate of the ancestral manse, symbolically and spiritually, and some of the last pages in this novel provide its most moving passages.<br /><br />Perhaps the reading betters the book. I admired Waugh's satire and it's enjoyable to hear of so many sent up so well. It does feel a long work even if \\"only\\" ten CDs narrate those interwar decades. Due to Irons' command of the material, he sustained my interest better than if it'd been a text to re-read. If you wonder how the book stands up after you'd seen the series, as many of us came to this novel in this way, I'd recommend the audiobook.
B007BVOF8E|4.0|Thie book is an old favorite of mine, having read it many times since college.  The movie captured the moody feeling of the book and I was very impressed with the portrayal of Smiley by Gary Oldman.  If you are not familiar with the book or a fan of LeCarre, then this is not for you.
030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn is an amazing writer. Her vivid details and twisted storyline keep the pages turning the minute you open the book. HIGHLY recommended mystery thriller. Read her other books: dark places and sharp objects. Keep writing Gillian you are AWESOME.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is challenging and hard to put down. If you fear addiction to games, this is one that should scare you silly.
0345803485|2.0|I don't know, is it a societal commentary that a poorly written book can become a multi-million best seller because it's sexually stimulating?  I had to simply skim through portions of this book, not because the sex embarrassed me, but because the bad writing didn't draw me in.  There's no character development to speak of.  If you pull out the porn and just analyze the rest of it, you'll fall asleep.  I gave it two stars because the porn parts were not as boring as the rest.

B001AH6ZWY|4.0|Science fiction? Yes. Generic science fiction? No.<br /><br />In this film adaptation (sort of), Carl Sagan imagines what first contact with an alien species would be like, given everything that was currently known about actual science and astronomy. Without giving too much away, the movie pulls it off magnificently, going through everything imaginable about the response to alien contact: decryption, mathematics, politics, military (US mostly) concern, religious fervor, some of the crazies, human brilliance and idiocy, and still manages to strike an emotional cord with the main characters. It doesn't attempt to guess what aliens would look like or their capability, leaving that unknown element as it should be: unknown.<br /><br />It's not all perfect, there's some lack of elegance in some of the writing and dialogue, and the ending in the court room could have been tightened up around Ellie's experience, but overall it's imaginatively written without assuming anything, and makes great points about how human reaction and the value of \\"non-practical\\" fields of science, given the interconnectedness of all the different sectors.<br /><br />Give it a look. Won't disappoint.
B008QE9VJI|4.0|love the cover art............can't wait to see this again........the only part i didn't really care for was the party scene......just thought it took away from the rest of the movie. everything else was just great, johnny depp super performance.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|A great App that keeps getting better with updates.<br />At first I thought it would be \\"neat\\" to be able to access my laptop from my kindle fire....but now I can control all five of my laptops/desktops from my Fire or my Galaxy SII, and even my \\"no longer used as a phone EVO\\"<br />I no longer have to check each one for backups etc or check defragging ot 9 TBs total data...i can do it via wifi ...sweet.<br />plus I can check in from the Internet through gmail.

B005ETA5K2|1.0|Everything is designed for Windows. I use a Mac Book Pro with OSX 10.8 (Mountain Lion) The software for Macs is limited significantly vs that offered to Windows users. The product did not increase my range at all. I also thought with such a high gain antennae that I would pick up more networks in my urban, congested area but did not pick up anything other than what my MacBook Pro picked up with it's built in wifi.  Checked the signal strength readings before and after installation of this product using IStumbler and this product did not increase signal strength .  All the instructions in the user manual are for Windows users only. No Mac instructions in the user manual. Latest driver supports only OSX 10.6  Very disappointed. Am going to attempt to return.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|Although many ardent fans of the 1960's soap opera did not like the 2012 film version of the series, \\"Dark Shadows\\" starring Johnny Depp really is a fun film. I believe that most purists of the daytime serial (including myself) were hoping for a script that was melodramatic in tone and stuck to what made the show a success in the first place: a piece of work that may have been hard to believe but took itself so seriously that one became lost in the characters and stories. Instead, Tim Burton's take on \\"Dark Shadows\\" is a comedic one with the bulk of the script dealing with Barnabas Collins being released from his coffin in 1972 and trying to adjust to a new time with strange people and events.<br /><br /> All of the original characters from the ABC series are present and Johnny Depp (an ardent fan of Barnabas and of the show) does his best with the material he is given, but as I was watching the film I couldn't help think that there will only be one true Barnabas and that is Jonathan Frid who sadly passed away a few weeks before the film's debut in theaters. Jonathan actually has a cameo in the movie (his last acting role as a guest at a party) along with others from the serial including the beautiful Lara Parker (Angelique), David Selby (Quentin Collins) and Katherine Leigh Scott (Maggie Evans/Josette DuPres).<br /><br /> The Blue Ray will feature 9 scenes cut from the theatrical release so that is something to look forward.<br /><br /> \\"Dark Shadows\\" was a hit upon its release in May, 2012 making $236,000,000 on a $150,000,000 budget so Warners was quite happy and it did bring renewed interest in the original series with MPI releasing a beautiful box set of all 1225 episodes along with a slew of bonus features in a coffin that quickly sold out.<br /><br /> On October 30th, 2012 the two original \\"Dark Shadows\\" films from 1970 and 1971 will be released separately on DVD and Blu Ray for the first time so look for those titles too.
1118109791|5.0|Most appreciable fact is that it was promised to have been delivered within 3 weeks: whereas I got the delivery in 4 days.<br /><br />The condition was superb and as good as new.<br /><br />Being a person paying attention to detail, the only minor damage on this supposedly new book was a small tear on the front cover about a cm.<br /><br />Verdict: Superb + Exceeds expectations.
B005LAIGQE|5.0|I ordered \\"Big Miracle\\" (BD combo Disc) and it was so fun to watch.  I remember the actual event and it was heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time.  It was nice to see it played out once again.  My whole family watched this with me.  This is a wonderful movie about three whales trapped in ice and their story of how they survived with the help of so many different people.<br />Drew Barrymore is truly amazing in this movie,she evokes so many different emotions from her audience. John Krasinski plays the role of the original journalist that discovered to Whales plight. He really believes that he is ambitious until he meets Kristen Bells Character. The beautiful, Kristen Bell does another great job of playing a Narcissistic journalist who seems to learn how to be a bit more human. Ted Danson is wonderful, as a greedy oil baron, who also has a heart.  He just needs a nudge from his wife,(Kathy Baker) every once in a while to remember that heart. Dermot Mulroney plays the surly National Guard Pilot very well.<br />This is a movie worth adding to your collection.

B002PNAY9C|5.0|I enjoyed all the books in this series. I saw the original movie first & knew that there must be a lot more to the story & there was.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great game....it reminds me of old school Mario brothers. I love playing it and so does my 3 yr old son.
B0086DBE62|1.0|I'm 37, so it could be that this was just not meant for my age range. My 7 yr old niece liked it. I was bored within minutes and found it brutal to sit through. Love Julia, but this was not a good role.
034580404X|5.0|WOW,WOW,WOW!!  Everything you have heard about this book is true.  Couldn't put it down.  Each book got alittle milder in content but still great. Even with all the erotic content, the story itself was quite good.  Don't usually read a book twice but this one I would.
0307582884|5.0|We picked up the Maze Runner audiobook before heading out on a long driving vacation. I needed something that my husband and teen son would like. Maze Runner was a great choice.<br /><br />The story - it starts with a bang and goes on from there. My son particularly liked that it didn't move too fast or have a deep, complicated plot. He constantly talked out loud at the story, \\"Wow, yuck, cool.\\" So much fun. My son is also a reluctant reader and as soon as this one ended he said, \\"I'm reading the next book in the series.\\" Great job Dashner and Dearkins!<br /><br />The reading by Mark Dearkins - I've listened to a fair share of audiobooks and this has taken the lead in best performance. He is an American but added touches of ethnic tones to a couple of the characters. Dearkins was able to give a distinctive voice to each character. I knew who was talking before he added the conversation tags. SO WELL DONE! His reading of the action was fantastic.<br /><br />If you want to hear a top notch narration - pick this one up.
B006MPKAOI|4.0|I really enjoyed this 1st time novel  from Elizabeth Haynes. It was at times creepy but I couldnt wait to pick it up and continue reading.  I wanted to know that  Catherine would survive this controlling person.  The writing was  such that I could vividly imagine what she was experiencing. I really recommend this a s a great read.
0345803485|5.0|I know I'm late to the party, but this book was phenominal...it was truly a page turner...It is definitely hot, but the plot itself just makes you want to continue reading, to find out what bizarre thing Christian is going to do next.  I have already order the next two books.. If I had known it was going to be this good I would have ordered the trilogy from the beginning.  I was so caught up I started reading the cheat book for the second book that amazon offers for a look inside the book before you order...hahaha....I needed to find out what was going to happen next....Great book....
B007QNRMUU|4.0|Easy to download and was able to burn it on a CD very easily! Great, love how convenient it was and love this CD!!
B003LXSY60|5.0|Really good album, but I do like El Camino better.  The combination of Brothers and El Camino is amazing.  I'd recommend getting both.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I don't quite understand all the negative reviews for this book. It is no \\"Hunger Games\\" or \\"Divigerent\\" or \\"Insurgent\\", but books like those are a rare find. That being said, this is a good series to read. Not excellent, but still a very good read and hard to put down. I finished each book within a couple of days. Crossed has more adventure than Matched did, and kept you on your toes. I look forward to reading the last book in the Series.
B00846TTDG|4.0|Good show.  Pay close attention or you can lose the focus. I liked the movie and would view it again just see what I missed the first time.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I've often thought of Blu-ray as a \\"last gasp\\" of the physical media world, having only adopted Blu-ray as a technology in my household over the last year.  With hundreds of DVDs already purchased over the years, the thought of re-purchasing anything I already own seemed ridiculous.  I've since purchased the movies that have most resonated with me over the years (read: geeky movies) on the new format, and while most of them have had some truly great audio and video transfers (Lord of the Rings comes to mind), most of what I've purchased is comprised of \\"newer\\" movies that haven't needed the love that the first two Alien movies needed in order to be relevant from a quality standpoint.<br /><br />Alien in particular has a truly stunning video transfer.  While there are a few moments that demonstrate that this is in fact a movie that was filmed 33 years ago, the crispness and detail in virtually every scene makes it feel like someone captured these moments yesterday.  Of particular note is the lens flare, the lighting/shadows throughout the ship, and the scenes with MUTH-R.  You will be forgiven if you think this is a modern movie in those scenes.<br /><br />Aliens also fairs quite well, although it would be a \\"9\\" to Alien's \\"10\\" as far as transfer quality.<br /><br />The audio is also quite well-preserved, although there are moments in both movies where the actual samples weren't cleaned up and have a strange, almost sound-stage-ish quality to them.  I say strange, of course, but they've always sounded that way; it is merely more evident that they were not re-mastered in the same way, much less re-recorded.  Certainly not a deal-breaker, but worth mentioning.<br /><br />I mentioned \\"a few moments\\" where the age of the movie shows, and it unfortunately is in the rather rough special effects in Alien.  I'm sure I'll be burned alive with Internet flames by saying this, but a piece of me wishes for a George-Lucas-level cleaning of those few moments (the Nostromo flying through space, the occasional HUD, and Bilb...er...Ash's \\"accident\\" to name the worst offenders).  I know that this wouldn't preserve the integrity of this classic film, but these moments have not aged well even without this superb HD re-release; seeing them in startlingly lifelike 1080p only makes them hurt more.  I don't think a CG dance number should be inserted, but these moments would be a world better if digitally retouched (not to mention make them feel a bit more at home against the recently-release-and-breathtakingly-amazing-to-watch Prometheus).<br /><br />The packaging is also nothing short of professional, and is almost a conversation piece in how well-realized it is.<br /><br />In summary, if you've loved these movies growing up, or you want to know why the hell the stuff in Prometheus is referenced, you should immediately pick this up.
0307744434|1.0|The concept sold me.  A circus only open at night, arriving with no announcements, with black and white striped tents... Picking it up - I was intrigued right off the bat.  It was dark, mysterious - my mind conjured up visions of something only Tim Burton could create.  I was 50 pages in and was SO excited - telling my friends \\"oh, I got a good one.\\"  But, then...it went on, and on, and on and on... going nowhere.  I wanted to love it, like I did when I started it, but it became a terrible chore.  I had 75(ish) pages left and thought about quitting.  I couldn't quit after the pages invested just HOPING for something to happen.  \\"A fierce competition\\" between two magicians?  I read a different book.  I wanted to throw the book at a wall when I was done.

0618526412|5.0|The writing in this book is wonderfully subtle. It's as though Carson McCullers spends the whole novel chopping quietly away at a grand old oak tree. You don't realize so much is happening in the small everyday acts of these characters until the end when the whole tree comes down, leaving everyone shocked and sad and hyper-aware of a vast emptiness left behind.<br /><br />The novel centers around John Singer, a deaf-mute who lives happily contented with his best friend, another deaf-mute, until the friend goes insane and must be institutionalized. Singer moves into a boarding house and becomes the receptacle for the dreams, thoughts, rants and loneliness of the rest of the main characters in the book including young Mick Kelly, the teenage girl whose family owns the boarding house, Dr. Copeland, the town's only black doctor, Biff Brannon, a restaurant owner, and Jake Blount, a drunk mad with his ideas about how society should work. They all talk and talk at Singer, sometimes to his bewilderment, but none of them listen to him. Then, when tragedy strikes, they are all shocked and surprised. Isn't that how life usually works, in too many sad and awful ways to mention?<br /><br />I enjoyed \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" for McCullers's well-observed scenes and the thought-provoking clarity with which she sees the predicament of each of her characters. The way she develops this languid world of the south, layer upon layer, with sights, sounds, smells and the overall feeling of impotent dreams and disappointed hopes is truly a marvel to behold. I shall remember always the many small gestures that I found so touching as to be heartbreaking: the way Singer would look earnestly into the face of his friend before they parted each day to go to work; Mick spray painting the names of her idols on the walls of a house and then lying up on the roof so she could make her plans; Dr. Copeland wanting so much to reach out to his family, but being tongue-tied as though he and they would forever speak a different language; Biff Brannon dotting his dead wife's perfume to his temples and absorbing the memories of when he had loved.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book with the hope that each person who reads it will come away pondering the state of their own \\"inside rooms,\\" and take care to tend and spend time in that cherished space.ld forever speak a different language; Biff Brannon dotting his dead wife's perfume to his temples and absorbing the memories of when he had loved.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book with the hope that each person who reads it will come away pondering the state of their own \\"inside rooms,\\" and take care to tend and spend time in that cherished space.

B0085776BG|4.0|The actors in \\"Red Tail\\" are phenomenal and, more importantly, this movie tells a story which has been ignored and left out of our history books.  These african-american pilots and airmen had to fight every step of the way to be part of WWII.  Their job was to protect the bombers from enemy fighter planes and in reality, they did an exceptional job, never leaving their bomber(s), protecting them every step of the way.  There was plenty of action and also a good story line in the characters.  Anyone would like this movie.
034580404X|5.0|Sexy...sultry...mind-blowing at times.  Characters are intoxicating.  Story of sex, love and romance.  How two people can fall in love and change each other.  Awesome read!!!  Read all 3 books in one week!
B00498XRPE|4.0|I had just seen the new \\"Prometheus\\" in the theater and wanted to review the original.  This movie is, of course, a classic and never lets the viewer down.  I rented this from Amazon's streaming service and was very happy with the picture quality on my HDTV via my PS3.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the youversion Bible app is fantastic as is the youversion website. Its a really conveniant app because it allowed me access and the ability to download complete bibles in a variety of translations and languages. the best part is that you have all the diffrent versions at ur fingertips.also I'm happy because I have in on my e-reader which weighs a lot less then my paper bible
B000002LFZ|5.0|The CD arrived earlier than promised, was packaged well, priced reasonably and is of good quality. I am a happy customer.
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|I was prepared to chuckle at this record, but gave it a try because I'm a Cyndi Lauper fan.  It looked like a good novelty CD to have around, and I expected there might be one or two good songs to put in the rotation.  I'm difficult to please because I love the blues, and have had this love for 40 years.  The very audacious idea that the record is named Memphis Blues seemed like the thing was going to be a real hoot.  Of all the nerve!<br /><br />And it is a hoot.  A hoot and a holler. Superb singing and playing.  This is a great record.  As usual, Cyndi shouts the songs with her usual huevos out attitude, and, as alway, seeming unaware of any limits to her choice of material.  I'd be willing to bet that if you played this record for your blues buddies, and you didn't tell them the name of the lead singer, they would flip out over it.  I was going to burn a copy for a pal who is a real blues snob, but I know he won't listen to a burned copy of a Cyndi Lauper CD.  He'd tell me he listened to it, but he wouldn't.  I do know he'll listen to a crisp, new CD, so I ordered a copy for him.  That's how much I like this record.<br /><br />A lot of times, these \\"duets\\" albums seem like they are good musical ideas.  Two good musicians together singing the same song - how can it go wrong?  As we all know, it usually goes wrong. This Lauper record is an exception to the mediocre duets album experience.  Everybody is great, and the pairings are very fine.  I especially feared that B. B. King wouldn't do too good.  I love the man and his music, but his age has not been kind to this blues god, but forget that - here, he does it right.  All of the other guests and the band are the tops, in my book.<br /><br />Girls, indeed, just want to have fun.  Either give Cyndi Lauper a chance in regards to an opinion on her records or get out of the way.
B007KDFWRG|4.0|It's great to see an album like this come out.  There aren't a whole lot of bands doing this kind of \\"jam\\" these days.  These guys can be really tight at times and really off at others.  Despite that, there's still some really good music on this cd.

B004HEXSLI|5.0|I remember reading about this book years ago but never carried through to buy it. It came back to mind after my Mother's recent stroke. I wanted some insight into what was happening inside her head and this was the answer. Though her stroke and my Mother's were not the same type, her experiences certainly cover the same territory. I found the understanding of Mom's situation that I was looking for and it is helping me everyday work with her on her journey back. Yes, it can be a little much on the right-brain side, but who am I to say anything having never experienced anything like a this. Her thoughts on some changes to the standard mode of rehab recovery certainly stuck a cord with me. I'd recommend this book to anyone wanting a link to understanding and anyone looking for an amazing read.
B008JH5FZ6|3.0|I was very disappointed in this movie. I waited a looonngg time to rent this as the reviews were great. I expected something similar to a Bruce Willis action movie...what I got was a very weak knock-off.  Hero does not smirk like Bruce or even come close(writing could have had something to do with that); heroine was OK nothing to write home about; sidekicks/bad guys/surprise ending all just OK.<br /><br />With all the effects and the plot line, this should have been a grab-you-by-the-pants type of movie....not so much!

B008CLI4N4|5.0|This is a well-made show. I am a big time movie and tv critic. I cannot stand holes in stories or bad acting. If it lacks one or the other I cannot watch. I loved this better then Lord of the Rings. I was worried about watching it thinking it would be hours of cheesiness. But I saw the ratings and thought to give it a shot. I am so glad I did. The setting is beautiful and the acting is fantastic. There are characters I really hate and really love. Which makes a great story when you can make your audience loath the bad person so bad you can't wait for them to fall out a window and get impaled by a rusty pole. This story can really make me mad which is exactly what it should do when you have a good story. It also makes you fall in love with a lot of the characters. I just love the youngest girl of the dire wolf clan. She is so darn cute. I love how she is a little rebel. And I love the dwarf too even though I am sure I will end up hating him later. He has really good lines though. There is a lot of sex (FYI for parents). Almost a bit vulgar and gross for my liking. They probably make it that way to keep it rated R. I am not into watching those kinds of scenes but the story itself was so good I had to keep watching. Amazing flick. I hope they keep the show going.

B00881VLCE|5.0|This app worked better than expected. I like that new free puzzle sets can be added. I also like being able to pick up where I left off if I am unable to complete a puzzle in one sitting. The one thing I cannot seem to figure out is how to remove puzzle sets. I have tried the &quot;remove&quot; option, however it will not actually be removed. If I could figure that out this app would be perfect. I am still going to give it 5 stars as the functionality of it for building puzzles and minimally intrusive adverts.
B008M34INW|1.0|I have to give this movie, Get the Gringo, produced and starring Mel Gibson, one star, and here's why:<br /><br />According to the 2000 Census, nearly 92% of Americans speak (and understand) ENGLISH.  In this movie, roughly 90% of the film  required English Subtitles, because the actors only spoke in Spanish, with the exception of Mel Gibson.<br /><br />In this movie, Spanish was the main language;  not only were the subtitles in white, making them extremely hard to read on the bottom of the screen  - but they were removed too quickly from the bottom of the screen.  That leaves the viewer wondering what was said.  It clips off your understanding about what is really going on in the movie.<br /><br />It is probably cheaper to hire a foreign actor, who knows no English - and because of this, it makes the production cost much less -  which leaves more profit for the company producing the film.<br /><br />Maybe that is why we are seeing more movies sold in the U.S., where subtitles in English have to be provided.<br /><br />In this case, the lack of consideration exhibited by  directors/ producers, in using Spanish-only speaking actors, then providing terrible english subtitles, in unreadable, white text on very light backgrounds, and removing them too quickly from the screen - has turned this family off on DVDs in general, and on Mel Gibson's films in particular.  It's back to the books for this family.<br /><br />I would not recommend buying this dvd.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I saw this book on a list of best sellers and also heard some comments made about it by acquaintances, so I decided to see for myself what the book was about. After reading a lot of classic literature, not only does this book seem lacking in writing style and vocabulary, its theme is permeated with dehumanization and brutality.  I made the decision to quit reading it. It is one thing to make a poor decision in a purchase and lose money; it is quite another to go a step further and pollute one's mind by reading filth.  I would compare it to mistakenly buying spoiled food and then, upon realizing it, eating it anyway.  Enough said.....this book is not for me.
140053271X|1.0|I bought my Nook before going abroad last October. Big mistake on my part - it started malfunctioning the day I opened it (touch screen didn't work and the on/off button stuck). My fault, I thought, I should have gotten it far enough in advance to test it out first. When I got back at the end of May, I called customer service to let them know about the problems, and they said I could send it in and get a free replacement. I sent it via UPS at the beginning of June. After not hearing anything for 3 weeks, I called to see if there was a problem. They said they had just received the Nook, which I find extremely unlikely since it's never taken UPS that long to deliver one of my packages. After waiting another 5 weeks without any sign of the Nook, I called them again this week to see what the deal was. I tell the customer service rep I sent the Nook in two months ago, and he acts surprised and says he'll see if he can find out what the problem is. He then calls someone in another department and informs me the Nook will be shipping out soon. No explanation whatsoever as to why the Nook has been sitting in their warehouse for 2 months. Basically, I've had this Nook for 10 months total and have never been able to use it, and they didn't even offer expedited shipping to make up for their mistake. Extremely unhappy with the service overall, and really regretting not getting a Kindle now. Buyer beware.

B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is a lot of fun, my kids even enjoy playing. If you like where's my water you'll probably like this one.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I got this cover 2 days earlier then the expected receiving date. I bought this for my Kindle 3 (Kindle Keyboard). Fit's perfect, looks great, I couldn't be happier. Definitely giving 5 stars for fast delivery and quality product. I was a little leery at first with the $40 price but it is definitely worth it. I will also be ordering another one for my Nexus 7 which I tried and it also fits.
B007OAAK0O|1.0|I thought this was the worst concert I have ever seen by Ross. The only reason there was so much hype was because she stayed during the storm so the crowd would leave peacefully and she came back the next day. Kudo's. Some of the songs seemed out of place, (\\"Maniac\\"?) and she's not much of a dancer as it appeared she threw in a quick class for this show. Other than her almost falling off the stage, not much to see here. If you want to see a \\"show\\" with Diana, look for Live at Caesar's Palace HBO special from around 1979. THAT was a show!
0307592731|4.0|First, this is an inspiring memoir. What a great testament to what a person can do if they set their minds to something that matters to them. Definitely made me want to hike portions of the PCT, especially as I live about 2 miles from it. Also made me rethink my little boo-hoos when I am just hiking a shorter hike.<br /><br />The author was brave, tough (the boot problem would have been enough to send me straight home), and pretty awesome. Her story was interesting, funny and pretty informative. I only gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because I expected more due to all the hype. Also because I was a little disappointed that she only hiked part of the trail - not that I could have done any better. I think I just expected this epic journey that stretched the whole trail.<br /><br />If you have read A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson, I think you might be a little disappointed with Wild, but it is still a good read and worth your time.
0765316994|4.0|John Scalzi's Redshirts is a novel that gives all the nameless redshirt ensigns from all the star fleets their due. No more will the junior officer redshirts die in vain on wacky away missions on dangerous planets! The book follows Andrew Dahl, a new Ensign redshirt assigned to the Intrepid, a flagship to the Universal Union. Andrew believes this is an amazing opportunity until he learns that all the redshirts die in horrible ways on away missions with the main members of the bridge, Captain Abernathy, Chief Science Officer Q'eeng, Lt. Kerensky, and Chief Engineer West. Ensign redshirts assigned to away missions are killed by ice sharks, sand worms, spear throwing robots, and other various cave monsters. Ensign Dahl and his other Redshirt Ensigns start to figure out what is going on and they do not like it one bit. The redshirts band together and concoct a brilliant plan to stay alive that any Star Trek fan would love. This book is a great parody of Star Trek with nods and fan service to many other sci fi epics. My only chief complaint is that this book is like the single player campaign to the Modern Warfare series. It is great but too short. Mr. Scalzi created great characters and could have had more misadventures with them throughout the book. Mr. Scalzi did tie up everything very well at the end and it was satisfying. I do hope for a sequel. I recommend this to any Trekkie or sci fi fan.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Calculator plus Kindle fire edition is excellent...it does all I need it to do &amp; I love the large keyboard.....I definitely recommend this app!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is good and a great time passer. The only thing I'm not happy about is when I got the update it deleted everything that's why I gave this 4 out of 5stars for $.
0765348276|5.0|John Scalzi has created a masterpiece with Old Man's War. John Perry has just turned seventy, and has enlisted in the Colonial Defense Forces, a military that protects human colonies throughout the universe from their vast amount of alien species that want them as lunch or worse. When John Perry arrives at the Colonial Defense Forces Station orbiting above Earth, his mind is transferred into a new, genetically enhanced body. A green super human if you will. The book is told from John Perry's perspective and like Johnny Rico before him, we follow him from boot camp, to the fleet, from battle to battle and then to Special Forces. Although similar to Starship Troopers, Old Man's War strikes out on its own and strikes gold. John Perry and his group of Old Farts are great and likeable characters and are peppered with Scalzi's wit in their activities and dialog. I really enjoyed this book and recommend this highly to sci/fi fans, fans of Robert Heinlein's books, or just readers in general. I look forward to reading the sequels.

1416511946|5.0|This books contains numerous painful revelations most folks would rather keep way in the back of a dark closet, and Nikki Sixx show incredible strength of character by laying these out, verbatim, for all to see in hopes of encouraging other addicts to keep fighting for sobriety.<br /><br />An unexpected element of this book is a vivid insight into the mind of a young man and how he truly views casual sexual encounters, even with beautiful women. I know he has matured greatly since those days and with age comes wisdom, but I think it would be invaluable for young women to read these passages and realize how little is gained by using sex in attempt to garner affection, or even have a guy remember your name. Sex and love are viewed as differently as night and day. Reading this book brought back several cringe-worthy recollections from my own youth - ouch!<br /><br />Moms read if first, then consider letting your daughters read it, the younger the better.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was a very good read. I loved the characters and personalities. I was never bored once while reading it... a good sign!
B00008EY65|5.0|I loved this movie when I first saw it many years ago, and I still love this movie. Yes, there are some mistakes in the movie, but that's okay. You're not watching it to critique it, you're watching it to be entertained! It's an overall wonderful movie with really good CGI, and a wonderful plot. I'm going to buy the sequel soon (which I also loved).
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app on my kindle fire!  It's big, bright and easy to use! Haven't found anything wrong with it!

B001A5W8YA|3.0|Good story.  Not the best Bond I've read so far, but enjoyable escapist fare.  I was surprised at how close the movie stuck to the plot...with one important difference.  In the book, Honey Ryder is only about 15 or 16 years old.  Bond agonizes over that issue right until the end and then, well James will be James.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I drive truck and when I do a pre-trip at 2am I just use my EVO. there's no need for a bulky flashlight. this app is all I need. its very convenient and very bright.
B004AUGJS8|3.0|This movie angered me a little, saddened me a little, and even scared me a little, but I was interested until the end. I need closure and I have my suspicions, but I recommend for fans of stories based on real-life instances.

B0001ADB8C|4.0|PROS:<br />-Great box art and box, wouldn't trade it for the world<br />-CD's sound great, well mastered<br />-The book and DVD is really only for the fans, but provide great insight into the all too short solo carer of George Harrison<br />-The booklets inside the great jewel cases are well done<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Worthless SACD of George's 'Live In Japan' CD, unless you own an SACD player.<br /><br />VERDICT:<br />Unless you are a true fan, I'd miss these and go and grab \\"All Things Must Pass\\", George's first, and best solo album, it is far better than the 'Big Brass' 70's sound on these albums.<br />That said, I personally am very happy with the box set. It was well priced and well done, and arrived on time (THANKS AMAZON :D)
B004T4KQJS|3.0|I felt a hard attempt to demonstrate the non existence of God rather than the attempt to make a purely scientific point.<br /><br />I am disappointed the author tries to leave clear that people who believes in God existence is just happy to hold to that faith and do not seek the unveiling of nature.<br /><br />What I believe is not important, but I find extrange that nowadays someone would write a  book to pursue a second agenda, and specially a science book that would be about fact sand not about the implication of those facts on over people´s beliefs system.
B0009MAP90|5.0|I have only just started to listen to complete Bob Dylan albums, and if his first album 'Bob Dylan' is anything to go by, I'm excited for whats around the corner. Here, we see the beginnings of Dylan and his music, with wonderfully charged covers of folk songs and original compositions. This includes a beautiful tribute to Woody Guthrie in 'Song to Woody' and the raucously loud 'Highway 51'. At only 39 minutes long, is isn't an exceptionally long album, but it sure is worth it. if anything, buy it for the cover of 'House of the Rising Sun'.
0385344228|4.0|Good book and I like all the characters.  Seemed to drag on a bit and I think could have gotten to the point sooner.  It is a page turner at times and would recommend this book with the caveat that it does have place that could be skipped over.  Funny how people/friends can be just when you need them the most.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|what a joke on the reading public. I downloaded this by mistake when browsing and decided to try to get through it. execrably written trash, with no redeeming story line, characters, or value. worst thing I've read in years; waste of time and money.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I received my ebook really quickly.  The book itself is a quick read, very entertaining and keeps you turning the pages to find out what comes next.  I would recommend this book for adults (specifically women) who want an escape from their everyday life situations.
B006LSZECO|5.0|couldn't put it down. THis book will keep you guessing from early on, but you will probably guess WRONG!The character studies are well done, the back and forth chapters a perfect technique here, and the plot twists and turns are so tight that you won't want the book to end--I didn't! A great read.
B008RC72G8|5.0|I saw this movie with my friend,and we had a blast. It was a hilarious good time. After seeing the movie, it made me start watching the original series. I love how this was mostly a comedy, and a tribute to the series, rather then a serious dramatic soap opera. Johnny Depp was great as Barnabas Collins, the vampire of Collinwood Manor. I love how it had a classic 'fish-out-of-water' story. It was like taking Bela Lugosi's Dracula and putting him in the 70's hippie age. This is definitely a Tim Burton film because everyone wears pale Marilyn Manson-type makeup, and it has Helena Bonham Carter, along with Danny Elfman music. Chloe Moretz gives a great performance as Carolyn Stoddard. She's the rebellious teenager we've seen in all of Burton's other films like Ryder in Beetlejuice.<br /><br />In the 1700's, Barnabas makes the mistake of breaking the heart of a witch named Angelique. She curses him by turning him into a vampire and locks him in a coffin for 200 years. In 1972, the Collins family are trying to find a governess for young David who claims to see the ghost of his mom. Along comes Maggie, who changes her name to Victoria Winters. When Barnabas is found and awakened, he returns home to bring the manor to its former glory and re'vamp' the family business. When Angelique returns and threatens his family, Barnabas must take action and seek revenge on the witch who cursed him. If you want a smart Gothic fun hilarious vampire movie that pays tribute to the 70's era and the original series, I would definitely recommend DARK SHADOWS!!!
0425263908|1.0|If you've read 50 shades, then you've read Bared To You. However Bared To You is a shorter version of the more in depth 50 Shades. In Bared to you there are just the 2 messed up lovers and there isn't much more to the story than that. In 50 Shades there are subplots happening along with the love story. 50 Shades is a much better story, Bared To You doesn't use the same 15 words and phrases over and over.  It'll be too soon if I ever see the word Mercurial written again.  Thesaurus E.L! They sell them everywhere.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I found this very User friendly Great way to take your Bible with you every where you go. Use it daily
0345803485|1.0|Worst book written in life, if you want fan fiction go to websites. But don't buy into this fake terrible atrocious piece of crap. The writing is horrible, a dog writes better. Can not believe I wasted my money on this. There is nothing feminine as talk,show hosts say about this book. Ana is a college school girl seeking who knows what that is stupidly tantalized by this man-made god that is rich but doesnt actually seem to work just oversees everyone. The writing... Again, horrible... And unrealistic. Waste of money, time, and effort.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|This book made me remember some of the great games of my childhood.  If you remember putting your coin in that arcade game and seeing the words \\"Ready Player One\\" then you will probably enjoy this book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was the third book of the series and I really enjoyed it. Actually I enjoyed all three books and I think this book was a interesting and fun ending to a very entertaining series. I do wish there was more, kind of sad to see it end.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was an extremely well written book!  I will be purchasing this other books too.  I suggest anyone who likes sci-fi to read this book.
B008COD5OO|1.0|I was very surprised how unrealistic and stupid this movie was.  There was nothing funny about the movie.  A teenager some how throws a party gets a bunch of drugs and does not buy any alcohol but somehow there is a boat load of it at the party along with kegs of beer?  Do not spend the money on this movie.  Superbad and American Pie were much better.
0553386794|5.0|I don't really need to review this book and series, the amount of reviews pretty much say it all.  I'll sum my opinion up in one word.  Captivating.  Don't go by my opinion, Read for yourself!
B005HSL626|5.0|I love it! if ur one of those people who like to beat there own high score this is a good game for u but if the kinds person who gets bord with the same thing nt ur game
B004HV54TU|5.0|I have been a Microsoft mouse user, various iterations, for 20 years. I finally got fed up with the aggravation of their wireless mouse and keyboard and decided to go wired. I tried a few other products including Microsoft, Logitech and even the Hippus Handshoe. Finally I tried the Evoluent VerticalMouse 4 in size medium. It was an instant \\"fit\\". My hand sits on the device comfortably and naturally. I give absolutely no thought to positioning my hand, that's how easy it has been to adapt to this device. I like it so much that I order the same mouse in size small for my wife. She too became an instant convert.<br /><br />The mouse arrived well packaged within its box. Included was the mini-CD with drivers and installation directions though I found that Windows 7 32Bit Ultimate recognized the device immediately and it functioned correctly.<br /><br />The unit is well made. The forward and back buttons are so simply and logically arranged that it's irritating, almost, that no one else thought of this. While resting your hand on the mouse your pinky finger will settle, naturally, on a bottom curved lip of the device. This positioning places the ring finger on your right hand perfectly for the button that enables copy, paste, undo, etc. BRILLIANT!<br /><br />As usual, Amazon's service and delivery was flawless.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Fun way to pass the time. Sure its a port of WMW, but its hella awesome! Love that the other characters chime in from time to time.
0691152640|5.0|Rogoff and Reinhardt do a comnplete job in assembling the history of modern governments and how they always fail to treat economics as an emperical science instead of an etherial religion. You cannot spend what you do not have, PERIOD!  Most of the legislators in Washington should be tried in court as traitors.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This app is great for basic photo editing on my Fire. No quirks, gallery works fine. Exactly what I wanted.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|After taking a break from Megadeth for some time now, I now gave their eleventh studio album. United Abominations was a reminder of why I love this band. Even if the songs deal with politics and such, the definitive sounds of thrash are such an exhilarating experience. With this album, Dave Mustaine has mustered a brand new lineup. You might expect it to sound different (like how Risk sounded different), but it's almost straight-up old-school. It's the classic Megadeth sound from the early years, with an added modern touch. Songs like \\"Sleepwalker,\\" \\"Washington is Next!\\" and \\"Gears of War\\" are sure to win the hearts of longtime Megadeth fans. The new version of \\"A Tout Le Monde\\" with Christina Scabbia is outstanding, though I still prefer the original. The only problem I have with this album is that it tends to sound slightly repetitive as we get to the last few songs. But overall, this is still a great album.<br /><br />Grade: 8.9 out of 10<br /><br />Also from Megadeth<br />So Far, So Good...So What! (8.1 out of 10)<br />Rust in Peace (9.3 out of 10)<br />Countdown to Extinction (9.4 out of 10)<br />Youthanasia (9.9 out of 10)<br />Cryptic Writings (9.4 out of 10)<br />Risk (8.2 out of 10)<br />The World Needs a Hero (8.9 out of 10)<br />The System has Failed (8.2 out of 10)
B002BWP49M|2.0|I was really disappointed in this latest edition to this series.  It was just a so, so movie and at times actually seemed kind of boring.  I have all the previous movies and liked each one of them, but this one is bad.  Because of this movie, I don't think that I would waste my money to purchase the next part when it comes out.  Save yourself some money on this and don't buy.  I highly DO NOT recommend this one.
B007STXHTM|4.0|Before purchasing the GoPro Dive Housing I was doing a lot of underwater video with my GoPro Hero2 using the [[ASIN:B003172FFW stock housing]]. Both video and images using the Dive Housing are night and day underwater. This fixes the blurry underwater images and video you get when using the stock housing. I have not noticed any vignetting in any of the shooting modes (wide, medium, narrow). I took off one star because the housing does make the screen a little difficult to see but this is minor. If you are shooting a lot of underwater video this is a must have.
B005LAII1C|1.0|I heard recently that this was a great movie, but I didn't like it.  In fact, there were very few funny comedic lines.  A teddy bear with a bong bangs a check out girl.  I hardly laughed at all, nor did the other audience members.<br /><br />Frankly, I was concerned for our culture.  I left before the movie was over.  I just decided there were better things to do with my life.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I was really enjoying this book, the character development and the plot turns, a good whodunnit. But the last few pages completely put me off. I won't be buying this for gifts as I'd imagined. Can't believe the editor let this go out as published.
B004EPYZSU|2.0|Two great stars in/past their prime, how do they or their agents/advisors let this happen? Couldn't they break Craigs ankle or double check the insurance and hire a torch? You will be amazed at how absurdly ridiculous the characters and the dialogue are. I mean there must have been competition amongst the writers once they saw this turkey was beyond hope.<br /><br />You are faced with choosing amongst so-so reviews or all out negative like this. I am tempted to say anyone writing a positive review on this movie is a paid flack, a shill, but maybe it is just irrationaly loyal Ford fans. Check the histories of the positive reviews before you buy. I gave it a star for the title, I probably bought for the title as I don't usually buy star movies with such lukewarm (at best) prof reviews.
0743201140|1.0|the code packet came intact however the code does not work. And I'm sure that I put it in correctly.<br />I guess it's probably the publisher's fault rather than amazon's. If their code generator has been cracked, then it's a huge problem.
B005LAII3U|3.0|Total Recall from 1990 was cheesy action done right. It took place mostly on Mars, had lots of bad lines (which makes them classic when said by Arnold), a huge and gory body count, mutants, a three breasted hooker and it had enough smarts to keep you guessing until the end.<br /><br />This 2012 version stays on this planet, has some good action, decent CGI and not a whole lot else worth remembering. Oh, it does have a brief shot of a three breasted chick, but that was done over two decades ago. Well, Kate Beckinsale looked good as the \\"wife\\" turned villain (the most memorable role in the film) and Jessica Biel looked yummy too, but that's to be expected. Colin Farrell doesn't do a bad job replacing Arnold, but he doesn't add a whole lot either.<br /><br />Worth a rental if you want mindless wall to wall action. You'll probably like it more if you have never seen the original.
B0087DFIOU|5.0|This is the one we've been waiting for.  Some reviewers said not his best.  Of course not, what did you expect?  Another Brave Heart or Year of Living Dangerously?  This is still an action-packed, tight, violent drama and should satisfy even the most critical Gibson fan.  My only complaint is what you see him do with a can of lighter fluid - it simply would not work. That aside, Mel ends up in a Mexican prison and realizes that to survive he has to kick-ass and chew bubble gum. Unfortunately for the bad guys he is all out of bubblegum!
B006UREQ3Y|5.0|This will go down as my top 5 all time favorites. The music is \\"EXCELLENT\\"! This is SLASH at his best and Myles Kennedy is second to none. I'm a 70's/80's rock music lover and have about anything you could think of. For the last fifteen years most of the music I've bought is \\"Live\\" be it CD/DVD so this was a welcome new comer to my collection. It's starting to get tough to find what I call good ROCK. This DVD is the one to have. After all, who needs an Axl when you have the Wheel #Myles Kennedy#................Truly awesome!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I enjoy this DVD very much. I can get through this one without feeling like I'm killing myself but still feel as though I've had a good workout.  I workout with this DVD between my workout with her other DVD \\"Killer Buns\\" because I get a little break. I like working out for 20 minutes and still feel as though I've done something effective. You get to choose how hard you want it too with 3 progressive workouts. My only complaint is that the DVD doesn't allow me to skip past her introduction at the beginning.  So I have to go and do something for a few minutes until I can click on the workout menu.  I'm happy to say that I can skip forward on the Killer Buns workout.

B006LSZECO|5.0|At first I could not grasp what was going on in this book!  Back and forth between two characters was confusing..AT FIRST...then I got so enthrawled that I could not put the book down, wondering whats happening now...it was such a great book.  I love psychological thrillers and this book was just that...I wish the ending was a little different, not sure in whaich way, but just different, like more solid..but a great READ!!

B00845PRDS|4.0|The Navy Seals are highly trained and put themselves in harms way taking care of problems so we can live in freedom without fear.  Critics seem to think the movie is a recruiting film, and perhaps it is.  However, those critics wake up every morning with the ability to critique because the Navy Seals have made our country safer.  Could the acting be better?  Perhaps, but most people don't know what the Navy Seals do or what they encounter in their lives.  This movie does a good job of depicting their mission and lives.
0670022411|5.0|Admittingly, this may not be a book for the impatient. However, if you enjoy investing yourself and your imagination into characters and changing settings, its impossible to put down.<br /><br />To say that it drags on isn't fair, nor is it fair to compare it with Harry Potter or Twilight. I am speaking as a fellow Hogwarts hopeful. The elements in this book are as an fantasy but its story is all its own. Ofcourse, there will be an \\" evil\\", a love story, and all other things that  fiction contains.<br /><br />Can anyone tell me if the charcter in the story showed us something? Twilight merely demonstrated how important it is to have a boyfriend and be codependant. Not the with this novel. It may in fact be similar in regards to Harry Potter due to our hero or heroine is somewhat of a chosen one.. she like Harry personifies bravery, courage, and inner strength. Only on that premise can I see similarities.. its own magical tale.. one in which I am glad to have read. I am soon to begin the second novel and very hopeful to enjoy it as well.

1439190275|5.0|As more and more research gets done on dieting, SINCERE research, not that of the government and disingenuous<br />animal rights activists it becomes clear that low-carb dieting is not really dieting but should be everybody's healthy lifestyle if they want to keep blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, and obesity in check.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Time well spent...my constant thought while reading this delightful picture of Ireland with it's charming characters with all their dreams and flaws as its centerpiece.  The author certainly has an ear for the homey dialogue and the hidden sorrows of her people.<br />There is such a nice mix of humor and sadness throughout the book...and always an underlying hope for a happier future.<br />I will be sure to recommend this book to my monthly Book Club and to anyone who just wants a \\"good read.\\"

B000M2O6AQ|3.0|I begin by asking your forgiveness should my insights of this movie offend; that truly is not my intention.<br /><br />Reading other reviews one gets the impression a recent and great archaeological discovery has revealed an old prophecy.  In truth this just another inspirational work of fiction, embraced by most who wrote here as factual; their bible if you will.<br /><br />I too found it an inspirational story, one of a many such stories that speak of hope for a better society.  A society where we all escape our own self interest and live in peace and harmony -- heaven on Earth. With different words and settings, it conveys the wisdom contained within \\"Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure,\\" 1989 -- \\"Be excellent to each other.\\"<br /><br />The story line, however, is not new.  Rather it is just the newest portrayal of a millenniums old truth passed down by many iconic people throughout human history.  In many ways it brought back to me memories of the sixties; no small feat I assure you.<br /><br />In keeping with this movie, I would also recommend \\"Stigmata,\\" 1999, from which comes a truth I learned as a young teenager, many decades ago now.  \\"Split a piece of wood, and I am there. Lift up the stone, and you will find me there.\\"<br /><br />However my very favorite and most precious wisdom is \\"Love one another as I have loved you.\\"  This latter sums up the message of this movie best.<br /><br />We keep coming full circle, some day we shall all escape the Wheel.<br /><br />God Bless,

B0073XV2W2|2.0|Daemon and Freedom were great.  This book takes an anti-military turn and I kept waiting for the annoying protagonist to die.  She adds no value to the plot for the entire book.  Would have been so much better without her and focusing on one of the other characters.  Starts off great, then good, then becomes almost unbearably boring, annoying, and unimaginative.  Becomes a love story with a horribly predictable ending.  Sets itself up for a sequel, which I hope never happens (I will not read).  Would rather have Suarez get back to his roots.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This is a must read!  The characters are very well developed.  I loved them all!  They will make you laugh, they will make you cry and just when you think you've got it figured out the rug gets pulled out from underneath you.  This is one of my favorite books.  It's one of those books that you can't put down and will be sad to finish.  Be prepared to be Slammed ;)
0345803485|1.0|I find it amazing that a control freak who is also a stalker and a pervert could be anyone's dream man, but apparently it's possible. The author made Christian Grey likable by making him truly sincere, decent, and loving. He is also a self-made billionaire at 27 and a complete sex-expert. He speaks fluent French and plays the piano like a pro. Oh, and obviously he is a brilliant Harvard drop-out. Clearly, Christian is the hottest emotional mess with mommy issues the author could possibly come up with. In real life, though, people like him are also self-absorbed narcissists and ruthless sociopaths, so what women should do when they come across somebody like him is run as far away from him as they can. There's some obsession in our society with dysfunctional personalities, which I do not seem to share. I heard that in the second book they have a vanilla relationship, so maybe the second book is worth reading more than the first one.
B005XN0SGU|5.0|After having issues with Comicat not finding some files, I decided to give Perfect Viewed a try. Not only did it find all my files but it gives more options as to how you organize them. Reading is better too, all view options are right on the screen without having to access a settings menu.<br />If you like reading your comics on Kindle Fire, Perfect Viewer is a MUST HAVE.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|need an easier way to get acorns could we buy them like we do animals and decorations.  like that if I miss playing a day or two that my animals don't die.  need more items that you can buy with coins and less objectives about how many friends or hearts that you have.
1451627297|5.0|I started reading Stephen King about the time I learned to read (not really but it seems like that long ago)The first books I really enjoyed The Stand being my all time favorite.The last few books were kind of crazier than the early ones and I quit reading them until a friend suggested 11/22/63.I read 800 plus pages in less than a week and enjoyed every page.I have never been a big fan of time travel and mostly read James Patterson or Nicholas Sparks type of books.But if Stephen Kings books are like this one I am back to being a fan!!

0553801473|2.0|Dazed... uncertain... SER GEORGE stumbled through the wilderness.<br /><br />His plans were as ruined as LORD TYWIN'S groin. All the sellswords he'd hired had capriciously abandoned him to pursue their own deviant agendas.<br /><br />THE OTHERS, for instance, were supposed to be the Primary Villains of the series. Unfortunately, they weren't very villainous; instead, they proved to be borderline retarded. In eight thousand years, not one of them had realized they could build boats, sail around the Wall, and thus transform it into a Westerosian Maginot Line. Instead, they hung out in the Haunted Forest and said \\"Boo\\" every so often.<br /><br />JON SNOW could no longer remember why he was in the book or what he was supposed to do. Each time a decision was required of him, as Lord Commander of the Watch, he did the least responsible, most goofy thing he, or anyone, could imagine. Somebody was apparently sneaking funky stuff into JON's ranger brownies.<br /><br />DANY TARGARYEN was even more forgetful. She could not remember where Westeros was or what she had ever wanted to do with it.  Instead, she became a slutty bureaucrat, possibly because that's the kind of character fantasy readers invariably love the most.  SER GEORGE was very annoyed with DANY and totally wanted his money back.<br /><br />TYRION LANNISTER was still funny but showing signs of Other-like retardation. Someone had told him \\"You should hide in a wine keg and be transported to the Free Cities, but you don't need to know which one, nor do you need to have any money or friends when you get there.\\" And TYRION -- quite unlike himself -- had said \\"Brilliant! This is the best possible plan! Sign me up.\\"<br /><br />BRAN STARK had the only subplot in which Things Were Happening! Therefore, SER GEORGE, who had no idea what to do with interesting subplots, abandoned it halfway through the book.<br /><br />THE OTHER STARK KIDS (including JON SNOW) were all of a sudden transformed into skinchangers, who could notonly link mentally with their own direwolves in dreams, but also other animals, including, presumably, human beings. They had just never noticed that, or gotten around to it before... somehow.<br /><br />CERSEI LANNISTER was bald. This might have been interesting, but DANY had beaten her to the punch and gotten bald first. (At one point, SER GEORGE considered naming the book A BALDNESS OF QUEENS.)  DANY going bald also meant that she couldn't tug on her braid.<br /><br />QUAITHE flat-out sucked. Given twenty seconds to answer questions, she didn't even try to warn DANY of the most daunting threat imaginable... that readers were getting bored.<br /><br />EVERYONE INVOLVED WITH WINTERFELL was grumpy. Snow fell; they were cold and hungry. Whatever.<br /><br />THE DRAGONS were getting big and fat and dragon-y, but despite the book title, nobody was doing anything with them, so there really wasn't much point in their being in the story. This upset their tummies.<br /><br />Even THE PLOT, once Ser George's most trusted comrade, had vanished into the fog, seemingly never to return.<br /><br />What was SER GEORGE to do?
B006M7JCC2|5.0|The ebook was wonderful and I I encourage everyone to read the account of her life journey into coma and her return.<br />It was a riveting book but easy read with a special chapter on Q &A and her view of cancer--its impact and how it changed her and the new vision she had after her return from death.<br />I would recommend it to caretakers, friends, and people with this dis-ease.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|addicitng. crazy addictive. I downloaded it looking for something to do before bed and didn't stop playing until midnight! love this!
B006LSZECO|3.0|The first half of the book reminded me of a fun beach novel. It was a fast read and an entertaining story (although a couple of times I found myself thinking that the book followed the Scott Peterson case a bit closely). And then we get to Part II, where the story becomes implausible but still it drew me in. And then we get to the last third of the book, where the story was almost impossible to believe would ever happen (but also wasn't entertaining).<br /><br />The writing is very accessible, and it's a fast read. It was made for summertime vacations. It did not live up to the reviews I read before purchasing.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Yes the update does wipe out all your scores. Not all updates do this but when you see the message saying you have to uninstall the existing version its going to delete the score database.<br /><br />So get Angry Birds Backup from the Play Store. It's free and it backs up Angry Birds, Seasons, Rio and Space. Use it every time before you update, or replace or wipe your phone. I've done this for months and it works great.<br /><br />If you can't use the Play Store try to Google the apk for it.

B000066C6F|1.0|I was rather excited when I found this 80's trash classic on DVD.. Unfortunately it's in the horrid & worthless pan & scan format.... You know, had this been a 1.85:1 film & it was \\"full Screen\\", I could have worked with that and adjusted my HDTV to make it 1.85:1, but this is not the case with this film & most of the DVD's that Sony now releases in the 1.33 ratio... I don't think this film ever had a widescreen version on DVD, which is disappointing.<br /><br />The fact that any company, this late in the home entertainment game, would release a 2.35:1 film in a lousy 1:33 ratio is not only insulting and reckless, it shows incompetent individuals are making key decisions at the studios and they deserve to lose money.. This is yet another DVD from Sony which is worthless, and anyone who cares about movies, and this film, should avoid this version.Ray can claim their hardware #'s is because of Sony forcing the drives into laptops and PS3's & claiming EVERYONE wants and has a Blu Ray Player...Very Sad..And all the propaganda hasn't done anything to help this dog of a format - it's still a joke after all these years.<br /><br />SO, enough of the games Sony, stop releasing P&S versions of your 2.35:1 & higher films, it does nothing but make you look like the incompetent fools that you are..

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read all three books this summer. It is not a novel that is a master piece. It is just a fun easy to read book. The sex was repetive. There are probably individuals who have a kinky life style.<br /><br />Other than the weak plot it was a love story. A young woman came into Christians life and changed him for the better. She taught him love.<br /><br />Read it for yourself and decide.
B007ZTLLMK|3.0|this game is really fun, but it uses A LOT of battery<br /><br />READ THIS IF YOU HAVE A KINDLE FIRE:<br />if you start playing this game on your Kindle fire, the device will get really hot if you play it for more than 1/2 an hour.

B008C20TDG|5.0|This book does a great job of personalizing the Paleo diet experience.  Most of the recipes in the book are taken from another super book called Well Fed by Melissa Joulwan.  I joyfully endorse both of these books.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best and most used app I own.  The plans have reminders and progress indicators. The bible is very quick and easy to navigate.  There are many translations available.  Also, there are smart links on text to footnotes or Greek/Hebrew definitions.  All this for FREE!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Delivery was fast and nicely wrapped for shipping. The condition of the book was excellent. I was very pleased with this order.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps on my kindle fire. It gives me how much battery I have left with one tap to my notifications and also has voice alerted for how much battery life I have left. So far I haven't found anything wrong with this app and am completely satisfied with how well it works.

B0016OLC5Q|2.0|I happened across this film while searching for something to watch on a Saturday evening.  The trailer looked interesting.  What I saw in the trailer matched what I saw in all but the end of the film.  In order to not spoil it for those who haven't seen this film or who haven't read any reviews that give away the ending, my comments center on only one thing.  With all of the lead character's experiences of living on the road, his ability to survive in the wild for several weeks, and his apparent intelligence, why would he look at a swollen, fast-moving river in his path back to civilization as an impassable obstacle?  Did the writer(s) of the screenplay leave out some important things from this movie about the end of the story?  If not, then this one issue caused me to feel like I wasted 2-1/2 hours.<br /><br />With so many 5-star reviews, it's apparent that many people liked this film.  My only advice is to be prepared for disappointment.
B008JOK59K|5.0|ORIGINAL REVIEW: I've liked Gaslight Anthem since shortly after &#34;Sink Or Swim&#34; was released.  Every album up to &#34;American Slang&#34; were dominated by absolutely beautiful songs, mixed with a few &#34;alright&#34; songs here and there<br />However, on &#34;Handwritten&#34;, the album starts off beautiful with &#34;45&#34;, and then drops to a line of &#34;alright&#34;.  ...and then it never gets back off of that line.<br />There aren't any bad songs here, but comparing anything on &#34;Handwritten&#34; to anything on their previous releases, nothing on this compares.<br /><br />UPDATE: In the years since I wrote the original review, I've really, REALLY come around to Handwritten.  I absolutely adore every single song now.  Classic album from The Gaslight Anthem.
B008MEM24S|5.0|it is down loading.... I cant wait for it to be done down loading. I'm bored.p.s I LIKE TRAINZZ. Yay its done downloading
0862047846|5.0|What more can be said about this book/story.  It is absolutely fabulous.  There are multiple plots within one book.  The author sets you up for his books to follow.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|verrryyy addictice I would highly recommend this game. it might crash every now and then but not constant. so go ahead download this game people
B00846REIS|2.0|This book is nothing more than a 'copy cat' version of the Fifty Shades series.  It's East coast vs West coast.  Players are still a 22 year old young girl vs 28 year  old mega rich guy.  Their issues are slightly different but the book is boring after reading the Fifty Shades series of books.
B003UYUP58|5.0|This history of cancer is one of the most gripping stories I have ever read. Really a page-turner. Clear insights, personal views, broad approach, it's all there. Highly recommended !
B008MEM24S|5.0|Fun and I love how they give you a mini story or line. I would recommend this for any age.
B0074Y2YZ4|5.0|its not my favorite by Roxette but its real good and the more i play it the more i like it
B00785P2QC|5.0|love this game. finally they make a city building type game that we would all love to play. get it
B00846TTDG|5.0|Overall the movie was really good. Filled with action, a bit of drama, and most of all, military jargon. I even think, the cast was pretty good. Those soldiers can make some money in Hollywood. Just gotta show more emotions. But then again, they're tough SEALS, whooooa!!!<br />And, it would've been nice, if the respective parts were actually filmed in Costa Rica.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire it the #1 app in the app store I like it because it gets you thinking about what you do next and I like it because its challenging and I like a challenge<br />why does it have to be see the answer
B000USU9JY|2.0|I bought this movie for two reasons, Christian Bale is an amazing actor and the subject of insomnia strikes a chord in me because of my struggle with it personally.  I have to admit my review is not nearly complete because I did not watch the entire movie. I just couldn't sit through any more of it. The movie failed to hold my attention despite my appreciation of Bale's usual incredible acting skills.
037582913X|4.0|Out of the small board books we own (and yes, this is a small board book) this is not at all a favorite. We have owned the book for about a month and my 16 month old son, who love books, has yet to get into it. I think the book loses some of the effect because it is small. If you are looking for a small board book, I recommend the Eye Book or Mr. Brown Can Moo instead.<br /><br />Update...Around 19 months he got into this one and at 20 months it was his fav. However, it kinda burned out after a couple months of reading it every night.
B007MNV5WU|2.0|Had I read the reviews BEFORE updating I would of known my progress would be erased! If the reviews were in order by date I would of saw ALL the warnings abt this app.

B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I got this laptop after 6days from order.<br />Dispite of refurbushed latop, funtion spec is good.<br />But I found some scrach at bottom layer and found bad spot at LED screen.<br />But it is no problem to use this laptop.<br />Anyway, tuchpad is too sensitive.<br />But I satisfied with this laptop.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|really fun, its not really about time since it doesn't really matter, but more about the idea of creating something. just remember to hatch the eggs.
B007R41E8O|5.0|so much content.  good story and game lasted forever.  The hint button kept me off walkthroughs when I just needed a little push in the right direction.  will look for another twisted lands game after this.
B000SW16M6|5.0|I had this movie on VHS but it was borrowed and never returned, this blu-ray copy is a lot better than the old VHS.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Best android game I've seen so far. I Wish the game community would make more strategy games like this one.
B005KMX866|5.0|I watched his special on public TV and ordered this CD. It sounds great and you get a few songs that were not on the show.
0345803485|5.0|This book is so amazing and so sweet and so sexy. Obviously this book isn't meant for children but for mature women and men. I say give it a shot. It's a love or hate book. Books like these puts your imagination on a rollercoaster of fun. Sex is beautiful and mature and people enjoy what is in this book. My only con about this book is she is only 21.
B004UNX1LS|1.0|I have this for my ipod touch and true quality is great, but as for my kindle fire its horrible. I would not recommend this to anyone else for the kindle fire, it is always very blurry when I am watching the video and it takes a long time to load 1 video. I am very unhappy with this product and will not be downloading it on my kindle fire again.
0007488122|5.0|It's an excellent book that contains a short biography of the group. The quality of the paper is very good, there are many pictures that shows about the singers life.<br />My daughter was very happy.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This installment picks up 8 years after the previous film. Harvey Dent is still praised as a hero while Batman (Christian Bale) has gone into hiding as a criminal. Our new criminal is Bane (Tom Hardy). He wears a breather mask that makes him look like Hannibal Lechter, but sound like Darth Vader. He is huge and strong plus he has those fancy gizmos and loyal men who work for him. He is a seemingly impossible foe for ailing Batman who kept reminding me of Rocky V.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway makes for an interesting Catwoman who freely walks the line between good and evil. She is perhaps the most complex character in the story. The film has an incredible amount of action with important plot points happening nearly all the time. You don't want to go out for popcorn during the feature, you will be lost when you return. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Blake, a police officer/detective who grew up in an orphanage...do you see it coming?<br /><br />PARENTAL GUIDE: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.
B00004YTIQ|5.0|This cover worked great.  It is big enough to cover my retangular pool.  The color is not dark green like the photo, but is a light blue (somewhat clear) color.  Love how the rope secures the cover under each corner, so it wont blow off or fall into pool.
0470913029|5.0|Great information!  Especially like the recipes!  Format/layout makes this book easy to navigate.  Now it's time to go grocery shopping and start the diet!
1441308660|5.0|Great for travel. I throw my kindle in my backpack and this provides great protection!  It protects the screen with a pad built in to the sleeve.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I am so glad a friend recommended The Kitchen House.<br />It is hard to put down...a real page turner.  A Great Summer read!
B008469DGY|5.0|Great for short or long play.  The sensitivity seems just right.  The ability to control the ball through the entire flight keeps one engaged.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is an enjoyable game because there are so many different boards.  I would recommend this game to anyone.  It is easy to learn and you can pick up a game whenever.
0307352145|5.0|I was so happy to learn that I'm not crazy after all.  Growing up being HSP as well as living it as an adult has definitely had its ups and downs but for some reason there is comfort in knowing there are others out there feeling the same thing.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|One of the best free apps that I have seen for relaxation.  Easy to use and has many sound options.  One word to express this app _ IMPRESSIVE!
0812550706|5.0|Great book deff worth the time to read for any scifi fan , I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series .
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the game its fun and a good way to spend time when you have absolutely nothing to do so add it and you will definetly love it!!!!
B005LAIGNC|5.0|This move should go down as a classic. Yes, some of the acting is mediocre, but the move tells a true story about how far we have come as a country.
0345479092|3.0|We received this book as a gift, and found it extremely helpful to get our baby on the EASY routine, while still allowing for flexibility for those people that have lives that require flexibility.  The problem came as our little girl got a bit older, we didn't know which to do first... extend night time sleep, eliminate naps, extend daytime wakefulness....  It really isn't addressed in this book at all....  So I think version may be a bit too abbreviated for an infant as they transition to different feed and sleep patterns.  I then turned to Babywise, which I was not very fond of...  I definitely like that they touched on the baby as they got older with respect to feed and sleep BUT their methods are a little too tough love for us.  Babywise was very similar, but the \\"cry it out method\\" for our little girl didn't make sense to me.  We then found out that Tracy Hogg has a more detailed book that we just purchased that will ideally help us out with this transition...  \\"The Baby Whisperer Solves All Your Problems:  sleeping, feeding, and behavior- beyond the basics for infancy through toddlerhood\\"....  I think this book may have been the one to get from the get-go!
0307352145|5.0|There was significant prerelease buzz surrounding Susan Cain's latest book. Before the book hit bookstore shelves, advertisements promoting it appeared online and in magazines. Being an introvert, I was eager for its release. After reading it, I was not disappointed.<br /><br />What I liked about Quiet is that it is meticulously well-researched. Ms. Cain traveled the country visiting colleges and churches, attending seminars, and interviewing many people to support her main point which is that we live in an extroverted culture that tries to turn everyone into extroverts through the promotion of an \\"extrovert ideal.\\" She traces the historical roots of this ideal in American society while pointing out the significant contributions that introverts have made through the years. The section on the biological roots of introversion was fascinating and helped explain why some famously introverted performers are extroverts on stage.<br /><br />While there is a lot about introversion that is covered, introverts in the workplace was only briefly discussed.  It might be a good topic for a follow up book. In today's competitive workplace, it seems that extroverts have a leg up. Introverts interview and interact differently than their extroverted counterparts. If a hiring manager happens to be an extrovert, it can be an uphill climb for an introvert to get to the top of applicant  mountain in order to stand out among other job seekers.<br /><br />I found the book to be tremendously helpful and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. I sometimes felt as if I was holding a mirror in my hands as I read because I saw myself in its pages. Like many introverts, I've been labeled aloof, antisocial, shy, reserved and sensitive. After reading Ms Cain's book I found my introversion something to be celebrated rather than something to apologize for. I believe that Quiet will become a contemporary classic for people who want to claim their introverted identity in an extroverted society.<br /><br />Ireceived this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Game is a challenge and moves at great pace. This has difficulty,  is intense,  hard to beat.  By all means the best I have played
0765348276|5.0|I finally succumbed to all of the good reviews that I had read concerning John Scalzi.  In doing so I thought I would start at the beginning with \\"Old Man's War\\".  WOW!  It was refreshing to read a truly good science fiction book for a change.  It does utilize some of the standard themes of traditional Sci-Fi. However, it does so with an original twist.  It also does it with an appropriate amount of humor.  Very well written and entertaining book that I highly recommend to Sci-Fi fans.  John Scalzi has a new fan.<br /><br />Happy reading to all!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is the best in the world. I would get it if I hadn't already. I'd give this company a big thumbs up.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I passed over Slammed many times until my BFF suggested I read it.  Needless to say it is a wonderful story about family, friendship and love.  I cried like a baby and laughed out loud.  Don't pass over it. Read it and you'll be recommending it to your BFF.
B008KRJWEK|1.0|got this app was great for about a month!! until went to play one day and it crashes needs updating!!
B004GYY714|5.0|I am esctastic! My uncle downloaded this app on his Galaxy Tablet,  and I was obsessed with it! Now I have founded it,  I can listen to it whenever I want to! PS it also good because you can listen to different songs without buying them...
B007SGM084|4.0|e-book. It's wonderful to read on my new kindle touch. The story will definitely keep you wanting to read more.
B00846TTDG|4.0|Considering this movie was filmed without great actors I thought it was very accurate, action filled and enjoyable. Would definitely recommend seeing it.
0099579936|4.0|Christian Grey is a character that many can relate to in his desires and attitudes.  He is complex, but seeks to find a relationship that will keep him selfishly happy.  Isn't that what we all secretly want?  He is a rebellious lion in a den of wolves and a thought to realizing your difficult position in comparison to others.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|beats farmville hands down. it is fun to see what animals come up next.  its a must play game for all ages.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This series of books writen by George R.R. Martin are fantastic. Have watched the first two book on cable. Great to read and see what each character looks like. The shaow follows the books really well. I can only hope that another book in the series is to follow soon. They are really addictive, can't put them down. Wasn't much of a reader till I got my Kindle and now it is so easy to have a book with me.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I Have to admit that because of all of the horrible reviews I read about this book I almost didn't read it!!!...I am happy i was pushed into reading it by some girlfriends because I can say I really enjoyed the storyline and did not skip a beat going into the 2nd and third book!!!
B000HKWKBU|5.0|Just as I remembered it from 25 years ago.  Good quality.  Constant uninterrupted streaming.  Nostalgia supreme. I would consider ordering the season.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I'm Starving my Kids...my house is a mess...my family is out of laundry...I am really loving this storyline and I am really afraid to read the last one because i will miss it!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Thought the story line was very interesting.....sex parts entertaining at first, then became too repetative.  Is worth the read and good book for the beach.
B006VA57CY|5.0|A friend recommended I watch Downton Abbey.  I had not seen it during the regular season,  Thankfully, it was on Amazon.  I loved this show and I'm so grateful I could watch, not one, but all the episodes for 2 seasons.  I started watching and could not stop.  I can't wait for it to begin again in the fall.  If I miss an episode, I'll catch it on Amazon!  Thanks Amazon!!
B004CAWSKE|5.0|I ordered this album after a person whose musical taste I appreciate mentioned listening to it.  This album is a good mixture of pop and rock.  It is a tad overproduced, and this makes the vocals hard to understand at times.  Overall, though, it's a great album.  As a fan of Nightwish, Within Temptation, and Evanescence, I feel that Delain nicely compliments the genre.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I love it deciept what people say I play it all the time especially when traveling. I would suggest it to anyone.
0345803485|3.0|This book kept me turning the pages...I guess I just wanted to find out if Ana would sign such a ridiculous contract being the innocent virgin that she was when the book started...however, it was very poor writing.  How many times can one orgasm in one night, especially a man?  After the 5th sex scene and only halfway through the book, I found myself wondering, \\"How many more sex scenes do I have to read through before this book is over?\\"  Also, how many times can one gasp or think- crap, holy crap, double crap, TRIPLE CRAP!??<br /><br />And don't even get me started on the domineering, stalker, over jealous tendencies of Christian Grey.  Way too creepy!!<br /><br />But like I said, it kept me turning pages and I will probably read the next two just to see Christian turn from his domineering \\"I don't make love, I f&*% hard,\\" self into the knight in shining armor husband and father.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is obviously a classic for a reason. I did have a bit of trouble getting into Charlie's narrative at first. He grew on me though. His character is very real and I connected with his emotions. It was a bit of a shock finding out at the very end and things did connect. In all, I think it must have been a very different book back when it was first published. I commend Chbosky and definitely recommend others to give this classic a try.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|The game is pretty good but there are 3 things I don't like 1. Voice Acting Spider-Mans voice is horrible! 2. The pop in is really bad and 3. combat isn't very satisfying and the moves are the same. Buy the app if you have money and it is an O.K buy
B008ODZNLG|5.0|If you like sushi, art and/or philosophy go watch Jiro Dreams of Sushi. If you don't like any of those things... sorry?  Seriously, do yourself a favor and watch this movie.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Hands down the best superhero movie ever made. Smart, fun, and packed with great special effects. All of the actors are so great in this. I loved Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk. Perfect casting all around. The script is just perfect. Such smart writing. Joss Whedon did an amazing job as directer and writer of this film. I hope he comes back for the second.
B0088TG252|4.0|So first off let me say that I have always been a fan of Denzel Washington, but not so much Ryan Reynolds. After not seeing many trailers or previews for Safehouse, I had assumed it would be an action flick with great editing and camera angels, and some well choreographed gun fights; and I was right in that assumption.<br /><br />I would say this movie fits comfortably between two of my favorites, The Bourne Supremacy and Collateral. This film includes excellent vehicle chases like in each of these, along with the realistic cinematography present in most Michael Mann films.<br /><br />As far as plot-holes, continuity and realism, lets just say your suspension of disbelief will have to be set aside.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Book two was a good length but E.L James only repeated parts of book one. To be specific the excessive s&m. There wasn't a plot to book two that wasn't already explained in book one. E. L. James didn't expand the storyline of other characters in the book yet she spoke of characters' children and the employees undying loyaty. The book is still a good read but I suggest for the one or two people who haven't already read the trilogy to just read book one and then jump to book three. You won't even know you missed book two because book two is basically a repeat.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|me and my friends always play it. its REALLY FUN MHM HCHDJDJ DJDJD SJSOWWP DJCHCJDOSSJ DIDUCHCC PWPALSMDF EHD IDOEWP PEJGCHCKS PSKDHC
B000N4SHPS|3.0|This movie was...interesting.  As others said, it's pretty sad and depressing, but life can be that way.  It's perfectly understandable to mourn a spouse but after three years it'd have been sweet to see him just begin move on, either with Marie (too May-December?) or another nice lady.  He could even get some \\"sign\\" from Adrian that it's okay to move on! But, the man has always dealt with life by stepping into the ring, so there you have it.<br /><br />I liked how he told his son not to let anyone treat him like crap, but notice how even after seeing Robert's boss be a jerk to him, Rocky was still polite to the boss, for Robert's sake.  He's come a long way. :) Normally he'd just pound the guy into the ground.<br /><br />I liked the closure of a \\"draw\\" that ultimately goes to the other guy (just like in the very first fight with Apollo).  Because it didn't matter.  Rocky went the distance and still felt victorious.  It was that way in 1976 and it was that way this time.<br /><br />I liked the nostalgia, too.  It was all so bittersweet. I loved that Duke was still with him, and that he and Paulie were still close.  They both loved Adrian so, though Paulie used to be so mean to her.<br /><br />In summary: It's not the Feel Good Movie of the Year, and Adrian being gone is so damn sad.  And again, it would have been really nice for Rocky to have another woman in his life, in his corner. Well who knows? Maybe he does develop something with Marie! We don't know. At least she was in Vegas, playing the role of ringside female companion, cringing at the bad blows! I was glad he had that; he always had that with Adrian.<br /><br />The appearance, somehow, of Drago and Clubber would have been AMAZINGLY cool but I can't fathom how that would work! Tommy Gunn, too, but with BETTER HAIR! I could never get past his hair.<br /><br />Having Spider Rico around was an obvious attempt to wrap things up full circle (he's in the very first seen of Rocky); sort of gratuitous.<br /><br />Stallone's body is pretty smoking for that age, but his awful plastic surgery (facial) is VERY distracting.  I'd give my right arm to see what he and Mickey Rourke would look like had they never carved up their faces.<br /><br />Bottom line: Totally watchable but rent, don't buy it.  It's not a big time investment and all Rocky fans should get the closure! Just don't make a big Blu-Ray or DVD investment.
B007NUP80C|5.0|I love it!!! The box, the content and the 2 CD's It is a really excellent work. I love her, her music and her voice.
034580404X|5.0|50 Shades Trilogy arrived in excellent shape and new. Books are quality made and easy to read. All 3 came in one sleeve for easy storage. I am looking forward to reading all of these books.
B002IKLZZY|5.0|Great, suspensful movie. I've seen it half a dozen times and always enjoy it over and over again.  One you can see repetitively without getting tired of it.  Cary Grant is awesome as always.
0345536886|5.0|One of the funniest books I have ever read, yet has its serious moments also. If you are a Grisham fan, I recommend reading it.
B00005JJX8|5.0|Great movie, but the subtitles weren't in English for the words that were spoken in another language.  That was the only issue I had with the movie.  Great scenery of Cary Grant, oh and the towns and landscape scenery were lovely, too.
1609613937|5.0|First heard about Mc Doughalls diet from the book \\"Forks over Knives\\" which is also a great book & a must read. The Starch Solution has easy to make, no animal products, nor oil recipes that are great tasting & satisfying! I can have late dinners & am still losing weight because its so healthy. No need to diet when you eat whats made for your body.
B007UW9VWO|3.0|Here are all the rarest treasures of the sea (and surely the most endangered) offered up to the richest pocket in an insular and privileged world of high end Sushi. This film lavishes praise upon the those who dedicate their entire lives to emptying our oceans, from the Sushi masters to their suppliers to the customers they serve. Though the craft itself is fascinating I would have been far more comfortable seeing a pastry chef make a vegetarian quiche than watch a living octopus being suffocated in a plastic bag at a fish market for the purpose of high \\"art\\".<br /><br />This film barely addresses the health crises of our oceans that is at the mercy of the hubris of the Japanese people and other nations in pursuit of the \\"finest\\" and  \\"greatest\\" for profit. Several times Japanese career veterans in the film state no interest in profit yet they are only selling to the highest bidder. The film also seems to disparage the inability of the younger generation to embrace a solid samurai (and very male) ethic which calls for serving one master (be it a career or a father) for life, finding satisfaction in doing the same thing every single day, improving incrementally. Apparently patience and humility are held in high regard. Yet I see the Japanese in the film prone to egotism, the lure of the big idea and sudden success. The sushi master's sons are shown to be running high end sushi restaurants which depend very specifically on such endangered resources. I disagree with the implication that the younger generation specifically do not possess the same level of dedication and persistence in pursuing a career, an idea, etc. I find some of the younger generation to be very passionate about the all the things this film leaves out and very troubled by the decision of the prior generation.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|It has a nice mix of sudukos including the non traditional.  Most suduko games are just the traditional 9 squares in 3 rows and columns and one can easily get bored with them.  I find the non-traditional games are more fun to play since they add a new level of complexity.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I heard someone say: \\"It's like crack on paper, You can't stop\\" and I am afraid he was right. Also the extras are very useful especially the annotated list of characters if one gets lost again.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|As a casual listener, with experience limited pretty much to the Saturday Night Fever disco era and songs that were performed by others like Barbra Streisand and Dionne Warwick, I find this collection satisfying. There are the songs I knew and expected along with a few I did not know but came to enjoy instantly. I even found some songs that I knew but had not heard in ages and simply forgot. In this collection they did \\"cover\\" some of their songs recorded by other artists, but that is not a negative for me. I enjoy the covers enough, and it just adds to my collection since I have some of the original recordings on other artists' albums.<br /><br />I stumbled across this 2-CD set in a store at a slightly lower price than the current online price. The price combined with the simplistic cover art made me highly suspicious about the quality, but I snapped it up anyway without doing my research. When I put disc one into my laptop, I was immediately impressed by the clarity of the sound. Granted, some of these songs may not have the same depth they did on vinyl, but for a CD on my average laptop speakers, this sounds very good. On the first play, I was hooked from the first song, \\"You Should Be Dancing.\\" I decided then and there that I should be, got up, and did my strut.<br /><br />I moved through this collection easily, not fast-forwarding or skipping a single song. Good music must not be for everyone, but I think the diehard mockers of the Bee Gees should give the lyrics, harmonies, and enticing melodies more consideration. These songs stand the test of time. For the song selection (based on what little I know) and sound quality, I would be comfortable recommending this collection to someone looking for an introduction to the Bee Gees.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|I heard this album in its entirety for the first time at my brother's Fourth of July party this year.  This album is another turn in a different direction for Rush.  This band keeps evolving musically seemingly with each album they put out, and Clockwork Angels is no exception.  Even in their late fifties and early sixties, Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and Neil Peart keep on evolving and most important of all, keep on rocking.<br /><br />So far, this is a 4-star album, but I say \\"so far\\" because it seems that so many Rush albums grow on me over time.  Eventually I end up raising my rating of the album.  We'll see if it happens again with Clockwork Angels.<br /><br />I definitely plan to purchase this album soon, as I have all the Rush albums and want to add this to my collection.
B007JCP8FE|3.0|Less than a few months ago, members of Shinedown were interviewed on the Fuse music channel. My initial impression of Brent Smith and the rest of the members were of men who genuinely appreciate all of their fans. However, I was still initially uncertain about getting the album because of my neutral feelings about the song \\"Bully\\".  I admit that I was more accustomed to the hopeful messages in songs such as \\"Second Chance\\" and \\"If You Only Knew\\".  \\"Second Chance\\" was also one of the songs that helped me cope with my summer 2009 transition from the military to eventual civilian life. Their recent decision to hold a one day 99 cent sale on their mp3 album persuaded me to purchase their album.  Amaryllis is definitely a bargain for the 99 cent sale that was temporarily offered. My reason for this sentiment is due to my enjoyment of the following high-energy and motivational tracks: \\"Adrenaline\\",\\"Miracle\\", \\"Unity\\", and \\"Amaryllis\\". Please understand that I am aware why many millions of others may enjoy \\"Bully\\" and/or rank this collection higher. The only reason why I ranked \\"Amaryllis\\" three stars was due to my feeling that there could have been more upbeat songs in this compilation to balance out the more somber musical tracks. This is because I felt some powerful energy from their happier tracks that helped to add strength to the whole compilation. \\"Amaryllis\\" does grow on the listener after each successive listen of the whole album.  This album is definitely worth it if purchased as an MP3 album for less than five U.S. dollars or as a CD that is nine dollars or less. For this reason, \\"Amaryllis\\" is more for the listening audience that enjoys hearing \\"Bully\\" and/or those who are fine with a musical creation that has more tragic songs than upbeat tunes.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I really wanted it to rain or have a storm in a long time. now I can have one! I almost fell asleep right away. 2 things that could be easilly changed, one, I think when u go to ur home page it should still be playing. the second, u should be able to pick as meny sounds as u want. but besides that I highly recommend this app. :]
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is very fun but sometimes gets on my nerves because its addicting. I still love this app though
B008MEM24S|5.0|i love this game soooo much its a realy  fun game its as fun as the original wheres my water
B0055SWM08|5.0|This App has everything you could ask...easy to play...challenging to master....a lot of various layouts and ways to finish them (even if your not perfect you can move on).  Overall just highly enjoyable.
B0045DO932|5.0|Good:  Personally this is my favorite My Chemical Romance CD.  It's A LOT different compared to their older CDs.  It seems like a lot of fans that prefer the darker side of the band, didn't like this album because it brings out a lot more color.  People say the band changed, but they're still 100% themselves in this album.  Anyway, I would definitely suggest getting this album. If you're not sure about getting it, check out some of the songs off Youtube.<br /><br />Bad:  The one thing I don't like about it, is that if you get the clean version that says Danger Days on the front, it doesn't have any lyrics or band photos.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|I just need everyone that sees to vote 1 star for all these crapps so that they go down and the new good ones go up.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very addictive book love the way it captivates my mind would recommend it to anyone cant wait to finish the third book the mockingjay
B0007TKNII|5.0|A big apology to all those Brightman/Crawford fans whose dreams were dashed eons ago when this film's production was pushed back --- I'm sure many would have enjoyed such a late 80s/early 90s camp fest. But this movie - and it's actors - belong to the younger generation of Phans, who thoroughly enjoy the fact that Christine is not disturbingly bug-eyed and the Phantom's voice isn't so shrill (don't get me wrong, I love Barnum, gosh darn it).<br /><br />The music is lush,  the costumes are gorgeous (though the Hannibal array should have gone unchanged, the absence of the China-man robe is a welcome sight), and the existence of another cast recording should make everyone happy.<br /><br />The only real downsides?<br />1) Patrick Wilson as Raoul<br />2) The awkward talky bits that should have been sung through<br />3) The fact that the Phantom's disfigurement is redolent of a sunburn
B0086QS7N2|5.0|Rush boasts an amazing body of work, spanning periods defined by specific musical styles, from the long-form concept albums of the 70's, to the synth-laden, more radio friendly tracks of the 80's, to the grungier, more straight ahead rock of the 90's, to the power trio re-birth starting with Vapor Trails.  Clockwork Angels is really all of those periods brilliantly captured and rolled into one masterpiece of an album.  That's enough words; listen for yourself.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Hugo's Les Miz translated so well to the stage, it's no wonder a spectacle championing liberty, free will, and martyrdom worked even better in the arena. The sheer energy and unbridled theatrical hoopla make it a sight to be seen. Granted, Lea Salonga lacks some of the firetruck vocal power associated with Fantine's character, and Nick Jonas's caterwauling belongs on the Disney Channel more than at the O2 ---  but grandstand performances by Alfie Boe, Samantha Barks, Norm Lewis, and Ramin Karimloo far outweigh the weaker trappings. The last twenty minutes of the show, wherein the original cast, anniversary casts, and high school casts join together to sing sums up the whole of Les Miz, immortalizing it's message and making for a bloody good show.
B001CXMJTE|3.0|The condition was excellent. Hemingway gave vivid descriptions of the spanish countryside.  However, the description of the charcters was somewhat lacking.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Whether you adore Love Never Dies or absolutely despise it, I think we can all be grateful for the vocal union of Sierra Boggess and Ramin Karimloo that allowed this production to be possible. I honest to goodness cannot think of a better cast or more stunning venue for Phantom's 25th anniversary. The fact that it is a more intimate story meant that it lent itself to a theatre far more than Les Miz's O2 Arena spectacle, and Royal Albert Hall provides a dazzling backdrop.<br /><br />They really pulled out all the stops: most notably the descent to the lair. Magnificent. They removed those horrid puffy shoulders from Christine's star princess costume, and unlike the Rossum/Butler movie version, chose a Raoul (one Hadley Fraser) who could hold his own as a character that half the fan base wishes Punjab-ed.<br /><br />The encore performances are okay, but the real fun is when ALW, in his creepy purple shirt, announces ex-wife Sarah Brightman as his \\"Angel of Music\\" and then proceeds (failingly) to hug her.
B003HARV3Y|1.0|I didn't buy it here; though I think it is cheaper to get it on Amazon.<br />I wanted to give feedback about the movie; don't read if you don't want spoilers.<br /><br />Introduction: I loved the animation and lightening effects, there was no defects there. However, once they introduced \\"Zeus\\" and \\"Poseidon\\"... I didn't want to watch the rest of the movie. Especially when they show the Empire State building. First of all, the movie was supposed to start off from Percy's point of view and reveal later when he goes to Camp Half Blood about the war that was going to erupt.<br /><br />Zeus: FAILURE! He didn't hold any real authority in his appearance. He's also not supposed to be a chunky overweight middle aged man. He's supposed to have had a storm cloud beard and hair. His outfit is supposed to be in professional stuck-up pin stripped suits.<br /><br />Poseidon: FAILURE! He was supposed to have BLACK HAIR like Percy. He was also supposed to have a more strong appearance. I believe the actor who played him really killed his character. He was also supposed to have sun wrinkles around his eyes that show he smiles alot...<br /><br />Both Percy and his father are supposed to have the same black hair and green eyes. I think the actor who played Percy has blue eyes? Which on a technical level messes up the physical details of the characters.<br /><br />Percy Jackson: I believe that they picked the perfect boy actor for Percy. Although it seemed that he was \\"stiff\\" in many emotional aspects of his character. He didn't present any \\"fun loving\\" get-at-it attitude like Percy in the books. It was like he was detached the entire time.<br /><br />Grover: 100% FAILURE! The major issues was with his personality and is \\"gun-how\\" attitude. In Book 1, Chapter 1, page [3]: --\\"Grover was an easy target. He was scrawny. He cried when he got frustrated. He must've been held back several grades, because he was the only sixth grader with acne and a start of a wispy beard on his chin.\\" In themovie, his character is headstrong and wants to GOGOGOGOGOGO. It completely destroys Grover's character development in the book series. :/<br /><br />Mr. Brunner: SUCCESS! He had the tweed jacket, the wheelchair, the hair, the beard and the right welcoming warm face. They picked the perfect middle aged male actor to play as Mr. Brunner (Chiron in disguise). I believe he was the only one that actually got to stay true to his character. (Probably because he was more years of experience in acting, anyway)<br /><br />School field trip: 40% Success. 60% Failure. The museum was a success, its interior, everything. However, the field trip did not start right off there. They were supposed to be driving in a school buss where Nancy Bobofit (who had been slashed from the movie), was picking on Grover. Percy in turn, tries to defend his best friend Grover from being hit with wads of sandwich that stuck in his curly brown hair. It really hurts Percy's character for not adding this scene in because before he explains all the strange occurrences that happened in his life that labeled him a \\"failure student\\" and a \\"troubled kid.\\"<br /><br />Mrs. Dodds: Too quick to reveal her true form as a \\"Fury.\\" She was supposed to be wearing a leather jacket. Her physical appearance was alright but I didn't get the feeling of \\"Georgian\\" as the book describes her to be. Slashing her background and involvement with Percy also kind of hurt in certain areas.<br /><br />Getting caught by Mrs. Dodds: 100% FAILURE! There were no \\"ear buds\\" or apple ipod being played in the book. Percy gets called out by Mr. Brunner when Nancy Bobofit couldn't shut up about a naked guy on a stele, where he turned around and said \\"Will you shut up?\\" in a loud voice. That's when Mr. Brunner asks him if he had anything to say about the exhibit and about why Kronos ate his children. Mrs. Dodds did not call out Percy then! After they had left the museum to get lunch and when Nancy picks on Grover got on Percy's last strawand sent her flying into a water fountain is when she called it out. The disappearing act up the stairs was botched by her slight disappearing act into the room (which is right for the most part), where he's supposed to kill her.<br /><br />Fury (Mrs. Dodds): I think for the most part, her demon appearance was an success? BUT! She was not supposed to GET AWAY. Percy ends up slashing her with riptide and disintegrates into a spin-wheel of dust. Having Grover there alongside Mr. Brunner destroyed this scene. Grover never goes inside with the latin teacher, he remains outside where Nancy Bobofit gloats about a \\"Mrs. Kurr\\" (a different teacher that the \\"Mist\\" created) giving him a butt whooping, so-to-speak.<br /><br />Going Home: 100% FAILURE! They totally cut off the biggest part of the book where Grover and Mr. Brunner talk behind Percy's back about the summer solstice deadline. Especially when they ride on the travel bus on the way home for summer break. The most important part is when the bus breaks down in front of the three fates sitting at a (gas station? fruit stand?) and cuts the life cord of someone. I believe by leaving this out, really throws off the plot to the whole series about whose destined to die. . _ .<br /><br />Sally Jackson: SUCCESS! They found the perfect actress to play Percy's mother. They got her physical appearance down to a \\"T.\\" However, she could've been more headstrong in certain areas. Specially, where she's supposed to gather her wits like she does in the book and protect her loved ones.<br /><br />Gabe (Not so smelly?): His actor ALMOST got it right. He was supposed to be more \\"walrus\\" shaped. Cutting his poker game which was supposed to happen when Percy walks in after ditching Grover at a public restroom area destroys his character personality. Beer bottles, cigars and smoke was supposed to be evident. Also, the part where Gabe sniffs out the money left over in Percy's pocket and threatens him to hand it over. Slashing the mess and disgust that Gabe presents to Percy upon returning home also affects this scene. How are you supposed to get the interpretation of \\"Smelly,\\" when you cut out major parts of character developments?<br /><br />The apartment scene overall: Percy's mother's not supposed to be in the apartment when he first comes home. Gabe is the only one he meets with his poker buddies. Then, he was supposed to enter his trashed bedroom that was filled with muddy boots, empty beer bottles and whatever else was mentioned in the book that Gabe thought of stuffing in there to spite Percy. Grover is also not supposed to be there, popping in on the apartment. Percy doesn't run into Grover until the vacation down on the beach where Percy and his mother borrow Gabe's car with a lot of fuss. And THAT'S WHEN the dream about an Eagle and Horse were fighting each other (Zeus and Poseidon).<br /><br />Racing to Camp half blood: When Percy gets agitated and concerned asking Grover about what he was, Grover was supposed to \\"Blaah-ha-ha!\\" And the interaction was completely wrong. Percy asked (In Chapter 4, page [44]; at the bottom of the page)--\\"Um... what are you, exactly?\\" Grover said: \\"It doesn't matter right now.\\" Then Percy replied: \\"It doesn't matter? From the waist down, my best friend is a donkey--\\", which is were Grover let out a sharp, throaty \\"Blaa-ha-ha!\\" and cried \\"Goat!\\" And Percy goes: \\"What?\\" And Grover replies: \\"I'm a Goat from the waist down.\\" and Percy answers: \\"You just said it didn't matter.\\"---Cutting this whole scene really destroyed it. That and Grover was NOT awake or physically conscious when running to C.H.B.. Grover was knocked out because of the Minotaur flipped Gabes car into a ditch. Percy and his mother were the ones dragging his goaty butt towards camp.<br /><br />Fighting the Minotaur: 100% FAILURE! Percy doesn't have the sword with him! He gave it back to Chiron at the school trip. Grover is not supposed to be there egging him on to defeat the thing either. GROVER ISSUPPOSED TO BE KNOCKED OUT, like he always does. There was also no door-way or arch-way leading into Camp Half Blood.<br /><br />Camp Half Blood: 100% FAILURE! First of all, they slashed Thalia's tree from the WHOLE story. That destroys her character appearance, history and development. Second of all, I'll just say that the Cabins were wrong. It looked like it all came out of Per 1. It was RIDICULOUS! - . - They also disregarded the campfire and the sacrificial food scraps to the gods. :/ Argus the 100 eye'd security guard was also cut out, as well as Dionysus. And where was Clarisse? She's supposed to be the key player in picking on Percy and revealing he is the son of Poseidon during the capture the flag night. Which, of course, was also slashed horribly. Annabeth and Percy were supposed to be on the same side during capture the flag. Not just Luke and Percy! The whole water-healing scene was good but everything else was choppy. Third of all, there are no Oracles?! The corpse hippie has also been slashed--so, the quest isn't given right. Nor does anyone hear of any prophecies... What was the whole point of making a movie if you aren't going to keep true to the key parts of the series?<br /><br />Annabeth: FAILURE! Supposed to be blonde haired, gray-eyed and have a California appearance.<br /><br />Luke: 80% FAILURE! 20% SUCCESS is for keeping true to his sandy blonde hair (I can't remember if his eyes were right--but they're supposed to be blue). They revealed that Luke was playing video games. I mean, c'mon. The \\"techno\\" stuff wasn't in any of the series besides cellphones and even then, they only thing really used was laptops because it sent up Monster flares telling them where they were. Luke was also supposed to have a long white dragon scar on one of his eyes from going on that quest from his father Hermes to get he \\"forbidden fruit\\" and got injured from Landon.<br /><br />Chiron (Mr. Brunner): 50% FAILURE! In centaur form, Chiron is supposed to be a WHITE STALLION--NOT BROWN!<br /> Although his character is played beautifully, his outer appearance really slashed it.<br /><br />The Quest: 100% FAILURE! The quest to the underworld and meeting the major monster characters were completely wrong. There was nothing about \\"marble this\\" \\"marble that\\". Percy only receives three white milky marbles from his father back in Santa Monica Bay from a water lady. Medusa was also supposed to be a middle eastern woman and never reveals who she is. There's also NO humans around when Percy, Annabeth and Grover end up there during their quest. It made me sad they cut out the scene where Percy had to say hello to the Pink Poodle. :( Hades appearance was ALSO HORRIBLY WRONG! He looked like Jaguar... And his wife was not supposed to be there either. Nor was Percy traveling with a metal shield given to him from Luke. The only thing Luke gave Percy as he was going on his quest was those winged shoes, which was also misused. The winged shoes brought Percy in Zeus's domain and if he ever dared to fly with them, he'd be shot down like a pigeon. He gave the shoes to Grover. ARES was supposed to play the biggest key part in the quest since he was the God who was \\"turned\\" being brain washed from Kronos. The lightening bolt is supposed to appear in the blue backpack Ares gives to Percy after they fetch his war shield back to him from the abandoned Water-land exhibit. (And so on)<br /><br />I'll cut it short here. Basically, the producer slashed the entire series. It wasn't really worth it to buy the movie. Previously there was a movie trailer where they showed a girl named Clarisse wearing camouflage who had been doused in toilet water because of Percy. I don't know why they scrapped it? And I'm not sure if anyone else saw it but I did, on YOUTUBE.<br /><br />The major key players that had been taken out of the movie really affected the development. The look and feel of Mount Olympus was cheap and completely ruined what I had envisioned from Rick Riordan... I believe they would have done a better job if they weren't so \\"gun-how\\" to earn more money. :/ If they want to continue this movie series, they need to RE-START from scratch and go by the book. Otherwise... I will only stick to the books and that's about it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The first chapter didn't really grab me, but when I clicked to the second chapter, I was hooked.  This book is so well written that I can't help but tell everyone I know about it.  You go back and forth between Nick's present day perspective to Amy's diary entries from the past.  Slowly, her diary brings us to present day Amy.  Just when you think you know what is going on, Flynn drops a bomb on you that you are totally unprepared for.  What a great book.  At the end of the book, you can't tell if you like the characters or if you hate them.  If anything, I certainly admire the characters because they are unimaginably smart and resilient.  Great read!
B008CP93S0|5.0|I'm a 32 year old female who is not easily offended nor am I uncomfortable at the sight of a naked man in a movie. Shocked? Maybe, but only because this is so rare in non-pornographic films. In fact, I always wonder why female nudity is more widely accepted in movies whereas if you see a naked guy it's like you splashed acid into a person's eyes. This movie is for adults who have a good sense of humor and, as others have mentioned, are not easily offended. If you are the type that is easily offended that's fine just stick to Disney movies please.<br /><br />I gotta say I didn't expect to really like this movie. I had never even heard of it up until it appeared in my local Redbox. Paul Rudd? Yes, please! If you're a fan of his style of comedy, do yourself a favor and watch this film. I loved the acting. I loved that the movie surprised me in good ways. Where I expected at first to only laugh a little I ended up laughing a lot. Enough to draw tears and make my family wonder what I was watching that made me involuntarily imitate an upset hyena. I just couldn't help it.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I read this book reviewed by Time magazine and decided to buy it.<br /><br />The writer is very skilled and the whole book goes forward with two protagonists.  Each one is telling their own story about the events.  It is not confusing as you go back and forth between these two characters - but is rather exciting.<br />Sometimes you see it going one way and then the story, and crime, go another way. Just when I though that I had it figured out - the author closed that door and showed you more information.<br />This is a completely engaging novel and I really did have trouble putting it down. I actually stayed up into the wee hours of the morning - because I HAD to know.<br />The ending is very good.<br /><br />I would suggest this book for any readers who think that they always know what is coming next.<br /> Not in this book!!!

0312641893|4.0|This is one of those books that suddenly popped up all around the blogosphere, so it took me awhile to finally pick it up and read. Happy to say that it lived up to all of the good buzz!<br /><br />My first thought was that this would be another fairy tale mashup, but it's not. Well, it sorta kinda is, but not really. There's the unwanted Cinder who was adopted by a man shortly before he died of the plague. She is left with her mean \\"stepmother\\" and two \\"stepsisters\\". The younger sister seems sweet, but the other two don't really like Cinder and aren't afraid to let her know it. There's even a handsome prince and a ball, but that's more or less where the Cinderella comparisons stop. Well, aside from her pumpkin-like transport to the ball. :)<br /><br />Cinder is a talented mechanic who just happens to be a cyborg. She doesn't remember anything before the surgery which saved her life, but is a survivor. As a cyborg, she technically belongs to her stepmother, has no rights because she's considered property, and she cannot keep any of her earnings.<br /><br />I don't really understand the prejudice against cyborgs, as I think that would be beyond cool! How convenient to have a handy little indicator to let you know whenever someone is lying? And a mechanical leg that you could store things in? How awesome would that be? Unfortunately, it's not an easy life, but Cinder somehow manages to stay strong. I really liked Cinder, as she didn't let the constant emotional and mental abuse from her so-called family break her spirit!<br /><br />A chance encounter with the handsome Prince Kai sets her on a path to an unexpected adventure. He was looking for a mechanic to repair his companion android. Turns out the life of a prince isn't so easy either. His country is suffering from the plague, and they are dealing with threats from the evil Queen Lunar. Very evil woman! E-vile!<br /><br />Really loved the characters in this story! Cinder's companion android Iko is a blast! Such a big personality in such a little robot! Kai and Cinder are both great characters! And how cool that Kai didn't look down on Cinder, but actually seemed to like her! Go Kai!<br /><br />This is a great start to a great new series! Was fast paced, had a great plot with interesting and believable characters, and the writing is out of this world! My only complaint was the cliff-hanger ending, and that I have to wait until next year for the next book to come out!ig personality in such a little robot! Kai and Cinder are both great characters!

1439170916|5.0|As human beings we fear most what we cannot see or understand.<br />'The Hound of the Baskervilles' remains an ageless thriller because it is about the family curse that allows an unseen, spectral terror to strike anytime at will on the innocent, young, handsome and brave, with no warning or knowledge on what to do to confront it.<br />  The Emperor of Maladies is such a compelling detective story,  Perhaps more so, since about 1 in 3 of those reading it will, in their lifetimes, actually make acquaintance with the central villain of the story  It is a tale with many heroes, like Sherlock Holmes, who piece together bit by bit, albeit over  decades,  the puzzles of cancer, and how  ultimately to seek out and destroy this formidable foe.<br /> Siddhartha Mukherjee describes  how Sidney Farber, perhaps the Louis Pasteur of the Cancer,  who before anyone had discovered DNA or what it does,  did the first heroic experiments to invent chemotherapy, in 1947.  Many of his associates and students then spread out to MD Anderson in Houston (the Vegas of Cancer hospitals)  and other sites around the US.  There lead  to many of  lone researcher who worked, often against ridicule, to come up with daring experiments finding where the Emperor might be vulnerable.  But 'Chemotherapy is like beating a dog with a stick to get rid of its fleas' , and success in the War against Cancer, over the next 4 decades, was limited, at best measured in the few to several additional months that those diagnosed with cancer might be expected to live.<br />  This started to change in the late 1980s-early 90s, when researchers discovered the 2 mechanisms of molecular biology at the heart of every cancer - normal genes that go abnormal (oncogenes)  by triggering uncontrolled cell division, and normally tumor suppressing genes that lose their ability to suppress runaway tumor growth.  Cancer, was at the heart, like Grendel in Beowulf, only a distorted form of ourselves - yes, the enemy was lurking to strike within us, all along in our normal cells, bodies, our fate written in our evolution.  But  now , at least, with the keyholes had been identified, the right molecular keys had to found  to target these errant genes - without, of course,  disrupting the complex biochemical pathways that otherwise kept the patient alive.<br />  Even as Mukherjee is able to skillfully explain the scientific and medical intricacies of each new challenge, or attempted cure, he seamless bring in the human stories of the patients, the frontline casualities in this War, fought without pity, without sentimentality, on both sides.<br /> The fortitude and heroism of the patients, most memorably of 3 year old  Robert Sandler, the first recipient of chemotherapy - (the book is dedicated to this boy) - is deftly included in every chapter of the story. We can all identify with these victims.. As Steve Jobs said 'Even if we want to go to Heaven, we dont want to die to get there.'<br /> Towards the end of the book,  Mukherjee gets more cautiously optimistic that more battles are being won in the War.  There is the compelling story of how Dennis Slamon of UCLA  drove the first clinical trials of Herceptin curing Barbara Bradfield  of breast cancer - this was a drug which Genentech almost never made - a unusual case of an academic showing the way to a for-profit corporation.<br />  Throughout the book there are insightful observations on the value of basic research vs. daring experimentation by bold researchers leading to serendipitous cures  (for patients who had no other option) . History is apparently replete with examples of very successful cures, even if the underlying mechanism remained mysterious for decades.<br /><br />Read this amazing book, even if we hope against the 1 in 3 chance of  personally meeting its subject in our lifetimes.
B007K54KI6|5.0|Out Of The Game is by far, Rufus's greatest album he's ever created.  Getting together with Mark Ronson--who also produced Amy Winehouse's Back to Black album--produced it with Rufus.  Enlisting The Dap Kings was the smartest thing ever to do if Rufus wants to show his adoring fans.  My heart continues to swell every time Ronson backs up an artist.  Amy Winehouse may not have been everyones favorite idol, but to me she could sing the blues like no other.  In this album, Rufus tackles the 70s genre and you can hear that he as well can sing the blues just as well as Amy; pouring his heart our for his audience in what he even says is \\"the best I've ever sounded on a record\\".  My favorite songs are the following: Jericho, Rashida, Barbara, Song for you.  My dream is to pull an Uncle Jesse--from Full House--and perform to my husband at our wedding \\"Song for you\\" because to me, it is one of the most passionate songs I've heard. I'm gay, Rufus is gay; he has always been a voice I've heard over my adult years.  This entire record is what music is suppose to be about.  Love.<br /><br />Barbara is by far one of my favorite songs to do the charleston to, while I sing it as if I were the one performing it.  And Jericho is about letting go of yourself and singing every word as if it were your last.<br /><br />I recommend this album to anyone who feels that listening to Rufus album can help solve a bad day purely by enjoying him and singing along because you love matching his awesomeness.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|I always enjoyed this movie when it was on DVD and even though i owned it already decided to upgrade to a blu-ray. i always enjoy the clearer, sharper picture and more vibrant sound. i don't give story lines away in reviews but if you have never seen it, watch the previews online for free, and see if your interested. i thought it was an excellent movie overall and can enjoy the movie experience even more on the blu-ray.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am not a prude and object to reading a love scene with vivid desciptions, but this was HORRIBLE!  If I was about 14 and my girlfriend and I sat and dreamed what the perfect man would be I can already imagine the conversation.----he should have money, a LOT so that we can have kids, travel, and live the life of rich people (remember this is my 14 year old child inside of me talking).  He should be so handsome that it is fantastic.  He should live in a big mansion and have a lot of help so we don't ever have to clean or cook.  We could wake up every morning and have sex (yes, some fourteen year olds think that is what marriage is like),(I taught school and heard a lot), and on and on.... Well, my fourteen year old self would say that this author wrote this book from my fantasies.  If I was really fourteen I would think this was a literary masterpiece.  Well, I am much older (let's not mention numbers) and was gagging from this book.  It has such catchy phrases such as--\\"oh, Mr Grey, Yes, Mr. Grey, What Mr Grey?, then repeat those about what seems a thousand times.  I did finish the book but it never got better, just worse.  What really upsets me is how popular these books are.  I hate the thought that the author is making a boat-load of money off of this \\"50 shades of junk\\" book.

B007PWXQWA|5.0|Exquisitely sensitive and empathic performances of tunes by Bill Evans, John Coltrane, and Ornette Coleman -- along with standards made famous by Jim Hall and others -- make this Abercrombie's best album in years. Gone is the overly tart tone that plagued some of the guitarist's '90s releases; his sound here is closer to his classic work in the '70s with Ralph Towner and the Abercrombie Quartet.  You couldn't ask for more copacetic, A-list sidemen than Drew Gress, Joey Baron, and Joe Lovano. Between them, they have so much talent and imagination that these mellow, moody, probing performances are a marvel of contained power. It's also frankly nice to see an ECM release based on standards.  That may seem like a \\"duh!\\" -- a jazz release based on standards, what a concept! -- but ECM genius Manfred Eicher has clearly pushed his stable of brilliant musicians to favor original compositions over the decades, so to hear this ensemble find its own completely fresh way through a tune like \\"Flamenco Sketches\\" (which is virtually uncoverable, because the original on Kind of Blue is so iconic) is breathtaking.  Music simply doesn't get better than this.

B003NS0PT2|3.0|I've watched this series from the beginning, and find it compelling enough to continue.  Some things need to be said though about the way healthcare is portrayed.  Clearly, one message from the start of BB has been that the treatment you receive is based on ability to pay for services rendered.  If you don't actually work in this area, I suppose it makes sense to you.  I have 16+ years of experience in 6 different hospitals over that time period. I routinely see patients receive care that is unlikely to be paid for.  Also, it's common for those with little or no insurance to be subsidized by government programs, or the hospital itself. My hospital writes off millions in care every year. Someone in Walt's situation would not be expected to pay for chemotherapy, radiation treatment, etc. up front.  I have never seen that happen. I have seen a drug dealer spend a 9 month period in the hospital, after being shot by a rival.  Unlikely he'll pay one cent on his bills.  The fact is, those of us who work \\"regular\\" jobs subsidize those who don't.  The views expressed in the series are very inaccurate in my opinion. It's become popular to villify healthcare, and those of us who provide it, as greedy individuals focused exclusively on the bottom line. If it was possible for you to follow me on an average day at work, I would'nt have to tell you how true what I wrote above is.  You would see it for yourselves.

0307949486|4.0|This is a stunning feminist novel, even though I have not seen or heard that word once in any reviews or discussions. I was actually resistant to reading the book, because it annoys me when people refer to men as men and women as girls, and the \\"girl\\" in this story, Lisbeth Salander, is actually a 24-year-old woman who only looks much younger.<br /><br />So I was surprised that Stieg Larsson was actually extremely pro-woman, and realistically so... that is, he doesn't idealize women, and his women have their flaws just as his men do, and some are downright cranky and hateful... but the statistics about the abuse of women by men that begin each section of the book are the hint to the deeply felt message underlying this story. Larsson supports the respect for and protection of women without ever moralizing or lecturing.<br /><br />There is one of the most satisfying revenge scenes I have ever heard of, and<br />I liked how Blomkvist and Salander both used thoughts of lessons they had learned, he in the military and she with a guardian, to help them deal successfully with intense situations, not panic, make the right choices, and survive.<br /><br />I enjoyed the pulse-pounding drama of some of the crime-story parts, and was amazed at the extensive knowledge of the corporate, rich family, sociological, psychological, vast computer systems, guilty secrets, and less rigid sexual satisfaction and relationship worlds (these last two I found refreshing).<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander is in many ways no more important to the story than her temporary partner in research, reporter/writer Mikael Blomkvist, and her dragon tattoo is pretty much irrelevant, but Larsson's insight into her mind, behavior, and intelligence is wonderful.<br /><br />I did find the ending something of a let-down, not in what happens, but in the writing style, but was still left wanting to know more about Lisbeth, what she does next, and how exciting the next story will be -- although Mikael fills up the story as much or even more than she does, she is the far more interesting character, so much so, that the book is titled for her.<br /><br />The translation from Swedish to English is excellent -- not a hint of doubt about what words or phrases to use, and overall very good punctuation and other grammar, something which is sorely lacking in many published books.tory as much or even more than she does, she is the far more interesting character, so much so, that the book is titled for her.<br /><br />The translation from Swedish to English is excellent -- not a hint of doubt about what words or phrases to use, and overall very good punctuation and other grammar, something which is sorely lacking in many published books.

030758836X|3.0|Overall a real page-turner, I just didn't like the way it ended and hated the way the author pulled everything together. In the end, I looked back and thought, \\"What was the point of reading this whole thing?\\" I felt like the author was more interested, in the end, in making a commentary on our society and the relationships we form than providing the reader with a satisfying conclusion. If so, fine, but it left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Some of the questions the scenarios raise forces us to ask ourselves in a chilling moment:<br /><br />1. How much can I actually trust another human being?<br /><br />2. How far am I willing to go protect my image?<br /><br />3. How much will a person sacrifice to be happy?<br /><br />Unfortunately, if the author wanted me to care about finding these answers, she should have made the characters someone an average person can relate to. A sociopathic killer (not saying who that is) is not someone most people can relate to, however, understanding a bit of that person's mindset can beg the question, \\"How out of touch with reality our we?\\" Or perhaps even more disturbing, \\"How warped is the reality that our society has created through pop culture, media, and technology?\\"<br /><br />One of the things I did like was how every time someone in is a scenario they are uncomfortable with, they compare it to a movie or TV show, as though these forms of media have become the new \\"real.\\" Cops act like TV cops. Why? Because they grew up watching TV. It does force us to examine what influences the way we act, the way think, and the way we judge others.<br /><br />Overall, still did not love the ending. Came too much out of nowhere to really buy it. I would do 3.5 stars if possible, but felt 3 was more fitting to my experience than a 4.

Good songwriting keeps things fresh and some good guitar solos that remind me of an eariler time. The only thing that was questionable was the vocals. I know that screaming vocal is the metalcore thing, but if you listen to the songs, some of the yelps just don't fit. This guy can sing and he shows it off at times but feels he must scream on the last measure of each verse? I mean, at least take it easy on the ballads.<br /><br />Other than that, I like this CD.

Without Henrietta's personal story, the science could have been quite dry and, for me, would not have been nearly as engaging (not to mention heart-touching).<br /><br />Henrietta's story takes place before there were any laws or rules in place in the United States about taking and using tissue from a patient's body without informed consent. As a result, Henrietta didn't know that, while she was being treated for cervical cancer at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, samples of her cancer tissue were not only taken, but were eventually shared with other scientists all over the world. These tissues, dubbed HeLa after the first two letters of her first and last names, were instrumental in the development of a cure for polio and helped diagnose or recognize many other diseases, birth defects, etc.<br /><br />I learned that it was HeLa that helped recognize the birth defect that I was diagnosed with in the 60s, when I was a teenager. Henrietta died in 1951, the year before I was born. Children born with the same birth defect can now be diagnosed at birth and can be treated from a young age, which wasn't possible for me. It was things like this that made the story personal for me, including the fact that most of the book takes place only an hour or two away from where I have lived for the past 41 years, so the locations are familiar.<br /><br />Reading about how Henrietta was treated, how unethical researchers injected live cancer cells into living people \\"just to see what happened\\", and how some in the medical/scientific community got rich off of Henrietta's famous tissue when her family never got a dime can be difficult, even enraging. That said, it is important for us to know this history so that we can be vigilant and informed patients ourselves. Suffice it to say that you may never look at your doctor the same way again, and certainly you will not look at the field of medical research the same ever again.<br /><br />On top of an already impressive story, the author has provided several appendices at the end, including a glossary of all the characters mentioned in the book, a medical/research timeline, an alphabetical index and an extensive notes section in which she outlines her research for the book.<br /><br />The only negative I will mention, and perhaps this just hit me the wrong way and won't bother most people, is that Henrietta's daughter, Deborah, who appears in much of the last half of the book, is painted as a total lunatic. Whether she was really that nutty or not, I didn't think it was necessary to put so much detail of her crazy behavior in the book. This book, after all, is about Henrietta. Perhaps Ms. Skloot did it to show how upset the Lacks family was to discover what had happened with their mother's cells, and how everyone benefitted from them except for Henrietta's own family.<br /><br />Highly recommended. I would go so far as to say everyone should read this book.ves.

0385342063|5.0|I randomly grabbed this book at my local library and was hesitant to read it because I wasn't familiar with Sophie Kinsella, but I AM SO GLAD I DID! Once I started reading, I couldn't put the book down. It was soooo funny and had an interesting plot. I've never laughed so hard while reading a book. I totally fell in love with Kinsella's writing, so now I am reading all of her other novels!<br />This book is definitely a must read!!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this game is so addicting, i couldn't  take my eyes away. the only thing that got me was the battery usage. apple users, beware of your battery... kindle fire users, its okay for about, 47mins. too bad, the game is awesome enough to play all day! plug into your charger to litteraly play all day! totally addicting... but on the go, not so much.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|The game is always fun, challenging and frequently frustrating.  Strategy is a must especially in the higher levels.  I like it.
B008JH5CVS|4.0|I wasn't expecting much from this movie because I've been really disappointed with most of the new scifi movies and TV shows.  But I really enjoyed Lockout.  Overall I think it had the a great balance of action, drama, and romance for a science fiction movie.<br />My only complaint was about some of the scenes near the end of the movie which were annoyingly unrealistic.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Oh well, that will teach me, totally caught up in the hype. Didn't really do it for me but not my normal genre, should stick to what I know I like.

B003SHUMRI|3.0|it was good, but the sound quality wasn't very good and there was no option for close caption which would have helped a lot.
0307913090|2.0|I love this series but I personally can't stand listening to Roy Dotrice. He meanders on at a glacial pace and it seems to me that he's only got three different voices at his disposal. He uses his own voice for the POV characters, a voice that sounds old and fat for the non-POV guys, and a leprechaun impersonation for Tyrion. I'd skip the audiobooks for the actual books in this case.

B008JH5CVS|2.0|Okay, so I knew going into it that this was not going to be an Oscar contender. The premise is interesting (if familiar), but I like Guy Pearce and I like space movies. The trailers seemed kind of funny, and it was on sale, so I figured I'd take the chance. Unfortunately, by the time I got halfway through the movie, I wanted Maggie Grace's character to die. She is one of the most awful characters I've seen in a film in a long time. It was like she didn't want to be saved and valued her hair more than her life. I loathe this character, and she ruined the movie for me. If you like whiny, ridiculous, and illogical female leads, this movie is for you.

B000002P6R|4.0|This album is worth buying just to listen to John Entwistle rip through the blistering \\"The Quiet One\\" but a lot of folks would want to get it as the one that has \\"You Better You Bet\\". Both songs are great. This album as far as The Who go is one of the more pop oriented albums but that's not a bad thing. Pete Townshend really puts his heart and beliefs in all of it. It is a really good album. Enjoy.

B003F3FJQO|4.0|The second book in James Dashner's Maze Runner trilogy (I read the first, The Maze Runner, earlier this year) packed as much of a punch as its predecessor. Picking up where the first book left off, Thomas and his friends from The Glade have escaped the horrors of the maze and have been rescued by the folks from WICKED. Of course, nothing is quite as it seems, as the Gladers start to learn exactly what purpose they serve to WICKED. And they are faced with an even more dangerous challenge: surviving the Scorch Trials.<br /><br />This is a book about courage, faith, friendship, trust and confronting your fears. I'm deliberately obtuse in my description of the plot because I don't want to give anything away, and one of the great strengths of this book (in fact, the entire series to date) is that, much like the characters, you have no idea what to expect or what will happen next, and you don't even know if what happens is actually happening. I'm eagerly awaiting the release of the third and supposedly final book in the series later this fall, although I'll be faced with the inevitable battle between wanting to read it quickly and wanting to savor it, as I was with the Hunger Games and Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogies.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fascinating, action-packed and captivating book that keeps you guessing.

B004GUSG4M|4.0|Imagine waking up every morning and not knowing who or where you are. Every morning you are shocked to find out that you're in your mid-40s and married, but you don't recognize your husband or the house you're in. That is reality for Christine Lucas, the main character in S.J. Watson's Before I Go to Sleep. Suffering from memory problems as the result of head trauma, she lacks the ability to retain memories from one day to the next. She doesn't remember whether she loved her husband, she doesn't remember her friends or anything momentous in her life; each day she has to be reminded of everything that happened to her.<br /><br />One day Christine meets Dr. Ed Nash, a neurologist interested in her case. He encourages her to keep a journal about what she remembers each day, and then he calls her each day to remind her where she can find her journal. He also takes her to places he hopes might trigger her memories, and little by little, they start coming back--and Christine realizes that regaining her memories opens her up to the realities of how she was injured and what her life was like before she lost her memory. Much of the book is composed of accounts from her journal, as her memories--or what she thinks are memories--start coming back, and she doesn't know who to trust.<br /><br />This was a really interesting concept, similar to movies like Memento and 50 First Dates. There were a lot of twists and turns in the story which kept me guessing, and many of my suspicions about where the story would go were proven wrong. Ultimately, however, despite the inherent tragedy of Christine's story, I didn't find any of the characters particularly sympathetic, so I couldn't get myself fully immersed in their lives. But if you enjoy fast-paced mystery/thrillers, you'll enjoy this.
B006W0QR1S|5.0|Atmospheric. The movie is atmospheric like no other. From the '80s electro soundtrack, to the beautifully shot night driving sequences, to Ryan Gosling's nearly-wordless, masterful portrayal of a stunt driver who gets caught in a slow-burn escalation to the extreme, the movie elements are seamlessly combined to take the viewer on a harmonic drive into the sublime. A true work of art that demands to be re-viewed and re-discovered.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Given Stephen King's penchant for 1000+-page novels, it was terrific to have a short story from him instead. Mile 81 is a short story released exclusively in e-book form, and it marks a return to the King of yesteryear, where \\"regular\\" people find themselves confronted with a completely horrifying situation.<br /><br />At Mile 81 on the Maine Turnpike is a boarded-up rest stop. One day, young Pete Simmons goes exploring there, to prove to his older brother and his friends that he's just as capable of being adventurous as they are. Armed with the magnifying glass he got for his 10th birthday, he finds the rest stop not quite all it's cracked up to be--just a place where teenagers go to drink, play cards and hook up. But then he finds a bottle of vodka, and drinks just enough to pass out. While he is sleeping, a mud-covered station wagon drives up to the rest stop (strange because it hasn't rained in Maine for more than a week) and stops. The doors open, yet no one seems to get out. Then the car's presence starts to attract a number of good samaritans driving along the highway, who don't realize quite where their good intentions will lead them...<br /><br />This was an enjoyable short story, and it really did remind me of King's earlier work. As always, King excels at characterization, and really imbues each character with a great deal of life and detail in just a few pages. The problem is the story just wasn't as scary as I had hoped, and I felt like the ending was a little too pat.
B0086700CM|2.0|Great graphics but just to hard for this old Grandma. it would be perfect if the speed would build up and not start out so fast. My Grandson loves it however.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I've read a great deal of so-called young adult (YA) fiction over the last few years, and as I've remarked previously, a great deal of it deals with dystopian visions of the future, or relationships with vampires, werewolves, zombies or other demon hunters. While Jay Asher's excellent Thirteen Reasons Why takes place in the present day, it also paints a bleak yet hopeful picture, but from a completely different perspective.<br /><br />Clay Jensen is a studious and well-liked high school student, who returns home one day to find a shoebox of cassette tapes on his doorstep, mailed with no return address. As he starts listening to the first tape, he discovers they were recorded by his classmate (on whom he had a crush), Hannah Baker, who committed suicide two weeks earlier. On the tapes, Hannah gives 13 reasons why she took her life, reasons she attributes to 13 different people, and she explains each in detail. Clay doesn't understand why he is on this list, and he is tremendously affected by what Hannah has to say, and by the actions that drove her to suicide.<br /><br />This is a beautifully written and emotionally powerful book, which thankfully has proven popular among middle school and high school students, as I believe it sends some very important messages about suicide without being heavy-handed or preachy. You never know how your actions, which may seem utterly harmless, may affect another. While at times I felt somewhat frustrated by Hannah's anger, I realized that when a person is driven to suicide, they are not thinking rationally, and aren't willing to let people in to help them. This book is a bit depressing given the subject matter, but it also sounds a hopeful tone near the end, one which I hope all readers hear. A quick and affecting read, but not a light one.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really fun and keeps you busy and works on your concentration me and my brother love it. I think everyone should buy this.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Magical. Incredibly compelling. Romantic. Boy, I loved this book.<br /><br />Erin Morgenstern's debut novel follows the magical Cirque des Rêves, a circus full of dazzling and fantastical amazements. Marco and Celia, two brilliant magicians, are locked in a competition that neither of them understand, and that only one of them can survive. They use the circus as the epicenter of this competition, creating spectacles more incredible than the next. And as the two fall deeper in love, they learn just how enmeshed with the circus their lives are--and how the lives of all of those involved will be affected by whatever decisions they make regarding their future.<br /><br />I thought this was a terrific book. I was completely taken with Morgenstern's creation of the circus and all of the people involved, both behind the scenes and within it. And this is a circus like no other. Don't think this is a story about clowns and lion tamers and trapeze artists--this is a story with a strong emphasis on magic and illusion and manipulation of reality. I fell in love with the characters and was truly disappointed when I was finished, although I couldn't help but race through the story. I'm sure this will be made into a movie at some point, but I'd encourage you to read the book first. If you enjoy these types of stories, you'll fall in love with the book just like I did.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Love the game, truly addicting! I is true that spider reactions are based on your moves ( Helloooo, it's a puzzle game) but that doesn't make it stupid in my opinion.<br /><br />The only thing I would change is the 1hint/day rule, on the paid version at least. Maybe cut the wait time in half for the next clue,  because if I'm really stumped and don't have access to a hint after using up the daily one 8 levels ago, I'm going to have to put the game down and get some actual work some.

B0076NKNLA|5.0|It's a great story, and it delivers some especially wonderful moments along with its insights into the real Marilyn Monroe. Her life as a famous icon had this unseen insecurity that really left Marilyn a \\"candle in the wind\\". But this movie finds the other side of that unpredictability - all the fun and the humor when hurricane Marilyn finally blows in to town on an old TWA aircraft. It reminded me of \\"My Favorite Year,\\" as a kind of love letter to a specific memory about one magical moment in time.<br /><br />At first you're just rooting for 22-year-old Clark, who wants his first job in the motion picture industry. (His British parents don't approve.) He soon navigates his way onto Laurence Olivier's 1957 movie \\"The Prince and the Showgirl,\\" and as \\"third assistant director\\" he's basically just a personal assistant. He's eventually assigned some errands with Marilyn Monroe, who connects with him during emotional moments in her own life.<br /><br />It's fun to watch the daily life on the set of a movie, which establishes the characters who will be affected when the legend arrives. Everyone wanted the favor of Marilyn Monroe, of course, but the movie shows that behind-the-scenes, she was deeply insecure about her performance in the film. There's scenes where the crew reacts as she continues to arrive late for the filming, along with a \\"method acting\\" coach who brings her own unwanted input for the director. The film is set just as Marilyn was starting that exhilarating transformation into a superstar, and she'd also just started her marriage to playwright Arthur Miller. (It's after a turbulent fight that she first turns to Clark...)<br /><br />The character of Laurence Oliver hints that Marilyn knows exactly what she's doing, saying respectfully that you don't survive in Hollywood without being clever. There's a subplot which kind of gets lost, about how Olivier himself was hoping this Marilyn film would re-vitalize himself (to the dismay of his wife, Vivian Leigh). But I thought it was touching the way the script gives him a final scene when he's watching the finished footage of their film. It's like the script-writers inserted a special line of appreciation of the whole film industry, acknowledging this family of artists who magically leave behind this legacy of characters on the screen...<br /><br />Towards the end, in a voice-over, an older Clark thanks Marilyn for the joy that she brought to the world. And I think that's the best thing about the movie - that while it depicts Marilyn honestly, with all the benefit of our modern hindsight, it also captures her at her very best. There's the giddy moments when she's the ultimate dream come to for a 22-year-old. (What if you could show up at your old high school with Marilyn Monroe on your arm?)<br /><br />And there's the occasional line of tender advice from the chorus of older actors and other stunned onlookers onlookers around them. But it all builds to a moment, and a crossroads for Monroe herself. I thought Michelle Williams really brought the story to life, so I was glad that I finally watched this. It is a very good story, and the movie has some very entertaining scenes.But I thought it was touching the way the script gives him a final scene when he's watching the finished footage of their film.

B0083GQKQG|4.0|This film is actually a 3.5 star rating. However, I found somewhat creative in a different aspect of most films, giving it the extra 1/2 star. The symbolism of the color \\"red\\" was slightly overdone. This is a story (I didn't read the book) which could lead to several controversial subjects. From the beginning it's apparent a major tragedy has occurred in the mother's \\"Eva\\" (Swinton) family/life.  The movie changes scenes from the present to past events.  This may be a \\"SPOILER,\\" however I believe most know early on Eva's son was involved and her husband and dtg were victims. Eva has a son, \\"Kevin.\\" Early, it's apparent Kevin isn't ordinary. He's highly intelligent. Is he a sociopath, a child needing strict discipline, or just evil? IMO, this is where the film goes too far. Even if he had no conscience, a 4-5 yr. old child can't rationalize a \\"plan\\" to fool a father who's a M.D., a published mother, albeit very unsure of herself. I found the main question to be, how far does a mother's love extend? The acting is very good. I want to read the book. As this is a movie of complex emotions and undertones I find would be nearly impossible for a viewer to understand what the writer intended. Personally, one comment from Kevin in prison made an impact. Telling his mother the majority end up \\"watching TV at night. It's progressed to half of the people inside the TV are watching TV. What are they watching? Someone like me.\\" Definitely, \\"food for thought.\\" Overall, the movie was avg to good. However, when the finale scene occurred, I felt somewhat cheated. However, the movie really isn't about the finale.  It's about what/why events leading to the finale occurred. Questions concerning nature/nurture vs. environment, unconditional love, etc. It was dark. Yet, almost exhausting watching Eva (nearly robotic) carry on ADL, when her life seemed hopeless, alone, displaced anger from neighbors, etc.

0307949486|3.0|In \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" the mystery was interesting, however, the characters themselves were not very well done. When listening to \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" I was split. I was very interested in the mystery-- what happened to Harriet?-- and was very engaged in those sections. However, once the mystery was solved, I lost interest though the book continued (for far, far longer than it should have). I was also disinterested in the parts focusing on the characters rather than the plot. The characters just were not very well developed. Lisbeth shows some promise as an interesting character, yet is too underdeveloped to tell if she will be able to live up to that promise. Hopefully she will be filled out further as the books continue. Blomvist was even less developed as a character. One gets very little feel for him when reading the story. They see his actions, but not his personality. I am also generally bored to tears of male protagonists who for some uncanny reason, all the female characters in the book want to (and do) sleep with. It seems so James Bond male-fantasy that may be appealing to some readers (and perhaps the author), but it adds nothing to the character, nor the story.<br />On the whole I was very interested in the mystery of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" but found the characters themselves severly lacking. Hopefully Larsson will be able to fill them out more in the second and third books.

B008QE9XD2|4.0|Tim Burton's twisted reimaging of Dark Shadows is not for everyone - An open mind is a must for this film. It isn't an outright comedy, but it does have fun with the melodrama and stiff style of the original 1960s TV series. Johnny Depp is creepily perfect as the vampire Barnabas, and the rest of the cast is equally good - The stylish visuals are spectacular, the plot is convoluted and perhaps a bit unfocused, but there is obvious love for the source material in Burton's work. The nay-sayers may have cried foul over the film's outrageous approach, but Tim Burton's signature style is a perfect match for the Gothic weirdness of this classic saga. I would have given the film five stars, but a couple of needlessly tacky sexual jokes lowered the tone just a bit - Even so, four strong stars for this off-beat tale of an 18th Century vampire in the modern world.<br /><br />P.S., If you like this adaptation, don't miss the original 1971 film version, \\"House of Dark Shadows\\"<br />[[ASIN:B008JL8NQ0 House of Dark Shadows]]

0345803485|2.0|It is beyond me why this book has done so well. There was no romance, only exotic scenes.<br />Unbelievable young hero with vague job description.

0763652245|5.0|We originally found this book at the library.  Knowing our two year old's attention span limits, we typically do not buy many books since today's favorite quickly becomes forgotten.  This one however was easy for him to follow along with and he wanted to read it every night.  Several months later, he still often picks this book out to read before bed.  The color is very vibrant and the story simple so it is easy for him to follow along with.  It also helps us teach him that you have to be gentle since if you turn things too fast, some the flaps will rip.
030758836X|3.0|For the most part, I enjoyed this book.  I found it interesting that I couldn't decide which character I was rooting for (at least until the half-way mark).  The ending is atrocious; however, and I can only hope that the author is planning a sequel with a great revenge plot.  SPOILER ALERT:  There is no way anyone should be able to get away with the murder that happened in this book.  I'm almost embarrassed for the author if she doesn't come out with a sequel.

I am looking forward to reading the second book.  I was not a fan of the twilight books, but this book seems much more mature and thoughtful.  It gave me the feeling I had after reading the first of the Harry Potter books.

B003EYVXXW|1.0|If this type of propganadistic, wind-up, full strength punch to the solar plexus has been tried on any other religion, this film would have been absolutely shredded by defamation groups. The violins would have come out, minorities would have held tearful candlelit vigils outside movie theatres, the film would have been banned and the director would have been forced into Hollywood exile.<br /><br />As it turns out, the punch went to the solar-plexus of Christianity, which meant a few Catholic feathers were ruffled, and everyone apart from evangelistic atheists and myself fell alseep mid-way through the movie. While it is, of course, unacceptable to denigrate, insult and marginalise any world religion, Christianity inexplicably enjoys exemption from this rule.<br /><br />That's not saying that individuals acting in the name of Christianity have not done some dreadful things - there is no question of this. They destroyed the cultures of meso-America as best they could, they attempted the same in South America, they conducted the inquisition and they burned thousands of innocent women alive at the stake. The list is long and various legitimate films could have been made based on these events.<br /><br />What they dind't do is single-handedly destroy the library at Alexandria. At worst Christians acting under the edict of Theodosius are thought to have destroyed pagan religious artifacts once the library had already been burned down in 48BC and then looted during an attack by the Emperor Aurelian on the city of Alexandria in the 3rd century BC.<br /><br />Naturally, you wouldn't realise this watching the movie, which makes it appear as Theodosious single handedly and deliberately destroyed the world's ancient teachings in the name of Christianity. If this type of allegation had been  made against a living person it would have resulted in a fairly meaty libel case, but since Alejandro Amenábar's adversaries can't speak for themselves by dint of being dead, he gets to grind his axe against Christianity without any interference.<br /><br />The result is that Amenabar gets to:<br />1. Falsely portray the destruction of the literary contents of the library as a Christian act<br />2. Falsely portray the murder of Hypatia as a Christian act (it is only known that she was murdered by a mob)<br /><br />In amongst all this you have a love story that doesn't quite work, lots of hacking people to bits and Hypatia being falsely credited with finding a scientific rational for the heliocentric view of the universe.<br /><br />In other words, what you have is a work of anti-Christian fiction loosely based on historical events and personalities.<br /><br />The film we'll never see is how direct anti-Christian policies in the gloriously atheistic Soviet Union led to some of the worst atrocities in modern history - for instance the boiling alive of the Bishop of Voronezh in a cauldron of boiling tar (just one of the 20 odd million unluckly eggs that were broken in the making of the delectable socialist omelette of the Soviet Union). And that's a pity, because unlike Agora, it would not only make interesting viewing, but actually be based on historic fact.

B001GCUO5M|4.0|Leonardo DiCaprio plays a U.S. Marshall called on to investigate the escape and disappearance of a patient from the Civil War island fortress which serves as an institute for the treatment of the criminally insane.  Set in the gray cold war year of 1954, DiCaprio's Marshall finds himself immediately enmeshed in a Kafkaesque maze presided over by the aloof chief psychiatrist played by Ben Kingsley.  As if being trapped on an island insane asylum accessible only by ferry in the midst of a terrible storm is not enough to face, the Marshall is also plagued by his own personal demons.  His dreams are marked by the beseeching eyes and voices of the dead, from his late wife (played hauntingly by Michelle Williams) to the inhabitants of the Nazi concentration camp at Dachau that he had encountered as an American soldier at the end of World War II.  The troubled and numerous dreams of the protagonist cause the audience to wonder which events correspond to reality and which exist only in his own mind--to the point where the movie becomes something other than a classic thriller.  The viewer is less inclined to sit on the edge of his seat if that which the protagonist encounters may be only his own dark thoughts.

0385341008|5.0|I often get asked about the best book I've read lately, this summer, this year--this book fits all those categories!  I absolutely loved it.  It captured me from the very first page and never let me go.<br /><br />The entire book is written in the format of a series of letters (how very Jane Austen!) but was written about the World War II time period.  Juliet is a writer who is looking for her next subject when she receives a random letter in the mail from a man in Guernsey who found one of her books.  He asks her for a simple favor and a long correspondence springs up between them.  Juliet is smitten with the story of the German occupation of this small island and the delightful people who endured through the war.<br /><br />The books was so charming, so witty, so packed with the full range of what makes humanity so utterly delightful.  The sense of humor and warmth of the authors was woven into a masterful writing style and a beautifully crafted story that made for an incredible read!
B00065MDRW|5.0|I have had several versions of this album released in 1969. 2 vinyl copies, one 8-track (yes this dates me, and I don't care), cassette (my 2 year old loved to pull the tape out of the cartriges in spagetti heaps all over the living room)....and finally, (woo hoo) the CD. Why I didn't upgrade to this at least 20 years ago is beyond me, however, having seen Greg Lake recently on his \\"Songs Of A Lifetime\\" tour in which he played most of this albuim, put me in mind..<br />it is an epic, for sure, in a time when music really was for its own sake and not merely to score a 'hit'. That says much about this and many other recordings during this period, and it is by no means a hard listen.<br />The telling point is that many years later, this album is still hailed as a desired classic, which only proves how it has stood he test of time. For any progressive Rock fans, and thanks in part to the hot Steampunk genre, giving new blood to the old prog rock scene, it may just be worth ones while to have a great album in their library, this is a must have. Great place to begin as any I say:)

B006WAIUEK|4.0|The Skagboys is similar to Porno in that we learn more about just how sick Sickboy is, and we learn a little bit more about how nice Spud is. What I find most interesting in this novel is that Renton is more selfish and less likeable than in Trainspotting, and Porno, so art is mimicking life - often people in their late teens and early twenties are nasty little buggers who think they know it all and take everyone for granted. Begbie is still as violent as he is in the other two novels but there are fewer chapters narrated by him.<br /><br />The Skagboys is a good read, and is difficult to put down, the plot is more linear than Trainspotting; however, it is let down by a few scenes where Welsh jumps the shark, e.g. a foetus thrown down a rubbish chute, and a 16 year old raped by the man who killed her father. These scenes and one or two others, though shocking and disgusting, seem to be for the benefit of middle class readers' dark fantasies about how depraved the underclasses are, and they undermine the overall tone of the novel.

0307949486|5.0|\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" by Stieg Larsson caught my attention because of all the controversy that followed the Swedish version of the movie, which came out sometime in 2000s.  The main character is a young female computer hacker.  Her looks completely defy standards of dress code and looks of someone who works for a private investigator firm.  Her current assignment is to collect information on a journalist, who believes bringing truth to people matters more than his own personal well being, and for this he gets to go to jail for 3 months.<br /><br />The story begins with the description of an old man, who has been receiving framed flowers as a gift from a unanimous person for many years.  It sets the mood for a great story, which does not relieve what is going on until almost the end of the story, keeping you guessing and intrigued.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander, who is said to be socially incompetent due to rough childhood, and many other reasons, gets hired by Dragan Armansky to file paperwork in his office, and just make copies of things.  That is until he discovers that she has a special talent for getting just the right information, and making reports about people so accurate, that he is just in shock how someone who is deemed to be socially awkward would ever be able to produce this kind of information.  Lisbeth is under care of a social worker who takes advantage of her situation by forcing her to perform sexual favors for him in order to get her money, for which the government and the court made him responsible.  One day he takes it too far with her, and she repays him with a visit, which he will never forget.<br /><br />Carl Mikael Blomkvist is the journalist who writes for a small magazine company called \\"The Millenium\\" and has just been convicted of libeling a financier and is facing a fine and three months in jail.  Henrick Vanger hires Armansky's company to conduct thorough investigation of Mickael, which is performed by Lisbeth.  Michael is then hired by Henrick to figure out what exactly happened to his niece nearly 50 years prior.  Since Mickael is an investigative journalist, he takes on this task, which, although sounds absolutely absurd, gives him something to do, since he just fired himself from the Millennium, as well as it pays him an obsene amount of money, which he would then be able to use for the magazine.  Henrick also entices him by having information on the businessman about whom Mickael wrote the story which landed him in jail.<br /><br />Mickael starts his research, finds out about Lisbeth, they start working together.  As expected, the plot thickens, and it becomes a very interesting story, to the point, where you just do not want to put the book down, because you want to know what will happen next.  The book is not filled with useless details.  It includes just the right amount of information to keep you interested, but not to push you away by losing your attention with saying too much of irrelevant information.  Some of the details are a bit racy, but not as descriptive as they are in a movie.  It ties in explanation of who, what, when, and for what reason, as well as romance, intriguing situations, acts that would seem immoral to some, and acceptable to others.<br /><br />Stieg Larsson wrote the trilogy of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" before he passed away.  The entire trilogy was great, although the last book started to drag a little bit, was filled with too many details, and was starting to be a little boring at parts.  The first book gained great interest in Europe, as well as the US, and until this day you can see people reading it everywhere.  I have not heard a bad review of it yet.

B005IQZB14|4.0|Cheryl Strayed is an anti-hero, a deeply flawed individual who found something within herself that drove her to keep walking step after step on an improbable journey. I admire her blunt honesty about her own issues. She doesn't puff herself up about what she accomplished on the Pacific Crest Trail. Instead, she admits all the careless mistakes she made, and \\"Wild\\" is almost a cautionary tale: \\"Don't do what I did.\\" For those who like a crisp, competently written survivor story that doesn't sugarcoat, this is a good choice. It's palatable to men as well as women, outdoors-types as well as city dwellers.

B000E1MXSW|4.0|This movie is the true life story of a young lady who went into a convent before WWII in Europe. I am not a Catholic, and have had many questions about Nuns, their motivation for becoming, and staying, a \\"Bride of Christ.\\" This film not only answered my questions, but it was also entertaining, and a wonderful human interest story. I only wish that her life had taken a different path when she was faced with the Nazis, but you'll have to watch it to see what I mean. Good purchase, to watch time and time again, because it takes several viewings to get the jest of the entire film.

B005DR64OQ|1.0|The \\"a\\" in Trespass needs to be replaced with an \\"i,\\" and then you have a safely accurate description of this movie.  I used to say a movie I hated was the worst one I've ever seen, only to be surprised by something even worse.  On that premise, the only thing I can safely assure you of is that this is a top contender for biggest stinker of all time if not the ultimate one.<br /><br />Another thing I would like to point out is that I was never interested in seeing this movie because Nicole \\"Ice Queen\\" Kidman and Nicholas \\"Ought to be locked in a\\" Cage are known for their ingenious knack of being in stinkers.  Well, combine the two with a cast of inept robbers who act as bad as most of the cast in Malevolence, and you get yourself one toxic waste of a stench that would make you want to clear the room if not for the stop button.  The only good thing I can say about this movie is I didn't choose to watch it.  Unfortunately, Sweetie Pie Dearest realized his blunder in choice less than half-way through, and I made the choice to finish watching it, truly amazed at how bad it was.  How much worse was it going to get?  LOTS!<br /><br />The robbers were stupid, the dumbest one being the guy who had the hots for Nicole. Guess his freezer was broke and he needed something frigid to rest his beer on.  Cage's character was the worst, his character doing the most nonsensical things witnessed on film in a long time.  No matter what this idiot gets threatened with, no matter how much violence and bad language ensue, he refuses to give up any money.  If he'd have given the creeps anything at all right away, we wouldn't have had 90 minutes of bad over-acting and the world's most pointless plot.  No, he won't do it, so we have to watch the worst character of all outdo Cage's awful delivery running around strung out in a purple dress and torturing a young girl.  In fact, the only character with any brains in this movie was the daughter.<br /><br />I'm so angry with myself for choosing to finish this horrible flick that I can't even bear to get into the absurdities of a guy with a gun, a needle, a wife rape, removing a daughter's kidney, and a kook obsessed with the Ice Queen staring him in the face being uncooperative at every turn, so all I can say is if you still think this movie sounds appealing, you are more easily entertained than a little kid watching Teletubbies.  It's on almost the same level, except Teletubbies has less foul language, makes more sense, and isn't an insult to the human race regardless of age.to finish this horrible flick that I can't even bear to get into the absurdities of a guy with a gun, a needle, a wife rape, removing a daughter's kidney, and a kook obsessed with the Ice Queen staring him in the face being uncooperative at every turn, so all I can say is if you still think this movie sounds appealing, you are more easily entertained than a little kid watching Teletubbies.

0007477155|1.0|Great series if you know all you're getting is the first five books, but books six and seven don't exist yet, so there is no way this product should have the words \\"complete box set of all 7 books\\" in its title.  Since there are seven books planned, this seems to me clearly a deliberate attempt to deceive people who haven't gone to the author's web page into thinking they're getting the whole series.  I'm the third review to point this out, and I wish Amazon would take down products that its reviewers identify as scams.  Also, the term is \\"boxed set,\\" not \\"box set.\\"  That would mean you were selling seven boxes.
B0083GCK5G|2.0|Very disapppointed. Did not bring me the energy that the early Beach Boy's songs did. Wouldn't even recommed it for free.
B000SGRONM|4.0|Buy this book -- a paperback copy is good, not a Kindle version -- and put it with your Christmas/Holiday stuff. Just store it in the boxes along with your tree stand (not to be confused with your deer hunting tree stand...), Christmas balls (don't confuse those either), family recipes and homemade ornaments. Then pull Holidays on Ice out each year and read it during the holidays. Preferably with a stiff drink in your hand. Add a rosemary sprig with a few speared cranberries to whatever you're drinking if you want to really get festive about it. The stories are short, quick, and highly enjoyable (TWSS). I swear it's been a holiday tradition of mine for years. Happy Holiday Reading!

0764207407|5.0|I own both Insight Editions of \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" and \\"Sense & Sensibility\\" and I only wish they had continued this series to include all of Jane Austen's major novels - Northanger Abbey, Mansfield Park, and Persuasion. The notes in the margins provide historical context, insights into Jane Austen's own life, and chatty asides from the editor that make you feel like you're reading the book along with an intelligent friend or book club.

It is an accessible edition of the book - less academic than the Norton Critical Edition, without compromising the experience of just reading Austen's books for fun.

0679809015|5.0|This is a good and colorful book for young children. my only problem with it was that it was a small book, I thought it was bigger.. My almost 3 year old loved it and went through the book and told us which animal was the daddy, mommy, and baby.. She loves it and we read it or she does every night before bed and loves to look at it during quite time.. It also makes a good book for on a trip to town to entertain her will in the car..
0062197258|5.0|This book drew me in from Chapter one and didn't let me go until I finished.  I have ADD- but this book was so good that I actually read for hours at a time.  If you love mystery and edge of your seat thrillers, don't let this one go!!!
B004EQAVHI|5.0|This is not a romance or horror film but there are elements of both. This film resonates into your mind, your spirit and your soul.  This story follows three children who are slated for a doomed adulthood.  The music, pacing, colors, costumes and casting, in particular Carrie M are spot on.  This film will haunt you, tears will flow, your chest will ache.  If you are the type who is looking for \\"more\\" from cinema, I highly recommend this.  If you are the type who doesn't like to feel a bit of heartache, who prefers to be entertained or who will be on and off your cell phone, don't watch this - you won't get it and will think the film is bad - it is a very well done film, just not for everyone.

0434020362|3.0|We all have our little habits, some of them most likely of the bad kind, and those are the ones we strive to overcome. If only it would be that simple. In his book The Power Of Habit Charles Duhigg approaches the subject of what habits are and how we can ultimately change them.<br />Written in an engaging style, with just the right balance of scientific fact and actual examples, you can tell straight away that the author has a journalistic background. This certainly pays off and pulled me right into this fascinating field of social sciences, or more precisely, human behavior.<br />As much as I enjoyed the first few chapters, it soon became clear that despite the different case studies of individuals, organizations, as well as societies, the core of each chapter was repeating itself over and over again, ultimately becoming redundant. The underlying message that habits cannot be eradicated, but must instead be replaced, and the connection between \\"cue\\", \\"routine\\" and \\"reward\\" haven't just been presented once or twice, but countless times, culminating in a guide to using the ideas presented in the book. You could practically skip the actual book and still get the gist by reading the appendix alone. As much as the narrative swept me along and the deliberations proved to be insightful, I felt that the book in its entirety has been unnecessarily blown up by its length.<br />In short: Interesting yet repetitive study on habits and how to change them!<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Random House. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.

If you think Gattaca or Solaris is too slow, too dry, too mushy, or intellectual, then this one's not for you. Now -if you would enjoy some sit back and enjoy and take it in kind of sci-fi, with a twist to it that's a little more humor, a little more thoughtful, then you'll love this one. One of my favorites of all time.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|I had not read a King novel in probably over 20 years (The Stand, Christine, Cujo...). King has a way of just taking things out of thin air, enjoying the thing he whips out, but lacking the explaining that a writer might use to help with the suspension of disbelief. This novel was different. Still King, but easy to get into and enjoy, along with that suspension of disbelief. It's a long one, and is not scientific, and has no techno-babble, but it does great on the basis of the characters, and the ideas, rules of time travel in the story, and the plot. Excellent. Have already recommended it to my co-workers. If you liked \\"The Time Travelers Wife\\" I believe you'll very likely like \\"11/22/63\\". If you expect a Michael Crichton novel, this is not what your looking for. Highly recommended. Excellent.

I was looking forward to reading his latest work, \\"Canada\\", after hearing an interview with him on Diane Rheems show.<br />All I can say is he didn't disappoint me with this book. The plot is certainly novel(ha ha) and his insight into human nature is uncanny.<br />It is a fairly quick, entertaining and thought provoking book. I don't usually underline things in a novel, but there are several lines here that were worth remembering and quoting.

B007PVHANM|5.0|NOBODY can say one bad thing about this film. BOB MARLEY is the KING of all artists. This movie shows that he was never motivated by money. All he ever wanted was; \\"for MANKIND to live as ONE....black, white, Chinese,\\"<br /><br />Marley did not measure wealth by stuff, and bank accounts..he measured it by \\"LIFE\\".<br /><br />People would come to 56 HOPE ROAD asking for money for dem pickney, medical bills, food, rent...and BOB stood there and gladly handed out his earnings....he did not \\"dweet, for tax deductions, he did it because he never forgot his roots.<br /><br />This movie is a MUST HAVE. I would give it 10 STARS, but 5 was the limit.<br /><br />\\"HAILE SELASSIE IS THE CHAPEL\\", is the tune the movie ends with....wait and see. I do not want to ruin it for those who have yet to see it. One love and more LIFE ~
B00846TRHY|4.0|Here's a movie I wanted to see from the first time I heard about it. Had made plans to see this in theaters when it was released last fall. It's opening was dwarfed by the simaltaneous opening of Christian movie juggernaut Courageous. Plus, it's limited release meant only major cities even had the film playing. Plans fell through with a buddy of mine for going downtown (Chicago) to see it, so I decided to wait for the dvd. March came, and I prepaid for the expected June release date. Now, here it is August, and I'm just now watching Machine Gun Preacher. And for me, my mixed journey to watch out seems somewhat reflective of the movie itself.<br /><br />For starters, it's a story quickly told. If you watch the preview, you've basically seen the movie. Beyond that, I must say it's not a movie you \\"like.\\" It's a movie about real life: with parts that tug on your heart with their life-likeness; others that bewonder you with their clicheness; and of course a few that inspire you with their true story-telling, even if they were done Hollywood.<br /><br />I don't think this movie is for everyone. The elements of the story seem all too familiar for jaded Western viewing: African orphans, poverty, sole American hero. Even some parts of the story can seem repetitive. But you know what, life can be repetitive. Life can also be inspiring and cliche and heart-tugging. So for that, I applaud Machine Gun Preacher; it really is lifelike.<br /><br />The real meat of the movie lies in the character development of Sam. His metamorphasis is brilliant. We watch him go from ruthless sinner to saint to near insanity, as he becomes gripped by his cause. I wouldn't have made all the choices Sam did, but then again, thousands of orphans in Africa wouldn't be alive today if Sam acted like I would have. And herein is the beauty of Machine Gun Preacher. It tells its story as it happened: good, bad, and ugly. In that right, it reminds me of an Old Testament account, like that of David or Abraham or Jacob. These men did amazing things for the Kingdom of God and for the communities around them, and yet they have bad marks on their records; they weren't perfect, and the Bible lets us know that. It tells their stories as they happened: good, bad, and ugly...cliche, inspiring, and emotional. Because life is like that. One minute things  are all too familiar with monotony and routine and the next minute everything is different; and even if that same thing has happened to everyone you know, it's new to you because it's the first time it has happened to you. So life can be cliche and yet heart-tugging at the same time. And so can Machine Gun Preacher.<br /><br />Asthetically, Gerard Butler is clearly the star, and he does a fine job acting. Other notables include: the one little kid with the scar on his face and Gerard's wife. Most of the other character seemed pretty stock for the roles they had to play, and though they did them relatively well, there is nothing worth mentioning. Good cinematography and great musical score too (check out Revival by Soulsavers). The first twenty minutes or so has some rough scenes, so be forewarned. Also, there are several violent scenes showing the African warzones and its victims throughout the film. Nothing is gratuitous though some of it is very graphic.<br /><br />Best line in the movie is when Sam, the main character, reflects on the violence and suffering in Sudan: \\"I'm scared that one day I'll close my eyes to all this and make it somebody else's problem.\\"<br /><br />All in all, the film is worth one watch; not a lot of replay value, perhaps a second and third viewing only to fully appreciate the character development (or to keep your heart stirred if you're wired that way).<br /><br />4 out 5.or Jacob.

0143038419|4.0|I feel it's not just my responsibility, but my duty to respond to the negative reviews that have cropped up on Goodreads and elsewhere like sand in the desert. Many reviewers have mentioned EAT, PRAY, LOVE as being self-indulgent. I'm sorry but writing is always going to be self-indulgent, as it gives the writer the ability to work out his or her problems, demons, doubts, and fears. Beyond that, it gives the writer, who does it well, the opportunity to reach beyond friends and family and actually develop an audience and a following.<br /><br />In the case of Ms.Gilbert, she's not the only one who walked away from a troubled marriage, and she offers a sense of hope to the reader. Sure, it's all about her, but it was written in the first person, and it is a memoir after all. Success brings with it a number of detractors, the way palmetto bugs have taken over Florida, and that's fine. I'm sure she's accepted her fate, along with the big, fat paycheck that goes along with it. But I've decided to celebrate her memoir for what it is, and if the reader simply focuses on that aspect, it's a well-written read, a journey in self-discovery, and it provides the reader hope. And hope is a beautiful thing.<br /><br />I tip my hat to Ms. Gilbert and her well-earned success. This fact alone tells me that her story was the right piece written at the right time, that tells me it was lucky, but there was also a connection established between writer and reader, as her individualistic journey is a story many can relate to, especially since our country has built itself around individualism. Though she didn't necessarily set out to write this book, and was merely looking for a way to find herself again, she has accomplished both, and I might add rather admirably. I can't think of too many people who would turn down the opportunity she was presented with. Most important of all, though, is that she came out a better, stronger, more rounded person on the other side, and I believe that's one journey we should all strive for.<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigatorjourney we should all strive for.<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigator
B002ZG9800|5.0|One of Jim Carrey's best movies.  I thought the story was well done and I was thrilled to find out that the real Phillip Morris was at the premier when the movie came out in the theaters.  I'm really glad I bought this movie.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|First I want to point out that I have not finished the book. I goto the section recommending to take the test. Honestly I think the book is more of a suppliment to the test. Taking an assessment type test will help to determine your strengths more than a book that would be keen to generalize the information for all and doesn't allow for natural responses. You would be keen to review each one and think about each. The test gives you a time limit to answer the question ( I didn't find trouble to think for a few secs ) which best describes you. Now the WOW part of this is with the results. You get the Top 5. And honestly that's all you really need. Gives you a minimal amount out of 34 to focus your attention on. Would I want to put my limited energy in excelling in 5 or spreading it out over 34 minimally? I chose 5. I started the next part of reviewing my results and it's so amazing how accurate it is! At first I seen the description of the theme and thought to myself, \\"Not sure about a few of them.\\" But they give you a mini-book in pdf format that explains each and I have to say I was smiling BIG on each description. I had laughed (joy) at a few of them, b/c they were so true describing things or behaviors that I knew I was doing, but probably been doing for my whole life that I needed a systematic assessment to tell me. Hard for some people to find what they are good at from a 1st perspective b/c you naturally do them so they are not always that obvious to you. My wife had to check on me b/c I was laughing and yelling out loud \\"That is so true\\", \\"What?! That is so right!\\". It just feels good when you have been spending time trying to figure out what you really want to do with your life and what you are good at that will help get those results FAST.

B002N5N4M6|4.0|I love TBBT - finally a TV show I can relate to, Sheldon reminds me of me - minus the scientific genius part - my one complaint is that they don't appear to be the full episodes as advertised - they appear to be the edited Syndicated versions of the show - for example, in the season finale of season three, when Howard and Raj are signing up Sheldon for the dating service, in the original episode there is a scene of them filling out the application form by answering the questions a Sheldon would, which was funny, but it wasn't in the syndicated episode and it's not on the DVD, plus all the episodes seem shorter than than they should be. For all the money they charge for the DVD sets - Couldn't CBS at least provide the full, uncut episodes of the show? - I have to wonder what Sheldon would say about this.

031603441X|5.0|Life is a fantastic authoritative history of Rock-N-Roll in Britain and the US from 1960 to present.  If you have seen Keith Richards in any interview, as you read this book you will hear his voice through the words.  He most have definitly written the book with some help of course.  All if it is great, but it really interesting hearing about the Ry Cooder Bakersfield tuning of his guitar.  That sound comes through on Some Girls.  Keith and Mick are like brothers who have had enough of each other except when it is time to perform.
0312427999|2.0|Shock Doctrine sat on my shelf for about 2 years, but being someone who has always been interested in the progressive critique of free market economics I decided to finally plunge into Shock Doctrine and read it. I also decided that I will not make any judgments on the book until I finished reading it to the last word. A disclaimer I'd like to make is that even though I am a Libertarian and partial to Murray Rothbard's Libertarianism. As such,I am oppose the fundamentally flawed philosophy of Utilitarianism espoused by Milton Friedman as well as by Keynes and economists on the right and left of the spectrum. The reason I start by saying that is because Klein shows in this work that she does not understand at a fundamental level the ideology and philosophy behind laissez fair capitalism and the stark differences between the different schools of thought and thinkers who claim to be champions of markets. Friedman is very close to Libertarians, but he never claimed to be one and he was always partial to Republican administrations. Milton Friedman was a statist (maybe with a small 's'), who started out as a Keynsian, and thus, the utilitarian Chicago School does not comprehend nor understand, at a fundamental level, that an authoritarian coercive state will ultimately undermine any economic reforms (I advice Klein to read the illustrated Road to Serfdom by Hayekon  Mises.org if she has not had the time to read it yet.)<br /><br />While I agree with Klein in abhorring the US government's intervention militarily and politically in the affairs of other nations, I find her metaphors associating Shock Therapy to 'enhanced interrogation' techniques, and military power applied by the US to poor and helpless countries, quite inaccurate. I highly doubt the Klein intended to mislead the readers when drawing comparisons, but I believe that he ideological bias has blinded her to the point where she cannot write about capitalism, free markets and the history of 'shock therapy' objectively. She also fails to make a distinction between the neomercantilism practiced by the US government, and capitalism (especially in her treatment of the ill-conceived Iraq reconstruction) as preached by the likes of Von Mises or Hayek. To be honest, I am not sure that Klein has read works by any of them, or, if she did, I doubt that she truly understood them. I find it also greatly ironic that Klein critiques comments by Republicans and Democrats who see in disasters an opportunity to prop up the economy and line up their pockets. One of my first economics lessons was by one of my Keynsian professors who explained War Keynsianism to us then proceeded to tell an anecdote about how Keynes at a dinner party started throwing napkins on the floor and stepping on them. When asked why he was doing such a thing, he replied that it was to aid job creation. The concept that disaster and war are beneficial for economic growth originated with Keynsians. Nevertheless, a very outraged Kelin attributes it to Capitalist doctrine and Friedman. It is worth it here to remind Klein that Friedman was one of the staunchest opponents to conscription during the Vietnam war. He and other capitalist Libertarians preached against the war as a destroyer of country's wealth and productive assets, all while a progressive Lyndon Johnson measured its success by how many poor Vietnamese children he could napalm on a certain week and how many young Americans he can use as fodder for that war.<br /><br /> In her treatment of shock therapy Klein shies away from looking at any data about countries like Chile, Bolivia or Russia before shock therapy and after shock therapy. She also does not recount the histories of these countries accurately and omits some key historical facts. For example, despite the difficulty faced by Russia when shock therapy was applied, she fails to acknowledge that soon after the measures were applied goods started appearing in the market and economic activity was surging in apositive direction until the communist block ousted the economic reformers and handed power and state institutions to the oligarchs. If I had her ears, I would advice Klein to read a book called Commanding Heights by Yergin, or watch the PBS documentary by the same name which chronicles that part of Russian history. The same book and documentary chronicles shock therapy and its success in places like India, Poland, Bolivia, and China. I acknowledge the human costs of shock therapy in unemployment and loss of assets, but if she looked at the experiences of such nations, such as Bolivia, whose citizens were living with 30000% a month inflation, shock therapy provides short term (a few years) of pain relative to an eternity of despair and poverty. Countries such as Poland, Bolivia and India that implemented shock therapy have moved from the brink of disaster and have reasonably good economic bills of health. Compare that to East Germany, where the West German government chose a gradual path of integration, maintaining communist era benefits and avoiding the human cost. The East German economy is still stagnant and is a burden to the West German one according to recent articles in Der Spiegel and research published in the US.<br /><br />If we take the confused commentary on economics and poor reporting on the economic situation in south America, the book offers useful views on the failures of the American military-industrial complex in Iraq, the appalling abuses by US corporatist contractors, the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the rising top-secret intelligence complex in the US, and other issues relating to abuses of civil liberties and human rights by the US military-industrial complex all over the world. Kelin's treatment was new and bold in 2009 and for that she deserves credit.<br /><br />Due to the poor treatment of economic issues in the book I give it an overall rating of 2. If you're reading it for economics sake you will find a very emotional treatment of the subject but very little substance. If you are a progressive my advice would be to head to Mises.org and read (for free and downloadable as ePubs) Murray Rothbard's works ([...]). There you will find that free markets do not mean a hegemony by industrialists and a Wall Street elite, nor does it mean that a country like the US has to invade other countries for oil or material gain. You can also read how our current system actually created a 99%-1% schism in society and how that schism can be bridged and wealth flowing more evenly in society.<br /><br />PS: For more debunking Klein's economics read this [...]ion until the communist block ousted the economic reformers and handed power and state institutions to the oligarchs.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was an entertaining series; it kept me intrigued and interested throughout.  I like the way the author ended the book.  It was easy to relate to the characters and many times it seemed that there were lessons we all could learn from the trials encountered by these fictional characters.
B003OBJNPA|5.0|If you are a Bee Gees fan, this is a must. For the price of an online CD you can be at a Bee Gees concert, seeing close ups and a sense you are there enjoying them. Visuals are the best. Sound is as good as it gets. And the best part is hearing these brothers and their blended harmonies. What a unique sound they created. They grew up just wanting to sing and write their own music...and that's what they gave us without knowing how to read music or write it down. Amazing. I will miss knowing they are still writing music as The Bee Gees.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I went through all three books in a week.  Looking forward to more from this author. The detail in the characters and their thoughts will be hard to get out of a movie.  I look forward to seeing the movie though to compare it to the way I saw the characters and plot as I was reading the books.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Was a great book. Could not put it down. Interesting what you can learn these days. Order off my iphone and got to in recod time Great read
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book was recommended by my personal trainer because I have balance issues which she is working to correct through barefoot core training.  Given this was written by a journalist who contributes to \\"Runners World\\", and my trainer didn't say much other than I'd find it inspiring, I expected this book to be a straight-forward,  \\"research driven\\" lesson on how to run and train barefoot.  What an awesome surprise to be instantly engrossed in a fascinating story about two sub-cultures!  The author cleverly interspersed factoids and his over-arching message that shoe company marketing is leading to more injury not less, in the guise of a completely entertaining parable.  This is a story for everyone, not just runners and elite athletes.  What a great read!  And, yes...I was inspired!!

B0063IH60K|1.0|The game is good but please stop already with the ads. I would have rather paid for this than to have an invader bothering me. This should come with a disclaimer.
B0047WJ12K|3.0|This movie has no head nor tail. It seems to me that the purpose of this movie was to launch senseless video games where player pass from one scenery to another, one level to another. The concepts of this film could have been very interesting. However, the story was very poorly developped. The film should have been cut. I am giving 3 stars for the actors/director's work and efforts, the effects and scenery, but I did not like this movie.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I just finished this book and I loved it!  So much so that I wish it did not end.  So now I just bought Colleen's new book and Hope to get as lost in her new book as I did in Slammed!  Read this book, you will not be disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|when I need to kill a bit of time its a good bit of fun<br />with many games. love that it keeps record of best score
B006LSZECO|3.0|I am sorry I spent several hours in the world of this book. Immediately after I finished it felt as though I had been in a cesspool.  It pains me to give it 3 stars but I did finish Gone Girl - was kept reading - maybe because I had spent $12.99 for an ebook.  (Spoiler Alert) The characters are repulsive: he because he is so stupid and vapid and she because she is so successfully vicious.  The ending is tragic because the reader can foresee the dark, twisted future that awaits an innocent.  The only good news is that a day later the whole experience of this read is fading fast.
B005VPSEK2|5.0|I have been really enjoying it. She is the queen of the power ballads. This is an awesome album to rock out to while working out.
1451648537|4.0|This is a great book. The honest insights from peers, employees and competitors really drove the essence of Steve Jobs home.  A total control freak and consumate innovator is what makes Mr. Jobs one of the most important contributors to the technological advancement of everyday people.  In the end, he couldn't control what he wanted to have most control of...his life. His decision to postpone his surgeries proved not as smart as postponing the launch of the Apple. Super inspiration for innovators. Review by C.T. Pam, author of Destiny of Krenoch, Beware the Bumble Bee and Extreme Betrayal.

034580404X|5.0|I haven't read a novel in years and I literally couldn't put it down, didn't want to cook or watch tv. I thought about it when I wasn't reading it. I loved the entire series, well written and all consuming.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Once you get past the warnings that this game has real money game content. This game is pretty addictive and very fun. Fortunately NO ACTUAL money is REQUIRED to play. (It's nice, but not required).<br /><br />But some words of caution for parents: DO NOT GIVE YOUR CHILD UNSUPERVISED ACCESS TO THE INTERNET - EVER!!!! Yes I have children. There are parental controls to prevent the child (or yourself) from impulse buying. Because you, as a parent, have the responsibility to monitor your children, should not blame the game maker for your lack of supervision or not setting the parental controls. (It's like blaming the automobile maker company because you got caught speeding).<br /><br />I have fortunately not encountered any bugs.<br /><br />As with most games this game has an options button that leads to an exit button, a way to shut down the game WITHOUT turning off the Kindle Fire. Of course there is the shortcut, which is just to tap the \\"Stuff\\" icon. This displays the Kindle Fire \\"^\\" menu at the bottom.<br /><br />In summary it is a very simple game that provides hours and hours of entertainment. It does NOT REQUIRE money to play which is rather unusual. Of course spending money does enhance the game. The bad reviews I read had to deal with people not grasping the concept of an exit button in the options menu and people not watching their children or not taking away the credit card from the child. None of which is truly the game/game maker's fault. Get a clue people. Stop blaming everyone else for your shortcomings.
B007KOMTUI|1.0|Can not give it a good rating as we have been unable to view it.  When will season five be available for streaming?
B005USZML4|5.0|The storyline is excellent, but I felt that Mr. Grisham left his readers hanging!  i.e. Who was the body found floating in the river? Was it perhaps the husband of the wife who was murdered?  Very confusing...  Is Mr. Grisham planning a 4th book in the \\"Theo Boone\\" Series?  All three of the Boone series books were well-written, though, and each one's storyline was interesting to the serious reader.  I thoroughly enjoyed the quite factual legal proceedings. Young Theo is a very interesting potential criminal lawyer in years to come.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|the game is fun to play quick to advance. I enjoy playing the characters are cute and fun to do quests
0345803485|1.0|Let's for just a moment ignore the poor writing style (jerky transitions, excessive repetition, lacking development, etc.) Let's also ignore the fact that the content is *gasp* sexually explicit.<br /><br />I live in the Seattle area, and know quite a bit about the Kink (BDSM) scene here, and BDSM in general.  This is not consensual BDSM.  Consensual BDSM includes informed consent from parties who are capable of making sound decisions about their lives.  Neither of the characters in this book are stable and/or emotionally mature enough to do so.  Their inability to communicate with each other is horrifying.  The top is pressuring the bottom, and at one point during negotiation effectively rapes her (when she emailed him 'nice knowing you' he comes to her apartment uninvited to sex with her?).  The fact that the author has written the top as motivated to BDSM via an emotionally traumatic past is just insulting to the BDSM community who constantly have to counter the stereotype that people who do BDSM are 'troubled'.  The content in the book isn't BDSM, it's simply about a dysfunctional relationship, and some kinky toys and concepts that aren't actually used all that much by the characters.
B004CRR9G0|3.0|I wasn't that enthralled with the film. It was a little complicated to understand, even though the storyline has apt metaphors for how human beings live their lives now. Mutually assured destruction - check, disregard for polluting and destroying the environment - check, earth's ability to regenerate and cleanse itself - check, man's continual pursuit of powerful destructive weapons no matter the consequences - check, check, check. It's easy to see the parallels of the people and places of the Valley of the wind, in comparison to our own world. The ohmus were cute, in the movie at least.
B004DMIIO6|5.0|Goemon was a legendary Ninja that is considered the Japanese equivalent of Robin Hood. This movie is a modern, stylized tale of Ninjas, Samurai, and cruel Shoguns in 16th century Japan. This movie contains many other legendary Japanese historical figures. Goemon uses CGI to make the live action more like an anime people jump higher, run faster, etc... The CGI is over the top and sometimes takes away from the story but is generally good. There are a few scenes at the end that are the coolest action scenes I have seen in any action movie. The soundtrack is top notch with sweeping and emotionally charged symphonic music. The humor in this movie seems awkward and out of place and there are about 5 scenes they could have done without. The princess like character has a really stupid name \\"Lady Chacha.\\" The romance between Chacha and Goemon seems forced and a bit awkward. Goemon is overall a really good movie but it is not for everyone. I would highly recommend hard core anime fans seeing Goemon. I am a hardcore anime fan and ninja fan and I loved this movie!
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book is a wonderful account of a single woman finding herself on the PCT. It has inspired me to do more hiking and possibly do some hiking on the PCT.  Strayed writes in a way to keep the reader engaged wanting to read more. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|Got this for my birthday and it was pretty cool.  I love puzzles but hate losing the challenge when I resolve them. That is not the case here.  The friggin ball is so touchy, I played for almost three straight hours and only got to the 29th part.  After a bit of practice I've gotten relativly good at it.  Pretty fun though, not head scratcher tough but a wonderful toy to develop patience.  The course has \\"midpoints\\" so you can try different parts without starting all over again, and you will... a lot.

B008IJTFYW|4.0|Sound patterns great and it's very cool to make layered sounds. The options even has a timer that can create a custom duration. HOWEVER the app needs to be able to continue running in the background when you exit. Also why can't the reviews let you select just a starred group of let's say the 2 Stars like on Amazon.com?
0345803485|4.0|I loved the story line. I literally could not put the book down. The sexual encounters were less than impressive. I think that the story was so intense that it pulled away from the sex part. People said that the mention of her \\"Inner Goddess\\" was annoying. I liked it quite a bit. I think it is because I have moments in my own life where I picture myself ( not necessarily as a goddess) criticizing how I am handling a situation. I love how the books melted together and they did not leave any loose ends open. I have a few more books on my Kindle that I have to read then I plan on returning to the series and reading them through again.
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|Rarely write a review. It's bad don't waste you time.  Main actress good at action scenes bad at acting.  plot line weak.
0425263908|2.0|I loved the fifty shades series and was excited to read this book. But... it was basically an exact replica and I was really disappointed. It's as close to plagiarism as you can get. The writing style was a bit better than the author of fifty shades but that was the only good thing about it.

B0079UVRNI|4.0|I am writing this review in response to the one star review of this Audio Fidelity release provided by a \\"Mr. Withnail.\\"  After reading it, I went to the comments on the review in which a Mr. Stephen Marsh stated that \\"Mr. Withnail\\" had used the same verbiage, and given the same one star, in a number of reviews of Audio Fidelity audiophile Gold CD reissues.  Mr. Withnail denied these assertions.<br /><br />For the record, I don't know Mr. Marsh, I have no relationship with nor work for Audio Fidelity (or Mobile Fidelity or any record company for that matter), and, like others, I have found the results of Audio Fidelity's remasterings to be mixed, ranging from excellent down to \\"just OK.\\" But I was curious about Mr. Marsh's assertion and so I personally checked out the reviews of \\"Mr. Withnail.\\"  It turns out that Mr. Marsh is correct.  Mr. Withnail does give only 1 star to EVERY Audio Fidelity CD release and a number of his reviews reveal both identical (or very similar) negative verbiage, and, despite his positive words about Steve Hoffman and Mr. Withnail's compliments on the products of Mr. Hoffman's DCC label (with which I concur), Mr. Withnail clearly has an animus against Mr. Hoffman and is misusing this Amazon reviewer's forum as a way simply to lower the average ratings on these limited release remasterings whose sales are directed solely to an audience of audiophiles.  I don't know the causes of Mr. Withnail's antipathy twoards (or grudge against) Mr. Hoffman (or against Audio Fidelity) but I am aware that, within this audiophile community, Steve Hoffman's opinions and recent work have brought out passionate responses which, for a few of this limited group, has risen to overt and obsessive hostility. Mr. Withnail seems to be amongst this group and his reviews are likely not based on either purchases or fair listens to AF releases.<br /><br />For those few who care, I think that this AF reissue is very good.  While not as sonically revelatory as the previousfirst CS&N album or Sweet Baby James, it's very listenable, easy on the ears and clearly a few steps up from the mushy sound of the WB plain vanilla redbook CDs.  I also own and have listened to the Japanese SHM-CD releases of the first five or so James Taylor albums (including the first one that was released on Apple Records).  They are also very good but (as is often found in Japanese remasters) are a bit brighter in tone than the AF releases.  So, some listeners may prefer the Japanese pressings while others may prefer the somewhat flatter but warmer results from the AF reissues. Due to the extremely high value of the yen against the dollar, however, these Japanese pressings are currently prohibitively expensive (at around $36 to $40 per CD) for even a great number of American audiophile enthusiasts.<br /><br />In short, there is no one, \\"ur-perfect\\" resissue or remaster, since even when the original vinyl albums were released they often sounded different in pressings made in different countries.  (For example, one could contrast not only the original EMI British Beatles albums against those radically different masterings and pressings on Capitol in the US but also would find differences in the mixes -- as well as in the masterings -- used in the British versus German or Japanese pressings).  For this reason, I think that it is important not only for reviewers to provide thoughtful and honest opinions about the sound quality of reissues and remasterings (whether labelled \\"remastered,\\" \\"deluxe,\\" audiophile gold CDs or whatever) but also for prospective buyers of these CDs to read a number of reviews before pressing the \\"add to basket\\" button, as those opinions will likely differ to some degree or another.  But actual listening and an openness by reviewers to fairly describing the results of these sonic auditions are crucial to the system working.  In this context, reviews such as those by Mr. Withnail can unfairly hurt the manufacturers of these products as wellas confuse rather than educate prospective purchasers and, thus, should be given little creedence by any reader.  Hope this was helpful.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|It's really hard for a novel to make me laugh. This thing had me gut-busting at the end of the first chapter. And it just doesn't stop. Damn good read, good sci-fi-like you wouldn't believe! You want something different And good, read this! You Star Trek fans can't help but love it! I know, I'm one.
B008N1V11U|5.0|I'm reviewing because you people one: need some english lessons, and two: need to let up on the Colorado shooting thing. It doesn't effect whether this game is good or bad. Stop trolling about the shooting and go to school!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|very good app. I like that you can mix the different sounds and close your eyes and feel like you are at a certain place. Very relaxing and I believe it is helping me sleep better at night and clear my head. Also had the cat going a little nuts with the bird sounds,  very entertaining as well.
030758836X|5.0|Just finished reading this book. I could NOT put this book down!! I cannot stand formulaic suspense thrillers. I have stopped reading many books because I could see the end from the beginning. I was shocked and surprised on almost every page. Wonderful story line. The ending left us hanging a little. Maybe a series? Not sure I'll read her other books because of the subjects and plot but this one is completely different.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Such a great book and was delivered directly to my kindle. I am very pleased with the convenience of purchasing this product.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I needed something quick to use on a trip and this app worked great. My $40 Homedic is starting to make weird noises. I'll use this app for now.
030758836X|2.0|I really liked this book...at first. A real page-turner but what happened to the ending??  I recommended this book to several friends while reading it. Then I finished it, called those friends up and begged them to not read it!  This could have had such a great ending but I really don't understand what the author was thinking.  I really had a great time reading this book but there was no \\"wrap-up\\" to the story. Think I will be staying away from Gillian Flynn's books for now.
B008BM9L72|4.0|Whilst I enjoyed the trilogy for what it was - a light, easy, fluffy holiday type of read, I do feel as if there is a bit too much hype about this series... It's enjoyable - as long as you don't need anything like credibility in your plot lines....  A bit too light on for decent content for my personal taste - and - well - to be honest - the sex wasn't that believable.....well - the sex was - the frequency wasn't... Must be a terrible affliction when you can hardly be in a room with someone without feeling the need to rip their clothes off... tee hee...<br />An enjoyable read - but a little lacking for my personal literary taste....
B005DC68NI|5.0|I'm always hesitant to read another book about self-publishing, but \\"Let's Get Digital\\" was definitely worthwhile.<br /><br />I learned new things about the publishing industry, have now accepted piracy is not worth worrying over, had several beliefs re-affirmed, and feel more confident about what I'm doing.<br /><br />I gleaned three new marketing strategies out of this book and that makes me happy.

B003DO13OC|4.0|Treading a path through Oldfield's musical career has always been like walking through an old mine field so a bit of guidance may be necessary. Ommadawn is perhaps his crowning glory and an album a lot of the Oldfield faithful prefer to Tubular Bells it seems, I agree. This particular release (the Deluxe Edition) of the 1975 classic though is perhaps one for the die hard fan. Oldfield has remixed the album for this 2010 release, yes it is interesting, yes you can hear elements not that obvious in the original but it just doesn't have the punch of the original. The massive climax at the end of part one seems to rise from music which is already as loud so you lose the impact. Parts of side 2 now sound too modern also.<br /><br />However, the redeeming feature of this particular release is the inclusion of the original demo. If your an Oldfield devotee you'll love this. It's very interesting to see how the album grew and there are some very weird surprises also! There's also the original mix of the whole album so if you don't like the new mix the old one's there too.<br /><br />I feel I must also point lovers of Ommadawn in the direction of an album I recently found called Mohribold (you must google it!). It's by an emerging artist called Andrew Taylor who surely must have listened to Oldfield's early masterpieces in great detail. Whilst retaining his own flare and style, Mohribold has the texture of those early Oldfield records, something a lot of Oldfield fans really want to hear since Mike went new-age techno on us!
B00008BXJ6|4.0|I bought mainly for the song if you want to Rock and roll, but after listening all the way through - I liked every song on this CD, it is well worth the<br />price paid for.
B003DO13OM|3.0|Treading a path through Oldfield's musical career has always been like walking through a mine field so a bit of guidance can be called for.<br /><br />Ommadawn is perhaps Oldfield's crowning glory and an album a lot of the Oldfield faithful prefer to Tubular Bells and I agree. Sadly though Oldfield has tinkered a little too much with the mix on this release, sadder still it's likely to stay this way. The basic problem is this; the end of part 1 is a thundering crescendo, one of the finest, most dramatic, emotive and exhilirating pieces of music ever written, it rises from the preceding music and knocks you clean over, well it did before the levels were all balanced out anyway. Now the whole piece seems to sit at the same level and it's lost it's dynamic force. Part 2 fares slightly better in the remix but the irish folk section featuring Paddy Maloney (of the Chieftans) now sounds so cheesy with all that extra reverb, it used to sound raw and earthy.<br /><br />All is not lost though; the original mix is available with the deluxe edition of this release, so if I were you I'd spend just a little extra and get that one instead.<br /><br />I feel I must also point lovers of Ommadawn in the direction of an album I recently found called Mohribold.

0553296981|5.0|I have read Anne's diary a few times(I own the Definitive Edition), and I really love it, a lot of people say that it's a bad book, because it rambles on and on. Well, it's a diary, a lot of people who write in diaries ramble. She had no idea that one day her diary would be world famous! So how was she supposed to know that people all around the world were going to read it! But overall Anne Frank was a good writer and too bad that she died during the holocaust. I do recommend this book to people who love history, WWII, Anne Frank, or just diary books to read this book! It can teach you how the Jewish were during World War II, especially if they were hiding! I hope you enjoy this book too~ :)
B0052WKZZ6|4.0|The remastering of Incantations follows on in the same vein as the three previous releases, only this time round there has been no tinkering of the mix, it was always great anyway. We've lost a little top end and gained some warmth which, in my opinion, is a very good thing. There were always glitches on this record right from it's release in 1978, like the wobble at the start of side 2 and some straining of the tapes during one of the choral sections, those problems are now rectified and we are left with a more detailed sound. Not a great mix of Guilty though, not sure why it sounds so slow.<br /><br />Disc 2 is better than your avergage bonus disc. Northumbrian is a little gem, a great melody and a prominent picked acoustic guitar aswell as Mike playing the Northumbrian pipes himself. Oldfield tinkles the old ivories on Piano Improvisation, this is a rare and appreciated example of a solo recording, no multiple overlays on this one. There are some great b-sides here too; Wrekorder Wrondo sounds great and finally on CD we have Pipe Tune with more northumbrian pipes and a melody that carries you to the same magical land of Incantations!<br /><br />I'm glad I bought this re-master, all these re-issues have re-stirred a passion for this music which has led me to the recent discovery of an album called Mohribold by an emerging artist called Andrew Taylor (google it!). He's like Oldfield but also has a distinct sound of his own. If you like Incantations you'll love Mohribold, simple as that. I can't find it on Amazon but google the album, I downloaded it from his page on a site called bandcamp.
B00005U122|4.0|Mr Waters, love this concert BUT, it's 2012, why aren't you releasing your concerts in bluray?<br /><br />-a fan<br /><br />_definitive comments answers welcomed, no conjecture please.
B003DO13O2|5.0|To remaster AND remix an album some thirty-five years old is fittingly unorthodox for the multi-instrumental genius that is Mike Oldfield. Of his early works Hergest Ridge is the one that always needed it most. Previous so called remastered releases have done nothing to rememdy the album's apparent muddiness perhaps caused by the low quailty of tape availble at the time(?). This release though reveals Hergest Ridge as the towering, glorious masterpiece it always was.<br /><br />Lots of things have been fixed. I was always uncomfortable with the albums sharp intro which is now a graceful fade in. The heavy 'thunderstorm' section in part 2 used to sit too quietly in the mix like it had been plonked in cut and paste style. Now though, it is as raucous, punchy and thunderous as it deserves. In fact as I'm writing I am listening to this section and it seems to have brought on a torrential downpour outside my window, the sheer power of Oldfield's music always was tuned in to nature!!<br /><br />Oldfield fans of old will also be delighted at the inclusion here of the original 1974 mix availble on cd for the time. I always prefered this to the Boxed mix which appeared on every release post 1976. In Dulci Jubilo might not be what you're expecting also, it's actually an earlier more sparse version originally released as B-side.<br /><br />So all in all a most worthwhile release. I must also take the opportunity to recommend an album called Mohribold by an artist called Andrew Taylor that I recently heard. He's clearly something of the new Oldfield on the block and with little coming from Mike these days a most welcome musician. If you're a lover of Hergest Ridge, Tubular Bells and Ommadawn you'll love it! As an emerging artist though you won't find it on amazon yet so I guess you'll have to google the album instead.
B006ZZANG0|5.0|Saw Rufus Wainwright in Montreal - fell in love!  Bought his CD upon returning home - play it all the time and can't wait to see him in concert again.  Very pleased with the source of my CD.

B003FVI2KQ|5.0|I got this processor new and it was the last I have seen available. I was able to easily overclock it to 4GHZ and it stays very cool with the Corsair H80. If another becomes available I will buy it!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|A friend loaned me the first book and I finished it before my vacation was over.  I had to drive around until I found wireless service so I could download the second book.  It did not disappoint!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read this book in 2 days!! It was exciting and kept me wanting more.  I could not put the book down!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading the first in the series and being completely mesmerized by it, I could hardly wait to read the second. And I did read it in a matter of days. And all I can say is that if you have read the first book, you absolutely must read the second book!<br /><br />I felt like the book did an excellent job of picking up right where the first book left off. The characters that we have grown to love were there--Katniss, Peeta, Gale, and more. I found the plot of this book even more engaging than the last. I don't want to put any spoilers in this review, so I won't say much. But I truly think that Suzanne Collins's readers will find this book as engaging or more engaging than the first.<br /><br />It is nice to report that there is absolutely NO profanity in the book. A sexual encounter is implied (but we all know it did not really happen). The violence depicted in the book is the most difficult part of the book to read. But I will say this--it is necessary to get the point across.<br /><br />As I read the book, I realized that if we don't start speaking up and telling the government to stay out of our business, we are honestly in danger of having something like this book happen. It seems that as time goes on, we become less and less concerned about government involvement in our personal lives. I am grateful for U.S. checks and balances in our government, and may we fight to keep those.
B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|Was good for the price The movie is great, probably one of my favorites and blu ray HD 1080p Quality knock the heck out of DVD in terms of sound and video, however the case seems to be cheap, no booklet and the Blu ray is not recognized the tittle by online connection, It kindda feels like is not a original copy but I cannot asure that, if is a copy they do a great job. I wish the wide screen blacklines where a smaller or even prefer a fullscreen version. But for the price, you cant ask for much! pretty cool movie and aceptable quality for the price.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|awesome pic editor!!<br />works great on the kindle fire and very cool effects definitely recommend this one to anyone who takes pix
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is awesome .its lots of fun.  it gives u so many games that ur never bored .that u can play all day on a rainy. day
B00571F26Y|5.0|Very interesting and an eye opener for me. There must be hundreds if not thousands of people living with reactions to gluten and not realize it.I changed my eating habit just slightly and saw positive effects right away.  Would recommend this book to anyone who even suspects they may have a 'wheat problem'. Well researched and easy to read.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Not as good as the first two, it rambles and becomes confusing. Looses continuity and the message becomes questionable, if there is a message.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app is wonderful, it has multiple translations and reading plans to suit your preference. I. absolutely love that it also has audio readings for some of the translations.

B0057RCFQS|5.0|I ordered on a Tuesday it came on that Friday. I honestly forgot about it because it was an impulse buy!! Three Jurassic Park movies in a collectors set at $23 including shipping- I had to!! :) it came in a white thick cardboard box and the cellophane wrapped set was wrapped even more in parchment paper. I was very pleased with how it was delivered and the speediness. Thank you for taking so much care in shipping these items too me!!
0061122416|5.0|This book is very inspiring. I was only reading several pages of the introduction part and it already gave me some enlightenment! It's been a long time since I've read a good book like this. Paulo Coelho took us in our imagination to join the adventure of a young boy who was searching of his treasure and Personal Legend, but at the same time, also told us the lessons of life, to pursue what we really want to be, to reach our dreams and to be a person whom God wants us to be. Very inspiring, indeed. :) If you want to find a book that is motivating, this is that kind of book.
0345803507|5.0|The 3rd book in the series was just as good as the first and second. It kept me hooked, I couldn't put it down until I was done. The growth of Christian and Ana is fantastic. I think everyone should read all three books from start to finish. I can finally say I did not cry reading this book. I had tears of happiness in my eyes reading when they survived the challenges they went through. Again I hope the author does more. If not with Christian and Ana how about Christian's brother and sister. Those would make great stories as well. I don't know how anyone can not get hooked on this series.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Très bon livre. Très intéressant de suivre quelqu'un qui retourne dans le temps.  J'ai bien aimé ce livre.  On s'attache au personnage principal.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Yes, it is erotic but if you get past that and really read the book it has an excellant story line. I became so engrossed in Christian and Ana's connection that I felt as if I was seeing it through Ana's eyes. I cried at the end of this book and couldn't wait to go to the next book. I don't know how readers can say this was written by a teenager, it definately was NOT! I have heard some rumors about more books with Christian and Ana and I hope SO. I would be first in line to read them.
0307716546|3.0|After bestselling SISTER, Rosamund Lupton's follow up novel AFTERWARDS is another captivating book full of suspense and what it means to love your children and your husband. However, just like Lupton's first novel, this novel is told in a gimmicky point of view, and in my opinion that takes away from the novel.<br /><br />We find out right away that Grace Covey is at Sports Day for her son Adam. Her daughter Jenny is working as a school \\"nurse\\", even though she is only 17. A fire breaks out, and Jenny and Grace are badly injured. No spoiler here, Grace and Jenny find themselves outside their bodies at the hospital and are able to see everything going on and are able to talk to each other.<br /><br />As observers of life, they are able to \\"investigate\\" what really happened at the school that day. They do this by following Sarah, Grace's distant sister in law and police officer. There are really a lot of twists in the mystery. There are well rounded characters too, such as the recently fired teacher all the kids loved, and the best friend whose husband may be abusing her.<br /><br />The mystery evolved slowly, but always kept my interest. The novel bogged down in parts where Grace reminisced about her past with her husband or kids, or got philosophical about marriage or parenting, even though at times she had great observations.<br /><br />While I enjoyed this novel, and recommend it, its biggest problem is that it is too much like the first book she wrote. The gimmicky point of view is interesting, but gets old after awhile.
0345803493|5.0|Again I was hooked right from the beginning. Book 2 was even better than the first book. This author is so good, she writes in such a way that you instantly form a connection with Christian and Ana. You feel exactly as Ana does. Just like the first book, I cried. I won't tell you why because you should read this book. It is a quick read and as soon as I was done with the first book I started this one. As soon as I was done with this one I started the third. Excellant and I hope we hear more from Christan and Ana.
B003LXSY60|5.0|Simple but \\"stabbing\\" lyrics. I really enjoyed this album. There is not a song I skipped but I have more than a handful of fav. Definitely a great buy.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I recently let my sister purchase this app on her kindle fire app to help her sleep. she says she loves it and its very soothing to me as well. I think that its amazing that the app is free. thank you who ever invented it.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Boring and poorly written. Sex scenes were average and nothing that I would call erotic. Main character is so annoying and weak, and I felt<br />myself shouting at her all the time.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Fifty Shades...is so poorly written, I am only half way thru and I'm not sure I want to finish Book One. I've read free books better than this one.
B000SGSU58|3.0|I have read many books by Michael Connelly and they are always entertaining. This was my first book I read on my Kindle and I had to get used to the shorter pages, but I still turned them at a pretty fast pace. Connelly surprises you with the twists and turns he developes. This was not the best I have read by him, but it certainly won't be the last.
B005K17RU0|3.0|well u can't get on it if u don't have wi-fi but when I'm at home I can check the weather but when I go somewhere its kinds useless.
B007SGM084|4.0|Not my normal genre but when I had three different friends recommd them to me in one weekend I thought I would see what all the fuss was about. What a great, sad, happy, story! Please remember this is a work of fantasy/fiction as some of it is pretty unbelieveable. I am impressed these are the first ever books written by this author. Look forward to seeing what she comes up with in the future.
B002RIA00S|5.0|Tracy Chevalier is a favourite author of mine. I loved how she created the world of Vermeer and his household. The portrayal of Griet is as delicate and well wrought as the image of the girl with the earring itself. You can almost smell the tincture in the paint, and the pain Griet feels as the artist slowly moulds her to be what he wants but ultimately must spurn.
1469984202|5.0|Excellent series.  I can't wait for more.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.  It definitely makes you think about what the human races is capable of, for both good and evil.
1469984202|5.0|I am not a big SciFi fan and had reservations when the Omnibus Edition was recommended to me (with around 300 five star reviews). I contemplated the purchase for a couple of weeks while I finished up another book. I decided that since I needed to order more, I might as well go for it.  After I pulled the trigger, the next two weeks were a pure joy.<br />The story kept me constantly engaged. The plot was laid out in a way that I didnt \\"predict\\" what would happen next.The Author does a good job of giving you the answers that inevitably come up but doesnt get lost in details, he lets your imagination fill in the blanks.<br /> I have recommended the book to several friends now and everyone agrees that it is a good book that provides for a great discussion.  It didnt feel like overt Science Fiction, it was a great story told in a unique environment.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I just cant stop playing this game it's sooooo addictive!!!  I love everything about it I really really really do
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Challenging and fun. They keep adding new puzzles, which explains the vague numbers mentioned. I got it as a free app of the day, so I consider myself lucky; I wouldn't have paid $4.95 for it. Is it worth that? It depends on whether or not you like this type of game.
B007EC27QM|5.0|this app is excellent on my kindle fire.  the calculator takes the entire screen, when you have fat fingers that's a plus trust me.
B008KRJWEK|1.0|it is the best game fir about two days then I try to play it and it loads for about a minute and go's. back to regular kindle screen must fix!
B006C5FWH8|3.0|Not a bad game but too bare-bones compared to the original Space Hulk we loved and played in the '90s.  Gameplay is smooth but I'd like to see more missions and maybe the inclusion of a decent rulebook.  It can be frustrating when you don't know what all of the symbols on the map mean or how to use them or you don't know what the victory conditions are.  Also, a \\"zoom out\\" feature would be great so that you can see the entire map at once without having to scroll around.<br /><br />3 out of 5 stars.  Good game for the price but somewhat lacking in the details.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great fun and makes you think. I'm glad my friend shared this app with me. My new favorite time killer.  Try It out!
B008CPRLP2|5.0|This book was first given to me after the horrific death of my niece whose funeral I could not attend. I found great comfort and direction between the pages of this book, and have since ordered copies and given to others who are going through the grieving process. I was thrilled to find the condition of this book was excellent so I could pass it on to a grieving soul!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The 2nd book was almost better than the first. I like that Ms. James continues the book in the way that she does. It is very very good.
B007JRU2UK|3.0|Saw the previews for this one and rented it.  I had been to Hawaii in 1992 and thought the photography in this movie was great.  I liked the story line, too.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|She did it again. Wow, book was good. now I'm waiting for the next one. Um um um so sexy.
B005ZTFPFQ|4.0|This is my favorite game from back in the \\"day\\".  It is much like the original.  Is fun to play.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|love love love this book. it was very exciting to read. I didn't know it was going to this kind of book. its better than Zane books and i have read all of Zane books.
B00633W614|5.0|One of his better stories.  Cannot wait for the next one to come out.  Love the story about this family saga
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I bought this as a gift, because we liked the one we bought.  This one never worked.  I was embarressed to have given it as a gift.  It was returned to the company and the recipient had to pay $13.00 to send it back.  Very disappointing.

B004DI7HZ6|4.0|In another lifetime, before children, I was an English major studying British literature. \\"A Discovery of Witches\\" reminded me of why I loved college so much: stretching my thinking to accept new ideas and connections made between seemingly incongruent academic disciplines while having one heck of a good time drinking wine and admiring handsome guys. Hey, it was a well-rounded experience!
B008F5YDRI|5.0|I enjoyed the movie - guess there was the salmon fishing and then the fishing  :)  Enjoyable movie would definietly recommend

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app!  it is soo fun because there are so many different games! I really reccomend this app!
B002DD67XG|5.0|James Taylor himself said in a recent interview with USA TODAY that this and the second Greatest Hits record are where newcomers should start. My admiration for the man has grown in recent years, not the least reason being his free guitar lessons on YouTube. All of the songs here have aged well.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Works well on the Kindle Fire. Excellent free app with very few ads. Only problem I find is how addictive it is.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app.  I told everyone about it when I found it (and now you too!).  You can listen to police scanners from anywhere - radio stations from anywhere - talk radio from anywhere - WORLD WIDE!.  I love it because I can listen to news from my hometown, even though I'm not there.  It keeps me informed on what's going on at home, while I'm away.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Great book! I didn't expect it to be so raunchy but its really interesting that you can't put the book down! Absolutely addictive! Love it =)
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is wonderful.  You can fall asleep listening to crickets, or the ocean, or music, or all of the above.  You can control how loud 1 sound is over the other.  It is excellent, unbelievable that it's free on top of it.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|I love this series very good. It keeps you wanting to know what happens next. When you think you know what is going to happen or who it is it catches you by something else happening.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a awesome game but it is really adicting game I'm so close to 1.000.000 so u have to try so hard!but its really fun!!!!:)

B000JMKTLO|4.0|Well written and I was sorry when the book ended.<br />I was hoping to find a 2nd , follow up book.
034580404X|5.0|So many people have claimed this erotica to be porn but lets face it, everyone has sexual encounters and some more than others. No, not every part of the book can attain to reality but who said this book is non-fiction? It's a fun plot and the real story begins in the middle of the second book until the end of the series. I hope the author continues to write the book series in Christian Grey's point of view. Sometimes it can be biased because Ana is telling the story and I'm sure the avid reader wants to know what Mr. Grey is thinking half of the time and if he truly did change his ways for her and why.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read the whole series and am re reading it. I loved the ending of mockingjay, but (SPOILER ALERT) hated how Prim died.
B000FC12Z0|4.0|This book is great. we saw the movie years ago and had forgotten the whole story.  It is so well written, humorous and Agatha Christie keeps the mystery as always to the last!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|outstanding. can mix the sounds to create harmonious music that is very pleasing to the ears. highly recommended to those who enjoy serene music
B000OVLINI|4.0|This is an excellent book. It was sad and yet had such a good storyline. If you like mystery and murder along with faded love you will find the mix here.
B00846REIS|5.0|Just read this book in 2 days, cant wait till the next one comes out.If you loved 50 shades of grey then start reading this book now. Loooooooved the story and the charactures, would definately read more books by Sylvia Day.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good fun awesomely perfect fun fun fun hard boring fun fun fun fun fun gun fun fun fun fun fun
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game reminds me of old school super Mario and is pretty darn fun. if you like old nintendo games you'll like this.
B006LSZECO|5.0|OMG!! I haven't read a page turner like this in a long time!  Even when the mystery is resolved you still have about 44% (I read it in Kindle.) of the book to go before you arrive at an ending.  The ending is not the one I would have chosen, but it's good nevertheless.  This is the first book I've read by Gillian Flynn and I can't wait to read more.
B007SK8WJ6|5.0|So i go sick of waiting for the free version on websites that offer this for free to view but with commercials. It was money well spend. This show is so bad asserary.
1936608898|5.0|Just felt obligated to write a review to let other people know how great this book is.<br />The advice and ideas in this book, backed with solid facts and science, are life changing and worthy of your<br />attention, even if you are a skeptic.<br /><br />Simply put, its fantastic.<br />Highly recommended.
0307279189|4.0|Great read, for all different walks of life. Anyone who loves lifes simple pleasures should read this one. Stories that show it does take all different kind to make this world go around.
B0040JHWKS|4.0|Great 2 disc cd collection. Bruce never lets me down, I know I can buy his cds without fear. If your a fan, its a simple choice. Pick it up today. Could be two seperate cds on their own. Each cd has strong tracks and weak but even the weak tracks are great! You know your talented when your unreleased songs are better than the usual songs on the radio these days.
1453624910|5.0|I love this series this novel tied up some lose ends now I know why some of the supporting characters are the way they are.  I'm very glad I purchsed this book!
B000ENWKN8|3.0|I get it, bands get tired of the same old same old and want to try new things. Rob did on this cd, and some songs are good. Some take a few plays to grow on you. But over all this album sucks. I have every Rob Zombie/White zombie cd out there and this is the weakest out of them all. Some might say \\"you just want to hear HEllbilly Deluxe over and over\\" and you know what? Your right. I became a fan because of Astro Creep and Hellbilly Deluxe. So yes, release the same album over and over with different lyrics and sound. Thats fine by me. Thats why you love certain bands not because they decide to change it up and try new things. The new sometimes is good but in this case its not.<br /><br />If your a fan, get the cd its not a choice you have to learn for yourself if its for you or not. I still own the cd and will put in on from time to time. Has a few solid tracks, and will grow on you over time. But with a zombie cd it should be right from the start. Hence the bad review.
B005QUQP76|5.0|The Corsair M60 gaming mouse is rock solid, has adjustable dpi tracking, and a sniper button, making it ideal for FPS (first person shooter) gaming.  I'm very, very happy with it.
B0000VCZK2|4.0|Amazing how this whole set is only 20 bucks!! An easy buy if your a fan, each movie comes with making of and unrated film. THe package for the movies could have been better but for 20 bucks I will worry about that another time.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I honestly don't know what all the hype was about. One of the poorest written books I've read in a long time. And to add to it, the characters were unlikeable, the dialog was corny, and plot was non-existent. Took me several weeks to trudge through this book. I kept thinking it just has to get better...why would so many people like it? But it doesn't! It gets worse!! Don't waste your time.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Quite peaceful.  Good that you can set a time limit on how long it plays.  Very realistic sounds and the volume is also able to be controlled separately for each sound.
B000TETD9Q|5.0|Great music with all the classic beach boy songs. If you like the beach Boyd you will like this collection of songs
B000FQJAIW|4.0|Only reason I bought this was for the Original Theatrical Version and I'm content with them. The blurriness during wide shots (particularly in the desert) and grain count of the film don't detract enough to make me like it any less. The sound could be touched up, but hey this is what we got and I'm content until some improved original theatrical version is released.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|This is a great series. Full of suspense. Great acting. Can be a little gruesome and somewhat shocking, but all in all a great story to follow.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|hi i am still young but when i get older i am going to be a author i want to fallow in suzanne collins foot steps thanks for wrighting the hunger games becuse with out you i would never want to be a author and every one said i could never be as good as a reader like all the other kids thank you mrs.lee for not giving up no me and may the odds ever be in her favor
B000PC0U1W|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites. Creepy, funny, action packed awesomeness, great message, beautifully done. See it if you haven't.
034553056X|5.0|OK, 5 star book.  I know because I could not put it down last night and finished at 230 am.<br /><br />John Grisham is back.  The book is gritty, timely, tight and just a fine story about a two bit shop of a three lawyers.  The protagonist is the new guy who stumbles out of the huge law firm working 100 hours per week into the ambulance chasers firm.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really liked this series! Book 1 and 3 were my favorite but as a whole they were really good. Will probably read them all again (and i dont usually).
030758836X|1.0|She writes like a sailor talks. Why is it that writers and screenwriters are unable to write without the excessive use of the \\"f-word\\". It is as if they have nothing to say. I do not like the ending. Will not read this author again
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really liked this series! Book 1 and 3 were my favorite but as a whole they were really good. Will probably read them all again (and i dont usually).
B008ASLK8A|4.0|A lot of fun watching Robert Downey Jr. and Jared Harris battling wits.  If you liked the first one, you will definitely enjoy this one as well.
030758836X|3.0|I was really enjoying this book, thinking of friends that would enjoy it..  Then, the ending.  Did the author just get tired?  For the book to be that good and the ending that bad feels like I was cheated!  Haven't<br />read anything from this author before, not sure I will.
B0031ES8P6|3.0|I ordered this toy for my daughter, thinking that it was a fairly good size at 8\\" for a Beanie Baby. I had seen smaller ones in retail stores but thought it was a great price for how they described it. When I received it I was disappointed to find out it was only about 6\\" tall (sitting) and that I actually paid more for it than I would have retail. It is a cute little toy, well-constructed as Ty is supposed to be. I think if you stretch it out you might get 8\\" from it, but highly doubtful. If you're not concerned with the size, though, it is a cute little piece. My daughter liked it - as she loves all things Hello Kitty.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is not invented for the lonely. . . its the best app ive ever purchased.a ton of people have it. and it was freeeeeeeeeee yeah. you should definatly get this treasure of an app<br /> the end
034580404X|5.0|The set arrived quickly - was neatly boxed.  The book size is fine for carrying in an average to large purse.  The print is easy to read and the quality of the paper good.
B0040QYROK|5.0|I saw the completely restored version of this classic film recently, so I wanted to add my comments here. The additional footage does help straighten out some of the subplots in the film, and those extra clips often just pile onto the unsettling nature of what Lang was trying to say cinematically, whether it be the \\"man with the paper,\\" or the additional images of the spoiled and sheltered aristocracy. The original version, although diced up quite a bit, is still grand, but this edition adds a little extra icing to the cake. Lang's dark vision gives us plenty to contemplate here, but as with other silent film spectacles (for example, D. W. Griffith's \\"Intolerance\\"), perhaps the film's greatest asset is its elaborate sets, which would put an imprint on science fiction musings (including Lucas's) for generations to come. Definitely worth seeing, if just for its cultural influence alone.
B005K17RU0|5.0|HTC EVO 4G, works great. Only had installed 2 days but love it. Much better &amp; details I like. Radar Maps r right on &amp; seem real time. Used to decide when to light off fireworks &amp; was right on.
B007MJT1K2|5.0|Forget the \\"hokey\\" title, this is a great movie.  It's incredibly funny in parts and has almost non-stop action.  Oh yes, and the animation is good too.
B00845PV16|1.0|This movie is, to put it nicely, very disappointing. The plot stinks, The acting stinks... It's an absolute hot mess. I would rather gouge out my eyes with a rusty grapefruit spoon than watch this schlock again!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is by far the worst piece of crap I have ever had the misfortune of wasting my time reading. I think it's really unfortunate that there are real writers out there with actual writing skills that are struggling while this garbage is a runaway hit. It's really poorly written, the lead character is a twit, the sex scenes that everyone is so hot and bothered about are ridiculous and it's abruptly ends with no warning and no resolution. I think the author just got disgusted with themselves and had to stop. Really really bad.
B004SBX112|4.0|This game is a lot of fun. Some of it is hard too. I wish there were tips to help, maybe there are, but I can't find them. I do enjoy the game though.
0719079276|5.0|For those who are just starting to learn about literature theory, this is a book I personally recommend getting hold of.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is soo addictive. It is very ideal for long car rides. You always feel as if you have to beat the challenge number, then the level, then the pack, then the game. It's my favorite free game. (:
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|i thoroughly enjoyed the tale. The characters are exquisitely formed, and the dialogue is humorous and poignant. An absorbing story that leaves one as satisfied as Thanksgiving dinner.<br /><br />Try this children's story:  [[ASIN:B0053H9ZO2 Lost in the Woods]]
B008NAFU9A|5.0|As a fan of Rebecca Hamilton's Forever Girl series, I eagerly downloaded this free novella.  What a treat!<br /><br />Ophelia is a servant in England at the turn of the nineteenth century.  Her father wanted better things for her, but her father is dead and her mother is missing, so Ophelia is left to make her own choices.  She goes into service not just to earn a living, however: her employers also employed her mother shortly before she vanished.<br /><br />When Ophelia meets a stranger in the woods, her life changes forever.  Ethan Forrester tells her that she has been chosen for a higher purpose: to bring peace to the world of dual breeds and elementals that Ophelia always thought were merely the bedtime stories of her mother.  But to play her part, Ophelia must sacrifice her humanity...and her growing affection for Ethan.<br /><br />Hamilton gives readers a glimpse of the background of two major players in The Forever Girl, and it's as satisfying as getting the last piece of a puzzle to click into place.  Fans of all things paranormal will love this short addition to the world of The Forever Girl.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|When a young boy is stabbed to death in Andy Barber's neighbourhood, he as DA starts investigating. All to soon the evidence starts to point towards his own son Jacob as the killer. This is more a psychological familydrama than a regular crimestory. The way this family is slowly falling apart from doubt, revealed secrets and the creepy realisation that Jacob is different, is written with a lot of skill and nuance. How do you face the fact that your child could be a murderer,and how do you help him? The story has some of the same creepy and downright scary themes and questions as \\"We need to talk about Kevin\\" Only \\"Defending Jacob\\" is to me, the more subtle and thoughtprovoking of the two books.
B002ZG996I|5.0|One of the reasons I decided to watch this movie was because of JLo and because the guy with her in the poster looked so handsome. I had never heard of Alex O' Loughlin before. Lo and behold! I became an instant fan of Alex after seeing him in this movie. Very handsome, great body, wonderful actor who made the movie light up whenever he was onscreen. He was truly endearing and memorable. As a result, I made it a point to get copies of his other tv series like \\"Hawaii Five-O - Season 1\\" where he currently plays Steve McGarrett (what a transformation - one of the best TV remakes ever), \\"Moonlight\\" (where he played a vampire) and \\"Three Rivers\\" where he played a doctor. I also heard that Alex was considered to be the next James Bond. Alex shows his range as an actor since he is adept in romantic comedy, action and drama. I hope that Alex gets to do more leading man roles on the big screen since he has proven with \\"Hawaii Five-O\\" that he can do action-drama with aplomb and also do dreamy leading man roles in a romantic film like \\"Back-Up Plan.\\" More power Alex!!!
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|Love Criminal Minds! But this season was not my favorite due to the change in cast.  I do not like the Seaver character at all.  But the Emily Prentiss focused episodes were fantastic.  I have all the seasons so far and I recommend this for any Criminal Minds fan's collection.
B005P9SLES|5.0|After seeing Alex O' Loughlin in the very entertaining \\"Back-Up Plan,\\" and being a fan of the old Hawaii Five-O series, I decided to take a chance and get the blu-ray version of this remake after reading positive reviews. So far, we have finished the first 2 discs and I must say that this is pure first-rate entertainment! My family and I make it a point to watch 2 episodes every Sunday night after dinner and we are simply delighted watching every show. The show is fast-paced, well-written, directed and acted. Hawaii is soooo beautiful that it is my dream to one day visit this place. I love the cast! From Steve to Danno to Chin Ho and Kono. I love all of you guys and thank you for giving us this wonderful, endearing show. My brothers, mom and grandmother all enjoy this show which is proof that it appeals to all ages. We always look forward to family dinners every Sunday because we get to see 2 episodes of this fantastic show. Can't wait for Season 2 (even if the pre-order price is quite costly) and congratulatiuons to the whole cast and crew for being given Season 3. Cheers! Seeing this blu-ray version on our 50\\" TV with home theater system is such pure joy. It is an audio-visual feast.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Sounds loop perfectly on my phone - no pauses or dead air while I'm playing it.  Many sounds and melodies are offered with this free app. The timer works great and I like the &quot;close app&quot; feature when the timer runs out.
B007R41E8O|5.0|i strongly recommend this app for anyone who loves a good hidden object game. it has plenty to search for and plenty of mini games and puzzles in between.
B007N8RULO|1.0|I only had this installed for a few minutes. I was just poking around looking at the layout, when the screen paused, went blank and a video ad started! I have no problem with small ad spaces at the bottom of the screen, but this not only interrupted the game, took over the screen, and downloaded a video!!! If you don't have a large data plan, I'd avoid this. I uninstalled it just because the annoyance of the ads were too high of a price to pay for a generic card game with 20+ other versions out.
B0079HLDCQ|5.0|This Baldacci thriller is gripping from beginning to end and contains believable characters, situations and intense action for a really absorbing read
1932100660|5.0|The information in this best selling book will literally show you how to attain the quality of life that we have all dreamed about.  I am a beneficiary of the data presented and a multiple buyer of the book who considers the research information to be so important that my purchases are given to others simply out of love.
B005KELQEU|5.0|I have had several Kindles over the years and love them.  I have found I like to read them \\"naked\\" rather than in a case so I always purchase a sleeve so that I may easily remove the Kindle when reading and slide it back in when finished.<br /><br />This case is perfect.  Well contructed, easy to zipper open and remove the Kindle to read, and easy to slide back in and zipper back up to protect it when not reading.  It has a nice amount of padding so I feel like I can place the Kindle in a purse or other bag and not worry about it being damaged.<br /><br />Note:  I have noticed that many of the folks dinging this case for not being good are largely complaining about the fit.  This case is for the Kindle Basic or Kindle Touch, not the Kindle Keyboard, Kindle First Generation, Kindle Second Generation, or Kindle Fire.  It is very clear in the product description which Kindles this fits.  It seems unfair to ding the manufacturer or the case when people don't know which Kindle they have and order the wrong size sleeve.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very well written, never wanted to put if down.  Enjoyed every detail on the costumes, and each event - Keeping track of all the great imaginary names of each chariture, where they came from,what they wear,what they looked like, made it all the more intreging to just continue on and on. Wondering all the way thru the last two books just will this end. Suspense,intregue,romace All great. Easy to purchase from Amazon.
B008ASLK8A|2.0|Very disappointing after watching the first Holmes.  The plot rambled so slowly that I either lost interest or forgot about the direction of the story completely.  The writers were just at a complete loss.  Uninteresting characters, especially Noomi Rapace's.  Who is she?  Why is she there?  Hard to finish.  Spare yourself.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is such a fun game I hardley stay off of it, its so addicting. I recommend it!!!!:)<br />you'll have fun to I'm sure!!!!!<br />five stars all the way<br /><br />and its great that its free
0765316994|2.0|Finally got the book, with great anticipation.  First few pages started off on a Junior High School level (and not even close to those written for the same demographics by Heinlein).  Never got better. All the hype about the book -what a disappointment.
B003E3TQ64|5.0|many thanks for the fast shipping  my husband really loves this albumn  :-) early anniversary present for him as he said he did not care if it was new or used.
1932100660|5.0|The China Study attributes our nations problem with obesity related disease, cancer and many other health issues to our over fed under nourished habits in society. It couldn't be more dead on. Dr. Campbell has been more than comprehensive in his research and laboratory tests. This book sets itself apart by giving all the data and allowing you to make your own choices based on the evidence, that is backed up by published scientific publications and research. Personally, my wife and I have implemented the advocated  lifestyle and reaped HUGE benefits in our health, activity level and overall well being. I definitely recommend this book to anyone ready to make a change or anyone who has to in order to live long after health issues.
B002MU4NL8|5.0|It's simple: great premise, STELLAR cast, endless laughs.  This is a movie we could watch again and again, and we still laugh just as hard at Alan Rickman and Tony Shalhoub every time.  So, just buy this movie - quick! - before one of those things kills Guy! :)
B007ELN8Y8|4.0|Seeing the female lead was worth the price paid to view this movie.<br />It was a difficult plot to portray sucessfully, but it was successfully portrayed.<br />It was a good flick,  but it did not deserve to sweep the Academy's as it did.
030758836X|5.0|Perfect fix for our Sony wireless TV headphones. Now we don't have to buy new every 2 yrs! Easy to do!
B003Y5HWK4|5.0|For those who were Soprano addicts like myself going through withdrawal symptoms along comes Boardwalk Empire from HBO. Writers from Sopranos and 4 actors from Sopranos are in the 1st season. This is the best show on TV since my beloved The Sopranos. 5 star writing, acting and directing. Cheers!
B008MEM24S|2.0|I thought this would've been fun and creative like the show but the theme is the same throughout all of the levels I've played thus far. It should cost 25 cents...and I am being generous with this review and the suggested retail price.
B005LAII3U|5.0|I just saw this one in the theater and it definitely exceeded my expectations.  I felt like this one was so good, it totally trumped the original.  Granted, the original did not have the benefit of the strong CGI this one did, and no insult intended to Arnold.<br /><br />This one was high action from the minute Colin sat in the chair at Rekall.  The CGI was totally awesome--very futuristic and very creative. The multi-level housing structures suspended across the overcrowded city -- Lots of fighting, running, chasing.  Nifty hover cars on multi-level roadways.  Well worth seeing and owning.  I cannot wait to buy it for the collection.
0345803507|5.0|I DON'T LIKE TO READ BUT THIS BOOK WAS SO GOOD, I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. IT IS QUITE A LOVE STORY WITH A YOUNG ADULT FEMALE AND A VERY SOPHISTICATED YOUNG MAN AND THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS THEY GO THROUGH.  IT IS IN QUITE DETAIL OF ALL THEIR EXPERIENCES THEY ENCOUNTER AND ALL HIS BAGGAGE FROM HIS EARLY YEARS.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great for Kindle Fire! I always  run my kindle battery to the lowest (15%) and this app will tell me exactly how long i can skate by...love this app
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|Such a simple idea.  Such a major failure.<br /><br />How much simpler could it be, popping a rechargeable battery pack into a mouse?  That is, the only mouse the pack is supposedly designed for.<br /><br />I had high hopes, despite all the other negative reviews.  The packaging is Apple elegant. Unfortunately, Mobee didn't give nearly as much attention to the product inside.<br /><br />As so many other reviewers state, the quality of the pack's material, workmanship and fit is an embarrassment (or should be).  Many said their packs fell out.  Mine had such a tight fit, that the flimsy end for the release button cracked as the thin cover locked into place.<br /><br />After 8 hours of charging, the green charging light still flashed.  So I pried the pack out of the mouse and set it on the charging platform by itself, overnight.  By morning, it was fully charged.<br /><br />I squeezed it back into the mouse, slid up the power switch, and nothing.  Dead.  No green light.  No recognition by the iMac.  I'll be shipping it back today.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor Amazon.  Separate yourself from this abomination. Discontinue it.
0817439390|1.0|understanding exposure - bryan peterson<br />this book is very poorly designed.  the 2 page photos are only there to take up space.  by extending the photos to 2 pages the reader loses interest in the subject matter.  the macro,<br />close up photos, are  uniteresting to the point of being totally boring.  however you would think that a photographer with such high credentials as the book editor claims would place some interesting photos in the book.<br />i would rate the photos at a very amature level and not of much interest.<br />there is some good information in the book, but not much.<br />it is very difficult to maintain your attention on such a poorly deigned book with less than amature photos.  i have owned this book for 4 months and am still not half way tru it.  when trying to read it i try not to look at the photos, however it is unavoidable.<br />i would not purchase this book had i previewed it before i purchased it.<br />my best recommendation is to read your owners manual.[[ASIN:0817439390 Understanding Exposure, 3rd Edition: How to Shoot Great Photographs with Any Camera]]
B008EQIJQO|5.0|Loved this movie! Sweet story, charming leads and funny too. Anyone with a heart will enjoy this film. Glad it won the Oscar.
B007SGM084|5.0|I had heard from many people that I should read these books! I am glad that I did. When I started to read them, I couldn't put them down. I finished all 3 books within 1 weeks time. I am currently reading them again because I loved them so much the first time!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I stumbled across a recommendation for this book. I read the reviews. At first I was suspicious but then thought NOBODY has this many friends and family. What a rare treat to find such a taut, polished book self-published. My compliments to what I suspect will soon be a wildly successful author!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Not as good as the first book of course, but definitely couldn't put it down! Must read and can't wait to get to the next one!
0545101417|5.0|I've read the other reviews where they felt the book was a transitional story in between the 1st and 3rd books (Audio Books in my case).  I totally disagree.  I found the 2nd book very suspenseful to where I could stop listening to it and even had dreams about it.  I guess my only complaint about the author is that she does not know how to end a book.  After dragging out the dramas throughout the book, she seems to be lost in how to close the story and she quickly puts a lot of things together and it ends.  It moved so fast, I had to relisten to some sections a few times to figure out what happened.  The same thing happened in the first book except that there was too much of anti-climax in the ending following the big climax which was starting to get me bored.  Actually, I felt that the 1st book should have ended right after the hunger game and Peeta and Catniss flying back to the Capitol and the events in the Capitol should have been in the beginning of the 2nd book.  But that's just how I thought it would have flowed better.  I'm hoping the author does a better job in book 3 (Mockingjay).
B00846TTDG|1.0|Where did they find these actors.  What are people thinking to like this. This would have been better as a documentary so at least you could listen to Morgan Freeman's voice and expect bad acting.  Give us another black hawk down.<br /><br />You have a better chance of committing suicide then to die in combat if your a soldier in the war on terror. That's a realistic war movie.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is fun. but if you don't want to buy acorns, you don't have to, you just have to be patient
145551389X|5.0|My best friend gave me this for my birthday and I love it! The photography is great, and Lady Gaga is great, so what's not to like? It looks great on my coffee table and my friends and I like thumbing through it from time to time. And the book is really thick and heavy; you get a lot of content. It's a cool buy for any Gaga fan!
B0053TMP24|5.0|The Son Of Neptune by Rick Riordan was a sequal that built beautifully on The Lost Hero.  With the return of Percy Jackson from the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series the book takes a turn that readers will not soon forget, with these first two books Rick Riordan has layed the ground work for a marvelous series.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is just so addicting and so mad fun. Its like the best app ever especially on a kindle fire.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|Loved it. Finale was awesome and I cannot wait for season 4. I couldn't stream it on my iPad which is disappointing  but it could have been my own lack of knowledge on how to work the thing. Overall, fantastic!
1401233791|4.0|DC has finally decided to collect the entire Knightfall saga (Knightfall, Knightsquest, and Knightsend), and it all starts here.  The value on this package is excellent - especially after the Amazon discount.  Over 24 separate issues are collected here, with the Vengeance of Bane special, and Batman 500 both being extra-length issues.  Previously, the Knightfall story had only been collected in two-separate volumes.  The story itself is good, though it certainly doesn't belong in the Dark Knight Returns, Year One, etc. Batman pantheon.<br /><br />A few things stick out after a re-read.  First the addition of the Batman: Vengeance of Bane special is critical to any understanding of why these characters show up and start to wreak havoc on Batman's life.  This edition is missing a similar introduction for Jean Paul Valley aka Azrael in this volume, and his origins and motivations are only hinted at.  The first half of Knightfall (up to the fateful Batman/Bane confrontation) is extremely strong, as a increasingly weary Batman faces a murderer's (literally!) row of his greatest enemies.<br /><br />There are a number of artists working the various issues, so there isn't the consistency one might hope for.  The late Jim Aparo's art was somewhat dated at the time, and certainly hasn't become more modern with age.  Graham Nolan was the best of the artists contributing to the book, though the initial three-issue Norm Breyfogle run is also quite good.<br /><br />All in all, it's a classic story that deserved to be collected in one volume.  New readers have an opportunity to explore a major story in Batman's past, and old reader's can take a trip down memory lane for a very fair price.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl is a good,quick read.  It kept me guessing.  I really enjoyed it.  It's a good summer beach read.
B003XQHF60|5.0|Great movie and for a great price. I'm a fan of all the robin hoods but I loved the perspective of this particular one! Even better I can watch it on my kindle fire while camping!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is adventurously amazing and it is definitely worth what ever amount of space it takes up on your device.
B005LAII1C|1.0|Well it does not work if you do nice cartoons that all of a sudden you would pull off a decent movie. Very limited jokes, not funny, screenplay is boring. Foul language out of an alive teddy bear, a couple of ridiculous fart jokes, promotion of pot and alco. Frankly do not understand who is the target audience - for grown-ups it is a little too childish, not interesting and not funny. For kids - way too much drugs, drinks and flame.<br />Yay to cartoons, which are always very nice and stop experimenting with movies.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game was wonderful for my 10 year old gifted child and myself.  It gave both of us some fun and quick puzzles to start with and then really challenged us toward the later ones.
B0087UNURU|5.0|Well worth the price.  Enjoyable listen over and over again.<br /><br />Purchased thru Amazon. Downloaded easily. Plays without a flaw.<br /><br />One.
0316023744|5.0|I am not an expert historian.  But I am fascinated by history, especially when it is described in a way that is holistic, accessible and organized.  Anthony Beevor's \\"Second World War\\" is all of that and much, much more.  I was born in 1953 and I've never even been to Europe or Japan.  Never the less, I've always felt that the Second World War has had a profound influence on my life in many ways, most of which I'll never even know.  This book helped me understand some of those influences and how they came about.  It provides a detailed description of the Second World War without being either tedious or grandiose.  The book also helped me understand the vast scale of World War II in a non biased way.  It was a pleasure to read and is truly an outstanding achievement for Mr. Beevor.  I'm sure I will refer back to it many times in years to come for details I have forgotten or never really understood in the first place.  As such, it is also a lifetime treasure for me.
B007ORVC36|3.0|This episode was just okay. However, Mad Men has not let us down and I look forward to seeing what happens in the next few episodes.
B0086700CM|4.0|I really like the app, it keeps your score (number of times used, high score, number of coins collected, etc.) I have had it for a couple months, and it seems the longer its there the worse the graphics get. besides the point that there is really no point to play it, that is my only problem.
B005BHNCO8|3.0|It is an ok product for the price, not well-built. I only used once, there is a part already not working, but it is still usable.
B00881VLCE|5.0|i love this game good time killer and i love all the pictures. love how you can choose to do borders first and love how clear all the pictures are.
B008N1V11U|3.0|I never played this game before but it takes up ALOT of space.I'm sure the gameplay is fun but I wouldn't get it.It takes up 8 hundred something space.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Easy read, but to call it hot is going a little far. Lot of sex, but nothing out of the ordinary like the tiles of these books would make you think. Pretty tame......
B007SGM084|3.0|I liked the psychology aspect of the characters. I like how they evolved and grew with each other and how Christian overcame his past. However, Ana sure got on my ever last nerve with her flushing and blushing! I also feel that the build up to an event was much longer than the event itself. I also feel I paid too much for the series.
B004V6VGHU|5.0|I still can't believe that this is a used book.  I was practically untouched.  What an unbelievable product for an amazing price.  Thanks again.<br /><br />Eddie O
B0063IH60K|4.0|Nice flow.. Easy to play.. Does have ads, but what free games don't? I do enjoy this game!! I'll def keep playing it..
B008BM9L72|3.0|Not quite sure what the hype is about, but have read the books as I felt I had to know what it is all about. Plenty of explicit sex - do they ever get tired of it? The storyline could be more interesting, as it does actually get a bit tiresome to hear about their sexplicit exploits all the time. Hot stuff indeed and in a way I guess a bit of a sex education, too, for some.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|It is an amazing game. Spider the game has really good graphics.Also it is along game and each level makes sense and is fun.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|The movie was in good condition, it arrived on time, and when I played it , there were no skips , etc.<br />I am pleased with the purchase.

0393330435|5.0|As a board member of Apple China, I know personally that only certain few people change the world, and it deserves rightful mention that the Original Apple Co-Founders, 2 Time Nobel Laureate Steven Wozniak and Apple Innovator, Founder Steven Jobs invented devices which not only changed the world but saved the inquisitive minds and lives of technological humans that hold innovation with obeisance.<br />In, iWoz, it informs the curious masses about Nobel Winner Wozniak's Apple 2 Computer which was the first computer to sell 1 million units around the world skyrocketing Apple Inc. to record high stocks on Nasdaq and creating dozens of millionaires in one day. Through all success and secrecy of more advanced technology for the company it should be well known Nobel Wozniak's father worked in secrecy for Lockheed. With such strict and formal upbringing for a technological engineer it is palpable more extraordinary inventions will arise from the Trillion-Dollar-Apple-Empire.<br />With past success of his company and funds Nobel Wozniak, also funded hard rock arena festivals in Europe to bridge peace and musical harmony with America and the European nations which was broadcast via satellite around Europe. He became so successful he added philanthropy to his ever growing social repertoire. Donatng tens of millions of dollars to educational arts and sciences including music schools and ballet programs that which the Mayor of San Jose dedicated a Famous Street for him. WOZ WAY.<br />There are also facets to his life in Apple China about how he trained as an engineer to work first hard and alone without so much as being lonely, and how it abetted his passions in the current state of positivity. As a quote from Nobel Wozniak, ' If you're that rare engineer who's an inventor and also an artist, I'm going to give you some advice that might be hard to take. That advice is: Work Alone.' It is passages so insouciant and profound as this that a consummate inventor and incremental master innovator knows, to vacillate from working alone or to working with a team, so that success will build upon many minds or one single great mind such as a founder or president, C.E.O. to create millions of jobs for America, such as Apple China has done and continue the prosperity in the immediately rapid and far future.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Ever since I got my Kindle Fire, I've been looking for a really good weather app. I've been dissatisfied with Weather Channel and Accuweather, since I can't get the radar maps to work well. \\"Weather Live\\" doesn't have maps, but the graphic display is easily the best that I've seen yet. I have friends and relatives around the country, and I like to check their weather, and Weather Live is very easy to set up other locations and go to them by swiping the screen.<br /><br />Hopefully, the developers will eventually add weather maps, which would put this app above the other weather apps that I've seen.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I wanted more about Christian and his freedom... I felt like I could have wrote this myself.  No imagination and a lack of original thought.  Also, the hot sex got to be annoying and I would skip over it most times.  Took me less than a week to read the first 2 books.  It took me over a month to finish Freed bc I was so bored.
B0086700CM|5.0|My friend showed it to me first, and I really wanted to get it. Then I found it here just yesterday and I was so excited. It's the best game ever. Get it.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game. I play it every night on my iPad and everyday on my phone. I never have a problem with the app either.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I like the Microshell folio cover very much. It fits my needs. It is easier to use the Kindle fire with this product.
034580404X|5.0|Very intense books. Very Erotic. It is helpful if you have some knowledge of BDSM and how the dominant and submissive rolls are played out. I enjoyed the books. I am half way through the second book. Cant wait to find out if she stays or leaves the relationship.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|I don't know why I didn't watch this until recently, but I'm glad I finally did.<br /><br />The premise is weird, it follows Amanda Price a sweet modern woman who loves &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34;. Then one day in her bathroom she discovers Elizabeth Bennet. At first Amanda thinks it's a dream, but soon Elizabeth shows Amanda a door in her bathroom that leads to that other world set 200 years ago.<br /><br />Amanda steps inside, directly into the hall of the Bennet house, when suddenly the door connecting the two worlds closes shut. So she is stuck in the world of Elizabeth Bennet.<br /><br />What I liked about this series are the unexpected twists. I liked how all the characters grew throughout the story. I really liked Mr. Wickham in this version. I loved Mr Darcy as he grew throughout the series, he was also the handsomest Darcy I have seen yet. I liked how most of the characters got their HEA by learning to follow their heart, and to shed unfair prejudices and rules. I was glad that Amanda Price got her happy ending too, I was rooting for her. Last but not least, I enjoyed the comedic approach.<br /><br />The one drawback is that the ending felt rushed. They should have added a scene with a montage showing snippets of everyone's life, after they ended up with who they wanted. I also wished they had given Mr. Wickham a love interest.<br /><br />In the end this was a charming mini-series, a new twist on Pride and Prejudice...funny and romantic

B005ZOBNOI|3.0|It was a good book but not really my type.  It was reccommended by a friend.  A little too dark for me.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great story. Fun to read. Easy to imagine and goes along in a lovely pace. Have fun, kickback  and enjoy.<br /><br />If anyone is looking for a D/s starter kit or how to find and marry a billionare,  this is your book. And i also have a speak and spell that commuicates with other galaxies that is equelly helpful in that presuit. Good luck.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I thought this book was amazing.  I could not put it down.  Very emotional. I hoped it would not end the way it did.  It was a well written book on a controversial topic
0470913029|5.0|This is a good foundation for starting to live a more healthy lifestyle. It helps you see why this way of eating is good for you. I lost about 40 lbs and my aches and pains have gone away. There is a down side. You will need to buy at least one to two sizes smaller than you are currently wearing, because your clothes will look like you borrowed them from your older and bigger brother or sister. You definitely do not starve yourself and the spices you will use make eating your veggies a new and better experience. Your taste buds will be awakened.
B007SGM084|5.0|I probably haven't read a book in over 12 years but everyone keep talking about this book so I had to see what the hype was about and boy was it worth it! I got into the book within the first chapter and kept me wanting more!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This app makes spider fun and easy. It has settings to make playing more enjoyable. Definitely worth getting. Its free! Better than playing on a computer.

B0078ZYXSA|1.0|Goodness me, this album is laughable.  I bought it after reading generally good reviews, and after being a long time DMR fan.  But, I'm struggling to match the positive reviews I read to the comically-bad album I purchased.  The lyrics are poor and Rowland's singing is generally dismal.  If I were to come home drunk from the pub, sit on the toilet and pick up a microphone, it would basically sound the same as this album.  Meandering, self-absorbed nonsense.  Bye Kevin - I'm done with you.
0307951529|1.0|Want to know the two secrets to creating a profitable, independent business?<br /><br />1. Work a six figure corporate job for ten to fifteen years and have tens of thousands of dollars in savings.<br />2. Make sure your entire social circle is comprised of wealthy and influential businessmen.<br /><br />Guillebeau seems to be oblivious to the ridiculous nature of this scenario as he relates story after story of lawyers, executives, and high commission salesmen that escaped the hell of wealth and financial security for a more simple life. Over and over again he references their six figure salaries and how miserable their jobs made them.<br /><br />I read about 75% of the book when I stopped reading. The story that put me over the edge was about a woman that needed $900 immediately for some event at South by South West. According to Guillebeau, no less than three people at the event came to her rescue, each offering her the money without question. What reality does this book take place in? Look at your social circle and ask how many people have $900 to spare, then ask yourself how many of these people would you just happen to run into at a music festival on the other side of the country?<br /><br />At no point are mortgages, insurance, medical bills or emergency funds addressed. What if your water heater dies the same week your transmission breaks? I guess You're supposed to rely on that nest egg you built as a successful lawyer.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I loved the book and I can't wait for the next one , \\"Silo 17\\" hopefully.<br />Great story line if a little slow sometimes but worth it.

0345528581|4.0|--and the results are pretty good.  Unlike  most of the negative reviewers, who are quibbling over the author's nutrional ideas or whether or not it's fair to use household implements and still call it bodyweight training, I've actually done the program for a while and I like it.  I'm fairly advanced at this type of training but, coming off a long-ish layoff and with the injury that caused the layoff still limiting me, I chose the intermediate level program in You Are Your Own Gym.  It worked pretty well.<br /><br />My big question about the book going in was its use of divided routines* (For those new to this type of training, I'll define this and other terms at the bottom of the review).  It's been a decade or more since I've done these, having decided, definitively, that full body workouts, done in a traditional 3-times-a-week,L-M-H program** worked better, at least for me.  But Lauren's book (and my injury) gave me reason to reconsider.  My hope was that the divided routines in YAYOG would, at my current age (47) and level of fitness (not what I once was), promote better recovery and, thus, better gains.  Has that been the case?  Yes, I think perhaps it has.  I still feel weird coming out of a workout with only half of my body tired and, again, the layoff and injury make direct comparisons difficult but overall, I'm ready to pat myself on the back, declare victory, and move on.  Of course, you could take the exercises in YAYOG and re-arrange them into full-body workouts.<br /><br />How does You Are Your Own Gym compare with other books in this category?  Pretty well, I think.  In recent years, I've also done Pavel Tsatsouline's The Naked Warrior, Paul Wade's Convict Conditioning, and Brooks Kubik's Dinosaur Bodyweight Training.  YAYOG definitely rates higher than Naked Warrior, which is too narrowly focused to be useful for most people. It's also much better than Convict Conditioning, the author of which insists that periodization*** isn't necessary for bodyweight training.  I think he's wrong about that.  So does Mark Lauren, who does a great job with periodization in YAYOG.  In fact, it's probably the best thing about the book.  Dinosaur Bodyweight Training was, until I picked up YAYOG, the clear category winner for me.  The workouts are harder than the ones in YAYOG (in most cases, much harder) and more dedicated to strength than conditioning.  But YAYOG has served a definite purpose for me and would, I think, for others as well.  So call it a draw between these two, with YAYOG better for beginners and the Dinosaur book a winner for advanced trainees.  Women, I think, would mostly prefer YAYOG.<br /><br />Before I define the above asterisked terms, let me say one thing to anyone new to this type of exercise: if terms like these make your eyes glaze over and your teeth ache, don't worry about it.  You can train for a long time, years probably, making steady gains, without knowning any of these things.  It's only advanced trainees who have to get crafty to keep coaxing gains out of their bodies and by the time you reach that stage, you'll be hooked, reading everything you can find, gobbling up the jargon.<br /><br />*Divided routines--in this case, doing lower body work on one day, upper body the next.  There are other ways to divide but that's the way this book does it.  The theory is that, not working the same parts two workouts in a row, you'll recover better and thus make better gains.  Sometimes it works that way.<br /><br />**3 times a week, L-M-H--the gold standard workout of strength training.  In this regimen you choose 3-6 exercises, usually one per movement (a fairly standard routine would be: one upper body push, one upper body pull, one squat variation, one lower back exercise and one abdominal exercise) and you work them all in each workout, training three times a week, with one Light, one Medium, and one Heavy session.  You can vary the weight used or, in the case of calisthenics, the difficulty of the exercises used, to achieve this variety, the difference between Light, Medium, and Heavy, but, more typically (and usually more effectively), the same weights and/or exercises are used and the sets and reps are varied instead.  Most trainees find that keeping the sets constant as well, varying only the reps, is most effective.<br /><br />***Periodization, in its simplest definition, means varying the difficulty of your workouts, not going all-out every time. The above L-M-H program is one way of doing this.  There are dozens of others.  However you do it--and, again, Lauren does a great job with periodization in You Are Your Own Gym--you do have to do it.  Going all-out, lifting your heaviest weights for the most reps all the time, leads first to plateau-ing, then burnout (both physical and mental) and, then, if you're persistent enough about it, to injury.  And it doesn't matter whether the weight you're lifting is a barbell or your own body, the same rules apply.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am so happy I found this series!  So well written and engaging!  It was such a surprise and really just incredible.  The turn of phrase and metaphors pulled me right in.  I highly recommend this dark, hopeful, suspenseful, highly imaginative and well thought out story.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I gave into the hype and was sadly dismayed. The book is just foolish. The main character is laughably naive. On what planet does a 23 year old graduate college and not have an email address? It is inconceivable to think she did not have a computer of her own prior to Grey. I had to go back to the beginning to see what year this was supposed to be because a Blackeberry and laptop were awe inspiring things from the future. Really? A rucksack? Oh gosh! Yes, the dialogue is banal. I wish I could have kept count as to how many times her breath hitched. For interest sake please gasp, groan or catch your breath for a change. The sex was not erotic it was comical. There was absolutely nothing about this book that is worth your time or money. I am mad at myself for buying into it. I am saddened that this level of trash is a best seller. I fear for our intellect if this is considered a great read. There are plenty of easy, fun, yet well written reads out there, this is definitely not one of them.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very interesting and suspensefull,a must read for all married or about to be married! Grabs your attention from page one, a can't put down book. Thought provoking,you aren't sure about anything right to the end.

0441013597|5.0|I still have my well-thumbed copy of Dune from when I first read it in the eighties. The first installment of the epic series grabbed hold of my imagination in a way few science fiction books ever had.<br /><br />The series is fantastically detailed, but the power of Frank Herbert is in his grasp of the esoteric, the mystical, and the way he weaves it into the world that is Dune.<br /><br />This is more than just a timeworn story of a noble child caught in a dynastic fight between houses--this is a story of a boy grappling with a supernatural destiny, with no way of escaping from it. Herbert brings the character of Paul Atreides to life against a panoply of supporting characters. All very well done and highly recommended.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I enjoyed the love story between Abby and Travis. Their relationship was definitely a beautiful disaster. I struggled with the violence that was peppered throughout. I get that it helped solidify Travis' bad boy status but it went overboard and often made me uncomfortable. The author did well in depicting the emotional rollercoaster of the relationship. I think that the book was worth the read. I would recommend it for those in their very early 20's.
B007B8EX9I|5.0|I am waiting for season 3 to be available in Amazon. I managed to see only one episode every sitting for the season 1st and part of season 2. Last night I just indulged myself and watched the last four.  The quality in acting, scenery and the details of the stories are incredible.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book is not only a must read for those who are introverts and need valIdation but also for those with children who are introverts and for anyone in the teaching profession. In an age when collaboration is seen as the only legitimate way to learn and solve problems, it is imperative that teachers understand that not all children can, or should, be part of this trend. Totally enlightening, easy to read, and well researched.
0062206281|5.0|THE PRISONER OF HEAVEN is set after THE SHADOW OF THE WIND. Daniel and Bea are married and have an infant son. Sempere & Sons has seen better days, but is still hanging on when a mysterious customer arrives and purchases a rare copy of Dumas' COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO. Lo and behold, the copy is intended as a gift for Fermin. Daniel is skeptical of the transaction and quickly closes up shop, following the man through the city streets in hopes of discovering something to support or disprove his gut feeling that something strange is going on. When Daniel confronts Fermin over the issue, he learns that his old friend is hiding some very strange secrets in his past. And those secrets concern Daniel as well.<br /><br />I should warn you that you definitely need to read both THE SHADOW OF THE WIND and ANGEL'S GAME before diving into THE PRISONER OF HEAVEN. It's been long enough since reading its predecessors that even I've had a bit of a time reacquainting myself with the characters and the overarching storyline. Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed returning to Spain and Sempere & Sons. THE PRISONER OF HEAVEN was a fabulous addition to the series! Word has it that Zafon has intended this to be a four parter, in which case I will be waiting in great anticipation to see what comes next!

B004T4KQJS|4.0|This book was an interesting read. I could tell Lawrence was trying to make his version of The God Delusion or The Greatest Show On Earth, but I don't think it quite turned out that way. The problem is the concepts are too huge. I'm a layman when it comes to physics, so these ideas need some more explanation. The book is pretty okay, but bring a highlighter. It's not a light read.

B007CI81IQ|5.0|Public debate about the way to combat global poverty has ricocheted between two extremes. One was summed up in 2005 in The End of Poverty by Jeffrey Sachs, the Columbia economist who spearheaded the UN Millennium Development Goals. The other was laid out by former World Bank economist William Easterly the following year in The White Man's Burden. Sachs advocates massive government-to-government foreign aid. Easterly deplores foreign aid, convinced that it does more harm than good.<br /><br />In Poor Economics, Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo seek a path between these two extremes, emphasizing the Randomized Controlled Studies they and their colleagues had conducted to ascertain what works and what doesn't. (As of 2010, they had completed more than 240 studies in forty countries around the world.)They characterize Easterly's approach as demand-driven, since he believes that poor people must seek their own solutions -- a conservative, free-market attitude. By contrast, Sachs' approach is supply-driven, reflecting Sachs' conviction that a government must provide for its people based on consensus thinking about what poor people need -- a liberal, top-down attitude. (I find myself bemused that I'm on the right side of this debate.)<br /><br />Banerjee and Duflo report that their observations and research results support each of these two approaches -- and sometimes both -- depending on what issue they study. Hunger, health, education, financial services, family planning, business development, policy options: each field offers up a unique picture of success and failure attributed to one or another of the two approaches. In other words, circumstances and details matter, all of which may vary from one country to another. There is no silver bullet, they assert, no panacea to eliminate poverty.<br /><br />Poor Economics focuses on the overarching question of whether there is such a thing as a \\"poverty trap.\\" Sachs contends there is: poor people will be stuck in poverty unless and until they are given the resources to release themselves from the trap. In many circumstances, Banerjee and Duflo find scant evidence to support this assertion. In others, however, they see the need for government intervention in the lives of the poor because otherwise they will perceive no reason to act for themselves.<br /><br />Rather than identifying a simple, unitary explanation why Sachs' approach often fails, they emphasize \\"ideology, ignorance, and inertia -- the three I's -- on the part of the expert, the aid worker, or the local policy maker.\\" These three I's, they claim, \\"often explain why policies fail and why aid does not have the effect it should.\\" Banerjee and Duflo explain further: \\"The poor often resist the wonderful plans we think up for them because they do not share our faith that those plans work, or work as well as we claim.\\"<br /><br />It would be difficult to find two scholars better prepared than Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo to forge a middle course through the opposite poles of thought about global poverty erected by Jeffrey Sachs and William Easterly. Banerjee, an Indian economist who is also the son of two economists, holds an endowed chair in economics at MIT. He co-founded MIT's Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab with Duflo, a French economist and a former MacArthur Fellow (recipient of the \\"genius\\" award).<br /><br />For anyone who seeks deeper understanding of global poverty and the ways and means of fighting it, Poor Economics is must reading.

Would I be as brave as Katniss was? Could I kill someone to survive?<br /><br />This book was amazing. I absolutely loved it and could not wait to snatch up the next two to find out what President Snow was going to do, what the repercussions of what Katniss and Peeta did at the end...?<br /><br />Excellent, excellent, excellent!
B00846REIS|4.0|I entered the world of erotic novels thru the 50 Shades triology and I was immediately hooked. When someone recommended Bared to You I was in such withdraw I went for it. I was pleasantly surprised and happily I liked it more than 50 Shades. Not only is the writing/vocabulary better, the storyline is much better too. My only complaint is the wait for book 2. However, I will patiently wait for much more of Gideon Cross!

B007L3BMGA|3.0|I am a true lover of the twilight series, which I read all of within a week. I dont like that fifty shades is compared to the twilight series because in my opinion they are really not in the same league. This is a good enough read to get through the book but it is written very badly. It may be on the best sellers list but certainly on the best writers list and i think the only reason it is on best sellers is because of all the hype from the sex scenes. I only read it because i wanted to know what all the fuss was about. By the second book i hardly read the sec scenes, skipping over them as they were so incredibly boring after the inital \\"oh my goodness is this really the book i gave my mother in law to read!?\\" shock.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This review is my general opinion of the movie and a response to another persons review. I personally thought that the movie was amazing in every aspect, the action, effects, and oddly enough, humor. this is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time, my mother hated all of the other superhero movies leading up to The Avengers ( except for Iron Man ) and she loved The Avengers. And to one of the people who wrote a negative review about this movie, the one who said Frosty The Snowman was better, I respect your opinion and I am sorry that you lost your brother's co-workers family in 9/11 but the thing is you have to understand that people are going to keep making movies with explosions in New York, and that this franchise is much more than Marvel trying to \\" make a buck \\", because if Marvel was trying to \\" make a buck \\" they would not be making a movie that cost $250,000,000 to make plus 5 movies before that. Also The Avengers is the 3rd highest grossing film of all time and the fastest movie to reach the milestone $300,000,000 in the U.S.  which by the way was 9 days. In this review if you are even reading it is not to offend you or upset you and I am deeply sorry for your loss and mean no disrespect by this review/reply, this was just for the purpose of explaining to you that this was not to \\" make a quick buck \\" and that it was a very successful, entertaining, and overall excellent movie. I do respect your opinion, you are entitled to think what you want and this is what I thought. I would have made this a comment on your review but my phone would only let me do reviews. To the people reading this as a review, I simply think that everybody even the people who don't like superhero movies should see this movie at least once and see what they think.

B000TO0T4O|4.0|I like the fact that most of the story is a fact or a real thing. The stories are so fast in action, I can't put them down. And with my Kendle I go through three stories before I know it. I don't like the swearing and meanness that is in most adult stories. Yet these Alex Rider, stories teach and expand your mind.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|If your a hard core Alien fan like me then I would highly consider the Anthology over the Quadrilogy. The whole reason why I prefer the Anthology vs. the Quadriolgy is strictly because I have a Blu-Ray DVD player and I really think that these classic movies (not including Alien Ressurection) really deserves the Blu-Ray treatment they deserve. If your one of those people that believe that there is no reason to spend the extra money for Blu-Ray that's fine the Quqdrilogy is the Anthology's equivalent but in DVD format. If you only own a standard DVD player and don't really want to upgrade then go with the Quadrilogy or even if you still want the movies and just want to save a little bit of money then defiantly go with the Quadrilogy. Ether way you can't go wrong with the amount of bonus materials that's on these two sets. It's just all personal preference on if you want the Blu-Ray or the DVD's.

0307951529|5.0|There's always a more perfect time in your life that you wish you had read the books that cross your path. This is how I fel about The $100 Startup - I wish I had read it - or rather, I wish Chris had written it - about 5 years ago when I was still stumbling around, lost and confused and disillusioned with Corporate America, and beyond discouraged about doing anything I could love. The Corporate America culture is brilliant at shunning any ideas of creativity and innovation and certainly not encouraging in anyway to those who want to strike out on their own. If someone had told me just how POSSIBLE it is for any of us to start our own thriving and profitable microbusiness would be - NOT EASY but POSSIBLE - I would have jumped at the chance. So while I found a lot of this information in this book to be familiar - I know that it serves as an ideal resource for those who are new to entrepreneurship today. I felt fortunate to know about 70% of the wonderful individuals in the case studies, and having been around the blogosphere for a while now, I echo Chris Guillebeau's heart-filled approach to starting a business and doing something you can love. Chris lives his words. He is a genuinely well-meaning success story, and I love that he chose to share this. The stories CAN happen to you, if you choose to believe and to do and to give yourself a real chance. I'll be recommending this to my Smart Exit Blueprint class and writing up a more extensive review at my blog on Prolific Living. Enjoy and as Tony Robbins says, Live with Passion! :)

0425263908|5.0|Since I've read all 3 Fifty Shades, I needed something else to fill my void. Bared To You did the job! I finished Bared To You within a week since I bought it on Amazon. I'm really looking forward to Reflected In You in October, because at the end of the first book, I'm left hanging for more!!! There are similarities in both Bared To You and Fifty Shades, but what's great about them is that they have their own story. I'm def. in love with Gideon and Eva and I def. recommend this book if you loved Fifty Shades!!
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I have this on my tablet and I have downloaded 5 free tracks from Amazon Mp3 site and have uploaded some to it cloud player too
B005M2A4D4|5.0|This is honestly one of the greatest shows on TV right now. The head writer, Steven Moffat, is a genius, and the story arc he has created for this Doctor is mind blowing. There are so many times when you really just don't know what's going to happen, and it's exhilarating. This season also featured some fantastic episodes not written by Moffat, and after this season everyone was able to see what I saw in Rory Williams (seriously, he becomes so cool). You love all the characters, and Matt Smith continues to do an amazing job as the greatest portrayal of the Doctor thus far.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Its a good game yet I don't like how its different and everything from WMW.  It is also A little short. I Wouldn't cost it 99&cent; I would say 50&cent; or Free.<br />Its quite fun so If you like it spend a Dollar :]
B0083EM24C|5.0|This album is so intentional, and really lets you into the mind of lead singer, Michael Angelicko. He's a deeply troubled person, and you can hear it in his lyrics, but the music oddly enough is still as upbeat and fun to dance to as any pop music. I found this album to be much catchier, and more comprehensible than Manners, and I think you will get the vibe that the band has really come into their own with this album, completely mastering their sound.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|I love this album. There is amazing production behind it, and Springsteen has released his best album of the 2000s (with The Rising and Magic at 2nd and 3rd.) This album is definitely in springsteen's top 10.  The top 5 tracks on the album are<br /><br /> 1. Shackled and Drawn<br /> 2. Death To my Hometown<br /> 3. Easy Money<br /> 4. Jack Of All Trades<br /> 5. We Take Care of our Own.<br /><br />Some people will tell you that this album is Pop garbage, and that springsteen has lost his touch. I think this album rocks harder than most in 2012. Springsteen has not lost his touch, in fact, he's as good as he's been in a while. Buy this album, you will not be disappointed.

B000SEI230|3.0|This is a Nicholas Sparks book. I love his writing and have read many of his books. This is one that I could have passed on. My teenage granddaughter loved it and told me I had to read it. For her age, it is a good read. The author's best book is the one about him traveling with his brother around the world. It is non-fiction and the best he has done.
0345494768|4.0|J.W. Rinzler's The Making of Star Wars isn't so much a book about the making as much as it is a collection of primary materials and documentation about the making, including copious interviews, photos, and scans of original documents. It's great for dedicated Star Wars fans and is (and will be) a treasure for historians. However, the text itself is pretty dry and is mostly a straight retelling of what happened, when and where. Rinzler uses primary interviews to tell much of the story and it's great to hear the voices of the men and women involved in making the movie.<br /><br />However, because the book tries to be a comprehensive chronological retelling, that means it jumps around and never really presents a single narrative. For example, a chapter might discuss negotiations between Lucas and the studios, McQuarrie's conceptual drawings, ILM's troubles designing the Falcon, and the latest rewrite of the script. This makes it difficult to follow something like the development of the story because it's all spread out, although Rinzler does sometimes include helpful boxes reminding readers about significant changes thus far.<br /><br />Overall, this book is a treasure and valuable resource, but it's not necessarily the book you're looking for if you just want to learn more about the making of the film. If you just want to learn about the development of the script and story, I highly recommend [[ASIN:0978465237 The Secret History of Star Wars]], which presents a story almost as exciting as the films themselves. I recommend reading that book first, and then reading Rinzler's book to transport yourself back in history to hear the voices and see the images of how the galaxy far, far away came into being.
B0055PMJMW|5.0|I love Michael Connolly's Harry Bosch stories. This book has three short stories that will keep you in suspense. I love mysteries, as I try to guess the outcome. It is hard to do with Mr. Connolly's books. I highly recommend all his books.

B000001EGE|5.0|All of the songs play very well, and have distinct sounds. The entire CD plays like brand new. I liked to get the CD when I needed it and it arrived on time
B000XA5K48|4.0|This is a fun film to watch. It is filled, more than any other film I saw, with unbelievable shooting, one man against dozens of professional hit men. The sheer impossibility of the shootings and of the other actions in the film makes this film into a parody, fun. The hero is sitting eating a carrot when the film begins. Since the film is filled with shootings, it is rather remarkable that he has no gun, at this time. He sees a man apparently trying to kill a pregnant woman. He intervenes and kills him by stabbing him with a carrot. He is then chased by many armed men. When he kills them all, the head man of the chasers hires another fifty, yes fifty. Beside the fun, we wonder who this man is, who is the woman he joins up with, why are the gunmen after the baby that the pregnant woman give birth to.
B005FITIGO|5.0|Five-stars from me!  This is a film for people who aren't afraid to think while watching a movie. Don't be put off by the subject matter, it's very watchable and straight forward in the way the writers, actors and director tell this all-too-realistic fictionalized account of a key event leading up to the financial melt-down of 2008. The script keeps legal and financial jargon to a minimum but manages to explain key concepts without slowing down the pace.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading all the other excellent reviews, but one person said this film would never be known for some cliche line or catch phrase, I disagree; Kevin Spacey summed it all up nicely in one short line early in the film:  \\"Is that figure right?\\"
0385738773|2.0|*** warning: this review contains spoilers ***<br />Although I did not love The Scorch Trials (book 2), I waited impatiently for The Death Cure because I was eager to have questions answered. Let's recap some of the questions I had at the end of Book 2:<br />Why would Tom and Theresa subject themselves and other children to these horrible trials?<br />How much of what we are learning is real vs lies vs fabricated memories?<br />Is WICKED really good?<br />What is really happening in the outside world?<br /><br />The last question was answered. The others, no so much. Unlike the first two books which were plotted pretty tightly and pulled me along, this book got off to a slow start. It took me 2 weeks to read the first 120 pages and I almost abandoned the book.<br /><br />There were plot holes. While half of the characters got their memories back... no discussion ever happened between the character that did or didn't that provided any insight into the motivations and methods of Wicked. The relationship between Thomas and Theresa led nowhere. So much so that when &lt;spoiler>Theresa died&lt;/spoiler> there was virtually no mention of the event or &lt;spoiler>mourning&lt;/spoiler>.<br /><br />At the end of 3 books I still feel like I know nothing about Thomas, Theresa, Brenda, Minho, and Newt. I don't mourn those that died. I didn't cheer for the deus-ex-machina ending. &lt;spoiler>Not everything is better with portals&lt;/spoiler>.<br /><br />I started reading this series because my son's reading teacher recommended it and my son read the first chapter and didn't like it. When my son asks if he should give this series a second chance, I will tell him to give it a pass.
145168939X|1.0|I kept reading this book that I borrowed from the library, because I thought it might get better. It didn't. I finally gave up shortly after the halfway point. This book is just awful. It is disjointed to the point that it is difficult to follow. It feels like I'm reading something with pages missing. The worst thing is that there is no compelling reason to finish reading it. It is boring, and I have a lot of patience. (I read Jane Eyre, and Great Expectations.) I can't imagine how the movie about the same thing is going to be any more interesting than this drivel.  I wonder who greenlit this for a screenplay. Then they complain that movie watching is down. People aren't going to theaters because nothing good is playing.
034580404X|3.0|I must say, it's not as titilating as my friends told me it was. Also, the relationship portrayed within is simply not a healthy example of the kind of erotic play being described. I would place this trilogy on the same shelf as many many romance novels that have fallen short of expectations. The writing is not easy to wade through, as I kept hearing George Takei saying \\"Oh My\\" in some instances, and there were several paradoxes regarding the main character's abilities when juxtaposed with her experience.<br /><br />SO, in a nutshell- eh. I've read better. What's so great about this?
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Very good story about a young girl trying to survive the foster care system.  How she learns to make her way in the world and slowly opens up her heart to find love.
B007ZKY7XO|5.0|As a whole, this is probably not the band's best work & certainly not their most cohesive.  But when you factor in the infectiousness of about half of the songs here, you realize it is yet another crucial must-have.  The funky, John Legend collaboration \\"Baby Come Home\\" is totally irresistible and a wise choice for a second single.  \\"Only The Horses\\", with nice production from Calvin Harris, is a thoughtful, dancefloor classic in the making.  Silly party romps like \\"Let's Have A Kiki\\", \\"Shady Love\\" & \\"F*** Yeah\\" demonstrate Jake Shears' comedic, white-boy rapping skills & make a perfect soundtrack for a night of going out on the town.  For fans looking for something a little deeper, ballads like \\"Year Of Living Dangerously\\" & \\"Secret Life Of Letters\\" recall earlier work like \\"Return To Oz\\", from their debut album.  The grab-bag of genres here and the band's apparent love of 90's club sounds makes Magic Hour a bit spotty- but the good outweighs the filler & and half of these tracks are must-haves for ANY party playlist!
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|I was looking forward to seeing this movie.  I am sorry to say that I was disappointed.  There was some good scary moments but I did not like the ending.  I think it could have been made better.  I am glad that I did not spend the money at the movies.
B004ZNAXX2|5.0|Look i am NOT a fevered PINK FLOYD fan... I have always had a respect for them and have been familiar with their catalog... I have friends who love them so i have seen and heard most of their even obscure material... This collection features another remaster of THE WALL right, no big deal, a nice mix... But the DEMOs are a gem... WATERS idea of 'demo' seem really polished...  DVD nothing mind blowing but nice interviews and behind the wall stuff.., then u still have the books and concept sketches... And MARBLES? Does anyone take them out of the box?  Anyways. THE BOX was well worth the cost and i was happy to open the package... My first IMMERSION BOX but seriously considering the other two now...  Couldn't recommend this set more...  If u even see this review then obviously u want:NEED: this box! Go ahead SPLURGE! U seldom will be rewarded as much as this set..,
B001BC5HXG|5.0|Starts off slow, ends so well. A coming of age/loss of innocence story that goes full circle..twice. A great balance of good, evil, and everything in between.
B0001O3YD0|4.0|Very original story about a planet with 3 Suns and a coming eclipse to become the mother of all eclipses. Excellent original story and well played out with great special effects. You have to get past some of the non human creatures looking a lot like Predator but other than that a good movie.
B007JOM7C4|4.0|I was already familiar with a few of her songs from this album but I ended up liking most. A lot of these tracks are now in my workout playlist as they have a great beat to walk, jog, or dance to.
B007SGM084|2.0|I didn`t like this book at all, but I do not regret buying it, since I wouldn`t have known if I didn`t, such a promoted book could be so pathetic. The style of the writing is so unprofessional, so repetitive, so obvious and you will find cliches all over the book. It finally ends up being boring and ridiculous. Fifty shades of Grey has an extreme sexual subject with a writing style that would better suit a teenager audience, not to mention the similarity to the Twilight characters and story, without supernatural creatures... A complete waste of money.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|All I want to say is OMG it was awesome and I couldn't put it down...<br />My husband now also wants to thanks Mr and Mrs Grey...<br />read it ladies its the best
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|What was Gemma think. Why would she sit on the coach after shooting that girl. I hate Agent June Stahl. She needs to die already!!!! I think it is crazy that so many people who were there since the beginning are dead already. I thought they would be in the movie for a long time. This is a great movie. Husband and I can't wait to start season three.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|Even if you're not a Twihard you will love this CD, all songs are great. If you put this on can hear it over and over and never tire of it. That's a great investment to me.
B0060AY6FO|5.0|Great fun to read this book especially after \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". The author, P.D. James did a good job of keeping the Jane Austin style as close as she could. It was kind of nice to see what developed in the lives of Elizabeth and Darcy and her sisters. Was like a sequel. If you like Jane Austin you certainly want to read this book.

0143034901|3.0|To say that Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n's The Shadow of the Wind was an international success is an understatement.  The novel has been published in at least 20 countries and was a number one bestseller in Spain, the author's home country.  Part gothic novel, part romance novel, it is an ambitious story of almost 500 pages that blends several genres in a way guaranteed (in theory) to appeal to a variety of readers.  Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n seems to be appealing to readers that enjoy mysteries, coming-of-age novels, fantasy, historical fiction, intensely atmospheric settings, books about books, or even (perhaps, especially) television soap operas.  A complete willingness to toss aside one's sense of disbelief is mandatory with this one.  All of that is well and good, but it is also a bit risky because it only works if readers do not also dislike some of the elements in the blend.<br /><br />The book's first person narrator, Daniel Sempere, is ten years old when the story begins in 1950s Barcelona.  When young Daniel panics that he is forgetting his deceased mother's face, his bookstore-owning father decides to distract him by introducing Daniel to the \\"Cemetery of Forgotten Books,\\" an underground storage facility where single copies of such books are preserved.  Daniel is encouraged to remove one book from the vast library, a book for which he will be forever responsible from that moment onward.  He chooses a novel by Juli&aacute;n Carex called The Shadow of the Wind.<br /><br />Daniel takes his role seriously and decides to find copies of the other books Carex wrote before his violent death on the streets of Barcelona in 1936.  He is horrified to learn, however, that the books are impossible to locate because a horribly disfigured man supposedly has been buying them for years with the sole purpose of destroying them.  Determined to protect the Carex book in his possession, Daniel becomes obsessed with learning everything he can about Juli&aacute;n Carex.  When this mysterious book-burner learns that Daniel owns a copy of The Shadow of the Wind, Daniel's life - along with that of his father and closest friends - is placed in jeopardy unless he agrees to sell his book to the fiend.<br /><br />Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n tells his tale via two timelines, one involving the personal history of Juli&aacute;n Carex and one describing Daniel's present day effort to discover the truth about Carex's death.  As the similarities between the two timelines become more and more evident, the mystery surrounding Daniel's nemesis goes in and out of focus several times before the man's identity and motive for destroying the Carex books are finally revealed.  It is a long and winding path - one that involves an assembly of characters and villains in both timelines.<br /><br />My problem with The Shadow of the Wind is a \\"technical\\" one.  I am always willing to suspend my sense of disbelief when I enjoy a story, allowing an author plenty of room to use coincidence and clich&eacute; to move a plot forward, as is certainly the case here.  What made reading The Shadow of the Wind a chore for me was the author's insistence on slowing the pace to a near halt several times by inserting secondhand accounts of action that had taken place \\"off stage.\\"  When I realized the memories being recounted by the book's characters contained a level of detail - and facts - that the immediate speaker had no way of knowing (either at the time of the actual events or in the present), I began to dread losing my reading momentum to them.  Not only does this literary device not work, it lessens the impact of the rest of the book and is simply a lazy way to tell a story.<br /><br />That said, the book does contain one of my favorite passages of all time regarding books and readers:<br /><br /> Every book, every volume you see here has a soul.  The soul of the person who wrote it and those who read it and lived and dreamed with it.  Every time a book changes hands, every time someone runs his eyes down it pages, its spirit grows and strengthens.<br /><br />That thought makes me happy.rengthens.<br /><br />That thought makes me happy.
0345529057|5.0|No problem with the binding although each book is very thick, the print is not too small and you can keep on reading for hours, no matter how weak your sight is..<br />...and you keep on reading until the small hours.. enthralling..! If you are a fan of heroic fantasy, have spent years reading and re-reading Tolkien and S. Donaldson,read a Song of Ice and Fire! (although it is totally different, more grating than poetic.. ( more realistic, human?!!)<br />' Winter's coming', my dear..!!Pretty little silly birds are bound to freeze and die in this pitiless world !
0345803485|1.0|I have never written a review before in my life, but for this book, I feel compelled to warn potential readers to NOT read this novel. I am two-thirds of the way through the first book and it was a struggle just to get to this point. Before I read the book, I had no idea that it was Twilight fan fiction. After I found this out, the entire novel makes complete sense. All the annoying characteristics (and characters in general) I found in Twilight, match the ones found in Fifty Shades of Grey. The main character, Ana, spoke and acted as if she was in middle school the entire book. As someone who plans on interning at a publishing house, it should be in her best interest to express her feelings in phrases other than \\"jeez,\\" \\"that's so hot,\\" and \\"double crap.\\" Ana also seems to suffer from multiple personality disorder as she has her subconscious and \\"inner goddess\\" act out roles in the book as well. Christian Grey is just an all around red flag and whoever actually encounters someone like him in real life should run far away. And preferably never use a computer or your cell phone because he will track your device and follow you there. In no world should stalking be considered attractive. This \\"romance\\" is really just abusive both emotionally and physically. Through this entire book, Ana clearly is frightened by Christian and doesn't want to partake in most of the torturous sex. If someone makes you sign a legal document before you have sex with them, it is probably a good idea to leave as soon as possible. Ana is scared of Christian, has to watch what she says around him, can't have a social life, and she makes yet another great idea and stays with him. I can't bring myself to finish the last third of the book because every character in it is a crazy moron. I'm sure that it will be filled with many angry conversations about eating food, turning shades of crimson, fighting with her other personalities, magical orgasms after being abused, and awkward old British Literature thrown about. OH MY!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|fun game. great graphics! really liked the auto fighting action, but it took me a long time to get past lvl 17 without purchasing in game content.
B007JWKLMO|3.0|Would have been worth renting, but not worth the $20 I spent. Not bad, but not as great as all of the pre-release hype and reviews, in my opinion. Anyway, see for yourself...
B007JOM0GC|5.0|It's like great song after great song. This album will be hard to top. Surprisingly, the price was a steal for this fantastic collection of songs.
B005GG0MIS|1.0|it keeps doing this on my kindle wifi touch.  I have latest software downloaded...<br /><br />this has only ever happened with this book.<br /><br />Other than the pain of using \\"go to\\" every fifteen minutes, it is a great book.<br /><br />What should I do.
B007K3JCAE|3.0|i had resisted the ultraviolet \\"digital copy\\" for quite some time but figured I'd try it out. what a hassle. after three registrations, finally got it to play on my ipad but the picture won't sync with the hdmi relay like every other digitial copy does. Blu-Ray quality is fine, like always, movie is what i expected, the ultraviolet just really is lame.
B004P7CN7W|5.0|I really liked The Faculty way back when it released and, after watching it again, I can say I really like this movie now. The Faculty has an alien invasion story (Invasion of the Body Snatchers is even mentioned in the film), where the aliens take over the bodies of a school faculty and the students. The few students that weren't \\"body snatched\\" team up and go after the queen. It has many elements of classic SciFi/Horror films; I particularly enjoyed the scene where they have to test who's an alien and who's not, and it plays out a lot like the blood testing scene in The Thing. The actual queen alien/monster isn't seen until the end, but the design was still great; the scene where it swims through the pool at full speed was thrilling. It packs plenty of thrills, a couple of scares, and great acting. As far as my opinion goes, I didn't see any significant flaws in the film.<br /><br />Overall, it's a fun, time-killing SciFi film that respects the classics. As of 8/6/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming.<br /><br />The Faculty has violence and gore, and nudity.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good book.  Much less expensive than buying it in hard cover in book store.More effort than using a hard cover, but worth it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Bad reviews??? I downloaded all 3 books on my tablet. After I read the book I thought it was a good book and I couldn't wait to read the 2nd book.  I don't think this book is hardcore.  Its R-rated but not a porno read type book. Anastasia is a strong woman who is very much outspoken and will speak her mind.  Anastasia helped Christian Grey through his darkness he went through in his past. Just like Twilight series of books I enjoyed it very much.

If I was E L James I'd be ready to duke it out with Sylvia Day for copying my book. I am 2/3 of the way through it and get more disgusted as I continue. I feel committed now as I'm so far into the book. The author has no shame! It doesn't have \\"similarities\\" to Fifty Shades, it IS Fifty Shades re-written and crammed into one book that doesn't even flow well. Fifty Shades was tedious at times but this is ridiculous. Tsk,tsk,tsk, Sylvia Day. Shame on you....but how does the old saying go? \\"imitation is the greatest form of flattery\\".....

Amazon provides pictures guiding you through the process of publishing with Amazon. It offers tips as well and suggestions to get you on your way, and it was free, need I say more! I just love Amazon!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|So many people say the book is all about its sexual content, but it is a lot more than that. The characters trap you and make you feel so many emotions. It is great to take your imagination to a whole other world! Great for entertainment purposes! Loved it!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I heard Hoda talk up this book and I downloaded it to my kindle,good start,builds up well,but the ending was awful!! I really could not understand how the author could not rap it up with a better ending.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put it down! It has so much mistery that I couldn't do anything else other than read this!!! And as soon as I was done, I was thankful I had it on my kindle to download the 2nd one right away!!! Loved it!!! And NO it is NOT all about the sexual parts!! It had a lot more MORE than that!!! :)
B007XNAOS0|1.0|I know why they called this the \\"Yellow and Green\\" album, because that is the color of vomit. This album made me sick such a disappointment. I hope their other color themed albums stay within their genre. Baroness, stop trying to be pop stars and concentrate on being METAL GODS!
B001CZVVVE|5.0|Usually I prefer a full opera, rather than medly of famous arias. The problem with a bunch of sweet arias is there is no emotional build up and rapport between audience and the performers. This is one exception.<br /><br />At the beginning, I had doubts how it will pan out. To the credit of producers and the singers, there actually was a gradually build up all the way to the end. It is highly entertaining and you get swept away by all four singers, although Netrebco often stole the show. It is a very very enjoyable performance.
