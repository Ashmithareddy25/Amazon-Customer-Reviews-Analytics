B003UESJFG|5.0|This is one kids movie that I absolutely love!! The cast is outstanding and its just a really fun movie! :)
0765325950|5.0|And it was an amazing ending. I am usually an ebook reader but I respect Mrs. Jordan and her husband 's legacy enough to be okay with not getting it on my kindle. It saddens but that this book has so many negative reviews over ebooks. These reviews are childish and doing nothing but disrespecting the late Robert Jordan.<br /><br />Now for the actual book, I started reading Eye of the World when I was 12 and now after 10 years I have closure. I would have liked to have a few more ends tied up, but we I understand why they left some out. I feel good about the ending. It's not necessarily a happy ending but it feels whole.  Thank you Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson for the chance of being a part of this world.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I really love to listened to Susan Boyle.  She has such a pure voice and the clairity is soothing.  I love all the Les Mes songs.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|I've liked the entire series. Card is original. I liked the idea of a Speaker for the Dead. I would rate a five except I thought the many &#34;family members&#34; were unnecessary, somewhat confusing, with some of them too one dimensional, stock character types.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is super fun and addicting. I love to play it on my kindle and it is super easy to learn
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I have been a fan of SK for many years.  In his work I have found friends and favorite nightmares, I have learned to see the world differently and I discovered that black and white will always blend into surprising shades of gray.<br /><br />Having said that, I have to tell you that I passed on 11/22/63 when it first came out, it just didn't push my buttons.  I only bought it because the price dropped.  I wish now that I had not waited, I should have trusted SK and done him the curtesey of paying full price.<br /><br /> 11/22/63 is many things...a love story, an epic time travel adventure, an interesting look at history...but above and beyond all of that it is a coming of age story.  I am of the same generation as the main character and our generation can exhibit an amazing level of immaturity compared to previous generations.  Through the act of time travel our \\"hero\\" learns about things that are bigger than self, about selfless sacrifice and about reality (the past resists change)...in short he grows up.<br /><br />Well worth reading, no matter the price.  This work shows a different side of SK and not everyone likes change but, in my opinion it is a must read.  I hope that those who don't ordinarily read SK (all those who aren't horror fans) take a chance and allow themselves to be transported by this great American novelist.
B004132HZS|5.0|As a huge fan of the books/stories (as well as the Granada series with Jeremy Brett), I was a bit skeptical. And then was hooked within the first 5 minutes.  Although updated, the show stays true to the original.  The writing, direction, production design and especially the acting are all sublime.  This is now my favorite screen adaptation of Holmes, and, IMHO, one of the best things ever put on screen, period.
0756404738|5.0|I can't wait to read day three now. This series has a hold of me that I can't shake. It's an amazing piece of work.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|This is the first youtube downloader I have gotten.No problems and its easy to download videos to my kindlefire or watch videos and music.I recamend from my personal stand point.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really find this game challengiing. Great fun! From the easiest getting progressively harder, its great. I recommend it to anyone.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|To start off, I didn't have any problems buying this book on my kindle touch. There wasn't any grey text, and I was able to read it to the end without my kindle crashing. Everyone finally meets one another. They travel to new places, meet, and fight new gods, and mythical creatures. Like Hercules and Arcanea the spider for an example. I can't wait for the next book to come out !
B000JQWH24|5.0|Previously bought this record on Amazon because I could not find it anywhere in stores. I'll admit I was skeptical about buying it online without seeing it first, but I figured it was only 20$ so I figured what the hay. I must say I am beyond pleased with my purchase.<br />It came long before the estimated delivery date. The record itself was in EXCELLENT condition. No scratches, scrapes or scuffs. It came with original lyric sheet. Sleeve was in EXCELLENT condition (there were maybe 2 folds on the whole surface). For something to be 30 years old this album was well kept.<br />Highly recommend this album to anyone who is a Michael fan, a lover of vinyl, or music enthusiast.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|WARNING: SPOILERS.<br />How do you improve upon perfection?  Darned if I know, but Moffat, Gatiss & company have done it with season 2.  I know there has been a lot of backlash against the way Irene Adler is written in \\"A Scandal in Belgravia,\\" but I saw her as an incredibly complex woman, one who is more than capable of taking on Sherlock intellectually, and THAT is the basis of the attraction between the two of them.  It's not about her being half-dressed or naked (which she does to throw him off, and succeeds), it's about 2 like minds meeting.<br /><br />My favorite overall is \\"The Hounds of Baskerville.\\"  A brilliant re-telling of the original.<br /><br />But my favorite scenes occur at the end of \\"The Reichenbach Fall.\\"  I teach acting, and I show my students these scenes as examples of the power of simplicity in performing.  They are breathtaking and heartbreaking, so be sure and have a tissue handy, lol!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I usually don't like musicals, BUT, my two daughters were watching this at their mom's house, and when I sat down and seen the last part of it, I just had to own it. Then, after seeing that there was no pre-recorded music in the movie, and that the actors and actresses had actually sung their parts.... I was totally amazed!! I TOTALLY recommend this movie to anyone that has even the slightest interest in music!!
B003Y5H5EW|3.0|( I did NOT purchase this movie on amazon.com - this is moreless a film review)<br /><br />This movie was okay. It wasn't nearly as good as the previous ones. In my opinion The Rise of the Lycans was the best, but I'm not a fan of how the story line went. The whole '12 year old being a hero and then getting captured again and then the hero going back to save the 12 year old'. I'm not a fan of the injection lycan blood( when you see it, you'll know what I mean). That's..I don't know. It's not supposed to be like that in my opinion. It's either get bit or nothing. Simple as that. Hopefully the 5th one will return to the 2nd and 3rd film roots. I'll have to wait about 2 or 3 years to find out though. Personally, I'd rent it unless you can find it for like 3 bucks somewhere.
B003204MQS|3.0|The quality of the streaming movie was great, however the movie itself was nothing that exciting. Definitely won't be seeing this one again.
031612057X|5.0|The Order was filled extremely fast. And Ms. D even gave me a discount because she felt the book was not as described.  I thought it was fine. But she gave me $ back. How flippin' honest is that?!  I'll use her again and again!!
B007HACDLK|4.0|My only criticism is that Mitch Rapp remains a fairly two-dimensional character in this story. However, the action scenes are the best in military fiction thrillers!--Donna Del Oro
B003O86FMW|3.0|I'm not sure, but it was way better than I anticipated!!! I almost didn't read this book or the first because  of the hype after the movie was made. Well worth my time.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|I'VE COLLECTED FROM THE BEGINNING , VINYL BOND SOUND TRACKS ,LOVED THE COVER POSTER ART ,this new skyfall ,has it chills ,with bond run hook , haven't heard in on airplay like we once would have , the cover art is cool in fact gr8 , do we have to wait 2 years for the next instalment
B001993Y3G|5.0|Arrived Instantly! A bluray movie for $9.99, who can complain?? Exactly as described, brand new, wrapped and all. Worked in my Bluray player with no problems. Legit item.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Not the best thing around but really cool axe movie the action scene are cool and story passes the time. I like the whole vampire idea but the whole president thing is kinda boring!
B00008S7KC|1.0|DVD will not play from the beginning have to start at a scene and rewind it then it will play..
B008UYQY4O|3.0|Debo reconocer que me dej&eacute; llevar por el t&iacute;tulo, me pareci&oacute; interesante e inteligente.<br />A&uacute;n cuando no es el tipo de libros que leo normalmente (mientras le&iacute;a, frecuentemente pensaba que a mi esposa le podr&iacute;a gustar)... me gust&oacute;... tal vez porque soy abuelo.
B006UUK612|4.0|The first time that I watched &#34;Flight of The Navigator&#34; was as a teenager in the mid-1980's, and I loved this movie.  As an adult, I still found the film to be very enjoyable, but it does feel dated.<br />For children and young teens these days, this movie might also feel very dated, but the theme and message of the movie still makes this film a good rental.
B0091V6TF4|4.0|i have so many of these ,collections ,by jazz greats & others , it's gr8 to have other arrangements, you don't tire of them ,but skyfall was left out
B0015T6G2G|5.0|Very informative and not an ego trip.  Honest review of his life as he sees it.  Makes you see life as he saw it.
B008HK3XU4|3.0|The only thing I would add is a elastic sleeve on the back to slide my hand into to hold it one handed while I read.  It is a bit heavy when reading a book, but otherwise I really like it.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|Movie in good condition and was viewed several times after purchase. I have purchased several movies and have been very pleased with all.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This has been a great ride. I am half way through the third book. The characters are so believable and the storyline is scary how realistic it seems. I have not seen the movie, but it could in no way do the books justice. I havent even finished book three and allready wishing there was a book four. Love these books.
B009MF56GC|5.0|Amazing ! Simple as that. The Price, The Movie, The Quality, everything is awesome. The movie was a really good movie, and this was a gift for my father who is a sucker for these kind of movies. I knew it was a great gift. The quality was amazing and I was pleased with the quick shipping (it came exactly in time for Christmas).
B009FBX5M0|4.0|i have all the bond film  sound tracks [ plus every collection or jazz ,rework by artists] i was so disapointed that the tittle track was not there &i had to wait till after xmas to hear it, it's on my wake up system so i hear it in the morning
B003DRWX9I|5.0|This CD is well worth the price.  It is fun to hear Slash play several different styles with several different vocalists (especially Fergie and Adam Levine).  It is also easy to see how Slash and Myles Kennedy decided to start a band together, their 2 songs together on this album have become concert favorites!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|When I finished this book I literally wanted to cry because it was so perfect. If you are looking for a good read, look no further.
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|Maybe I'm a sucker, but I really enjoyed this movie. They translated so many elements of the original Disney movie in such creative ways that my daughter and I couldn't stop commenting on them. From the costumes to the sets to the characters, I thought they did an excellent job of creating a more modern take on the old Snow White story.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I watche both the 1st and the 2nd in 2 days!! I loved it. GREAT SHOW! You get hooked. The DVD where what I expected and more!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|The first moments grab and hold. The year doesn't matter. We've all been there at one time or another and it finally feels good and makes sense. Pure joy including the final credits. Recommended for all ages--including snobs and bullys.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|This is one of my daughter's favorite movies. I purchased this for her as a Christmas present so she could watch it whenever she wanted to.
B007N0REX6|5.0|This record is very guitar driven (duh!) and got me interested in Alter Bridge as well as Guns N Roses again, since Slash and Myles perform several songs from Appetite for Destruction in their concerts.  It is interesting to note how much work Slash has done since Guns N Roses and how much work Axl has done since Slash left Guns.  If you like straight forward rock with two guitars and songs that do not make you think too much, this record is for you.
B006UKFFE0|4.0|Dumbs down the calculus that needs to drive a successful lean startup! Highly recommended! Only wish I had read it a year ago.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like having a calculator with me and I alway have my kindle with me. So this is a wonderful app.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|Compared to the show the ending was probably better. Still not as exciting but I still really enjoyed it and look forward to reading the next. Dexter is more insane in the book as well, hard to believe.
B000683VI4|5.0|I love this movie wanted in it a bundle but this is a great movie. Product in great condition love it!
B002T9H2LA|3.0|I am a Tarantino fan and like this movie a lot.<br />Christopher Waltz makes this movie what it is.<br /><br />As far as the format, it is a tad dated in today's market, but that is why this is so cheap, isn't it?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is great. I only want more info on ( SPOILER ALERT) how Peeta and Katniss' kids live......  Still good though!
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I loved it. It was very different than the movie with Judy garland but like it a lot better than the movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game keeps you thinking and it gets more difficult as you go along. I enjoy this game a lot
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This is a fun and silly toy.  As a zombie trying to eat more brains than your fellow zombies before being shotgunned this is a fun quick game either to play as a filler game or as a party game just for fun.  Not a lot of heavy strategy but my family enjoys it.
B000M53GM2|4.0|This movie is nice and cool. 007 best friend is missing and he has to find him. I love 007
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It really showed me that there are other people who go through the same kinds of things in high school. I found it to be very relatable. Thank you
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book! Could not put it down! Surprise ending! Wish there were more book in this series to read too!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Not only did this book make me laugh, and cry, it made me think. It has been awhile since a book caused me to examine my own views on thus world we are living in and the life I am living. It is a constant page turner and I loved the lessons and the love story along the way. Thank you John green for a book that can hopefully change some of the way so many young people live in this world today.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a wonderful app. It is fun and relaxing. I play this game several times in a day. I hope you enjoy it.
B004Y042N8|4.0|Glow Puzzle is like several other Apps with same concept but it is still Good and slightly different.<br />Instead of Sliding Finger to connect the dots, you TAP ON DOTS and Lines are Drawn for you. I actually like this method of play better than dragging lines.  It is not spectacular but Good and FUN anyway.<br />PROS:<br />1. Tap control to draw lines is accurate and all other Controls work well on Xoom Tablet.<br />2. Graphics are Pleasant with black background and Colorful Lines change color when connected.<br />3. Sound Effects are Nice enough when connections are Right or Wrong.<br />4. Decent Menu with options for Mode of Play, Timer, Level Select and Memory style of play.<br />5. NO ADS, Annoyances or Intrusions in this version.<br /><br /> CONS:<br />1. Could use some Pleasant MUSIC to add to Enjoyment and prevent Boredom.<br />2. Needs an EXIT Button to Shut Down Completely so we don't have to use App Killer to stop entirely.<br /><br />OVERALL: I like this app enough to Replace the Free version of One Touch Drawing that I have now.  This one has no Ads and Permissions seem safe and reasonable.  It is a Keeper for me.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|I have read several books on this part of history and this series provides a realistic and entertaining experiencing.  I am impressed with the detail and acting.  To get the most out of this series play it with the &#34;all roards lead to rome&#34; option.  It provides that additional detail to make you feel as if you are there.  The representation of young Octavian is very realistic, in my opion, based on other readings.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|This was very easy and convent. Not hard on the wallet either. Would recommend to family and friends. Thanks a lot
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is like Temple Run x 3 its way more fun and a little more challenging lol great app a must get
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Some of the later ones are very challenging and you really have to give them a lot of thoughts. Fun.
B009E3EY38|4.0|If you like Zeppelin then I recommend this reunion on  Bluray. Great stuff! Jason is great on drums just like his dad
145210655X|5.0|For any father that is a big fan of Star Wars a must. My hubby was very happy with this hilarious book.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys have taken well known songs and managed to make them better by reworking them in an orchestral fashion.  They have taken a few popular tunes and removed all the autotuned and electronic garbage worked into them, focusing purely on the written music itself, primarily with piano and string instruments.  To put it frankly, they made &#34;What Makes You Beautiful&#34;, into a very unique musical creation that I have told friends is the only acceptable way to listen to the song. (I HATED the original version of the song, but this version is amazing!).  This was accomplished with an unconventional method of playing the piano, I would recommend the YouTube video of how they did it. The same can be said for several other tracks.<br />They have also managed to do a very interesting version of the Star Wars soundtrack.  Good things can be said about all the tracks.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I literally could NOT put this book down. I hesitated buying because I fly through my books in a few hours and honestly didn't want to spend $4 (I know I sound cheap but when I spend close to $20 a week on books it adds up!!) DO NOT HESITATE. BUY THIS BOOK NOW! I was so floored by this book I referred many friends, you will not be disappointed. You will laugh, cry, smile and want to scream with her...the story is riveting.
B009G78EE2|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing.  My only complaint is that I already had a number of the songs featured on this album.  Still, this is one of my favorite albums of 2012 and will be on repeat for a while.  Macklemore and Ryan Lewis absolutely kill it and are primed to blow up!
B008745B32|3.0|The author's style was somewhat poetic.  This attracted me, and I liked the story, but did not find it outstanding
B005I3PAUO|4.0|Well written in an extremely terse, staccato style. Lots of twists and turns. Only a formulaic ending keeps me from awarding five stars.
B00687PWQG|5.0|It really refreshing to see a show that I can walk away from saying that was close to the way it really was.  Worth watching.
B004LUS390|5.0|This app is totaly worth paying for. I downloaded the free version and liked it, but could not save the files. With his one, you get even better options, plus you get to keep your art.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Love the options with the  different games. First time playing this and very impressed. Harder than I had anticipated, now I'm addicted
B004QX07G4|4.0|As I read this book it was if Ellen was speaking to me. I could hear her voice the entire book. Has a way of getting her messages across in a way that will make you think and keep you laughing. Very fast read.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Very historic but also had a personal touch with all the characters lives intertwining. I enjoyed it and also learned more about communism etc.<br />.
B000001F7R|5.0|This album is one of my favorite Def Leppard albums. I think a lot of Def Leppard's early sound was defined by Pete Willis' guitar playing. Pete Willis was replaced by Phil Collen during Pyromania. Pete wrote these blazing pentatonic guitar riffs that were super catchy and completely raw. If you play guitar, you might feel how limiting pentatonic scales can be, but he really knew how to create a catchy rock sound with box scales. That rawness was replaced by Phil Collen's more polished and melodic style that we recognize as Def Leppard's sound on Hysteria. Hysteria was the first album I ever bought as a kid but this album will always have a soft spot for me.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I was  never  a good  speller  but  this  makes  it  so  easy to  be  a great speller  use it  just about  everyday
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Easy reading,but good plot. Surprise ending. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys a twist at the end. Another good Grisham novel.
B007SGM084|3.0|Overrated. I actually found the storyline weak and boring. I heard a new Fifty Shades is coming out. Probably will not buy it. Heck, I could probably predict precisely what she will write.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Donald Fagen could never do any wrong,as so with Sunken Condos. Someone needs to explain to me how can you listen to a CD like this and it sounds better everytime you hear it? Donald Fagen has great taste in music, and he does'nt mind sharing it with you. Slinky thing, is a bonafide steppers grove, and all the other tunes are just as great.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Always a pleasure to re-read an old classic.  Enjoyed it very much at the Christmas Season.  Only saw one typographical error.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|i'm hooked and watched season 1 & 2 in one weekend. one of the best dramatic series i've watched.  it's a must see!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is very difficult to figure out what will happen  in each chapter.<br />A murder mystery in the making of a small town.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Glad i got to finally read this classic. It was worth the wait. Pieces of eight. Pieces of eight. Wonderful.
0345803507|5.0|I love this series, probably my favorite is Book 2, 50 Shades Darker.  But book three has it great points,and lots of twists and turns.  I really can't wait to see if they make a movie out of these books.  I nominate Matt Bomer or Gabrial Macht for the role of Christian Grey.  It would be fun to see them become Christian.<br /><br />Carolyn G.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I have had this for only one week. So far on one charge it has partially recharged my ipad mini 4 times and my iphone twice. These were not complete recharges because I seldom wait for a device to be depleted, but so far its delivering the juice to keep things humming. Obviously cannot speak as to the long haul capabilities of this item because of having such a short time. I'll update if any changes occur.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this app is probably the best ive played!!! it is fun and you can even get your friends to play with you!!!
B00846REIS|5.0|It was very interesting from the beginning. Couldn't put it down.<br />Appeals to young new lovers as well as older experienced adults.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|This book started off okay, but just kept getting worse as I read. I only got about half way before I quit reading.<br /><br />It just did not keep my interest. The story just wasn't believable to me.
0345803485|5.0|Loved this book, did not know what to expect.  Saw an interview with El James on TV. and that moved me to read the book.<br /><br />It does not disappoint.  I haven't been moved by a book since Memoirs of an Invisible Man.  many moons ago.<br /><br />Great trilogy!!!  I read it in 7 nights.<br /><br />Carolyn G.
B003TSEL7S|2.0|I got his book for my 11 yr old son. After maybe the 5th Chapter he lost interest in the book. Which says a lot. If the characters are good he'll read a book til the end and reread it over again. He wasn't very pleased.
B009VB9VKY|4.0|it was an ok movie, but come on, who's renting it for the plot, hehehe. very hot men and very hot dancing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Interesting read, very sexy but also a love story.<br />I hated for it to end and not have another book to read with the same story line.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift and the recipient has watched it several times and is very happy. For anyone who likes this movie it makes a great gift.
B008RJFRTK|5.0|This product gives you offline GPS data about you location and is easy to use.  Good APP for those who like to travel to remote locations.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Easily one of the most believable zombie stories of our time. Max makes it seem like there is a reasonable explanations and a very plausible way for the dead to come back to life. The angle of the story keep you engaged through out and you can actually picture yourself as the person sharing the experiences if the story tellers as if if was you doing the interviews. Greatly entertaining.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|it was better then i thought it would be... lol. it was pretty cool. worth renting if your into vampire movies
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Enjoyed this second book in a series of 3. Needed to continue the good read.<br />Always  liked the story like and can't wait for the movie.
B003WMX3SY|4.0|I like this case. you can do so much with it as far as setup goes. I gave it four stars because Antec Lanboy could have some improvements: ( 1) the HD pulls down to the back due to the weight of the power cord. I would put rods and clip springs and not rubber cord to hold the HD. ( 2) I knew dust would come in with the fans pulling air in. You have to change some of the fans around. Antec did not study this part of the design completely. The problems are ease to fixs, an I would buy this case again . NICE CASE ! it as so much to offer.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|Poorly written, improbable, impossibly strong Abe Lincoln that can jump on top of galloping horses while gets assassinated. Don't bother.
B001ZG4J00|5.0|What a great poet/musician. I lived in Mexico in the 70s, I guess that's why I missed him.<br />I listen to him a lot.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I liked it, but I liked all the batman movies. I thought it was very entertaining. def. worth renting. :-)
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It is a follow- up  of Bared to You. A continuing love story with lots of twists and turns.<br />Very interesting read.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|What's not to love about this game?  A great way to kill time.  There are ads, but they are across the very bottom of the screen, abd are very unobtrusive.  Give this FREE game a try, and you will be hooked!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Ok, so the best movies, in my opinion, leave you wanting more. A really good movie leaves you asking more about the characters and the world long after you have finished watching it. Such is the case of this film Looper. I loved it, and I wanted to know more about it. I wanted to know why they used the weapons they used, and how they dressed because it all came together so well in the final product. There are futuristic looking cars but there are also current era cars that seem to be retro-fitted with solar panels or tubes and hoses that come out of the exhaust and appear to limit emissions. All this comes together to make a futuristic society that feels real and believable. The world that is created is fresh and original, and yet very real and contemporary.<br />Joseph Gordon is an amazing actor and truly transforms himself into a younger Bruce Willis. Bruce does a fine job of being his usual badass self, and Emily Blunt is believable and not the typical damsel in distress.<br />The only off putting thing was the makeup on JGL, but after 5 minutes i forgot he was wearing makeup to look like Bruce Willis, and actually believed he looked like that.<br />This was a really good movie and stood out among the sequels and reboots that have flooded Hollywood.
B0092ZEIN4|3.0|I order this controller for my Nexus 7 got it up and sync with my tablet. Software needs to be updated so  you can map swipe with the stick or digital pad, still waiting for Nyko to update the software!
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|It was good, but I liked the story line from the original better. acting was good too. I think it was worth the rental
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|A lot of potential but feels like its missing something, still a good action movie and you got to love the judges gun
B007N19DMA|5.0|This book is an excellent reference for an undergrad or graduate interested in skeletal anatomy.  The great thing about this book is it is relatively small and can easily be carried back and forth. I have the larger White book with the large photos and this smaller manual.  Both are very useful references that helped me learn my skeletal anatomy and become proficient in it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Challenging. Fun easy to use app. Very entertaining  I recommend this app to anyone who wants to play a strategic gam
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! I love how it had a plot and it kept you interested in the book. I could not put the book down. I can not wait until May when the third book comes out. My only issue is now is trying to find a book equally as good as this one was! :)
B009NQKXYK|3.0|I watched this movie in HD and thought it looked great but was disapointed I couldn't rent in 3D. The movie was ok. Predictable, but entertaining.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Really enjoyed how the characters intermingled. Love the history intertwined with the fictional characters. I wish textbooks could be more like this. Kids would never say they hate history again. My Dad and I love Ken Follett so this is another one I will be forwarding to him!
B008476HBM|5.0|This is a classic novel everyone should read.  Jane Austin is witty and creative, this book is not just for a high school English class.
B000TO0TCQ|5.0|I have read all of the books so far and I love this one the most. It has such a great plot. I am an 10 year old and I love the these books to the moon and back.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Whke it's good to set a background, that's all this story had done. Hard to continue reading. Don't know if it will get better if I continue . This was rated #1??
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I heard about this series only recently and with the winter months upon us, I found some time to watch this and give it a try.  Phenomenal!  I just wanted to take a weekend and watch all of them at once.  The costumes, scenery, story line...it's all great.  Love unexpected surprises and this was certainly one.
B0067R0APK|5.0|Ok...  I don't understand why the masses are complaining about this app...  ALL DEVICES ARE DIFFERENT...  I have it installed on an old dell streak 7 and galaxy s 4g and they both run this application flawlessly... All features work...  But i will say it works a little better on my tablet then on my phone...  I think any bugs you may come across with this will be few and minor...  I have modified both my devices with different cooked android operating systems and minimal difficulties have occurred...  Ignore the haters...  It's a good app...
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Oh the many surprising deaths throughout the book! They put me on edge anytime anyone is in a potentially life-threatening situation -- which is quite often! I am loving this series and can't wait for the next book, and the one after that. Martin has done so much obvious research and put together such a deep, rich, epic world that you won't help but get swept up in the lives of these characters. Another thing that impresses me is thinking about what sort of system Martin must have in place to keep track of everything. You never feel cheated out of a character's development and you never forget what was going on between intervening chapters and you just thirst for more. Anyhow, if you can't tell, I recommend this book if you've read the others.
B00005V9IL|4.0|...with aspect ratio. My TV was not able to adjust to full screen. Image stayed small at full zoom. Blue ray player has no control. Never seen this befor.<br /><br />Good flick of course.
B009FAQ9JW|4.0|As others have mentioned, this looks horrible. Imagine a VHS tape quality. Now, add in horizontal black lines every time the camera, or an actor, moves quickly (most of the time). I didn't think it possible for something to be released looking this bad.<br />The story is a good one and deserves better treatment than this. I actually rented the movie on streaming video, since the hard copies were so terrible, hoping the streaming one would be better. In a word: NO.<br /><br />+edit: This movie is so captivating that I actually didn't noticed how bad the video was after awhile. It is not your typical western and well worth a watch. The cinematography is beautiful and the story is classically good. The idea of the \\"one eyed jack\\" is that of the duality of humankind. The face you show and the one that is hidden. This movie is not one of the cliche westerns; you are sometimes not sure just who the bad guy is.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Absolutely amazing!  A book about love, living, and dying, not really a &#34;cancer book&#34;.  A tear- jerker and a sweet novel with a little bit of sass.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|Megalithic Symphony - 4/5<br />A simple and off-ball song, fitting intro.<br /><br />Some Sort of Creature - 3/5<br />No matter what you say, this album would be lacking without this song, even if it doesn't completely make sense.<br /><br />Soul Wars - 5/5<br />Very catchy and addictive to listen to. Amazing.<br /><br />People - 4/5<br />Same with this song as the previous, except a little bit less catchy, as the repetitive vocals towards the end are a tiny bit annoying.<br /><br />Jump on my Shoulders - 5/5<br />Very catchy with a great upbeat tempo. Fantastic chorus.<br /><br />Burn it Down - 4/5<br />Great tempo, great song.<br /><br />Guilty Filthy Soul - 4/5<br />I love the message given by this song, with one of my favorite things of this song being the chorus.<br /><br />Kill Your Heroes - 5/5<br />It was without surprise that this song would become one of their more popular ones. The upbeat tune with the meaning of the lyrics gives a good feeling.<br /><br />My Nightmare's Dream - 3/5<br />Kind of an eerie feeling to it when considering the title and really thinking about it and the \\"All I Need\\" choir-y lyrics in it.<br /><br />Sail - 5/5<br />My hero, or better said, reason I discovered the song. Amazing bass in this song, and addictive piano tunes. Lyrics really speak to me.<br /><br />Wake Up - 5/5<br />This is probably my favorite song on the album overall. Minus the intro, the entire song as a great rhythm and extremely catchy lyrics.<br /><br />Not Your Fault - 5/5<br />Another one of those popular songs that really have a great rhythm and catchy lyrics that really speak to you.<br /><br />All I Need - 5/5<br />A wonderful change up to the upbeat tempo songs with its slowed down tempo. Lyrics really give a warm feeling.<br /><br />Knights of Shame - 4/5<br />This song probably is one of the biggest oddballs. While I don't like the rapping in the middle all that much (about 3:53 to 6:00), I do however enjoy the rest of the song, which makes up for it, as well as the end of the song (AFTER the 2 minutes of silence).<br /><br />Overall - 10/5<br />This is one of my favorite albums of all time to listen to and the idea of AWOL making a new album in the future is an exciting thought.as well as the end of the song (AFTER the 2 minutes of silence).<br /><br />Overall - 10/5<br />This is one of my favorite albums of all time to listen to and the idea of AWOL making a new album in the future is an exciting thought.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I Loved it! The story kept you guessing the whole time.  I would definitely recommend this book if you want a rollercoaster ride.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Poignant and sweet. A year in the life of a freshman boy who wants to fit in. I loved this story.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|This was a fantastic movie, Matthew and Channing ... O M G yummy . the story line was great , It was nioce to see guys up on stage ...
1439153663|5.0|I loved the book.. especially the spirit of the characters. How they would keep each other moving forward no matter what happened. Kathleen Grissom is a great story teller.
B002G1K82Q|3.0|One of my fav movies of all time! made the best christmas gift to my wife! she was so happy thank you so much
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|I have a Kindle Fire. After 40+ minutes to download, it would never install. It said I didn't have enough memory/room, so I removed a bunch of apps and it still wouldn't install. Thank goodness it was free, or I would have asked for a refund.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The story didn't wow me or anything, but I don't regret buying it. It was exciting in the beginning but I figured out the twist before it happened so I was a little disappointed. The story was believable and the author is a good writer.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|This movie was good but I did lose interest . I guess I was spoiled with Matt ... This product was brand new and was shipped out super fast .
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Outstanding!  He tells it like it is. Should be compulsory reading for anyone thinking of going in to any branch of the military.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The filming, acting, and story lines are amazing! My husband and I have watched season 1, 2, and the 1st 3 episodes of season 3 since Christmas!
B000CCIVDO|2.0|I am returning these because they don't cover my ears. They gap quite a bit at the bottom. They do the same to my husband. He did some review before buying these and was surprised as the poor quality. I could use them but I figured for the price, I should have something that works right.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|It was nothing too special. I found it to be fairly predictable.  Worth reading, but don't think your getting a page turner.
B005LAII12|5.0|This is a must see movie ... OMG Ted (seth) is amazing . I wish I had a teddybear like this growing up .<br />Brand new dvd, very fast shipper (once it was on the release date) . Will do business again
B0059XTUVI|5.0|it was a bit hard to get into this movie...then I realized, it takes her<br />story from present day in her dementia.  Such a terrible disease and<br />she was a strong lady. Dementia is no respecter of persons!  Well<br />done! Meryl Streep does it again!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The filming, acting, and story lines are brilliant!! My husband and I have watched season 1, 2, and the 1st 3 episodes of season 3 since Christmas!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Felt it was a page turner and loved the twisted ending that I never saw coming.  Makes me want to go back and read it again.
B008X6N1OA|5.0|Always been a John Leguizamo fan and the characters in this movie are just so funny and we love them all!
B009LGO88E|5.0|I decided to import the CPP from Japan to go with my US 3DS XL and I'm glad I did. It works perfectly with the domestic 3DS XL and really makes playing MGS3 so much better. The CPP is surprisingly light, and while it does add a lot of bulk to the already large XL it feels great in hand. I wish more games supported this accessory.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Loved this movie!  Enjoyable characters in a moving story.  It is an entertaining tour of India, actually makes me want to go there now.
B000PHNHMQ|5.0|tried the MASTERCRAFT MAXIMUM,HITACHI,HAUSMANN EXPERT,DEWALT......and nothing comes even CLOSE to comparing!<br />it`s tough,light,powerful,easy to use,easy to load,hasn`t jammed since purchased.<br />highly recommended for home and out in the field.

B000HIVIOW|4.0|'The Snowman' has been required viewing in my house every Christmas since it was first broadcast in 1982.  I wanted to introduce my American family to this quintessentially English story with its special magic.  There is now a lovely photo of my 40+ nephew and his 18 month old daughter both equally entranced as they watched the DVD.  Hopefully, a new Christmas tradition has been born.<br />For those who don't know it, it's a magical tale of a young boy and the night when his snowman came to life.  The film is virtually silent.  There are a few introductory words from the author and Aled Jones singing 'Walking In the Air'.  As my elder niece said ' Oh, that's where that's from.'<br />One of the joys of the film is that it is drawn in the same style as the book.<br />Enjoy!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|After hearing so much about this series, I rented season one and couldn't wait to keep going. It's even better streaming HD. I've never liked soap operas and DA has occasional sniffs of the genre, but the story and characters are so appealing these minor notes are easily ignored. The BBC has created yet another hit series and this American can't get enough of it.
B0091REZMW|2.0|Great graphics, but I've been in the same 2 rooms forever, looking for the same items repeatedly. I don't want to buy diamonds and it looks like you must to advance with any speed.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Augustus a boy who needed a something after his something had been turned into nothing . Hazel a girl who didn't give a rat's ass. When they met Augustus fell. Hazel fell .

0985081821|5.0|This was a marvelous read. I quickly came absorbed into the plot and quickly identified with the characters especially Sophia. In college I studied Religious Studies and History, and thus, connected with Sophia right away. Rebecca does a thorough job in disspelling the myths associated with the Wiccan religion and through Sophia shows that Wiccans are everyday people like you and me and not 'witches\\" wearing all black carrying around their broomsticks.<br /><br />Even though the book is intended for Young Adults anybody of any age would enjoy this book. The characters are complex yet very easy to relate to and the plot is suspensful and will keep you full of anticipation. Despite the book's many themes such as Religion, finding one's self (such as Sophia), and contemporary social issues this book is easy to read and you will not want to put it down. I cannot wait for the second book in this series.
B004Y042N8|4.0|I had the free one and so glad I can get the paid one now! I've loved playing this game! It's great for late night relaxing  gaming before bed! I don't mind that there is no music as I always have the volume off. I am a sucker for a puzzle game and this one starts out easy but gets pretty hard as you go. I just wish it had a undo button so I wouldn't have to start over for one miss placement. Once they put that I'll give it 5 stars!
B008YZXYY2|5.0|HUSBAND LOVED THIS CHRISTMAS PRESENT. IT WAS A TOTAL SUPRISE. WILL HAVE TO PICK UP PART 2 FOR HIM SOON.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I couldn't imagine myself watching a show about zombies, let alone not being able to stop myself from watching straight through every episode.  Couldn't stop - awesome show.  Great characters... completely unpredictable... very well written.
032147404X|5.0|I have looked at this book and it has a lot of very useful info in this book. It has answered question to a few things i was wondering about with my camera!
B006LSZECO|5.0|very intriguing. intellectually written drama. couldn't  't put it down. great character development development  this novel. worth reading but stay . on your toes.
B0083Z614S|5.0|It has magic , mystery , love , hate , and stubbornness all entwined with each other I think it is a great book for all ages to read over and over and over again
1449433251|5.0|This is a great books no issues with it.  Love all the Calvin and Hobbit is these four books.  I've enjoyed reading these very much and would recommend these to anyone.
B009K0P10K|5.0|If you are addicted to this show, you can't stop watching during Season 2.  I just started watching based on a recommendation of a friend and watched both seasons 1 and 2 during the holidays.  Loved them both.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Can't stop laughing and pointing out funniest bits to my friends.  I could relate so much of  it to situations I had in my life, and my responses, but she said it better.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am just loving it! I saw the movie first, but the book is so much better than the book!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the 101 games + 31 is a great game wit many challenges some r hard and some are hard but they all are fun.....
B0049VZ222|5.0|Yes, it does have zombies, and I can't believe how great this show is and how much I love it.  I kept hearing my cousins talk about it, so I decided to try a couple of episodes to see what all the hype was.  I didn't stop watching until I finished every episode that has been made thus far and am waiting impatiently for it to start again.  It is very well written, and never predictable. It isn't about the zombies, it is about so much more.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Never heard of this series of books, but saw the steller ratings and figured I would give it a try.<br />It was ok, but did not impress.  reading Charm School now and it is head and shoulders above this Connelly book.<br />I have not read Connelly's other books, but if this one is an indication, this story was not a real exciting thriller or big time sleuth.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Downloaded the book, but now have the monumental task of reading the huge volume.  I have always wanted to read it, now I finally will get the chance.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|Excellent! if you liked alexander skarsgaurd from true blood then you will enjoy generation kill check out the special features as well
9500426404|5.0|A gift for my kid.<br />the condition of the book was excellent.<br />El Principito was my favorite story and now can be of my son.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|The book was interesting...but like book 4 the story ends abruptly. It is starting to be a joke...if I have to wait 5 years for another half baked story I am going to put the series out if mind until it is completed. Hopefully Martin doesn't drop dead before he decides to finish...like Jordan.  Don't get me wrong I love both authors...they just set the bar high so they are judged harshly.
B005Z271Y6|2.0|I Love Adele's music and was very much looking forward to this concert dvd. After two songs I left the headphones on and left the room. The music is live Adele, which is exquisite. But the video direction is nauseating.  The director has many beautiful and grand camera angles at his disposal. Unfortunately, he feels he has to use every one on every song.  There is absolutely no \\"soul\\" or feeling to the editing of the visuals, it's just a never ending series of cut after cut after cut completely destroying the mood of every song. It reminds me of watching a 1960s variety show with 2 minutes to cram every angle you've got into the time limit, but it never stops.  I'll definitely continue to listen to the cd, but seriously doubt I'll ever watch the blu ray again.  A bummer indeed.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|Great movie, cool soundtrack.  Nice to enjoy something a little different. Hawaiian slack key guitar brings the island lifestyle home.
B0063IH60K|5.0|solitary is a pretty awesome card game, I play it every time I'm bored and can easily be entertained again.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I loved this book, his comitment, and how his journey first started, This journey could not be just anyone, he was very focused to set his goals and put them in front of a lot of things that many people could not give up.. Study and training was well deserved in the end. For me this book was fantastic i loved it and have told my friends about it.
034580404X|5.0|Love the characters.  The author describes them and their lives perfectly so that you can invision who they are and what they are about.  The books want you to see more into Christians life and what makes him the way he is.  There are quite a few schockers in the story.  This is like an introduction to the life of bdsm but not as out there that it will scare readers away.  It's definitely a great story and happy ending.  The only thing i didn't like was how the writer made Anna as persistent or disobedient as she was it made we want to slap her at times LOL but overall the sex scenes were great and intriguing :)
B0026772N8|5.0|I first purchased this book when it was first published and still considered just a work of fiction.  It has since moved to being compulsory reading material on many University courses.  Regardless of the status the book continues to help with my imagination for the future changes and social development.  It can also be just an interesting read but given a opening to a new way of looking at the world this can also offer great change.  Yes, I still have one of the copies of the book (somewhere) but now I have this (to me important book) on my Kindle and always available for reference.
0307592731|5.0|It's beautifully written and it speaks to me.  As someone who took my own leave of my life to go and find myself again, I found this book relatable.  I bought a second copy to send to my mentor.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read...it sad,funny and makes you think about what you have. And what other people go through. I can't say enough about this book. So I will just say thank you .
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|(: it was an amazing read. You need to read it. Now. Likw seriously. Go. Read it. Read it now.
B004HO6HWA|1.0|I had no idea that the sexual content was so-o-o-o-o-o explicit.  I HATED the movie and I wish I NEVER bought it.  .
630542845X|5.0|I have always loved this movie and I'm so happy to have it on DVD so I can watch it any time I like.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I found The Hunger Games to be a very riveting story. One I think could be enjoyed by a broad range of readers. The story kept me on the edge of my seat and I found it extremely difficult to put down. I cannot wait to start book two.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It's a good game but I don't like how you have to download more content just to get further in the game.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Loved it... interesting how she's in love with her bro n he's in love with her.. super crazy... but Simon being a vamp was like wtf
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I read this book in class this year, and everyone else hated it. But I've always been weird, not the typical teenager, and I loved it. It's got great vocabulary, deep thoughts, and its really well written, and considering its age, it's what I'd call a classic. Worth the read. ^^
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My 3 year old boy loves trains cars and planes and he also loves puzzles so he loves playing with this app.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|You should know the continued series is never as good as the first book. It's a must read, just to follow through with what you started.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I did like it! Couldn´t stop reading it. My brother told me girls and women in general loved it in the US and Canada. So.. he purchased it for me as a present during his trip to Argentina. I´d love to go on with the trilogy.
0316224588|5.0|I became a large fan of Ian Rankin when I read one of his previous novels. He just has a way of keeping the suspense just dangling in front of you so that you turn the pages faster and faster. Standing in Another Man's Grave was no different.<br /><br />Detective John Rebus is back and is even though he's now retired but will not stop until he gets what he wants, as always. Rebus is a civilian working for SCRU (Special Crime Review Unit) and a phone call gets Rebus down stairs talking to Nina Hazlitt. Nina's daughter Sally went missing on the A9 in 1999. Rebus will soon find that there have been many women that have gone missing on the A9. Rebus can't go at it alone, he will need help from his old colleague Siobhan Clarke. Siobhan is back and she is now a Detective and Rebus and her will soon find themselves traveling that stretch of the A9.<br /><br />Is there a link between these cases? Can Rebus find out what is going on before anyone else goes missing and his superiors keep him from finding the truth? John Rebus' quick wit and determination will have you wanting more with each page you turn. I love mysteries that keeps you guessing and are not easily figured out.<br /><br />If you enjoy the thrill of the chase, then Standing in Another Man's Grave is one novel that you do not want to miss. Rankin is a master of suspense and will take you on an amazing journey of wits.  With gripping twists and turns, you will not figure this out until the very end!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|It kept me hooked 'I couldn't put it down.A very good read. He has always been a good auther and after years of not being able to read,I'm disappointed in his writing.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|This is the one Diamond Edition i realized I had missed in the collection. I just started collecing all the Disney Classics to hand down to my kids one day as did my father but they were on VHS lol. But this is one in the Disney vault and the seller had it available for a decent price and was new in the wrap and everything, fast shipping and well packed. Product arrived at my house in excellent condition. Thanks again and thanks for the great service and product.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Clever concept, and the ingenious story line/background the author creates is probably one of the best I've read in years. Characters are well thought out and described so well you understand every feeling and action that transpires. Book is definitely better than the movie.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoy this game, it's free and gives me something to do while I'm sitting in a waiting room or just have a few minutes to kill. I do wish they gave you more coins to play with or would replenish them sooner but overall a fun game.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|One of the best mystery/horror classics of all time! Bram Stoker is a master of the genres. This is the one book that inspired a host of vampire stories and mythology that we know and love. Anyone reading this for the first time is in for a real treat. Can't recommend it enough!
B000V63CGM|4.0|Caught the title song on the radio recently and knew I had to get the album for my MP3 player. I had the album once upon a time, in vinyl, and never got a CD. Very glad that I've got this collection back in my musical lineup.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Even though Mary is a little spoiled girl, little did I know she was going to change. I feel really happy for Colin and I agree that it was magic. I recommend this book to others! ^_^
B003O86FMW|3.0|never gets enough attention or has greatness within.. and neither does this book. It's a must read to follow up, but don't expect the same creative writing skills Collins showed in the first book.
B004Y042N8|1.0|The game just gives you a graph, and you need to find a Hamiltonian path.  It's really boring, and the interface just isn't great.  Avoid this game.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I'm a 57 yo female and a new fan of Adele. I bought 19 & 21 & watched the Live concert. Incredible. I agree with the other 5 star reviewers - 19 is great but 21 is fabulous. The songs on 21 really speak to me & the quality of the recording is outstanding. The songs flow one into the other - well co-ordinated.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|ready to go from the start. I found the alarms easy to set, easy too change and on the Kindle HD Fire with Dolby sound the sleep timer function helps me get to sleep when I am in a hotel on the road for my work. Well done!!
B000NQBIM0|5.0|I love this movie. I am collecting the whole collection but this one is the best. Stiffler is my favorite and keeps me laughing at his craziness all throughout the movie.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|If you like time travel, this is the book. Even though it's a long read with many pages, there just aren't enough. Great story with lots of action, lots of intrigue, and a powerful love story. Don't let the initial subject fool you. It's the journey of getting there that makes this book an incredible read. HIghly recommended.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|I love Viva La Vida. It is 2013 and I still play the songs. ColdPlay is great, listen to them still today.
B000MZHW4A|5.0|This movie was great.It shows some of the truth on this topic.Most of us don't think about what it takes to get that ring on your finger.<br />Leo is a great actor in everything he does.Lots of action,sounds,sights.We enjoyed it...a lot!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I simply could not put this book down, the suspense, the love story and the reality of abuse that some of us live with on a daily basis.
0765325950|4.0|It was one week after having suffered a series of strokes when I learned of Robert Jordan's death from a small TV hanging over my hospital bed. Of course I had heard of him and his Wheel of Time series many times before, but I had never read any of his work. Something about the timing of his death and my own recent experiences made me want to get to know this man better. I felt sorrow for all of his fans, how his story would never be completed.<br /><br />A couple months later I heard refreshing news; the news that another writer would pick up the mantle and write Jordan's last volume. I remember thinking to myself how generous of Robert to allow someone else to finish his tale - how selfless an act to prepare for another artist to add the final touches. I was blown away and I rushed to catch up in time for the final battle.<br /><br />I found myself falling into RJ's universe as I listened to The Eye of the World. I became engrossed in the struggles between the shadow and light so much that I searched for ways to spend time alone so I could \\"read\\" more.  I listened to the novels as I ran miles around my town preparing for my first marathon. I listened to them as I tore my house down to the studs and rebuilt it for my wife and new baby daughter. I listened to them as I flew back and forth across the country for work. A lot of good memories float to the surface every time I think of this series and I give partial credit to them for my recovery.<br /><br />To take a word from Thom Merrilin, the last battle was \\"exquisite\\". A Memory of Light delivered on all of its promises. It is packed with action. It tied up all the many loose ends. It brought about an ending. Robert Jordan can now rest as his tale has been told. His memory has become legend.<br /><br />A Memory of Light has so many plots! On the surface it might seem a daunting task to read and keep track of them all, but Brandon Sanderson groups them together so you're not following too much at once. The world is in utter chaos and all the main characters have crucial roles to play. No one of them has a task more important than another, save maybe Rand himself. As Rand prepares for the final battle, he uses all the assets at his disposal. After setting them in play he leaves them to their own successes and failures as he finally sets out to confront the dark one.<br /><br />You begin to wonder as the shadow pushes back, how can the light prevail? The world is being torn apart by the dark one as he attempts to break the great wheel. Cracks that fall away into the void of nothingness, bubbles of evil erupting across the lands, and forsaken permanently burning souls from the pattern with balefire all plague the armies of the light. Slowly the pieces slide together as all the many loose ends from the previous thirteen books are gathered together into one final weave. Heroes fight, friends are lost and forsaken are left behind as the third age comes to a close.<br /><br />Brandon's writing mimics Robert Jordan's very well, though he writes with a youthful flourish that adds new life into an aging story. I hadn't known of Brandon prior to this venture of wearing the dragon pin so proudly. Since then I have read almost all of his work and wholeheartedly recommend him. A Memory of Light does not fall short of his standard.<br /><br />Throughout the three final volumes, the characters have all remained true to Robert Jordan's telling. Our farm-boy heroes have all grown up over the course of their adventures, yet they remain themselves. Matrim Cauthon is still the same gambler he has always been, though he is much more calculating now. Perrin remains the most level headed of the three ta'veren and Rand's insanity has given way to a clear head that is needed for the final battle.<br /><br />If you don't already know, the magic system within the Wheel of Time series is one of the best known in the fantasy genre. It is defined almost scientifically with advantages and dangers to its useand with opposite forces for every action. Not only is it soundly structured, it is also artful in its casting and the descriptions of its outcomes are both beautiful and ferocious. Aside from the primary magic system within the world, the pattern of existence itself grants new mystical abilities to heroes and villains to add balance and uncertainty to the stories.<br /><br />The world within the Wheel of Time is one of opposites. Villains are almost always evil and heroes are good. There are some minor exceptions, but this is not your gritty fantasy filled with anti-heroes. At its heart, this is your \\"farm-boy grows up and saves the world\\" fantasy story.<br /><br />I don't know how \\"original\\" A Memory of Light was. I certainly haven't read many books with such a wide scope, but most of the elements within the story were previously seen. There were a few new bits and pieces, but this story was more about concluding the legacy than about surprising us with new notions.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed A Memory of Light. It was a fitting end to one of the greatest epic fantasy series to date. I'd probably have liked it even more if it hadn't been so long, but the length served the purpose of wrapping up loose ends. It truly was unavoidable - there were so many. I also felt the ending would have been more powerful if a few more heroes hadn't survived into the fourth age. That isn't to say I didn't tear up at their survivals. How could I not? The Wheel of Time has come to an ending.<br /><br />I \\"read\\" this entire series via audiobook, the final volume being no exception. Kate Reading and Michael Kramer have practically become two of my best friends now, though I've never met or even talked with either of them.<br /><br />I'm torn between four and five stars. I think the telling by Brandon definitely deserves the full five rating, but the \\"farm-boy saves the world\\" story has been done quite a bit. This is a really good story though and one that has earned its place in history.<br /><br />Thank you Robert Jordan for this epic series and for having the humility to allow another to finish your tale. Thank you Brandon Sanderson for completing this work with the grace only few have. Thank you Harriet for having the will to see your husband's work completed - you made an excellent choice.and with opposite forces for every action.

B00A9X9ORI|3.0|Kind of a neat concept, but even suspending disbelief that time-travel might exist the story-concept is still full of techni-holes.  I'll watch it again when it hits the 'Prime' list.  Check with me then for a (possibly) better review.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|a great book, enjoyed reading it as my first purchase for my new kindle fire. i would recommend it .
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|This author disgusts me! I did not want to read about high school kids having sex. And I definitely did not want to read scenes where a child is being molested.  If I would've known the main characters were still in high school I would've never bought this book.  This book could've been great if the characters were not so young & the details of child sexual abuse encounters were left out. I will never buy anything else written by this author. She disgusts me!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|As a lover of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's &#34;Sherlock Holmes&#34; I was wary about a modern day version of his works. I gave it a try anyway and I'm so glad I did! Intelligent, funny, action packed and fine acting make this series well worth watching. I only wish they made more than three episodes per year!
B0091QS88K|3.0|My 4yo likes this app, but it only holds her attention for about 5 minutes and then she's on to the next thing.  I think the repetition  is something that she doesn't like.  I watch her play it one day and it seems to be the same characters over and over again.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good book but dragged on a bit in the middle. I did enjoy the<br />Ending and wish there were more books in this series.
0765325950|5.0|I finished A Memory of Light a little over half an hour ago. I am still awash in all of the emotions the story has caused to well up in me.<br /><br />I grew up with these characters. I've known them for longer than most of my friends, and some of my family. This book is a fitting and *exquisite* culmination of those relationships. I wept for those we lost, and I thrilled with pride to see my friends fulfill their promise. This book is the end to a journey I have been on for most of my life, and it is a good and fitting end.<br /><br />This book is a 900 page avalanche. It is a story of pitched battle, from beginning to end, and the pace is suited to that story. One feels almost frantic to keep up. Despite this, the story never gets out of hand. You can tell Sanderson is in control, the loose ends are drawn together nicely. It is not without flaw, but it is very damn good.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson: If you ever read this, thank you.
0756688701|5.0|My son loves Cars and was so excited to receive this book. It came with a Lightening McQueen that we did not own, and it shipped almost immediately.
B0044KI79S|5.0|I absolutely love this show.  Shows like this often tend to lose my interest after this many seasons, but wow it really keeps getting better!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|5 stars because I could think of nothing else until I finished this book- all day at work I just wanted to know what was going to happen! Beautifully written, I felt everything the characters were feeling. Loved it
B005IQZB14|5.0|Inspirational and heartbreaking and honest to the core.  This girls got a real life in a real world and deals with life the best way she knows.  She has alot of fortitude and guts.  She is a heroine to all women who have experienced &#34;life&#34;.
B008AT9XOC|4.0|This was a gift for a family member, and it went over really well. This has always been a terrific movie, and the addition of the legendary original ending is just the topper.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I loved the books and the series.  I am an avid reader and these books kept me interested form the beginning the the last page of the last book even tho I had seen it on the Television, I cant wait for the next installment<br /><br />H
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book is hilarious and I can't wait for more. Even these books have pictures they encouraged me to read more because it gave me hope that there isn't any boring books out there.

0316017930|5.0|I've gifted this book so many times over the past several months.  It's a quick read, detailed, yet not overwhelming.  Kept telling people, &#34;Wait to you read the part about ____.&#34;
B002SAUCBC|5.0|I won't provide a summary of the story, since many others have already provided it.  This story was very well written, and I was able to picture each of the main boys based on the vivid descriptions.  The end certainly was predictible, but there were many twists along the way.  I don't want to analyze the book, because I believe that is personal opinion.  However the main character in the story embraced so many characteristics and qualities that are symbolic of a heroic personality.<br />I do think the ending was a bit of a letdown,but it was left open enough for interpretation.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|simply amazing; i would be lost without note. How else could I keep track of so many things to do?
B0086700CM|3.0|The game hiccups slightly every few seconds. If it happens while trying to jump or turn, the touch isnt recignized, and you just smash into the wall. Very frustrating. Should not be lagging on a samsung galaxy s3.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Enjoyed all 3 books!!!  love it, love it, love it!  Good story line and wow what can I say more.........
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Intellectually heart breaking and uplifting all at once... I was surprised how it ended, it took me a minute to absorb, but there is truth to every word
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I've seen Clint Eastwood movies when he was young, but there is some grace about him now that he's older and wise, he's still &#34;macho&#34; but also vulnerable. The appeal of him is so much better now.  What can I say, Amy Adams is always her delightful self and Justin Timberlake is always adorably flirty that you wish you were the chick in the film.<br /><br />Maybe it's more a chick flick, but I liked it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Well done. Enough said without over doing.  Keep me interested from beginning to end.  Couldn't wait to read the next.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was not convinced that I would like this series that is based on the comic book series, but because many of my friends were raving about it so I decided to give it a try.  I immediately knew after just one episode that this was a very captivating and compelling series.  The story lines were fascinating and gripping and that was the biggest surprise.  A very well written scripted show and I would highly recommended it even if zombies is not your cup of tea.
B00A6RVRXG|5.0|Prior to its release, many online publications touted the new album as the band's most personal and sincere since And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out.  Pared down to a mere ten songs (with not a single track passing the seven minute mark), Fade sees Yo La Tengo taking a more concise route with their songwriting.  Here's my track by track take on how it turned out...<br /><br />Ohm - From the moment the infectious opening drumbeat of \\"Ohm\\" kicks into full gear, leading into a wall of shakers, I found myself sucked in immediately.  The matter-of-fact lyrics would be somewhat depressing if they weren't sung in such an upbeat manner but like life itself, we all learn to take the bitter with the sweet. (9/10)<br /><br />Is That Enough - The West Side Story-esque marriage of grunge and baroque pop makes for some catchy bubblegum pop.  The crunchy guitars and slightly country-tinged vocals sound especially good when laid against a smooth blanket of orchestral strings.  Hooks aplenty.  (10/10)<br /><br />Well You Better - The 60's Motown vibe conjured in this song practically begs for a jukebox renaissance.  If this song doesn't get your toe tapping, you seriously have a problem.  (10/10)<br /><br />Paddle Forward - A throwback to the earlier days of YLT, this one is a pretty straightforward grunge track but with the vocal harmonies only Ira and Georgia can pull off.  (8/10)<br /><br />Stupid Things - Released in a slightly different EP-only version, this was the first track I heard. It's whispery autumnal vocals are easier to decode in this album version, but the quaint lyrics match the tone perfectly.  In a lesser band's hands, the lyrics could have come off as corny or contrived; not the case here. (10/10)<br /><br />I'll Be Around - With this track begins the more somber, reflective half of the album.  Sounding as if it was pulled from the original master tapes of And Then Nothing...,  I'll Be Around has the same late-night-drive sensibility that made that album a classic. (7/10)<br /><br />Cornelia and Jane - Georgia takes over the mic on this track and delivers one of her most memorable songs since \\"Nowhere Near\\" (from Painful).  Horns punctuate the song when they need to and sometimes the void is filled with complete silence.  As if pleading to a deeply depressed friend, her vocals are delicate and the despair is haunting.  Like a roller coaster of emotions, this song has its hills and valleys.  (9/10)<br /><br />Two Trains - With a beat sounding oddly reminiscent of the one used on an older song, \\"Saturday,\\" the band takes a different approach with \\"Two Trains.\\"  The heartbeat of this song comes in the form of a lethargic tambourine that appears once every four measures. (8/10)<br /><br />The Point of It - Keeping with the gentler vibe of the latter half of the album, this track sounds like music for a campfire but with much heavier lyrical themes to digest.  Confronting your own mortality and accepting it is a major theme on Fade, but this song gets right to the, well... point of it.  (Sorry, guys!)  (8/10)<br /><br />Before We Run - Epic album closer, \\"Before We Run,\\" was the first official single off of Fade.  In the tradition of many post-rock songs, this track is a slow burner that builds and falls many times and never gets old.  John McEntire's production comes to the fore in this track with very Tortoise-like instrumental layering.  Capping off Fade with sweet but sincere lyrics - \\"Take me to your distant lonely place, take me out beyond mistrust\\" - we are given a reminder of what makes this band so special in the first place. (10/10)<br /><br />Fade is the soundtrack for hitting that point in life where you realize that you have likely lived for more years than you have left.  It's much easier to look backward and dwell on the sparkly nostalgia of years past than it is to blindly trudge forward into the unknown.  With so much uncertainty in the world on every level - relationships, aging, self-doubt - it's easy to sometimes wonder if it's all even worth the struggle, but with bands like Yo La Tengo around to lessen the burden, it serves as a nice reminder that we're all in this together.<br /><br />Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy the album as much as I do.o sometimes wonder if it's all even worth the struggle, but with bands like Yo La Tengo around to lessen the burden, it serves as a nice reminder that we're all in this together.<br /><br />Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy the album as much as I do.

B008602KQI|5.0|A movie cannot stay true to the book.  It would take too many hours to cover all the details found in the book, and nobody can sit and watch a movie that long!  The screenplay was as true to the book as it could be.  Well developed characters, well acted.  LOVED Hamish!
B00006J9OV|5.0|This rendering of Parsifal is close to Knappertsbusch (1951 and 1962) in breadth and spirituality, and of course with this we get visual as well as aural.  The singers do not so much act the parts as live, embody them.  This performance -- what a lame word for what this really is -- is alive.  There are no &#34;weak links&#34; here.  I originally saw this on YouTube and had to order it.  You will not see or hear a more inspired Parsifal.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book reads like a novel, hard to put down. The members of the cabinet are described in detail as well as their wives, children, careers, hopes, successes, failures, disappointments, happiness and suffering. You want to turn the pages continuously to find out what will happen next.<br /> The three main characters are Abraham Lincoln, William Seaward-Secretary of State-foreign affairs and Salmon Chase, Secretary of the Treasury-finance. The author describes all the skills Lincoln had to deploy to get the benefit of the outstanding skills of these remarkable persons. To start with getting them to accept them to join the cabinet was far from easy; they refused as a first reaction. Next, they resigned several times and Lincoln needed creativity to get them to withdraw their resignations.<br /> They never became a team as Lincoln hoped in the beginning. Lincoln concluded that aiming for consensus was not feasible. He listened very intensely to their views, thought deeply and announced his decision that was accepted. One of the methods Lincoln used to reduce tension was to tell amusing stories, always, starting with, \\"This reminds me of...<br /> An example of Lincoln's way of working. Chase continued manipulating public opinion and undermining Seward with the goal to win the next election for President. For example he saw to it that his face was printed on al green one-dollar bills so people would recognize him. In public he praised Lincoln adding that progress could have been achieved more quickly, implying with him in charge. Lincoln was perfectly aware of these manipulations. Chase performance in financing the war and getting the financial system under control was truly outstanding and is described in greater detail in other books. The author describes Lincoln's capability to disregard these manipulations and not become angry or offended by this lack of loyalty.  Lincoln only considered what people could accomplish and not if they were nice to him.<br /> Lincoln had far less experience of governing than his rivals. Fortunately he was an incredibly fast learner. Already after a few months the cabinet members accepted his decisions. This did not work in the conduct of the war with general George McClellan, the head of the armed forces. Lincoln soon realized his weaknesses and studied military strategy, and became quite knowledgeable, but not to the point where he could compensate for the weaknesses of the general. Lincoln also in this case was patient for a long time and accepted McClellan's disloyal and extremely disrespectful behavior. Different from Chase McClellan produced mediocre results. The war would have shortened considerably if Lincoln at an earlier date had replaced McClellan with Ulysses Grant.d far less experience of governing than his rivals.

B00A2IUHM6|1.0|Yep, that's right.  I rented the \\"unrated version\\" and found it to be very annoying.  I didn't think it was very funny at all.  There were a few moments when I smiled, but overall I found it to be juvenile and as I've stated before, annoying.  I'm no prude by any means, but overall this movie just wasn't that funny.  Don't waste your money.

0765325950|5.0|Finally, finally the series is over. Let me just start out by saying I am a fan of Brandon Sanderson's other works. I think he does a great job telling a story, and moving the pace along. I think of him as more of a trilogy writer as opposed to the more expansive epics that Jordan and Martin have popularized ($$$$).<br /><br />That being said, he took on an impossible task of wrangling the plot threads that have been tangling and dangling for over 20 years and produced a satisfying conclusion. He didn't (and couldn't) resolve all the threads in this book, but the big finish is there, and I find it satisfying. Opinions will vary, but I think those who remember the misery of those middle books clearly will be glad to get to AN ending.<br /><br />I'm curious to see if he will return to WoT in the future to cover some of the fallout/omissions, but I can say THANK YOU from all the folks who started this series in the early '90s and didn't think we'd ever see Tarmon Gai'don.
B006YCX01O|5.0|Complaining about the cost of an import is stupid and giving Nina a 1 star rating because you don't like the price is ridiculous.  This is a smashing good time of an album and can be had on e bay if you don't like this price.  Unfortunately not available from iTunes US and I can't figure out how to purchase from the Italian version.  But this is a great album to have if you're a Nina Zili Fan
B004SBX112|1.0|This app wants to track where I am when I want to play Angry Birds.  Really?  Not for me or my family.....Use at you own risk....
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really enjoy this game! I just started and found I want to keep trying and get that perfect score! Addictive, challenging and fun!  Awesome!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|What an awesome read.  Love the surprises.<br />I cannot wait to start on Mockingjay and to see the next movie.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I put this on my Kindle because it looked like a good mindless game. My husband has been on my Kindle more than I have since I installed this app. He even has my 9 year old helping him on it. I have played it some too. We all like it. You get to where you don't want to run out of coins (chances) because you are soooo close to getting that prize. It is just like at the fair, but better because it isn't real money!!
B004SBQGHS|1.0|Amazon is more worried about taking my mony than providing a quality product.  The does not work on my Ematic Android Tablet.  I am just another unhappy Amazon customer.  3 bad apps purchase now and they are just spyware.
B002APU580|5.0|I saw the Colin Firth movie first and although I am a diehard fan of his, I didn't like the actress chosen to play Lizzie.  This movie is so wonderful, staying as close to the original script as possible. Both Keira Knightly and Matthew MacFayden are wonderful actors who bring Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennett to life in such a wonderful, beautiful way. This movie is now my all time favorite!!
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|this game is fun and helps you waste the time away. i just wish that you did not have to buy stuff to get further ahead faster.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. It is great for adults, and for older kids. I played it until I completed all of it, and now my kids (9,7) play it a lot. It is addictive until you finish all of the puzzles it gives you.
B008476HBM|5.0|I can clearly see why anyone who reads English literature has high praises for this story. I enjoyed everything about it. It was well written, well developed, and well presented that it holds the number one spot in my love of books. The tone of the story, the pace of the story, all very pleasing to me. And the language! I highly recommend this story to all who has a love for books.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|These DVD's were great! I loved the extra footage that wasn't shown on television in America. just great. would totally reccomend them.
B00425S1H8|4.0|Great product at a great cost!!! Works with multiple versions of Microsoft OS, including Windows 7. Definitely a great buy.
B00992CF6W|3.0|its ok but it does not even have survival mode it only has creative mode it does not have animals eiether nor mobs or gangs
B0084IG7KC|5.0|The tapes of the Hunger Games are great and I love the background info included in these tapes. I also showed this to some younger students and they loved it as well.
B009SCRERI|5.0|I am a caregiver of children and they LOVE this movie.  I decided to purchase it instead of just renting it.
B005RERB92|5.0|I loved everything about it; the animation, the actors, the story, the music. I haven't seen Shrek 2 or 3.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Real cold case mystery --- Who dunnit and why? The usual motives but comes together in an unexpected way --- I recommend to find out for yourself.
B007712XAU|4.0|I actually loved this tape and I would rate the quality of the tape as a 5, but there is a problem with the packaging and I have contacted you about this, but have had no response.  The tapes are rattling around inside the case as the clips that hold the tape arrived in a broken condition. For the price of this item I surely think one should have a case that will hold and protect them.
0545265355|5.0|Despite of the fact that Suzanne Collins doesn't appear to have much working knowledge in regards to military tactics per se, it's an interesting approach to a world much different to ours. Great read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing! So much more than your typical romance novel. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good love story and some life lessons.
B003XMKMTQ|4.0|I was trying to get hard copy of a Crossroads Festival I saw on PBS. Thought it was this one.
B00005N6KG|5.0|How are you going to beat $9 for a pair of headphones that:<br /><br />1. Don't fall off when you jump/run/plyometrics/hang-clean/etc.<br />2. Sound good (i mean, they aren't going to compare to those fancy noise canceling over the ear ones, but they are fine)<br />3. Can be worn in the rain, dried out, and 9 times out of 10 will work again<br />4. If broken, can be taped into place and work for many more months<br /><br />The only challenge i have ever had with these is during the summer, if i forget a headband, and sweat a bunch on a run - the sweat can pool in your ear and short them out.  So just pull them out of your ear every once in a while and blow the sweat off them; or don't forget the headband, or just shave your head :o)<br /><br />I just ordered my 4th pair in 4 years - i wear them almost daily to workout attached to a sansa-clip MP3 player (which is also super light), i run the wire under my shirt between the mp3 and the headphones so the wire doesn't bounce and it is like they are a part of my head.<br /><br />I have tried all the rest - the big ones annoy the ** out of me with their weight and the slipping off, the \\"in ear\\" ones hurt after a while no matter what kind you get, and those ones that rest behind your head?  I mean seriously, you are going to run with a pair of headphones that bounce?<br /><br />Anyway - i love these things.
B009B8YZKS|4.0|The story is good, yet a bit rushed. There's a few glitches in regards to HALO canon, such as the MJOLNIR the Chief is wearing (which I think should be the Mark II variant as opposed to the Mark III-ish depicted on screen), but an interesting story nonetheless.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was inspirational and funny, loving and sad. I loved it so much and hope to read it again
B000005RS0|5.0|I love this Tina Turner classic! The self titled song Private dancer is a sensual song, What's love got to do with it was a top hit for Tina Turner and still sounds great after all these years,I cant stand the rain is a classic that sounds great with Tina singing it, Show some respect is  great song, along with her cover of the Al Green  hit song Let stay together. I love 1984, better be good to me, I wrote a letter, When I was young, and just all of the songs are GREAT~ If you are a Tina Turner fan than this is a must have for your collection! Its money well spent. There are uptempo, mid temp, and even slow songs... all hot in true Tina Turner fashion!
0143143492|5.0|I am able to see my world differently than before I read the book.I read it before I read  Practicing the Power of Now
B007KQI1NA|5.0|Shipped fast, works really well.  This was a replacement because we broke the original one due to our own fault.  Very durable and accurate.
B004AM5QT4|3.0|It is too predictable. Maybe I have read so many of his works that I can predict or maybe this one just lacks the excitement and terrific writing techniques Mr. Follet is so good at. The characterization is blatant rather than subtle and subversive, making everything a foregone conclusion before it even happens..<br />third Twin is definitely not his best work.
B000002VCQ|5.0|This is the cd that put the late great singer Whitney Houston on the map! Her debut cd is full of great songs that brought back so many memories for me!Hits such as \\"you give good love\\", \\"Saving all my love for you\\", \\"Nobody loves me like you do\\", \\"How will I know?\\" \\" All at once\\", & greatest love of all, among others! It gets no better than this! I played it from start to finish.No skipping songs! This is classic Whitney, and if you are a fan of her than you must get this for your music collection! I am very happy with my purchase~
B009IEXKXI|3.0|A little drawn out in some of the explanations, such as some of the chemistry performed while on mars. This tended to make the book Boring at times ,however still a good read. If you're into  space exploration this is a book to satisfy your imagination.
B00854DT10|5.0|Bought this for a Christmas gift.  Was requested for gift. He was very pleased with it.<br /><br />He said it was a good read and would recommend it
B008NB0SQO|5.0|This is one of my favorite Muppet movies and I babysit for a two year old who likes , correction loves, the Muppets and she loved the movie.  She didn't understand it all but she loves the characters.
0385535139|4.0|Love  most of  Grisham books, but found it to be quite similar to some other novels. Didn't like as much as some others.
B004G6009K|5.0|When I say unmatched animation I mean the characters move and emote more beautifully and expressively than in any other 3d animated film. This film was originally directed by Glenn Keane, the master animator who drew Tarzan, Aladdin and the Beast, and his superior animation knowledge really shows in the movements of all these characters.<br /><br />This is also a very well-made, funny film. My wife, my 7- year old son and I all loved it.<br /><br />I don't like having to buy a 4-disc combo to get 3d, but the 3d is well-done and convincing. So I'd say the price is high, but it's worthwhile to watch.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Bought this for requested Christmas gift for daughter as she is a big Harry Potter fan<br /><br />She enjoyed them very much
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|WE LOVE THIS GAME, ITS A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO PLACE THE PIECES BUY YOU CAN LAUGHT AND HAVE A GREAT TIME WITH YOUR KIDS
B0084IG8TM|5.0|You can't go wrong by watching the incredible Hunger Games movies.  They are full of excitement and thrill.  Get your popcorn ready!
B00AA7O22U|4.0|I, personally, didn't enjoy the movie. However, my boyfriend thought the movie was awesome. He loves all the action and had all his favorite stars.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|purchased for Christmas gift for daughter. She is a big Harry Potter fan<br /><br />Would recommend this if you are a Harry Potter fan
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Though I've barely started reading it, the book IS better than the movie. I look forward to spending time reading it.
0545265355|5.0|This box set was a gift for my nephew for Christmas.  I knew he would like them because he likes reading and this was right up his alley. Unfortunately, I did not know before purchasing them that he had already read them all!
B005R32L66|2.0|I downloaded this for an off brand tablet, unfortunately even though the tablet had a front facing camera, this Skype did not utilize it, making it a phone essentially.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|What a great concept !  Nice visual affects. I like how they made Levitt look and act like a younger Willis.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I like this product because its as simple or as difficult as you want it to be, it is challenging and realistic.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Loved it!<br />It is funny and yet sad at the same time and heart warming with a good old fashioned happy ending, who cannot resisit those?!<br />An insight into loneliness and how difficult it is to meet people after a certain age especially living in a small village in Ireland.<br />Some wonderful characters giving this novel soul.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|warning! this game is highly addictive and you can really lose all track of time. l really love this game!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a great tile game!  The only mahjong game that works right on my tablet.  It responds immediately to my touch.
B008XG1X18|2.0|Not sure what information is available in Pinterest because the program hasn't worked since installed. This problem is experienced much to often with online programs and upsets me. I would NOT recommend this program to anyone.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|This movie could have been awesome.  What I feel like they did, however, was take a really cool idea and throw money at it until it sucked.  The film made no sense.  The plot was so disjointed and clumsy that I got lost several times.  The script was awful as was the acting (except for David, David was neat). Also, and this shouldn't matter but it does, the leading actress is freaking hideous.  From some angles she looks okay, from others she is a complete dumpster fire.  The effects were good and the environment was beautiful, though, hence the 2 stars.
B0017PD2J8|5.0|You will appreciate life so much more after reading this book.  What Victor Frankl and his fellow prisoners went through shows me that with the right frame of mind you can get through anything.
B0039UTDA6|5.0|great show! watched it on tv when it first premired. been looking for it ever since it came out. great price!
B0086700CM|4.0|I might rate this game higher, if my grandsons would let me play it. All 3 fight over who's next. This game occupys their interest for hours. I would recommend that parents at least check it out.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Love, love, LOVE this book! Kept me entertained and reading until the very end! I can hardly wait until the next book comes out!
B009O2XY12|5.0|A nice challenging game. Different levels will make you think a little bit. I like it. It's an entertaining game.
B004GJYROG|4.0|bought it for Christmas for my nephew and he loves this movie!! shows good quality and I got the movie a day early!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I have 3 grandsons (11, 9 and 7) that fight over who will play this game. It also makes a good babysitter.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Excellent, filled with plenty of unexpected twists, hopefully the second season can keep up the pace of the first season.
B00846TTDG|5.0|I highly recommend this movie! The language is a little rough,and it is graphic with violence it is a military movie. However, it depicts clearly the sacrifice and Valor our Military has!
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|Great product.  Great price.  Easy enough for my 9 year old to assemble.  I am very glad to have made this purchase.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What can i say i think this book is erotic but great romance.  I enjoyed all three books and am hoping they come out with more it was a wonderful book to me i know some reviews are not that good all i can say is read it yourself you wob be dissapointed i wasnt
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|I like Bruno Mars a lot. He has a sweet voice. I like most of the songs. I recommend this album.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|In context the movie was good. The acting was great. I didn't realize that the movie was going to go so vivid into detail in some areas and scenes. Quite honestly, it was awkward. I don't think anyone really wanted to see Merle Streep doing some things she did....but that's just me....if you get it, just have your remote handy......
B005H29GSI|5.0|As a child of the 80's, I remember the original On Thin Ice game from my childhood.  When I saw this Angry Birds version, I knew it would be perfect for my son.  In fact, he took it to school today for board game day.  VICTORY!!
B004LWZWGA|3.0|This movie was too long and presented a portrait of Batman that showed him as physically weak.  I didn't care for that.<br /><br />  Tom McRae
B00454U1NS|5.0|I love P!nk. She's amazing and strong. I love most of the songs on this album. I love &#34;F***in' Perfect.&#34; Anyways, great album. The product got here in perfect conditions.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />After reading the polarizing reviews for this book, I had to see for myself, and I'm incredibly glad I did. I really, really enjoyed this story, and it hit my heart in all the right places. Many reviewers criticized the behaviors of the main characters, but this isn't a 'how to' self-help book - it's a novel about two flawed young adults navigating the waters of their love without positive role models to show them how. I think the author did an excellent job of capturing the feel of being a college freshman and the blurry lines that get crossed between friend/lover in that particular environment. Both Abby and Travis behaved true to their characters - regardless of how the reader may feel about those actions.<br /><br />The book wasn't without flaws - the last half was a bit rushed, and took a few unexpected turns that I felt were at times unsteady. Overall, however, it was a truly lovely read. I am intrigued and eager to read Walking Disaster and view the same story from Travis' perspective... this isn't something I've seen done before by an author,  at least not as a second full-length novel, and am looking forward to it.
1451648537|4.0|A NYT best seller this book was purchased as a gift for a relative. It arrived as promised and was enjoyed by the recipient.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I have watched this movie several times and I like it very much.  Aside from being exciting, it presents a true picture of how many people are without morals and are in fact deeply irresponsible.  It presents many human beings as deeply corrupt.  This is how many of us are in the 21st Century.<br /><br />  Tom McRae
B0044KU7KU|5.0|I love My Chemical Romance. Whatever material they put out I'd buy it. I give MCR five stars. Back to the album, it's an awesome album.
B00961ZGQC|1.0|You fooled me once. I thought I could download and own this song, then I find out that I need to use a proprietary player software?!? What a scam!!!
B0084U0IEG|4.0|McEwan is not always an easy read. He is rarely a comfortable read. \\"Sweet Tooth\\" has the best of \\"old\\" McEwan - the distance, the compelling story you can't put down - as well as the best, to date, of the \\"new\\" McEwan, more seductive, more nuanced then even a master of nuance has heretofore been.<br /><br />\\"Sweet Tooth\\" starts with a title that sounds like fluffy romance, and when you start the book, you start on this \\"nice\\", romantic tale - slightly analytical, but basically comfortable, seamless - not at all what you think of when you read McEwan. Also, his narrator is female and he does a more than admirable job writing with a female voice. Things do not stay so mellow, however. They begin to take a slightly uncomfortable turn. The reader begins to recognize that she had been fooled with, lulled into thinking McEwan had written something sweet, perhaps even trite. Ha! Not so. While the set up is good in the way comfort food has an undeniable appeal, things soon begin to turn less wholesome and with this, the reader finds McEwan in top form: The story becomes increasingly but very subtly uncomfortable. It develops roots that lead in different directions, none benign.<br /><br />It is not horror that is McEwan's milieu: It is human nature. And in his hands, this is disturbing enough. In short: \\"Sweet Tooth\\" is a clever, really good read.
B008OTTRXU|3.0|Call me maybe and Good Time are really the only really good ones on here. Other than that it all sounds the same. Every song has that super pop sound to it. Maybe next one will be better.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great way to play the. game. It can be tailored to your skills, and the graphics are very crisp.
0780622650|5.0|Great movie, good quality, crappy snap-case.<br />Basically I bought this so I could get to see Heather Graham whenever I wanted.
B005LW5J9O|3.0|Greenblatt is smart. He writes well. He knows his history and is able to capture the line of this tale as it threaded its way through Western culture and written history, philosophy, etc. Five stars for all this. But! The telling of how Lucretius' philosophy shaped Western thought or modern life is not so clearly told. If you think of other books that take theories or stats and tie them to cultural realities, the links are clear and strong. For me, Greenblatt got lost in the history he clearly loves and knows. I wanted more Lucretius, more poem, more direct connections. In fact, I gave up on the book and went directly to a translation of the original poem. There are lots to choose from: maybe start there.
B0084HJE0S|5.0|Kyle presents an exciting and readable story of the development of the world wide web, from IE6 to Ajax to mobile apps. This is a valuable contribution to both aspiring web developers and investors in new companies of the apps tsunami that is taking w3 tech from browsers to cloud, from phones to cars.

B006OCM0G0|5.0|All the complainers down below all you have to do is TURN OFF IN APP PURCHASES to stop unnecessary spending.<br /><br />This game is fun. It takes time before you're able to keep food out for the customers. But u enjoy teamlavas games. I recommend it. :)
B000BBOUCW|5.0|FINAL FANTASY VII: ADVENT CHILDREN - UMD For PSP - 5 Stars<br /><br />I still like it better than the Complete Edition.<br />When I got this UMD it was rumored (now proven false) that the movie would be exclusively to the PSP; wrong since there are now DVD and Blu-Ray editions. (and the \\"this movie has been modified to fit this screen\\" warning lets you know that this was not the intention in the 1st place)<br /><br />I really liked this movie, even with it's drawbacks:<br />-No chapter selection menu<br />-No extra features whatsoever<br />-And the extremely low volume it plays in (you have to set the volume to max and set the UMD audio option to \\"+2\\", and use headphones to hear what they're saying).<br /><br />All of these due to the UMD format, so I considered getting the DVD version after it's release and I ended up buying the Blu-Ray of the Complete Edition.<br />Even with all the extra scenes included I still watch my UMD and I still prefer the final battle of the Original version rather than the one in Complete.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------<br />EDIT<br />And since apparently I can't make a Review for the Complete Edition Blu-Ray, I will post it here and add a title for each one inside the review itself<br />---------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />FINAL FANTASY VII: ADVENT CHILDREN Complete Edition - BLU-RAY - 4.5 Stars<br /><br />Excellent quality, excellent film, love all the scenes included, why only 4 stars? the final battle.<br /><br />This complete Edition has a lot of extended scenes included in it, and every single one of them is adding to the perfection of the film (the highway chase near the end, kicks the crap out of the whole \\"Normal\\" film by itself), and they are masterly incorporated into the film (I mean the syncing with the original music and story play, it's very well done) that none of my friends believed me when I tried to convince them that this was an extended version ofthe one we saw (the one I also have in UMD format).<br /><br />Along with extended scenes, are some few minor changes in some other ones, like the one of the Battle between Sephiroth and Cloud. It has a lot of extended scenes this battle, but the minor difference is the final blow that Cloud inflicts Sephiroth, it's almost the same but slightly different, and waaaayyyyy better in the original one.<br /><br />They take out the scene in which Cloud disassembles that sword, I take down half a star.
B006O6F4O6|5.0|I ordered this for my nephew for Christmas.  He loves it.  I got it quickly for a great price.  If your kid like batman, you can't go wrong.
B000ID37KO|4.0|I watched this as a kid and it scared me silly. I enjoyed it this time. The ending was lacking though.
B009H442DG|5.0|I like these two!  They put there own twist on old songs that made it fun to listen to.  My favorite is baby it's cold outside!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I don't know why I thought this story would be one of hope. Just when you think Katniss might finally catch a break and not lose everything, she does. This book was an amazing but sad journey. The end is as about as happy as it gets for Katniss. It is the perfect end to the series. To slip off into some melancholic state. I feel drained after reading it. The author's ability to make you feel all of that through a book, speaks for the series itself. I highly recommend these awesomely riveting books. You will not be disappointed!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Had the idea to see the movie after finding out it was a novel I couldn't wait to read it first. So glad I did, this is so heart warning and endearing. A must read !
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  Lot's of twists and turns.  I  also enjoyed all the characters...I hope there's a sequel.
B0041KVZ18|1.0|Update: Just received my replacement copy. This time the second LP was pressed off-center, had a lead-in scratch, and was warped.<br />I will not be buying again, as this record manufacturer obviously has no QC currently in place. The Beatles deserve much better than this!<br /><br />I was skeptical about making this purchase after reading some of the reviews.<br />But hey.....It's the White Album!!!  I was impressed with the sound, unimpressed by the fact that the 1st LP was a bit warped. The \\"jet intro\\" to BITUSSR had an annoying scratch and there were quite a few pops all the way thru side 1.  Didn't even bother taking the 2nd LP out of the sleeve.  I have returned for replacement, giving the record company one more chance. I liked the poster being printed on uncoated paper.  The four pictures were not overly impressive...they appeared to be stretched out a bit in the vertical direction.  The ones from '68 were much nicer.

B0017SWSCW|3.0|Very slow starting book.  Only after you've worked your way through its 1st half or so does it get to be a decent read.

0307463745|5.0|Fried and Hansson take a very direct approach to dispensing basic business advice in this fast, fun read.  They employ a light-hearted, tongue-in-cheek style to share their perspective on the traits and actions which have made their business a success. Rework is one of my favorite books to recommend to those who want to start or improve a business.<br /><br />In a business world which has become focused on growth, profits, and \\"bigger is better,\\" Fried and Hansson take a very different view of how to define success in business. Their advice is often contrary to what you might come across in classic business school curricula, so as with any advice, take theirs in context and use what works for you in your own business.<br /><br />To summarize their advice:<br />1. Take a stand and share your position with people who care. You'll know you're reaching people when some hate you; the rest will love you more for it.<br />2. Make a great product for those people and keep it to the basics. More is not better.<br />3. Stay lean. Fewer product features; fewer employees; fewer financial commitments.<br /><br />What you won't find is this book is a lot of deep research; a detailed historical account; or repetition. They make a point and move on.<br /><br />If you've ever sat in an all-day planning session, read a 100-page employee handbook, or had to review a 100-page business plan for a new product - and thought that there must be a better way - then you will enjoy reading this book.

B009GEN0JO|5.0|its a classic. and the story line incoorparating James Bonds age is great. However it does not have the same feel in the beging because they could not use the clasic james bond theam music due to it being copy righted under eon productions. but it was nice to see a new version of thunderball. Love the under sea cave, the world domination game, the tears of alia neclace. Very interesting take on the same novel of thunderball.

B00364K6YW|5.0|This is one of our favorite movies. It's nice to have it divided into the 6 hour-ish segments so that it can be enjoyed over a few evenings, or not, as desired. (You can choose to play it straight through). The character development is exceptional. The DVD itself we have no complaints about. Good color, no skipping, no problems so far.

B005S9EJ14|5.0|First of all, who doesn't love the cast in this movie!  But, for me, having recently been to India for the first time, it was like going back there.  Wonderful story with characters that are very real; the petulant, cranky, ailing Maggie Smith and the bereaved Dame Judi are just marvelous, as always.  A wonderful feel-good movie that will leave you smiling long after the closing credits!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I read plenty of negative reviews recently on this Seiko watch, it MIGHT lose 5-10 mins a week, but if you can't reset your watch, you shouldn't have one... This watch is not only extremely functional, it's also very good looking and quite a buy at 70 bucks. I would recommend this watch to anyone.

B0062P332Y|5.0|I loved this movie.  Jason Statham is at his usual action self.  Even better that it was based on actual real events.  I don't care for Clive Owens or his  moustache but Jason overshadowed him so no big deal.

B007V65R54|1.0|Anyone with a passing interest in statistics knows most of what's in this book. Endless padding with stories from the authors conversations and background reading. Way too much baseball (what % of the English_reading public follow this sport? What would US readers think if English authors wrote about Cricket that has billions of fans).<br /><br />This would have been much better as an article. The usual book bloat from someone cashing in on his temporary fame.

B009VL28W2|5.0|I heard others saying the sound quality wasn't that great, they have bad hearing. That's the only thing I can think of that would give them any reason to give such a review. Although I agree with the older fans (or simply those that love the older Metallica), James just doesn't have the voice for the older, aggressive songs; this is still a great performance by the old guys. Instrumentally, they still have the talent. As for vocals, you're just going to have to get use to the newer sound, James is older and no longer drunk. So no more aggression! YAY! =(((

B005WUHAX8|4.0|The lifeproof works at first, but a little normal use makes it useless. I have had a lifeproof case come out of the box broken, but if they are new the first month is great. I have yet to drop my phone, but the waterproof seal isn't functioning anymore. I re-did the waterproof test and it failed. This isn't a huge issue cause I can send in the case and get a replacement, but I don't want to have to send in my phone case once a month. I'd say lifeproof is a good cheap insurance, I'm not worried when it rains hard, but its not great for what they say it is.

0670024813|2.0|This book is a big missed opportunity.<br /><br />Sure, it's well enough written and all - Jared Diamond is a Smart Guy, after all. But in his overview of what aboriginal and traditional cultures might have to teach us modern, civilized folks, Diamond makes the enormous flaw (so typical of all those Smart Guys in the scientific-academic world) of ignoring arguably the most important aspect of any group of peoples: their inner world - their modes of perception and their states of being. These hard-to-articulate, impossible-to-objectively-study, but crucial aspects of life are often most explicitly expressed in traditional peoples' stories, rituals, dances, initiatory rites, totemic societies, and healing practices; but they are also reflected in virtually all other areas of life as well - from the way they build their houses to the way they make their tools to the way they gather, prepare, and distribute their food to the way they arrange their marriages and family lives, and on and on. The crucial point is that you cannot fully or meaningfully understand any aspect of a culture until you understand this \\"inner\\" aspect. What we can see strictly from the outside - the objective-mechanical level of life - never allows us to fully and correctly understand what we think we are seeing.<br /><br />Diamond's singular focus on the objective-mechanical level is not a mere choice, as in, \\"Well, I didn't have time and space to write about everything, so I just picked a few topics - and perceptual modes/states of being just happened to not be one of them.\\" No - this \\"choice\\" exactly reflects and reinforces a deep-seated and (usually) unconscious, unacknowledged cultural bias. The \\"missed opportunity\\" is precisely that of freeing ourselves from our unacknowledged biases. And isn't this one of the primary values - if not THE primary value - of studying and learning from our aboriginal-traditional kin? Only by seeing our most deeply held, unconscious biases can we learn what is truly universal in human nature versus what is specific to this or that culture. Even if we decide, in the end, that we like and want to keep our cultural biases, if we are at least open to seeing them, we can become aware how they might negatively influence and limit us - and can maybe take some steps to counter any undesirable/unintended consequences (like, say, the rampant mental illness that seems to accompany modern life, just to toss just one thing out there). But when we cannot see our biases, we have no freedom of choice. Blind biases bind us without our even knowing it.<br /><br />From Diamond's book, you would think that all aboriginal and traditional peoples around the world live in the same basic perceptual mode and state of being as ourselves. And that they therefore share our same basic worldview - the worldview that has actually only very recently (relatively speaking) become prevalent even in modern, westernized (objectivistic, materialistic, mechanistic, secular) society - the worldview that tells us, \\"Life is a struggle for physical survival.\\"<br /><br />struggle  physical  survival<br /><br />Each of those words is massively culturally loaded. And so, although any group of humans at any time and in any part of the world would certainly have been able to understand that there is an aspect of life that can be viewed in these terms, it is doubtful that any humans, except relatively modern, civilized ones, would have characterized life as a whole in anything even close to these terms. \\"Struggling for physical survival\\" is a modern, civilized hang-up.<br /><br />Traditional lifeways - from their birthing practices right through to death - reflect and reinforce in so many ways an awareness of a much larger, more personal, innately meaningful world of experience, participation, and relationship that goes far beyond mere survival. This larger world has to be described as being both \\"in here\\" (inside our selves) and \\"out there\\" (in the outer world) because these \\"two\\" realms, which have become sharply split apart in the civilized world, still maintain their organic, holistic unity in traditional cultures. In our split between inner and outer, we modern folks cannot even begin to imagine (or remember, really - we all did know similar worlds/states of being as very young children) what this wider inner/outer universe is like - and the perceptions and states of being to which it gives rise. It is in this civilized split that the strictly \\"physical\\" aspect of the world - with its nasty, brutish struggle for survival - looms so obliteratingly large in our view.<br /><br />Nonetheless, \\"Life is a struggle for physical survival\\" is the blanket assumption that Diamond starts with (although he never makes it explicit; but hey, \\"We all know it's true,\\" right?). This is the lens through which he views, interprets, and evaluates every other culture on the planet. Everything that people do, then, is \\"good/useful\\" if it can ultimately be shown to directly promote physical survival/adaptation; and it is \\"bad/harmful\\" if it appears to do anything else. That is the ultimate - and only real - criteria. Never mind that larger world out there/in here and our ability to participate in it.<br /><br />And so - presto-magico - Diamond comes to the conclusion, time and time again, that, although traditional cultures might have a thing or two to teach us (hey, he's an Open Minded Guy, too) that could improve our struggle for physical survival a little bit - you now, smooth out a rough edge here and there - modern civilization is really just, well, way better - objectively speaking, of course.<br /><br />In other words, this is another one of those smug, self-congratulatory books cranked out by civilized academia, which, as usual, doesn't know what it doesn't know - and couldn't care less.<br /><br />That's my main, general take. Below, I'll address a few specific areas - childbirth, violence, and religion - but it will all be pretty much in linewith what I've said above.<br /><br />Childbirth<br />Diamond's shockingly ignorant treatment of birthing practices is almost criminally negligent. This was where I had to really begin questioning if he had any serious intent to find areas where we could learn anything of significance from traditional peoples. He dedicates one single page to this crucial topic, makes no reference to the huge amount of research that has been done on this, and does not so much as hint at the important issues at stake. One of the four paragraphs on the topic describes a Piraha woman being left unaided to die in childbirth. Since this description constituted ¼ of his total discussion of childbirth, the implication is that this is typical of traditional childbirth. It is not (and incidentally, it is very doubtful that anyone in her culture would have been able to help the Piraha woman in question). Just for comparison, he spends far more time in other chapters on really important topics like letting us know that it's possible to die by falling out of tall trees, by getting a disease, or by not getting enough food to eat; and that it is best to avoid these and other causes of death as much as possible. Striking new insights.<br /><br />Violence<br />Then there is the nonsense about traditional people being more violent than us  - a claim made largely on the basis that their ratio of violent deaths per capita is higher than ours, when averaged out over long periods of time. Now, I'm no statistician; but it seems to me that these figures really just compare the number of violent deaths to the rate at which people successfully reproduce themselves. So sure, we civilized people are way better at re-(over)populating after we exterminate countless numbers of people in our oft-repeated acts of psychotic horror; but comparing these two numbers tells us virtually NOTHING about how \\"violent\\" people are.<br /><br />How violent people are has to do with much more than statistics. It has also to dowith less easily quantifiable factors - those pesky, unscientific, subjective factors. In our culture, we consider a soldier to be less violent than a school shooter, even if the soldier kills many more people. The soldier may even be considered a valiant hero. This is because of our understanding of the differing internal motivations of the two individuals. And yet we presume to compare ourselves and to say who is more violent - us or traditional peoples - based only on statistics, without any real understanding of how they conceive of violence in their own lives and worldviews.<br /><br />Also, as is quite typical of scholarly books in this vein, Diamond's discussion of violence never so much as mentions the kind of violence that I may be perpetrating right now, writing this review on my Apple product, sitting at a desk and chair, and wearing clothes all of which I know are very likely to have been made using resources (energy, mineral, plant) extracted through much violence and made by people forced into near slavery who would be shot down without hesitation if they protested their oppression too seriously. Our whole way of life rests on enormous amounts of implicit, threatened, hidden, off-camera violence that will never show up in the kinds of statistics Diamond uses. In contrast, although New Guinean tribal peoples might live in some amount of fear (not that it ever seemed to stop them from traveling long distances to help Diamond with his bird-watching expeditions) - an amount probably comparable to what any of us would feel walking around a city at night - they live their lives as sovereign, free individuals to an extent that is, again, unimaginable to most civilized people. There is nothing in traditional life - not even in their versions of \\"slavery\\" - that is comparable the huge masses of civilized people living in bleak, hopeless, violent oppression and utterly meaningless wage slavery in order to keep a few of us in the first world happy and fat.<br /><br />Do we even need to mention the extreme, never-before-seen violence we are inflicting on other species and the environment as a whole?<br /><br />Finally on this topic, my sister, hearing about the Piraha woman, pointed out the huge numbers of people in our own American society whose pleas for medical care are ignored, and who sometimes die as a result, often after insurance companies suddenly kick them off their plans the moment they get sick - after having taken their money for years.<br /><br />I have to say, I have literally read better, more in-depth discussions of this topic in the comments sections of online reviews on this webite.<br /><br />Religion<br />Finally, even traditional religion is interpreted through the same narrow, distorting cultural lens discussed in the first part of this review. \\"What are the `functions' of religion?\\" Diamond wonders. But only a civilized mind stuck in survival mode could formulate such a question. Traditionally, there was nothing called \\"religion\\" that was separate from all other (\\"mundane\\") aspects of life. What we would label their \\"religions\\" were simply the aspects of their ways of life that kept them connected to that inner quality or mode of perception, connection, participation, and being that is meaningful and valuable precisely because it has no \\"function\\" beyond the experience itself. That this sort of \\"religion\\" also coincided with and served practical, social-economic-survival functions only shows how organically integrated all aspects of traditional life were. It wasn't \\"added on\\" because of its usefulness. And if their perceptions of the world in these states of being do not always correspond to the findings of our strictly physical sciences, but do help them to connect back to those innately valuable states of being (from which modern people have become alienated and about which we have almost no knowledge), who is to say whose view of reality is more \\"truthful?\\"<br /><br />And never mind that Diamond seems unfamiliar with the basic ways in which aboriginal \\"religious\\" beliefs differ from civilized ones; in all of Diamond's attempted rationalistic explanations of traditional religion, he never once considers the possibility that, because of their different ways of life, traditional peoples might be open to perceptual modes and states of being that reveal aspects of reality no longer accessible to us. Using their unique cultural metaphors and mytho-poetic modes of expression, they may actually be describing real, valuable experiences of reality. These might be extremely significant things we could really learn from. But no - all the possible explanations Diamond considers just happen to be ones that point to the superiority of our civilized, mechanistic, objectivist (that means \\"bias free!\\") perspective and way of life. Yeay us. We're #1. As usual.<br /><br />I'm updating my review on 3/19/13 to add that Morris Berman's book, Wandering God (see separate review) does a great job exploring exactly what I criticized Diamond for misleadingly not exploring: the inner state-of-being of hunter-gatherers. Berman does an excellent job of this, shows how valuable such exploration can be, and shows why it would make such a difference to what Diamond is saying.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This case has been on two different Kindles over the past year.  It has a tactile feel of soft rubber, which helps for grip and absorbs any type of impact should you drop the device.  The elastic closure loop is easy and conveniently holds the front cover open, when completely open.  The main two differences between this and the other cheaper versions of this type of case cover product are the soft felt lining that is on the inside of the front cover (shelters the screen from any scratches) and the fact that the front cover can be COMPLETELY folded back on itself.  My mother's case is this same design, but she can't fold it over on itself and it is ANNOYING. The stand works as well as any of these cases do on a flat surface.  I will continue to buy this type of case for all my future tablet purchases.

Wish it were a bit more sturdy but it is LEGOs we are talking about. It took me about 5 hours total to build. I'm begging for the Taj Mahal for myself.

B008TRUDAS|5.0|I first heard of Colleen Hoover through Facebook. One of my friends recommended her new book, Hopeless, to another friend. I looked up Hoover and seen she is the author of three YA books: Slammed, Point of Retreat, and Hopeless. I bought Hopeless for my Kindle and loved it (review for Hopeless coming soon) and decided to order paperbacks of Slammed and Point of Retreat (Slammed #2).<br /><br />Slammed drew me in from the very beginning. The characters are so likeable and well-written, and the storyline is excellent. I don't want to talk about what happens in the story because it was that good. I don't want to ruin anything that happens in this book for potential readers. Please do yourself a favor and buy this book! You will also want to purchase the sequel, Point of Retreat. It was excellent also (review to come for Point of Retreat). It is also my understanding there will be a third book to wrap up the story of Will and Layken. I am really looking forward to the third book and according to Hoover's website will be released later on this year.

B004LWZWGK|4.0|To start off, you're not going to get a Dark Knight with this movie. Which is a good thing. We've already seen Dark Knight, and it is spectacular.<br /><br />What you get, really, is an epilogue.<br /><br />This is the Godfather 3 of the batman movies.<br /><br />Batman Begins deals with the formation of the hero, just like Godfather 1 does. You see him struggle, his growing pains, him rising to meet challenges.<br /><br />Dark Knight shows Batman at the height of his powers. When he single-handedly disrupts the drug deal, that's in many ways like Michael Corleone demonstrating his power by saying, \\"my offer is this: nothing, not even the fee for the license.\\"<br /><br />Now, when you are in the prime of life, things move fast. You make decisions, often out of arrogance, often without full information. In the 2nd of the series, the decision that Batman makes is to create a lie of a heroic Dent so that the criminals would stay behind bars. The decision that Michael makes is to kill Fredo.<br /><br />So now we arrive at the 3rd movie. Here we see them grappling with their decisions. Michael Corleone is wracked with guilt from killing his brother. He is saddened by the loss of his relationship with Kay. Batman is crippled due to the injuries sustained in Dark Knight. He mourns Rachel. He and Gordon are finding it harder and harder to sustain the lie of the heroic Dent.<br /><br />But the world doesn't stay still. New, younger and talented players enter the scene. Catwoman and Andy Garcia's character.<br /><br />Like Godfather 3, there's something missing from Dark Knight Rises. It doesn't have anywhere near the intensity of Dark Knight. The storyline meanders. The dialogue is missing a lot of its poetic elegance. There are a lot of ideas stuffed into here, and it's a bit much to digest. The actors too seem to have this smirking, \\"look, I'm in a Batman movie\\" attitude to them. Everything seems just a little bit slower in here.<br /><br />My biggest annoyance with the film actually is the new \\"batwing.\\"<br /><br />The Tumbler is part of what made the first two films so effective. The Tumbler is a real car that can travel at 110 MPH. So in everything the Tumbler does, it's like an embodiment of the inspiration behind Nolan's take on Batman. It is where the rubber meets the road. It's all improbably, but not impossible. When you watch the Tumbler roar around, it's thrilling because it's real.<br /><br />The Batwing is impossible. It is clearly CGI. It cannot fly in real life. The aerodynamic shape of the thing, and the size of the thrusting fan, make this thing impossible to fly. you could say that the CGI Batwing is an embodiment of the Dark Knight Rises. It is a loss of creative discipline, as you see Nolan breaking many of his self-imposed rules, such as no Robin. At the same time, the Batwing...does have more capabilities than the Tumbler. It can literally soar higher. And so Dark Knight Rises is the grandest of the 3 films.<br /><br />The first two films are in my opinion better films. But this one has a soul of its own and is worth appreciating.
B008Y5OWMK|5.0|Cimino always did have grandiose ideas, even 'Thunderbolt & Lightfoot' allows us to see the slow death of youth set against the western plains and as for his great study of working class morality, 'The Deer Hunter', maybe there never was such a portrait of families at war; at war with themselves, at war with capitalism, at war with the American dream, at war with their perceived destiny.<br />So, at last, here we are allowed to see 'Heaven's Gate' in all its sumptuous, bloody glory. like John Ford, Cimino is interested in community best exemplified by the dance. The film's opening sequence ends with a dance performed and shot with all the Euclidean glory of Busby Berkeley and the sweeping grace of Ford's dancers in 'She Wore A Yellow Ribbon', 'The Searchers' and 'My darling Clementine'. This motif of the circular dance allows Cimino to explore the forms of social being that are being forged in this fin de siecle  dusk, where the wild west gives way to the exploited west.<br />To follow the odyssey of a single (singular) man as he shifts from the east to the west from the ruling elite to the multitude of the working class is to render the these states as united, united by geography but not yet by ideology. The psychosis of greed and its preening narcissistic practitioners are perfectly articulated by the sweep of the director's vision. Cimino manages a large cast and the glorious landscape that function as a stage in which the dramas are played out with aplomb, the settlers mean shacks, the' Heaven's Gate' ballroom, the night time scenes, reminiscent of those wonderful photographs of O. Winston Link and the mandatory sight of figures on horseback kicking up dust are rendered all of a piece, this is what it is to make the mythos of the west one that functions by speaking to us of a vision.<br />If there is such a place as 'America', then it can be found in this kind of cinema, sumptuous in its grandeur, poetic in its detail.

B00003CXRM|5.0|Brilliant film! Amazingly well acted and directed.  Great story, very cleverly told with lashings of humour.  Great characterisations.  Altogether a 'keeper'.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I just love the product. It is so easy to watch the charging process and to determine the remaining charge time.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|This movie wasnt really what I thought it would be but it was very interesting.. Had alot of funny moments and some sad ones too... every couple who has been married and is or has gone through this should see this movie...
B008K5T5AI|3.0|This was quite a whimsical novel for Banks - definitely &#34;hard&#34; sci-fi - it was more concerned with ideas than character or storyline. The ideas were, as usual for Banks, really interesting, but the novel as a whole, while enjoyable, didn't grab me the way some of his others did.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game.  keeps me occupied on the subway for the entire ride. Would definitely recommend to others.  Purchased the complete game :)
B007XIC1GI|5.0|Funny and well articulated, would recommend this book to anyone of my friends. I especially enjoy drugs, sex, and violence

0711986746|1.0|This is one of the most one sided, self serving books I have every read.  It was also extremely boring!

B000VYX8PE|5.0|Very good not at all to mature for little kids<br />I thought I might get scared but it is not scary at all also short
B00ARAO720|1.0|Awful. About as exciting as watching someone play a video game. I'd give it zero stars if that we're an option.
B0072GPQ72|5.0|Great, great, great movie. Another true incident that took place during a war. The girls will enjoy it too. A gorgeous horse.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Great game.  Hours of fun.  Continues to be fun as there are many different levels.  It never seems to get old.

0393327345|5.0|Sure everyone's seen the movie.<br />But, the book goes much deeper!<br />ending is way different than the movie!<br />I'd tell you more but, I can't break the first two Rules of fight club!
B002O0KUXG|2.0|I wasn't able to get this to work like I wanted it too. I finally gave up and put it a box.

B00899DR40|5.0|I love listening to Justin Bieber. My daughter got me listening to him. His songs are really great and have good beats to it
B000GPI2EK|4.0|Okay, either you like Mastodon, or you hate them. There doesn't seem to be a middle ground.<br />I like them, and I like this album.<br />However there are a few problems,<br />The mix goes a little screwy in places.<br />And the vocals aren't always mixed right. But I still like it... You'd need more than a few psychedelics to completely grasp all the references and Imagery,( and maybe the guys in the band should've abstained from said substances during the mixing session)<br />But it remains a solid extreme Progressive metal album.
B00005JL0I|4.0|Casino Royale British spoof/humor... no wonder it's \\"unofficial\\" earlier rendition! LOL    I hate British humor/movies/television/accent... Don't know why.    This is DEFINITELY WORTH SEEING though. Like The Benny Hill Show, it's a spoof w/too many silly garter belts and British pompous puke. Therefore, it is no surprise it is considered \\"Unofficial\\". Of course, the later Bond, that we all enjoy so much, is sophisticated and tenacious, refined and intelligent... all qualities poked at by this version of the Pink Panther type romp here!    BUT! YOU MUST SEE THIS! It really does something, by filling in the history of the Bond story, and highlights what could have happened to it. Bond likely would not have lasted this long, if this type of twist were adopted as the permanent Bond fiasco! LOL    I mean, look at the list of stars in this thing. No wonder it is what it is! We have a Pink Panther already; so, thank EON for make the current Bond what he is!    It's kind of like taking a s*** and looking to find pieces of corn in it - and the first time marvel of it. But, then, you're really glad that doesn't happen much! LOL    I'm afraid to watch the 1954 version. The guy on the cover - Barry Nelson? - looks like an ordinairy British Dick (cop).    I give it a 4 star because of the historical value; so, it is a MUST SEE film! And, well worth the price! All British stuff usually gets 1-3 star from me, no matter what. But, this is really important - and cheap! LOL
B006LSZECO|4.0|At first I wasn't sure I like it,but the more I read the more I like the book gone girl. It  started off slow but pick up half way though.
B009DKCBM8|5.0|The songs and videos were just great. Took me back to my younger days when psychedelic highs were appreciated and not feared. I must say, though, did anybody else have playability problems with their blu-ray? Had to return the first one and am still having some problems with the second. Stop encrypting these discs to the point where they won't play.
B00984668E|5.0|A great, solid album by a great doom metal band! I love every song on here, no filler, all hard riffing killer.<br />If ancient druids listened to heavy metal they'd rock The Sword all day and night !

B007V65R54|5.0|I really enjoyed it and how well it ties in the theories and philosophy of predictions that run behind books like Moneyball, etc. It was well written and humorous,and managed to be educational without being pedantic.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Well... it's a very nice app, but really needs more features if you want to get a very nice 5 star rating out of me
B003EYVXTG|3.0|I liked the movie but when I placed the DVD in my player it made a loud (almost moaning) sound for a couple of minutes but then it went away only to start again at the beginning of the movie for a couple more minutes.  This was a brand new movie...never used so I don't know what the problem is.  When the sound first began, I took the movie out and placed another one in my DVD player to see if that was the problem but it was not.  It's the new DVD itself.
B001C3I4UM|5.0|Even when I first bought this album thirty years ago, I knew it would remain a classic-with rich melodies and poignant harmonies abundant. Knights in White Satin will always remain one of the great love songs ever recorded.
B004DM0UII|1.0|I don't know about the product but it was IMPOSSIBLE to download. Amazon downloads. Get your act together. Google Playstore is so much easier to use
B0052AC8C6|1.0|When I first heard about this movie, I was dying to see it. So, it came to theaters and I went to see it. It was the worst movie I have ever seen. It is not funny in anyway and basically revolves around death. I did not find this suitable for children, and I normally do not feel that way about movies. I would not recommend this movie for anyone. I did not enjoy it as an adult and my child sister did not enjoy it as a child. A waste of my money, in my opinion.
B0031RS4UM|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Felt like I was living the adventure with Jack. Just started Tripwire, hope it doesn't disappoint.
B008RTE08E|4.0|The year was 1967, and the Fab Four (also known as The Beatles) were at the pinnacle of their career.  They had just solidified their position atop the music world with the ground-breaking \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\\" For their next project, they decided to make their third film, \\"Magical Mystery Tour,\\" in conjunction with the album of the same name. Their feelings of musical immortality led to the creation of a movie that would have no script; they would gather the cast, and along with a film crew would take a bus tour of England's countryside, filming whatever scenes and moments the four young men decided were worthy of taping. The self-directed movie was premiered on the BBC1 on Boxing Day (December 26th) in black and white, and the commercial uproar prevented a U.S.  release, and very limited distribution throughout the world.<br /><br />Yet now we can enjoy this cinematic fantasy in glorious color, as it has been restored and remixed for a new release. The improvised story provided opportunities for the Beatles to stretch their skills, as Paul McCartney handled much of the direction, and Richard Starkey (Ringo Starr) is not only credited with being the Director of Photography, but he is the dominantly featured actor of the quartet.<br /><br />The songlist included the classic title track, along with \\"Fool On The Hill,\\" \\"Your Mother Should Know,\\" and the iconic \\"I Am The Walrus,\\" with the infamous film footage of the band performing on an abandoned airstrip in Kent singing in fur coats and animal masks.<br /><br />The many Bonus Features include brand new interviews with McCartney and Starr, along with old quotes from both George Harrison and John Lennon.  Sir Paul provides a Director's Commentary, and there is an informative segment on the additional cast members.  This rare vision of the Beatles at the height of their collective success is a must have for any collector or fans of the young men from Liverpool.

1590171993|5.0|A masterpiece. That is all you need to know. The only reason I say more is to reach the word minimum for this review.
B0091LRZZW|4.0|When one is the most successful musician from the most successful pop group of all time, one has carte blanche to pursue any projects you want. In this instance, the artist is Sir Paul McCartney, and the project is a live concert from the acclaimed Capitol Studios building in Los Angeles to promote his new recording of oldies, \\"Kisses on the Bottom.\\"<br /><br />Titled \\"Live Kisses,\\" McCartney performs tracks from the above mentioned recording, featuring classics from his childhood, as well as two new original pieces written in the style of these golden standards.  With a band led by jazz pianist Diana Krall, and featuring first-string musicians John Pizzarelli on guitar, bassist John Clayton, drummer Karriem Riggins, and his touring drummer, Abe Laboriel Jr., on backing vocals, McCartney appears at ease in front of this exclusive audience, where he performs his set in the famous location where Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Nat King Cole made some of their most well-known records.  Director Jonas Akerlund filmed the intimate evening almost entirely in black and white, and adds some tasteful special effects to enhance the mood of the film.<br /><br />With his superstar status firmly established, the 70-year-old McCartney has very little left to prove at this junction in his life, deciding to explore the melodies of his youth on this latest set. The song choices that he made, along with Krall and producer Tommy LiPuma, range from Fats Waller's \\"I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter\\" (where the lyric \\"Kisses on the Bottom\\" comes from) and \\"My Very Good Friend the Milkman,\\" to the lesser known \\"More I Cannot Wish You\\" from Frank Loesser's stage version of \\"Guys and Dolls,\\" and the Harold Arlen and Johnny Mercer standard, \\"Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive.\\"  McCartney's gracefully-aged voice lends itself well to the tunes, and though the set list is a bit ballad-heavy, his band blends wonderfully within the arrangements.<br /><br />Bonus Features include behind-the-scenes footage for the making of \\"My Valentine,\\" one of the McCartney originals on the album.  Featuring Johnny Depp and Natalie Portman (who also appeared in McCartney's \\"Dance Tonight\\" video), fans will enjoy the informal interaction between the actors and the songwriter.-the-scenes footage for the making of \\"My Valentine,\\" one of the McCartney originals on the album.  Featuring Johnny Depp and Natalie Portman (who also appeared in McCartney's \\"Dance Tonight\\" video), fans will enjoy the informal interaction between the actors and the songwriter.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I found the book to be quite compelling and interesting.  I thoroughly enjoyed the way the different parts are written in a different style, and in many cases a different voice.<br /><br />However, for the young Christian reader, or anyone young in their faith, parents should know that while the language and content of this book are not terribly offensive (there are some characters that engage in imoral behavior, but it is integral to the story and bears it's fruits accordingly), the underlying message is distinctly eastern likely Buddhist in it's thinking.  While for the well grounded adult Christian this would prove little harm to their faith, a young reader could very easily get caught up in the messages of reincarnation, karma, and the various passages where Christianity is shown in poor light.<br /><br />All in all a great story, and I highly recommend it to adults who are well grounded in their faith, whatever that faith may be.

B009FB3WQ4|3.0|MusiCares, established in 1989 by The Recording Academy, was created to provide essential services to music people in times of need. Each year, MusiCares presents a Person of the Year Tribute Concert to honor those who have generously given to support their cause.  The 2011 honoree was the legendary Barbra Streisand, and the evening was recorded and is being made available for purchase, with all the proceeds going to MusiCares.<br /><br />\\"A MusiCares Tribute to Barbra Streisand\\" presents many of today's most notable performers interpreting some of Streisand's classic hits. Highlights from the concert include songstress Leona Lewis' straight ahead interpretation of Streisand's 1984 recording of \\"Somewhere\\" from the musical \\"West Side Story;\\" an appropriately titled version of the standard, \\"Smile,\\" performed by the always happy Tony Bennett; a wailing arrangement of \\"Come Rain or Come Shine,\\" featuring the eclectic trio of LeAnn Rimes, gospel mainstay BeBe Winans, and guitar legend Jeff Beck; and a rousing version of \\"People,\\" the Bob Merrill and Jule Styne classic made famous by Barbra in the 1964 Broadway production of \\"Funny Girl,\\" with Stevie Wonder getting the audience on their feet while exchanging riffs with trumpeter Arturo Sandaval.<br /><br />Not all of the performances are rousing: Barry Manilow's attempt to be youthful doesn't quite hit the mark during his rendition of the Andrew Lloyd Webber anthem, \\"Memory;\\" Faith Hill, though always well-coiffed, appeared out-of-place attempting the Stephen Sondheim penned, \\"Send in the Clowns;\\" and Streisand's \\"mini-me,\\" Lea Michele, tries to milk every note she can out of \\"My Man,\\" written exclusively for the \\"Funny Girl\\" film. Fortunately, the concert ends with the madam herself performing an outstanding version of \\"Windmills of Your Mind,\\" written by her frequent beneficiaries Marilyn and Alan Bergman, and \\"The Promise (I'll Never Say Goodbye).\\"  The recording is worth the investment: the money goes to a good cause and you get two performances by Streisand herself.e and you get two performances by Streisand herself.

B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Raunchy, funny, great story. MILA KUNIS -- what more can I ask? Not much! Lots of fun! Highly recommended if you have a real sense of humor and are not some overly sensitive &#34;politically correct&#34; a-hole.
B006RXQ8RI|4.0|Amidst the mindless violence that is captured in this film there is a subtle and elegant beauty between the storyline and the way Tarantino portrays it. Tarantino's style of filming is pushed into full throttle when it comes to kill bill; the sound track is great and merged perfectly from scene to scene. Tarantino did a great job of merging animation into the film and also the cut scenes where it goes black and white. Overall I would say this is a solid film, definitly noteworthy for the way it brings Kung fu movies to the 21st century
0425263908|5.0|Books like this that explore sexuality in an entertaining and adult way are going to set a generation of women free.  Sex is no longer something that happens only in the master bedroom between 10 and 11 PM with the lights out.  I am all for it.

Every time i thought i could put it down to do laundry or run to the grocery store, Wham.....another plot twist.  One of those emotional books you sometime have to set down for a moment to catch your breath.  Fabulous!

B005LAJ1O0|3.0|I LOVED the premise behind thius show, and the clever trweaking of horror conventions, but the denouement absolutely ruined it. The last episode had more false endings than The Lord of the Rings, and each one was cornier and more ridiculous than the last, reducing the show to a comic parody of what it started off being. I encourage you to watch it none-the-less - just don't expect the creators to have come up with a decent ending.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|The movie is very well done.  The colors and sound are great.  The story line is clever.... although I don't quite understand why the kangaroo is such an unhappy kangaroo.  My girls love this movie, so it gets 5 stars!

I put the book down and returned to it later but it still was fairly bland to read.  I will find another gift for my friend.
B009P5S11G|3.0|First I want to say that I am a Rihanna Fan have purchased all over her previous albums and have them in constant rotation, but Unapologetic unfortunately will not be one of those. I was not impressed with many of the songs on this album. There are probably three or four songs that I really enjoyed, Diamonds, Stay (Feat. Mikky Ekko), Numb (Feat. Eminem), and Nobody's Business (Feat. Chris Brown). The rest of the songs on the album sound like one big continuos mediocre song, which Is really disappointing because I love everything Rihanna does. Heres hoping that the next album goes the direction of Loud and Talk That Talk.

B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is definitely different than most books I usually. I only read it because there were so many good reviews.<br /><br />It definitely kept my interest the whole way through. And there were a lot of unexpected twists. Not the most believable ending but it was still worth the read.<br /><br />I would recommend this book!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Ladies and Gentlemen please keep arms and legs inside the cart at all times. If you have any loose items please make sure they are secured. Do not attempt to stand until the ride comes to a complete stop. That is exactly how I have felt for the past nine days.<br /><br />To say this book is terrific doesn't do it justice, to say it is awesome just doesn't do it either. I am totally astonished at this book. It touches on every emotion in the human body.<br /><br />All I can manage to say about this book is it is the most intense, gut wrenching, heart breaking, swoon worthy book I have ever read.
B000FSME1A|5.0|Brando at his best!  This movie should make you open your eyes in ways never imagined.  Great dialogue and great actors makes this movie a must have!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|my daughter purchased this book for her kindle. She said its a great book but its sad. She did enjoy it and it was a great price
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I'm only half way through the second book and it's great. I can't wait for the other movies to release. I don't even need to finish the series to tell you how good this series is.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Definitely a series that could be read over and over! Just went you think it's starting to relax something completely unexpected happens and it keeps you reading till you get done. Not a book that is easy to put down!
1419702963|5.0|My son has collected all of these fabulous books...the moral(s) of the storyline help with children who need a little boost in the confidence and reading.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|My daughter saw this in the cinema, and wanted it for Christmas.<br /><br />She has seen it 3 times already.<br /><br />It arrived earlier than expected, in good packaging and in perfect condition.
0345803507|5.0|Didn't want it to end...what more can I say? I really enjoyed these books and these characters , ALOT !
B00846WWVM|3.0|This is a very cool game. My family loves it. It works well and it makes you think. I'm not a big big game player but thus game make you want to play. Its hard to put it down.
B008OGJXJ6|5.0|What can I say, Bob Dylan is the master songsmith of the last and probably this century, too. Great CD.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|suggested by a friend.  , Played it.  Was immediately hooked.  After playing a while, almost too easy, but wll keep
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This version of Emma is lovely. Jane Austen, as always, has made a beautiful story and the actors in this version<br />shine!
0765325950|5.0|Please, don't let the irrelevant reviews complaining about the lack of an e-book, and thereby falsely dragging down this excellent book's rating, fool you. If you have gotten this far in the series this is the right book, and you should not hesitate to buy, read, and enjoy it.<br />That said- not all of the plot lines were \\"tied off.\\" It's possible that you won't find any finality regarding your favorite character, or group- keep in mind that this is not necessarily a bad thing. I believe that this book ties off the series as well as could possibly be hoped, and that many of the plot lines which were left open were reasonably left that way.<br />This book is excellent. If you have read the others, buy it.
B005ZTFPFQ|3.0|It was kind of cool to play missile command as it was as I remember it.  However, it was lacking due to screen size.  Although this was downloaded to the large screen Samsung Galaxy S3, it still wasn't a large enough screen to allow a decent play.  The other surprising piece to this is that this is one of many Atari games that the install puts into the phone.  You can play only the one missile command game – have to pay for the rest.  It's what I would expect, however I didn't expect these hidden &#34;just click on me, pay and play&#34; shortcuts to be included with the one Atari game that I thought I was downloading.  It was a bit misleading.  Uninstalled it within minutes for both those reasons.
B00821OW8K|3.0|After reading the plot synopsis I was excited to watch the show, however was disappointed to find the writing was dumbed down beyond belief. Any effort to grab the viewers attention are immediately lost with the introduction of.. what appears to be.. a 9 year old heading a portion of the gun-toting resistance movement.    The show is so desperate for any demographic that they have one from each shoe horned into the show in a desperate bid for viewers. They got a kid to pander to children, they got a teen heart throb to pander to girls, they got a grizzled young father to pander to men who love action movies and their wives who let them watch it just because the lead is hot. The show doesn't know where to go with any of these characters so it meanders around stereotypical plots. The kids are written as selfish, the teens are written as impulsive, and the older characters a gamut of characters you've already seen in other shows.    The writing is dreadful and characters development seems to center around two actors yelling about an obvious wrong choice and an obvious right choice. There is not subtlety and nothing to get people to think about what they would do if cast in the same situation.    In Episode 1 for example, we are needlessly reminded through stilted dialogue that one of Tom's three sons are missing. He is referred to as \\"Ben.. BEN.. MY SON!!!\\" as if any father would need to clarify this in a group he's been with for months. So Tom and one of his sons Hal goes on a scouting trip to retrieve supplies. Hal splits up from the group as he's a scout. Hal is peering over some rocks and sees BEN. Hal reasonably ducks for cover as Ben is being mind controlled and flanked by about two alien gaurds who presumably wanted to take their slaves out for a walk. As is common of course, there is no need for cars or planes. They wanted to take a half an hour walk in the fresh air.    So Hal calmly heads back to the meeting area and proceeds to go bat-s*** insane about wanting to save Ben and it seems he's living in the heat of the moment AFTER it has already past. This is NOT how a hot head would have played out the scene. We then see Tom remind Hal that we ALL want to save BEN.. MY SON AND YOUR BROTHER! Thanks! I nearly forgot that a mere 15 minutes later. Tom and Hal argue and roll around on the floor a little bit to show character development (and to prove that Tom really DOES want to save Ben.. HIS SON!) but they can't because it's dangerous and BEN THE SON is surrounded by like 500 troops and 100 planes and maybe 250 more differenter planes or whatever.    You see, in a real life situation, if Hal was ACTUALLY as impulsive and driven as the script wants you to believe at this point he would have tried to save BEN right then and there because he already SAID he didn't care how many hostile aliens there were. Why on earth would he trot all the way back on an hour long motorcycle drive, meet up with everyone, then lose all his s***? Oh right.. you need drama, I nearly forgot.    Everyone talks in a raspy out of breath tone that sounds really cool but is in no way realistic or necessary for it. It only brings more attention that everyone is choosing to \\"act\\" in a way they think the audience wants. It's like everyone on the cast saw 24 featuring Jack Bauer and everyone is trying their best to do a Jack Bauer impression. It's distracting.    In Episode 2, a scout team looking for supplies believes a base isn't safe. So in order to see if a location is \\"safe\\" from Aliens they throw a ball for a dog to catch and act as bait. I don't know why they needed a dog to do it, but you know.. no one wants to see dogs get hurt so it's the device they use to elicit emotion from the viewer when normally there wouldn't be any. Now if you're going to use a dog as bait, you'd think you were prepared to use the dog as bait.. but no. The entire crew is surprised to see that there really WAS an alien there and the alien really wants to shoot the dog. So the kid (tell me again why there's a 9 year old on the team?) decides to run after the dog.. that he just released as BAIT moments ago because I guess that's what you do.. and nearly gets everyone killed. Cool.    None of this made sense and this is apparently something you'll have to put up with in order to watch the show.    In short.. plot is interesting but the writing is weak and the acting is middle of the road.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Great cast and script.  Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, Dev Patel and Tom Wilkinson all did excellent jobs in an odd, but well-conceived plot.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Must see TV!  You gotta love Walking Dead Season 3.  Lots of action, new characters, character development and walkers.  It makes me glad I'm not 'Walker Bait'.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Lots of levels.  No advertising.  Although most of the levels are fairly easy, there are a handful that will make you think.  Sort of addicting… Very easy.  I recommend it to anyone who is analytical.
B00846REIS|4.0|Seems like a complete spin off of 50 Shades. Too many similarities. Wasn't bad, just too familiar for me to enjoy.
B00571F26Y|5.0|My husband read the book and is absolutely against GMOs now.  He's lost 15 pounds effortlessly by eliminating grains from his diet.  If you want to be healthy now and in the future, this book is a must-read!
B003ZD9DUC|5.0|Excellent movie if You are a older men, and  You love the race cars. I had to have this movie for my collection. And the best, You can have the new format for the Price of the one.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Looks like solitaire, feels like solitaire, plays like solitaire; Microsoft Windows not required.  One cool feature… It provides a menu option to show you how to beat the game.  Surprisingly awesome.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Love stephen King!!! All of his books just keep getting better and the convenience of having it on the Kindle is great.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The cover is the tip of the iceburg - this is the story of the survival of spirit and human determination - I am overcome with every chapter - I recommend this book to anyone who needs a wake up call.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this game. The puzzles are challenging without being impossible, and the story has enough twists to be engrossing.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Not only is this game addicting, the background music is quite catchy.  Lots of action.  I was also pleasantly surprised during my first play by the unexpected but welcomed one armed bandit.  Great add-on!  If you like fun, silly, addicting games, this one is for you.  I'm 49 and like it very much.  A 70-year-old friend likes it just as much.  So I guess this is one is for any age.
B0055PMUSU|5.0|I throughly enjoyed it! AnnaSophia Robb does a great job portraying the heroic surfer! A must see if you haven't seen it yet.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|I have a lot of camera apps on my phone but no kind of editor until I got this one. Many features and easy to use.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This is such an orignial, funny, poignant show that keeps getting better.  I plan to purchase the other seasons as well, but got started with season one as a Christmas gift for a family member.  Well worth the price!
B009JBZH54|5.0|If you enjoy the movies this blu-ray set will be a great fit.  Three high quality HD movies and a making-of booklet which has some neat things in it.  Nice set if you dont own the movies already.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book... but I am not so sure about the ending. I wanted more.... catching fire was my favorite in the series, hands down!
B00A757EFW|5.0|Love it...takes me back to when I was a kid.  however could use a better joy stick but other than that I love it.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Love, love, love this movie!  Other than a few 'select' scenes, it is quite viewable by older teens and young adults as well. Cute, timeless stories and great acting.  I had purchased it years ago and the DVD broke so I bought it again on Amazon!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wonderful what next<br /><br />Final book has a lot to resolve hope it can end in greatness and not the that's it.......
B0090X4GLW|5.0|I chose a five star because this cd is sold out everywhere and it was shipped fast which let me get to listen to it sooner.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it! Didn't see so many things coming! Very interesting book, I can't wait for the movie. Onto the next one right NOW
1592537251|5.0|This is a great overview of the urban sketching movement and its key players from around the globe.<br /><br />If you are interested in sketching, drawing, architecture, urban design, art, or just seeing various environments from around the globe check it out.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Eventhough I'm not much of a horror fan, 28 Days Later is one of my favorite films.  Walking Dead takes cues from the Danny Boyle disaster film in that it's more of a morality tale with incredible special FX.  The makeup artists better sweep TV awards.  The writers know just when to make the twists.  As soon as the rick, Shaine and Lori storyline got redundant they took a turn.  This season is off to a brilliant start with the introduction of new characters.  This show is so much more than a Zombie movie.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I don't understand why people are raving about how hot this book is. The only thing that made me all hot and bothered while reading it was that I was leaning against my radiator.
B001PUBLF2|5.0|How did the rest of America miss this one?  Maybe I'm just getting older but this is a fantastic album.  Unplugged covers of Pink Floyd, Led Zepplin, UFO, etc.  WOW!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|This is my first book by Lee Child that wasn't a collection of short stories. I have heard good things about his Jack Reacher series but have never picked one up. I can honestly say I enjoyed this. It was a little slow at times but I liked the characters. I kept wondering if Jack would stay in town and give up his wandering lifestyle. I was looking forward to what happened next not just because it progressed the story, but because it developed the characters more and I enjoyed that.<br /><br />I won't say this is one of my favorites but it did peak my interest enough that I will defiantly give the next book in the series a chance. Whether I stay with this series or not I can't say but the story was well written. I wish the pace was a little faster at times but overall a good book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season brings new characters and nonstop suspense.  As a viewer you want the characters to be able to relax and just have one calm safe day - no such thing in the new world as the adventure brings so many twists and turns it's all you can do to hold on until the next episode.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I read the series to see what all the hype was about. And while the 3rd one was the best of the 3, it was still pretty bad. As for the &#34;insane kinky scenes&#34; it kind of just goes to show you how sheltered and boring the sex loves of housewives are.
B006UG90RM|3.0|OK I'm a die hard VH fan for both Dave and Sammy alike.  This one was simply newly recorded old material that sounds more like a garage band than evolved VH.  Still hard and heavy, I guess I expected more artistic refinement.  I'm on the fence with this one.
B000I8ES70|5.0|Great movie, just needed this one to complete the full line up! Watch this series of movies in order to get the most out of it,
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great for sleepless nights and for killing time when bored.  Very addicting, pleasingly fun, and relaxing at the same time.
B000056HE9|5.0|They don't make them like this anymore - They try but they just don't want to I guess. I love these old movies.
0316789798|5.0|My 12 year old niece is just developing her talent, and this was a great book to help her understand the basics.  Fun animals too
B007HACDLK|5.0|Couldn't stop reading. Non-stop action. Flynn just keeps getting better. USA needs more Mitches. When does the next Flynn book come out?
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely loved it! The characters are so real and you easily fall into the story. I was unable to put it down. The only criticism I can give if pressed would be that after the first flash back the plot was easy enough to figure out. But even though I kinda knew how things would turn out I still couldn't stop reading and absolutely fell in love with the characters.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|They don't make them like this anymore - they should - They would be shocked at the responses. Good job.
B000WCDBKM|5.0|This one is one of those &#34;who ever heard of this movies&#34;...its GREAT !!! One of those rare movies that you can watch more than once and see something new each time
B009O2XY12|5.0|this game is a fun game for you to play. it keeps them busy if need be. good for all ages.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|Newbury comics had a Batman movie i didnt even know was made and i got it today an bluray and i cant wait to see it! It came in great shape and goes great with the reat of my Batman collection! They did a great delivery service and would order from them again thanks Newbury!

B007W8S2MG|5.0|If you have any interest in JRPGs or RPGs in general you can't go wrong with this title. It is a party based RPG and has a bit of a collection game built in with finding/creating additional Persona's (avatars you could say) that have different skills etc.<br /><br />You also have a mini social simulator included in the form of the main character interacting with group members. Spending time with them increases their power and bonuses. There are tons of things going on in this game and I highly recommend it!
B0064T6LV8|4.0|this game is a fun game for you to play. it keeps them busy if need be. good for all ages.
B000002IQ9|5.0|Obviously one of the greatest voices in the world! Whether he is alone or with Genesis hes a musical genious! Masterdvd got a great concert to i used to have it and i lost it and now i got it back! They did a great delivery job and would order from them again cant wait to hear the concert!!! Thanks!
B001F6TXME|5.0|I bought this product for my Nikon D5100 and it works even better than I had anticipated. Push the button down half-way or fully and it works just like the shutter release button on the camera. Or you can lock it down for long exposures. It's the perfect companion to using Live View on a tripod-mounted camera, such as for portraits or macro work. I wish the cord were a little longer but it's not a major issue. Quality seems very good. Highly recommended.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|It was excellent. Great dvd if you like Leonard Cohen. Well produced. He put on a wonderful show that people of all ages would enjoy.
B0015DROBO|1.0|Unfortunately, I found this book to be a slow, boring read, and I abandoned it, opting out for the movie version. The author's style of writing did not appeal to me. Too much detail, which  some how interrupted the flow of the plot/theme of the novel.<br /><br />I was advised that it would get better and more enjoyable after a few chapters, but I could barely get though chapter 1.
B001NN4162|5.0|Our 12 y/o daughter desperately wanted this movie for Christmas.  (The VHS version that we have had doesn't work so well in a blu-ray player.) She has watched it several times, and still loves it.  It's an oldie but a goodie!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|To be fair, this is the type of movie I really enjoy.  Odd-ball characters, laughs and a little romance.  The singing numbers are a logical part of the story and not just thrown in at random moments.  You gotta love Fat Amy.<br />I watch movies to be entertained and this was just that; very entertaining!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Enjoy playing this version of spider solitary ! It's very good in quality. I like that you can play it anytime anywhere ! It's nice that it's timed so that you can try to beat your old time. Would definitely recommend it to someone else.
0756666937|5.0|The kids loved this, and I even like reading through it too. Great ideas for building and we have learned a lot more reading through this together.
B0011N1WE8|5.0|Penelope  was a Christmas gift and she requested it by title. She knew she would love it. She Did. Thanks!
0765334798|5.0|I am a fan of John Scalzi and have enjoyed his writing immensely, especially the Old Man's War stories and Agent to the Stars.  But this book, surpasses the others, especially if you're a Trekkie.  John is an engaging author that draws you into his stories to the point that you think you're one of the characters.  Alas, my review writing is not nearly as prolific, proficient or amusing.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this book, and I don't see how you could not, then read this one: http://www.amazon.com/The-Martian-Novel-Andy-Weir/dp/0804139024
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have not felt this way about a TV series in a long time.I can hardly wait for the next episode. I love that it is so easy to watch anytime on Amazon Prime. I can`t stop telling people about it.
1419705849|5.0|I did not read this book myself, but my kids love this series - and they love this one too!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Amazing and the best book I have read well not the whole thing thank u for the best book ever
B00APUYWYA|4.0|There is some good humor and music in this movie.  It was prefect for the not serious Sunday night movie
B005K17RU0|5.0|I enjoy being able to plan ahead for my day and with WI weather; it can change in a second.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Even better than the movie as the story was somewhat different.  Very spiritual, totally entertaining and very, very graphic.  A great read.
B008OOYALE|2.0|This game is quite a bit of fun but there both pros and cons to this game.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />This game has a big variety of cute and cool dragons.<br />It's fun to hatches strange dragons and to leverage up into epic form.<br />There is a nice level up system based on doing quests for rewards.<br />You can visit and give a daily present of gold(equivalent to gems in other games)<br />You can visit other breeders islands to improve you social standings.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />Forme this ruined the entire game by making hard to play unless you paid real money.<br /><br />The reason you would have to spend money is that all of the quests have tiny coin rewards. For example there are quests that tell you to buy, say,  5 trees each cost 800(not sure what the actual price is) each. Once that's all said and done the reward would be like 1000 xp and 500 coins. This is a game were you can't afford to be poor in because like in most games, the higher levels you are the new expensive everything is. You will end up waiting for days to gather up enough coins to actually make progress.<br /><br />If you still want a game like this I recommend DragonVale. This game is the same as this game but the rewards are actually big enough to support you. But the dragons aren't as cute in my opinion.
B005TBWN0K|5.0|I downloaded this app to use with Evernote and be able to make notes by writing instead of typing. Seem to work like it is supposed to.
B001DRF84W|1.0|received HD DVD which I could not play on my machine.  I had to open it to see if the invoice/packing slip which read Blu-ray was correct or the case that said HD DVD was correct.  I can't return opened DVDs.
B008I34YYY|5.0|THE CAMP STYLE AND THE PARITIES KEEP IT GOING. I COULDN'T HELP BUT BUY A COPY TO WATCH AGAIN. GREAT FUN
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome! I really think you should make a mod app for this. The mod app is supposed to add mods into the game! I think you should try it!
B007TKBD4G|5.0|I ordered this Vinyl Record for my girlfriend as she loves both records and Edward Sharpe. The product arrived in great condition and plays well. Favorite songs on this record are &#34;Man on Fire,&#34; &#34;That's What's Up,&#34; and &#34;Child.&#34; Girlfriend was very satisfied with this record and so was I.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Reads like a suspenseful novel even though you know the ending. How he managed to accomplish what he did from where he started, is just incredible. A great read!

0765325950|5.0|I was not disappointed.  It was difficult to see it all end but worth it.  I didn't want to put the book down, but I didn't want it to end either.  Kudos to Brandon Sanderson for finishing this admirably.  I wish Robert Jordan could still be around for more books set in this world.
B000031WD9|5.0|This is just a great movie.  It was in great condition as well, and I'd recommend it to anyone who has a sense of humor.
141659521X|5.0|ANOTHER GREAT ADVENTURE WITH MITCH RAPP. FAST READ FOR FLYNN FANS. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE. I WISH I COULD TELL WHICH ONES I HAVEN'T READ.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Book was AWESOME! I am usually one to take my time reading a book but for this one I kept reading and finished it in 2 nights. It is very catchy and keeps the reader interested. I definitely recommend this book!
B000N4SHPS|5.0|This DVD was in great condition when I received it, and it still plays well.  The entire Rocky Series should be watched by one and all!
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I don't hear enough of Garth on the radio anymore, so this really gives me my Garth fix for a day.  Lovely selection.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|definitely not for kids. sort of racist at parts, but very funny overall. the hotel fight scene was my favorite part of the movie.
B008M721MS|1.0|Do not expect Skype to protect you if the app does not work properly. Take care to pay for Skype services with an active credit card that handles disputes professionally. DO NOT use PayPal or bank account debits.<br /><br />Last March, I downloaded an app release by Skype for my Windows Phone. It did not work. Skype initially denied the existence of such an app. Finally, it acknowledged that it did not work properly.<br /><br />PayPal said my payment covered a service and not refundable. Skype ignored repeated request using email (no phone for a telephony provider?)<br /><br />Just today, pursuing use for my Kindle Fire, I found that my initial deposit was forfeit for inactivity. I used chat to request reinstatement. The representative seemed unable to extract information despite a \\"Dick & Jane\\" narrative, asking off-base questions and even, well into the conversation, requesting my screen name -- provided on the transcript. It became apparent that, if not illiterate, the representative was trained to deflect callers and outlast any caller's attempt at redress.
B00A80SHFM|4.0|This soundtrack is great, if you love the movie. Since the recordings were done live on set during filming, the soundtrack is directly from that (you can hear movement/rain in some tracks - it's not disrupting though).<br />Only give it 4 stars because some key songs are missing. I realize it's only highlights, but some songs seem like they should still be there (ex: Do you Hear the people sing).<br />Great to listen to though!
B008C20TDG|5.0|I purchased this on my kindle first and read it overnight. I decided to try the Whole30 program over the holidays and was surprised how easy it was for me. I told my family about it over Christmas and we decided to start the program on Jan 2, 2013, we are all feeling better and losing weight, we are now on day 14. After telling all of my friends about this amazing way to eat, I decided to order 3 more hard copies to share.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I read somewhere that this was a really good movie, and it looked interesting.  I was disappointed.  My husband watched it with me, and at the end, we both felt the same way.  It was, at best, an okay movie.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This is a fantastic film! It is quirky and original and dare I say &#34;cute.&#34; It has definitely earned its nominations for all the award shows. Amazing writing.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|The book is a real eye opener.  I was amazed and quite shocked to learn that Steve had such a &#34;colorful and strange background.  It really was interesting to follow the development of all the amazing products that Apple produced over the years. I am not a technical person, but, as I write this review on my IPad, I am blown away at how far we have come in the technology world.  What else will be coming in the next few years?
B0095EMOTM|4.0|Solid CD, lots of decent tracks!  Has its share of good and bad tracks, but enough to make this a worthwhile purchase for sure.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I LOVE Nicholas Sparks! I was so excited to see that he had a new book, and a movie to follow!!! I read this in just under 2 days, I couldn't put it down! I love the small twist at the end.. And it isn't like his other books. I cant wait to see the movie, but i LOVE LOVE LOVE this book!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Words are inadequate to explain how I feel about this book. It is well-written - easy to understand and follow- even the technical and scientific information and jargon were explained well.  More importantly, though, is the story of Dr. Alexander's experience. As a Christian I have no doubts that what he experienced is true - that he experienced a non-earthly realm. My faith is encouraged and enlarged.
B007M45PMU|5.0|This self titled album is a fantastic entry for the band. It has a great acoustic sound and just a mellow attitude. The single \\"Ho Hey\\" will sit with you pleasantly for some time. This album makes great to listen to while relaxing or sitting outside.
B001HC8516|5.0|Ok, I have read this book multiple times... But its a classic in my eyes! I Love having it on my kindle, and will read it again and again. Definitely things I wouldn't think of, and in a mans view... Enlightening? :)
B00445YMME|5.0|Easy watching great humor, best sitcom I've seen. Acting is brilliant and writing is better. Highly recommended; season 2 is actually better than season 1.
B0053TMP24|5.0|The best book ever great detail and Percy Jackson fans will love. New characters and the proficy of 7 comes too life.make sure you read this book
B005AC65TS|5.0|This is a fantastic album.  I have this in constant rotation.  Driving home from a bad day at work (which is often) this the album (do we still call them albums?) that I go to.  Driving home, plug my ipod in and Hiatt is taking me home.
034580404X|4.0|I read this after everyone I knew kept talking about it.  DIdnt want to be out of the loop.  It was good read all three book an about a week.  What more can I say, If you like smut you will like this series.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I watched Season One of Downton Abbey on Saturday on Netflix at the recommendations of my daughter.  By the last episode, I found myself desperately waiting to see what happened next.  I was so happy to find Season Two of Downton Abbey on Amazon and quickly added it to my video collection.  The time period is perfectly displayed, the actors are top notch and actually fit their roles perfectly.  You can't help falling in love with the characters as you watch their day to day life in Downton.  I did not think I would like the series, but it is one of my favorites now.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This is a good game and I will recommend this to anyone. I enjoyed it and would buy more games from this company.
B0050SYS5A|3.0|It works okay, I'm glad we purchased it but we still need more room in our living room. I didn't realize how much space you needed I could have bought our xbox for cheaper if I didn't buy this one but i wanted the kinect now wish I didn't.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed all three of the Fifty Shades books, didn't want to put them down and then was bummed I had finished.
0865479410|5.0|Having read many books about how to use positive thinking and attended lectures and seminars etc. over a number of years I found this book to be refreshing and in tune with real life.  A positive outlook can work to a point in many situations but can become a stumbling block to real growth in the form of denial which this book illustrates very well.
B0000524E5|5.0|I love this movie, we had it on VHS and then our VHS player died so had to replace it with this. Works great.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Totally interesting.  Hated to put it down once I started reading.  Never read this or Huck Finn growing up but thoroughly enjoyed the book.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|My grandsons (5,8) learned not only about their Scottish heritage  (we are  also MacDonalds) from this film but got a lesson in how smart women think and behave, and were not bored as males usually are when stories center around women.  They were engrossed and happy to view the movie several times and will surely watch it again.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I hope Yahoo makes a come back. In my opinion, for the normal home user, I prefer it over google mail.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I watch this all the time.  Love it on my Kindle as I can check Hawaii and Florida!  Great app!
B00A9X9VAI|5.0|This is a fantastically imagined, written, and acted movie. Every scene has worth to the picture as a whole and every actor (even the 6year old) are completely believable in the way they are portrayed. The plot alone is a very interesting arc of present and future selves *spoiler Bruce Willis isn’t JGL’s dad* attempting to make the future they desire.<br /><br />It is so hard to find good Sci Fi lately. But this movie gets it right. Looper never tries to go over the top with its Sci Fi elements, or never makes you feel like they are making it up as they go. Personally, I feel like some movies can do that from time to time in this genre.<br /><br />Very enjoyable experience, and isn’t that what a movie should be?
B0030M3SBI|5.0|Hendrix. Classic. A must have for any fan. Crank it when driving and enjoy one of this countries true rock legends.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Very fun and very relaxing! The more you play the better you get and beware it is very addicting! Thanks!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|this book had popped up in my \\"things you might be interested in\\" area for a few weeks, and i finally decided to give it a shot, i mean hell, only 99 cents<br />single best dollar i have spent in my whole life. honestly. even better than that bag of skittles that was mostly all red ones.<br />the story is very interesting and incredibly well written. many authors attempt humor, most of them miss the mark. this book had me laughing so many times i lost count. there is one part with an emoticon....tears coming down my face laughing so hard!<br />some other commenters have complained that the man on mars didn't seem to take things seriously, and this is explained in the book, but its also common sense. some people, especially people that are highly trained and intelligent, don't freak the heck out in every situation.<br />also, full disclosure, i'm a botanist, so, yeah......all that stuff is accurate!<br />curious why the book is so cheap. this is easily a 4 or 5 dollar e-book.<br />Again, i recommend this book to everybody because it's crazy awesome.
0385536828|3.0|As the conventional wisdom goes, when writers are out of ideas, they write stories about writers. But what about a story about a reader? That's fairly fresh, isn't it? Ian McEwan's new novel Sweet Tooth is, indeed, about a reader -- one who happens to work for the British Security Service (MI5).<br /><br />It's the early '70s, and the Cold War is in full weary swing. MI5 concocts a scheme to \\"sponsor\\" writers they think will write novels that illustrate the futility of communism -- an operation codenamed Sweet Tooth. It's a tried-and-true method in the \\"war of ideas,\\" as they've learned from their intelligence counterparts across the pond. Serena Frome, early 20s, gorgeous, lover of books, and new to the service, is tasked with \\"running\\" a promising writer named Tom Haley. Her mission is simply to convince him to accept money from a front literary Foundation, and then keep tabs on his progress as a short story writer, journalist, and (it's hoped) novelist.<br /><br />One problem: She immediately falls in love with him. Even bigger problem: Her immediate supervisor Max at MI5 may be in love with her. So how will Serena keep the secret of who she actually works for from Tom, maintain her relationship with him (because, you know, they are genuinely in love!), and keep Max at bay?<br /><br />If all that sounds very intriguing, it is! And the intrigue is heightened by the fact that McEwan writes in the first person (i.e., Serena is telling us her story) -- a bold choice, to be sure. But the issue here is that it takes more than half the novel just to get to that point. Meanwhile, McEwan gives us a ton of background on Serena's childhood and time studying \\"maths\\" at Cambridge. Then, we detour into the story of a professor at Cambridge named Tony, with whom she Serena has an affair (he's married...scandalous!). And then, as she begins research to lure Tom into Sweet Tooth, we get several long summaries of Tom's short stories. And finally, British politics find their way in here and there, infusing the very slowly building story with a bit more dull. Yes, all this is relevant to what McEwan eventually has in store for us -- but that doesn't mean any of it is incredibly interesting.<br /><br />Contrary to what you may have heard, this is not a spy novel, nor is it a \\"Cold War thriller\\" as a blurb on the back suggests. It's much more of a slow-burn than a white-knuckler -- a story about a reader's relationship with a writer she first admires, then loves...with a bunch of Cold War stuff thrown in to dress up that kernel of plot. McEwan pulls you along just fast enough that you're not willing to give up before something important happens.<br /><br />Sweet Tooth ties with Solar as my least favorite McEwan novel. (I loved both Atonement and Saturday.) But McEwan diehards may enjoy Sweet Tooth much more than I did -- his dry wit and sharply observed descriptions are definitely on display here. And, as always, he's got something up his sleeve. But to me, that wasn't enough to save this one.here and there, infusing the very slowly building story with a bit more dull.

B005LAIHZE|5.0|I love the book, and I love the movie. The movie is a bit different from the book, I think it's a good thing. Why re-read the book if the movie tells the same exact story, only much quicker? They're both good in their own ways.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|What can one say - John Grisham is one of the best authors of our time.  Continues to write with such skill and keeps us waiting for the next book to come out.  Truly a talent.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is truly a well-written  book; good characters, excellent dialog, redemption and grace.  The Holder character was exceptional, reason to hope, perhaps? lol.  Even though the characters were young, the author did a very good job of telling the story and did not allow for judgement based on the age of the characters and took the reader on a great ride.  Well done.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|This item arrived very quickly. The item arrived exactly as I expected. Thank you very much for the timely fulfillment.
B004SEUIXS|5.0|This is a very  nice movie, i would recommend this to all my friends and family. And it was a very good price as well.

B003UYUP6M|5.0|This item arrived very quickly. The item arrived exactly as I expected. Thank you very much for the timely fulfillment.
B005NQ5LSC|5.0|This movie is really good, you are able to see how Ip Man became who he is and his upbringing.  I recommend this movie to any one that likes martial art.  This is the movie to see.
141659521X|3.0|Although I have read all of the Mitch Rapp series, this novel left me cold and, unlike his prior novels, I was hesitant to turn the page anticipating the slow development of this story.<br />I'll continue to read his future novels with the hope that they will be better than his last.

B000MQ54OY|5.0|Such a good movie. Great music. Makes you happy just to watch it....and then you want to get up and dance!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|-it's simply too fascinating and well written.  I expected it to be dry and full of psychological factoids, but it has proved to be an<br />engaging read.
B0037FFBCW|2.0|I had just opened the shrink wrap and popped it straight into my DVD player and it skipped at a few crucial scenes. It really bugged me because it happened when we first were introduced to John, the elephant man, and right before he passed away. I'm about to send an email to the seller and complain because I don't think that it's right that I was sold a damaged product.<br /><br />Movie is phenomenal though. David Lynch is a beast behind the camera.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|Not your usual holiday movie.......that's what makes it so good. Great actors in it. Great storylines.  Sad and happy. Just like the holidays.
B005COO1X6|2.0|Very short story.... imaginative but lacking in specifics and substance. Not worthy of a charge. Rather disappointing :( save your money.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|This is the first I read like this, I enjoyed it f r on beginning t o end! I felt sorry for Cathy and her OCD and I wanted her to be able to live life like she use to. I was happy when she met Stuart.
0525478817|5.0|I purchased this book for my teenage daughter and she can't put it down. She absolutely loves it! Great book for teens.
B0007VNCQ6|5.0|The game is well-made and fun for 5 to adult to play.  It arrived in a earlier than expected.  So there were no worries about whether I could get it wrapped in time for Christmas.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|I have given this to all my siblings and my children.  I love PG Wodehouses stores, except the Jeeves and Wooster stories.  In my opinion, this is far and away the best way to experience these clever stories.

1439152780|5.0|A nice escape....I picked this up when I was sick and really couldn't get out of bed...was the closest thing on my nightstand.  But it was an excellent choice.  I loved the book.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|What an addicting game.  Got my husband hooked on it as well.  I played it so many times in a row before bedtime one night that my brain was finding pathways for 2 - 3 hours before I could fall asleep.  Had to lay off the game for a couple of days.
0345529057|5.0|The box set collection was worth every penny! It came in a new and very good condition! It is a great gift for lovers of Game of Thrones! My partner has the first and second season DVDs and this was a great add to his collection! He loves it!

0307279189|5.0|I read BORN TO RUN last May while taking a hiatus from running marathons (and life in general) while on vacation.  Never would I have imagined the impact Christopher McDougall's story would have on me as a runner and the life I once led.  Growing up `poor' in the Midwest, we, as children, always ran barefoot during the summers.  We never gave it a second thought and, even today, fifty years later, the arches remain strong.<br /><br />But then in 2002, I turned to running marathons and fell for the hype of `corrective' running shoes.  Not knowing any better, I took it for granted that a long-distance runner would experience glitches during the training program and the marathon.  I brushed it off as simply part of the pain of long-distance running.<br /><br />After reading BORN TO RUN, I made the conscious decision to pull a pair of weather-beaten running shoes out of the closet and put everything on the line.  The shoes already had 300 plus miles on them.  By the time I completed my quest of training and running back-to-back marathons (Chico - November; CIM - December) I would clock over 700 miles on one set of shoes.<br /><br />I expected the worst - my arches would cave, knots would form, and every possible conceivable injury a runner could incur would stop me dead in my tracks.<br /><br />It didn't happen.<br /><br />For the first time in my life I ran back-to-back marathons AND incurred no glitches whatsoever.<br /><br />We are all born to run.  We do it as kids.  Some of us-me included- just forgot how.  Thanks Chris for reminding us with your intriguing story.<br /><br />Footnote:  I liked the book so much I had to have it in hardcover after reading it digitally.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|IT IS VERY COOL  IT SHOULD GO ALL AROUND THE World I love your book this is better then the first
B007QPFGJW|2.0|Nesbo has been billed by some as being similar to Stieg Larsson. Phantom is the third book of the Harry Hole series that I've read and, including Phantom, I've been disappointed twice (liked The Snowman, didn't like The Leopard).<br /><br />The beginning of the book is completely confusing and I almost put it down after 50 pages. Nesbo starts each thread of the story without using any character names and includes the perspective of a rat at the murder scene, which totally lost me. Gusto's (the murder victim) \\"dying thoughts\\" is one of these threads, which actually does add to the story later in the book, but these segments are a mess in the beginning.<br /><br />I thought things got better through the middle, but slid downhill again as Nesbo explained and then discarded most of the potential solutions to the mystery. There were so many twists (not in a good way), I found myself forgetting whether a certain character had been eliminated from suspicion for Gusto's murder. And, the nail in Phantom`s coffin is that I absolutely despised the ending. Though I love Harry Hole as a character, I think I'm done with Nesbo's books for awhile.<br /><br />For more reviews, check out my blog, Sarah's Book Shelves.
B003GXJ072|5.0|'Alien&#34; is one of my favorite films.  Although I do like the entire series of 'Alien' movies, this is my favorite.  The film itself is well directed and includes an awesome cast.  Sigourney Weaver is one of the best actresses ever, in my opinion, and the other members of the cast are simply spot on.  The story line isn't mucked up with irrelevant material, but instead, is very clean, clear and engaging.  It seems that every screen writer believes they must throw nudity, sexually explicit material and the excessive use of foul language into a film to get an audience.  Not in this one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book made me laugh, cry ,and feel in love. Katniss and peeta are amazing characters and I can't wait to read the next one
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I REALLY LIKE THIS APP FOR THE SIMPLE. REASON IM AKWAYS FORGETTING TO _POWER UP. WITH THIS APP THAT IS NO LONGER A PROBLEM<br />.  THANK.  YOU. ROBBIEKLJE
0783116934|5.0|This movie is rare.  I have seen hundreds of investigative/detective shows and movies.  Nothing has come close to this.  Not only does the film examine why a serial killer may do what they do, but more importantly, it follows a detective through years of psychological turmoil and the frustration he experiences desperately seeking a child killer that the Soviet Union refuses to admit even exists, even after dozens of bodies are found.  Stephen Rhea:  I never saw this guy before this movie, and I watch everything I see him now.  His performance is incredible as the detective.  Regardless if you like investigative films, Citizen X is non-stop, factual and gives us a very realistic idea of what happens when men believe they have to kill and the men that won't stop until they find them.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is honestly a great book. I feel as though the high school English teachers should put this one in the curriculum. Even though To Catch A Rye was mentioned in this book,  I really think it was better and stirring an essay after reading it wouldn't be difficult if read thoroughly.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I didn't expect to like this series that everyone is talking about. What a pleasant surprise--I am hooked. It has become my evening escape.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Gave this to my 11yr old daughter for Christmas. Both her and I enjoyed it. It is very sad that Bethany loses her arm, but overall the movie is very positive and inspiring. I was worried the shark attack might be scary and gruesome, for you children, but it was very well done.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|An incredible book that is hard to put down despite its overall length. An amazingly complex and intricate storyline that weaves in and out of the main characters. A Machiavellian masterpiece.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|It is so funny to see the old special effects, we laugh more then I think the wroiters intended.  Very entertaining though!
B00AHXIC50|4.0|This is an excellent album and Bruno Mars is touching what was and is great about music.  I highly recommend this album.
B000O78KW4|5.0|Love both Bruce and Samuel and they are great together! This is part of a great trilogy! I recommend it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have not read a book in months and found this to be a very easy to get into and enjoyed the story line .
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Best book in the world so suspenceful I hope she goes out with Gale I <3 that movie and Book
B0018Q4BTQ|5.0|As normal, Brad cranks out happy American patriotic funny tunes. I wish I could just begin to play the guitar like him. Not a bad song on the album. Its an oldie but goodie:-)
B002NZTZ8S|4.0|My kids loved this movie, definitely great movie for children to watch. I  give it two thumbs up, good job
B009E3EY38|5.0|It is so good to see them on stage all together again and sounding soooo good.<br />WOw, I couldn't believe it, the sound was huge, Jimmy Page's guitar tone was raw and heavy. Plant did a great job with all the songs. John Paul Jones sounding as good as ever, and Jason was superb filling in for his dad.<br /><br />The Blu-ray sounded awesome, although the camera work did get a bit annoying at times.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />Thank you Page, Plant, Jones, and Jason !
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A glorious giant of a book. Right up there with To Kill A Mockingbird as my favorite book! The author has given the world a treasure.
B006JD48NM|5.0|Purchased the SENNA DVD for our son who is an avid Formula 1 race fan and he really did love it!!!  The story, history of early Formula 1 racing to quote him was memorizing and needed<br />to be seen more then once.  Actually, earlier in 2012 the undersigned view this documentary on television and found it not only an excellent fascinating DVD but a keeper for all fans of<br />Formula 1 and racing.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Bob and Gay Ann
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I wrote a review for this book one time before and I have to admit - I didn't gave it justice.<br /><br />I tried honestly to read this book two times. And only after the reccomentation of my friend - she was totally in love with this book - I went after the first third part of the book and then I realised that it WAS actually a very exciting book! It begins like typical teen-romance with a lot of idiotical dialogs and empty spent pages. Yeah, I hope, the writer will makesome progress on her writing in the future and will take the rule \\"minimum words - maxium meaning\\" as her literary motto (therefore only 4 stars, not five!).<br /><br />But The plot! It's something! After the smooches and that kind of stuff in the beginning it became a real thriller. It was maybe even a liitle too much for an young adult, but the book with its intimate, even sex containing scenes, I think, is for quite grown-up young adults.<br /><br />It was heart-tearing read. Thank you, Colleen Hoover!
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I like this game. It's fun and there are plenty of levels to keep you busy for a long time. The secret to scoring the most points is to try to destroy everything, not just the piggies!<br />The graphics are not as good as in other games I've played. I guess that's why it's also offered in HD. It's nice to not have the ads taking up space, though.<br />All in all, it's a good game. I am definitely getting my 99 cents out of it!
B000002AGY|5.0|I first hear dthis in the mid 70's and loved it then. I had it on vinyl. I also purchased a cassete.<br />Looked for it for years as a cd......and then I found it! I bought (4) and shipped 3 to friends and family!<br />Yes, I really like this recording!<br />Jim Tapscott
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|What a great, great book!!  Captivated from the first paragraph to the last one.  The only frustrating thing were of course the Afghanistan vocabulary - Kindle's dictionary is limited :) but that doesn't detract from the book.
B006O6F932|3.0|The structual is not sturdy at all. If you move the school, the wall will come unattached. And the spider webs will not stay in the slot.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|this game is so much fun. I play it all day everyday. so I rate it five stars. I love it.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Great series. Each book was great on its own, but Son really tied it together. I would recommend it to adults & young adults
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book reminds me very much of the twilight saga...but only in the beginning.the plot was okay.the book slowly gets better especially the ending.it shows how strong of a woman Ana is.it reveals the truth behind relationships..minus Christians exotic and kinky tastes in hurting women.it speaks volume about incompatibility and I love it.it wasn't something I expected.as I was reading the last few pages, I found myself feeling sympathy for Ana and what she is going through.the heart break written in the ending is raw and makes me wanting more.I can't wait to read the next book.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|The little flap where the charger goes broke within 3 weeks. It also made things sound funny, and it was hard for others to hear me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was a really well written book. It had confusing twists and turns and you always wanted to read more. At some points literally I couldn't put the book down. I cant wait until I read Mockingjay.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I got this for my husband who is a huge fan.  He really enjoyed them and watched them as much as possible.  I liked the packaging.  A lot of our friends are fans as well, and the packaging makes it easy to transport them for a movie marathon.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I personally loved all the action and adventurer.<br />I loved this book and you will too so read it!!!!!!!<br />:)
B000ATQYT2|5.0|We ordered this for a Christmas Movie Marathon at our house.  It was a great movie and a wonderful classic.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Very engrossing, not terribly original but it's a good story and helps if you're into the show which I am...
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I liked this movie but was not expecting such language.  There is one storyline that follows to people who are making a porno flick.  It works with the story and does add too it.  But it just took me by surprise.
B00A25NLOU|3.0|Loved the respect for print and preserving knowledge but the industry jargon sometimes gets in the way of the story.
B004LWZW9C|5.0|I always loved the movies that had different stories that intertwine.  It was a pretty clean movie too (we bought it to have a movie marathon for some of our church friends).
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I could not put the book down as I had no idea what the characters were trying to accomplish, or why. It was very different for John Grisham, but thouroughly enjoyable.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|I wish that there was a stick I could use that had magic and be able to instill lessons in our children. I love this story
0307352145|4.0|This book has lots of information regarding the world of introverts.  Some is scientific and some is social, just an interesting read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If you like a good romance then I recommend this book. It keeps you guessing and you don't know what will happen next. Once you start you will not want to set this book down. A definite must read!
B009NPKTN6|5.0|Tom Cruise does a TREMENDOUS job in this movie.  His persona was an excellent representation of a true rock star.<br />His singing skills were so amazing, that he ought to be a recording artist as well as an actor. Alec Baldwin & Russell Brand were hilarious and unbelievably talented. Really enjoyed everything about it.
B0052SF6CM|5.0|Ive been listening to Calvin for almost 10 yrs, very different from his first album.  Every album of his gets more dance/mainstream.  I could leave a few tracks that are on the radio, but overall pretty good album.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The Masterpiece classic Downton Abbey was a very good version of the classic Hugh Bonneville book. I would recommend it to anyone who loves the era.

B007VUA7VO|3.0|Seems to like to take over when I plug it in... and has seemed to slow things down a bit...

B0091LS07E|3.0|There is no doubt Alicia has a great voice but, I just wasn't in love with this CD.  It just was a little over the top for me. I like her previous CD's a lot more.  She seemed to strain on several of the songs and just over did it. It is still a good CD, just not in love with it.
B005DN7W4G|5.0|This is just a great movie, i've seen it several times and enjoy watching it every time so it just made sense to buy it :)
B009G7ZYPY|3.0|She has a sweet and unique voice.  Anything she sings is great.  I would prefered to hear the full orchestra behind her.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Lately i've been obsessed with this movie and so I ordered it online and i've gotta say, I love it, I totally recommend it if you like movies with singing and dancing in it :)
B009A9BEHU|5.0|great! Would it be anything else! Cold play would never let you down. What a great band. I love them.
B003YUF0GC|5.0|worked out of box no issues works with ubuntu and windows- arrived on time and well packaged - would recommend to anyone interested in usb-gps.
1435114949|5.0|This book is a  pleasure, it is beautifully bound. The introduction has fascinating information, most of which was new to me.<br />I am glad to have the complete collection and I am sure I will be enjoying this book for a long time.Anyone who enjoys books will love this. Of course the stories are so famous they don't need a recommendation!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the entire book in a day! Can't wait to read the others now! Oh, and watch the movie.
B00129H7VS|5.0|&#34;Band of Brothers&#34; is timeless in it's story and production value. I already owned the standard DVD version, but had to get the Blu-Ray edition for the additional visual details and for the extra content in this version.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I was babysitting and one like lps so I got this app and she loves it. Every time I go over she wants to
B0015AARJI|5.0|I bought this to use with my Nexus 7. It is well made and works great. It is a little particular on charging voltage and wouldn't charge off my Nexus 7 or my USB hub. I had to charge it on my computer. From my Internet research this is normal.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest, so this app was perfect for me.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like was that you can not just repin something from the search page.  You have to actually click on it and then click repin.  It's weird that way.  Or maybe it's only like that on my Kindle.  But it still does all the functions you want it to do like creating new boards and posting messages.
0061537969|5.0|It is a very rare book that brings one to both tears of great emotional pain and belly laughter at exactly the same time!  This is one of those rare books.  Once I read the first page I had to read it all in one sitting; quite rare for me!  Enzo shares with us his extraordinary insight and unconditional love while narrating the story of his life with his dearest friend, Denny, Denny,s wife Eve, and their daughter Zoë.  I learned so much about life, love,  and having absolute faith in ones ability to be true to yourself and your dreams.  I will remember one quote in particular because, even at my age of 65, it says all I need to know...\\"That which you manifest is before you.\\"
B004SEUIXS|2.0|But I think this was a copy of a DVD.  I'm probably 90% sure.  It looks like a fairly well made copy, but still, it's a copy.  And I'm pretty sure that's illegal.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love this game! I lived playing with real cards growing up. Love having a version for on the go.  I recommend this app.
0393337170|5.0|The service was good and the book arrived on time. Also, this book is fantastic. It's a very insightful way of viewing the world and I would strongly recommend it.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|I love it me and my brothers play it all the time. But it looks better in the tablet so I feel left out
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I did not want this book to end! Such an amazing story...it made me LOL, cry, blush and everything in between.  I highly recommend reading this book!!
B002MEW7YY|5.0|Anna Netrebko is always outstanding, and this recording is definitely a prime example of just how outstanding her performances are.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|this app is easy to use, simple, and handy. great for when im too lazy to do a math problem myself
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Best sci fi book I have read in a while. A must! I was drawn to this book by the seemingly overwhelming amount of enthusiastically positive reviews; they were all right.
B004QX07G4|2.0|A lot of funny points and scenes however it couldn't keep my attention because it got old with the fib stories. It was my first book by Ellen- just wish I had enjoyed it more because I adore her!
B00499QUK2|5.0|This is an awesome series!  The acting is good, and the characters seem true to the original even though this is a modern day adaptation.  CBS aired it's version of modern day Sherlock this season as well.  And while I do like the CBS series, it does not compare with Sherlock on PBS.  We cannot wait for season 3 to begin!  Great show!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|We have played this game for quite some time on the computer at home.  I like the variaty of different tile colors & symbols.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I gave this book five stars because overall it was super interesting to read and well written.  As it was told from the father's perspective not all of the questions were entirely answered.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I loved this book so much. It was amazing. I haven't seen the movie but I'm going to rent it tomorrow!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I really enjoyed the fictional story enveloped within a major historical tragedy. I have to say from reading the synopsis to finishing the book, I have a very different viewpoint of changing the past.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|Loved how Rick made Percy Jackson turn into Egyptian in one book. Can't wait till I read the next one!!!!
159413586X|4.0|Haven't read it yet. Due to the large print, it is not as easy to carry around. I hope to enjoy it
B005HSL626|1.0|I hate it if you want a good game go to temple run instead instead of this baloney. Colly bolly don't like
1594135851|4.0|haven't read it yet. the large print was not what I wanted but all that was available. Makes it more difficult to carry around.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|This book is a quick read that you will enjoy and become emersed in Jack London is a true literary master
B008TRUDAS|5.0|What a wonderful book. It turned out to be unexpectedly different then I thought it would be. You can feel the love pouring out of this book!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't put the book down.  page after page.  hard to put down. almostdone with tis book.  ready for book three.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|We added this to our traditions, because it shows so clearly that every life that God creates is part of His great plan.  Reminds us that doing the right thing, come what may, has far reaching consequences as well!
B00280LYIC|5.0|Best book I've read in quite some time.  Was a nice page turner and never a boring moment :) .
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game and can play it for hours. I look forward to the dancing card at the end of each game that I win.
B008Z9YGEE|2.0|Sillyl premise and boring. I don't know why it got the rating it did. I have nothing more to say.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This was a great book for casual reading. For a shorter book it went into great depth with the characters and had a good mix of humor and seriousness.  Definitely worth reading
B0096CDG0O|5.0|Dice with Buddies is a very fun game to play. sometimes I win &hellip; sometimes I don't. but even if I loose I am still having fun.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Started this first book of the Reacher series at the urging of a colleague. I am so glad that I took his advice. Great read and each book has wonderful characters.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's  love it . So awesome .SO CUTE.OMG I MIGHT HAVE TO GET YOUR OTHER  GAMES.AMCURRIER@EMBARQMAIL<br />THE END finest  game in the world
B001NHNG64|4.0|Really really enjoyed this book. It starts out fast-paced and it never lets up. Characters are wonderful and the situation is 100% believable!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|One of those movies you think is stupid the first time you see it. Then each time it's on, you plop down and watch it. Funny, touching, and very easy to relare to. The deleted scenes include &#34;Bernie's Christmas Wish&#34;. Look for it on YouTube/ You will laugh until milk come out of your nose, even if you don't drink milk.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I'm such a great fan of G5 games I enjoy playing this hidden object game. but I really would respect you more you will let us know that the game is five buck. believe when I tell you. if anybody out there who plays like I do it would notbe a problem to spented five bucks. all and all I payed for the full game and I'm so loving it. I recommended the game. Pay for it. its worth it.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|My family can't get enough of this movie.  The voice actors were perfectly chosen. Funny little one-liners, &#34;that's just weak song writing. You wrote a bad song Petey.&#34; That line makes us laugh every time!<br />If you've read the book and haven't seen the movie you will wonder how they could turn this short story into a full length movie.  Of course they added more story-line and while I usually hate that sort of thing the writers did a great job.<br />My kids are 16, 13, and 11 (husband is 38) and they watch this movie over and over.
0345472322|5.0|An excellent book on the way you think about life. How you think about things influences your success. I would recommend this book.
B00005JM02|5.0|When I first saw this movie I hated Albert Brooks voice.  Ellen Degeneres made the movie for me.  Now, I don't notice how annoying Albert's voice because I think of it as part of the 'annoying dad' character.<br />Great movie.  Funny, funny, funny.  My family watches this all the time, so much so that when we borrow it to friends we can't wait to get it back.
0061339202|5.0|An excellent book about motivation and being in the moment.A book on how to find happiness and fulfillment. I would recommend this book.
B003L7DK74|5.0|Great show.  Too bad it only lasted 2 seasons but really how much longer could it have went on?  My whole family loves this show.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  It really got me to realize how people take their lives for granted, and that i am truly blessed for the life i live today. Thanks jaycee dugard for helping me realize this!
B007Q0K9TE|5.0|My father is an avid Andre Rieu fan. AVID. He absolutely loves this DVD and watches &#34;The Holy City&#34; over and over again - and cries every time. I couldn't have given him a better gift thie Christmas. It will bring him hours of enjoyment for years to come.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|its fun I tried it on my brothers kindle and it was funish!.!.!.? I give if a 4 out of 5
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Great movies first off, but the bluray digital copy combo is fantastic. We downloaded the iTunes copy and now we have access to the movie anywhere. Would highly recommend.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Forget the movie.  Read the book.  The movie leaves out 3/4 of the story, and it's a story worth reading.  Others have nit-pik'ed away at the book, but I don't agree with their complaints.  For me it was a 658 page page-turner that I read in one day.  I have since read the two sequels.  They are the only kindle books that I have wanted badly enough to pay the full kindle price for.  I am totally intrigued by the character of Lisbeth Salander.  She is a gritty, quirky, hacker-genius unlike any character I have ever run across in life or fiction.  Nobody fxxks with Lisbeth Salander and gets away with it, yet she is a supremely private person.  Can't explain.  Just read the books and discover her for yourself.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|First time to comment on an ebook but I am really loving this one.  Only a quarter of the way through (I only read about a half hour each night before turning off the lights) but  it's turning into a real page turner for me.  Very different from most stories as it is written as a personal log.  Hoping it will continue to keep me entertained the rest of the read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|So glad I got the whole series on a kindle daily deal.  This series kept me turning pages for four days.  Never heard of the author, but if I run into anything else by him on a daily deal, it's going on my new kindle paperwhite.
B0086700CM|5.0|Can not stop playing it.<br />Love it better playing it on kindle then an I phone. Would love it if they made a temple run two.
B0011TMGKG|4.0|My son loves it, I love it. I can attach it to his stroller, car seat, playmat and bouncer. The colors are vibrant and will have even me staring at it sometimes. I just wish it didn't attract so much lint.
B006LRUVUA|5.0|Awesome program. Very helpful, I would recommend it to just about anyone. Great for students if you can't take your computer to class.
B000CNESU8|1.0|This DVD did not play all the way through.  I didn't play it right away and didn't save the packaging, so I didn't try to return it.
B00899F0G8|5.0|This series has Good acting... especially for a teenage drama. And I am waaaay past my teen years and I still enjoy watching it. . Lol.
B002P79KAC|5.0|Just fun! Characters are interesting and the situations funny. I am a fan of any type of sit com and this is the only one I watch.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love it it is fun to play and you have to place coin just right to get ahead in the game.
0689835604|5.0|Definitely a cute book. Our baby loved it so much he ate it! The remainder of the book gets looked at every day by our baby
B005IGZUTC|3.0|A romantic love story in another country that is interesting and easy to read. overall an interesting concept for readers to enjoy
1401211909|5.0|This version of the book is magical. I can't believe I found a new (still wrapped in plastic) copy for such a reasonable price.
B008OOYALE|5.0|One of the few \\"free\\" games that allows you to reasonably advance without having to spend real money.  I have noticed good updates based on user input.....in other words, the \\"created\\" is paying attention.  Keep up the good work :)
055338466X|2.0|Naturalistic Darwinian evolution cannot account for the Laws of Logic which isn't natural, therefore evolution is false. People playing with mathematical formulas writing philosophical books trying to refute philosophy have a god hating/ atheistic agenda up their sleeve. I love Newton; the man had a brain for natural science and a humble heart and reference for the God of the Bible. The intelligent atheist really makes a fool of himself trying to refute the God of the Bible for it's as the bible states in Proverbs 22:30, There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the Lord. These atheists are up against God and that's why they are contradicting themselves without knowing it. For a refutation of `The Big Bang theory' read John Hartnett's book, `Dismantling the big bang'.
B009IA3O2O|4.0|I was very disappointed when I heard that Roy Khan was leaving Kamelot. How could they replace him? Oh, I heard about this new \\"Tommy\\" guy but in my opinion, Roy was the heart of the band and it wouldn't be the same without him.<br /><br />I was right. It isn't the same. Nevertheless, it's certainly not bad. Not by any means. To be completely honest, I like Tommy's voice much better than Roy's- it's a lot smoother, with less of a harsh, forced tone in the higher registers. His vibratto is also a good deal toned down. He's different, but not in a way that diminishes the band.<br /><br />I cannot say the same of his lyrical skills, unfortunately. Roy was a master with words; Tommy's efforts are adequate. They're not bad, but they're not as deep as I would have expected for a mature group like Kamelot, which was disappointing. And yet I gave a four-star rating to this album. Why? It's an oddly brilliant album. The only songs that really stand out to me as truly excellent are Sacrimony and Falling like the Fahrenheit. Despite this, the album as a whole is a near-masterpiece. Individually, the songs are merely \\"good\\" at best, and yet the album as a whole is excellent. It's not meant to be taken apart, piece by piece. It should be listened to as an entire story, each song a chapter. Pick it apart, and you lose what makes a story good: progression, with each part advancing the whole.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I use it every morning. I listen to the radio when I go to bed and it plays louder than my radio and wakes me up.
B002XMGGJM|5.0|One of my favorite movies, its intense and keeps you thinking.  Had to get since the price was so low.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Very good book. The best. Read it on 3 days. Could not put it down. Wish there was another book

B0054R6BFM|5.0|BEAUTIFUL!!!! This is, by far, one of the best teen books I have ever read. It teaches a beautiful lesson that all life is precious, and that we never know what others are going through. Thank You Jay Asher, an unforgettable read!!!!

B009HQ9UHC|5.0|THIS GAME IS SO FUN. I JUST DOWNLOADED IT. ITS NOT HARD TO LEARN, BUT ITS A FUN LITTLE CHALLENGE. I LOVE THIS GAME, WAY BETTER THEN ANGRY BIRDS!!!!!!!!!

B00AGH6FD8|5.0|A naughty kid named Kevin boards the wrong plane and ends up in New York while his family is in Miami and the fun begins.  Kids don't try Kevin's tricks at home!
B0061PEAUY|4.0|The process of solving the crimes was interesting with a twist as most of her novels.  It does getting annoying sometimes however when Bones puts herself in a dangerous situation that anyone with common sense would have avoided.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I've been left with no choice but to buy the other two books. Incredible. Now just waiting on the movie!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was a very good book, and it kept me reading to the end. I loved it for the most part, but of the three, Mockingjay was my least favorite. Katniss messed up at the end and I don't like the way she turned out. Other that that it was a great book and I love how the characters continued to grow, till the very end.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This movie was just as awsome as the first one! I plan to order both for my library collection :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I started this book at 10pm last night and found myself staying up till 5am finishing the book this morning.  Its a great read and I recommend it to everyone who's looking for a good book. Be warned, it's hard to put down once you start reading it.
0792833686|5.0|Iwas pleased to get a DVD of this musical. I currently have it Laser Disc and one of these days it will quit. I had only been able to find on Blue Ray. I played the movie with no problems. Veryu pleased with the delivery.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Fun game... I especially love the sounds the little frog makes! Cracks me up every time!  I could waste hours playing this game if left to my own devices.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|An excellent cast, a great story, this movie was heartwarming and thoroughly enjoyable. It's more of a drama than the previews would lead you to believe, but it's not traumatic. I definitely recommend it.
B0011TMOIK|4.0|I got this for my kindle because I knew the kids would want to watch it multiple times, and it occupies them during long trips.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|by far one of the most amazing apps ever<br />it will have you addicted at just the sight of downloading!!<br />you could even call it better than angry birds  :-D
B0081SRJSY|4.0|I play Carcassonne occasionally with friends and was looking for an online version which would enable me to practice.  This is a great reproduction of the board game and allows you to play human players as well (not over the web, but on the same screen).  My only complaint is that I wish there was a way to bypass the lengthy point-totalling process.  Maybe there is a way, but I haven't found it.  Otherwise, it's great.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|It is free to download, but the functionality of free mode leaves it unplayable. You have to purchase tokens to keep playing.
B0000VCZK2|4.0|I got this for my husband for Christmas. It was a great gift with lots of extra features. He looks forward to watching them all in order.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the book first and then six months later I saw the movie. As is usually the case, the book was much better. That is probably because the book is laid out the way the author intended. The setting of a post-apocalyptic world is common, but a government controlled future is so plausible it could come true. Punishment by reminding the subjects of their folly in resisting a cruel government by establishing an annual death game is such a shockingly real possibility that a reader can feel like he is almost reading our possible future. Genre fiction has infinite possibilities. Because of this, a writer cannot please all readers of this niche. That is why some people will find faults; that is why you can't please everyone. I loved this book. I could not put it down until my dozing off at three am caused the kindle to bounce off my face. I love action, survival, and hand to hand combat--this book fed my hunger for edged weapon warfare in a futuristic setting. This is where our world could go, I hope it does not, but it could.<br /><br />Brian K Kerley -- author of 'The Octagon Key'
B004Y042N8|3.0|I got this as the free app of the day from Amazon today.<br /><br />This should have been a 5 star app, but I will explain why I am giving this one only 3 stars below.  But first I wanted to mention that if you are a fan of the Grabarchuk puzzle book series available for the Amazon Kindles, you will most likely enjoy this app.  It is basically a group of puzzles where you simply connect the dots without tracing over the same lines twice.  It is a very simple game to learn even for a child.<br /><br />However, I am giving this one only 3 stars out of the 5 even though it should have been a 5 star app for the following reasons:<br /><br />1.  Levels have to be be done in a certain order.  You can't skip to do the first puzzle on one the higher levels.<br /><br />2.  Undo Last Move button is inconveniently accessed though the menu button at the bottom.<br /><br />3.  There is a lack of a high score chart or number of moves counter to keep track of how many times it took for you to complete a level.<br /><br />4.  The hand in the memory mode throws you off when you are playing that mode.  I found myself wanting to draw the line from the start of where the hand is when it is finished drawing!<br /><br />5.  There probably needs to be more levels for smarter players.<br /><br />If the app maker addresses all those issues above, they would have a 5 star app in my opinion.  But if you like puzzles, this is still probably worth the .99 cents when it isn't free.
1451695187|5.0|Clearly, Dr Alexander was well trained in critical thinking, and as a trained scientist and observer, was better equipped to describe his experience on the other side... a blessing for all of us.  My own dad had a similar experience, but would not talk much about it for twenty years..  he worried about being thought crazy.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Rich story of individual accountability and growth though adversity.  An exploration in the human condition and the principles of leadership.  A great sci-fi context that keeps you hooked to the last page.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It is such fun roaming around on facebook.  I really enjoy seeing all the pics of my beautiful grandchildren and my friends families.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I love this case.  I use it many different ways and never have a problem.  Great buy for your Kindle.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This is a novel every woman should read at least once. It's a timeless classic. Perfect for all ages, even great as a bedtime read aloud.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Easy to use and never had a problem using it.  I recommend this product highly.  Don't hesitate to try it.
B005FISBTO|4.0|First, Showtime's use of promos and unwillingness to avoid spoilers is inexcusable.  I recently caught up with this series on DVD (since I'm not a Showtime subscriber), but before I even started, I saw the Season 7 promos on another channel that revealed the big twist at the end of Season 6.  If there was any doubt remaining in my mind, seeing the cover of the Season 7 DVD only confirmed what I had already had spoiled.<br /><br />And it's really too bad because entertainment-wise, I found this to be one of the better overall seasons of Dexter...similar to the excellent Season 4 in many ways (guest star serial killer pursued, Dexter lets him get away several times struggling with his own issues, finally takes care of business, but then an absolute shocker in the last 5 minutes of the season throws the entire series in doubt again).<br /><br />To the people who say that Season 6 was very lazy in plot at times, I really have no defense to that.  What I would say is that \\"leaps of faith\\" have ALWAYS been required of the fanbase.  This is not a procedural police drama.  For example, it's not \\"The Wire\\".  But if you accept Dexter for what it is, it can be the funniest, most creative, and scariest show you'll watch, often within the course of a single episode.<br /><br />I thought that Colin Hanks and Edward James Olmos were decently compelling guest stars, certainly more compelling than Julia Stiles' performance of Season 5, which I was not a fan of.  And the conclusion sets up a HUGE cliffhanger for Season 7.  But Showtime really needs to cool it with the obsessive promos, \\"previously on\\", and \\"next time on\\" bits, which might help casual fans, but also tend to spoil much of the plot.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I will like this app much better when I can play my Zynga games with it.  Keeps me current as to what's happening on facebook.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Easy to play, little hard to see on the Fire's small screen.  Nice colors and backgrounds.  Fun to play and to kill time.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I am not great with these games but I have a lot of fun playing it.  Helps to relax after a hard day.  It's doubly great since it's free.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|The book is not bad but needs some serious editing and/or find other examples to better explain habit forming. I was expecting more of a how-to approach to quit bad habits, how to form better ones and how to make them stick.<br /><br />Instead I get a rather medical approach, which is fine, but the author goes on and on and on and on with the same Eugene example which made it quite difficult to enjoy because it feels like he's betting a dead horse.<br /><br />The book starts off quite well but just descends into boredom quite quickly.
B001T6PXFG|5.0|A wonderful, hilarious, and suspenseful true story that will stay with you for quiet a while after watching the film. A must watch. This is by far one of my favorite movies of all time. There are not many films that I can watch over again, but this one, I feel, I will never get tired of.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I have just completed The Fall of the Giants and being a real Ken Follett fan I have to say I was somewhat disappointed,I read Pillars of the Earth and World  Without End and these books were great, but with this book I thought it was a little hard to believe with all the coincidental meetings of people in the far ends of the world, I felt he also tried to put too much history into one novel and in doing so I felt too much was left out and that he just skimmed over a great deal and somewhat of a history fan I felt a little let down,but in saying all this I still was emppressed by the story and I hope that the next book will be better but then maybe Im a little spoiled by his other books.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|As always, Rick Riordan brings his readers into a page turning tale that you will not want to put down.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie wasn't what I thought it would be, my experience has been that the funnier the previews I have seen for it the less funny it would actually be. This movie however passed my expectations. I thought it had the perfect mix of comedy and romance!  My husband, who hates \\"chick flicks\\" even watched it with me and wanted to watch it more than once because he found it funny!  And fat Amy is hilarious!!!
B009L7MD44|4.0|This product is more versatile than others as it turns any USB storage devices into your additional storage for ipad.<br />However, it is letdown by the connection glitch that occurs if you disconnect and connect the wifi connection within a short duration.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series was amazing.  It had an ending that was expected but not at the same time.  Collins is an amazing author!
B005URRCUY|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for the wife, and she has really been enjoying it. She must be, she keeps it in the car so I've yet to hear it.
1449410243|5.0|After reading this book it is very clear that my cat is plotting to kill me. I have decided to take up martial arts to defend myself.  Thank you for saving my life.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my wife and she has really been enjoying it. Naturally you have to like their music for this review to help
B005IEF27O|3.0|Pretty decent album. Obviously Primus is not the same as their older stuff, and you can see the transition over the past few albums. Typical of most bands that have been together for 25 years (i.e. Metallica). It has grown on me though, still a track or two that I can live without. I did see his tour in 3-D. One of the best shows I've ever seen. Unfortunately the venue was small. If Primus played in front of Roger Waters wall in a large venue, you'd be trippin' balls. I can certainly see the future of concerts going this route and hope that Les get's a little credit.<br /><br />Still, as always, Primus sucks!
1455523550|5.0|Nicholas Sparks does it again.  A great book for Sparks lovers.<br />Better than watching the movie.  It is a good book.
B000FBFMFW|5.0|I have to admit this is one of the better trilogies I've read in a while, especially considering the typical happy endings.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for fantasy with good development of characters and a great story.  I liked this so much better than the Game of Thrones.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to learn, generally not time consuming...except it's a bit addictive!<br /> Really enjoy the mini brain vacations.  The graphics are good too.
B00867GJYK|5.0|I have waited to get this on blu ray since the first time I saw it!!  The picture quality is fantastic!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I would definitely recommend this game, it's free and fun and a good way to pass time. Even better on the Kindle!
B001EBWITA|1.0|I really did not care for this film at all. The visual effects were pretty good, but the acting overall was just terrible.
1558908846|5.0|I bought this some time ago and is very happy with my purches. I would surly tell my friends to buy one.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is one of Grisham's better later efforts.  A real page turner with a new point of view.  Good read!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I bought this some time ago and is very happy with my purches. I would surly tell my friends to buy one.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was great if you loved the Percy Jackson series you will love the heroes of Olympus especially the mark of Athena

B003NHRGSQ|5.0|This is zoo good. This history have a lot of good parts! como lectora biling&uuml;e se me hizo super f&aacute;cil de leer y entender!! se las recomiendo!
B000GCFO0I|3.0|First with regard to Blu-Ray, I suspect the above reviewer was using an inferior television. The picture was sharp and superb almost to the point of distraction sometimes, but I suppose that's the point of using Blu-Ray.
B008K8X0IS|5.0|I received this as a gift for my birthday and I must say I was so thrilled! It is well packaged and the dragon's egg is very cool. It is of substantial weight and has a metallic base with Game of Thrones etched into it. I hope they produce two more eggs to complete the set.<br />Tons of extras !
B004QX07G4|5.0|This book is tremendously written! Ellen is witty and insightful in her style--plus,her advice is actually good! Bonus! Seriously..I'm kidding was a such a fun book! I would recommend it to anyone!
B00A2BTCTC|5.0|I always thought it doesn't get any better than this when the original remaster came out, but boy I was wrong! Superior depth for the 5.1. It is like listening to it for the first time. I bought the super edition almost exclusively for the comic book. I am an avid comic reader/collector and I thought what could be cooler than an visual interpretation of one of the best rock albums of all time. I was not dissappointed in this set at all
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was a very moving book with a very sad storyline. Very insightful. This award a great read. Highly recommend this book. If you liked The Help you will like this book.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|You'd think it'd be boring b/c of the journal type way it's written, but it's really good. Lol quite a few times. I enjoyed reading it, seemed very real as if you'd have the same kind of luck and be swearing b/c of it too.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|I wish it had directions to get you started and a restart. I am new to the games,so maybe I just dont know how to find this info.
B003QSEKTU|5.0|I could watch this movie 100 more times!! I think I will watch it again. Easy to download and replay.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Really fun game. Also very addictive. I'm not interested in paying for the extra levels but the free ones are pretty awesome and there are a lot of them.
B007XHWROK|5.0|My granddaughter loves him & she thinks he is hot. She thinks it sounds awesome.Buy it is sounds good by me. Everyone should buy it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My 15 year old daughter recommended that i read this series of books and i was not disappointed. I am working on the second book, girl on fire
B007IXWKUK|2.0|And I was disappointed.  The romance is elementary, the writing is not all that good, and honestly, when I read the errotic scenes, I just get exhausted.<br /><br />This book is just a worse, drawn out, awful version of the first train wreck.<br /><br />That being said, I did go on to read the first, because I can't quit a series halfway through...
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Almost through reading it and I am really enjoying it....he is one of most favorite authors.....did find myself skimming over some of the descriptions.....and it was a bit too long between exciting incidents, but for the most part, I loved it.  John Corey's humor is wry and aptly placed.....
B007IXWL2C|1.0|And it will be the death of me.  I hated the second book.  I didn't even especially like the first.  However, the first was a train wreck that I couldn't tear my eyes away from.<br /><br />The second one, on the other hand, was just awful.<br /><br />The third one, which I felt the need to read because, as I said above, I can't just not finish a series, was even more disappointing.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A good tie up. Sad but that is to be expected in a book centered on a war. If you like this series try Graceling
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Seriously.  You shouldn't get pleasure out of it, but you do.<br /><br />This book is super addicting, but in the long term it sucks.  You won't be able to put it down, but looking back at it, you just keep thinking... &#34;enh...&#34;
B007FEFLTO|1.0|The Kindle is very unreliable. I have not had a good experience with the refurbished Kindles. Send me a BRAND NEW KINDLE!
1433502410|5.0|I use the ESV Study Bible to do my Bible study.  The study notes are very clear and informative.<br /><br />The titles for each section are helpful.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love to play mahjong solitaire and this game is great. It is also very professional in this no charge category
B00005NGAK|4.0|Excellent service. Almost as good as the live show.  I will probably give someone a gift of this show at some time in the future.
B002UD56I6|5.0|Always been a Michael Jackson and Jackson family fan.  This is a very great DVD and shows all the great talent that Michael had.
B0038CP8SG|4.0|Now, so many years after the making of this film I ask myself: How come there isn't more like this? If this is porn, it certainly is porn for all -- and, top-quality.
B000301YY8|5.0|Very good Cd and hae a great collection of songs on it.  Firs heard him on on of the tv's CSI shows.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I bought this book last day of 2012 and read it almost every night in bed before sleep. I finished reading it today. The language is simple as most of it is written in a journal format, but the plot is definitely intriguing. My heart was beating as fast as the woman in the book as she was reading the last few pages of her journal which were cut out by the &#34;husband&#34;. Love can truly bring as much happiness as it can bring craziness and misery. Once memory is lost, a person can become so vulnerable. Yet when you have it all, you may not want to keep some of the memories.
B006ISJQBM|5.0|This is a great movie to add to your collection.  It is funny and what can we say...it has Johnny Depp in it!!!
B00A757EFW|5.0|Great fun game just like I remember! My kids enjoy it too! I am glad I found it on Amazon.
B0072GPPNC|5.0|I bought this move to add to my collection of DVD's.  It is a wonderful movie and there is no way to describe the difference between regual viewing and Blue-Ray.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Glad I waited to read the book before watching the movie. So good I couldn't put it away and finished it in 2 days. That says a lot for me.
B001HN69B8|5.0|I really loved this movie.  Mainly purchased it because it was Heath Ledgers last film he made.  He was a great actor and he is vey missed.  Also have Johnny Depp and Judd Law in it...it just had a great cast and very good story line.
B003O86FMW|4.0|SO enjoyed this book! Can't wait to read this final book in the series and see how it all ends!
B001GCUNYO|5.0|This is a very great movie.  The scene where he hears his daughter being abducted is so so scary.  Great actors and crew.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed the descriptive feedings.  Action with insight to the intensely devious hunger games. Looking forward to the next book.
B00186DV1U|5.0|This is a very good DVD.  Clink Eastwood is his usual self and that is always a very ood job.
0446580848|1.0|My son and I are AVID DeMille readers, looking forward to every new book he publishes...........this, by far is the worst. Yes, there are some LOL moments, as there always is with John Corey, but the narrative was never ending, the quotation marks annoying, (along with \\"& Buck also said this, and Paul also mentioned that\\". Please, if it's in quotations, I can figure out who is talking. The style was so different from novels in the past that I thought he might have had a ghost writer. I am waiting for another book like \\"Gate House\\" which kept us on the edge of our seats, and even \\"The Lion\\" which I thought was intriguing. I recommended this to 1st time DeMille readers BEFORE I read it, and wished I hadn't. Needless to say, they were not impressed.......please Mr DeMille, bring back the Sutters!
B0000667RO|3.0|This CD was okay but it is not one of my favorites.  Did not like the songs that much in it.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I went for this book due to the high review rate, but now I think those who could get through this must all have been teenage girls. Nicely written, but the voice was way older than that of the main character.
B002ZG997M|5.0|This is a fantastic movie if you like a lot of action.  I am a woman but I like action movies ...if it isn;t blowing something up and a lots of fights...it doesnt' keep my attention.  This movie does.
B002RI9UBS|2.0|I found this book difficult to get through and could only read it in short bursts. The end twist was unexpected and in some ways a bit of a let down. The main character's self talk and descriptions were consistent but I certainly won't read it again. While not saying it was unpleasant, I couldn't really recommend it to anyone wishing to have a relaxing easy read.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|This is a fantastic movie  based on true story DVD.  All of the actors and crew did a fantastic job in this movie.
B000JML7EC|5.0|I love to read this old classics, even thought I have read them in the past. How can you go wrong. Literature as it should be. Read great on my iPhone app and my Kindle 4.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This was an excellent movie.  Lots of action and had a wonderful story line with it. In fact the ending was great too, left questions in your head..haha.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|A bit of an odd read, but I enjoyed it a lot. Makes you think a bit about life, but was entertaining, and a neat mystery. Read great on my iPhone Kindle app and on my Kindle 4.
B002ZG9774|5.0|this was a fantastic movie.  It has wonderful characters in and a very good story line.  I have like Cher ever since the 60's and she is still just as beautiful.
B003Y5H5AQ|3.0|Good kids movie. I loved the smurfs as a kid, so I was disappointed it was more like a smurf docu-drama.For more smurf fun, try the iTouch / iPad Smurf villiage app.
B001OQCV2O|5.0|This is a great action movie with a great story line.  Reminds me a lot of some of the stuff that did happen to us during 2012.
B00000FC5H|5.0|If you like Earth Wind and Fire, you will certainly find this CD to be one of your favorites. I did.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This was a really well written book, but not the young love/romance I was expecting at all.  I think the actual story was just terribly depressing & not what I was looking for.
0789325772|5.0|Very cool retro look. Great drawings. Love it. Bought all three in the series. New York, San Francisco and London. Highly Recommended.
B00064VR0W|5.0|i bought this for my dad and i had seen it before and i really like it the best DVD of Rod
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love It!  It's big enough that I don't need glasses, percentages are a breeze, all I need right here and did I mention it's a FREE application!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Best season yet.<br /> Although I have enjoyed them all very much,<br />Season 10 is a great combination of drama, great plots and actors.<br />Combine all this with an unforced and dry sense of<br />humor, I cannot imagine  a more enjoyable series.<br />I own them all.<br /> Thank you, and please keep on enriching<br />my otherwise mundane life.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|My daughter had mention that this show was a program that we would enjoy, and we started watching it. And she was right.
B0095R4M8A|5.0|Wonderful movie that I love to watch over and over (every night for over 4 years and still watch it weekly). It just comforts and relaxes me and makes me feel safe.  I wish movies today were half as good as this one!!!
B0085GUXZI|4.0|bought this record for our grandson, he is collecting all of pink floyd albums. hope to help him get them.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Being a fairly new app user I found this one really easy to get around on.  Fun game...very addictive.<br /><br />,
030759565X|5.0|I received this book for Christmas after being a fan of Deb's blog for a few years now. I love her pragmatism, eloquent comedic wit and writing style-- it seems like she's writing it just for ME, the home cook living with a small cooking area and very limited storage space for unusual ingredients and gadgets.  As others have already so astutely pointed out, her recipes are tried, true, and failproof. I have cooked countless other recipes from fancy cookbooks and magazines, many of which have been outstanding... and many of which have also fallen into the \\"I'd rather eat shards of glass\\" categories. Deb's cookbook is great because her recipes are CONSISTENT, fun, interesting and RELIABLY good. I KNOW she won't include a recipe that she doesn't give an outstanding rating or stand behind at 100%.  My only issue is that while I love the warm and heartfelt stories (and photography!) behind each recipe, the recipes can be a little hard to follow with all the text-heavy pages. Last weekend I made the very forgiving mushroom bourguignon, and despite re-reading the directions a dozen times (while multi-tasking and making another dish in tandem) I skipped a step and wound up with too much liquid. While this ended up being a happy accident that didn't alter the success of my meal, I would prefer that recipe directions are in a bullet-style or numbered format rather than in paragraph form (just my preference as a very slow, methodical and somewhat novice/intermediate cook, so I won't deduct any stars.) That aside, I can't wait until I make my next Smitten dish!!  I made three items from her book this past weekend, and they were ALL five-star. I blew my gourmet foodie dinner guests (and my Better Half) away with the deliciousness. Thanks a ton, Deb!! (P.S. This is my very first Amazon review if that speaks to my love for this book.)
B00AL1ONN8|4.0|I am a huge fan of Mr. tip Harris. I think that he is at his best when his music reflects what's going on his life. I feel the club songs could have been left off.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love the graphics.  Very clear and colorfull.  Picture is very sharp and game can be played with both 3 card draw or single card draw
B0063IH60K|4.0|Would be 5 stars except the pop up doesn't want to skip often. The game works great. You should try it too :-)
B006WQLH7G|5.0|i use Avast on my home system so know they are good. I am happy to say the mobile version is as good.  I have it on my Kindle as well as my phone.
B0052RDHTM|3.0|The characters are interesting and their stories are interesting, but the book spends too much time on WW1. I am not a fan of war time battles and there are far too many and too much detail. It made the book too long unless you wanted an in depth portrayal of the battles and hardships of WW1.
0064430227|5.0|This is a classic that you want to share again and again. My children love it. Book Recommended<br />Wang Mind the greatest of the great pandas<br />Happy animals<br />Alaska's ABC Bears
B001NFNFIK|5.0|Had never seen or heard of this movie when it played at the theaters.  I enjoyed watching the DVD very much.
B0095P31L6|1.0|very bizarre movie.  tried to watch it w/my 2 yr old & hubby.  kid was too tired to care, but i had to stop 1/2 way through and i always finish a movie or a book no matter what.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I liked the book but I still keep looking for the tense, suspenseful books of years gone by. But even so, it was a pretty good read.
1449410243|5.0|See above. 18 more words required for this review to be complete? Here are three.  Here are four more. Bye!
0385366752|5.0|This book is outstanding.  You really don't know what will happen at the end.  It is nerve-wracking.  Anyone who wants to read something well-written and enjoyable should read this.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|This movie is as good as the past movies.  I am looking forward to the next.  The download was super fast too.  I was so nice to be able to watch a movie on my Kindle Fire in the car, it made a long trip much better.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this series!! I enjoy time-period shows/movies such as Downton Abbey. They stay true to that time in history.<br />The actors are wonderful. It is not about just the aristocrats but about the middle and poor classes and their problems, hopes, and dreams too.<br />I would highly recommend.
B008R5OJXE|3.0|I add my voice to those who found this recording a little lifeless.  As has been mentioned in another review, it's a tough opera to present on CD.  It's long, and difficult to cast.  Cesare presents all kinds of problems as far as casting goes.  To put it simply, there will never be another Senesino, the castrato for whom the role was written.  So what kind of voice, that exists now, is right for Cesare?  Somebody like Andreas Scholl, who seems to me to be THE stage Cesare of our time, is probably not the perfect choice for a CD Cesare.  On stage, he is a tall, handsome presence.  But while his technique is nearly flawless, his timbre is perhaps, at times, not entirely suitable.  For a CD recorded Cesare, stage presence is irrelevant.  Only the voice matters.  Curtis selected Lemieux for his Cesare, and at times it seems like a good choice.  Her lower range is strong, and the slower arias are rendered prettily, if a bit dull.  Lemieux seems not to be able to handle the fast coloratura required in arias like Al Lampo Dell'Armi.  She was not able to articulate the notes as written and substituted her own composition for many of the long melismas.  She is better on Quel Torrente, where Curtis takes a rather ponderous tempo.<br /><br />This brings me to my sort of ultimate question: why add a recording of this opera with nothing new to say?  I appreciate Alan Curtis's dedication to recording Handel.  He has provided up-to-date recordings of plenty of rare operas.  Where else could someone hear Deidamia, or even, say Fernando?  But there are several very good Giulio Cesare recordings out there already:  Jacobs, Minkowski, Petrou, et al.  There is nothing new about this recording.  If Curtis decided to, say, try a countertenor as Cesare, that might have been an interesting contribution to the catalog.  If he had been experimental with tempi, or tried a radical rethinking of the treatments of the recits, it might be worthwhile to add another recording to the pile.  But this is simply a by-the-numbers recording.<br /><br />Speaking of countertenors, a word should be said about the Tolomeo here, Filippo Mineccia.  Curtis has categorically eschewed countertenors on his recordings for a few years now, for whatever reason.  So it is strange that when he finally drafts one, he turns not to great countertenor, but a problematic one.  Mineccia's timbre is not for everyone.  I happen to love most countertenor voices, and welcome them on almost any recording, but Mineccia's middle register is distinctly unpleasant to me.  His upper extension is quite pretty and powerful, and even evokes Jaroussky at its best.  But anything below the staff is hollow, and sounds like he's merely hanging on rather than a master of technique.  His coloratura is quite impressive, though.  If you don't like countertenors, you may wish to avoid this recording.<br /><br />The rest of the singers are well-described in the other more critical reviews.<br /><br />The recording quality is another puzzle.  At times the sound is quite boxy, particularly the recits.  The orchestra sounds very slick, almost as if they are a MIDI program.  What's odd is that, occasionally it bursts forth from this box.  Empio Diro Tu Sei for instance is a fiery tour de force from the orchestra--the sound of the cellos evokes the sound of a head being loosed from a body, appropriate for Cesare finding Pompey's head delivered to him.  Other Curtis recordings seem to be more naturally engineered.  I don't know if this is a record label thing?<br /><br />In summary, if you have Jacobs, Minkowski, or Petrou, there is little reason to purchase this unless a favorite singer is in the cast.  If you don't like countertenors in general, you probably will skip Tolomeo's arias.  If engineering issues bother you, you might not enjoy the boxy and overly-slick production.<br /><br />I would prefer that Curtis continue to give us new recording of Handel operas that are under-recorded.  Poro, for instance, needs a good modern recording.  Curtis did concert performances of Orlando with Iestyn Davies--that seems like a great potential CD.
034580404X|3.0|Nothing to get attached to but good enough to pass the time. It's the kind of book you only read once and never get the urge to read again.
B000001DQI|5.0|this cd is a must have for any elton John fan.  It has tiny Dancer and Funeral for a Friend.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|Such a high potential that pays off only if you are s***faced or really high. Do not watch unless willing to deal with hackneyed dialogue and b-rate effects.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|All I can say is --- just call me Anastasia Steele, please.  ;)  Not really, but I loved the books.  There wasn't a moment that didn't have my full attention.  I can't wait for the next book.  Not sure how James will be able to top this, though.  I read some place about potential actresses to play Anastasia.  A move?  Really?  That should be interesting!!
B007DIQC90|5.0|Excellent CD.  The female singer has a really unique quality to her voice which really appeals to me and they do some nice harmonies too.  If you like Edward Sharpe, you will probably like this as there are some similarities.  They are not a copycat band though.  Very cool lounge music!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Would be nice if it had a size reducer. The picture quality is great, but need to be able to adjust the size in the window
B008J9EYFG|5.0|Beth has a really beautiful voice and very unique way of phrasing the lyrics.  This is the first album of hers I have purchased and I really love it.  Nice for relaxing.  I can listen to it over and over again!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|No Academy Award for this film but it was certainly fun to watch! If you like the Bourne story you'll enjoy this film.
1936608898|4.0|Who knew tofu wasn't good and eggs are?!  There were a lot of eye openers in this book.  It was the perfect amount of science and practical explanations.  I like that this is a lifestyle and not a diet.
B009DKFSUA|5.0|Was great, got it fine received when promised.<br />Thanks for being truthful and timely. Would recomend to anyone. Thanks again !
B0083GQKQG|4.0|This is a difficult movie -- the difficulty in the content makes it difficult to construct a surpassingly successful film.  It's certainly a valiant effort by the film makers, who produced a thoughtful, provocative, disturbingly touching film.  Ultimately, they had to make a film about very specific characters, but any American watching will find it hard not to think about other facts, other families.  My only concern is that there's a whiff of a suggestion that Kevin's mom's ambivalence about getting pregnant when she did is at the root of his behavior.  If I could, I'd give Swinson ten stars for her betrayal of Kevin's mom.  That said, this isn't four stars because her performance is raising up a three-star movie; I think it's four stars on its own.  Also:  Based on prior reviews I was really afraid there'd be gore or something that would give me a sudden scare.  That was needless worry.  You don't need to sit on the edge of your seat, there is nothing that will make your heart pound.  It's not that kind of movie.

B0036G8IQS|4.0|This is a fun book (1st in series) of a boy who gets kicked out of every school he attends until he discovers he's special.  This reminds me a bit of Harry Potter in that the boy has magical abilities and is unaware of it for his first years.  After reading this, I bought a book to reacquaint myself with the Greek gods and their history.  I will definitely be reading the rest in this series.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Capitalizing on the many popular farming games that havre entered the market through social media venues, this highly detailed game gives players a simple, cute, and fun time. Look out, for here be dragons.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|How blessed we are to have this simple story of striving persistently to reach a goal.  Life is not easy.  Easy means without effort. But we can reach those goals we work for persistently.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|My Niece and I watched this movie together we both enjoyed it.  Good life lesson on taking care of the earth.  But also it showed that it is never too late. People can right wrongs and undo past mistakes.  Its also some pretty funny lines that my Niece couldn't help but repeat. (That's a WOMEN!!!)
031236198X|5.0|Short good read and I would advise anyone in leadership to read the book. The info within the book, make you really think about what you are reading.
1609611543|1.0|Read through this book and was taken aback by the false information that he gives such as claiming that cutting wheat out of your diet will cure your diabetes. Diabetes, Type 1, is from a non-functioning pancreas, I guess if diabetics want to rejuvenate their already dead pancreas, they just need to stop eating wheat. If the author is wrong about something as widespread as type 1 diabetes, then he is wrong about most of his rhetoric.
B0086213XW|4.0|I'm not sure why this movie got so many bad ratings.  I think the plot was somewhat original and believable.  Michelle Williams and Seth Rogen were both wonderful.  Definitely worth the free viewing.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Can't remember the last time I read a book from cover to cover in one sitting!  Immediately went out and bought a copy for my father to read as well.
B004N6369Y|4.0|Danielle Steele is one of my favorite authors, this book draws you in and entrenches you into the life of father and daughter in Hotel Vendome.  Great easy read to enjoy anytime.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Excellent read, amazing considering in our day to day lives we read about killing,violence, etc. Then in a time of killing, and death is expected we find what human beings can be.  Out of war we find hope among its warriors, a certain respect<br />from men who can only cherish each hour they survive....
B0047747A6|5.0|It was great to see Michael Jackson's world through his eyes. I wish he wrote more books. His life is just so fascinating.
B009329Y30|4.0|i wish the ending would be more instead of rushing to wrap up the story. Anyway, it was a good movie.
B004498KPU|5.0|Michael Jackson was a genius in creating short films to match his songs. I love the songs more now that I watched the videos.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Avatar was the first movie I had seen in 3D in a long time. I disliked the fact that when they first released this movie they didn't release it in 3D but now that it's here I can't be any happier. Loved the quality & the graphics in this movie.
B0093OGBL6|3.0|From this book I learned a lot about Michael. I just don't know if the authors sources are accurate. It was an interesting read.
0399226907|5.0|I am addicted to all things ERIC CARLE. I love his book...the concepts are simply and the books are colorful. Couldn't ask for anything more.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|More than a reader. A companion, best TV alternative, it will keep you out of the world calamities, news have become. You won't regret it.
B0096PAA6E|2.0|After a lot of hype from a co-worker, I was excited to order this CD but it was a major let-down.  I was hoping for more blues but there was really only 1 song that was even blusey sounding.  Maybe I need to hear more of his stuff before making a rating such as this....I'll have to see.
B0076DELIG|5.0|The Black Box. Great book-in the style of Michael Connelly. Harry Biscuit is such an honest hero. I always enjoy his adventures.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a fun and addictive game and has some depth to it.  I've only played the &#34;Arcade&#34; version so far and it's been enjoyable enough that I haven't even gotten around to checking out the other Modes yet.  I definitely plan to check out any other games that iTreeGamer may have published.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|The acting is superb and the historical setting of this series in terms of the era and World War I is gripping.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Classic! A fantastic, engaging piece. I can't wait to read the rest of the series. George R.R. Martin is a genius!
B005LAJ16I|4.0|I'm and always will be a Damian Lewis fan (Band of Brothers) not quite sure he was right for this role though. Danes does nuts exceptionally well and pretty much owns the series, SPOILER ALERT: I just had a hard time buying the romantic chemistry between her and Lewis. I think he (Lewis) was outstanding in the action, deception and emotional break down scenes, the romantic scenes with Danes on the other hand seemed awkward. A suspenseful all though far fetched story with good solid performances by the leads and supporting actors sans IMO some chemistry issues. One I'll put on my list for a future BR purchase.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I got a great price on this movie and was glad to be able to get the trilogy set. Purchased gift for husband.  All of the batman movies are good
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|How anyone gets by without this program is beyond me.  I would not be able to do all I do, without it.  I would give it 6 stars were it possible!
0061989142|5.0|Purchased book for my teenage daughter and she loves it. Got lots of ideas of makeup, and what to have in your closet.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain was a heartwarming story written from the prospective of a dog.  Being a dog lover, it was very enteratining and brought many smiles to my face.
B0094KF4WG|4.0|Reasonably fast paced and well explained.  Mark stays away from the politics on the whole and deals with the action.  Good stuff
B001NLKT60|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time. The second book of the series was even better than the first.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|Very pleased with the quality of the dvd & enclosure, it was as if new.  I was happy to give it as a christmas gift to a loved one.  Thanks!
B007THA4FI|1.0|tedious and long winded<br />I have gone out of my way to tell all my reading friends not to bother<br />wasted money..sorry I bought it
B0063IH60K|4.0|Very easy to use arcade style. Its common to find myself playing this game for hours at a time. Well done.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|el tamaño es perfecto para guardar las piezas mas grandes del lego y al tenerlo abierto genera diversión a quien lo este usando
B0041MFOE0|5.0|Was a great Help instead of me fighting the Christmas Crowd!! I did not have to go out in the cold and on Snowy Raods!!! NICE!
B004R2DS9C|5.0|el tamaño es perfecto para guardar las piezas mas grandes del lego y al tenerlo abierto genera diversión a quien lo este usando
B002MUAJ2A|3.0|This book is more like a big article, not really a book. It is like a junction of many blog articles. If you read the blog, you don't need to buy the book. It is nice for those who do not read the blog.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|Loved it when I first got it two weeks ago. Nice graphics, quick response during game play which is useful when you are jumping from train to train or track to track mid-air. I would play the round over and over again to win my missions and within two weeks I was on mission 16. Then bad things started to happen, the game started freezing during the spray painting screen at the beginning, but I clicked wait and everything would be okay. Then the ads for other games started freezing my kindle, quick tap of the power button fixed that. The the nyc update it was okay for one minute then I noticed I was no longer obtaining points,nits like the counter stopped at 58000 and refused to award more points. After two more missions it started adding points again so I was happy. The came the final straw, the game reset. I have to start all over again, oh all heck naw. Delete!
B000SEFIT6|5.0|If you have any doubt about how to estimation and planning works for agile projects, this is the book you need to read. If Product Owner role is not clear, or scope and change control management are unclear, this is the book you need to read.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|Wow.  I remember the Graphic Novel like it was yesterday.  Hands down the greatest Batman story ever told.  I don't care what anyone says, the Frank Miller Batman was the reason for the resurgence and rewrite of his character with these latest movies.  I'm glad they finally put this story to video.  It loses some of it's steam in the translation from print to video but overall it's great!  It's a little cleaned up but there is still the blood and ruthlessness you will expect if you're a fan of the graphic novel.  I highly recommend this to any fan of the book and for those who like the new movies who want to see the inspiration for Christian Bale's Batman.<br /><br />I can't wait to get my hands on the second part!
B004J4XGN6|5.0|Book is great. It organizes the basic concepts about agile product development and who to set business strategy. The pivot concept is quite accurate and it helps technicians to understand why business value is also important for success - I came from a technical background and it is really common to find people that only things about the product, the core technology inside it, but never cares about the business so for me, this book makes sense totally.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I'm not reading anymore of these books because they seem to stop the character development and will never come to an end!<br />Please, Mr. Martin, finish this story!!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Purchased two for gifts and the item is compact and easy to carry with the Mossberg Fixed Skinning Knife and the sharpener<br />for well for the size of of the knife makes a great set.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|Love this story. Very entertaining and the 3d is like an amusement ride! A must have for 3d movie collectors.
1594745692|5.0|I love the box that the cards came in, the booklet, the entire presentation was just awesome. The cards are really thick too! Great quality as well. I don't recommend this deck to beginner readers though. I kind of took issue with some of the bad reviews because one that knows the Tarot well would look at this deck and see that it may be difficult to do some serious readings with them because of the playful imagery.<br /><br />This deck is for readers that are ADVANCED at their skills or just looking for a comical deck to use. I'd recommend this deck for collectors as well. I purchased this deck for that reason but I have decided to implement them in everyday use. I'm confident that I'll get the same results that I get with any other deck.<br /><br />Love it and highly recommend to Tarot lovers out there!
