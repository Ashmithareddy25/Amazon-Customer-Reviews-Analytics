B000022TSW|5.0|This movie would just be another episode of its title show where it not for one thing.  The music!The music is what puts this movie firmly in the ranks of the all time great comedys. Caddy shack, Airplane. the naked gun 1 and 33 1/3rd, American pie,Dare i even say monty python and the holy grail!.  Every song is a classic.   I instantly bought the soundtrack. my personal fav. is the one crooned by the devil him self.  \\"up there\\"  But i also play \\"what would brian boitano do?\\" whenever i need a pick up.    This movie is not however a spoof of musicals.  it IS a musical. and a good one at that.  The songs a catchy and serve to move the story along as well as any disney or braodway musical I have seen. I have poped in this dvd many many times.  and never even touched the fast fwd.     I am not nore have i ever been a big fan of the show.  But i am a huge fan of this film.     When this film came out i did not see it.  All i knew was that it would be the filthiest movie in film history,  and it is. Guiness book of world records.  and infact had to be changed to dodge a x rating.  barly sneeking in under the bar.  and they really didnt tone it down just changed the lyrics to one song.    So if you like good songs.Get this dvd.Enjoy your dayPhiPPs
0671027379|5.0|Imagine this...in the dark remote reaches of the Arctic Circle, you find proof, undeniable, irrefutable truth that there is life on other planets?  Wouldn't you be the most happy person on earth, particularly if you were the embattled and waning NASA?  Darn tootin you would.  And thus sets off this intricate and exciting book by the talented Dan Brown.  Brown follows up his breathtaking \\"Angels and Demons\\" with this tale of deception, power, greed, murder, skullduggery and just out and out non-stop edge of your seat thrills.<br />Rachel Sexton, a \\"gister\\" for the United States, is approached by the president to verify that this remarkable find is indeed the truth.  Once she lands at the site and joins with several civilian scientists, including a handsome Michael Tolland, who is also the host of a popular \\"real life\\" adventure series, she begins to suspect all is not what it seems.  And thereby spins this tale.  Brown has peopled his book with some outlandishly evil and suspicious characters such as the downright ugly Marjorie Tench, who seems almost as powerful than her boss, the President; Senator Sedgwick Sexton, the incumbent's opposition in the upcoming election, who also happens to be Rachel's father.  Sexton will stop at nothing to get what he wants---the power of the presidency.  We also meet William Pickering, Rachel's by the book boss; Gabrielle, Sexton's assistant who has her own agenda for power; and lots of other good and bad guys.  The suspense is relentless, as Brown shifts from scene to scene, leaving mini cliff-hangers along the way.<br />A technical master, Brown has obviously done his homework and his addition of realistic facts and dilemmas adds to the nightmarish tone of the book.<br />A great adventure, maybe not quite as electrifying as Matt Reilly, but still good on a more cerebral level.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
1568496982|5.0|Based on the real life Christina Kay at the James Gillespie school, this classic is a must for anyone who would like to be considered literate in English Literature. Miss Jean Brodie is one of the most complex, idealistic, self-deluded, vulnerable, vital, romantic, preposterous, lonely, gregarious, outspoken and solipsistic character you will ever meet. She is the square on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle whereas others are only the squares on the two sides. Listen to her lessons: \\"Phrases like 'the team spirit' are always employed to cut across individualism, love, and personal loyalitiies. Ideas like 'team spirit' ought not to be enjoined on the female sex, expecially if they are of that dedicated nature whose virtues from time immemorial have been utterly opposed to the concept. Florence Nightingale knew nothing of team spirit, her mission was to save life regardless of the team to which it belonged. Cleopatra knew nothing of the team spirit if you read your Shakespeare. Take Helen of Troy! ... Where would team spirit have got Sybil Thorndike? She is the great actress and the rest of the cast have got the team spirit.

B00005JK8K|2.0|I guess Nicholas Cage isn't being offered the good scripts anymore- and for good reason, the guy is so formulaic now- the surly sufferer- that his acting range is really limited to a short list of registering basic emotions. And John Woo- what a flash in the pan this guy is. The action scenes are awkwardly staged...something Woo is supposed to be great at. The fighter planes are clearly matted in digitally. Explosions occur before guns have fired.There's so many predictable cliches from other battle films stretching back to WW2 films that you get a feeling you've seen everything before- and you have! ...
6305648522|5.0|First of all, I am an 18 year old male who is mainly into action and crime movies.  I usually stay away from everything else.  This movie however, is one of the best movies, let alone dramas, that I have ever seen.  Coming from me, this is an excellent review.  I can watch this movie countless times.  The characters are all interesting, the story is great, and the soundtrack is beautiful and haunting.  This is truly a masterpiece among movies.  No matter what kind of movies you are into, \\"Cinema Paradiso\\" is a must have for any dvd collection.
B00006AW2J|5.0|1968 turned into a very good year for the Stones. Jumpin' Jack Flash and Beggar's Banquet allowed Jagger and Richard to finally emerge from the shadow of Lennon and McCartney. Sure, the Stones produced many great songs before BB, but they were always being compared to The Beatles. The comparison was unfair (both bands had slightly different roots and played a different brand of rock). Beggar's Banquet established the Stones as one of the greatest rock 'n' roll bands around (I say one of the greatest because the argument could easily be made for a number of other bands including The Who).<br />The band had finally found their George Martin. Jimmy Miller's sympathetic production captured the band's raw edge. This is as raspy and as close to the blue as rock ever got. From the stunning opening salvo of percussion, piano and vocals on Sympathy for the Devil to the gospel tinged backing vocals that close out Salt of the Earth, BB proved to be the most consistently brillant album the band would make. Let It Bleed and Sticky Fingers followed on the heels of this great album and, while both are great in their own way, they basically use the blueprint of this terrific album to construct those masterpieces. Let It Bleed ranks up there as one of the band's finest moments but it has a little bit of filler. Every track on BB is essential and works.<br />The sound quality is amazing. Some tracks benefit more from others. The opening track, Jigsaw Puzzle and Parachute Woman all benefit from the razor sharp sound found on this CD/SACD hybird. My only reservation is with the artwork. I really dislike digpaks. They are a bizarre love child of the CD replica of original albums and the CD plastic box format. It's neither fish nor fowl (well, I'd call it foul--if the plastic spindle breaks you can't replace it and it becomes pretty useless as far as storing the CD). The cardboard digipak doesn't stand up to wear and tear very well (then again the original cardboard vinyl sleeves didn't either). I don't know that there's a happy medium here.<br />It would have been nice to include extras (bonus tracks, out takes or even a booklet with lyrics, comments from the band, etc.). Still, I'm happy with the stunning sound quality (I'm not so happy about the UK/US release format that Abkco has used. Personally I would have preferred having bonus tracks from the US releases and then sequenced them myself). Nevertheless, BB along with Let It Bleed, Aftermath, Between the Buttons and Sticky Fingers are essential Stones albums. I know lot of folks would include Exile on Main Street as well but for me it's an over rated album. The sound is murky, the songwriting sloppy on many tracks and it has too much filler (much like The Beatles' White Album--oops there's that comparison again).either).

B00005JKED|3.0|This movie is a sucker in progress.  It doesn't quite suck, but it's not great.  Don't let any big scary people like the Academy award men tell you any different.  The acting is good, but the movie is average.  I like watching Ethan Hawke stoned, because while he's training now, he'll hopefully get physically stoned in his next movie.
0671027344|5.0|This book should be on the reading list of every high school and middle school  in the country. I felt so strongly for the main character and cannot imagine what a child struggling through the process of growing up \\"awkward\\" would feel hearing a voice similar to there own. I read this two years ago and cannot wait to start it again. It is almost painful to read because you feel so deeply for the protaganist and want to reach out  and help him. I cannot recommend this enough. I was never  in his position but it gave me such sympathy. I think it would put feeling back into todays youth if they could read what its like for the underdog.
B00006IUL7|1.0|... Although this movie started out with a \\"Bang\\"~ it left me sitting there when the credits started to roll by wondering \\"Did I miss something\\"~ The ending is a huge disapointment~<br />Would I recommend this movie? ?  50/50~ ...
0395177111|5.0|Wow, where do I begin this review, first of let me say that JRR Tolkien is one of the best storytellers of all time.  He is my favorite along with Stephen King.  This book is full of surprises and twists that will kepp you turning.  I don't really agree with some other reviews that it is intended for children and adults.  I am 17 years old and I still love this type of story-telling, with magic and dragons.  This book, in fact, is one of my favorite.  Tolkien does a fantastic job of character development and describing the surroundings.  I was enthralled with the ending.  I really could not find anything wrong with the book, it is consistent and it kept me turning the pages.  It also does a good job setting the pace to the other Lord of the Rings books.  If you are ever bored and with a few hours to kill, definately pick this one up.
B00005QK3D|3.0|well, pink bubbles isnt the best album they have since there's not that usual heavy helloween sound in it, but this album is ok. When someone is crying is probably the best song in this album.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|.<br />...the BIG question... who would write the score??? I had only heard of Howard Shore from the movies the Client and the Cell, which were scores I liked. But he didn't have those big sweeping epic scores like favorites Zimmer, Williams and Horner. So I was again curious as to what it would sound like. <br />When I first listened to it, I must admit I was surprised. Of course I hadn't seen the film yet, so I was merely going off of the books and pictures of characters for reference. One thing I noticed that was intriguing was the fact that each track was titled after a chapter from the book, in the same order! Which meant basically that each track was written for each specific section of the book, very cool! Actually later I read that Shore laid Tolkien's book open to each chapter and wrote the music to what he read. Again very cool! And Shore incorporated the use of Tolkien's languages into the choral arrangements too, if you buy the Special Edition you will notice some of this in the liner notes, there are lyrics in different languages. <br />So I was surprised at this score at first. It was different than most epics. It didnt have your usual hero theme and villian theme. Instead it had one theme for the Fellowship which cleverly showed itself a piece at a time until track 11, when the whole Fellowship is formed. And a theme for the \\"dark side\\" very dark and ominous, incorporating the Black Speech of Mordor. Then you have the regal and majestic theme of the Elves, very mysterious and wise themes. This is where Enya comes in, with her celtic, and very elvish sounding vocals, giving the tracks a very surreal and powerful tone. And the theme for the Moria sequence is astounding, very powerful drums and strings, gives the listener a tremendous sense of the depth of the mines, and the evil that awaits there, and yet still gives you the majesty of the Dwarf cities, now abandoned to evil. And to end this chapter of the story, Enya finishes with a song of hope for things to come. Very beautiful last touch.<br />I'm very anxious to hear the next 2 scores for the next 2 films. <br />This is a great score, one of the best, not maybe what you would expect, but worth the oscar and the money. True I was disappointed that the only difference in the Special Edition was the cover, but it was worth it.
B000005H40|5.0|This is one of those albums that makes a jazz collection complete. The title track is very good with a nice blend in the opening and the end. The solos are just unmatched. Locomotion is my favorite favorite track becuase of the switch between the short solos and the actual melody. No one solos like Coltrane. Lazy Bird is a nice relaxing tune. GET THIS ALBUM. You will NOT be disappointed.
B00004T8RK|4.0|My frustration with this album is certainly not with the music itself but in the way the album 'sounds' as a result of the unique way it was recorded and produced. <br />Don't get me wrong, some slower/softer tracks, in particular 'Nothing As It Seems' and 'Of The Girl' sound excellent with the 'binaural' recording style that producer Tchad Blake used on this album, but the 'heavier' rocking tracks like 'Insignificance' 'Grievance' & 'Breakerfall' just seem to sound muddy, soft and flat. Infact I believe Brendan O'brien had to re-mix some tracks right before they released the album because the guys felt they were lacking that 'something special'. <br />Mike Mcready's immaculate guitar work goes largely unoticed on this album because it often sounds as though he's playing under water (the exception being 'Nothing As It Seems'). I just can't help listening to this album and thinking how much better it could have sounded if it were produced entirely by Brendan O'brien....perhaps i'm just asking for too much. Nonetheless it is still a 4 star album ... .<br />It seems the guys have got the right idea though on the new album beacuse if Adam Kaspers work with QOTSA & Foo Fighters is anything to go by then the new albums gonna be something special indeed! (but then again, every Pearl Jam album is) Can't wait for it and can't wait for them to tour Australia again next year.
B00006IUL6|4.0|In Insomnia, Al Pacino is an LA cop of dubious reputation who is called upon to investigate a crime in Alaska.  Some call this a more conventional effort from Memento director Christopher Nolan, yet it doesn't play like a standard thriller.  The landscape and especially the long days in Alaska are as much part of the film as the characters.  Pacino is a top notch investigator but is also a fish out of water away from the big city.  He becomes involved more directly as events occur, and there is a great deal of uncertainty as to how things really happened partway into the movie.  Enter Robin Williams, who plays a solitary writer who comes along to \\"assist\\" the investigation of a girl's death.  <br />Williams has done great work dramatically before, and he fits his role in Insomnia perfectly; he plays off against Pacino very well.  Hilary Swank is a local cop, relegated to minor insignificant duties by her male colleagues, and she both idolizes Pacino's character as well as being a determined investigator on her own.  <br />There are some great scenes here, the chase across the floating logs, the shooting in the fog, and Pacino's great difficulty at adjusting to the midnight sun (to say the least).   It's a thriller but a bit different.
6305426651|4.0|Even though this movie is funny here and there, it is quite flat. The movie is meant to be a Comedy, but all it is really, is joking about the darkest, most terrible time in the 20th history. I still give it a 4 star though, because some parts of it where, I must say, hillarious. The end is a little sad, although not really. The charecters are quite intresting, but the story is pretty flat. It is funny, though, hillarious. So dont watch this movie if you expect to see this tear jerking, grim movie about World War 2.
B00004STPT|5.0|Enough cannot be said about this score. It will move you and haunt you forever. The incredible sense of emotion and depth is beautiful.<br />The first two tracks take you to the eerie and dark battlefields of Germania, and introduce you to Maximus' vision of home, with haunting strings and flutes, subtle spanish guitar, and the beautifully moving voice of Lisa Gerrard, we're taken from a dream to the harsh reality of war. Track 3 begins with building a cresendo that does not end for 5-6 minutes. At about 3.5 minutes into it, we hear a very cool method I like in music, when an instrument &quot;asks a question&quot; and another responds. Then the main theme kicks in full gear, and we hear it fully at about 6 minutes into it. Awesome french horns take over giving us the ride of Maximus, which ends again with the haunting voice of Lisa Gerrard. <br />We also get to hear some great Middle-Eastern style themes and some great themes for the power of the Roman Empire, however, I think the best part of this score is in tracks 13-17, as I find most people agree. #13 The Barbarian Horde is a great revisit to the heroic theme of Maximus as we first heard in #3 The Battle... Then #14 Am I Not Merciful (my fav) is so full of the sadness and hatred Commodus has for Maximus builds into a moving cresendo which ends in the last three tracks of Maximus' journey home. Beautiful strings and the voice of Lisa Gerrard take us into #17 Now We Are Free, a beautiful track of hope and freedom.<br />You must own this score, along with Volume 2, in which you get to hear the beautifully haunting Duduk of the North, and little ideas that never made it to the film, another must own. Hans Zimmer at his BEST!
B00005KB9W|5.0|Of all the Bob Marley albums I've heard, this is my favorite. I wore out the record but the CD is better because you can let it play straight through, and let me tell you, this thing cooks from beginning to end. Even the one slow song &quot;No Woman No Cry' cooks. Marley's urgent vocals are backed by one of the world's greatest reggae bands and complimented by the I Threes here. Buy this CD, clean your CD player's laser lens, put this on &amp; turn it up very loud so you can hear all the subtle melodic &amp; rythymic complexities happening behind the driving beat &amp; vocals. From &quot;Trenchtown Rock&quot; to &quot;Get Up Stand Up', you will be awestruck by this powerful and historic recording. If not, you're probably chronically un-hip. See my review of &quot;Toots and the Maytals Live' to further rock your world.
B0000214F0|5.0|Caligula is unique, in that it, for once, is a movie about decadent Rome, 37AD, when \\"anything goes\\" seemed to be the moral attitude, and showed that attitude, on the screen, with NOTHING implied. We see it all, from highly erotic, incredibly explicit ... scenes, to the aftermath of these unions, in the ... that are the spawn of the many incestuous relationships that were a reality back then. We witness the actual birth of the mad Caligula's daughter, and see him make love with his sister. We see horrible tortures, .... , rapes, sodomy, incest, and get to witness (up close and very personal) the orgies, that \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" was deathly terrified of showing. Remember the laughable screenplay, when the couples making love during the decadent costume party in the mansion were \\"stratigically\\" blocked out!!? I almost left the theatre. I DEFY any screenwriters out there to make a movie with even HALF of the intestinal fortitude of Caligula. Yes, incest, and .... are ...., vile and disgusting things. But in 37AD, they were prevalent. I am a fan of film, and it nauseates me when anything is \\"forbidden\\", or considered too contraversial for the screen. The film is powerful, and over the top with everything, and it works....Highly recommended, and should be seen uncut.
0783211856|5.0|I have not yet seen, a World War 2 movie as good and touching as this one. It is a remarkable peice, and everyone, should some day see it. It is a picture of the grim and realistic things that happened, but still keeping the beautiful and fragile aspects in touch. It truly should have gotten more awards, and should be though of as a classic. When you watch this movie, the length or color will not bother you. It's the story that is truly, the most remarkable thing ever put on a screen. It will leave you speechless. It is a remider of the era of darkness.
6302759110|4.0|Good movie. Keeps interested and is visually rich. I have the vhs version and the picture is very good with a sharp and colorful image. The sound is good also but the voices and mids sound somewhat muddy. Overall: VERY GOOD.
6303402348|5.0|I own this movie on video cassette and I still watch it from time to time. This is a true classic. In my opinion, it's Tom Hanks best movie ever! He even won the oscar for best actor. This is a very moving, heartwarming comedy-drama that takes you on an incredible adventure. Forrest Gump (Hanks) is often way too smart to be handicapped, and way too fast to be slow. How anybody could not like this movie is beyond me. This movie is an easy five stars. The acting, plot, script, characters, and everything is perfect and just plain enjoyable.
6305263248|5.0|This is an absolutely AWESOME movie!  I can't emphasize that enough - this is one of the best suspense thrillers you're likely to see anytime soon.  Though it was made in the 1990s, it recalls the glory days of the 1970s thrillers and is in fact directed by one of that genre's masters, John Frankenheimer.  He has made some excellent films, including the Manchurian Candidate and The French Connection II (often overshadowed by the original but showcasing an even better performance by Gene Hackman).<br />You know Ronin will be good with this director at the helm.  And check out the rest of the pedigree - Robert de Niro (Raging Bull, Godfather 2), Jean Reno (Leon - now this is also a great film but catch the European version if you can), Johnathan Pryce (Evita, Tomorrow Never Dies), and Sean Bean (superb as the tragic Boromir in Fellowship of the Ring).  With this cast and crew alone, the film will already be superb.  In a nutshell, the plot revolves around a planned heist to acquire a briefcase with some top secret...something or other inside.  But wait - there's more!  It's filled with clandestine meetings, shadowy locations, gun fights, betrayals, revenge, car chases, murder, etc.  <br />All good spy suspense thrillers are filmed in Europe, and this is no exception.  It takes advantage of many wonderful locales for its scenes.  The gun fights are expertly photographed and edited for maximal excitement and are quite brutal and unforgiving.  Yet the film always maintains an aura of realism about it - no Mission Impossible 2 gun ballets but just realistic and often painful and bloody gun fights.  No one is invulnerable to bullets, which makes the film quite gruesome at times.  Ironically, the most squeamish moment is not a gunfight but rather is an impromptu surgery when an injured character guides another character to help fish a bullet out of his body.<br />But wait, there's more!  You know how everyone says Steve McQueen's Bullitt has the best movie car chase ever?Well, it's darn good, but the first car chase in Ronin comes VERY close to matching the intensity, raw power, merciless editing, and excitement of Bullitt's chase.  Plus, the car chase starts and ends with a vicious gunfight.  Darn good stuff.  But WAIT - if you thought the first car chase was great, wait until you see the SECOND car chase, which gets my award for the BEST movie car chase of all time.  Basically, Robert de Niro is chasing someone else in a car, and they drive through heavily congested streets and tunnels and sidewalks and even in ONCOMING traffic.  The way it's filmed and edited makes the entire chase seem extremely realistic and DANGEROUS (unlike the bland Hollywood car chases you always see) and unsurpassed in its virtuosity.  By the second half of this masterpiece of a car chase, if your jaw hasn't dropped in amazement, you're probably blind.<br />But WAIT - there's more!  Katarina Witt, that's right, the Olympic champion, has nice role in this film as a Russian ice skating champ.  There's one simple scene when she steps out of a car, and she looks SO darling and beautiful your heart will melt.  But my favorite spot of the entire film comes in the middle of her skating program near the finale.  It's short, only a couple of seconds long, but it's SO unexpected during this graceful beautiful performance that it leaves quite an impact; I won't reveal it but you'll know it when you see it.<br />I could go on, but you get the picture.  FIVE STARS!  ABSOLUTELY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
0553296981|5.0|This is a remarkable book. It is moving, and funny, sad, and happy. And yes, this story is true. Her diary was found, abandoned, after she was taken to the Concentration Camp, by the Nazi's. The book was then discovered and published. Don't read this book if you are hoping to read about graphic things that are happning to the people aroung her. She dosn't talk about it. The story is even romantic, suspensful, and dramatic. It is every thing possible a book could be. It is a classic. It is a reminder. When you read it, you are reading the pages of a young girl, that poured her heart out on these pages, about her fear about being taken away. About her love and strength. You are reading living proof of the darkest era in the 20th century.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Lauryn Hill's debut album is magic. I enjoy listening to rap, hip hop and R'N'B, and when I heard a song of hers on the radio one day, i thought it was quite good, so I asked my uncle if I could borrow his CD. I had no idea what i was getting myself into. The CD sounded ok i guess, and i was playing Can't Take My Eyes Off You over and over, because it was the only song I knew and i didnt have the case. I started having an explore through the album, and was listening to Lost Ones. It got on my nerves, but then I listened to the words. It occured to me that Lauryn Hill wasnt like other poppy singers. Her songs were real, and they were in her mind, in her opinion. I appreciated the fact that she knew what she was singing about, and the fact that she was sharing the ups and downs of her life with us. It was then that i knew I had to get all the lyrics of her songs, and i would read them over and over, making sense of them. The songs became clear and relevant to me, i love her music now and i always will. It has a bass line to it that you can get hooked on, and unlike many other songs out there, it uses a technique to test your patience, how much of it can you handle. Other pop groups have songs that are just plain ordinary, it doesnt take a brain to listen to, but Hill's really do test the mind. Since her CD ive gotten 'The Score', 'The Carnival', 'Masquerade', 'II Sides 2 a Book', and have really become a fan of the Refugee camp. Thanx Lauryn, yo my hero babe!
B00003CXE7|4.0|The other reviews on this site list all of the admirable qualities of Gladiator. However, there is something that needs to be adressed. It's a good movie, but it has one flaw: its deadpan seriousness.<br />Gladiator pays homage to Spartacus, Ben-Hur: epics of Ancient Rome. However, it ignores that the other films aren't all serious. The tone of the other films has some lighthearted parts. However, this film just won't let up on the gloom.<br />I can apreicate that Maximus (Crowe) has lost everything he had, and so isn't inclined to be happy. But director Ridley Scott seems to think that this means the entire film should be sad. Humor and drama, as a rule, help each other thrive. <br />There are, to be fair, some lighter notes: two times the viewer chuckles. However, two is hardly enough: Hamlet, a dark play by any standards, has some great laughs of all stripes.<br />Gladiator is a good movie; it has a properly epic feel at times, and is quite stirring at times. But the overly depressing feel that covers the film keeps it from acheiving greatness.

B000068TPN|5.0|\\"We Were Soldiers\\" is one of the best vietnam movies I have ever seen. I congratulate all the cast and crew who participated in this film, Mel Gibson did a fantastic job, as usual. Sam Elliot was an excellent choice for Plumley. Ryan Hurst, awesome performance as Sgt. Savage, outstanding and such realism, \\"Remember the Titans\\" is also one of my favorites. I really enjoy your movies, you portray your character with such feeling, a unique quality. I was grateful to see that the wives and families of the soldiers were given so much attention, an important aspect to include, not only were these men soldiers they were husbands, fathers, and brothers. The wives who lose their husbands and the children who lose their fathers are very crucial to the true understanding of this particular war. Forget the negative comments made by those who do not understand that concept, war is terrifying to imagine let alone live through. I remember as a teenager when my brother left to fight in Vietnam, my mother and I would make up care packages for him; and I witnessed first hand my mother's courage. I have seen the vietnam wall with my brother recently and he still gets teary. The things these soldiers had to do to survive is unthinkable, and then to come home to protesters calling them horrible names and not even appreciateing the fact that they put their lives at stake for someone else. It is the soldier who gave with his life; gave you the freedom to protest. The movie is based on a true story, and it is an outstanding account of what really happened in Vietnam. The bayonet charge was outstanding I have only seen that done in two movies, \\"Gettysburg\\" and \\"We Were Soldiers\\" both based on true accounts. DEFINITELY NUMBER ONE, applause, encore.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is an incredible CD. Her voice is so wonderfully soothing and sexy and the lyrics are really great. I bought this CD because I heard \\"Don't Know Why\\" on the radio and I hoped the rest of the music was even half as good as that song. The entire CD is just fantastic! \\"Turn Me On\\" and \\"I've Got To See You Again\\" are just as good as \\"Don't Know Why\\".<br />Also, this is a good rush hour CD (e.g. road rage)...it is very calming. =)
0671617605|5.0|Anyone who has read this book or anything else about Anne Frank knows that she was one of the most courageous people to ever have lived. A thirteen-year-old girl who lived out the last two years of her life in hiding but still managed to stay cheerful, even though there were many people around and arguments over little things. Anybody that could spend two years locked in a confined space and not lose their mind is a very brilliant person indeed, and that Anne Frank was. This book tells of Anne Franks life, from her point of view, during the time she and her family, and freinds, lived in 'the secret annex.'
B00004RFFI|4.0|Ok, I'll tell you that this is a movie that's full of suspense and terrifying special effects of giant tornados wreaking mass havoc through middle America. That right there is pretty entertaining, and is about all you should expect from this movie - but you'll notice I gave it 4 stars.<br />I'm a *huge* tornado buff; I'm fascinated with and utterly terrified of them, so the special effects were enough to keep me gripping the theatre armrests the first time I saw it, and the couch the next several times. The plot...well, it's a love story/good v. evil/scientific competition/buddy movie...sort of. Phillip Seymour Hoffman probably has the most interesting role in the film, and pulls it off exceptionally well, The rest of the characters are largely forgettable, with lines of dialogue that, by and large, range from the bland to the outright annoying. Still, there are some genuinely funny moments, and a line here or there that made me laugh out loud.<br />Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton are two storm chasers in the midst of a divorce. They have gone their separate scientific ways, after almost completing a special set of instruments that will gather large amounts of data from inside the tornado itself. The movie is the story of how they get the instrument to work, their relationship as it develops again throughout the course of their travails, their sidekicks, and the &quot;bad&quot; scientist (Cary Elwes) trying to beat them to the punch with the device. The supporting cast are all able actors, and do a fine job with what's given to them.<br />The thing that really, *REALLY* bugs me, though, is the horrible science! This is, after all, a movie *about* *tornadoes* - it seems that they could have easily done a bit more research and gotten the majority of the details right. Ah well, c'est la vie, c'est la guerre. <br />The effects, though, are fantastic! ILM has once again worked their particular brand of wizardry, and for most of the time, the twisters look absolutely genuine.Fabulous. The suspense and the effects pretty much make the lack of plot and horrible science forgiveable, and we're left at the end with the satisfaction that comes from having sat through a horrifying vicarious experience.<br />Good stuff, overall.<br />The DVD extras aren't exceptional, but there's a good bit about &quot;the making of,&quot; and some commentary tracks.

B00006G8G1|5.0|After having seen all the VHS  concerts, it's great that MAIDEN have the &quot;ROCK IN RIO&quot; DVD with all new material. The material is mostly new with some classics. The editing is a bit frenetic, but since Harry Harris ( Bomber ) had 18 Cameras, this is fairly understandable; Steve Harris is responsible for most of the Visual product that Maiden has produced, and after the number of tapes he has produced, I can understand why he might want to experiment. If you really are keen on &quot;focusing&quot; on the band, then use the DVD  freeze frame. My opinion is that the editing is great, and suits the fast paced work of the show. It really showcases the band as it currently is on tour. With 3 guitarists, 1 bassist, 1 drummer, and 1 singer, I don't See how Steve Harris could have done the edit any other way. For me, the editing is not a failure... in fact I liked the clear shots of the guitar technique Gers, Smith and Murray use. A Pleasure to have this DVD now. Highly Recommended.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Here in the UK, John Cleese is regarded as a bit of a genius. With possibly the quickest wit and imaginitive writing skills as well as his unrivalled acting skills, this man is a heavywieght when it comes to light-hearted comedy.<br />Fawlty Towers is simply hilarious, and never disappoints, even when you've seen it so, so many times. I won't go on about individual gems, everyone else below has done a good Job with that.<BR>Just know that it is British Comedy at it's absolute best.<br />Some John Cleese movies include...<br />Clockwise - (this is the film that is mentioned by a reviewer below, but he couldn't remember it's name - well, here it is)<br />Monty Python (life of Brian, The Meaning Of Life, The Holy Grail)<br />A Fish Called Wonda (Absolutely brilliant - with Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Klien &amp; Michael Palin)<br />And of course, he's the new Gadget guy in the Bond films.<BR>If you ever see anything penned by, or starring Cleese, it's worth a look, and certainly a few of your American dollars!

B0000542D2|5.0|Buy it, you will love it. It's fun with great music
B00003CXXJ|4.0|The movie Shrek is certainly a winner, but some of the music selections could have been better in order to set a tone or the mood of certain scenes. For example; the raunchy rock music used when Shrek and Donkey first arrived at Farquaad's castle and do battle with his guards was bad and loud. However, the rock song \\"Im A Believer\\" at the end of the movie was appropriate for the scene. The music selected throughout the movie, with a few exceptions, was brilliant and moving and was appropriate for the scenes. The theme music at the begining of the movie which sports the DreamWorks logo is just epic, although the naration started just before the last few notes was somewhat disappointing because the music here is so beautiful and so moving that you'll want to hear every note.  The music used at the end of the dragon chase was excellent. The movie's theme of not judging a book by its cover, and the aspect of falling in true love, and the meaning of true friendship, are strong themes throughout the movie. The picture quality was first-rate. The attention to color, texture of objects, contrast, lighting, and shadow detail puts pressure on non-animated films to do as well. The shadow detail that could be seen in the dimly lighted Dragon's castle was great!<BR>A DVD dub with an audio over-ride on certain music selections will turn this movie from a four star status into a five star movie.<BR>DreamWorks: Very Good job!
B00006SFLV|4.0|MSCL will historically be one of the most important TV shows of the 90s (as will \\"Roseanne\\"), and represents the culture and experience of growing up in the years of grunge and Generation X. All the details of clothing, music, and issues are woven together perfectly, and the series does for 90s under-30somethings what \\"MASH\\" did for Vietnam. It's brief duration was a tragedy, but it's impact was tremendous, much like the whirlwind revolution of grunge and alternative music. <br />But one can't help but be a bit disappointed with the complete lack of extras in the set, especially with the knowledge that floating somewhere in production out there (a stalled production thanks to the bumbling and fishy, illegal acts of anotheruniverse.com) there is an entire DVD filled with extras... a bonus disc that was to be included with a special edition MSCL DVD set that came in a Lunchbox. <br />This set is nice, but let's hope and pray the Bonus Disc with tons of extras makes it out of production and will someday see the light of day. Something tells me there's about as much chance of that happening as a MSCL Movie, though.
0446310786|2.0|If you didn't read the back of the book you wouldn't know what it's main point was. Every book has it's problem. But this book didn't seem to have one. You know it's about a man who has to defend a Black man, Tom Robinson, for the accussation that he raped a white woman. But that just seems to be a part in the story.<BR>         I mean, the story dragged on and then suddenly this trial pops up. And that goes on for the rest of the story. At the end it's like the trial hardly happened. I've never read a book like this. For example, The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy was trying to get home right? Well Scout, one of the main characters, just sat on the sidelines the whole story and told what happened. She had no dramamtic effect on the book.<BR>         To like this book you have to have a particular taste for this odd book. I honestly don't see how it's such a great book. It's pointless, and useless. I'm sorry to say such things about such a classic book, but when I saw it I was expecting something more intresting. The book title hardly plays a role in the type of book it is. It is mentioned once in the book but only seems to relate to one small part, not the whole story.<BR>          I wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone I know. You just have to read it yourself to know what I mean.
B00003CY6M|3.0|This movie is a sopaipilla, light and fluffy with no filling.  It is founded on the premise that two star-fated lovers played by John Cusack and the beguiling (in a British sort of way) Kate Beckinsale, are destined to be together and leave fate to find it's way into each other arms.  When it comes down to it, the movie is trite, predictable, and wholly unoriginal.  Its saving grace is the chemistry created between Cusack and Beckinsale, Molly Shannon's quirky-ness, and some verbal ranting between Cusack and his long-time sidekick Jeremy Piven.<br />Everything about the relationship set-up between Cusack and Beckinsale is annoyingly narrowly missed opportunities.  They pick the same floors on separate elevators but never meet, they pass each other in the city time and time again, by the predictable conclusion you are left not caring too much if they come together or not.  There are some beautiful cinematic shots of New York and San Francisco.  John Corbett does an annoyingly soft turn at new age musician Lars Hammond making you wish for the days of Chris in the morning on KBER from the Northern Exposure days.<br />For a date movie, this one was pretty hard to enjoy for both my date/wife and myself.  Go get \\"Family Man\\" or \\"Say Anything\\" if you want to get all googly-eyed and weepy with your mate.  Skip this one though unless you are a died-in-the-wool die-hard die-cast into oblivion romantic.

B00005JL78|5.0|...Spielberg proves that he is a master filmmaker with something that one must consider a modern masterpiece.  It will stand in film history as a timecapsule of one of this era's great director's bleek vision of the near future -- a very real, dark, and believable vision that will make you cringe at the thought of how close it really is.
0385505833|5.0|This is a very fast read. You will not want to put it down.  Read this book in November and you will look at Christmas differrent. I alwasy thought Christmas was a little too comercial. And have always thought of skipping Christmas. But friends and family will not let me.<br />In this book a couple, The Kranks, decide to skip Christmas and go on a trip instead. Sounds good to me, but the neighbors cannot believe anyone would actually skip Christmas. The story allows itself to send the readers a message about the true meaning of holidays and friendships.
B00006IUL7|3.0|Nolan has in fact proven himself as a wonderful director and story teller, but I would never use this film to showcase his talents. Insomnia does have strong points, from its beautiful cinimatography to its incredible acting from such veterans as Pacino and Williams and even newbie Swank. The film has a promising premise, a killer on the lam and a detective who is slowly fading into oblivion due to sleepless nights. The setting is perfect for such a mystery, a film noir in the forever seeming daylight, but the plots strengths end there. What seems to be a very deep murder mystery eventually floats to the shallow end of the lake as the film drags on to its un satisfying end. I wanted to love this film, but got bored instead.......
B000002MJC|5.0|This album is somewhat of a rarity in my collection of metal, classic rock, and electronica. Nevertheless, it is among my favorites. The most stunning aspect of this music is its darkness, and the beauty that lies within it. I am a big fan of dark music, and here DM make some of the best I've ever heard. The songwriting is very emotional, displaying desperation, desire, bitterness, and anger among others. The lyrics fit seamlessly into the mood of the album. While past compositions have sounded a bit &quot;cheesy&quot; at times, DM take their electronics seriously this time. I might even dare to say that &quot;Rush&quot; (originally my favorite) was a major reason for my subsequent interest in &quot;techno&quot;. Other excellent tunes include &quot;walking in my shoes&quot;, &quot;mercy in you&quot;, &quot;get right with me&quot;, and currently my favorite, &quot;higher love&quot;. These songs definitely speak as a whole, though. This is an album that should be listened to from start to finish. Over the many years that I've owned this cd, it's never really occured to me that it fits into a neat little genre. As others have suggested, DM draw from a variety of influences here. I like to call it just plain good music, because that's the kind that's usually the best. Explore the dark beauty of &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot;.
B00000JPHG|5.0|This is the best Chucky movie ever!  Just when you think that chucky died he's back! Charles Lee Ray is still looking for a new body, but this time the plot is a little bit more involved.  This is also the funniest Chucky movie, because it shows Chucky on his honeymoon!  But, I can't say anymore for those of you who haven't seen the movie yet. One of my favorite characters in the movie is the &quot;psycho&quot; girl who has a hudge collection of dolls in her trailer.   She is too funny! I got a kick out of the way that she framed pictures of dolls as if they were people!  I really thought that it was wacked the way she sewed Chucky's head back together!  I mean, who would do that sort of thing with a doll's head, who murdered people??  Who would be at the right place at the right time to even find the head?  In this movie we are introduced to a new character,  &quot;the girl doll&quot;.  Who would've thought that Chucky would have a friend? If you like the chucky movies, you will love Bride of Chucky!

B00001NFCY|5.0|In a word: awesome. They have oan incredible amount of raw talent. Here's a track by track review.    1.Are You Ready?=4/5-A great rock song. Good start for the disc.    2.What If=5/5-Arguably the best track on the disc(in my taste). Great lyrics.    3.Beautiful=3/5-OK. Pretty much a poem in song.    4.Say I=5/5-Awesome cristian lyrics. Great music too. Good for head bangin'.    5.Wrong Way=3/5-Pretty good. Interesting lyrics.    6.Faceless Man=3/5-A softer song than the first five. Creepy lyrics, about maybe a ghost? Or...God...maybe? I dunno.    7.Never Die=4/5-Your classic song about wanting to stay young and...well..never die. Only withh creepier music.    8.With Arms Wide Open=5/5-Need I say anything about this song about the arrival of Scott Stapp's son? I thought not.    9.Higher=5/5-Another exremely popular song. Lyrics about not wanting to wake up from wonderful dreams. The other best song on the disc.    10.Wash Away Those Years=5/5-An incredibly awesome song with truely amazing lyrics. You decide what you want them to be about.    11.Inside Us All=4/5-A very good uplifting song. The main lyric line tells you what the whole tune is about: &amp;quot;there's a peace inside us all&amp;quot;.    BUY THIS CD!!!

B000022TSY|5.0|The scenery alone is enough to send chills down your spine. Add to that the killer soundtrack and Jack Nicholson's star making (and in my opinion, his best) performance and you've got yourself one hell of a film. Easy Rider (Directed by Dennis Hopper) is the story of two hippie bikers who take a trip on their motorcycles down to the Mardi-Gras festival in New Orleans. Along the way they stopped at a hippie commune, end up in a parade, and spend the night in jail before finally making it to Mardi-Gras. Where they proceed to have themselves a good old time with two [women] while taking acid.<br />The big three things that make this movie special are the scenery (photographed to perfection, by Laslo Kovack) the music. Which just plain rocks and Jack Nicholson's performance. Nothing against Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper's performance but Nicholson steals every scene he's in. This movie is also a fasinating look at the 60's counterculture. Lots of drugs, great music, killer movie. Enjoy.
6303334598|4.0|There are romantic comedies that you remember even years later for their wit, grace, and matchless chemistry of the leads.  IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT comes to mind.  Then there are those that are of a lesser order that you may remember vaguely a plot but not much else.  IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU is of this latter type.  This is not to say that director Andrew Bergman did not manage to convey several heart-warming complexities that inevitably result when unexpected riches collide with everyday life.<br />Nicholas Cage plays police officer Charley Lang, who does not have enough money for a tip for waitress Yvonne (Bridget Fonda), but he does, however, have a Lotto ticket that he promises to split with her should he win.  Naturally, he does win, and it is his winning of four million dollars that changes the tone from that of light comedy to the more bitter world of sleaze and greed.  Charley's wife, Muriel (Rosie Perez) epitomizes the grasping, totally self-absorbed woman whose true feelings for Charley are dwarfed by her need to have it all.  There are some unnerving scenes of greed versus honesty played out in court that seem to validate the widespread belief that whenever huge sums of money are at stake, the participants had better get the details in writing.  There are two areas of the film that do not ring true.  The first is the unlikely pairing of the heartless Muriel with the heartfelt Charley.  Muriel comes off as a female Murdstone from Dickens' DAVID COPPERFIELD.  Her antagonism towards Charley is unfathomable.  Neither is her lack of acumen at hooking up with a man, following her divorce, who is even more of a golddigger than she is.  The second is the saccharine ending that purports to show that the collective hearts of the Big Apple are big enough to force an ending that is sappy enough to let the audience sigh at a most unlikely resolution.  IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU proves that though love may enable vast chasms to be crossed, human beings are more likely to retain that love if they remember why they fell in love in the first place.
B00005GL0P|3.0|'Rubber Soul' is an important album, because it marked the first step towards the more mature, reflective Beatles. But compared to 'Revolver', 'Sgt.Pepper's' and 'White Album' - the quality of the songs on Rubber Soul are not as good. Of course songs like 'The Word', 'Michelle' or 'Norwegian Wood' are superb but the rest is simply boring and sometimes really embarrasing ('Nowhere Man' or 'What goes on'). Don't get me wrong, the Beatles are the best but 'Rubber Soul' was just the beginning of something much bigger to come up...
B00006F7S4|3.0|These are very good songs to be sure. They may even deserve more than 3 stars, but I rated according to how much I like the CD. Basically, it's not my cup of tea. Give me MIDNITE VULTURES almost any day over this. Even when I'm depressed cause it'll cheer me up. If I want to listen to Gordon Lightfoot (which he sounds like quite a bit here - sometimes a bit too much like him if you know what I mean) or, say, America then I'll just listen to those artists. <br />Like I said, these are good songs, but it's a bit hard to take a whole album of melancholy mellowness. And the songs are somewhat overrated; nothing here is as good as some of his previous mellow stuff like \\"Nobody's Fault But My Own\\" from MUTATIONS. Highlights include \\"The Golden Age,\\" \\"End of the Day\\" (Gordon?) and \\"Little One.\\" <br />Once again, Beck raids the record bins for different sounds, such as 70's style orchestration. But many of the \\"special effects\\" don't really fit in and seem superfluous, unlike the way he brilliantly blended sounds on his previous albums. Maybe Nigel Godrich said, \\"Dude! we've got to make this at least somewhat cool sounding!\\"<br />I certainly hope Beck has exorcized the heartache from the breakup he had with his girlfriend which inspired this melancholy album. When I think of lines from his past albums like, \\"I want to get with you/And your sister/I think her name's Debra\\" (from \\"Debra\\" on MIDNIGHT VULTURES), I wonder if they had anything to do with the breakup. I think some of his song lyrics would definitely make your average girlfriend uneasy. Oh, well. Here's hoping Beck gets back in party mode for his next album or at least livens up a bit!
0316666343|1.0|As many others have pointed out, this is a book that had great promise but didn't live up to its promise.  Much of the writing is lovely, but there are serious problems with plotting and narration.  Susie's heaven is too cute, her voice too precocious.  Many of the chapters have no real reason for being there. Much, much too often it is very obvious it is Sebold narrating and not Susie.  The beginning chapters are compelling, and Susie's degredation is undeniably powerful; but the story, as handled by Sebold, cannot sustain itself all those pages.  I would disagree with a previous reviewer in only one respect.  No creative writing teacher, none I know anyway, would have told Sebold to write that way.  The novel is a very disappointing read, and I cannot understand why it was so well reviewed in the media.
B00005NGAL|5.0|This DVD is awesome! We saw the &quot;musical&quot; at Biloxi &amp; thought &quot;OK&quot; then heard Orlando Pops CD &amp; there is just no comparison to Elaine Paige &amp; the other &quot;Ultimate&quot; cast members. None. Buy it!
B00005O3VC|4.0|There are people (such as my mom) who aren't impressed by this movie (or any other Python stuff) because they just don't get it. Then they go and try to make us look ridiculous because we find it so funny.<br />Well excuse us for not having a typical, American sense of humor - a movie doesn't have to have raunchy penis jokes or ridiculous one-liner 'punches' to be humorous! Granted, the movie does exihibit plenty of idiocy in itself, it is a different kind of idiocy. The Pythons' lunatic-like randomisity is what endears the fans.<br />This kind of humor is what my mom calls \\"dry humor\\". Well it is, for those of you out there who are too lazy to THINK. Comedy requiring thought - what a CONCEPT, huh?<br />Adam Sandler, Eddie Murphy, and all those others - mere cannon fodder to the Pythons! I'm not saying they aren't funny, mind you! I think Eddie Murphy is definitely hilarious! And Adam Sandler is..... .... well, his supporting cast does a better job than he does. If it wasn't for them, he wouldn't be quite as funny in movies (his CDs are a great though!).<br />My point is that they can't match up to the Pythons' thought patterns. They made comedy by touching nerves - sensitive areas that you find appalling at first, then somehow, you find them funny. Remember Life of Brian and Meaning of Life? Those were railed upon by being insensitive and overly nasty to the christian community. That's the humor in it! They make fun of true-to-life events!<br />The only thing that gave this movie four stars from me was the little problem with the subtitles. It could have been betterly handled.
B000066NW0|5.0|AVRIL LAVIGNE IS A SUPER STAR! Being from Canada makes her voice sound uniqe and absouloutly singer material. Her tune is awsome and her voice is too! It doesn't matter what she wears because she is famous for her voice. I highly recomend this CD!
B000002U9W|5.0|The self-titled suite is far and away the best Pink Floyd song.  It's not as classical as some reviewers insist.  The song is great for a number of reasons:<br />1. The dueling of Rick Wright's keyboard and Roger Waters' bass (with a cello or viola in the background) about three minutes into the song.<br />2. David Gilmour's liquidy solo that immediately follows.<br />3. Wright's organ accompanied by a choir.<br />4. Waters' bass that leads into...<br />5. Gilmour's best-ever guitar work, from 10:50 to 12:50.<br />&quot;If&quot; is a solid song by Roger Waters.  Not as good as his solo-compositions from Dark Side, Wish You Were Here, or Anumals, but perhaps his best up to that point.<br />&quot;Summer '69&quot; is in my opinion the second best song on the album.  It ranks with &quot;Remember A Day&quot; and &quot;The Great Gig In The Sky&quot; as teh best Rick Wright song.  It takes a while to warm up to the airy vocals, but once you do you'll love this song.  The same is true for the lyrics.  The first time I heard them, I wanted  to laugh at their stupidity.  I actually like them now.  The strengths of the song are...<br />1. Wright's piano.<br />2. The horns.<br />3. Gilmour's acoustic guitar slowing down about at 3:50 and then picking up a beautiful, steady rythym.<br />4. Wright singing &quot;Goodbye to you...&quot;<br />&quot;Fat Old Sun&quot; was my favorite of the middle three songs on first listen.  However, it doesn't gain much on repeated listens.  It's a simple, calm, immediately-pleasing acoustic song.<br />&quot;Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast&quot; is not a good song.  I could only stand playing it a few times.  I would have given it more chances but the sounds of Alan eating were utterly repulsive.<br />My only complaint with the album is that David Gilmour's guitar, after being excellent on the first track, totally fizzles out and is mediocre and uninspired on the rest of the album.<br />Atom Heart Mother is my favorite Pink Floyd album along with Wish You Were Here.  It's a lot like Meddle in that it has a side-long song and then shorter tracks.  The major difference is that Atom Heart Mother is better..

B00005JKDR|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. When I watched it in the theaters, I knew I had to add this to my DVD collection! Monsters, Inc. is a great family movie full of emotions: it's adorable, funny, sad, makes tears well up, gets you mad and makes you laugh out loud. You'll fall in love with the characters! Fun movie for children, as well as adults to enjoy! Best Disney flick I've seen in a loooong time.
0515123447|3.0|As mentioned in other reviews some of the coincidences that make up the core of the story are a little hard to swallow.  But it does little to hurt what is otherwise a very intriguing story.  Jack Reacher is a pleasant departure from the usual action hero. He does what he must to get the job done without wrestling his conscience.  When he dispatches a bad guy,and they're very bad, there is no clever little quip, no dramatic showdown. He has no qualms about shooting first without warning or throwing the first punch.  Jack is a very interesting character and I look forward to reading more of his adventures.<br />  There are a few minor details that I hope get cleaned up in future stories.  jack just wanders the country with only the clothes on his back, no shaving kit, no change of socks and underwear, no deodorant.  The notion of the wandering loner is romantic but in reading about Jack I began to think that he must reek!  Obviously he doesn't as Officer Roscoe will attest but for the sake of nit picky jerks like me... give the guy a knapsack or something!  It won't slow him down any.
B000002UJQ|5.0|i regret not getting this album sooner. ever since i bought it 2 years ago, i have listened to it at least once a day. i never get tired of it, in fact, my appreciation of it seems to grow with every listen. this, in my opinion, is the greatest album ever (with pet sounds coming in at a close second). the album is best listened to as a whole, however, there are no weak tracks. the experience of listening to the entire album is indescribable, and uncomparable. i tend to develop a new favorite track every few months. for a while it has been &quot;exit music&quot;... but recently i have developed an obsession with &quot;the tourist&quot;. something about thom singing 'hey man, slow down' is wonderful while driving at night. <br />if you havent heard this album then you havent heard real music. if you have, and you don't like it, try it again.. listen to it all the way through, it will grow on you.... and if you still don't like it, i feel sorry for you. you are missing out on one of the most beautiful experiences in the world.
0784011214|5.0|When Released in 1985, Stallone was fast becoming an action star, & like Chuck Norris' \\"Missing in Action\\", a year earlier, viewers wanted to see Hollywood win in Vietnam, this one begins some time after \\"First Blood\\" where Rambo is in prison for his rampage in \\"First Blood\\", he is met by Col.Trautman(Richard Crenna) who offers him a mission in Vietnam that involves possible POW's, if successful, he might receive a presidential pardon for his actions in the first movie, he accepts & is soon on his way to complete the mission, the government director of the mission tells him to only photograph prisoners if any, but Rambo is content for rescue instead & in the process is caught only because of government red tape, in which the director orders the rescue helicopter back, leaving Rambo just a few feet behind, Trautman is enraged & realizes that the director is a beaurocrat only interested in pleasing the public's inquiry about POW's not existing, later we meet Russian Col. Pedovsky(Stephen Berkoff of \\"Beverly Hills Cop\\") who interrogates Rambo is a torturous way with electricity, demanding answers, of course this was during the cold war, in the Reagan era, & Stallone embodies Rambo as a tortured soul who is scarred by the war, only his contact(Julia Nickson) a vietnamese woman who is his guide & likely a deserter, helps him escape, only after he is made by Pedovsky to contact his government in which he tells the director Murdock, \\"I am coming to get you\\", as Rambo makes his escape, he is pursued by the vietnamese & the russians, he becomes a one-man army that systematically wipes out everyone in his path, & even rescues the POW's after acquiring a survellence helicopter, in which he is then pursued by Pedovsky in a more advanced helicopter which results in an arial chase where Rambo's chopper is damaged & lands giving him the oppurtunity to pull the element of suprise, which he does on Pedovsky that involves a rocket launcher, once free of pursuit, he goes to his base,upon arrival he crash lands the chopper & goes after Murdock, who by this point is sweating with nervous antisipation, once confronted by Rambo, he backtracks & tries desperately to convince him he had nothing to do with it,Rambo tells him to not let others die in camps & to find the rest, this was a crowd pleaser in 1985, second only to \\"Back to the Future\\" as the year's biggest movie, in which audiences loved because of its underlining political tones about possible POW's & our governments refusal to acknowledge it, Norris' \\"MIA\\" played on the same themes, as did Oliver Stone's \\"Platoon\\" which showed the horrors of Vietnam, & our ability to not want to accept defeat over there, but do, In 1988, Stallone returned as Rambo in \\"Rambo III\\" while not as emotional as this one, it definately played on the political themes of the time, & was less popular, but good nonetheless, but this one was emotional,it was said that Reagan liked this one,the DVD is one of the best transfers I have seen, the picture is clear as clear can be, & has a documentary that showcases the war & what it meant to so many, great DVD, Highly Recommended!
B00004ZD69|5.0|Although Deep Space Nine serves no relevence to this cd I thought that it was an appropriate title.  With that being said, I just want to say that this is the sort of music that I have been looking for.  When I first put it in, and the soaring drums and orchestrations kicked in I knew that this was good.  The cd has many great emotions in it, and all are done very well.  They can make the simplist sounding noise and have it go on and on and on... and make it be worth while.  This is both very simplistic and complex, done very well.  I suggest you pick this cd up if you like Confederate Rock
0783225970|5.0|Al Pacino is not your average everyday actor, shy in interviews & nervous at awards show, especially his acceptance speech in 1993 for his best actor win for \\"Scent of a Woman\\", but when he is in character, he is in top form, he totally embodies the character of Tony Montana, a character with a cult following that even Pacino cringes about when asked about its following,although he did say it has been his favorite character to ever play, in this he is Montana, a cuban refugee who comes to America when Castro ousted many refugees in 1980, he is one of the many refugees dropped off in Miami, who is given a green card in exchange for a favor that involves killing one of Castro's ousted leaders, once a citizen, he & his friend & partner(Steven Baur) begin to build a new life, mainly a minimum wage job in a local resturaunt stand, they yearn for the good life & are soon introduced to Omar(F.Murray Abraham) who offers them lots of money for a drug drop which they agree to,only to be double-crossed by the seller who uses a chainsaw to make his point by killing one of his other friends, which soon prompts Baur & another to retaliate in a rescue attempt in which Tony ends up killing the seller in a revenge-style killing, he then takes the money & drugs to the big man, not Omar, the big man is Frank(Robert Loggia)who takes Montana under his wing as a potential successor, here Montana meets Elvira(Michelle Pfrieffer) who Tony developes a fixation on, Tony soon meets with their supplier in South America who soon has Omar assasinated because he is an informant, Tony & Alex(Paul Shenar)the supplier soon click, & Frank in Miami feeling threatened soon has a hit out on Tony, a hit that goes wrong in which Tony retaliates in a neat fashion, once confronted, Frank is soon killed in retaliation as is a corrupt Narcotics Detective(Harris Yulan)who earlier tells Tony he will bust if not paid off,after this Tony soon heads Frank's operation & marries Elvira, & quickly rises to the top ofthe drug trade, most notably cocaine, but his new found wealth is compromised as he is soon busted by other Narcotic Detectives in which he is facing jail time,via a video camera which his lawyer cannot get him out of, however his supplier Alex agrees to help him out with his influence in Washington & in the Justice System in exchange for a favor that involves Tony assasinating a International U.N.spy who is bound & determined to stop the drug trade, at a summit in NY, Tony agrees but retracts when he learns that the wife & children are involved in the assassination, this begins his downfall as the supplier now with tremendous heat upon him orders a hit on Montana & his whole Empire, & succeeds in a rather intense conclusion in which Tony takes on an army of assassins, & takes out half before being taken out himself, this movie shows the dynamics of the dangerous world of drug lords, where you can have it all & lose it all if you are not careful, one neat scene is when Tony tells patrons at a fancy restuarant that they are the bad people & that they need people like him to scapegoat, as he says \\"say goodnight to the bad guy\\" revealing the hypotcritsy of rich people & their attempt to point fingers at his kind,although out of print, Universal is planning a re-release next year in theatres in honor of its 20th Anniversary, as well as a 2-disc set on DVD which is said to be much better than its initial DVD release now out of print, definately a underrated gangster movie that reveals the Miami drug trade & its reality, Tony Montana is definately the Anti-Hero you love to root for, & Pacino gives his best performance of his career here!!! Mary Elizabeth Monstantonio(The Abyss, Color of Money)is also here as Tony's sister who Tony is vey protective of & it too leads to his downfall, although 3 hours long, you never notice the time!!
B0000648WZ|5.0|This movie is probably the best \\"war sci-fi\\" flick I've ever seen, and I've seen them all.<br />Technical Evaluation:  The DVD video is crisp and vivid, the special effects are truly first-rate, the audio is good, and there are lots of nice special features, including deleted scenes (why were these scenes deleted?  They would have been helpful to the movie.)<br />The movie is based upon Robert Heinlein's classic \\"Starship Troopers\\" novel which won the Hugo Award in 1959.  Unfortunately, the movie unnecessarily departs from the novel to a significant degree.  The central political message of the novel (which is preserved in the movie) was the notion that only those who had served a term in the armed forces would be permitted to vote, the theory being that such persons had shown a higher sense of civic duty and responsibility.  Not a popular idea in our society with its emphasis on entitlement, but intriguing to some.  The director and others have labelled this idea as \\"fascist.\\"  Robert Heinlein, who was no fascist, didn't think so.<br />The story line in the movie is excellent, for the very simple reason that there **is** a story line, and the movie keeps moving right along without any long, boring, pointless interludes that some directors (mostly European ones) seem to cherish.  The acting is not first-rate, but it is not bad.  All of the characters are easy on the eyes, and actually do a good job.  The movie is fast-paced and keeps your interest all the way through.<br />Minor quibbles.  The weapons used by the Mobile Infantry seemed unrealistic--a trooper had to keep shooting at one bug for about 20 seconds to kill it.  Surely by then they would have had lasers or something.  That's what the book had.  The \\"Zander\\" character seemed unnecessary, but didn't really detract from the movie.  Since asteroids from one solar system can't be used to attack another, this is an irritant.  Why not have Bug spaceships attacking earth like in the book?  Why do directors change these things?  These are minor quibbles though.<br />This flick is simply a classic SF war movie, and deserved to do better in the theaters than it actually did.  The special effects are so good that you truly feel as though you are in the twenty-second century with Earth locked in a life-or-death battle with an enemy species.  The off-world scenes really do make you feel like you are seeing scenes on another planet or in space.  This flick is well worth buying, watching, and keeping in one's DVD collection.se things?

B00005J73X|4.0|When I saw this at the music store I knew I had to buy it.  Like all Bon Jovi fans, I've been waiting to see a Bon Jovi live album, and this one definitely delivers!  I'll admit to you that I wasn't sure about this one at first.  But don't let that fool you, because almost every song is a winner.  However, I have a few complaints.  First, I think it should have been a two disc set because a lot of great songs were omitted.  As well, as another reviewer stated, the song &quot;I Don't Like Mondays&quot; featuring Bob Geldof should have been left off.  A good song, but really doesn't make sense on a Bon Jovi live album.  Despite these and other flaws I won't get into, I still enjoy ONE WILD NIGHT LIVE and am glad it is a part of my collection.  NOTE to JON BON JOVI &amp; COMPANY: consider putting together a two-disc edition of this album, which in addition to the songs already on the album, include some of the songs that are featured on &quot;THE CRUSH TOUR&quot; DVD as well as other recordings from the 1980's!  You already have a guaranteed sale of at least one copy!  SO, LET'S ROCK &amp; ROLL!
0553573403|5.0|I've read a few reviews comparing this series to Jordan, Goodkind and Brooks. To be quite honest, there really is no comparison. I've read and enjoyed books from all these authors, but quite frankly GRR Martin is in a class of his own. Martin has really raised the bar as to what an epic fantasy series should be.<br /><br />One point, don't let the size of the books lead you into believing that this is just another doorstopper series. As you come to the end of one of these books you'll be wishing it was longer! Really!

We attempted to use the Bene Gesserit to force kids away from drinking fountains, turn our eyes the deep blue of the spice addiction, and were constantly discussing what it would be like to be on a planet where it never rains(partially since we live in Oregon, where it seems like it's ALWAYS raining).<BR>Dune is complex, a skillfully created tapestry, each thread a different character or situation to follow to the end, not just chopped off abruptly at some point like in poorly written books or ideas.

B00000GAIW|5.0|\\"Aqualung\\" is certainly the rawest of Jethro Tull's albums, as far from the artistic pretensions of \\"Thick as a Brick\\" and \\"Passion Play\\" as you can get in terms of their albums.  This might have something to do with the album's mission statement, which is printed in old fashioned type on the linear notes: \\"In the beginning Man created God; and in the image of Man created he him....But as all these things did come to pass, the Spirit that did cause man to create his God lived on with all men: even within Aqualung.  And man saw it not.  But for Christ's sake he'd better start looking.\\"  Ironically, this is one of the few Jethro Tull albums where the lyrics are not printed despite the fact this is arguably the album where the lyrics mattereth the most.<br />The first \\"side\\" of the album, entitled \\"Aqualung\\" after the first and title track, offers nothing overt other than the idea of dismissing organized religion as \\"salvation &agrave; la mode and a cup of tea.\\"  However, the second side, \\"My God,\\" makes its argument in earnest from the opening verse: \\"People - what have you done/locked Him in His golden cage/Made Him bend to your religion/Him resurrected from the grave.\\"  The Church of England is explicitly condemned for having supplanted the authenticity of the Christian religion with plastic crucifixes.  \\"Hymn 43\\" continues this line of argument by suggesting that: \\"If Jesus saves - well, He'd better save Himself from the gory glory seekers who use His name in death.\\"  \\"Slipstream\\" offers a metaphorical look at sinners trying to save themselves at the last moment: \\"And you press on God's waiter your last dime/as he hands you the bill.\\"  That \\"Slipstream\\" comes right before \\"Locomotive Breath\\" makes sense when you look at the latter's lyrics in light of the former.<br />But Ian Anderson's diatribe against the organized religion of his country does not extend to God, as is amply proven by the concluding song, \\"Wind Up.\\"  To underscore the importance of what is being sung at this point, the music tends to get out of the way of the lyrics, especially the final lines: \\"I don't believe you/you had the whole damn thing all wrong/He's not the kind you have to wind up on Sundays.\\"  When the teachings of the church consist of nothing more than \\"half-assed smiles and the book of rules,\\" this necessitates a more personal dialogue with God.  In Anderson's world God replies with a firm answer.  When Anderson declares \\"I'd rather look around me - compose a better song/`cos that's the honest measure of my worth,\\" he is staking a claim to more piety and sanctity than the edifices he is indicting.<br />The second side of \\"Aqualung\\" aspires to being much more than mere rock `n' roll.  The message is simplistic, but still compelling.  \\"Aqualung\\" represents Ian Anderson speaking in relatively clear words; from here on the will cloak his lyrics in metaphors and his own brand of mysticism.  But for me it is ultimately the clarity of the lyrics and the intended message that makes this the strongest of Jethro Tull's albums.  There are certainly more pleasing melodies down the road, but that does nothing to diminish the raw power of this effort.at this point, the music tends to get out of the way of the lyrics, especially the final lines: \\"I don't believe you/you had the whole damn thing all wrong/He's not the kind you have to wind up on Sundays.\\"  When the teachings of the church consist of nothing more than \\"half-assed smiles and the book of rules,\\" this necessitates a more personal dialogue with God.

B00005RYLE|5.0|\\"The Book of the Dead\\" should find it's way into every home in America 'nuff said.  Why do I make such a bold statement?  Is it because \\"The Evil Dead\\" is perhaps the largest cult phenomena movie ever made with the possible exeption of \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show?\\" Is it because of all the versians of this movie ever released (15+) this is by far the greatest in terms of  quality and bonus features?  Because the widescreen anamorphic picure and newly remastered soundtrack are superior over any previous attempts?  Or is it simply because the packaging is so friggin' COOL!?!?!  Whatever the reason, this debut for the talented director Sam Raimi and the high spirited dynamic screen presence that is Bruce Campbell is simply a wonder to behold.  Now, just to clarify something once and for all, \\"The Evil Dead\\" is NOT for all tastes, and features some extremely gory shots that may leave you a bit uneasy after eating a cup of yogurt or other soft substance of pus-like consistancy.  And you may want to send the kids out of the room during the scene when the woman is attacked... by trees(you'll see). But it is what it is,whether it be a great movie of classic stature, a gorgeous new widescreen transfer, glorious remastered sound, hefty extras, or the greatest packaging ever made for a DVD, this is just a must own in EVERY way!!!
0486266885|5.0|\\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is assured a place in the history of horror fiction because it the literary classic that represents the archetype of the werewolf (the human with the hiding inside).  Along with Mary Wollstonecraft's \\"Frankenstein\\" (the Thing Without a Name) and Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" (the Vampire) Robert Louis Stevenson's novella is part of the gothic foundation of the modern horror story.  All have in common the fact that they promise to tell a story that might best be left untold, which, of course, is exactly the sort of story we want to hear.<br />Given that Stevenson was writing when the genre of horror fiction was not recognized as such, it is surprising that \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is cast in the form of a mystery novel.  Stevenson invites his readers to try and get ahead of the story, to put the clues together and come to the conclusion.  Today it is nearly impossible to pick up this story and not know the \\"secret,\\" but if you think back to the late 19th-century when this story was written you can get a sense for how Stevenson used the biases and limitations of his readers to his advantage in keeping them from what we might consider to be an obvious conclusion.<br />More importantly, Stevenson is writing several decades before the writings of Sigmund Freud revolutionized the whole idea of human psychology.  Yet we can certainly find evidence of the conscious and subconscious mind of which Freud would write.  Stevenson reinforces this metaphor with the block of buildings that divides this particular part of London, with one side representing the civilized world of a respected physician and the other side the squalor of the world inhabited by an inhuman creature who gives in to his every earthly desire.  The novella also speaks to the topic of evolution, with Hyde being described as \\"ape-like,\\" reinforcing the idea that our most human attributes remove us ever further from the category of mere animal.<br />Of the three classic horror novels, \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is the most accessible.  Not only because of its shorter length, but also because its evil is more realistic, even in terms of our imagination.  We might be unable to reanimate the dead or to become the walking dead, but we can certainly relate to the idea of unleashing the beast buried with us.  Even if we could not, we can recognize the \\"werewolf\\" in the real world in the form of serial killers who try to show a civilized face to us in public.  This is not to say that the novella is simplistic, for Stevenson offers a sophisticated narrative.  If this is one of those literary you have never read because you already know the story, then you should take out an evening to sit down and finally get around to reading it.Of the three classic horror novels, \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" is the most accessible.

0671775308|1.0|I did not like this book at all. I am a high school senior, and I read it for a project in my economics class. Therefore, a lot of the advice and examples didn't relate to me at all. <br />The book was too factual for me. It also used termonology that I wasn't familiar with. So it was hard to follow and understand. Even though I read the whole thing, I don't really have a good idea what it was about, and I can't recall certain things because it was so boring it went in and then came right back out. It took me too long to read this book because I kept trying to understand it better, which didn't happen, and it was so boring I didn't want to read it. <br />It also sounds like it will be interesting from the title, since it says 'suprising secrets of America's wealthy' you think it will be telling you interesting things about millionaires, but to this book, interesting things are &quot;Sharon has an annual realized income that is equivalent to 59.5% of her total net worth.....&quot;<br />It's not interesting at all. It even has charts and tables in it, that I couldn't understand. It just doesn't seem like a book when it has tables and charts in it. It also had simulated dialouges between two millionaires. It's got too much and in an unorganized way. You don't really know what they're trying to tell you!<br />I wouldn't read it again for a million dollars.

He kills the opening to the song, &quot;Little Dolls&quot;.  The bass playing is nothing to write home of either.  Ozzy, you need to be fair.  If you're going to remove Bob Daisely's bass lines you also need to remove his lyrics and write your own.  See how far that gets you.
0671027573|5.0|Okay, just so you 'get' my title, the first time I read this book, I was laughing and sighing so much, I didn't pay attention and fell and broke my foot.  The moral: Linda Howard books are best read on the couch with a cup of tea or cocoa.  Since I had plenty of time to do that with my foot in a cast, I read this book from cover to cover three times.  I really enjoyed the chemistry between Jaine and her friends.  It was really nice that they were not all twenty-something white women in happy marriages that were trying to help the only unmarried girl in the group.  Instead, they are a facinating blend of ages, marital statuses (sp?), and they even had different racial backgrounds.  The chemistry between Jaine and Sam was electric to me.  Just the way they worked up to their first time together waas enough to turn my cheeks red, and set my heart a-pounding.  So, remember, stay on the couch, enjoy the book, and no-one gets hurt!
6305508550|5.0|I don't remember hearing about Office Space when it was in the theatres, and I don't know how well it did at the box office.  All I know is I am SO glad that I was introduced to the greatness that is Office Space!  My boyfriend relates to the tech office setting, but I have never been in the characters' situation, and I still love this movie; it is for anyone and everyone!  The characters are hilarious and over-the-top, yet still relatable.  Some of the characters:  the hilariously irritating boss Lumbergh, the white gangsta-rap fan Michael Bolton (who hates sharing his name with the infamous pop singer), the jaded protaganist Peter, and the mumbling and secretly plotting Milton.  The contrast between the techie office setting and the gangsta-rap soundtrack is hilarious.  You should buy the movie if only for the great scene of Peter and his friends demolishing a hated office copier.  Everyone should see this movie- many, many times!
B00000IN5G|5.0|I have to say that I'm really impressed by this album. When I first heard it, I couldn't believe how much I really like it. These guys are a unique type of death metal. You can definately hear the power metal and black metal sounds on this one. Some bands try way too hard to sound unique (like Cynic, who is a horrible mixture of death metal, jazz and techno), but not Children Of Bodom. These guys do it great. Even the synth isn't too bad considering synth can sometimes ruin an album. I'll admit, not everyone will like this album. For those who do like it, I give you credit for knowing when something is actually good and talented.
B000022TSY|5.0|Greatest Road Movie Ever. A True Classic<BR>Reviewer: A viewer from Minneapolis, Minnesota United States<BR>The scenery alone is enough to send chills down your spine. Add to that the killer soundtrack and Jack Nicholson's star making (and in my opinion, his best) performance and you've got yourself one hell of a film. Easy Rider (Directed by Dennis Hopper) is the story of two hippie bikers who take a trip on their motorcycles down to the Mardi-Gras festival in New Orleans. Along the way they stopped at a hippie commune, end up in a parade, and spend the night in jail before finally making it to Mardi-Gras. Where they proceed to have themselves a good old time ...<BR>The big three things that make this movie special are the scenery (photographed to perfection, by Laslo Kovack) the music. Which just plain rocks and Jack Nicholson's performance. Nothing against Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper's performance but Nicholson steals every scene he's in. This movie is also a fasinating look at the 60's counterculture. Lots of ... great music, killer movie. Enjoy.
1556154844|4.0|This is an outstandingly good book about software construction techniques that lead to a sound, robust product. It starts with simple things like naming conventions, function layout and commenting methods, but covers the whole software development cycle of design, programming and quality assurance. Although it gives plenty of source code examples in several different programming languages, these are always short and easy to follow even for 'language foreigners'. Source code examples are only used to illustrate more general, important points, rather than specific implementation details. The author is careful not to force his personal style on you - which would be rather foolish considering the many 'religious' issues covered (naming conventions anyone? ;) ) - but presents his opinions supported by sound arguments that'll make even skeptics reconsider. The text is an easy read compared to more technical books and is covered with lots of very amusing short stories that highlight key points. <BR>This book will be a great aid in keeping your and your coworkers' mental health while programming in a team under a merciless deadline.<BR>If you are at all serious about programming - buy this book!
B0000542D2|4.0|This DVD looks like it was produced in such a way that would not make Beatles fans sorry for what they'd already bought. Do you have &quot;The Making of a Hard Day's Night&quot;? Good thing, because that documentary has a lot more interesting stuff than you will find in the extras, here. Do you already have the laserdisc edition of the movie, released in 1987 by Criterion Collection? Good for you, again - that edition had all the songs in STEREO and included &quot;The Running and Jumping and Standing Still Movie&quot; as a bonus.<br />The DVD format, with its menu features, has created a new standard for supplementary material. Instead of one carefully edited documentary that flows smoothly from start to finish, you get several interviews that you can watch in any order. Some of them are quite interesting, in fact. OF COURSE this is a mandatory item for any Beatles collector. Come to think of it, perhaps they did the right thing by not overlapping with previously released stuff. I just hope &quot;The Making of A Hard Day's Night&quot; is still in print, for the sake of those who hadn't bought it. As for the laserdisc, sorry, it's a dead format, anyway.

This is cleverly written by William Hjortsberg (who wrote-the novel:Angel Heart). This has great Make-Up effects by Rob Bottin (The Thing, Total Recall, Fight Club), Excellent Production Design by Leslie Dilley and Assheton Gordon and Good looking cinematography by Alex Thomson (Labyrinth, Excalibur, Alien 3). Well, the Overseas and American Version has two different music score by Jerry Goldsmith (European Version) and Tangerine Dream (American Version) and of course-the editing is different also. DVD's is a 2 Disc Set for the European Version with Never Seen Before Footage with an interesting commentary track by the Director:Scott and the Original american release. Both has strong anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer. Director's Cut has an impressive Digitally Remastered Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound (also in DTS and Dolby Surround) and American Version is in Dolby Surround. DVD extras are great, including:An great documentary on the memories of the film with the filmmakers and cast, an lost never seen before deleted scene runs 10 mins, the fairie dance scene using the Original Audio with Storyboards and Photos. Isolate Music Score from Tangerine Dream and more. Some might dislike the original ending on the director's cut but it's much more closer and inventive ending, he wanted to have. I do like american version has an good (If uneven in someways) ending and we do see Darkness at the beginning (That explain why Scott prefer is Original Cut, which he's right) and even after he dies. Director's Cut is much more better and original with Goldsmith great score in it. It's almost perfect movie but there's one Character named Blix just disappears in the middle half of the movie (Even in the Director's Cut, we never know, what happen to Blix), Payten did actually dubbed Bennett's voice in the movie. Still, it's a fine, extremely entertaining movie. J-D-C Scope (Joe Dunton Cameras). Grade:A- (For the Director's Cut) and Grade:B+ (For the American Cut).
B00005JKES|4.0|I used to watch Twin Peaks all the time. Every week, I set aside everything else for one hour of this compelling murder mystery. And to be honest, I can hardly remember a thing about this series. So when the DVD of season one was released, my curiosity and desire for some early 90's nostalgia made this an impulse buy. First, let me gripe about how the 90-minute pilot is not on the DVD. Otherwise, I was rather satisfied with this engrossing first season of Twin Peaks, which is as atmospheric and twist-filled as I recalled, if not quite as solid in terms of pacing.<br />Anybody who's familiar with the series will know that the plot focuses on the murder of Laura Palmer and FBI agent Dale Cooper (Kyle Machlachlan), an intriguing, mildly eccentric man determined to find her killer. From what I've seen in season one, each episode introduces new characters and interesting subplots that add twist upon twist upon twist. If it weren't so addictive, I'd have a headache.<br />Let's take a brief look at the cast. There's Sheriff Harry S. Truman (Michael Ontkean), the lovely waitress Shelly (Madchen Amick, looking just as beautiful as ever), Lara Flynn Boyle as Laura's best friend, Shery Lee as Laura's identical cousin, and...oh, geez, just watch the series for yourself. I'm having a hard time going through this whole cast, suffice to say that just about everyone is interesting and developed fairly well, which I assume would make the revelation of the killer that much more effective (and yes, I do know the identity of the killer). <br />As created by David Lynch, Twin Peaks is sometimes VERY Lynchian, which proves to have its good and bad points. What works: Lynch proves capable of writing quirky characters worthy of screen time, he knows how to keep a seemingly story moving forward while building in complexity, and he's got a great sense of atmosphere and small town mentality. He also teamed up with Angelo Badalamenti, who composes a truly great score, making this one of the few shows I'll actually watch through the opening credits just to listen to the music. What doesn't work: he tries way too damn hard to make each character quirky, he adds his own oddities that don't always gel well with the material (the dancing midget, in particular), and in terms of pacing, the series (at first, at least), doesn't bounce back and forth between subplots quite as well as I would have liked. But, no doubt, by episode 7, I was hooked. <br />There are a few other annoying things here and there. For one, the Laura Palmer look-a-like is too convenient for the plot. Obviously, Shery Lee wanted at least some screen time beyond being a mere cadaver. Some of the characters act against better judgment, such as the decision to shorten the autopsy on Laura Palmer for her funeral. Sure, I know it's out of respect and all, but given more time for thorough examination, I'm sure more clues would have been uncovered. By far the most annoying aspect is the log lady, who I'm sure must have seemed quirkily and darkly humorous on paper, but doesn't play well into the story.<br />The cast is mostly really good, with Machlachlan doing a surprisingly fine job as Agent Dale Cooper. Michael Ontkean is also solid as the sheriff, and yeah, these two have a pretty good working chemistry. Whatever happened to Ontkean, anyway? I'm surprised he hasn't become a bigger star these days. I'd find it a little repetitive to mention the rest of the cast, suffice to say most everyone is at least decent in their roles. I suspect the second season will reveal secrets about many of these characters (I'm most curious about Joan Chen, who looks like she's got something up her sleeve). I'm also pretty curious about how Cooper's relationship with Audrey (Sherilyn Fenn) will turn out. And hey, I don' think I've ever seen a television series with this many attractive actresses (Madchen Amick, who's easily the most beautiful of everyone here, Lara Flynn Boyle, Sheryl Lee, Joan Chen, and Sherilyn Fenn).<br />Twin Peaks has quite a few stumbles here and there, often succumbing to silliness and often working too hard at being odd and quirky rather than trying to tie everything together coherently (though, don't get me wrong, I realize all issues will be resolved later). But this is still a very addictive television series, mostly well-paced, and with appealing characters and settings that make me look forward to the next season once it, too, arrives on DVD.<BR>*** 1/2 out of *****
B00006FIAZ|5.0|this is an amazing mix of black elements and elemants from melodic death. they retain the violence and power of metal well being melodic. there are three brilliant acoustic tracks mixed in throughout the brutality adding to the atmosphere. this cd is lyrically  accomplished as well as musically. all 4 of these guys no how to play their instruments. i recomend to buy this cd before \\"storm of the lights bain\\"(there other cd) because this ones more brutal and youll be able to appreciate both cds even more this way.
0684800713|4.0|This is first of Hemingway's most famous novels (i.e. A Farewell to Arms, For Whom the Bell Tolls, The Old Man and the Sea), published when he was twenty-seven years old and marked by his plain, direct diction and an overshadowing cynicism.<br />At the simplest level, this is a story of twenty- and thirty-something Brits and Americans existing in post-WWI Europe; it's told through the eyes of Jake Barnes, a newspaperman left impotent by a war wound.  Barnes and his comrades, including the \\"damned good looking\\" Lady Brett Ashley, make their way from Paris to Pamplona and partake of the week-long bullfighting fiesta.  Hemingway reveals his own passion for bullfighting in his smooth description of the matadors' artistry and in the distinguishing of those whose work is mere illusion from those who work with true grace and courage.<br />Throughout the story, moments of violence burst through the affected nonchalance of Jake's circle.  Emotions run high as the men strive for Brett's affections, win them . . . lose them just as quickly.  One of the most enticing anti-heroines in literature, Brett is an alcoholic and (possible) nymphomaniac, as much at the mercy of her whims as those around her.  She is described as \\"Circe\\" because she turns the men around her to pigs; a group of Spanish dancers form a circle around her but prevent her from dancing--she must be still, worshipped as an idol.  She is a remarkable character, adored and yet worthy of our pity: only an impotent man is safe with her; only a healthy man can satisfy her cravings.<br />A fascinating achievement in twentieth century writing, TSAR has aged in places, where much of the characters' slang is unfamiliar.  Nonetheless, it reads quickly and often easily, providing a good introduction to Hemingway's work and a disturbingly vivid picture of the lost generation.
006092988X|5.0|I am a student of Betty Smith's and have read all the reviews on this site. Many of you loved this book and described it as a classic. Unfortunately, as great as it is, it is not considered a classic academically. It is not canonized, it is not often read in high school and college classes. Do a web search on Betty Smith and her name will rarely link with any websites. That is where you come in. If you truly love her works, spread the news. This author, who wrote 4 novels and over 70 plays, is quickly becoming forgotten. It is time for a revival.

B00006IU73|5.0|Porcupine Tree have really outdone themselves with \\"In Absentia,\\" a collection of 12 devastatingly brilliant tracks, which feel more like rich works of profound art than songs. Though it is their major label debut, not an ounce of artistic inventiveness has been sacrificed on the road to bigger and better things (as well as bigger and better paychecks perhaps.)<br />Steven Wilson, the group's eccentric frontman and head songwriter, always a master of contrast manages to juxtapose the blistering, head-bang worthy riffing of \\"Blackest Eyes\\" with the predominately acoustic and melancholy \\"Trains.\\" He also manages to conjure up some deliciously atmospheric soundscapes in such tracks as \\"Lips of Ashes\\" and \\".3\\" while not forgetting to kick it into high gear with the maniacally metallic guitar work in \\"Wedding Nails,\\" and the twisted, fractured psychosis of \\"The Creator Has Master Tape.\\"<br />It seems like over the past few years, the band has grown increasingly dark, both lyrically and musically. The only repreive from the unreleting (though paradoxically euphoric) gloom is heard in the bittersweet closer, \\"Collapse the Light Into Earth,\\" and the middle segment of \\"Blackest Eyes\\" (which is sandwiched by a pummeling barrage of harder-than-hard metal.) But despite the lyrical darkness of the somewhat industrial \\"Strip the Soul\\" and \\"Prodigal,\\" Wilson still manages to offer us a biting attack on the insipid state of popular music, in \\"The Sound of Musak,\\" which ironically features the catchiest chorus of all the songs on the record.<br />And so, here is one of those few magical bands who manage to walk the fine line between commercial accessibilty and artistic inventiveness, without falling to the ground on one side. \\"In Absentia\\" is a true artistic triumph, and if the dreams of hopeful fans have any element of prophecy in them, then we can expect Porcupine Tree to win over legions of fans and become a name well-known in the near future.
0375701427|5.0|As Mrs Seinfield says of her son \\"How can you not love him?\\" the reader may say as well of the protagonist of AMERICAN PASTORAL- Seymour Irving Levov. And yet long before the end we may also conclude that \\"the Swede\\" as he is affectionately called, is an unsympathetic and hollow soul. To me this book is about America. Where has she been? Where is she now? What will she become? The book also ends with questions and to some readers these questions may remain unanswered and may even be unanswerable. And yet, Mr Roth, at least to my mind, does provide some answers, at least by implication.<br />The central question asked is this:  Isn't it enough for the hero Seymour Irving Levov just to BE and to take in his life what he finds before him?<br />What does Seymour take?  In a nutshell, the bounty of being born in America at a particular time.  He takes what his father had built(a successful glove factory); he takes as his wife Miss New Jersey 1949; he takes a heritage home and a parcel of richly productive land on which to raise his family.  He leaves school at 14 in order to take up this bounty.<br />In the novel as a representative of the past, the hero's father rants about American having strayed from her \\"path\\", whilst his idealistic daughter, representative of the future, acts to give reality to her beliefs by disowning her mother and her family and becoming a \\"terrorist\\" and murderer.<br />Maybe it isn't enough to take what's offered.  Maybe there is an obligation on the Swede, and by extension on all those who enjoy the bounty.  How, when, where and to whom these obligations are directed is a larger question.<br />AMERICAN PASTORAL may be described as a novel of ideas, but to me the characters are so vivid and memorable, and the narrative so strong, that such a description amounts to a disservice. In addition, the information provided on the glove making process I found fascinating and memorable and an important element in establishing the growth of America as an industrial powerhouse. The decline of the industry too, and the whims of fashion, the effect of Jacqui Kennedy on that industry ( Camelot indeed)all helped to complete the beguiling background against which the lives of the characters are played out.<br />I found this novel a profoundly interesting and moral examination of matters crucial to the survival of those things for which America professes to stand tall - freedom, equality before the law, justice - as well as a moving creation of a range of characters. A must read.powerhouse.

B00006FDCJ|5.0|Let me begin by acknowledging that I am not a huge Clint Eastwood fan.  I have liked some of his movies but have nenver made a habit of having to check out the latest Eastwood thriller at the multiplex.  Given that, it is even more remarkable that I really loved this DVD.  Unforgiven is a great film that deserved its Best Picture Oscar. Eastwood, Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman are all terrific in this movie about facing up to your past and the cost of violence to society.  Hackman won the Oscar for best Supporting Actor and watching the movie again just confirms what a great choice that was.  Everything about this movie is top notch- the acting, the writing, Eastood's direction.  This is the best western of the past twenty years and one of the best ten ever made.  The movie shines on this disc, it was a great transfer. The extras on this two disc set are delightful.  There is a classic Maverick episode featuring a very young Eastwood, along with some documentries and some other wonderful extras.  This belongs on any movie buff's shelf and would make a great gift for anyone who is aEastwood fan, a fan of westerns, or a fan of the movies.

B00006F7S4|5.0|Seems to be a lot of strong opinions about this album; folks who use Beck as background party music seem to think he's &quot;lost his groove&quot;, and others say this is his first real album.<br />Personally, I think the most suprising thing about it is how honest it is. For the first time, Beck isn't hiding his feelings behind donkey-brays and goofy samples; he's expressing himself fearlessly, and the result is shockingly beautiful after the funk-comedy of &quot;Midnite Vultures&quot;. It sounds, more than anything, like a lost Nick Drake album, or maybe the sorrowful folk album John Lennon never made. In any case, it's shimmering and gorgeous and deeply sorrowful, and the best thing Beck's ever done.

0767903862|5.0|First and foremost, this is a fun book to read. It is funny, informative, insightful, and yet sincere enough that you can forgive him longing for a sunset over the Pacific which is, of course, impossible in New South Wales; ah well ...<br /><br />I knew nothing about Bill Bryson until a friend of mine loaned me this book. My friend assures me that all of Bryson's writing is of this caliber and just as much fun. It seems likely that this is true.<br /><br />From 1973-75 I was fortunate enough to live in Queensland and this book resonates well with my experiences from so long ago, if nicely updated. Australians (Aussies - pronounced Auzzies - NOT! with an s sound) are simply wonderful people. I am glad the Bryson points out their openness and friendly exuberance. He was fortunate enough to travel throughout the continent while I lived in a few towns up and down the coast of a really delightful place.<br /><br />Queenslanders are usually and falsely cast as backward or \\"mad as cut snakes\\" (as they are here). Queensland itself is often referred to in a patronizing way, for example, being given the nickname \\"Cinderella state\\". But my experience of it was not like that at all. Yes, the more rural places lacked the infrastructure of urban places (as do all rural spaces - it is sort of the definition isn't it?) and in 1973 Brisbane was still a smallish city and felt it. But when I was able to travel there in 1995 on business, Brisbane had become a gleaming and very modern city. And in New South Wales, Sydney is utterly beautiful with delights all around you.<br /><br />Anyway, Bryson gives you the flavor of many places in this vast continent (it is bigger than the 48 states of the US). He specializes in the out of the way, but manages to find things that really do tie into the history and fabric of the place. Bryson has a real talent for this and makes it all seem easy and light, but it is hard work to write like that.<br /><br />I recommend this book highly to everyone who is thinking of visiting this wonderful place and to everyone who wishes they could get there. Heck, even to those who know nothing of the place and think they might like to learn something more than kangaroos and koalas!<br /><br />It is a breezy read that you can get through rather quickly while learning more than you suspect.

0316666343|5.0|I loved this book!  The point of view was unique and the storyline was well-paced.  It was a touching story of the aftermath of a murder.  The best thing, I think, is that while the story takes place in \\"heaven,\\" there are no religious overtones.  It was a gripping novel, not because the reader needs to figure out who the murderer was, but because the reader gets caught up in the quest to find him and bring him to justice.  A truly wonderful novel!
B000002UAO|4.0|This a great and very understated album. Opening with the great Drive My Car, the album just moves gracefully from tune to tune with the Beatles showing signs of what was to come with Revolver. However, I think this represents the more honest effort of the two, illustrating the charm, cheekiness, and thoughtfulness that the Beatles brought so well to their music. My favorites are Drive My Car, Norwegian Wood, The Word, and Michelle, but it's all good. It really needs no flourishes in reviewing it, because it's a no frills album and that's why Rubber Soul is so cool. I rank it #2 behind my personal favorite (frills excellently done, thank you ;)) Abbey Road.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is my absolute favorite CD. I love listenin too it and making other people listen to it! It is soothing and relaxing. Whenever i am upset or overwhelmed i just turn on this CD.

B000002UAU|3.0|Sgt. Pepper's is a good album, IMO. But it's not Abbey Road, Rubber Soul, or Revolver. And as far as it being a concept album, sure it starts out that way and kind of ends that way, but not really. I will say that I love the title tracks (both the opening and reprise) as they are great fun with Sir Paul leading the way. With a Little Help From My Friends has grown on me (I just love Ringo's voice;)I can't explain it). I also love the underappreciated gem When I'm Sixty Four, a great throwback to the 20s and 30s. Lastly, I have a thorough respect for A Day in the Life, an unusual but interesting composition.<br />The rest of the album, however, is kind of unmemorable to me in comparison to these great songs. I think the whole \\"concept\\" deal overhyped it and kind of hurts the album in a way. It seems more like a loosely conceptual idea, but the middle sort of shies away from the theme and then comes back (somewhat awkwardly) with the reprise. Then it messes the whole thing up with A Day in the Life (good song, strange placement as far as a concept goes). Abbey Road is actually a much stronger example in concept, flow, and cohesiveness than Sgt. Pepper's.

B00006F7S4|5.0|Beck has put together an album that is brilliant, even more so, since it's so cryptically beautiful.

B000001FYL|1.0|Since it's been three years since someone else pointed this out, I think it's time to try and set the record straight. The \\"soundtrack\\" album is one of the all-time great music-from-and-inspired-by ripoffs; only two of Jon Bon Jovi's 10 songs on it are in the movie (and then only over the end credits, and not even in their entirety), and Alan Silvestri - who wrote most of the music that's actually IN the movie - is fobbed off with one token track (\\"Guano City\\") lasting all of 59 seconds, and thus raising the bar for soundtrack album ripoffs to a height that to this day has (thankfully) never been reached. (\\"XXX,\\" which managed to find no room for Randy Edelman's score over a DOUBLE-disc set, will have a score album from good old reliable Varese Sarabande.) Score fans, avoid this...

B000059H99|5.0|I came into this movie expecting a typical, narrow, but well-told story of one man's training and his battle against all odds to triumph in boxing, as it is advertised. However, I was surprised that 85% of this movie focuses on the human story, not a story of trying to be the best boxer. Instead it is a story of people, and how they deal with their problems, and how they try to change. This only makes the ending far more meaningful.<br />So it all builds up the same theme, but much more effectively than relying purely on shallow feel-goodism. At the same time, I've never seen a film that has focused so well around the theme of struggle, and striving to achieve one's goals against all odds. Surely a breakthrough film.

Other albums have better musicianship, more creativity, more genius, are treated with greater respect, and reverred as the &quot;Greatest&quot;. Unless you were there you cannot begin to fathom the importance of this album, these twelve silly love songs, this 30 minutes of innocence. Put quite simply this album was the salvation of rock and roll.
0812550706|5.0|As a rule, I don't read sci-fi.  As my sister-in-law recommended this book, I thought I'd try it.  I LOVED it.  Its theme is remarkably close to that of my favorite book: The_Power_of_One.  It's an underdog story.  While the action was OK, I really liked the non-battleroom game sequences, which follow you to the end and introduce the most fascinating part of the story: the Speaker for the Dead.  I haven't read the sequels yet, but I hope they live up to Ender's_Game.<br />As for the appropriateness of the book for young kids, I think it's a middle school read, despite 1 or 2 very tame swear words.  It's definitely no worse than the average PG movie.<br />The most amazing parts of the story are the refereneces to modern day inovations, like instant messaging and bulletin boards.  It represents what I see as the strength of sci-fi: the ability to derive the future from our current technology.

B000008COG|4.0|This is a strong album by AC/DC, released originally in 1988. The playing is tight and focused, the drumming by Simon Philips is ok.<br />The trouble is Brian Johnson's vocals. They are beginning to lose it's distinctive growl and become a sort of muffled sound..<br />The best songs are RUFF STUFF,NICK OF TIME, TWO'S UP and, in genereal, all of them have quality. If they just had a better singer at this point.... Brian Johnson served them perfectly in BACK IN BLACK and FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK, but after that his voice was gone.
B00006F7S4|4.0|Beck's Sea Change opens with an enticing invitation of optimistic assurance, \\"Put your hands on the wheel, let the golden age begin.\\"  If you have read or heard anything about Beck's recent offering, it is probably that it is nothing like what you are expecting, that the artist's ironic days of sonic mischief represented by albums, Mellowgold and Odelay have gone, well...'Andale'.  The truth is out, and the new album is no fun at all, yet countless members of the rock press can be seen scrambling to be among those in right enough mind to affix their most prestigious stamping of approval.<br />This is partly because one of Sea Change's victories is that it validates claims printed about Beck since he emerged with his song 'Loser' eight years ago, that under the pistache of layered experiments, genre-hopping and sardonic lyrics, is a brilliant, charmingly insecure singer-songwriter.  This record marks the day the egg is hatched. The next 'next Dylan' has come of age and the 'I told you so's' are becoming even more abundant than highlights on this landmark recording.<br />Famed for his work with Radiohead on their masterpiece, OK Computer, Nigel Godrich is back behind the soundboards doing production as he did for Beck's on Mutations. Godrich's string arrangements are mostly successful adding color, however Beck is an artist known for subtlety while Nigel is more given to the dramatic.  At times, like on second track 'Paper Tiger', it is as if Godrich looks to challenge the fact this is Beck's record, similar to how William Orbit has commandeered the last two Madonna projects.  On \\"Paper Tiger\\", Godrich scores swirls of symphonic embellishment that are excessive at best.  'Paper Tiger' isn't the most tuneful track on the record but it is strong enough to stand without such indulgences.  Instead, the effort suggests the song require them.  Even if argued \\"Paper Tiger\\" does need something, this effort is overexerted.<br />This is forgiven though after the first moments of 'Guess I'm Doing Fine'. With Nigel taking a break, Beck's song is allowed to soar.  Lamenting where Beck finds himself after a breakup, he sings \\"It's only lies that I'm living / it's only tears that I'm crying / it's only you that I'm losing / Guess I'm doing fine.\\" Apathetic and filled with despair, a glimmer of hope is elusive but unmistakably present.<br />On \\"Lonesome Tears\\", Beck and Godrich work perfectly in concert with one another. The strings from before build more gradually and a wurlitzer adds a hazy quality common in feel with Air's record, Moon Safari.  When Beck finishes he yields to Godrich building a crescendo to a scale the word 'epic' does not sufficiently illustrate.  Then at the height of drama, the moment is swallowed into silence.<br />Now gratified, Nigel behaves for three consecutive songs.  Left to stand on there own, \\"Lost Cause\\", \\"End Of The Day\\" and \\"It's All In Your Mind\\" each succeed to form the heart of Sea Change.  Listening to them will force any reasonable skeptic to concede that Beck will be with us for a long time.<br />The only true misstep on Sea Change, \\"Round The Bend\\", broods perilously close to Nick Drake's \\"River Man\\" complete with atmospheric accompaniment similar to Joe Boyd's work with the ill-fated, 70's singer-songwriter. Beck isn't truly redeemed for this posturing until \\"Sunday Sun\\". Here, Beck calls from a distance as if he senses he's left the listener in the wake of his progression from trickster geek to pained troubadour, \\"There's no other ending / Sunday Sun / Yesterday is ending / Sunday Sun\\".  The song also builds emotion to allow \\"Little One\\" to serve as the disc's triumphant climax and for the stripped-down, \\"Side Of The Road\\" to be it's effective coda.<br />Like punk, the singer-songwriter tradition is accessable to most anyone with a guitar.  For this same reason, it is most difficult establish any lasting relevance within it.  Hacks are plentiful.  Artists influenced by, but not derivative of, the greats that precede them are a difficult find.  The most important development on Sea Change is that Beck has asserted a unique voice.  He has pulled from all the right titans, Dylan among them, sounding like no one but himself. Even more thrilling are the achievements that promise to follow, that if you leave Sea Change with one surety, it is that Beck's The Golden Age has indeed, only begun.greats that precede them are a difficult find.

B000069HKH|4.0|People like Michael Beyer below are probably the kind of person who has enormous prejudice against older people. Instead of admiring Bruce even more for being able to sell out 20000-seat arenas even being 55, no. What does he do? He rips scorn upon Bruce. Go figure why...<br />I agree that THE RISING is being advertised as a tribute to the fallen of September 11, but, once you read the lyrics, they are not very clever or innovative or sending a clear message at all.<br />The songs are not his best, but not his worst either and, anyway, I prefer to have a new Bruce album featuring the E-Street band than having another solo Bruce album!<br />I also think that fifteen songs was too much. THere was no need for the album to span whole 77 minutes.
B000002L75|4.0|It's a good album.  I'll give it that.  Every song has something in itself that makes them good songs.  They all seem paradoxical to be place side-by-side, though.  Maybe that's how Depeche Mode is.  They've always been some what enigmatic.<br />Themes on this CD range from romance to bondage to parodying sappy love songs to social justice.  Every song on this CD is good.  I just question the fact that all these songs are so different from each other.
B00003CXE7|3.0|I like this movie, for an epic battle flick it is pretty good although it is a bit long and the battle scenes-though good-left me a bit cold. Everything battle-wise looks old-hat after Kenneth Branaugh's HENRY V and Gibson's BRAVEHEART. GLADIATOR is an enjoyable film with great acting (of course) by Crowe, who carries the film with his singularly massive screen presence.  The supporting cast is good, but on occasion, unremarkable.  I have seen the film three times and remember little about most of the characters.  The locations are great and the script is good if forgettable.  This probably should NOT have won best picture, but you already knew that.  Even so, it remains one of the better films of the year. <br />The DVD is packed and gets a five star rating. I don't know what else could have been added to it. The picture and sound quality are great though not to reference standards. The second disc is packed with material which you can read about if you so choose.  If you are one of the three people on earth who have not seen this film give it a try.  It never achieves its goals, but it aims high.
B000001Y5D|3.0|Let's face it--&quot;What's Up&quot; was their only hit but it's worth buying this CD for it.  (Also, it wasn't released as a single).  The song deserves to be heard.  Linda Perry's musical genius flowed through the song and captured every person's desire for emancipation from this patriarchically-dominating world.  <br />The rest of the album isn't as ambitious as &quot;What's Up&quot; but this is the only reason I bought this CD.
B00000DG1R|4.0|Ah, my favorite DD tunes-takes me back to adolesence. DD owned much of the radio in the early to mid 80's. This is a pretty solid collection of their best plus a few newer tunes that are really good. If you don't have any of their stuff this is a good place to start. Otherwise forget it. I hate remixes and this has a good number of them tacked onto the end...
B000002MUW|5.0|A different Madonna album but aren't they all?  Madonna explores her soulful side on this album and it works!  No need for vocal acrobatics like other singers trying to prove something.  She lets the music take care of that and sings with her heart.  <br />This is a more mellow Madonna.  Her vulnerability peeks out in songs like &quot;Inside of Me&quot; and &quot;Love Tried to Welcome Me.&quot;  However, she turns that around and sticks it into the faces of her critic with her song &quot;Human Nature.&quot;<br />The hits &quot;Secret&quot; and &quot;Take a Bow&quot; make this album worth the value.  The other songs on this album are great too.  It brings me back memories of some of my fondest times: college.  I hope this album can bring back memories for you or even create new memories for you to look back upon.
B000002UB6|5.0|This is the Beatles at their most organic, their most 'real' performances.  Un-deified.  I for one think it is great that after some more polished albums the boys got back to raw roots.  The songwriting is great.  &quot;Two Of Us&quot;, &quot;Dig A Pony&quot;, &quot;Across The Universe&quot;, and &quot;I Me Mine&quot; -what a way to start an album!  Not to mention &quot;Get Back&quot;, &quot;I've Got a Feeling&quot;, &quot;The Long &amp; Winding Road&quot;, and the marvelous title track.  I have no beefs of any consequence with this release.  Great stuff.  If you have not yet seen the film from which the album came, do yourself a favor and rent it.  Fascinating.<br />Essential Fab.
B000002GVZ|5.0|Anticipation.  You're So Vain.  Songs that defined an era.  Carly really knew how to write a song.  She didn't belabor them.  They were just thoughts that flowed from her heart to her mouth.  She had a way of taking an irreverent moment and making a song out of it.  The universal appeal of her songs really fit our lives and the daily activities (and inactivities) we experience.<br />Jilted by a lover?  \\"You're So Vain\\" is an in-your-face song that has been rumored to be about her failed relationship with Warren beatty.  Hmmm...true or not, it is a guilty pleasure for us to sing it at a karaoke bar while thinking about an ex that we still can't stand.  Ever have any of those?  Sure you have!  Even your current, ahem, partner coulde the target of that song.<br />Every song on thisD really tugs at the heart.  \\"I Haven't Got Time For the Pain,\\" \\"That's they I've Always Heard It Shoulde,\\" and many more.<br />This is songwriting heaven!
B000051VWW|3.0|As another reviewer put it this is not her best, but its still better than most of the other junk out there.  For those looking for a triumphantly powerful follow-up to her amazing 1992 LOVE DELUXE, you may be *slightly* disappointed.  Some of the tunes here (specifically #'s 5, 6, 10 and 11) are dull.  I usually skip them.  On the positive side, the first four tracks sound great.  I like how &quot;Somebody Already Broke My Heart&quot; incorporates that slight wavering keyboard that I somehow can't stand when I hear it in the ubiquitous rap song, and makes it work.  Somehow it doesn't sound 'played' here.  &quot;Flow&quot; harkens back to her previous release with its MASSIVE bass.  A great song.  Also of note, &quot;Every Word&quot; is very catchy as is &quot;King of Sorrow&quot;.  These songs make the album worth checking out.  As usual, the production on this album is immaculate-the mix is awesome.
B000001GPX|5.0|La mejor grabacin de la 5a de Beethoven que existe. Que fuerza y energa!
0783117523|5.0|By the end of this movie I was sobbing like a baby. They took the stereotypical glamourous life-style, painted it with reality and showed the true story of a beautiful woman who's life was cut short tragically by an addiction to heroin. Angelina Jolie did a fabulous job (as always) playing Gia, and this is definitely my favorite movie with her in it so far.<br />I'd reccomend this one to just about anyone- men and women alike will be moved by this movie.
B000001G5A|4.0|La orquesta suena espectacular. El coro es tremendo, pero me desagrada el vibrato de las sopranos. Böhm toma siempre los tempos más lentos, pero para mi el Dies Irae, el Kyrie, y el Domine Jesu deben ser más rapidos, me gusta el Dies Irae tocado como &quot;desesperado&quot;. <br />En todo caso, igual es una gran grabación, es solo un detalle de gustos.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Recently discovered Norah Jones and have only the one CD \\"come away with me\\". Her voice is sweet and captivating. The songs are a mix of mellow and sexy. I would definitely recommend her to the \\"baby boomer\\" generation.

1587990717|4.0|This is a great book that offers a different perspective  on the world  of finance than your average subpar  books written about the markets, trading etc.<br />It enables the reader to question their understanding of 'cause and effect' and look deeply into the role chance plays  in our everyday lives too.  The reader will probably think twice  about using phrases such as 'being at the right place at the right time' after reading this.<br />Some may consider Taleb to be opinionated, arrogant and pedantic, but one must separate the man from his message and enjoy the book for what it's worth.<br />I highly recommend this book.  It will enable the reader to understand the way humans are programmed  to think.
1587990717|5.0|If you are thinking of buying this book so you can beat the market, you would most likely be disappointed.But this is a great book about how to handle risk and randomness in real life. Although most of what is covered in this book is not new to me, as I have spent the last 2 years reading about evolutionary psychology and behavioral finance, this book still helps me a lot. It integrates what I have learned so far in a good perspective and his funny brand of idiosycracies should help me at times to enjoy randomness. Of course, I must admit that I am lucky so far and with Taleb help I should avoid some unluckiness in the future.
0345440900|5.0|I really liked this book. It had some very good tips and useful<BR>information. No book is 100% applicable to every person every time in every situation.  Read the book and use your brain.  <BR>Ignore parts that don't apply to you or you don't agree with.  But don't trash the whole book.  The tables on reading baby <BR>cries were helpful to me.  The very flexible routine makes common <BR>sense.  I gave up on the routine when my son was born. However,<BR>he's 3 months old now and I started to ease into the routine of not feeding right before he naps.  After 2 days, he doesn't want to nurse to sleep - he fusses until I put him in his crib and he sucks his fingers to sleep.  He's also sleeping 11 hours at night<BR>when he doesn't nurse to sleep!  I adjusted EASY to fit my baby and my life... sometimes (mornings) he's hungry after 2 hours, other times (afternoon) it's 4 hours until he's hungry.  As with any book, you should read it with an open mind, adjust and apply the parts that you like and ignore the rest.
B000002ULO|4.0|Paul McCartney returns with 1997's &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; a reference to John Lennon's elaboration on the founding of the Beatles' name.<br />On the heel's of the Beatles &quot;Anthology&quot; series, Flaming Pie shows Paul refreshing his sixties sound with the help of some old friends, producer/guitarist/vocalist Jeff Lynne, producer George Martin, engineer Geoff Emerick, vocalist/guitarist Steve Miller, drummer Ringo Starr, and Linda McCartney.  Linda contributes backing vocals as well as warm and intimate photographs in the sleeve notes.<br />Many of the songs have strong melodies and wonderfully layered vocals, such as &quot;Little Willow&quot; and &quot;Heaven on a Sunday&quot; features a guitar solo by Paul's son, James, his debut on disk.<br />Some of the standout cuts include &quot;The Song We Were Singing,&quot; a nice memory tune about sitting around with friends, talking and singing songs.  The next tune is &quot;The World Tonight&quot; which has a catchy rhythm and raw vocals from Paul.  &quot;If You Wanna&quot; has echoes of &quot;Things We Said Today&quot; with some great guitar interplay between McCartney and Steve Miller. &quot;Somedays&quot; features a dual vocal by Paul as well as an interesting orchestral arrangement by George Martin that provides some beautiful counterpoint.<br />Pauls lyrics are simple, heartfelt and sincere.  &quot;We don't need anybody else, to tell us what is real, inside ieach one of us is love, and we know how it feels&quot; speaks from the heart.<br />My major criticism would be that many of the songs have that Jeff Lynne stamp found on late eighties, early ninties work by George Harrison, Tom Petty and their work with Lynne on the Traveling Wilburys.  You know what I mean, that strummy acoustic guitar and mid-tempo 4/4 beat. Example &quot;Young Boy.&quot;<br />Still, many of the songs hear sound like they had their origins in the &quot;White Album&quot; era that produced &quot;Blackbird&quot;, &quot;Mother Nature's Son&quot; and &quot;I Will&quot;, which isn't so bad.uot; and &quot;I Will&quot;, which isn't so bad.
0064471837|5.0|I have just finished the book yesterday n am already on chapter 3 in the next book LIREAL. SABRIEL is truly a great book. It didn't take me to long to finish it because I couldn't put it down. Even when your not reading it your thinking about it. When you read it it's as if your in another world. I definatley recommend this book to anyone who likes to read books with adventure, action, and suspense with a little bit of romance mixed in with all of them.
B00005KHJM|5.0|British film about Sergeant Howie sent to investigate the disappearance of a young girl, on an Island off of Scotland. What he finds there is a pagan culture, who appears to be manipulating him for something. What that is I wont tell you, but it is a shock, and an investigation in the old religion of England. This is a horror film, a detective story, suspense, and musical. There are many layers to this film, and explores different subjects. The main one is religion, and truth. The visuals are quite spectacular. The music is beautiful. For those interested in paganism, or old nature religions, you will find this interesting. This could also be interesting to Christians because it shows a man of faith standing strong with his beliefs. Anthropologists will also like this film, because it deals with exploring different cultures, and the limitations we have coming from a different culture. The acting in this film is right on, and believable. You should watch with an open mind. 5 stars, check out this cult classic.
0446677450|4.0|I read this book for one of my high school classes; my mom read it as well.  She told me that she wished a book like it were around when she was my age.  Coming from a middle class/poor family, I have failed to learn much about money.  With Rich Dad Poor Dad, I am given the opportunity to learn about the lessons of financing, just as the author was taught.  It is a good book, and it has helped me to understand what it takes to gain financial success.
1580084621|5.0|It couldn't really be any better and the recipes do work. As for the lack of a recipe for fish sauce, it does have a recipe for shrimp paste and says that the fluid which is a by-product makes a wonderful fish sauce so perhaps that would be worth a try. One could probably substitute anchovies for the shrimps if desired.
B00005UK1F|5.0|I must admit, I was a little skeptical of this when I first picked it up. This album comprises a single song that just passes the one-hour mark, and I wasn't sure what to think of that. I figured it might very well be a series of shorter songs, strung together by someone who wanted to write an hour-long song just for the sake of doing so, without the benefit of track breaks. I was wrong.<br />For all its length, &quot;Light of Day, Day of Darkness&quot; never gets boring, never makes you want to skip forward to a later part of the disc. It is clear that this was conceived as a unified whole, and it works very well. The song was composed entirely by Tchort, who used to play bass for Emperor back in the days of &quot;In the Nightside Eclipse,&quot; but those looking for black metal will have to look elsewhere. This song is as emotional as it is atmospheric, and has a surprising level of diversity. It runs the gamut from crushing heavy metal riffs to operatic vocals that wouldn't be out of place in the score of an epic film. This is beautiful music, and something that requires you to pay attention through several listens to pick up on everything that's going on.<br />I'm not exactly sure how to categorize this. It's one of those albums that defies traditional genre boundaries, and that's part of what makes it so interesting. After about a dozen listens through this one, I think I can safely say that it's one of the best metal releases so far this year. Buy it without hesitation.
B00005RFAI|4.0|Pink came back for round two with a whole different sound and approach this time around. Lyrically and musically rock is the main sound here with a small touch of R+b and jazz. A lot of people think she returned to where she really belonged while others think she abandonded her fans by switching but really its neither. Pink can do both rock and r+b .....and do it well. Even on her first album there were elements of rock in her songs. Once you understand that then it will all make sense that the next thing for her to do was switch and do something different..Like now!<br />Whats good? Misundastood, dont let me get me, just like a pill, get the party started, 18 wheeler, misery(soulful feel...mixed with gospel), lonley girl, my vietnam. All these songs are the ones you really check for but everything is good. On this one pink was more direct and str8 forward in everything she did. <br />Overall pink came strong the second time around...showing that she can do more than the typical.....if she is still misundastood...then listen to both albums and you will understand what the deal is.<br />Still not sure?....get it!
B00006J9OT|5.0|My first reaction when I unwrapped the CD was that most of these songs were on other CDs I owned of hers. But the more I listen, the more addicted I get to the energy and talent that is there. I saw her a few years ago when she was still shy about performing. That's changed. She is sometimes a bit overproduced, and I love the raw energy of this performance plus the added bonus of hearing not only her great talent on the piano but that of the extraordinary musicians who back her up.
B00006IUL6|4.0|Let's just get this out of the way, Insomnia is not as good as Memento. I mention this simply because most of my conversations about this film have started like this: \\"What did you think of Insomnia?\\" And the answer would go something like, \\"It was good, but not as good as Memento.\\" Well I don't think that is fair to this film, the performers, or, in particular, Christopher Nolan. Memento is an exceptional film, if not a great film. If Nolan had tried to plug his Memento formula into his next project we would have got another Jackie Brown, I prefer Insomnia. So what do I think? Insomnia is a studio film (a good one at that), a step in the right direction, and it has Al Pacino (The MAN). <br />Disclaimer: Please read someone else's review for a plot summary. I'm not going to spoil, but I just want to talk about why I like it. So, why I like it. Well first, and most certainly foremost, this is first rate filmmaking. Christopher Nolan is a star. Momento was brilliant on several levels, but it was a gimic picture to a certain extent (see it if you haven't). By this rational it is also an innovative film, but that separates it from Insomnia, they shouldn't be compared. However Nolan puts his stamp on Insomnia, much like he did Momento, i.e. Nolan is a unique talant, not a pan in the wash. His pacing is masterful, his visual style is purposeful and consistent, his story is engaging, and he has Al Pacino.<br />Al Pacino. He hasn't been on the screen since Any Given Movie and it was well worth the wait. This DVD has a unique feature on the commentary track. The commentary follows the shooting schedule instead of the narrative. This allows the audience to see how Pacino works. It is a great special feature, as good as any I've seen. It goes without saying that Pacino is an amazing actor, but to be able to see how he evolves and molds his character is such a gift. Watch how the camera envades his personal space, watch how Pacino embraces it. I thought he was excellent in thisfilm. The other heavies are good, but this is Pacino's movie. He carries it.<br />One last thing, the daylight in this film. Nolan has made a dark film in constant light. Inspired.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is one of the most brilliant and beautiful films I have seen in years! Clever, thoughtful provocative, creative and funny.

6304308388|3.0|I don't see too many b&amp;w movies, so I'm glad I caught this one.  I was kept involved the whole time.  I didn't understand why Baxter could never say no to his bosses, but I guess that's from the workplace hierarchy standards of a past time.  Also, I couldn't see why Miss Kubelik was in love w/Sheldrake at all!  I guess she was sweet &amp; dumb.  But I really had a hard time believing Shirley Maclaine in this role because it was really the part for an airhead--maybe a ditzy blonde kind of actress?<br />One scene I will remember most about this movie was the holiday office party scene.  Couples making out in every corner, a real Soddom &amp; Gomorrah or bacchanalia scene.  I was like DAM*, I guess the workplace really HASN'T changed that much over the years!  Because corp. amer. is still like that, only a LITTLE more under wraps (as another reviewer mentioned above, helped by email &amp; pagers &amp; whatnot...)<br />A charming movie--esp. liked neighbors, Doc &amp; wife!  And the woman he picked up at the bar!  This was a quality, well-done film--they don't make 'em like this anymore....
B00005JK8K|5.0|The new DVD only reinforces my initial response that WINDTALKERS is one of the best of the recent WWII movies filmed over the past few years. It is a multi-layered and multi-faceted tale told visually through incredible images enhanced with armor piercing sound effects. The dialogue really has to take a back seat to this simple tale of men and their survival because the images of the land, the bleak faces and the carnage tell it all. This film is named WINDTALKERS but the film does not really focus on the code developed by the Navajo Marines. Director Raoul Walsh had peripherally addressed the Navajo code in 1955 with his film BATTLE CRY with Felix Noriego as Marine Crazy Horse where we saw Japanese operators baffled while listening in on radio and field-telephone transmissions. Director John Woo, as did Raoul Walsh, decides to focus his attention on the men and their diverse backgrounds and what makes them Marines. However, Woo narrows his focus on the relationship between a war-weary, shell-shocked and enigmatic Marine sergeant (Nicolas Cage) and a good-natured naive Navajo recruit (Adam Beach) assigned to him. Beach can't understand the actions or behavior of loner Cage's intensity for killing and bloodshed but learns eventually that if you survive you then increase your chances of having your comrades around you survive as well. Woo is a director noted for action and WINDTALKERS contains some of the most frenetically staged sequences ever filmed. These sequences reminded me of some of Sam Peckinpah's cathartic work from THE WILD BUNCH, the montages of the combat maelstrom of his CROSS OF IRON and the intensity of the intimate fighting of combatants from Edward Zwick's Civil War epic GLORY. This is not action for the sake of action that can be easily labeled on John Woo. Woo is making a statement that all this carnage can be addictive yet simultaneously it usually creates and strengthens intimate camaraderie. But you really can never afford to be close to any of your buddies and this is a highly moral conflict. Is battle weary hardness a symptom or a mechanism to survive? This is the price of defending the ideals that we hold so dear. This is a very subtle and great film that can be easily glossed right over for its true meaning and realization. It was interesting to see that this DVD contains both Widescreen and Pan & Scan versions.your buddies and this is a highly moral conflict.

B00005RYKU|3.0|THE GLASS HOUSE<br />THE MOVIE: An underrated thrill ride! I expected THE GLASS HOUSE to be a pretty silly movie as the opinions of the majority of critics were that. I'll have to be different this time and say I highly enjoyed this nicely done thriller. It has some clichéd/contrived moments and a couple of plot holes, and it could've done without the Stellan Skarsgaard-business-deal-going-wrong idea but the visuals in this movie are outstanding, with many shots suggesting something may be lurking or watching. I loved how the movie kept you in suspense the whole way through and keeps you guessing. All around a well-directed and misunderstood chiller. <br />THE SPECIAL FEATURES: This could've been a lot better. We get great commentary from the writer and the director who help you to understand the ideas behind the shots, angles etc. There are 2 trailers, one for this film and one for URBAN LEGEND. We also get cast and crew filmographies and one deleted scene. There could've been heaps more deleted scenes because during the movie the director says things like &quot;this scene was actually after a scene we deleted&quot; and there is heaps of unused footage that you see in the trailer. That really ticked me off. What's up with just giving us ONE? Grr.

B00003CXE7|4.0|GLADIATOR<BR>2-DISC COLLECTOR'S EDITION DVD<br />THE MOVIE: Frankly you've never seen anything quite like GLADIATOR before. It's a great comeback for the swords 'n sandals epic genre and it mixes in love, drama, brilliant action and a few chills. The movie remains interesting throughout and is very stylishly done. The movie is also lovely in wide screen format. There are a couple of plausibility flaws but with such a big scale you can excuse them. Deserved winner of 5 Academy Awards, including Best Picture.<br />THE SPECIAL FEATURES: Packed with stuff. On one disc there is the movie in wide screen format and on the second you've got all the special features. The Making of featurettes are a thoroughly entertaining treat and they answer all your &quot;how did they do that?&quot; questions. HBO's The Bloodsport of a Gladiator will interest those who are interested in gladiators and old times, personally for me I felt it was boring. From the Cutting Room Floor gives us 25 minutes of deleted scenes which are a delight. You can have them with or without Ridley Scott's commentary. If I were to change this I would've had Ridley Scott giving the commentary before the deleted scene and then showing it. He talks over what's happening and it's quite annoying because if you want to see the commentary you have to go back and forth if you also want to watch the scene. There's also a treasure chest with 7 minutes of unused footage put into a montage. Cool. There's also interviews with Hans Zimmer about scoring Gladiator, which show his compassion for his work and it's interesting to see. Spencer Treat Clark's production diary I couldn't be bothered reading entirely but in places it was pretty good. There are also a whole heap of photos, theatrical trailers and storyboards, plus cast and crew biographies. If only all of this were as entertaining as the movie it would've been a 5-star DVD. But I am unfortunately going to grade GLADIATOR down 1 star because a few of the features are very dull. Plus in some of the scenes the picture quality is BAD! But the sound effects and some very good special features make this worthy of your cash.
B00000F566|5.0|I have been a fan of Dirty dancing for a long time . I have it on VHS but I bought it on DVD because I wanted to feel the music. What I saw on the DVD is beyond my expectations. I don't mind borowing movies to my friends but this one is staying home. It is too good!!!<BR>The movie seemd like a totaly new movie. I love it!!!
B00005Q4CS|4.0|REQUIEM FOR A DREAM<br />THE MOVIE: This movie is not really a 'movie'. I would prefer to call it an experience. What you sit through in this movie affects the people on the screen just as much as it affects the audience. We are put through emotional turmoil watching these characters' dreams slip away from them, we go through the horrors of addiction and experience every emotion that the actors on the screen display. On the subject of acting this movie shows some of the best performances ever in a movie, especially from Ellen Burstyn, who gives a truly indescribable performance. Overall, there is no movie I have ever seen to better the quality seen in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM. <br />THE SPECIAL FEATURES: I would buy this movie on DVD if it had zero special features. It is an essential film for me. It's just a bonus that it has some really cool special features. The best of these is an involving and amazing making of feature that has commentary from Darren Aronofsky. It's stunning to see how much effort and heart went into this production. The Anatomy of a Scene is also very interesting, showing how Aronofsky did many of the camera tricks. We also get quite a few deleted scenes that don't do much to make the DVD better but they don't ruin it either. It's hilarious to see Marlon Wayans mocking JarJar Binks! In Memories, Dreams and Addictions Ellen Burstyn interviews Hubert Selby Jr. about his life. This is a very long interview that doesn't always intrigue the viewer and it was kind of confusing because you don't know if Hubert is being serious or kidding with us. We also get 2 theatrical trailers, a B-roll and audio commentaries from Aronofsky and Matthew Libatique, director of photography.
0451169514|5.0|I will cut to the chase as to WHY this is the BEST BOOK I have EVER read! I consider myself to be a well rounded reader, but this is my favorite by far. King's \\"It\\" is not only more horrifying than anything else ever written (flying leaches, anyone?), it is also more emotionally involving than anything else I've ever read. His portrayal of childhood friendship is powerful and realistic and the book's plot is masterful. The villan is a shapeless eternal force that King does an excellent job of portraying, considering its entity status. The only real criticism that most people have of this book is the orgy scene. While I thought it to be a little extreme, there may well indeed be good reason for it. I interpret it as King's way of saying that sex is the only thing CLOSE to childhood friendship in terms of intimacy and magic, and following the slaying of IT, the characters had become adults, conquering all their fears. Overall, an excellent book, one which will NEVER be forgotten. I've read \\"Crime and Punishment\\", I've read \\"East of Eden\\", but I didn't find any such classics to be as gut-wrenching and emotion-evoking as Stephen King's \\"IT\\"!
B000062TU1|3.0|HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE<BR>2-DISC SET - FULL SCREEN EDITION<br />THE MOVIE: The top-grossing movie of 2001, and without a doubt, one of the top movies overall. What a fantastic experience this was! With perfect casting (all the actors are right on the money), a terrific and involving story-line that is faithful to the book and engaging direction (Chris Columbus brilliantly mixes old tricks to make a really fashionable film) where could HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE go wrong? Well, maybe there are a couple of barely noticeable faults here and there, but nothing to stop this from being a complete 5-star fantasy.<br />THE SPECIAL FEATURES: Oh dear me. What an awful DVD. I would have to go as far as saying even the video is better than getting this. I think this DVD is intended for kids, which is really silly. Kids should buy the PlayStation game; the DVD special features should be for everybody! We get never-seen-before footage and a theatrical trailer but I couldn't figure out how to see them because we've got a bloody \\"game\\" type thing that is pretty much the same as the PlayStation game, blocking us from seeing all the things we want to see. I was so annoyed by this. Adults and adolescents who were expecting an in-depth analysis of this terrific film instead get a kiddie game that analyses \\"how to get into diagon alley\\" and what the sorting hat sorts! Oh, yipee. Oh, joy! I would even go as far as saying kids would probably find this [bad] DVD decent entertainment.<BR>Note: DVD-Rom not previewed.
B00002MZ4W|4.0|I don't listen to singer-songwriter granola or pseudo-jazz that old ladies listen to over brunch. That's what I expected from Fiona Apple.  Listening to this, I am suprised that it is so fresh and adventurous.  There is a little bit of that piano-ballad stuff on this record, but fiona's voice is sexy and the songs are well written.  It would have been five-star if she would have made this a trip-hop record.  \\"A mistake\\" has a little of that vibe.  Her voice and writing is perfect for it, sort of growly and sultry, sometimes laid-back, very passionate.  As it stands this is still cool.  It sounds like fiona isn't afraid to really put herself out there.  She seems kind of nuts, but that is good.  Kooky people write good songs.  Just look at Brian Wilson,Kevin Sheilds (My Bloody Valentine), the guy from the Vines, the guy from Weezer, the list goes on and on.<br />Seeing as I don't usually listen to anything like this and don't know anyone who does, I don't know who to recommend this to.  If you like simple singer-songwriter records this might bum you out, since the production/instrumentation is a little adventurous.  Otherwise I think it is pretty safe to say anyone could find something to like on this record.  To sum up: it's dope, you should check it out.
B000021YQV|5.0|SOAD seems to be a lot more focused on this album compared to their debut. I think this time they realized exactly what they wanted to do with it and went strait for the throat. The last thing I'll say is do not believe the radio SOAD is much more than just an average band.
0385486804|5.0|This book is a truly great work of nonfiction writing by Jon Krakauer.  Thank you Mr. Krakauer for telling this story, and for sharing a bit of yourself in the process.  The concept of the journey into dark wilderness (and its symbolism as the unconscious) is a powerful one.  For those who have dreamed of dropping out of our vulgar, materialistic society, this book is a must read.<br />Chris McCandless' journey is a tragic and riveting tale of a young man with high ideals who ultimately lacked the maturity and wisdom needed to succesfully implement them.  A lesson I took from this story is the value of balance.  Man cannot live by ideals alone; a certain amount of pragmatism/objectivism is necessary for survival in our material world.  Yet how empty this world would be without the ideals and striving that give purpose to what we see and do.<br />On the one hand, Chris McCandless acted in an impulsive and stupid way; people die every year as a result of their ignorance and lack of preparation.  On the other hand, I have to give Chris credit for not doing what a lot of us do -- talk big talk around the coffee house or pub, then on Monday return to our sterile cubicles to drone out another work day; he put his money where his mouth was.  How sad that he did not prepare for his journey in a way that would have enabled him to come back, and live to journey again, sharing his discoveries with family and friends.
B00006FXB6|5.0|It's certaintly looking that way. In short this album kicks ..., there's just no other way to put. The vocals are awesome and it seems like the guys have gotten to be better musicians since Rated R (especialy Nick). There is alot of diversity on this album, but they rarely step outside of rock, there is punk (Six Shooter) metal (Millionaire, Song for the Deaf) Doorsesque rock (God is in the Radio) stoner rock (The Sky is Falling) and even folk (Mosquito Song). All of the songs are memorable and get caught in your head very easily. They recall band like Sabbath and the Stooges, but were a lesser band would just copy the formula (The Hives anyone?) QOTSA give it a breath of fresh air. Take a bow QOTSA you earned it.
B000063UR2|3.0|Certain Director's have improved their films over the years by adding extra footage cut when it was released or placing digital enhancements (Star Trek I, Terminator 2, and Léon- The Professional are happy examples).  However, this wasn't necessarily the case with Legend.  The top reason to buy this DVD is because it comes with both the Origional Version and the US Theatrical Version.  The other would be the myriad of technical details, the making of, and publicity photos along with Commentaries common on many DVD releases.<br />The Director's Cut of this film has Jerry Goldsmith's origional score and alternate scenes along with reattached footage.  I welcome the extra footage because it can fill out certain parts of the story, but the reason why Goldsmith's score was replaced by Tangerine Dream's in the first place was because the music was dry, quiet and dull in someplaces (but not all), especially the dancing scene and closing.  Other parts, like the beginning where Darkness was ordering his minion had given me mixed feelings.  Him announcing his weakness to daylight early and the missing hellish butchering scene disappoined me, but I like the way we didn't see what Darkness looked like until much later, offering an element of mystery.  At the same time, the familar beginning is prefered and should be intact especially when we all know what Darkness looks like anyway.<br />What gets me is the alternate ending.  The end of Darkness was too short and the awakening of Lily was too long, yet incomplete and empty.<br />If Ridley Scott just added extra footage to the US Theatrical version, leaving in Tangerine Dream with some Goldsmith in some parts for the dark moods and left the beginning and ending with what we are famliar with, this would leave us with a happy medium and a good Director's Cut.
B00005YXZH|3.0|I'll say that the songwriting on this album is great, but I was expecting so much more from what I had heard about the album...
0790729628|3.0|While I find many Director's Cuts to be an improvment to the origional, adding extra footage and effects not possible at the time film was shot. Now, if they included the origional Blade Runner with the Director's Cut in a two disk set, with the same sound quality, this will allow fans to be more objective. <br />In my opinion, while the sugary ending (a recycled scene from \\"The Shinning\\", I've heard) is not something I would miss too much, I found the film empty and silent without Deckard's noirish narration, which completes the classic draw of the film and is how it is best remembered.
B00000JG41|5.0|Their music is still crazy, but now it's more subtle, and there's melody in this music. Once you hear this album you'll know that Mr Bungle is one of the most (if not the most) unpredictable band on the face of the Earth.Here are my favorite songs on the album (but all of them are good).<br />Sweet Charity- is this the Beach Boys. You know you're in for something different from Mr Bungle when the album opens up with a sample of seagulls. (10)<br />None of them knew they were Robots- Sounds like swing. (10)<br />Retrovertigo- A more straitfoward ballad, but Mike Patton's vocal work really elevates it. (10)<br />Ars Moriendi- The craziest song on the album (also the best). Has a middle-eastern feel to it, but it is still heavy, but not heavy in a traditional way. (10)<br />Pink Cigarette- Another pop song. Pattan really lays it on thick. A very sad song. (10)<br />Vanity Fair- It's always fun to hear Mr Bungle tackle a style that they haven't done before. Here's their take on gospel. (9.5)
B000002B35|5.0|Este disco es uno de los mejores de Pink Floyd, por supuesto que es mas Gilmour que Waters.. aunque se interpretan temas de Waters tambien. Es buenisimo, hay que tenerlo al igual que The Wall que es mas Waters que Gilmour.
B00005B36H|5.0|Well since there is 1000+ reviews of this album I don't think there is much to said and if you don't already own this album there is probably not much I can say to sway your decision. Laturalus like AEnima is a headphone album (if you don't like it try listening with headphones) and it takes a few listens to get into, mostly because the songs are much longer than the songs that a lot of band write these days. However unlike AEnima they seem to be more serious and is that with the exception of &quot;Mantra&quot; there is an absence of wierd sounds. Tool is obviously no fluke and I have the feeling that in 2005 I will be a very happay man.

B0000046X0|5.0|Chick Corea takes quite a different musical turn with this, the first CD by the second edition of RTF.  Bill Connors, Stanley Clarke, and Lenny White join the legendary keyboardist as he tears those keys UP.  The title song is full of chord changes.  Clarke's contribution, &quot;After The Cosmic Rain&quot;, features excellent solos from he and Corea.  The next song is a faster reworking of &quot;Senor Mouse&quot;.  Chick puts a tag ending for the solo progression in it.  &quot;Theme To The Mothership&quot; deserves to be a fusion anthem.  The two-part &quot;Space Circus&quot; is the true jam here.  Part One is a reworking of Chick's &quot;Children's Song #3&quot;.  We close with the racy &quot;Game Maker&quot;.  For those of you who are curious to know what that sound is that sounds like a synth but isn't, it is a Fender Rhodes distorted with a special pedal effect called &quot;ring modulation&quot;.

0446677450|5.0|I thought Rich Dad Poor Dad was a great book!  I'm a senior in high school and I read this book for my Economics class.  His experiences and words have taught me how to manage money.  I have always been told to go to college, get a good enducation, have a career and then I will become successful.  I realized that I am not taught anything about money in school.  I need to have a strong financial foundation.  In order to make money, I need to be financially literate and understnad the science of making money.  There are also five important obstacles that I must overcome in order to make money:  fear, cynicism, laziness, bad habits and arrogance.  At times, the book was a little slow and it took Kiyosaki a while to make a point.  Overall, the book was simple and easy to read and his advice will serve me in the future.

0553106635|3.0|Dear George Martin,<br />You confuse me Sir. Is this a trilogy or not? If not then I await the next installment in what has been an epic story, full of excitement and intrigue. Should you complete the series I would give my seal of approval and a hearty recommendation to anyone to read these well written and thoroughly entertaining books. <br />However, If this is the final part (which I sincerely hope it is not) then I despair as you would have ended the saga in a confusing, botched, premnature, unfinished and shameful way. To end with &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; would be cruel to your audience and would require you, if you have honour - as I am sure you do, to refund their hard earned money. In either case the message to your readers has not been clear. I suggest you mention this to your publisher as their PR job has obviously been somewhat poor.<br />Sincerely yours,<BR>Andrew Bartlam
B000059Z8J|3.0|Fond memories of being enthralled by this 1978 blockbuster on its original release prompted me to buy this DVD. Alas, not only has the movie's lustre dimmed--does anything you like at age 18 hold up a quarter-century later?--but the DVD package doesn't even manage to make it seem more momentous than it is.<br />First, my view of the movie nearly a quarter-century after first seeing it: Although my nostalgic fondness for it holds up, it doesn't seem as filling a box of popcorn now. Nothing wrong with the basic arc of the story (the origins of Superman, and his first adventures as a caped crimefighter), and this probably is still the best movie built around a comic-book character. But the campy tone in the Metropolis and Lex Luthor sequences undercuts the sense of wonder the movie was aiming for. Christopher Reeve's performance as the Man of Steel seems just right--earnest, but with a sense of humor and a disarming modesty. However, the movie's Lex Luthor--Gene Hackman, who can be spine-tingling as a villain (see \\"Unforgiven\\")--seems to be in a different movie. The labored \\"comic\\" byplay between Lex Luthor and his dim-witted henchman Otis (the normally fine Ned Beatty) seems to have been acted in slow motion. The movie's production values haven't aged too well, so in many shots Superman's \\"flying\\" ability seems less convincing than that of the winged monkeys in \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" made almost 65 years ago.<br />As for the DVD: They've generally done a pretty spiffy job of remastering the sound (for one thing, John Williams' score--not his finest, yet appropriately heraldic--no longer sounds as though it was recorded in an echo chamber), but the picture quality seems more grainy than it did in the theatrical release (even though they did color-correct a few blue-screen shots where Superman's costume looked GREEN in the movie's original release). The extras aren't all that enthralling, either, although they have their moments.<br />But my main complaint is the \\"SpecialEdition\\" format. For those who'd like to watch the movie as it was originally released, too bad. Either you have to put up with 20 or so minutes of added scenes (which by themselves aren't of much consequence--and what is worse, they're clumsily inserted, breaking up the flow of a movie that already suffers from uneven pacing), or you stick with the VHS version. There's no option of choosing between the original, released cut and the longer \\"Special Edition,\\" as you get with the \\"T2\\" DVD set (or the new \\"E.T.\\" release). Director Richard Donner has gone on record as saying that his \\"director's cut\\" was the 142-minute theatrical version, not this (which doesn't even incorporate all of the \\"missing\\" footage that network-TV broadcasts reinstated years ago).
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Those who found them bland in the late 70s are probably not going to have their minds changed by this two-disc best-of, but the fact remains: They were the finest pop act of the Carter-Reagan era (admittedly, there wasn't much competition). While \\"The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac\\" understandably skips their pre-Buckingham Nicks period and inexplicably jumbles the chronology, it is hard to argue with the song choices (even if the three later cuts at the end ARE a bit bland). On the first disc especially, the hits just keep on keeping on. In fact, the only WHAT-WERE-THEY-THINKING? omission is the lovely, Everlyesque \\"I Don't Want to Know\\" from Rumours (I say we start an e-mail campaign to have it added to future pressings). This long-time fan would also substitute Buckingham's jaunty/funny \\"Not That Funny\\" for Buckingham's jaunty/dumb \\"Family Man,\\" and delete the draggy, oversung live versions of \\"I'm So Afraid\\" and \\"Go Insane\\" for the original studio versions. But I'm nitpicking. Bottom line: Buy this and Rumours and you WILL have the \\"very best\\" of Lindsay Buckingham's Fleetwood Mac. One caveat, though, for those of us over forty: Listening to these songs may make you long wistfully for the days when pop music was made by actual musicians over the age of twenty with actual romantic attachments to actual human beings other than themselves. In a post 9/11 world Fleetwood Mac's sunny, SoCal innocence is more poignant than ever. Who knew Stevie Nicks would age so well?
B00003CY5J|4.0|The Score doesn't offer anything new to the heist genre, but the three generations of great actors coming together here makes this one worthwhile.<br />In many ways, the plot of this film is weak. A professional thief (Robert DeNiro) decides to do one more job before retiring from the business (that hasn't been done before, now has it?). His girlfriend (Angela Basset) is eager for him to put it behind him, but his boss (Marlon Brando) needs him to do the job of stealing a $30 million scepter to pay his way out of trouble, and enlists a cocky amateur (Edward Norton) to help his man.<br />The film, directed by Frank Oz, then follows the rules of the genre,  creating no new surprises, no unique twists, and only one thing that truly keeps your interest: The opportunity to see Brando and DeNiro together for the first time, with Norton in the mix. The three great actors from different generations coming together raises this mediocre film to another level. Sure it's a novelty device, but sometimes novelties are just so much fun.<br />This is a three star movie with a bonus star for the cast. Just don't expect anything too great along the lines of plot.

B000067CPX|5.0|When I first ran across the RHCP about 10 years ago, their on-stage posturing made me think they were a bit of a joke.  However, I recently revisited their music,listening to What Hits and Blood Sugar Sex Magick, both of which impressed me very much for the same reasons everyone else was imnpressed: \\"intoxicating and original blend of funk and punk, assured vocals, blah, blah, blah\\" (i.e., the gist of the all the reviews that one reads). I then purchased By the Way and now consider RHCHP as one of the most important groups in rock.  OK. This CD could have been edited a bit, as some of the music gets a bit \\"samey\\" but, overall, it is hard to resist. The two main aspects that I like about the music on this CD are: 1) the sense of SPACE between the various instruments. What a refreshing break from the wall of sound of so many bands that ends up wearing down the listener and 2) the vocals. What a pleasure to hear a group where the members can ACTUALLY SING. The lead vocals and harmonies are very charismatic.  I am so tired of the nasally, halfhearted Neil Young-school vocals that one hears from 90% of the groups out there.  As a relative newcomer to RHCP, I tend to see their output as a whole. From that perspective, By the Way's smoother sound juxtaposed with their funkier, brash earlier work gives their music a richness that is matched by few other bands.
0316666343|1.0|What is all the hype about this book? The Lovely Bones is a very bad novel. It is riddled with odd , pointless plot twists, not the least of which is a zombie-like love scene with bizarre necrophilic overtones. <BR>Characters are at best cardboard cutouts of people. Buckley, the Salmon's youngest child, is more of a pet than a young person. Alcoholic Grandma Lynn (alcoholism in the elderly is always an endearing quality ) is supposedly a wise, semi-matriarchal figure who knows what's best but unfortunately never has much of anything to say. Susie's parents, her sister Lindsey and fiancee Sam, neighbors, high schools friends, Hal, detective Len, Susie Salmon.....none develop into characters who have anything to tell us. Do we ever really care about any of them? Ironically, Mr. Harvey , Susie's murderer, is the most intriguing of the lot...and we are meant to despise him.<BR>Shouldn't a novel that deals with the horrific death of a young person offer up to us glimpses into the human heart? <BR>Instead, as page after page goes on, we get the sensation of slowly sinking to the bottom of a bottomless ocean.<BR>Susie Salmon and The Lovely Bones sleep with the fishes.
B000002UDB|5.0|Magical Mystery is contantly overlooked when people discuss the Beatles albums.  I don't understand why.  Other reviewers have mentioned the cover art and the fact that it feels like a bunch of singles.  But, this shouldn't matter.  Look at the B-side of this album!  It contains five of the best songs of all time.  And its the B-side!!<BR>Magical Mystery Tour- A great song to open up your imaginantion to this album.  It serves the same purpose as Sgt. Pepper...GET READY!<BR>The Fool on the Hill- One of my favorite McCartney ballads. For some reason, it sticks with you.<BR>Flying- An instrumental that makes you feel like you are actually Flying. ...<BR>Blue Jay Way- Very... George.  I like how creepy and phycadelic it is.<BR>Your Mother Should Know- A great one to dance to.  Not very deep but great despite.<BR>I am the Walrus- Lennon was friggin' brilliant! This song alone proves it. <BR>Hello, Goodbye- Such a classic.  I love it because it shows that the Beatles can make opposites cool.<BR>Strawberry Fields Forever- One of my favorite Beatles songs.  The lyrics are sheer brilliance. (Living is easy with eyes closed...)<BR>Penny Lane- Paul at his best.  Amazing.<BR>Baby Your a Rich Man- Why isn't anyone mentioning this song in their reviews? I love it. It is a great rocker.<BR>All You Need is Love- The song of a generation. This song really says what the Beatles were all about.
B00006F7S4|5.0|...Sure, you could look at it and laugh in a way but even then, the laugh is short lived.  Many critics are dubbing Sea Change a masterpiece.  I'm not so sure I could bestow that title upon this album, but I can however honestly say that this is a truly great piece of work.  MOST of his indecipherable mumblings have faded and true poetry has emerged.  You can actually feel sorry for Beck if these songs really are a product of his recent problems.  This is definitely not some party slacker anthem like the songs from Mellow Gold or Odelay! but rather an album meant for you to listen to alone at home when you're feeling bummed or its rainy out.  Granted that may not leave many times for you to listen to this, but when the chances arrive it will suit the mood or weather perfectly.  \\"I Guess I'm Doing Fine\\" is wonderful and lets you see Beck really can sort of sing.

B000067CPX|5.0|I have one good reason to give this CD 5 stars. I went to the Chili Peppers concert here in Caracas, Venezuela, without listening to the CD. I had only heard \\"By The Way\\" and \\"Zephyr Song\\". On the way to the concert, the guy who drove us there had the CD so he put in on, so at that time I had a glimpse of what I was going to hear that day. So I got there, looking forward to listen to some good oldies (\\"Under The Bridge\\", \\"Suck My Kiss\\", \\"Fire\\", etc.), and sure I got the pleasure of listening to some of them beautifully played by The RHCP Guys. However, they played these new songs and, I don't know if it was all the emotion, but they sounded great to me. These songs I can now recognize as \\"Universally Speaking\\", \\"Don't Forget Me\\", \\"Can't Stop\\" and \\"Venice Queen\\".<br />After this wonderful experience, I bought the CD within a couple of days, and it just keep getting better. One of my favorites is definetly \\"Don't Forget Me\\", but you HAVE to see John Frusciante playing this song live. He's just great playing. \\"Can't Stop\\", \\"Dosed\\", \\"Minor Thing\\", \\"Venice Queen\\", in fact, ALL of them. It's a great CD, you gotta buy it.<br />One thing, though, this is NOT \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\". And I think you shouldn't expect to listen to another CD like that one EVER. Because good musicians evolve, and they try new things. That's what I think just happened with RHCP. They evolved into a more soft and beautiful sound. Just buy it, put in in your Discman, put your headphones, lay down and let the music flow.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|The wait is finally over. Disney has finally released Beauty and the Beast on DVD, and they appear as if they've outdone themselves. We not only get a restored version of the film, but 3(!) different versions, including the work-in-progress and the IMAX re-release all in glorious widescreen. However, everything is not quite what it seems.<br />Let's start with the presentation of the film itself. They've done a fabulous restoration as the film has never looked cleaner or brighter. The new song patched into the special edition is quite catchy and is good for variety's sake. It's wonderful to have the inclusion of the work-in-progress version, and it really displays the film's artistry. What's disappointing is that all 3 versions are on the same disc, and the quality suffers from it. The compression used has essentially created low-resolution images that often display \\"jaggies\\" throughout, which can be distracting. Also, the aspect ratio is different than on the original laserdisc release, effectively cropping off the top and bottom of the film so that we actually see less than what we saw in the theater. Is it any different than making the film full-screen and losing the left and right edges? Interestingly enough, the work-in-progress differs from the laserdisc release in that the title card has been replaced with the final card, a production credit has been removed from the intro, and some of the edits and transitions are rougher. The disc claims that this version is \\"as shown\\" at the 1991 New York Film Festival, but somehow I doubt it. It's a shame that this version wasn't put on the 2nd disc as a supplement, leaving the other two versions with a better visual quality.<br />Nonetheless, disc 2 contains a ton of great supplemental features. Most of the good stuff documents the genesis of the film up to the Special Edition theatrical release in one form or another. Some of the other items (games, music videos) are kind of lame and are worth viewing only once. There is a very challenging \\"West Wing\\" game (NOT about Martin Sheen and company), but that took only a couple of times to master and the payoff is lousy. An awful lot of work for basically nothing, but my 4 year-old loves it.<br />Still, this is the only DVD release being offered and you can't go wrong with it, despite my complaints. It's just too bad that in Disney's haste to cram as much stuff on this set as possible, they've damaged the release. 'Twas beauty that killed this \\"Beast.\\" Knocked down 1 star due to the low-resolution transfers.
0446677450|5.0|Kiyosaki and Lechter taught me the difference between assets and liabilities (what he calls<BR>the key to getting rich) through simple diagrams. One major factor that makes Rich Dad,<BR>Poor Dad such an all around good book is that the authors not only teach how to be good<BR>with money, but also how to be a good human being in the process. They include five<BR>obstacles to overcome that also are slow development of the asset column. They are: fear,<BR>cynicism, laziness, bad habits, and arrogance. The reader is told to learn from his or her<BR>losses, and \\"remember the alamo!\\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad was not any old boring text book<BR>telling me how to count my pennies, it was real life stuff that gave a me a foundation in<BR>understanding how money works as a high school student, and how to avoid making bad<BR>decisions in business for the future.

B000002AH7|5.0|This legendary album is a milestone in jazz, a disc where everthing seems to fit into the right place: great ensemble playing, a superb selection of music, and, most of all, the absolutely astounding soloing of Miles Davis.  The most famous piece is the first, a version of the adagio from Joaquin Rodrigo's famous classical guitar concerto 'concierto de aranjuez', expanded  by Davis' collaborator Gil Evans, one of the most important creative partnerships in jazz.  It is a classic, a superb jazz treatment of a classical work, in both the original performance and the alternative version that is a bonus track on this issue, which to me, is even better-there is more depth of emotion (if such a thing is possible) than on the original, a rawness and passion.  There is another classical work, 'Will o' the wisp' by Manuel de Falla, a shorter and less intense experience than the Rodrigo, with a different flavour-mysterious and with a sinister undertone.  Listen out for the slinky, dark rhythms, and multicoloured orchestral pallette.  Thirdly, we have a Spanish folk melody, 'The Pan Piper', that  Evans heard a pig castrator play on a penny whistle!  The unmistakable trumpet of Miles hovers over a static, glittering, orchestra.  After that, an incredible emotional; display: 'Saeta'.  This is a traditional Spanish proccession, in which a woman on a balcony tells of the story of Christ's death and ressurrection.  Brass fanfares introduce Miles' solo, in which he plays the part of the woman with astounding concentration and display of raw emotion.  Then, 'Solea' (coming from the word for loneliness) by Gil Evans.  After a slow introduction, the rhythm picks up and we begin a march in which Davis, as the linter notes put it 'fervently links the cries of flamenco and blues'. Another bonus track, 'Song of our country', is in more of a South American than a Spanish vein.  <BR>What this disc captures so precisely, so movingly, so clearly, is the sadness that lies at the heart of what we think of as  Spain, a sense of melancholy, of grief.  The tone of Miles' trumpet, so brilliantly displayed in 'Porgy and Bess', reaches another stage here- he is given the space to make his own unique sound.  If you buy no other jazz album, then this is the one to get.
0446677450|4.0|This book is extremely informative and interesting.  However I think it stresses that education doesn't make you rich too strongly.  By telling his dad's story about him getting an education yet never making enough, it gives us no hope to having a legitimate living.  Kiyosaki is very detailed and explains thoroughly yet he stressed assets so strong it's as if nothing else if there. It is a good book, but not one I would shape my life around
B000063NPX|5.0|Before I die I want to be kissed - just once - the way the prince kisses Belle at the end of the movie. Yes -- I know it's animated.
B00003CXTF|5.0|This is one of the best films of this proportion that I had seen in a long time.  The Director, Michael Bay has done a superb job of creating a realistic setting of the attack on Pearl Harbor.  The actors do a wonderful job of portraying characters who may have lived during that time in history.  Ben Affleck plays Rafe McCawley, Josh Hartnett is Danny Walker and Kate Beckinsale plays Evelyn Johnson.  The three main characters become involved in a love triangle unknowingly, the two men are in armed forces and she is a nurse.  The war scenes seemed realistic and all the while the love story was still engaged.  This film brought back a lot of emotion for people who had not forgetton this tragedy.  This movie aided younger Americans in connecting with generations who had lived during this horrible period in time.  I feel this film has not received the credit it is due unfortunately.  I wish this film would have preceeded Titanic, maybe then it would have received some much deserved honors.  I recommend this film to anyone who is interested in war/history films or just plain love stories.
6302913896|1.0|BEWARE!! I know that it's going to be hard to wait for the rest of the episodes to be released to DVD (especially if you've already purchased and watched the first seven episodes on DVD), but trust me, wait for DVD. You'll end up saving yourself a lot of time and energy. The VHS tapes are in deplorable condition--the sound goes in and out, the screen is fuzzy and jumps, and it's difficult to make out what is going on. Don't try to struggle through it--just wait for it to come out on DVD and watch it in good condition. You'll be glad you did, especially when you come across the more &quot;shocking&quot; and exciting scenes in episodes 10-14.
B00006HBUB|5.0|I just saw this movie and I was simply AMAZED. It is in keeping with the outlandish plots of the Scooby Doo cartoons, and the acting wasn't bad either. I began watching this movie with low expectations, but the tounge-in-cheek humour and the &quot;mary jane&quot; references had me rolling. My 3 year old loved it too, and he wasnt frightend in the least by the &quot;monsters&quot;. While he was amazed by the realistic Scooby, I was amazed by the flawless exchanges between the actors (namely Shaggy!) and the computerized Scooby Doo. Kudos to all involved.
0316666343|4.0|What a unique read this was. At first I found it a bit difficult to read. The whole premise of the book, losing a child, was heart wrenching. But once I kept reading, I found it difficult to put down. Sebolds ideas of heaven were wonderful and refreshing. Instead of  being sad I found myself smiling. When I finally finished the book, (which was in just a night or two), I found myself missing it! I was intrigued from the moment I saw this book on a book review on tv. If it spoke to you, listen to your heart, you wont be disappointed it.
B00003CXI0|5.0|I was never a Harry Potter fan and I never understood the craze but Ive always been one to give things the benefit of the doubt so I rented this  movie...and all I could say was WOW! Two days later I bought it on VHS and have since watched it over five times. The cast was convincing, the story kept you intrested all the way until the end, the costumes and settings where incredible. Makes one wish Hogwarts really did exist. I havent read the books yet but I know Ill eventually get to reading them. Its a fantastic movie for all ages, Im 20 years old and Ill probably watch it a dozen times more. Cant wait until the next Harry Potter movie is released because this time I wont wait for it to come out on video, Ill be the first in line at the movies...besides who can resist that adorable british accent :)
0736041850|5.0|This incredibly detailed book was just what I needed.

0140283587|5.0|Having returned from basically the same Indian scene 25 years ago and never having fully recovered, this book was an emetic beyond its own description of one (mild dysentery).  Though I've returned to India many times, my first experience was exactly as Sutcliffe describes.  The insular, flaming arrogance of the privileged kids that come and go, learning nothing but from each other, is apparently a part of the Indian economy and may one day even become a sect unto itself.  Holy it is to wrap yourself in brightly colored rags, hari om, and live for nothing, hari om, till the next check clears, hari om.  A culture rich in music that defies description, in exalting dance, they will never know, but only return to the West deserving their memories of the canned, tinny Hindi pop that's blasted in the markets, and the vulgar billboards that advertise an addiction to cliches.  How many more bored dilettantes will it take to convince India of its shallowness and two-dimensionality?
B00005ATQF|5.0|First off, I have to come clean.  I first saw Full Metal Jacket in its original theatrical release.  About all that stayed with me was the scene in the head that ends the second third of the film.  I bought it at the recommendation of my son, a newly-commissioned Second Lieutenant in the Marines.  He calls FMJ the \\"Marine Movie.\\"  He also calls the time period \\"one shameful chapter in Marine Corps history.\\"  The routine abuse of recruits depicted in the film no longer happens.  Even so, the film gets it right on both counts.  Marine training, even thirty years later, is as demanding as Kubrick depicts.  It has the same goal:  the creation of \\"indestructible men (and now, women)\\" who can kill as many of the enemy as possible.  The experience of Marines in combat, especially in Vietnam, is as the film demonstrates.  As he undergoes training that will qualify him to lead a platoon, I asked my son about the incident that leads to the second cold-blooded killing.  Could it have happened that Marines would become so lost that they would be at the mercy of a sniper?  Absolutely, he replied, adding that Marines view the prospect of urban warfare with trepidation:  \\"There is an infinite number of places where the enemy could be.\\"  Further, he said, Cowboy made the right call, even though it resulted in the deaths of three Marines.  <br />Even though I was in the streets in a different way during Vietnam (and could not have seen combat anyway--I'm blind in my right eye and right-handed), I am convinced that Semper Fi is for real.  \\"Semper Fi, do or die, gung ho, gung, ho, gung ho.\\"  The Marines are indeed the best we have, the inspiration for Army Rangers and Delta Force and Navy SEALS.  They have raised the bar in ways that I didn't appreciate.  Run, don't walk, to see this movie.
B00004YZFR|4.0|This film, in hindsight,  is a clear example of how NOT to arrange a free outdoor concert. But I do not fault the Stones for attempting to give those Californian flower children an outdoor performance, because the band truly believed that it would equal  Woodstock as the relatively drug-fueled, tranquil event that the former had been. I do, however, fault Mick Jagger's incredibly poor judgment in hiring the Hell's Angels for stage security while allowing them to get tanked on all the free beer they could guzzle. And one glance at an Angel's biker sneering at Jagger as he stood onstage to his immediate right indisputably summed up what the Angels as a whole thought of hippies in general and, of course, the Stones/Jagger in particular. The band were at their peak back then, with Mick Taylor fabulously wailing away on his Gibson on such numbers as \\"Satisfaction\\" and \\"Love in Vain\\", especially. But a great show was marred by a countless array of unnecessary beatings that were contrasted by a justifiable, yet savagely  fatal stabbing of an armed psycho runnng towards the stage. And  poor Marty Balin's brutal pool-cue clubbing by the Angels earlier should have prompted the Stones to perhaps consider cancelling, but then again, there would have been no performance/movie to follow, and years later, no DVD version of it to watch. A tragic piece of Rolling Stones history, indeed.
B00006BXI0|5.0|Just a few statements:<br />This is the one that's in my CD player most often.<br />Symphony-X is the best progressive metal band in existence.<br />Russ Allen is the best and most veratile metal vocalist in existence.<br />Mike Romeo is the scariest guitarist in existence.<br />Now, to talk about DWoT: This album has great production, and the vocals are well displayed in the mix, unlike Symphony-X's \\"V\\".  Although \\"V\\" has songs that are more ambitious, DWoT is a better listen for me due to the superior, heavier production.<br />The only other album that I listen to NEARLY as much is the latest Vanden-Plas, \\"Beyond Daylight\\".  Both DWoT and \\"Beyond Daylight\\" are, to my mind, almost perfect albums in their own ways.  Again, \\"V\\" WOULD be in my CD player constantly as well, if it weren't for the poor showing of the vocals in the mix.<br />Vanden-Plas' \\"Beyond Daylight\\" is a fantastic alternative to Dream Theater fans who might be tired of the pretentious BS and the shrill shrieking that LaBrie sometimes succumbs to.<br />In comparison, Symphony-X's DWoT is more of an \\"Yngwie on steroids meets Kansas meets Queen meets Metallica\\"  kind of CD.  Allen is the kind of metal singer that everyone WISHES they could be.  Take all the best metal and rock singers, roll them into one, and you're on your way to creating Russ Allen.  His influences seem to include, but aren't limited to, Dio, Dickenson, Steve Walsh, Queen, a little Joe Lynn Turner, and strangely enough, he reminds me of the late Carl Albert from Vicious Rumors.<br />The songwriting on this album is SUPERB, and you'll find yourself singing along in no time.  However, I deliberately said \\"almost perfect\\" earlier because of a glaring weak spot.  Namely, I REALLY don't like the keyboard-based orchestral instrumental section during the intro to the title track.  There is an amazing and haunting choral vocal section at the very beginning, but that high is pretty much shattered by the artificial sounding samples of the Holst-Mars ...that immediately follows.  The horns in particular sound like [junk].  Once past this point, however, things improve drastically, and we're back to hearing something magical again.<br />This band and this CD is like no other, and any comparisons to bands like \\"Blind Guardian\\" or other such ilk is misleading and a tragic injustice.  Once you hear Symphony-X, you will be ruined, because almost every other prog-metal band in existence sounds weak in comparison.<br />See you at the San Fran and Hollywood shows!!!

B00003W8NM|2.0|I cannot believe some of the reviews that this film gets.This isnt a bad film but its annoys me when i see people trying to compare A Clockwork Orange to this film,please dont there is NO comparision.Ive seen this twice because apparrantly your supposed to understand better the more you watch it and pick up on new things in the film.This isnt so.When i saw it it for the first time i thought to myself at the end that this film just didnt make sense.In the ending of the Usual Suspects the whole film gets turned around on its head by a shocking revelation. The same thing happens in Fight Club but it DOESNT work.The fact that Brad Pitts character didnt exist after all can only be used so much in covering up the many holes in the plot.This is why, when i saw this film for the second time it didnt make more sense to me , it made me realise that this film doesnt work.The whole idea of the Fight Club being started was because some guys saw Pitt and Nortons character fighting in the car park, but we then learn that Pitt and Norton are the same person if this is so, then surely the 'Fight Club' would be about beating yourself up.Because in reality Norton was just beating himself up.There are so many more flaws in this film it is quite unbelievble and the fact that Pitt and Norton are the same person cannot cover them all up which i think the writers hoped it would.Things like the 2 Fight Club members in the car reacting to BOTH Pitt and Nortons character at the SAME time.You can clearly see that they both physically react to Norton and Pitt you may think this strange considering that Pitt and Norton are the same guy. I think most of the the fans of this film only like it because of the 'cool' fighting and violence.I can assure you that i dont mind the violence in this film at all and have seen and liked films much more violent than this but you cannot call this a great film because the fight scenes are cool.<br />OVERRATED
B00006AULI|5.0|I am a horror movie junkie, i love them to death,..(heh!) anyway i watched this movie before i went to bed one night and it disturbed me so much i had trouble sleeping. Belive me i havent had that problem sience i was a child. this movie deserves ten stars!
B000002H33|5.0|After a few years of first hearing Load and Reload (of [trash]), I disliked Metallica for a while... until I heard this milestone 1986 album, which was also the last for bassist Cliff Burton.<br />This has to be one of the best thrash metal albums ever made.  \\"Battery\\" kicks the album off perfectly, with other songs like \\"Disposable Heroes\\" and the title track to shred between mid-paced songs like \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" and \\"Sanitarium.\\"  Practically every song on this excellent!  They even made a good instrumental piece (\\"Orion\\") to rank up with the previous album's instrumental, \\"Call of Ktulu.\\"<br />This is a metal masterpiece, through and through.  Yes, Metallica sold out and we will probably hate them forever for it.  Nevertheless, there's no denying this Puppets' importance to the genre of metal.
6304708521|3.0|This is a McCartney project from the get-go. On the heels of Brian Epstein's untimely demise, Paul felt a need to show the world the Beatles still had a sense of creative autonomy. In actual truth, the germ of inspiration for MMT came to PM while they were still making Sgt. Pepper. The resulting acid-tinged filmed bus excursion through the scenic (yet unsuspecting) English countryside was a \\"splendid time guaranteed for all....\\" (\\"all\\" EXCEPT maybe the ENTIRE brittish TV audience that tuned in to watch it on Boxing-Day, 1967 and were collectively aghast, it seems) Widely known as the Fab's first and ONLY \\"failure\\", the Magical Mystery Tour film is nevertheless HISTORIC on several levels. But there are misconceptions to clear up : Firstly, it has been interminably criticized for being \\"plotless\\" and \\"scriptless\\"------but what people dont understand was that THIS was Paul's precise INTENTION. It was made during the height of PSYCHEDELIA (a phenomenom the Beatles THEMSELVES helped to usher in earlier that same year with the advent of their magnum opus \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\") Working class people in the North of England--of the same ilk the Beatles themselves arose, would frequently take leisurely coach trips or day journeys on weekends into the country. They were called \\"Mystery Tours\\" --- because more often than not, the passengers were kept uninformed as to the journey's final destination...it was kept a \\"surprise\\" or, \\"mystery\\". Paul's idea, according to his well-written autobiography \\"Many Years From Now\\", was to make a hippie-era, psychedelic variation on this theme...and call it a \\"MAGICAL Mystery Tour\\" (the LSD implication was obvious-- and I'm SURE he was cognizant of Ken Kesey's trans-continental bus \\"trip\\" across the US that took place three years earlier with the \\"Merry Pranksters\\") As with the conventional \\"Mystery Tour\\" passengers, the motley assortment of circus freaks and hangers-on that accompanied the Lads from Liverpool on THEIR version were ALSO not told ofthe final \\"destination\\".... but did anyone care ??? Hell NO!! THAT was the very point. Paul was INTENTIONALLY paying homage to the French new-wave avante-gaurde film directors he apparently admired so much privately. The clueless and UNsavvy English film critics establishment at the time couldnt figure out WHAT the point was. The \\"point\\" was it was supposed to be a 60's \\"happening\\"...a \\"non-event\\" that was filmed. On THAT level it certainly DID succeed. The film is now widely credited for offering the first self-contained \\"music videos\\"--- an innovation the MTV GENERATION owes to Sir Paul directly. Disjointed, aimless and self-indulgent a relic as it may appear to many, Magical Mystery Tour is also deemed a bold, inventive and whimsical piece of Flower-Power Age ART (in the Peter Max tradition) that is appreciated more and more as it ages (albeit UNgracefully), and gathers a larger and larger cult following. One day it's \\"coming to take us ALL away...\\" The ticket master is over there.....hey, he looks suspiciously like John Lennon, doesnt he ???
B00005JKDR|3.0|With the good word of mouth the movie received, I was disappointed at not being able to see it at a movie theater when it first came out. It seemed as though it would be a movie worth the price of admission, so I gladly forked over the bling bling for the DVD. I should have rented it first!<br />Though most of Pixar's animation is amazing, the opening sequence seemed as though it belonged to a different movie. There was nothing clever about it. The story, however, has a great premise and many of the ideas mined to support it really hit the mark. Mr. Goodman's Sullivan is played wisely. Boo is a beautiful creation. The complexity of the monster world reflects well the dedication of its creators and the care that they took in making the film. <br />There are some really bad choices however. Mike Wazowski had a lot of potential if it had not been for the decision to portray him as such a whiney braggart. Mr. Crystal plays Mike way over the top and is at his most annoying. The friendship that Sulley and Mike share seems very one-sided. Nothing would suggest that Mike would act nobly. The twist at the end of the movie was also hardly original and was as unsatisfying as it was in Mission Impossible.<br />The second DVD is very interesting.  The creative effort that went into the movie is astonishing.  At the risk of being accused of being too picky and without a life, I have the following request of Pixar:  Enough with the \\"supposed\\" outtakes!  They were funny in Toy Story and A Bug's Life, now they're just boring.
0140131558|4.0|If you're looking for detective stories, look elsewhere.  Auster isn't interested in the classic noirish private eye tale as anything but a way into territory vastly more compelling.  Though his three novellas ostensibly revolve around men hired or driven into the pursuit of others, they end up being more about the psychology of the pursuer than the pursued.  Surveillance of the self and the collapse of what we assume is our own identity is the abiding theme here, and Auster gives it three fascinating spins with simple plots which quickly spiral to literary altitudes.  But don't expect simple resolutions.  There are no straightforward answers here.  If these were simple issues, they wouldn't justify the exploration Auster gives them.  I had the pleasure of reading this immediately prior to Auster's \\"The Art of Hunger\\" (1997), a collection of essays and interviews which reveals, among other things, how \\"The New York Trilogy\\" blends aspects of his autobiography, literary theories and abiding interests into a fascinating work of fiction.  Read them together. Then read everything else he's written. You won't be disappointed.
0811836363|4.0|The Beatles would admit that being at the right place at the right time had a lot to do with their cultural impact. What Anthology also reveals is that The Beatles weren't there by accident. They had the impact they did for the same reason that Elvis did; they changed the rules of the game and were playing a constant game of one upmanship. <br />Certainly there were other important bands from this period. The cultural impact the band had resulted as much from their talent as the press coverage of their every move. 40 years after their debut single Anthology manages to convey both the impact of the band and the changing values of the time they worked within. The book is packed with interesting tidbits, trivia and the band's unique perspective from inside the fishbowl of fame. <br />Anthology allows the band to tell their own story. With the murder of John Lennon over 20 years ago and the recent death of George Harrison, there are less and less eyewitnesses to a major shift in the cultural fabric that surrounds us. Anthology provides context and content as to why things changed in the 60's. They may not have been the catalyst of change but The Beatles made that change acceptable for good and bad.<br />In our modern fragmented culture, there are few performers that could continue to have the same impact that these four people did have. Anthology provides a fascinating glimpse into history from the inside out.
6301966015|4.0|This movie is a gem.  Not only is a fantastic film, but music fans will love the cameo by The Yardbirds.  And, it was an interesting cameo.  This was during the Jeff Beck era, when the band was riding high on their biggest success.  And, Beck recruited his childhood friend to play in the band as well, Jimmy Page.  The cameo is almost worth the price of owning the film, since their performance of \\"Stroll On\\" (which would later become their legendary track \\"Train Kept-A Rollin'\\" was during a time when both guitar legends were in the band.  Afterward, Beck would be ousted, and pursuing his own projects, and Page would become the foreground of The Yardbirds, as they slowly evolved to Led Zeppelin.  Their performance was as raucous as they were known for, with Beck smashing his guitar, and beating his amp.  A great moment in rock & roll, captured in a motion picture, forever.<br />As for the movie itself, it is one of the greatest films put to tape.  David Hemmings plays one of the most arrogant, demanding, and frankly vulgar photographers portrayed on screen.  He is wealthy, successful, and quite popular, and apparently it went to his head.  The man has enough gall to actually grab a model's leg, and slam it into the position he expected her to put it.  And, to an aspiring model, requesting a tryout, all he could say to her is \\"...get rid of that bag! It's diabolical!\\"<br />His personal and professional life is changed forever when he meets a lady in a park, played by Vanessa Redgrave.  Redgrave is as alluring and mysterious as I have ever seen her.  And, she leads the photographer into a combination of danger and opportunity, as he discovers, pictures he took of her and a man in the park reveal a murder.<br />Not a dialogue heavy film, most modern conterporary film watchers could sit through this.  (Meaning: if you liked Titanic, it's not for you.)  But, who cares! It wasn't made for them anyways.  The imagery, photography, and use of physical expression all add up tosome of the best cinematography I have ever seen.  This film is enough to prove to me a good movie need not have CGI nor stunts.<br />The picture literally tells the story, and I can be pleased knowing that this film centers around 60s mod London.  It captures many moments in history that are special.  And, the story itself justifies the hype.<br />Now, where is that DVD remaster?
B000002H2H|5.0|While not as refined as their famous follow-up, \\"Ride the Lightning\\" is still an excellent piece of metal.  Practically every song on this is great, including the fast-paced title track, my personal favorite \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\", \\"Fade to Black,\\" \\"Trapped Under Ice,\\" and \\"Creeping Death.\\"  This is still a masterpiece in its own right and holds up better than all their albums after \\"...And Justice For All.\\"  A must-have for any metalhead.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I rented this movie from Blockbuster. I wish that I had more time to watch it, though. I thoroughly enjoyed the special features of the DVD.

B00005QW5X|5.0|Hedwig is a must see, the best move ever in my book. Its a story about coming to term with yourself and maybe that the things you hold to arent exactly the way you want them or picture them to be. Everyone can relate to Hedwig on some level. EVERYONE can i promise. Hedwig is full of great songs and is in the tradition of the Rocky Horror Picture Show. Hedwig is simply the best there is when it comes to glam punk rock movies about transvette rockers from east berlin. it rocks my sock and all of my friends socks too!!!
B00005JKBC|5.0|\\"Spy Game\\" takes two longstanding genre cliches - the old-fashioned hero's Last Day On The Job, and The Renegade Agent - and manages to spin them into something new and compelling. Structured along the lines of \\"The Usual Suspects\\" with characters sitting around an office intercut with action-packed flashbacks all heading towards a stunning, revelatory climax, \\"Spy Game\\" never feels like a talk-fest even though dialogue is crucial. From the brisk opening sequence, rhythmic music well-integrated with snappy editing keeps things moving at an engaging pace. And for once we have a Brad Pitt movie in which his pretty-boy face isn't the primary focus. I actually forgot it was him I was watching. Tony Scott's direction has never been more assured, resulting in a better film than anything his more famous brother has done in quite a while. And it's good to see screenwriter Michael Frost Beckner's name on the big screen again: his last film of note was \\"Cutthroat Island\\", which just goes to show there is such a thing as life after death in Hollywood. This isn't a film for action fans - but for those who enjoy superbly crafted movies and clever yarns, \\"Spy Game\\" will be just the ticket.
B00005221M|4.0|Calling it Director's Expanded Edition is a bit of a misnomer.  It makes no sense to me why they cut a few lines here and there.  Some that I kept waiting for and never turned up.  Also the dropping of the song by Clannad was odd.  They should have deleted the credit for the song while they were at it.  I enjoyed the theatrical/VHS version of the movie immensely.  This DVD version was a let down.
B000022TSH|5.0|Chinatown is one of the great movies of the 20th century. If you need to know why, read some of the more expansive reviews on this page. Otherwise, just buy it and treasure it. Film doesn't get any better than this.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Yes! This is a great movie. I have been a big fan of Harry Potter for three years now, and I must say that the books are wonderful. The movie...<br />   The movie is good. Christopher Columbus is awesome, because he turned the book into almost exactly what I had imagined it would be. And he most definitely has good taste in actors. Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson did commendable jobs, but by far the one who stole the show was Rupert Grint, the red-headed kid who does an excellent job portraying Ron Weasley. He's definitely the primo kid. Hasta la vista!

B00006DEFA|5.0|I loved \\"Amadeus\\" from my childhood. I think it is the greatest movie of all time. However this is the first time one can see the whole uncut version of it. To be honest, I would prefer the original (the one which we all used to know). Those added episodes make the whole movie little bit long and even boring. Especially the episodes involving that family with crazy dogs. This is really unnecessary. However blackmailing scene is really wonderful, watch the great acting from both Constantsa and Salieri. They are just perfect. Besides, if not that whole scene one could wonder why there is so much hate in Constantsa at the end of the movie when she asks Salieri \\"to respect her wish and go\\".<br />This edition includes very interesting material of making the \\"Amadeus\\", Director, actors everybody's invloved in it. So at the end I recommend this movie to everybody in the world. People, this movie is as good as it gets. The best movie of all time!
B00006AW2P|3.0|A question for whomever is pocketing my fifteen bucks:  Why would I want to hear an LP recorded &quot;live&quot; on to one track in Super Audio?  Hey, don't get me wrong, the (cd portion) sound quality is much improved over the original versions.  But this is 2002, don't we deserve to have a quality mixed sound in this day and age?  What is a shame is that I am paying top dollar for a 38 year old LP that is a little over 30 minutes long.  (Heck, at least the jazz labels give us alternative versions as filler!).  The Stones, like all sixties British groups, concentrated on singles and eps for the British market.  They almost never included singles (much like the Beatles).  The American versions of all of the pre-Satantic Majesty albums are different from their English counterparts (sometimes better, sometimes not).  If you wanted to collect all of the officially released Stones songs from 1963 to 1966 material you would have to buy 8 c.d.'s, plus the three disc singles boxset, plus the two disc &quot;more hot rocks&quot;.  Thanks a whole lot for still requiring us to buy all of these, in their same outdated formats, at a jumped up price.  Thanks alot!   <br />Now that I got that off my chest... my review of the album itself:  Beginning with their first (UK) hit Fade Away, the band reveals themselves to be a bunch of middle class punks who had never been out of their hometowns before, but loved the American rock &amp; roll, blues, and r&amp;b that they had been listening to on 45's for years.  Much of the album has a primative garage feel to it.  No Stones collection is complete without Carol, Route 66, I Just Wanna Make Love to You, and Can I Get a Witness.  Great fun interpreations.  Then there are a first two Jagger/Richards originals (with words):  &quot;Little by Little&quot; &amp; &quot;Tell Me&quot;.  The first is derivative of the above mentioned covers but isn't a bad song.  &quot;Tell Me&quot; has more of a Girl-Group / Brill Street sound to it, and wouldn'tsound out of place being sung by any of the popular Mercy Beat groups of the day.  The rest of the tracks are basically filler.  So, you're going to want to hear five or so of the songs that are on here, but unavailable elsewhere.  Is that worth fifteen buck to you?  No.
B00000HYXB|2.0|A bit disapointed in this, my 1st Blind Guardian album.  After comparing reviews of several titles I decided Nightfall was the most lauded volume, and bought a copy.  A mediocre production was immediately noticeable, with buried drums, and thin guitars.  I also didn't care much for the vocals.  I'd heard these guys were the new Queen, but not so.  Ultimately, I simply didn't find any real hooks in the songs.  It's all about the music, and you can write the most profound lyrics ever, but put it with weak music and nobody will ever want to listen.  Not a bad album, but certainly not up to the hype.
B00005UEAR|2.0|Metropolis 2 was so a great album.A big dissapointment I encounter myself with after hearing this one.  The track of Disc 2 and the first song of Disc one had their highs, but thats it. I hope DT don't fall again into infinity.
B000067G3C|4.0|Step aside, ma'am, Jack Traven is boarding the bus! But unlike the other passangers, he's boarding ths bus by jumping from a speeding Jaguar, so obviously the passengers already on board believe the guy \\"is out of his mind\\". He's not, actually. He's doing that because the bus simply can't slow down. It has to stay over 50 mph or a bomb planted under it will go off, a bomb planted by an angry ex-police officer and the explosive is capable of evaporating a city block. Put this bus in the streets of urban Los Angeles and those passengers have a problem! But boy, we're in for an adrenaline rush!<br />Jan De Bont's directorial debut is a very well-told urban tale about revenge and the music by Mark Mancina (Disney's Tarzan, Con Air) and the cinematography of Andrzej Bartkowiak (Falling Down, Lethal Weapon 4) help this movie to have a very urbane look. Tall buildings, gridlock traffic, golden sunlight, the sense of city heat and the gray-layer of air pollution as the bus makes its way through the streets of L.A.<br />Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) is a former cop, who feels humiliated by his retirement plan, after protecting the citizens of Los Angeles for decades. So he sets up a plan to put innocent people in danger and ask for ransom, but that's when SWAT officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) enters the plot, as the guy who saves those hostages and almost kills Payne. But Payne isn't dead, not by a long shot. Now even more angry and with nothing to lose, he elaborates a new plan, which consists on planting a bomb on a city bus. The bomb will activate itself if the bus goes over 50 mph, and once over that speed, it can never slow down or it will blow up. So Jack Traven and a couple of his friends (Dumb & Dumber's Jeff Daniels and Terminator 2's Joe Morton) and a unwilling civilian partner (Strange Days' Glenn Plummer) start a race to foil this new plan and taking Payne out for good. But it's going to be a long, urbane, working-day morning before they can call it a day. With a bus filled with likable characters (Alan Ruck, Sandra Bullock, Beth Grant, Hawthorne James, Carlos Carrasco, David Kriegel, Daniel Villarreal, et al) you really get to care about them and with the right sensibility, you even get to worry about any possible problem they might face, but don't worry, with a little luck, Jack might just as well save the day.<br />The 5-star collection edition is a perfect opportunity to enjoy this 1994 film in all its greatness, featuring some really fun TV spots, the theatrical trailer, interviews, deleted and extended scenes (great ones, actually) and even a Billy Idol music video, among lots of other things enough to fill a city bus... pun intended, of course. This movie was followed by a weird 1997 sequel (no Keanu Reeves) but that's another story. That sequel is not near as good as this movie here and is this one the one you should check out if you're interested in having a good time, that is of course, if action is your thing.a bus filled with likable characters (Alan Ruck, Sandra Bullock, Beth Grant, Hawthorne James, Carlos Carrasco, David Kriegel, Daniel Villarreal, et al) you really get to care about them and with the right sensibility, you even get to worry about any possible problem they might face, but don't worry, with a little luck, Jack might just as well save the day.<br />The 5-star collection edition is a perfect opportunity to enjoy this 1994 film in all its greatness, featuring some really fun TV spots, the theatrical trailer, interviews, deleted and extended scenes (great ones, actually) and even a Billy Idol music video, among lots of other things enough to fill a city bus... pun intended, of course.

B00006EXDM|5.0|The Rolling Stones' early years--some of the best rock and roll you'll ever find, and here it is (well, the best of it) on two CDs.  For years, this was, in my opinion, the best Stones anthology around, simply because there were so many good hits on it.  Now that it has been remastered, the sound is even better.<br />I am a little more partial to the newest Stones anthology, Forty Licks, simply because it has more songs, yet I remain true to the original Hot Rocks album.  Buy this with the enhanced sound quality, and you'll have a whole lot of listening enjoyment to look forward to.

B00006F7S4|5.0|Just wanted to add my five stars to the above.  Simply and subtly produced, beautifully moving songs that are strong from start to finish.  I listen to this album once, then again.  Then I listen to it in my head until I return to the CD player.  For me this is a rare thing--a perfect album.  I wouldn't change a note.  Some of the &quot;Odelay&quot; crowd doesn't want to hear this side of the artist, but for my money Beck had already proven that he was a genius, and has now proven that he is also a completely different type of genius.  Amazing.  Should be nominated for Best Album of the Year in the Grammy Awards, IMHO.
B00002E233|4.0|Ok, what we have here is one of those underestimated action films. Yes, it has sharks in it but that doesn't make it comparable to Jaws. Jaws and Deep Blue Sea are quite different films, simply because the approach is different. Deep Blue Sea is about a group of scientists who work in a submarine research lab known as Aquatica, somewhere near the Mexico coast. Aquatica is usually filled with people, but during the weekends it is shut down. Not this weekend, though. The head scientists are in a hurry and they need to complete their most important experiement, which is to get a cure for Alzheimer and they claim they can get it from a protein that exists only in the brain of white sharks.<br />So we stay with the skeleton crew only: the founder of the project (Samuel L. Jackson), the chief scientist (Saffron Burrows), the tough ex-con turned into the guy who feeds and takes care of the sharks (Thomas Jane), the wise neurologist (Stellan Skarsgard), the systems engineer (Michael Rapaport), the radio woman (Aida Turturro), the executive officer nurse (Jacqueline McKenzie) and the cook (LL Cool J). They work hard all Friday to get their sharks ready for testing on Saturday night. We're talking about genetically engineered sharks, giant sharks with bigger brains so the scientists can get a larger amount of the protein they need. But they don't count on the sharks getting more intelligent than they expected. And the sharks are not interested on helping out the scientists, what they want is to get free, to get out of the cages they keep them in and escape into the deep blue sea. So in a really freaky accident, the sharks get loose, they get out of their cages and swim around the flooded Aquatica. And while the whole lab is sinking, the skeleton crew has less and less space to move and what's worse, the sharks take over more and more territory.<br />These guys need a way out, but not all of them are going to make it and even if they do make it, they also need to kill the sharks before they can escape and reproduce. Now you're in for a gory adventure, and if that's your thing, you sure are going to love this movie. All actors are great in their roles, especially watch out for Rapaport as the nerdy tech guy and Thomas Jane as the ex-con. I know Renny Harlin is the responsible for some lousy movies (Cutthroat Island, Long Kiss Goodnight) but he has been involved in great action movies as well, such as Die Hard 2 and Cliffhanger. If those two are your idea of a good action/adventure film, you might as well check this one out.<br />The DVD was released in 1999 so it's not as good as the ones that are released these days, but it is fairly good for its time. Deleted scenes, featurettes, et al. Also, if you're a movie buff, you're in for a treat with Trevor Rabin's score! Just keep in mind this movie might not be very realistic, but it's entertainment. If you're looking for realism, look somewhere else; if you're looking for fun... then Aquatica is your kind of place!ks before they can escape and reproduce.

0345357116|5.0|This collection of stories is just what the name implies--unfinished tales from both the continent of Middle-Earth and the island of Numenor.  These tales are great and rich in detail, but one should be warned that they are not your everyday fantasy story.  Both The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion are complicated and not casually understood, but this book tops both of them in terms of complexity.<br /> The story of the compilation of the book is this: Tolkien's son Christopher collected a mass of writings of his father--notes scrawled on scraps of paper, unpublished essays, even letters dealing with Middle-Earth.  He edited and organized them, and prepared them for publication, and the result is this book.  Because of this, many of the stories are missing detail and have some speculation, and all of them relate to other events related in Tolkien's other works.<br /> Because of the relation to Tolkien's other work, this book should be read AFTER The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, and The Silmarillion, and should only be approached by those who want to seriously study and learn all there is to know of the world Tolkien created.  For the casual reader this compilation may be somewhat tedious, for there is much detail lacking and it is assumed that you already have a knowledge of the history of Middle-Earth as outlined in Tolkien's other books.<br /> For those who are serious about study, though, this book is a great addition to the already extensive world of JRR Tolkien.  Ever wonder where Gandalf and the other wizards came from?  Why Bilbo was chosen to accompany the Dwarves in The Hobbit?  What the palantiri stones do, and where they came from?  If so, then this is the book for you.  You will find a collection of stories that will greatly enrich the lore of Middle-Earth (and Numenor).  <br /> For serious readers of Tolkien, this book is highly recommended.  No one does fantasy like he does, and even these scattered fragments of narrative are enough to leave you begging for more.
0679735909|3.0|Like many other people, I found the first half of the book difficult to read. I found it boring and it seemed to drag on with no sense of direction. Roland and Maud were two-dimensional to me, I didn't feel like I knew or understood the characters. I was thinking of giving up altogether, when I started the second half of the story. Things started to pick up from there - the story started coming together, things started making sense, and I actually started enjoying the book instead of just slogging through it. For those of you who don't like the poetry, or if the poetry means nothing to you, you can probably afford to skip it. I didn't read a lot of the poetry as it didn't seem to give any vital information I needed to understand the plot of the book. Do read the letters and diaries though, they contain information you need to know. I thought the ending was absolutely beautiful. So overall, the book was worth reading but the first half was hard work.
B00000K19E|4.0|Green data that moves down over the computer screen making a high-pitched electronic noise. That's the code of the matrix. You ask what is the matrix? It is a hi-tech computer capable of reproducing a physical reality to all of us, humans. Once the humans created artificial intelligence, it quickly turned against us and it started a war of man against machine. Brain against software. And since the machines get their energy form the sun, the military scorched the sky, turning it into pitch black. But the machines were clever. They didn't need the sun to survive, they just needed some sort of energy, and they found that energy on the electrical impulses of our bodies. So all humans were taken as slaves and they were put into this huge prison, where they keep humans sleeping, but dreaming about reality, a reality created by the matrix so the human brains can keep working and producing all the energy the machines need to stay alive.<br />But Thomas Anderson feels that reality is a little weird. It feels strange, he always has the feeling that he is dreaming because... he is! So that's why he's contacted by Morpheous, one of the people who's not in the Matrix. Morpheous believes Anderson is the key player to destroy the matrix and set all humans free. But before they do that, he has to convince Tom Anderson he's special and that he can do a lot more than what he believes.<br />What we have here is one of the most interesting and intelligent science fiction films of all times. Yes, I said that. I've always liked Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne, but they practically seem like they were born for these roles! And this film is quite a treat for both the eyes and the brain. I was very pleased after I watched this movie, because it's not one of those sci-fi films that use special effects just to cover its plot holes or script weakness. The Matrix uses special effects only when it's necessary and the final result is outstanding!<br />It has also one of the greatests soundtracks and scores I've heard and the whole deal about perception is something that will leave you thinking long after the final credits. If you're into sci-fi, and more especially, if you're into intelligent films, this one's for you! Also, check for Hugo Weaving's performance as Agent Smith... if that's not creepy, I don't know what is!cks and scores I've heard and the whole deal about perception is something that will leave you thinking long after the final credits.

B00004XOWM|3.0|It's a shame that Limp Bizkit has come out with this effort because all in all there not a bad band. But in this album it becomes clear why alot of people really dislike Limp Bizkit. When you first put the CD into the machine you can't help think this has to be somthing special considering 3 Doller Bill &amp; Significant Others where both great Nu Metal albums. But what you get is completly different, first it's Hotdog. It's a childish rant from Fred Durst that proberly shows he still has some growing up to do. Why on earth did he even think of the song like My Generation he's a 30 year old man writing about his Generation?. It's a moshing track nothing more. The album in all isn't that bad if once you get past the first 7 tracks after that a more mature flow seems to take over. With Limp's The One it shows another side to Limp even though it has Re-Arrangness about it. Xzibits apperence on Getcha Groove On helps out if your into Rap as it completly takes you away from the first 7 tracks and he and Fred really work well together. Now we hit Take A Look Around, It'll Be Ok, Boiler and Hold On and all of these tracks deliver. After sitting through a so far boring Nu Metal album you get some killer tracks to get you teeth into. Take A Look Around is a really good track that suits the film MI2 well, with killer riffs and phat beats thanks to the Ottoman you have a great track finished of with Fred Durst's vocal caress. The other three tracks are more emotional and take you on a trip of pain and suffering. The last two tracks are to me just guest apperence spots that contain DMX, Method Man &amp; Redman on the rollin Rap remix and Ben Stiller makes a guest apperence on Outro. All in all it's going to take a HARDCORE Limp Bizkit fan to like this plain effort like me.
B00005YJMX|5.0|Nosferatu was originally a German expressionist film, much in the style of \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Calgari. Moody, extremley gothic, and very scary, shot in Germany in 1922. Max Schreck played the part of Nosferatu, aka Count Orlok, the ugliest, scariest Dracula in cinematic history. Orlak is tall and skinny, shriveled, actually, with elongated limbs, and long, sharp claws for hands. He is ancient as well. We have no leading man type here, a la Christopher Lee, who was actually a sex symbol back in the late sixties, or handsome Bela, Frank Langella, or more recently, Gary Oldman. Orlak is the combination of an evil old man, mixed with a rodent. His ears are batlike, his eyes, wide and scary, a beak nose, and his full lips hide long, ratlike fangs. He is bald as well. Klaus Kinski captured Nosferatu to a tee, although Klaus is well, flat out not as ugly as Schrek. the story is virtually Dracula retold, including Harker's trip to Transylvania, the Count buying Real Estate, the Count lusting after Lucy, and Lucy's sacrifice. There is a hidden eroticism in the final scene with Lucy that must be seen to be believed. Lucy, by the way, is portrayed by the ever sexy Isabelle Adjani, and she portays a perfect damsel in distress, who knows what she must do. The contrast in Lucy's beauty, compared to Orlak's hideous repulsiveness, only adds to the erotic chemistry that is on the screen during their scenes together, especially when Lucy is first confronted by the lustful old vampire, and he demands her love. During the famous, final scene, we see Orlak consumate his vampiric love, in full detail. Lucy almost seems to be enjoying it. Orlak must have Lucy, even if it means that his very existance is the price to be paid, so he enjoys his night of bloodlust, and lovemaking to the fullest. The movie is atmospheric, and well acted throughout, although the Van Helsing character seems a bit powerless. Then again, aside from Lucy's sacrificial beauty, what can stop the evil Count Orlak.....Highly recommended.

B000060P79|5.0|Before buying Simple Plan's debut CD, \\"No Pads, No Helmets .. Just Balls\\", I was quite skeptical. I figured they were just the same as any other band in the pop-punk category, and figured there was nothing different about them, but I was totally wrong.<br />Anyone who picks up this CD can relate to at least one song off of it. From the fast-paced beginning track, \\"I'd Do Anything\\" to the slower song \\"Perfect\\", there will be lyrics that explain certain instances. Mostly broken-hearted songs, this CD also contains songs like \\"Meet You There\\", a song about the death of someone close, and \\"Perfect\\", a song that apologizes for not being able to live up to the way someone (in this sense, their fathers) wants you to. Also contianing \\"I'm Just A Kid\\", a song anyone who's ever felt left out can connect with.<br />Pick up this CD, in my personal opinion, it's definitely worth every penny.

B000005J56|5.0|When my wife and I got married two years ago, I brought about a dozen CDs with me to Fiji so we'd have plenty to listen to while we were there.  However, Buena Vista Social Club (a wedding present) ended up being the only CD we played.  Unlike almost any other music I have heard, this music captures the heart and communicates a fun, warm, loving mood.  The guitar and vocal combos are at once old fashioned and daring and tropical.  When you hear the singing you'll never believe that some of the band members are well into their 70s and even 80s.  On the remote and relaxed Fiji beaches, this was the only music that seemed to fit.<br />Two years later, my wife and I still listen to it frequently -- especially when we are having a festive or romantic occassion.  Many friends have now heard the CD and they also now love it... <br />This CD is a must-have -- a classic.

It is just a great adaptations that captures the exact same spitir of the novel, which I saw AFTER reading, but puts everything in a magical visual way.<BR>The only thing that I don't understand is how Ondaatje is pronounce.
0316666343|5.0|I loved this book so much!  It really made me think. I have read lots of books and none touched me the way this did.  I really recomend it to everyone.
0743216458|3.0|I had to read this for a book review in my military science class, and I was surprised at how easy this book was to read.  I was expecting something along the lines of this company did this and this company did that.  Stephen Ambrose got personal.  He relied mostly on interviews with the people who were there to write to book.  Only when giving a larger view of what was going on did he refer to histories of the war.  Ambrose gives a more personal account of the men who were in this company.  He also give a sense of the comraderie that went on - how these men literally depended on each other for their lives.  I highly recommend this book to someone who wants a history of WWII but not a confusing book with a lot of military terms and concepts.

B00004SVIK|5.0|When I was younger I was dumb enough to think there actually was a guy named &quot;Pink Floyd&quot;. I know the work is based on an ex-band member..... I lived through the music and realized the relevance. The Wall is in or around everyone's lives. Every sentence, nuance, and tone in the enitre work should reach into everyones hearts differently and either horrify you or enlighten you, or, I think the bands perogative was both. Don't read into the music - as John Lennon would say - Let the music feed you and think about it before you defecate it out of your big fat ars. The Wall changed my life. Now I know I'm not only not just the only insane person out there with my own hidden key to the walls I and the world have built - but there are millions of us. Isn't there? Is there anybody out there?
B000001GYC|2.0|The majority of Mendelssohn's works consisted of fluff and flutter reminisent of Mozart on an off-day and these piano pieces certainly aren't among Mendelssohn's small number of masterworks.The fact that these compositions are no more than trifles is made worse by Barenboim's insistence in trying to infuse an element of profundity to them.The result is tedium and annoyance.I owned this 2 disk set for more than 2 years and didn't listen to it more than 7-8 times.Every time I would try and listen boredom would set in and within a few minutes listening became a matter of endurance.I finally traded it off and haven't missed it in the least.It may be a 2 for the price of 1 set but,as usual,such &quot;bargains&quot; are hardly a bargain.
B00004SVIK|5.0|I just had to write a little more. The Wall said everything Kurt Cobain did only more fluidly and easier to breathe. The type of stuff you could listen to around your parents, who had no idea the stirrings it brought about in your soul, just like \\"Unplugged\\" in comparison to \\"Bleach\\". My Mom's like that's so pretty. I tell her the same guy was singing on the tape you just told me to shut off cause it was giving you a headache. Sometimes headaches help - any punker knows loud will quiet.<br />Anyone who has anything to discuss with me about Pink Floyd, Nirvana, The Doors, The Beatles... Please bring it on... I need a few unbrainless few...
B00003CX9E|5.0|If you have already seen &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; you don't need me to tell you to buy it. Just go ahead and put it in your shopping cart.<br />This review is for those of you who do not know about this film, and are maybe even wondering why you should care. Why do so many film critics lavish so much praise on a film made so long ago?<br />One reason is the director and star of the film, Orson Welles. Already considered to be a genius at a young age, Welles stormed Hollywood at age 25 with the clout of a man three times his age. With that power, he made a movie that defied typical storytelling techniques, invented cinematic tricks on the fly, and successfully pulled off filming an unflattering, near bio-pic of the nation's most powerful newspaper publisher, William Randolph Hearst.<br />The kind of &quot;carte-blanche&quot; given to Orson Welles at the time, was unprecedented, but now, it's unthinkable. That makes this film all the more mezmerizing because it's a fantastic film.<br />It centers around Charles Foster Kane, a larger-than-life man without the fear that stops lesser men from achieving greatness. But Kane's life is not all great, and in a series of flashbacks and flash-forwards, we see how Charles Foster Kane was both tender and loving, but ruthless and selfish just the same.<br />This is a film of immense importance in American cinema. It was Orson Welles' greatest acheivement, yet the beginning of his downfall. After all, who could possibly top a movie as good as &quot;Citizen Kane?&quot; Welles discovered that it was impossible to even try.<br />This is an important film for fans of movies, film historians, people interested in the William Randolph Hearst connection, and in the sheer drama of filmmaking. There has never been a movie like it, and there never will be. It is a film that will surprise you, no matter how many times you watch it.<br />Once again, if you have not seen it, make &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; your VERY NEXT DVD purchase. You owe it to yourself as a movie fan.to yourself as a movie fan.
B00005RYL9|5.0|Beautiful direction, a unique storyline, and an outstanding cast have always made this movie a favorite of mine. Russell Mulcahy did a fabulous job with this film, bringing viewers gorgeous scenes from Scotland, and even dredging up beauty in New York City. We follow the immortal life of Connor MacLeod, from his &quot;first&quot; life in 16th century Scotland, through the discovery of his gifts (with help from Sean Connery,) and into modern life. There are scenes in this cut which weren't in the original release, including a scene from World War II, where we discover something important about a person close to Connor. Mulcahy flashes backward and forward in time, but it's not disorienting or annoying in the slightest - he weaves the lines of the story together with amazing skill.<BR>The Queen soundtrack is outstanding, and Freddie Mercury's angelic voice singing &quot;Who Wants to Live Forever&quot; contributes a great deal to what I consider one of the most poignant moments in film, ever. <br />Clancy Brown is, naturally, a truly sinister presence throughout the movie, pulling his role off without venturing too far over the &quot;overacting his part&quot; line, which is difficult to do with such an over-the-top character. Christopher Lambert is a soft-spoken, refined tough guy, and carries himself well throughout the story.<BR>It's tragic that the second movie was such an abysmal piece of junk, but this one...this one is priceless; not to be cute, but maybe there should have been only one. The attention to detail is remarkable (they even got the MacLeod tartan right - or so it looks without reeeeeally close inspection.) Have I mentioned that this film is *beautiful*? Just checking.<br />The DVD is not overwhelming; very few extras, including Queen videos and not much else, alas. The director's cut is an interesting change from the original, but there isn't a huge amount of difference - a few things dropped, a few things added, only one of which was of remarkable interest.<br />If you haven't seen this movie, you simply must - if you have seen it, and you enjoyed it, having it around the house to throw in whenever you feel like revisiting the great story is very handy. Most recommended!
B00006CJOY|5.0|This live set, compiled from various locations over Mano Chao's recent world tour is exemplary of his sheer raw energy  and the synergistic relationship he has with his fans. If you are familiar with Mano the music here comes mostly from his second  solo release entitled  \\"Proxima Estacion:Esperanza\\" and it is killer. If you can sit without moving to this music have someone check your pusle. Beginning with the now familiar(if you've heard  his last release) time zone check, Mano leads into a zippy rendition of \\"Bienvenida A Tijuana\\" which is an appropriate calling of arms to his Radio Bemba to begin an uptempo set that has every style from slow bass thumpng reggae that morfs into ska- Latin punk- flavored rhythmns.  They move easily from song to song, including anothe version of  \\"Welcome To Tijuana.\\" The utilization of stage sound system effects folow the style of his albums including his political messages delivered via the words of EZLN leader sub commander Marcos. With 29 songs the lively set moves as fast as the  sheer energy of Mano Chao. His eclectic brand of music slows down the tempo for simmering versions of \\"Por El Suelo\\" and the memorable  backbeat \\"Mr. Bobby\\" in honor of Bob Marley that displays the singing talents of members of his Radio Bemba as they chorus in trailing into a hip-hopish delivery that smokes into a speedy frenzy. This album also covers some of his muisc from \\"Clandestino\\" and his days with Mano Negra. As stated before the vast majority is from \\" Proxima Estacion:Esperanza, \\" and the tour that has touched on several continents. Mano Chao is like a circus ring leader with his musical entourage Radio Bemba following suit and performing magic for the audience. I was lucky enough to catch these modern troubadors in Tijuana and I can say that this disc captures the essence of his live performance. If you get a chance to see them live do it, if not buy this CD for the next best thing. Recommended for old and new fans of Mano Chao, your challenge is keep from standing still while listening.nge is keep from standing still while listening.
6304884419|5.0|Closely relating to my upbringing, definetly the greatest movie of all time in my books... i have watched this movie with 5 other people and they also give it the 5star salute as well... blended with continuous suspense and drama, the mix of love and moral and ethnic standings, this epidemic is not only for viewing pleasure but is an educational account of life on the streets.
0375805613|5.0|Of my young childhood memories, \\"The Monster at the End of This Book\\" is one that I fondly recall and still enjoy reading for my daughter. When I was a little girl, I remember how much fun it was to have my mother reading to me in Grover's voice, and I hope to share that fond memory with my beautiful daughter. She is only eight months old and she already is laughing and really enjoying it with me. I like the board edition as well - it's easy to read with a young baby - you don't have to worry about the pages being torn/bent so it should stay in good condition for a while. I definitely highly recommend this book!<br />Have fun,<br />Gaby :)
0671775308|4.0|The Millionaire Next Door was a well written, organized book.  It was interesting to read about the statistics of most millionaires, and how they live there lives like non-millionaires.  However, Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko made it seem like if you follow the &quot;simple&quot; seven rules, you will become a millionaire.  If it was that easy, most of everyone would be millionaires.  Some statistics are shocking, and it's a good book.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I loved this movie. It is better than Shrek if you ask me. Shrek was funnier maybe, but Monsters, Inc. has a great plot and there isn't any dull and slow parts like some children movies can have. This is great for kids and adults. Wonderful movie. A Must see.
B00005UW7G|1.0|this dvd only gets one star for the singing (maybe 1 and a half) but because the audio is so horrible you can't hear anything. everything is jumble up...on top of that...either opera-star can't lipsync or the guy managing the audio did not know how to do his job because often times, the singers' mouth does not move with the music! VERY DISTRACTING! the background is beautiful BUT THE FILM IS JUST PLAIN UGLY! TAKE MY ADVICE AND BUY ANOTHER DON GIOVANNI --- STAY AWAY FROM THIS DISC.
B00003CXAA|5.0|The godfathers are the greatest movies ever made. If you have the time, sit and watch all three in a role over a weekend. You will not want them to end. Godfather I is excellent. Godfather II is better than the first one. Godfather III is good, but not as good as the others. However, Godfather III was set up perfect for a Part IV. It's a shame one was never made.
B00004XQ83|5.0|My sister-in-law lent me a rental video of &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou?&quot; and I approached it like any other weekly rental. A bit of fun.<br />Brothers and sisters, I have seen the light! The movie is funny, thoughtful, evocative, rooted in a classical story and full of the most wonderful music. I watched it again and again to experience the surreal sights and sounds. Who can possibly forget the sirens pouring honey into the ears of the three runaways, or the beautiful purity of the congregation &quot;Going Down to the River to Pray&quot;?<br />Lawd, Lawd! I went straight out and bought the soundtrack, where the songs are complete and the voices and music unblemished by dialogue. And I have been listening to it solid this past week. As soon as it finishes, I hit the [PLAY] button again. Downloaded some favorite tracks onto my hand-held. And sang those glorious songs over and over again.<br />The songs by themselves are great, each and every one, but the &quot;ole-timey&quot; mixture of gospel, blues and folk is just inspired. <br />The movie is wonderful, the soundtrack better. Like the awesome &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; single in the movie (and in real life), this is one record that they can't keep on the shelves.<br />I've been thanking my sister-in-law for putting me onto this. I stumbled into heaven and I've been singing her praises ever since.<br />If you've seen the movie, you want the soundtrack. Guaranteed. If you haven't seen the movie nor heard the soundtrack, then fly away and get them both. You're in for a treat.
B00006DEFA|5.0|Amadeus has been my favorite movie for years. When I moved my collection of movies from VHS to DVD, I purchased the Director's cut of the movie. I heard that the rating had been moved from rated G to R. After watching the new cut, I still do not see why it was moved to rated R. There is one sceen where Mozart's wife shows her breast. That to me does not call for a R rating. PG-13 maybe, but not R. This is crazy. This is a classic film and now some school will not be able to show it in their classrooms due to a unfair rating. This is just my option.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is a really great movie, probably the greatest cartoon movie I've seen in a while, after Toy Story 1 and 2.<BR>I love it!!!<BR>The voice of \\"boo\\" is just very cute.  I like the effects of the faces of the monster \\"Sully\\" and the one eyed monster, \\"Mike.\\"<BR>The effects are also very advanced.  You can see how \\"Sully's\\" furr moves when he walks, and the expressions on his face.<BR>This is a great movie, and shouldn't be missing in your movie collection.  I highly recommend it.
B00006HBUA|2.0|Like Maaannnn.<br /><br /> It's just awful. Poor quality sound, Even worse story line.<br /> Throw [money] to get acouple big name actors and market market  market market.<br />That's how the money is made ,quite simple(arent we?).
B00006L85B|5.0|These are Luis Miguel's favorite Boleros, from his previous Bolero albums. The selection is excellent, and for those who enjoy video clips,you have been treated with very special collection of Luis Miguel's finest. So invite someone to watch and listen while he/she falls in love with you! Even if you are not a Luis Miguel fan, these are some of the greatest Spanish Language songs that you can get.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I never read the Harry Potter series, so I didn't know what to expect when I began watching the movie. It was great and a highly imaginative story. The graphics were great and I definately enjoyed navigating through the DVD's special features! I would definately recommend this movie for children and for adults as well. Definately not a disappointing movie.
B000068TPN|5.0|This was few points , I didn't like : The copters was too low ... No supporting fighter copters during the landing ... they landed in lower point , most defenseless sight ...the people in copters was too open ( You have to sit ON the top  your helmet ) ...

B00003CX8Y|5.0|The documentary segment dedicated to Howard Ashman, as well as the entire movie's dedication to Howard Ashman in the film's credits are commendable and touching.  Thank you to Disney.  I was truly moved.

B000002BQK|4.0|this album seemed to unjustly start Mariah's commercial downward spiral. In all reality, it's a great album and was a nice chance for her to experiment. Although she flirted with R&amp;B on &quot;Daydream&quot; *hence the ODB &quot;Fantasty remix*, she didn't start to go head-on until &quot;Butterfly.&quot; The first single &quot;Honey&quot; featured the new emancipated Mariah in a skimpy bikini diving into pools and frolicing on a ship with a bunch of sailors. The single is good, but not one of Mariah's best. Still, it went to #1. The album's title track was a moderate radio hit and has an awesome message. Great song. Then we have the sweeping ballad &quot;My All&quot; which was another #1 hit. &quot;Breakdown&quot; was a minor hit also and is a good R&amp;B song. The highlight of the CD has to be &quot;Whenever You Call.&quot; This is the original version without Brian McKnight which was featured on &quot;#1's.&quot; I like the original more anyways and would rather hear it without McKnight. The rest of the songs are so-so. &quot;4th of July&quot; is a nice little light-hearted song, but other than that....<br />Overall, good album, but Mariah should've moved on from it instead of trying to duplicate it with &quot;Rainbow.&quot; Still, if you wanna experience the true power of Mariah I recommend her debut and the &quot;Daydream&quot; album. Some of the best music of the 90's.
B00005YUPO|5.0|We received a Baby Mozart VHS tape for a shower present. I didn't think we'd use it right away.  When our daughter was 3 weeks, he popped it in and she loved it! We immediately bought the Baby Bach DVD.  BUY DVDs! They have additional features like (repeat play), so you don't need to rewind a tape to keep baby entertained!  My daughter is now 8 months old and still watches her Baby Einstein DVDs on a regular basis.  When she's fussy from teething, we put her in front of the TV and \\"Baby Bach\\" her.  She's content and mommy and daddy can recharge our batteries!  They say it's bad for babies to watch TV so young, but the Baby Einstein company stimulates babies - it's good for them!
B00006AFUR|5.0|without any doubt one of the best (if not THE best) album of 2002. 30STM are just amazing!<br />nothing else to say, except, give it a listen, if you like it buy it! i'm sure you will.
B00005JL2O|5.0|YEAH BABY!!!!  Austin Powers is back, and as funny as ever.  This movie features non-stop laughs that will have you rolling on the floor.  I swear, what they said is right about how it has more laughs in one minute than some whole films (Zoolander!).  Okay, I'll admit that the story is pretty nonexistant (there is some nonsense about a satellite and a meteor), but we don't go to Austin Powers movies for the plot, we go for the jokes, and this one has some killers.  I especially enjoyed the opening credits scene with all the celebrity cameos.  Dr. Evil (my hero) is funnier than ever, though its Mini-Me who really steals the show.  Fat Bastard, while crude and gross, has his share of laughs.  But we can't forget Austin himself, now with his father Nigel.  Go see this movie if you want to laugh without having to use your brain for an hour and a half.  You'll love it.
B00006690F|5.0|Eminem releases his third record with a vengeance.  This record is a great example of evolution of an artist.  I, by no stretch of the imagination, am a rap fan, but this album is infectious.  His music started as almost a novelty and has evolved into an amazing, remarkably clever body of work.  His records have improved almost exponentially.  <br />\\"White America,\\" an edgy, angry attack on all of those who attack free speech, is the opening music track, and it sets the mood for the album.  \\"Business\\" is a fun and lively shot at the record industry and the players in it.  \\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\" is an attempt to talk about his problems with his mother. (however many times she has sued him) . . .  I could go on and on, track for track, but all I would say is that this is the strongest work Eminem has released to date.  Dr. Dre shows up now and again on the album and never disappoints.  D12 shows up on a couple, and the ones they do, are better than most of the stuff on their own release. And of course, Nate Dogg, makes his staple appearance.  But, he does show up on the best song on the album.<br />Eminem grows up a lot on this record.  He moves away from the utter vulgarity that made his name.  (not to say that this record isn't vulgar).  He gets political.  He makes reference to current events. . He shows that he is the premier act on the market.  An A+, Five Star, Two Thumbs Up, kind of record.
6305127689|5.0|There is no real explanation as to why this film is so good. The acting is not spectacular. Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis are two of the main characters while Val Kilmer and Meg Ryan play their minor roles well but are not phenomenal. The soundtrack to this film is awesome: Take my breath away, Danger Zone, and Great Balls of fire are the highlight tracks. Perhaps the aspect of the film which makes it so special is the fact that while &quot;Days of Thunder,&quot; had awesome shots within the racecar, &quot;Top Gun&quot; has hands down the best shots ever within a fighter plane. The dogfights are spectacular. Another aspect of the film that makes it so good is the story itself. A hotshot fighter pilot Maverick is sent to the top flight school in the world where he has to learn to control his flying. There he meets the love interest and the story really takes place. It's one of those great friday night movies. The plot is good and there is some great action. I wholeheartedly recommend it.
B00006AFUR|2.0|A lot of reviewers are saying that it's a great album and that everyone should like it, but I don't get it.  I bought the album out of curiosity and the fact that the genre 'space rock' was used in the title which I do find to be a nice and good genre to go with because they effectively create a mood.  The only effect that the album had on me was that I had a cold indifference to it. It's not a 'space rock' album, it's a dark, futuristic concept album about living on mars. What doesn't help the album is the fact that it's not very diverse and sounds as if the band is into the pristine sound practice of using pro tools for the production. This choice does create a futuristic effect, but at an artistic price because it mutes the possible vulnerability of the music and the weight of the music is on the shoulders of the singer and he doesn't mix it up very well.  I'm not a big fan of hard music anyway, but in the hard music that I do like, I find that there's a diversity.  The hardness of the music and the emotion of the sound in conjunction with the lyrics make different impressions.  The music portrays the harshness and the lyrics portray the grief, or happiness, or whatever. This album doesn't work because the music and lyrics create the same kind of feeling, cold harshness. You could listen to the music and not listen to the lyrics and get about as much and vice versa.  It makes for a boring listen to a casual listener and frustration for a in depth listener.
B00004ZB9D|4.0|This wasn't supposed to happen, but, somehow, it did.  In the early stages of his career, Lenny Kravitz took catty blows from critics who dismissed the talented musician as an unabashed plagarist, ripping off heavyweights including (but certainly not limited to) Hendrix, Lennon, and James Brown.  But while nobody will exactly give him points for originality, there's no denying his stage presence, raw energy, and his genuine love for rock and roll.  Over a dozen years since his debut, Kravitz still stands tall as a resilient force in music.  His persistence must have paid off; how else to explain the platinum discs and sold-out venues?  This hits collection is a one-stop guide to his musical output, featuring gems like the pyschedelic madness of &quot;Are You Gonna Go My Way,&quot; the funkified breakup jam &quot;It Ain't Over Til It's Over,&quot; and the Lennon-istic &quot;Let Love Rule.&quot;  Other jams of note are the sincere &quot;I Belong to You,&quot; the radio-friendly &quot;Fly Away,&quot; and &quot;Stand By My Woman.&quot;  I, personally, would have like to have seen &quot;If You Can't Say No&quot; from his &quot;5&quot; album, but you can't have it all, I suppose.  &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; is a pretty decent collection that does this rocker justice.  Here's looking at Volume 2.
B00005JKL8|1.0|A stupid, hot-shot wannabe, selfish wimpish little navigator who is bored with his job (Aw!) manages to get his pilot (and friend) killed, his CO to lose his job, put more innocent civilians in Bosnia at risk, destroy a multi-million dollar jet-fighter after having deliberately disobeyed a direct order NOt to fly into a demilitarized zone, and this guy comes home to a hero's welcome? Shouldn't that be a court-martial? What sort of image is the US military trying to portray?<br />I thought Ben Affleck was a bad actor, but having seen Owen what's his name (you see how memorable he was?) I have had to change my opinion... What he did in this movie cannot even be called acting! Not only that, but what a strange face to choose for a Hollywood action hero? I know people can't help the way they look, but apart from the nose, there's his constant smirk which makes anything that happens in the film even less believeble. The only good thing about this was Gene Hackmann. Don't even bother with this movie - it's terrible!
B00003CXB4|5.0|The Lion King is still today the best Disney movie ever made. Although Disney has tried to have repeat success with Lilo and Stitch and Atlantis: The Lost Empire, none of them can compare to this remarkable movie! The film opens into the amazing musical sequence \\"The Circle of Life\\", when young Simba is born. Him and his best friend Nala escape off into the outlands where the Pride Lands' enemies, the hyenas, await them. As they make a daring escape, Simba's evil uncle, Scar, is making a plan to take over the kingdom. Simba winds up running away to escape his father's mysterious death, which he thinks is his fault. He runs away and meets a lovable meerkat, Timon, and a funny but stupid warthog, Pumbaa. As he grows up, he meets his old best friend, Nala. When Simba makes his way back home to the Pride Lands, he is challenged to a fight with his uncle Scar. The climax of the movie begins as Simba takes his place as the one true king. With 5 award winning songs written by Elton John and Tim Rice, and tons of funny and lovable characters, The Lion King is still today the most majestic and stunning movie that Disney fans have ever seen. As it prepares for its IMAX release and Platinum Edition DVD release, it also prepares for another generation to laugh, cry, and enjoy The Lion King.
B000065U1N|4.0|Great movie, you all covered the reasons why.  But one of you said there really isnt a performance to pick out of the bunch.   I beg to differ: as usual, Tom Sizemore steals the screen and makes another great performance, easily the most talented actor cast in this film as Colonel McKnight.  Bar none, a great underrated actor of today.  When they aren't showing footage of the convoy, you will find yourself yearning to get back to the convoy, and get back with Sizemore.  Every film he's in, you feel comfortable when he's onscreen.  That's a good actor.   By the way, the book does the same thing.  You yearn to get back to the convoy with Colonel McKnight.  That's why Tom Sizemore is a great actor.  Very few have this gift, to mention a couple: Robert DeNiro, and James Gandolfini.
0786868694|5.0|I am such a hard-core Nigella fan that when I found out that I was going on a trip to the UK last summer and that Nigella had a new cookbook out over there, I knew I HAD to have it so I hunted it down. It took days of searching but I finally found got a copy from Clarissa Dickson Wright's Cook's Bookshop in Edinburgh. They actually ordered me a copy. I am eternally grateful. I spent the whole six-hour flight home reading it and practically memorizing the recipes. I am beyond thrilled with it and I know you will be too.

B000002U9Y|5.0|A Saucerful of Secrets is many things, but it is not uneven.<br />Pink Floyd wouldn't equal this one until Atom Heart Mother.  It has Rick Wright's best song (the playful &quot;Remember A Day&quot;), Syd Barrett's best Pink Floyd song (the sorrowful &quot;Jugband Blues&quot;), Roger Waters' first great song (the meditative &quot;Set The Controls For The Heart of the Sun&quot;) a powerful organ on the title track, cool riffs and vocals on &quot;Let There Be More Light&quot; and &quot;Corporal Clegg,&quot; and a second Wright gem (&quot;See-Saw&quot;).<br />All in all, there is not a bad track here.  Not only that, there isn't a track that isn't VERY good.<br />Many Pink Floyd fans won't like Saucerful of Secrets because they dig the band for concept albums and self-important lyrics and such.  Fortunately or not, you won't find either of those here.  Only seven good, separate tracks.
0375823360|5.0|Finally you poor Americans get to see PP's lovely illustrations (and the quotes he chose for TAS). Good aren't they? Oh, apart from that one of Stelmaria for chapter 21 of Northern Lights/The Golden Compass. That's rubbish.<br />I quite envy you these covers actually, they're really nice...
0440234743|5.0|The book was great.  It is my favorite of Grisham's, and I have read them all.  I read a sweet message between the lines.
B00006690F|5.0|Even though Eminem has evolved majorly on this album from the previous ones, i think that \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" was his best work. Many songs on this album, however, give the MMLP some heavy competiton, below i have wrote a list of each song, the number of stars i gave it (1-5), and my opion of the song:<br />1. Curtains Up (skit) - i can't really give it any stars because its just the intro where Eminem's walking up on stage.<br />2. White America (5/5) - great song, probably the most contriversal on the album. The video is good as well.<br />3. Business (1/5) - i hate this song, it's awful!<br />4. Cleaning Out My Closet (4/5) - it was good the first few times i heard it, but the radio and tv wore it out. I didn't really like the video that much, either.<br />5. Square Dance (3/5) - average Eminem. Good beat and alright lyrics don't hurt either.<br />6. The Kiss (skit) (5/5) - good portrail of Em catching his wife kissing another man, blends in great with the next song as well.<br />7. Soldier (4/5) - great Eminem track with some pretty personal lyrics in it.<br />8. Say Goodbye Hollywood (1/5) - i didn't care for this one at all.<br />9. Drips (w/ Obie Trice) (2/5) - would've gave it 1/5 but Obie makes it a little better.<br />10. Without Me (0/5) - OK, now i know it's a fun little pop song that has pretty good lyrics but come on, i never want to hear this song again, i went to such extreme measures as burning the cd without this track just so i won't have to hear it ever again! It's been the same way since his first album, \\"My Name Is\\" just was annoyning after the first 2 million times i heard it, \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" made me sick after the first hundred or so hearings, and this is just awful! My advice to Eminem in this section is: KEEP YOUR AIRPLAY TO A MINIMUM OR DON'T EVER MAKE ONE OF THESE POP SONGS AGAIN!<br />11. Paul Rosenburg - just an answering machine message from Paul Rosenburg, i didn't give it any stars.<br />12. Sing For The Moment (2/5) - didn't really like it.<br />13. Superman (3/5) - a bit better than the last, but not that good, either.<br />14. Halie's Song (5/5) - Great track, the most personal on the album (besides \\"Cleaning Out My Closet\\"), and it's just hilarious hearing Eminem attempt to sing.<br />15. Steve Berman (skit) (4/5) - the occasional Steve Berman skit where Em goes in and Steve tells him off, didn't like this one that much, though, cause Em ends up shooting Steve.<br />16. When The Music Stops (1/5) - i really don't like this one at all.<br />17. Say What You Say (5/5) - My favorite on the album, i love the beat and Dr. Dre and Em lyrically ... that midget JD, as well as his ... prodeage Lil' Bow Wow.<br />18. 'Till I Collapse (w/ Nate Dogg) (5/5) - great track, Nate really brings it out as a good track.<br />19. My Dad's Gone Crazy (5/5) - the funniest on the album, i love the beat and Em raps awesomely in between his daughter Haile's chorus.<br />20. Curtains Close (skit) - can't really say anything about it, although, it is supposed to be the third installment of the Ken Kaniff skits found on all the other Eminem albums.<br />
B00005JKJA|3.0|I love getting caught up in the dreamlike scenes &amp; sequences David Lynch puts together, and I love getting intrigued by all the juxtapositions and surprise turns.<BR>I hate that he doesn't seem to know how to handle &quot;ending&quot; what he starts.<BR>Just as he did in Twin Peaks, when he has used up the energy and impetus of adding layers of complexity to the story, he puts in a scene involving an out-of-nowhere character doing strange things in front of a red curtain... and then just lets all the loose ends fall where they may.<BR>Frustrates me so much, because I get so entranced by his beginnings and middles...     I can't help but make comparisons to films like &quot;Memento&quot; and &quot;Lantana&quot; and (to a certain extent) &quot;Magnolia&quot;, where the many different strands of the experience are brought brilliantly to an integral completion by film's end. I would find Lynch absolutely brilliant if he could figure out how to carry through all the way with the multiple fascinating strands he sets in motion. But so far he can't.
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie is incredible! THE MUSIC IS INCREDIBLE! THE ACTION IS UNBELIAVABLE!AND THE MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BEST EVER!! I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE MATRIX II TO BE RELEASED IN THEATERS!!I TRULY RECOMMEND THIS FOR AN MOVIE FAN!!
B00006F7S4|5.0|I was so excited when Midnite Vultures was released. Mutations replaced One Foot in the Grave as my favorite Beck album, and I was elated that he dropped his rap influence in favor of a more melodic approach. Then I heard Midnite Vultures, and my opinion of Beck abruptly changed from incredible to questionable.<br />When my friend told me about Sea Change, I was indifferent. Unlike Vultures, I was going to give this one a listen before I decide if it's worth my [money]. And I did. And it was good.<br />Sea Change is oft compared to Mutations, and rightfully so. Each song sounds simple, but upon closer listening, one can hear layers upon layers of instruments, sounds, noises, etc. However, Sea Change is much sadder and somber than Mutations.<br />There are three major highlights of Sea Change. Lonesome Tears starts quiet, but gradually involves more strings until the final rousing end. Lost Cause is probably the most accessible of the album. However, the best track is easily Sunday Sun, which any description I try to give it just won't do it justice other than it just may possibly be the best song of 2002.<br />The only track that may possibly bring the album down is It's All in Your Mind, but longtime hardcore Beck fans will appreciate this decade old remake.<br />Essentially, if you loved Mutations, waste no time in getting Sea Change. If you prefer Beck's more hip-hop driven alter ego, maybe you should find an mp3 or two to listen to before you buy.<br />Lastly, Sea Change also gets my vote for Best Song Entitled \\"Paper Tiger\\" in 2002, just edging out Spoon's Paper Tiger off of Kill the Moonlight.
0446677450|3.0|Yeah, this was a good book. Why three stars? 1 - The grammar didn't seem all that great, and while I'm not a grade A English student, it seems to make the advice go down in credability in my own mind. It also seemed to take him a while to make his point, and once he did he repeated the point constantly. It got a bit annoying after a while. 2 - I have never enjoyed reading about money, and this along with my Economics class seem to go straight over my head. OK, well maybe that's not exactly true. I did learn a lot from this book (AND from my Economics class, don't fail me Mr. _ _ _ _ _ _ _!!) such as the differences between assets and liabilities, and even before I heard the common misconception that your house is an asset, I had already learned that it was untrue. I learned how important it is to build that asset column. I found it interesting that it was very important to keep your emotions under control when trying to get money, otherwise you'll just give in too easily and will get trampled in the rat race. I seriously doubt that I'll be starting my own business (seeing's how I have no money-making ideas), but this book does have some good advice. And it's true, they don't teach you this stuff in school, unless your Economics teacher makes you read this book. So aside from my original problems with this book, if you are looking for advice on how to get a good solid economic base, then you will enjoy this book much more than I did.
0345448898|5.0|After I finished Sweep #14 I was on the book rebound.  I was wondering around (literaly) without an aim.  My friend recomended me this book (normally I wouldnt take him seriously) but I had seen the Amber Spyglass in stores before.  So I bought the first book (The gold compass) and read it.  It was good, but I was out of cash...so I borrowed the second one from him.  I just finished it an hour ago..and if he dosent give me the third book on Monday, I might just have to hurt him....just kidding!!
B000054OXU|4.0|How can you not like this album? This is experimental Neil at his best, trying to tackle something new and infuse it with his own Neilness. <br />So, you think of the 80s, and you think of synthesizers. New Wave? Synth pop?<br />Neil puts together this album that is largely synthesizer-driven. Actually, that's not true. This album is primarily driven by Steve Jordan's drums, mic'd in such a way that it sounds like you're in a closet with them. Keyboards are layered on top of the drums, and last... BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST... Neil's trademark tortured distorted guitar periodically cuts through and slaps you senseless.<br />This album has a LOT of charm to it.<br />Lyrically:<BR>\\"Take my advice, don't listen to me...\\"<BR>\\"The wooden ships were just a hippie dream...\\"<BR>An angelic-voiced boys choir singing \\"Got to fight to control the violent side...\\"<br />Samples & sound effects:<BR>Breaking glass as percussion.<BR>Screams punctuating that song \\"Pressure\\".<BR>...and DAMN I don't know what they did to those drums throughout the album to make 'em sound so in-your-face, but... DAMN...<br />DAMN.
B00006HBUC|1.0|Too stupid for adults, and definitely not for young children. Too many dope-smoking references, and when fred and daphne switch bodies fred (who is now inside dapne's body) looks down his (her) shirt and says &quot;Wow, now I can look at myself naked&quot;. Shaggy and scooby were the only characters who resembled the cartoon. All the others have some sort of interpersonal battle or social problem. Don't waste your time. This was just plain dumb.
0446677450|5.0|I think this book, needs to be taught in schools because it has  diffrent looks on life from both points of view as a working person and a person who has people workin for them. It gives kids the chance to learn something DIFFRENT.
0446677450|5.0|Well if anyone has read this good I give you props, B/C this book is very good. I must say this book should be given to young teenagers and adults, it can be very helpful to you. There are some very wealthy men in our society which did not go threw the whole school ceremony. You need to learn how to work the money so then it just comes too you,  learning how to be a success you must start by working for  no charge and learning how the system works. So......... read this book ok I recommend it.
0446677450|4.0|this is a good book. at times it can be repetitive, but it is just trying to drive the point home. overall, it can be very eduacational if taken the right why. reading this book makes it seem very simple to make lots of money. but there is no real way to know unless you try it. i liked this book, but i personally wouldn't completely follow all of his advice. i would definately recommend following some of it, but while still keeping your day job.
B00006AG5N|5.0|If it worked for The Beatles and their &quot;1&quot; collection, surely it can work for Elvis Presley, too. And it has---&quot;30 #1 Hits&quot; has returned The King to the top of the album charts, and with darn good reason. For the casual Elvis fan, this CD is quite possibly the only Elvis disc you'll ever need to own, as it's got ALL of his best-known, best-loved tunes on it (&quot;Don't Be Cruel,&quot; &quot;Hound Dog,&quot; &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;...heck, ALL of the big hits). For the diehard Elvis followers who already own everything, this CD is worth getting alone for the inclusion of Elvis' latest smash hit, the muscular &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot; (a UK #1 from this past summer). &quot;30 #1 Hits&quot; is grand proof why The King Of Rock 'N' Roll is here to stay. Elvis lives! :-)
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool is my favorite band. I just started to listen to them in the last few years and i own all theyre cds. But the best one always will be Aenima unless they come out with a new cd then maybe there might be something better. NOthing can compare to Tools Aenima. The songs i think are the best are Third Eye, Jimmy and 40 6 and two. This Cd also has to be the funniest they came out with. the one i found the most heart stopping funny is Die Eier Von Satan. I thought it was some kinda evil thing when i first heard it but when i heard the translation I just started laughing. Well this is the best!!!
B00005JL7Q|5.0|Who knew the guys who made American Pie could also direct something as thoughtful and smart as About a Boy? In many ways superior to the still really awesome book, Hugh Grant turns in his most nuanced performace as Will, the selfish protagonist. The use of Badly Drawn Boy's score excellently punctuates a funny yet realistic script. Not to be missed!
0345339711|5.0|The Two Towers by J.R.R. Tolkien is an epic tale about two courageous hobbits.  Their fate separates them from the rest of the Fellowship when attacked by a group of orcs.  In the attack, Boromir is slain and the hobbits Pippin and Merry are taken captive.  The other two hobbits, Frodo the ring bearer and Samwise his trusty servant, leave during the attack on a quest to destroy the evil Ring of Power in the feared land of Mordor. The remaining members of the fellowship Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli begin their chase of the orcs to save the captured Pippin and Merry.  While Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli were hunting the orcs, Frodo and Sam find an unlikely guide who takes them to the gates of Mordor and beyond. Frodo and Sam meet untold perils on their trek to the gates of Mordor.  Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legalos, and Gimli take part in an epic battle that leads to a turning point in the war against Sauron, and begins Pippin and Merry on their road to fame and glory.<BR>    I recommend this book to people who like action, drama and fantsy.  Before you read this book you should read two other books written by J.R.R. Tolkien.  These are \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", the prologue and first book in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, respectively.  These books are all very good books and are definitely worth your time.
B000002AEN|5.0|I don't know what I can possibly add to the other reviews here, except to say that this is one of those albums that MUST be included in any blues (acoustic or otherwise) collection. Hurt's finger-picking style is unique and his lyrical approach is irresistible--you just have to hum along and tap those feet. Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!
B000068TPN|5.0|Essentially, this is the high budget version of Siege at Firebase Gloria (except Siege at Firebase Gloria doesn't have all the fluff &amp; boring parts that We Were Soldiers has).  I absolutey loved this movie!  If you like to see thirld world country people being machine gunned, blasted with artillery, and napalmed, then this movie is for you.  The helicopter gunship scene near the end of the movie it worth the price of the DVD alone.  The special effects in this movie are absolutely fantastic, as the second half of the movie is nonstop action.
6300271145|5.0|This film tells us the story of the last years of Saxophonist Dale Turner. He is killing himself little by little with alcohol, though he has retained his music. He is under the strict surveillance from a woman, Buttercup, who locks him up to prevent him from running away to a bar. He is regenerated by a fan of his, a French graphic artist who takes him to his home, and his young daughter and integrates him in his family. Dale promises to stop drinking and he does. He recaptures his capability to compose music and finds a new life and youth in this late period of his life. He goes back to New York where he is received very favorably, but he can't stay there because New York is full of bad recollections and he feels it lacks some human atmosphere. So he goes back to Paris but life is never forever and he passes away one night, just like going to sleep a little bit too long. A very sensitive and emotional film in many ways. Tavernier directs it with tact and taste. The Paris of the 50s-60s is perfectly recreated, without its cars and with people in the streets that care for what is happening around them. He avoids emotions for the sake of emotions and builds up some deeply thought and felt situations. It is a lesson in generosity, respect and love for music.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan
B000000W5P|5.0|i recently bought up most of the stones remastered albums, and this is easily my favorite. although all the cuts are delicious by themselves (especially the lyrical \\"miss you,\\" the satirical \\"girl with faraway eyes,\\" and the funky \\"scattered\\"), what grabs me about this disk is the amazingly vibrant rock & roll energy and the way it captures the feelings of love on the cusp -- love about to go bad, love about to come true, and love in a city that's bigger than you. \\"look at me, i'm in tatters!\\" might well be the motto ... this is the stones at their peak.
B000068TPN|5.0|Great movie, but it should have been longer. To many important parts were cut. Anyone that sees the movie, should read the book. It makes it even better.
B00005JKDR|4.0|2001 was a banner year for Computer Animated film.  \\"Final Fantasy\\", \\"Shrek\\", \\"Monster's Inc.\\" and \\"Jimmy Nuetron\\" made the year a feast for the eyes.  But where \\"Final Fantasy\\" was all looks and no story, and \\"Shrek\\" was shallow fluff that will be forgotten in a year, \\"Monsters Inc\\" Continues Pixars string of success going back to the original \\"Toy Story\\"<br />The story itself is a great invention.  Monsters are real, and live in their own little world, needing the sceams of young children to power it.  A clever premise that plays off the Monster in the Closet stories from our younger days.  John Goodman voices Sully, the top scarer at Monsters Inc, the company that bridges the gap between the human and monster world and collects the screams that power Monsteropolis.  Billy Crystal, doing his best work in ages, voices the films mail comic relief, Sully's partner and best friend, the one-eyed, self-involved Mike Wazowski.  The plot revolves around how a human child, named \\"Boo\\" by Sully, gets into the Monster world and turns it upside down, Sully and Mikes attepmts to get her back to Earth, and a smart subplot about an insidous plan to end the \\"scream shortage\\" in Monsteropolis by kidnapping children and litterally sucking the screams out of them.<br />The movie is faced-paced and very funny.  It remains original while paying homage, through a series of in-jokes\\" to great monster films of the past.  It is also a great story for children, as it teaches important messages about friendship, avoiding sterotypes, and even ethics.  Where \\"Shrek\\" was a mostly cynical spin on fairy tales that went for cheap laughs and had a mixed message about true beauty, \\"Monsters Inc\\" is a lovely tale that is funny for both children and adults.  It's another home run from the folks at Pixar.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I went into Moulin Rouge skeptical.  I am not a fan of Luhrmann's \\"Romeo + Juliet\\", and musicals aren't my thing.  That being said, this film was an utterly intoxicating piece of filmmaking that had few equals in 2001.<br />Director Luhrmann decided to reconstruct the classic Hollywood Musical in his own unique way, and succeeded briliiantly.  The script is funny and heartfelt, and the characters unique.  The two leads, Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, give two of the best performances of their careers, especially Kidman, who shines as star/courtesan Satine.  McGregor also stretches his acting muscles, more so than in any film since \\"Trainspotting\\".  Their performances achor the film, but the supporting cast is briliant as well.  John Leguizamo goes aganist type and is exceedingly funny as Toulouse.  Jim Broadbent epitimizes the master showman as nightclub owner Harry Zidler.  And Richard Roxburgh, who I'd only seen in the awful \\"MI:2\\", oozes evil as the Duke, who wants to have Satine all too himself.<br />The camera is constantly on the move in this film, but that is actually in it's favor.  The opening half hour is so amazing that you have to watch the DVD to see how they pulled it off to really appreciate it.  It's truly inspired.  As for the music, the highlights include a hilarious version of \\"Like a Version\\", a pull-out-the-stops rendition of \\"Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend\\", and a great love medly.  All of these are filmed tounge in cheek, a challange to future filmmakers to top the extravagance without losing the substance.  All in all, this film is a must own for a DVD enthusiast, as the Two-Disc set shows how the film got made, and includes great featurettes and a good commentary from Director Luhrmann and his cinematographer.  Get this one on disc, it's worth it.
6305090564|3.0|Ah, Treat Williams!  He's America's greatest action hero, from his role in this film to his role in the many \\"Substitute\\" sequels, he's solidified his inheretence of \\"Greatest Action Star\\" from Van Damme and Jeff Speakman.<br />In \\"Deep Rising\\", a hilariously cheesy, surprisingly effective action thriller, Williams plays John Finnegan, a freelance speedboat operator with a devil may care attitude.  He won't ask questions about his charters, which is how he finds himself and his crew, consisting of Kevin J. O'Conner as the comic relief mechanic and Una Damon as his plucky, soon-to-be eaten co-pilot, carrying a rogues gallery of mercenaries to an unknown spot in the South China Sea.  The merc's goal: Hijack the most fantasteristific ocean liner and take a whole lot of money from the ultra-rich passengers.<br />Throwing a wrench into the plan is a gigantic sea creature which decides to invade the ship before they get there and eats everybody onboard.  No, I swear, that's what happens.  What follows is basically an \\"Alien\\" [copy]with a good sense of it's own inherent badness.  Famke Jansen joins the gang as a jewel thief who survives the inital sea monster attack.  Rounding out the rag-tag group of survivors is supreme slime-ball Anthony Heald(Dr. Chilton in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\") as the nefarious builder/owner of the luxury liner.  It's all good folks, from cheesy one-liners to some rather sectacular action set pieces.  The film was written and directed by Stephen Sommers, who would go on to make the \\"Mummy\\" films, which...aren't nearly as entertaining as this cheesball.  Give into the power of Treat Williams.  See this movie.  Your life will be altered in a good way.
B00005JKQZ|2.0|The praise heaped onto \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" befuddles me. This film, who's only redeeming quality is Russell Crowe's marvelous performance(Say what you want about the man's personal life, you cannot deny that he can act), is dull and lifeless. In fact, without that performance, the film is little better than a TV movie of the week.<br />The story, following the life of Mathmatician John Nash, is plagued by the dull pacing and scant charachterization that only Akiva Goldsman, the writer of such classics as \\"Lost in Space\\" and \\"Batman & Robin\\", can provide. Only the Nash charachter is given any insight, as Jennifer Connelley's charachter, Nash's wife Alicia, is little more than a cipher, her reasons for loving Nash never explained, as Nash appears downright unlovable. I would say that her winning an Oscar for this and Crowe's being passed over is akin to Kim Basinger winning for \\"LA Confidential\\" and Crowe not even being nominated, except that \\"Confidential\\" was so much better a film, that the comparison would be insulting.<br />The direction is standard Ron Howard, which is to say workmanlike, hetting the job done, with few stylistic flashes, and not much else. He fails to elicit much from any actor besides Crowe, and since Crowe has publicly said that Opie let him \\"be himself\\"(read: let him do whatever he wanted), the director deserves little of teh credut he gets. Make no mistake, I like most of Ron Howards movies, but have never considered them Oscar Worthy, with the exception of Apollo 13, which was had a superior script and superior actors.<br />The biggest problem with the story is in how Nash overcomes his mental problems. He goes, in a montage, from being a paranoid to a nobel winner without any explination for his progress besides \\"love\\". Cute, but it doesn't wash. There is much to Nash's battle with his demons to be praised, but the movie glosses over the \\"how\\" so that it can show you how great what he did was. If only they showed how he did it.<br />In the end, Crowe was the only one worthy of an award for this film. Everything else is plain and uninvolving. It is an average film at best, and without Crowe, wouldn't have won a single award, or have been noticed at all. Too bad he picked the role.end, Crowe was the only one worthy of an award for this film. Everything else is plain and uninvolving.

B00005JK8K|1.0|I came into this film with high expectations.  John Woo is one of my favorite directors, and he was re-teaming with the man he got the best performance out of in all of his American films, Nic Cage in \\"Face/Off\\".  Add that to my love of war films, and I thought this would be a winner.<br />Sadly, the film dissapoints on nearly every level.  The opening, showing Cage leading a doomed patrol, looks like it was filmed on a soundstage, and is so poorly acted and shot that I had to wonder if Woo had somehow turned the reigns over to Joel Schumaker.  Anyway, back to the story.<br />Cage recovers, and eventually is assigned to protect a \\"codetalker\\", a Navajo Indian who's language has been used by the Marines as a code that the Japaneses cannot break.  Cage's orders:protect the code at all costs, even if it means killing his comrade in arms if he is in danger of being captured.  Cage's codetalker, Ben Yahzee, is amiably played by Adam Beach, and the most interesting parts of trhe story are how Yahzee and his fellow Navajo are trained and how they interact with those who are assigned to protect them.  Sadly, not much of this interaction is shown, as Woo goes so far over the top in the battle scenes, both in scale and level of heroics, that you have to wonder if six people took down the Japanese all by themselves against incredible odds.<br />Other negatives include the cliched \\"Minority soldier challenged by racist comrade\\" subplot, that is resolved just as predictably as you might think.  The score is also way over the top, with James Horner seeming to forget all the lessons he learned from his Star Trek scoring to his work on Titanic.  In all the film is John Woo's worst, worse even than \\"Mission: Impossible 2\\", which is hard to top.  I worry about Woo now, as he's only made two entertaining American films, \\"Face/Off\\" & \\"Hard Target(For Van Damme, it's fun), and only \\"Face/Off\\" is on par with his Hong Kong films.  Maybe he should head back home for inspiration, and stop making the formulaic action pics that Hollywood is famous for.aking the formulaic action pics that Hollywood is famous for.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I'm sorry for all you people that liked this, but to me it was extremely boring and the meaning is DEEP. SO deep that half-way through the movie i said &quot;What is going on? and, is it over yet?&quot; I don't not like writing negative reviews, but this is just my feeling. If i were you, I would save myself the money (renting,buying) and the TIME, and find someting more interesting to watch.
6304696566|4.0|\\"The Searchers\\" is about a five year hunt for a White girl (Natalie Wood) taken captive by Comanche raiders in 1868. John Wayne plays Ethan Edwards,a pitiless, obsessed, ex-confederate soldier who leads the search. \\"The Searchers\\" is considered Director John Ford's masterpiece and one of the top 100 movies ever made. <br /> I like Wayne, Ford, and Westerns, but \\"The Searchers\\" is not one of my all-time favorites. Wayne made better movies: \\"Red River\\" and \\"True Grit\\" come to mind. And Ford made better movies: \\"My Darling Clementine,\\" for example. <br /> One reason to see \\"The Searchers\\" is the scenery. Ford loved Monument Valley in Arizona and Utah and the photography is awe-inspiring. Nearly every scene takes advantage of the magnificience of the natural scene. A second reason to see \\"The Searchers\\" is John Wayne. I've never seen a better image than Wayne's during an encounter with White women who have become Comanche. Without a word, his expression, shaded eyes, and three-day growth of beard convey absolute malevolence. <br /> \\"The Searchers\\" is sporadically brilliant, but uneven. Scenes of low comedy spoil the mood created by Wayne's menacing character and Ford's fine photography.
B000007S5B|4.0|At the time it came out, I was only 20 years old, and the main indicator of the Doors' creativity to me was song length. A mainstream pop song was only 3 or 4 minutes long, that limit having been moved up from 2 to 3 minutes by the Beatles in certain mid-to-late 'Sixties work. But the Doors took \\"Light My Fire\\" and added 4 minutes of organ and guitar solos--which was promptly taken back out to make it radio-friendly. Each of their first two albums had 11-minute magnum opuses as grand finales. The attention span of the rock listener back in my day was much like it is today, hair-trigger boredom reflex and all. Those previous two releases had forcibly removed me from that knee-jerk habit of responding to extended music with this whine; \\"But it's bo-o-oring!\\" I credit the Doors as the first act who gave me the whap upside the head I needed to cure me of that. The trouble was that I still used the clock as a yardstick of a song's creativity--I was just using it in a different way. As such, this album was a letdown--no long stuff. Especially when I spotted the fact that \\"Not To Touch the Earth\\" was a segment of \\"Celebration Of the Lizard\\". They didn't put the rest of it in. Bummer. Why the hell not? Which gave me an excuse to condemn everything else on the album. Like \\"Summer's Almost Gone\\", where Manzarek kicked off the instrumental break with a tango figure, and Krieger continued the mission to bring bottleneck guitar into rock music he'd begun with \\"Moonlight Drive\\". Or \\"Spanish Caravan\\", with its flamenco solo that he couldn't do live because they hadn't invented the piezo pickup for acoustic guitars yet. Or Morrison's work chant \\"My Wild Love\\". This material was mostly top-40 length, but eventually I came to realize there wasn't very much that was top-40 about the content. It was fairly easy to ignore the fact that the opener \\"Hello I Love You\\" ripped off the melody from the Kinks \\"All Day and All Of the Night\\". But that only proves that rock has bred true from the blues, because that practice is a common one over there as a form of paying dues--cover some standard, or do a new number based on it. There are all sorts of arguments in retrospect about what niche the Doors fell into. The punk crowd claims them in their pantheon of patron saints because of Morrison's sensuality, his mean-spiritedness and his contempt for his audience. But the Doors always played too well to ever be punk. The blues crowd lumps them in with the Rolling Stones as blues-rock fusion. But what blues act has ever used classical influences? The prog crowd claim them as elder statesmen based on those classical influences (you'll find a Chopin polonaise hidden in the break in \\"Hyacinth House\\" on the next album \\"Soft Parade\\"--check it out). But prog bands have always been more single-minded in their enjoyment of music with a capital M--the Doors were always more visceral. Maybe the Doors simply defied classification--not only in comparison with other artists--but also in the way you couldn't seem to get a handle on where they were coming from....blues, because that practice is a common one over there as a form of paying dues--cover some standard, or do a new number based on it.

B000067CPX|4.0|This album doesn't ... and the reason is that the only stuff I ever review are movies.  Not that it matters to anybody else, but By The Way is such a good cd.  Californication has a few great songs which aren't equaled on this album, but as a whole this album is better.  These songs don't sound like 60's or seventies pure basic rock, and don't sound either like the synthetic rapock that the industry forces on all new bands.  It's another great album and if you are wondering why I haven't brought up the whole melodic vs harsh thing it's because it doesn't bother me.  It's definately the same band and the music is the best I've heard in a few years from any band.
0440237688|4.0|The Giver by Lois Lowry is one of the interesting novels that I have read. I recommend this book not only 12 years old boys but adults also.  This story brings thinking about life and society.  The author gives ideas about sameness and difference of society.  In Jonas society, every person has same experience and doesnt have to worry about basic needs.  Also, the society doesnt have a social gab.  It is like a utopian society; however, The Committee of Elder decides persons entire life.  At age of 12, every person is received an assignment by the Committee.  Jona, a main character, receives an assignment of the Receiver of Memory.  He receives memories of everything, that prohibit other people in Jonas society, from The Giver.  Jona recognizes secrets of the society, and his adventure starts.
0446677450|4.0|I like what Kiyosaki writes about people who say, &quot;I can't afford this.&quot; He writes that saying this leads to a closing of the mind. You stop thinking about your options for financing the item in question. He says you should say, &quot;How can I afford this?&quot; That will lead you to consider options you have for generating that level of wealth. I'd also toss in the question, &quot;Do I want to afford this?&quot; Many of the things you &quot;can't afford&quot; aren't really worth buying.<BR>I strongly agree with Kiyosaki about the key to personal success. He writes, &quot;In the real world outside of academics, something more than just good grades is required. I have heard it called 'guts,' 'chutzpah,' 'balls,' 'audacity,' bravado,' 'cunning,' 'daring,' 'tenacity,' and 'brilliance.' This factor, whatever it is labeled, ultimately decides one's future much more than school grades.&quot; <BR>Success demands action Kiyosaki writes. That is very correct. I also like what Kiyosaki says about taking jobs to learn and not to earn. Do things which enhance your potential. For example, before starting a software company, it is best to work within a well-managed one to get an idea of how things best work. This in turn is the best book which I have read in a long time.
B000069HKH|5.0|Bruce and the E Street Band still have what it takes to produce and perform meaningful music with a message that isn't preachy, just full of rhythm, rock and roll. Our entire family (husband, wife, teenage girl, teenage son) all love this album and fight over who gets to have it in their car or boom box. Rock on!
B000063UR2|1.0|For starters I would recommend renting this movie before purchasing it. I love fantasy and after watching half of this movie it has almost ruined the genre for me. Legend is much like a minor league baseball player who has not hit a single pitch at bat, in 16 years. I found both music scores to distract and already confusing film. The characters were more like images with no sense of development within the film. As a viewer, I felt dizzy, uncertain, and lost, much like this movie. I would also add that this is not the kind of movie I would allow my children to view.  Bottom Line A: Rent, buying could lead to depression. Bottom Line B: This is the kind of movie you buy for someone you do not like.
B000001BX0|3.0|This album is great. Molotov is a crazy-ass mexican band who to incorporate old school rap and punk into their sound. Its cool, its high energy and the lyrics although very offensive are very funny. If you're into groups like Rage and you speak spanish, check it out.
B00005T30L|5.0|I am not nearly as eloquent as others who have reviewed this before me, so I will just say: this is my favorite movie. Enid's opinions on and reactions to people and situations she encountered were almost identical to mine upon viewing them. In my opinion, if you enjoyed \\"Heathers\\", \\"Broadcast News\\", and/or \\"Clerks\\" (...), you would really like \\"Ghost World\\".
B00005OCMR|4.0|The plot is a little sketchy and the acting can be hokey at times, but there never has been nor will there ever be another movie that looks like Tron.  It is simply awesome.  The extras on this disc are also very well done.  THere's a long interesting documentary and a bunch of other stuff that really make this disc well worth the price.
B00006DEF9|5.0|SINGIN' IN THE RAIN owns you.  First off, Gene Kelly is Jackie Chan.  Oh, sure, \\"Jackie Chan's Chinese, dude.\\"  Gene Kelly and Jackie Chan - if they ever fought, man, I couldn't tell you who'd win.  Sure, he's got rhythm.  Sure, he, erm, sings.  And anyone who has seen Gene in motion can see him influence even the martial artist/actors of today.  He just makes dancing COOL.  And I defy anyone to see the title sequence and not just through out a joyous laugh, easily one of the most famous and greatest dance scenes in films ever.<br />Donald O'Connor is a very funny man.  Make 'em laugh, indeed...<br />Oh yeah, the DVD looks beautiful too, for those movie geeks, like me.  Great transfer, great package.  Let me tell you, I've watched this thing 7 times sine I bought it, and I'm already itching to see it again.<br />SINGIN' IN THE RAIN.  Yes, a musical.  Guys, get it.  Your girl will be appreciative.  And if she's not, she ain't worth being with, let me tell you.  This things' pure joy in 2 hours.
B00003CXXP|1.0|Not one part of this movie is at all believable.  It it poorly written, and should never have been made in it's state.  The acting is great and the SFX are great, but the story is so dumb, insulting, idiotic and contrived that I would've walked out of this movie, had I not needed a ride home.  TERRIBLE.
B000001ESP|5.0|The 1981 release of &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; was the culmination of Rush's efforts at achieving the perfect blend of hard-edged progressive rock with high concept.  The remastered disk presents a highly listenable collection of songs that remain fresh some twenty years later.  This disk also sees Geddy Lee's continuing emergence as frontman with brilliant bass guitar, more synths than previous outings, and more restrained vocals.<br />Focusing primarily shorter songs, between 4 and 6 minutes, this was a leaner and meaner Rush and all the better.  The lone epic, &quot;The Camera Eye&quot; at 10:58, was to be their last, and even this song stands well today with its melodic structure, lyrical imagery and well-balanced instrumentation.<br />1.  Tom Sawyer.  Opening with some trippy moogs sounds a la &quot;2112&quot;, our first glimpse at Neal Peart's continually evolving lyricism brings us a look at a modern boy anti-hero.  &quot;Though his mind is not for rent, don't put him down as arrogant...&quot; gives the impression of the struggle against the status quo.  Be an individual.  Great trading riff on the instrumental between Lifeson and Lee, and some nifty time changes by the band that keep drummers counting.  5 stars.<br />2.  Red Barchetta.  A foray into a Orwellian future where cars are banned and one man commits a weekly crime by taking joy rides in the country, or is it just a dream?  Nice images.  Excellent building from the guitar harmonics at the beginning to the melodic bass during the fadeout.  5 stars.<br />3.  YYZ.  It was years before I learned that YYZ was the airport code for Toronto, the band's hometown.  How appropriate.  This instrumental is much more cohesive than &quot;La Villa Strangiato&quot;, with a rock meets funk meets fusion blend.  Nice work by all three players and awesome drumming by the Professor.  4 stars.<br />4.  Limelight.  An instantly recognizable guitar riff and Peart's lyrics admonition against getting caught up in wanting to be famous.  &quot;Living in the limelight, the universal dream, for those who wish to seem, those who wish to be, must put aside the alienation, get on with the fascination, the real relation, the underlying theme.&quot;  Live your life and don't get caught up with the lives of actors and musicians.  5 stars.<br />5.  The Camera Eye.  This longer piece has two parts, one evoking a more modern era in New York, the other an older period in Westminster.  Great lyrical imagery with &quot;an angular mass of New Yorkers&quot; and &quot;they seem oblivious, to a soft spring rain, life an English rain, so light, yet endless, from a leaden sky.&quot;<br />Lifeson's guitar work shines here.  4 stars.<br />6.  Witch Hunt (part III of 'Fear').  This piece has a very ominous energy, with the mob sounds and dark-sounding guitar build.  Again, excellent imagery of the right-leaning vigilante group and allegories of those who &quot;must rise and save us, from ourselves.&quot;  Plus, the title indicates a foreshadowing of future additions to form a larger whole.  4 stars.<br />7.  Vital Signs.  This song gets a bum rap, but it's also an experiment that foretells some of Rush's experimentation with their next two recordings, &quot;Signals,&quot; and &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; with the &quot;white reggae&quot; sound similar to the Police.  I like the choppy guitar part, finger excercising bassline and especially the drum and snare work by Peart.  4 stars.be famous.  &quot;Living in the limelight, the universal dream, for those who wish to seem, those who wish to be, must put aside the alienation, get on with the fascination, the real relation, the underlying theme.&quot;  Live your life and don't get caught up with the lives of actors and musicians.  5 stars.<br />5.

B00006FDCD|4.0|STEPHEN KING'S IT is arguably the best of the TV films based on a Stephen King work.  While devoid of countless details from the novel that would have made the plot more understandable to those viewers who don't actually READ King, the movie is nonetheless engaging and downright SCARY!<br />One reason STEPHEN KING'S IT rises above standard TV-movie fare is the excellent cast.  John Ritter, Annette O'Toole, Richard Thomas, Tim Reid, and Harry Anderson deliver stellar performances in their roles of adult versions of the story's protagonists, and Jonathan Brandis (later the teen-heartthrob co-star of TV's SEAQUEST DSV), Seth Green, and Emily Perkins do an excellent job of evoking childhood crisis and trauma in the flashback segments.  But it is Tim Curry (yes, THE Tim Curry of ROCKY HORROR fame), as antagonist Pennywise the Clown, who really chews the scenery and steals the show.  If Curry's marvelously malevolent merry-andrew doesn't make you develop coulrophobia (fear of clowns), he will at least haunt your nightmares for a night or two after your first viewing.<br />Another reason this flick rates so highly is that it is, simply put, a ripping good horror story.  King is a master at realistically recreating the wondrous ambiance of youth and childhood, and in spite of the minor shortcomings in the film's recreation of King's plot, the atmosphere of the novel is perfectly translated to the screen.  Besides that, King is also keenly aware that the things that scared us when we were kids are probably still lurking deep down in our grown-up psyche, just waiting to find a little mental crack to jump out of and give us a case of goose bumps and chills.  The film version of STEPHEN KING'S IT finds that same little crack...then pries it wide open!<br />The long-awaited DVD version of STEPHEN KING'S IT is sparse on frills, but it does have an excellent feature commentary with stars John Ritter, Richard Thomas, Tim Reid, Dennis Christopher, and director Tommy Lee Wallace.  Of course, the picture quality is beautifully crystal clear, especially when compared to the VHS version, but purists should consider a few caveats before purchasing. First, the picture has been cropped a bit to simulate theatrical widescreen format.  In comparison to the VHS version, which offers the original 1.33:1 aspect ratio, there are small slivers of image missing from both the top and bottom.  (To be fair, it should also be noted that the picture on VHS appears to be scrunched a bit horizontally to fit it into the TV \\"square,\\" so it really doesn't seem as if all that much has been removed to create the faux widescreen on DVD.)  Also, gone are the \\"To be continued\\" message and the second set of credits, both of which originally appeared between the first half and second half of the original two-part movie (these were included on the VHS).<br />So the new DVD version of this excellent movie should, for the most part, please King fans and general horror fans alike.  For the movie alone, STEPHEN KING'S IT would easily rate 5 stars.  But taking into account the adulterated aspect ratio and the slightly altered transition from Part 1 to Part 2, this DVD gets an overall rating of 4 stars.Of course, the picture quality is beautifully crystal clear, especially when compared to the VHS version, but purists should consider a few caveats before purchasing.

0446677450|3.0|My mom believes in going to school, and getting a good job is the only way to live life, the complete opposite of what Robert T. Kiyosaki's point was.  I also agree with him, but I just think that the book wasn't all that pleasnt to read.  I mean it wasn't all that bad, but many things were repetitive.  He doesn't fully explain in depth the points he is trying to convey.  I still don't know the difference between an asset and a liability.  Most of the things he was talking about wasn't really catching my eye, only becaue the subject of finances isn't all that interesting to me.  But overall, I think that people who believe that in life, one needs to work for money, might change their views after reading Rich Dad Poor Dad.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I generally think that acoustic bands have hackneyed lyrics set to embarrassingly elementary I-IV-I-V chord progessions; however, John Mayer's music and message is good and refreshingly candid.<br />For those of you who have high musical standards and find yourself forever just going back to the classical and jazz standards stations because of the fatuousness of contemporary pop music and lyrics, take a look at this album.
B000002TQV|5.0|THE BENDS is one of the best rock albums ever, certainly in the lackluster 1990's.  Every single song on this album had the potential to be a radio cut while still maintaining the now trademark Radiohead disillusionment and nihilism.  I think of this album as a watershed moment in rock, much like Hendrix's ELECTRIC LADYLAND & ARE YOU EXPERIENCED?, Nirvana's NEVERMIND, Queensryche's OPERATION MINDCRIME, Van Halen's self-titled, RUBBER SOUL & REVOLVER and the like.  All of these albums made people sit up and rethink the current state of rock music and I believe this one did as well (in less of a dramatic fashion of course).  As an aside, I have heard \\"Iron Lung\\" described as containing a 'Jimi Hendrix style freak out'.  Funny.<br />THE BENDS wallows in all of its self-inflicted angst and hoplessness.  It is, to be sure, a depressing album, but the listening experience offered is so genuine and open...it's hard to argue with.  This album is also free of the pretentions that have come with more recent Radiohead releases.  There does not appear to be any of the 'we are going to reinvent rock' mentality of say KID A or the weak AMNESIAC.  Here we just get raw rocking Radiohead with some-but minimal-effects.  The lyrics are in turns fascinating, frightening, and lulling.  I am about the three-hundredth person to review this album, but I just wanted to get my thoughts out on this marvelous piece of sonic tapestry.
B00004YZFR|5.0|I saw this documentary a few years ago and just bought the DVD recently. <BR>I'm not sure about what else I can add about this documentary..but I'll write this as perspective for someone that was a 1 year old in 1969. I've always like the Rolling Stones, and one of the first albums I bought was Tattoo You in 1982. Over the years I haven't really gotten into the Stones...until now. Wow, how cool were they 30 years ago??? It's so great that they are rocking to this day.<BR>This DVD is fascinating, it is the definitive moment in history for the end of the 1960's scene that has been so hyped over the years. The Stones were never really part of the American 1960's hipppie scene and this concert is their fateful testament to that in history - not that the Stones or anyone at Altamont wanted what is documented here to happen.<BR>This documetary slowly builds and carefully climaxes in images and sounds that are impossible for fiction.<BR>A confligration of poor planning, Hell's Angels, Hippies, Money, Rock Stars in reality, and human emotions. AMAZING!!!
B00000JQFM|4.0|SURFING WITH THE ALIEN is completely over-the-top, no-holds-barred, rip-roaring, ...OK. Enough hackneyed quips. Let's face it: this is one of the most unabashedly geeky and self-indulgent albums ever recorded. Joe plays incredibly fast on many of these tunes, barely giving us a chance to catch our breath. The playing never lets up and this turns some people off. But I think that even the most marginal guitar fan has to admit there is some amazing material here. Just to hear a guy play this way is quite an experience. For some, they only need to hear it once. But for many of us it remains one of the most powerful statements of what guitar playing CAN be. And frankly, thank God it is not all like this. I crave variety. As such, I don't spin this disc a lot, but I retain a place of respect for it because I do like most of the songs and I like Joe's execution of them. This disc is the rosetta stone if you will, of the guitar geek/.../shredfest movement. Joe is famous for many reasons. This is the most outstanding one. <br />While you may argue about what makes for good songwriting I think it is important to note that with this type of album the concern is more with crafting a structure within which the guitarist can show off his abilities, sometimes this goal works well with, and leads to, great songs. But not necessarily. It worked in Steve Vai's PASSION & WARFARE and it works here-for the most part. So sit back and soak this in for what it is; a cogent statment of new horizons for rock guitar. My only concern about this disc has already revolved around the sound quality. It's pretty marginal. Joe's guitar is loud enough, but the overall mix is well, not too great. Perhaps this has been remedied some in this remastered version. But don't kid yourselves boys and girls, as any recorded musician can tell you, remastering can only work with what was originally recorded thru the board-it can't take an album that sounds 80's and up date it for today if the mixing was marginal and 'thin' originally.
0316666343|5.0|Its been a long time since i have read a book for the sake of my own enjoyment. A friend of mine said here you should read this. I took it and figured ok, this can't be horrible.  Well, all i have to say is i read over half of it in the course of two days and the rest during the week. It was something i looked forward to reading. I'd pick it up instead of doing my work for school!! It was a great escape from the intense biology, chemistry, and calc classes. I really began to feel for the family and for Susie. Overall it was just a great book. I can't wait for more from Alice Sebold.
0553573403|4.0|I was beginning to think that I'd read everything good out there, but a friend recommended this series and I'm glad I heeded his advice.  Every few years I start feeling this way, and without fail a series comes along which restores my faith in fantasy novels, so that I can spend the next few years wearing that faith back down with horrific ...<br />A number of people have made comparisons to Tolkien in reviews.  Although I like both authors very much, I have to say that there is little in common between their writing.  Tolkien wrote epic fantasy, while this book is more like a fictional history set in a fictional world.  Magic is very rare and barely plays a role in the book (though it does appear in a few critical instances).  Rather than following the paths of a small group of characters, this is a book of politics, with many players, many factions, many locations, and many, many motivations for the many characters.  With little modification, 90% of the material could be dropped straight into medeival and renaissance history books and fit right in (some might say it was taken from there in the first place, given the notable similarities to the Wars of the Roses.<br />The other difference, while I do not mean to overstate it, is the Martin is a significantly less skillful writer than Tolkien when it comes to crafting sentences and paragraphs.  He mostly makes up for this by writing a complex yet understandable plot which is largely well-developed and well-paced.  And some senses this may well make him BETTER than Tolkien, whose writing was rarely as accessible to the average reader and while set in an astoundingly complex and rich world, has trouble at times with pacing and with a number of relatively flat characters.<br />If I had a gripe about this book it would be that too little is resolved and too little is revealed by the end of it, leaving one with a feeling that perhaps a little too much time was spent accomplishing too little plot-wise.  But I enjoyed reading it that whole time, so it's hard to complain too much.ading it that whole time, so it's hard to complain too much.

B00003CXB2|5.0|This movie has everything in it but romance. It simply doesn't need it, because the other elements that make movies great are all there. It would not be fair to reproduce this movie (along with many others), in todays age, digital recreation can only bring the illusion of what once was the true Hollywood. Cleopatra, Gone with the Wind, Spartacus, and many other movies, were made the real way, real actors, and real movie sets.
B00004XONN|5.0|I love those criticisms of popular music that begin \\"obscure band X has already done this and better,\\" as if obscurity were somehow indicative of quality and popularity was somehow indicative of a lack of it. The reality here is that this wonderful piece of popular music, although not obscure, is astounding. Yes, there are hints of jazz and techno and so much else in this beautiful album, and no doubt the detectable influences could go on and on and on. But so what? Listen to the music. From first note to last, this album is a consummate piece of skill that reflects the birth, life and death of some kind of strange musical creature. The opening track has a warped voice that sounds as if a baby is being born (it comes complete with nursery melody). Then we get growth, and the onslaught of life, indoctrination and habit-formation (with the lively National Anthem). We get jostled from a churning beat-heavy track in Idioteque, to a straight-out rocker in Optimistic (ostensibly about survival), to a languid, drawn-out adolescent anxiety attack in How to Disappear Completely. Sometimes we get clouded by snippets of electronic noise that make sense only in the context of the whole song, and sometimes we get (as in the last track) what sounds like very sweet suffering. The bits and pieces are, I suppose, nothing new to people who have heard everything from opera to rap. But that doesn't detract from the excellence of this album. Listen to it.
B00000K3D4|4.0|Wolfgang Petersen's 'The Neverending Story', Ridley Scott's 'Legend' and Jim Henson's 'Labyrinth' could very well be my Holy Trinity of fantasy films of the 1980's. All three of them set landmarks in the genre by showing great imagination and spectacular spirit of adventure. In the case of 'Labyrinth', a movie more intended for children would prove to be the most harsh of the three by touching a subject not very uncommon: stepping into adulthood and leaving infancy forever.<br />Jim Henson had already delighted us with his magnificent film 'The Dark Crystal'. In this movie, he shows once again why he's one of the best puppeteers of the world. Although there are many characters in the film, only two of them are played by human actors. The rest is all puppets. This was Jennifer Conelly's first big role, and she does quite a nice job. The brave, yet sometimes overconfident Sarah manages to capture our attention even when surrounded by all the puppets and artistry of the magical world she's in, but it's David Bowie, as the Goblin King, who gets the best of the movie in a scene-stealing role. His presence alone is astonishing, and even when he could seem a little rigid in his acting moments, he feels right at home during the musical numbers, showing us why he was the one and only option for the part. I hadn't watched the movie in over 10 years, and I still loved all the songs, specially the ballroom sequence, where Sarah and the Goblin King face each other in a masquerade where the two of them are the only ones unmasked. In fact, the only musical piece that I didn't like was 'Wild Gang', basically because it doesn't feature Bowie (and the special effects are pretty lame). As for Henson's work, all the puppets are magnificent and brilliant in detail. This is specially good in the big ones, like Ludo the beast, the Helping Hands and the big robot-like creature at the gates of the Goblin City. Adults with a less 'delicate' sense of humor will crack up with the Bog of Eternal Stench.<br />Unfortunately, once again, fans of a good film will feel betrayed with this edition: a poor presentation, an old documentary, absolutely no commentaries (one by Jennifer Connely and David Bowie would've been the greatest thing on Earth!!) and, worst of all, a mediocre transfer. There is basically no improvement over the VHS version, neither in picture quality nor sound. Bring me the head of the Lucasfilm executive who gave the OK on this paper-napkin edition! Being realistic, I don't think a Special Edition of 'Labyrinth' is planned in the near or far future, so you'll have to deal with this one.

No expense seems to have been spared for the graphic detail is excellent. <BR>The book is also well organized in presenting muscles of the body, making it easier to follow.  Coverage is given for both male and female which makes it a true learning experience.<BR>I did not purchase this book from Amazon, because it was a have to have book. <BR>If you can wait, Amazon has the best deal.
0767836324|5.0|I remember when I saw this film way back when, and now that I've just seen it again last night, I remember just how great it is! It's a wonderful jaunt though the world of the imagination, an escape to a world that has enthralled readers and filmwatchers for decades. 'Hook' is a lighthearted break from reality suited for anyone who enjoys a little fantasy.
0784011206|5.0|What can I say, this movie rocks! from beginning to end,<BR>this movie hits you right in the gut. From the opening scene of John Rambo finding out his only surviving war buddy, succumbed to cancer to being badgered and tormented by the local sheriff! <br />The acting is superb and so is the action. This film has a very<BR>realistic appeal to it with lots of good ideas and great camera work and not over produced! which also lacks in movies today, using over produced scenes w/computer graphics, poor acting and story lines! This film is under 1 1/2 hrs long, but there is more heart, action, and great acting that does not even compare to movies today that drag out over 3 hrs long!!<br />Artisan does an excellent job of putting out this movie, great widescreen edition and cool on screen menu w/ extras. What a difference compared to video tape. The surround sound is good too. What really would have made the DVD extra nice, if the sound was in 5.1 digital with better bass for explosions.<br />Aside from that I give this movie 4 1/2 stars!<BR>Good job Artisan!
B000067CPX|5.0|Riding on the coat-tails of Californication, the RHCPs have once again outdone themselves and created a simply beautiful and emotional album.  &quot;By The Way&quot; is a refreshing break from the self-absorbed rantings of new age metal and the shallow popstars that plague the American music industry today.<br />&quot;By the Way&quot; is an album that you can truly lose yourself in.  While it doesn't have the immediate appeal that some of the tracks from &quot;Californication&quot; had, like &quot;Scar Tissue&quot; and &quot;Otherside&quot;, a few repeat listenings reveal that this album musically and emotionally is a step up in every respect from Californication.  This album hasn't left my car CD player for a month now, with no release in sight.

B000005J08|5.0|This is the first Zorn album that I've heard that I have gotten excited about. (I've not heard that many though so this may not be saying much.) In general, I have not been all that interested in Zorn's brand of thrash/jazz, partly due to it's reputation for wild eclectisim and fascination with cruelty. But actually hearing Naked City, my opinion has changed. <br />Zorn is definately a post-modernist. And as a post-modernist, he has a need to include nearly EVERYTHING on this CD...surf music, 60's film themes, Ornette Coleman covers, country and western (he likes both kinds of music!), cartoon music, film noir music, post-punk...you name it, Zorn includes it. While to me, this post-modern mishmash doesn't work on his string quartets and other &quot;classical&quot; pieces, seeming more pretentious than interesting, here it is absolutely hilarious...there's an almost playful quality to the referencing, much like an episode of the Simpsons. And like the show, he is fast. You miss much on the first listen...even on the fourth or fifth listen. <br />The album is not all fun and games though...Zorn is a serious improviser and so are his bandmates, especially Bill Frisell who is amazing on this album. Some of the cuts are really terrifying in their intensity. F**k the Facts is short but rabid...and the various cuts with vocal noise by Yamasutka Eye (who sounds reminicent of Yoko Ono during the Plastic Ono band period) are all short but powerful. They are the least &quot;pomo&quot; pieces on the album. <br />There are also some really serious beautiful moments as well. Zorn's cover of Chinatown starts as an almost ambient piece and then goes into the familiar Jerry Goldsmith theme with absolute seriousness and, dare I say it, soulfulness. And even the James Bond Theme, which is campy to the max, is also quite brilliantly played and ultimately treated as a serious vehicle for improvisation. <br />Zorn still has his sick moments...mostly in the choice of cover art. I probablywill never understand his fascination with Japanese torture/porn. And at times, the association in the music can turn my stomach a bit (never liked the Black Box work for that reason...seems to glorify cruelty and in this era I think we've had enough of that sort of thing.) But most of this album is a sonic whirl through the musical styles of the past 40 years...held together by the vision of an unique New York Improviser.
B00005QHPQ|4.0|Enrique has a wonderful voice that blends well with his beautiful songs.<br />What I love most about this album is that every song has a very distinct beat.  There are many singers whose songs all sound the same.  However Enrique's album is filled with a variety of beats that all sound great.<br />The lyrics behind each beat are also great.  There's not a lot of repetition of the same lyrics and the words fit perfectly with each song.<br />It's definitely an album I would recommend to anyone!
0440237688|5.0|The giver show to us kind of perfect world. There are some propositions in the book for to show perfect world. Firstly, everything is under control such as, there is no war or fear or pain even if, no feeling. Secondly, every person is assigned a role in the community when the person turns twelve. Jonas who is the protagonist in the book is assigned a role which is the giver. The giver is the only person who can feel the fear, pain, and so on. There are some reasons why I like this book. For example, the author¡¯s imagination that there is no feeling in the perfect is very interesting and funny. Moreover, the author describes the perfect world very specific with detail. That was stimulated my imagination. In addition, the author analyzes the perfect world very efficiently. This book is very useful for stimulating your imagination. I strongly recommend this book for you.
B00005R2M3|3.0|Nowadays when you hear Shakira, you can tell that her English has improved greatly since she first hit it big in the U.S.<br />But that doesn't help when it comes to this album.  The songs have great Latin beats, but her broken English really destroys the beauty of the songs.<br />I think Shakira should have waited until she knew English better before she tried recording songs in our language.  It's just like U.S. singers who don't know a word of Spanish but run to release a Spanish album.  To them, they might not sound that bad, but every Spanish listener will surely cringe at their horrible lyrics.<br />Shakira does have a great voice so if you can get over the fact that many of her songs make no sense and are filled with broken English, you might enjoy this album.
0440219078|4.0|At the first time I read this book, I was very confused because their society is very different from reality and my stereotype. They have special rules own such as assignment. When they are 12 years old, they will be able to assignment each other, and Jonas received the Receiver. When he got the instruction of assignment, it can break the whole thing from community rule, even though he can lie.  When Jonas trained by the Giver, he was surprised because of new experiences; for instance, colors, sunshine, pain, <BR>Anyway, I would like to say it is really wrong idea the rule of Jonass community. There is not any release like my society, and somebody can kill other people because they couldnt do anything in the society. And they are learning something when they are young and they do that job until they are old. Then if they couldnt do that job anymore, they removed. I think the community is necessary to working the society. However, this is really wrong idea. So, I dont agree the plot of the story about society rules; however the book is so fantastic for me, and wonderful!
B000003TA9|5.0|Dirty is as close to commercially oriented as Sonic Youth will likely ever get. A lot of fans probably hate it for that reason, and I think the band wasn't entirely happy either with the slicked-up production job from Butch Vig, producer of Nirvana's Nevermind. I know I'm supposed to prefer Daydream Nation because it was an indie release, but this one is sharper and more biting. The songs are split almost half and half between outrageous Kim screamers and crafty Thurston rockers, with Lee contributing my favorite song, &quot;Wish Fulfillment&quot;. The band explores political topics for the first time, with songs such as &quot;Youth Against Fascism&quot; and &quot;Swimsuit Issue,&quot; and the hilarious exhortation for &quot;Jesse Holmes to come into the pit&quot; on &quot;Chapel Hill.&quot; They use great wall-of-noise effects on the raucous riff tunes (&quot;100%,&quot; &quot;Sugar Kane&quot;) and every track has a memorable melody. The band members continuously experiment with song structure, and almost always have some weird sound happening somewhere. Even when they're mostly just recycling their own sound, as in &quot;Orange Rolls, Angel's Spit,&quot; the result is never less than interesting. Thurston's vocals are as moving as ever, and Kim Gordon makes Courtney Love sound like a spoiled third-grader.

B00006JL1Z|4.0|OK, I wasn't going to review this one at first because I already had all the tracks, but once I actually heard it (and checked out the bonus features), I couldn't resist.  At first I was disappointed because this two-disc set only covers the post-1975 band, which of course leaves out many of their early hits and standards with Peter Green and Bob Welch.  To pretend like the early versions of Fleetwood Mac didn't exist does a great disservice to their history.  Then, there was a slight beef with the track selection--neither CD is filled to its 79-minute abilities, which means that several key post-75 songs--the absolutely essential &quot;Crystal&quot;, &quot;Not That Funny&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, maybe &quot;Eyes Of The World&quot;--could have been added but weren't.  <br />However, what is right with this set outweighs what is wrong with it.  The remasters/remixes found here at the best ever, far surpassing the 80s CD releases and even the &quot;Chain&quot; box set.  What is needed now are remasters of all the albums using this remastering technology.  The inclusion of differing mixes (single mixes?) of &quot;Rhiannon&quot;, &quot;Over My Head&quot; and &quot;Think About Me&quot; was a bonus; &quot;Rhiannon&quot; now features different guitar overdubs and &quot;Over My Head&quot; has no fade-in intro.  The remastering on the other songs brings out a depth and definition which makes them seem fresh again.  <br />Finally, the bonus documentary on the making of the new album was good; it's always great to see Buckingham and Nicks working together again.  I had seen all the videos in the &quot;Vault&quot; section, but apparently it will be updated periodically to include more footage.  In all, this is a suprisingly essential addition to any fan's collection, and makes a good starting point for newcomers, although again there are several things I would change about the track selection.
1878424319|1.0|I made every effort to take Ruiz's principles to heart.  I challenged my own belief system and try to absorb the true principles that The Four Agreements advocates.  What I found was an arrogant author spouting over-dramatized, simplistic principles about nothing at all.  <br />My biggest problem with The Four Agreements is that it is written in such a tone as to condemn anyone who doesn't agree.  The author takes a stance that if you do not agree with his philosophy then you are simple, naïve or beaten into domestication like an animal by your parents.  Read the title and the four agreements themselves and be on your way.  You'll be much better off.
B000002KIE|5.0|Like an A-bomb with the staid, silly '70s as Ground Zero, the Sex Pistols reduced pop culture to rubble and we're still picking up the pieces. It's difficult for me to listen to this album with any objectivity because as a teenager-- even though it was the late '80s-- NEVER MIND THE BOLLOCKS, HERE'S THE SEX PISTOLS changed everything I thought I knew or liked about rock'n'roll. I can only imagine what it must've been like for folks back in 1977.<br />\\"Holidays in the Sun\\" kicks off the album wonderfully, with a powerful, up-lifting riff Steve Jones probably nicked off the Jam's \\"In the City.\\" Johnny Rotten faces down the ghosts of history and finds...his own face reflected there. Greil Marcus wrote that in the final minute of \\"Holidays\\" one can hear the collapse of the world. I don't know about that, but I do know this is classic, electrifying music.<br />\\"No Feelings\\" is one of my favorites, with perfect punk sentiment: nihilistic, blackly hilarious, and absolutely self-absorbed (and a great pop chorus):<br />I seen you in the mirror<br />When the story began<br />I fell in love with you<br />I love your mortal sin<br />Your friends aren't in the way<br />And I love your company<br />I only ever leave you<br />When you got no monEY!<br />\\"God Save the Queen\\"--ah, how to do this marvelous song justice? I know they'd hate this, but it's a rock classic. Royalty is stupid, and that the Pistols released this song at the height of a patriotic fervor during the Summer of Hate only gives them more street cred. Plus the complete negation of its closing chorus: \\"NOOOOOO Future for you!\\" (as well as for me) repeated over and over. Denial is a good thing--saying \\"No!\\" to every stupid idea that comes down the pike is punk's raison d'etre.<br />And of course there's \\"Anarchy in the UK.\\" Blistering. Apocalyptic. Confrontational. Sacriligious. Devastating. The first couplet, with its awkward rhyme, sets the stage for this savage parade:<br />I am an anti-Christ<br />I am an anarchist<br />Don't know what I want<br />But I know how to get it<br />I wanna destroy<br />Passer-by!<br />Johnny Rotten finally reduces British culture to a series of terrorist acronyms:<br />Is this the MPLA?<br />Is this the UDA?<br />Or is this the IRA?<br />I thought it was the UK<br />You're just another country<br />Another council tenancy<br />'Cos I<br />I wanna be<br />Anarchy!<br />Other vitriolic, poison-pen classics include the anti-human screed \\"Bodies,\\" the insult-embraced-as-virture \\"Pretty Vacant\\" and their kiss-off to a record label that rejected them, \\"EMI,\\" NEVER MIND THE BOLLOCKS is a blueprint for so much underground rock'n'roll after it I can't even begin to go into it.

B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie is a disgrace to all who fought and died at Pearl Harbor. There is very little historical accuracy in this film. I am not usually one to be very critical of this, but considering the subject matter of this film I felt that it was very significant. Also, the whole stupid love story part was totally unnecessary and very poorly done. The ridiculous love triangle made me feel like I was watching an episode of Jerry Springer. Also, I felt as though the last hour of the film was also unnecessary. The only reason that it was in there was to show that we got our revenge which isn't really even true. In truth, that mission had very little effect on anything. However, I must commend the action scene. It was very good. If you want to watch this movie, fast forward through the first hour, watch it for 45 minutes, then turn it off. If you want to see a real movie about Pearl Harbor, watch Tora Tora Tora!
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Fleetwood Mac went through numerous band lineups before Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks joined Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Christie McVie in 1975.  The band had experienced great success in England as a blues band in the late 60's and some moderate success in the US as a mainstream rock unit in the early 70's.  But when Mr. Buckingham &amp; Ms. Nicks joined the fold, the band moved into rock royalty.  Their eponymous album reached number one in 1976 and then came Rumours in 1977.  That album which detailed the breakup of the Buckingham-Nicks relationship and the McVie marriage spent a staggering thirty-one weeks at the top of the charts and was the first album to spawn four top ten singles.  The band got experimental on the double album Tusk in 1979, but returned back to their hit making ways with another number one album in 1982, Mirage.  After 1987's Tango In The Night, Mr. Buckingham left the band and the remaining members released the ill-fated Behind The Mask in 1990.  After one short reunion in 1993 to play Bill Clinton's inaugural ball (President Clinton had adopted \\"Don't Stop\\" as his campaign's theme song), they came back in force with a reunion special that was recorded for MTV and became another number one album in 1997, The Dance.  The Very Best Of Fleetwood Mac is not the band's first greatest hits album as they released a single disk hits package and a box set (The Chain-25 Years of Fleetwood Mac), but it is the perfect marriage of the two.  It expands on the original one disk set, but it isn't as overwhelming as the box set.  All the classics hit singles like \\"Rhiannon\\", \\"Say You Love Me\\", \\"Tusk\\", \\"Dreams\\", \\"Go Your Own Way\\" and \\"Hold Me\\" are included as well as top album cuts like \\"Gold Dust Woman\\", \\"World Turning\\" and \\"Second Hand News\\".  \\"Sara\\" was edited for release on the Tusk cd so to keep a single disk, but is included in its complete length which is a treat for Mac fans.  The album's songs are remastered, so even if you already own all of them in other versions, the new sound makes it worth the purchase.  Fleetwood Mac created some of the most well crafted rock songs in the past thirty years and this best of set contains the shining proof.of them in other versions, the new sound makes it worth the purchase.

B0000214F0|1.0|Huge, lavish expansive vehicle for depicting every sort of depravity imaginable (or even UNimaginable). Financed by Penthouse (of course), \\"Caligula\\" manages to trot out good \\"name\\" actors to give a pornographic film some respectability. Too bad. The film is historically debatable on any count and no one's watching this excrement on film for history anyway. I truly believe you can pay Malcolm McDowall to do anything but Helen Mirren is totally debased here. Scatalogical in the extreme, \\"Caligula\\" stands as a total   embarrassment to one and all. Camera work is downright poor at times. Mcdowall hams it up unmercifully and really seems to be enjoying the hideous things he does. A total gross-out for people who like watching bloody car accidents. Help yourself.
6304806442|1.0|Not my cup of tea, but being open-minded I can find it a good movie if your looking for a documentary on the unrepentant evils of heroin junkies. I would recommend it to addicts to watch, perhaps they would then realize how they are wasting away. For entertainment purposes, I found it truthful yet dreary, disturbing, violent and pretty boring. Basically that is all it is about is a junkie trying to go straight in the ghettos of Scotland. Not too much more content then that.  I am certainly not going to say I liked it just because the mainstream said it is brilliant or something. I couldn't wait for this movie just to be over!

Now, thanks to SUNNE IN SPLENDOUR, I have a pretty good idea of it. <br />It's gory in some ways, but it's still a very good book (though 993 pages). it covers so many of the battles, and brings the characters to life. <br />First, there's the sweet-talker Edward IV. <br />Then, the mysterious Anne, who loved only Richard. <br />The Earl of Warwick, the &quot;Kingmaker&quot;. <br />The poor fool, saint, king, Harry of Lancaster, and his wife, the cunning Margurite d'Anjou, almost an Eleanor of her day. <br />The cast is set, the show is on, and the curtain...<br />is about to rise.
B00005JKJA|1.0|What is this movie about? I rented it and watched it. By the end of the film, I wanted to scream. I couldn't believe I had just wasted money on this. Normally, I don't mind films that are weird and mind-bending, where you scratch your head and say, &quot;HUH?&quot; (after all, &quot;Fight Club&quot; is one of my all-time favorite movies, and it took a couple viewings for me to understand everything that had happened in it.) But this movie...I don't even know where to begin. Everyone I know who has seen it absolutely HATED it. By the end of the movie, you don't know who is who, or if anyone is anyone, and the ending was just TERRIBLE. If you don't like strange movies, don't even bother going down this road.

B000066NW0|5.0|When &quot;Complicated&quot; first came on the radio, I hated it. Everytime I turned on the radio, it was playing, and there is really nothing worse than an over-played song. But then, one day, I turned on the radio, the song was playing, and I found myself singing along with it. Pretty soon, every time the song came on, I turned the radio up. I realized then that it wasn't all that bad. In fact, it was quite good, and very catchy. So naturally I purchased the CD for that one song, which I do all the time and regret it. But not this time. Once in a while I buy a CD that I can just stick in my CD player and listen to it all the way through without skipping songs, and this is one of them. A lot of the other tracks on the CD are slower than &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; and &quot;Complicated&quot; but that's ok, they're still great songs (my personal favorites are &quot;Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot;). Another reason I like the CD is because I like Avril. She has called herself the &quot;anti-Britney&quot;, and while her music is still lumped into the same category as Britney's, Avril doesn't have to show us her belly button in order to sell her record. I think that alone deserves 5 stars.

B000021Y77|5.0|All I can say is \\"Wow.\\" After viewing Run Lola Run once, I was sucked in. And now, after having seen it at least 10 times, I still love it just as much as I did the first time. I've seen this movie so many times, I swear I can speak fluent German! It quickly became one my favorite movies of all time. First off, the greatest part of the film is Franka Potente. What a great actress. She makes Lola a believable heroine, and she makes you want to dye your own hair flaming red. She's tough and fearless, and will do anything for the love of her life. The movie plays out 3 different times, each time with a different ending, but every time with one goal: save her boyfriend's life. The movie plays out almost like a music video, for the better part of the film is Lola running through the streets of Germany with a techno-like soundtrack playing in the background. The movie is not even an hour and a half, (some people say that's a good thing) and it goes quick. And, I will be the first to admit, it's not a deep movie, but it's fun. It's fast-paced, exhilerating and just wonderful, and if you haven't seen it yet, please do - it even appeals to anyone who has never seen a foreign film before.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This is the best film I have ever seen. It is quite simply a masterpiece , the perfect film.<BR>What makes it great is not just the superb performances turned in by Pacino, Caan, Redford And of course Marlon Brando but the atmosphere of the whole film. From Ellis Island to long beach you will believe that everything you see can or has happened.<BR>The most notable performance is from Brando who radiates respect and an almost indescribable fear of the man who tottaly commands the cosa nostra. To miss this film would be an infamita and if you cant get hold the film the book is just as good
B00006IUL7|1.0|I found 'Insomnia' highly disappointing. After I saw 'Memento' I was absolutely astounded with how brilliant and gut-wrenching it was. I went into 'Insomnia' expecting it to be brillant- and it was a normal, boring avergae Hollywood film. I was so upset becuase Christopher Nolan seemed to have so much talent with 'Memento'- but after he got recognized by Hollywood and got the famous actors and the big money the talent seemed to disappear.I wouldn't say 'Insomnia' is a bad film, but defintely not a good film, or at least nothing special. I wouldn't recommend it, but I would defnitely recommend other films from Christopher Nolan- hopefully his next will be better.
B00003CXFG|5.0|this movie is fantastic....it gives off the look of an underbudget film (maybe it is, I dunno) but it is a damn good film.  it puts vin diesel at his best.  this is the pinnacle of his acting skills...you put a scarey looking guy in a murderers position, its fireworks....its like puting Hanibal in Red Dragon.....DER its a fit.
080013558X|5.0|i agree with another viewer... this movie is awesome. ive seen other versions, and they just dont pack the punch. there's a hammish quality to this version, almost as if evrybody is slightly over the top, which actually makes it very enjoyable. <br />i've loved this version as a kid and love it more and more as i watch it often..:)
B000002LRX|5.0|Along with Tool's AEnima and Refused's Shape of Punk to Come this is one of the few albums from the ninties that should be owned by everyone regardless of what kind of music you listen to. It is definatly FNM's best, start to finish perfection. If you don't own a copy run out mand buy it in fact buy two.
6305069611|5.0|This movies speaks on a higher level. As if from the aliens<br />perspective. Our reality is a fast paced, confusing, over<br />stimulated existance. We all, as humans, strive to achieve a<br />goal in our life span and get pulled down by the earth (children<br />job, bills, debt) eventually, or die first. Only a few people<br />have been priviledged enough to experience true freedom on this planet. Up until I saw this movie I thought Bowie was one of those people.
1559408855|5.0|I will sum this up as simply as I can... I love this movie! It's an absolute masterpiece! Not only did I find it mentally stimulating, but also it was one of, if not the most erotically hypnotic movies ever. I can't count how many times I rubbed out a jellyfish on the floor in front of me while watching this masterpiece. I would definitely rate it up there with some of the greats (Citizen Kane, 2001 a Space Odyssey, Forest Gump, etc.). This is one movie that someday will be shown in school classrooms around the world. If you haven't yet seen it, then buy all means buy it. You and your family will not be disappointed, I guarantee it!!!!!
B000002GOZ|5.0|Excellent CD.  Great mix of songs, great showcase for bryan's incredible voice.  A must have for BA fans
6305137293|4.0|My parents took me to see this film on Halloween 1981.  Back then, I was only eight years old, but this film still scares me after 20+years!  Unlike the \\"Jason\\" movies, Michael Myers is one of the most \\"classy\\" slashers there is.  His sole purpose is to kill Laurie Strode (a very young Jamie Lee Curtis)and anyone who gets in his way.  It once again seems that Dr. Sam Loomis(Donald- rest-in-peace-Pleasence) is \\"hell-bent\\" on catching Michael before he kills again.  Rick Rosenthal, in my opinion, didn't do such a bad job of directing this film.  However,John Carpenter I believe wrote this one; he just didn't want to direct it.  It picks right up where the original leaves off.  The score is slightly different if you compare the original to this one, but it still gets it's point across to the viewer.  Michael finds new, and unique ways to kill his victims in this particular film.   I think the most grotesque killing is when he drowns the nurse in the scalding hot therapy pool.  After 20 years+, it still remains one of the most concrete, of all the sequels.  The sound isn't the greatest, but it is o.k..  Some special features would of been nice.  Overall, if you are a \\"Halloween\\" fan, like me, it is a good title to have in your collection.
B00005MP58|5.0|This movie is the most amazing adaptation I have seen of Pride and Prejudice. It is as true to the story line as an adaptation can be, plus the parts that are not in the book have more then inhanced the movie. This is one adaptation I can without hesitation say that Jane Austen would be proud of. One can not help but feel drawn to the characters in this movie. It is a must see for all Jane Austen fans young and old. Everyone will enjoy it.
0743201140|5.0|\\"Now, Disover Your Strengths\\", the follow up to \\"First Break All The Rules,\\" is great for two reasons:<br />1)  You get to take the StrengthsFinder test online and discover what your top five patterns of strength are in your life.<br />2)  The book will help you go deeper with your strengths and find out how the best of the best use their strengths to get better.<br />Too many reviews on here focus on the fact that you can only take the test once, or the book does not go deep enough.  Stop trying to find out what you are not, and start finding out what you are!  Most people who want to take the test over and over again do so to validate what they think they are, and not how they were created.  This test is meant to be taken once, in order to measure your instinctive responses to the questions, not your thought out answers.  Unlike other psychometric tests, the StrengthsFinder tells you how you respond, your initial reactions, how you are.<br />I work with this tool on a daily basis and have seen over 500 results of this test and done many one on one interviews to follow up and help people go deeper in their strengths.  9 out of 10 people are amazed with the results and how accurate this test is.  Most of the 10% who have questions can figure it out and be happy with some counseling and deeper discovery of their strengths.<br />The [money] is worth the price to take the test, and the book does an adequate job of going deeper with your strengths.  The whole theory of focusing on what you are good at works, I have seen it and fully endorse this book and what it brings to the field of Leadership Development and Management.
B000000ZGO|5.0|...but, oh, how lovely it is to travel.  Isaac Hayes went into the recording studio back in 1969 with his the Bar-Kays as his backing band and created something magical and timeless that is beyond comparison from anything else I've ever heard.  With only four numbers present here, it'd be easy to second-guess picking this up, but if you do you are a sucker, because you just don't understand how strong and potent this album is.  It's almost ridiculous how many rappers have sampled this material, and how many times they've done it at that, but none of 'em, NONE OF 'EM could amass the emotion and skill that Brother Ike amassed into these four incredible numbers.  The opener 'Walk on By' is not to be messed with for nothin'.  The intro is hypnotic and intoxicating, stretching on for over two minutes before Brother Ike's mournful and dour voice comes in to sing his frustration and sadness away.  Is' a rough number if you lived through it, but it's good fa' the soul.  What follows is jus' somethin' funky, fa'real, an' I'm'a try an' spell it all out fa' you.  'Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymistic' is down-and-dirty gut-bucket funktified soul.  Rhodes electric piano, classic guitar riffs, and that repetitive piano that Public Enemy jus' loves to sample.  Oh, what a classic piece 'a work.  I'm surprised lotsa these reviews don't seem to think too highly of 'One Woman' 'cause I can't get enough of that number.  It's sweeter and more easy-going than the other three, but it's no less strong.  I first tooke heavy notice of it while I was stuck in traffic on the highway on my way to my girl's house an' I heard Brother Ike say \\"I fight my way through the five o'clock rush hour, as daylight slowly leaves the sky...\\"  That stuff gave me chills, fa'real.  The good kinda chills when you can't wait for those loving arms of that special someone to greet you, like they always do at the end of everyday.  It's just a nice poetic song, irreplaceable if you ask me.  Alright, but the truth is that the next number is the real tear-jerker.  For the first eight or nine minutes of 'By the Time I Get to Phoenix' there is nothing in the back ground but a hypnotic thumping bassline and Brother Ike telling a truly heartbreaking story of a man and a woman wo were in love, well, at least the man was in love, you know?  (\\"But, y'see, girls, I don't mean to come down on you, but this man LOVED this woman so, but, they say love is blind...\\")  If you're feelin' it, then when the song finally kicks in, you should already be reduced to a puddle of tears.  Then all you can do is moan an' wail along with Isaac about bein' a prisoner of love who will never be free.  <br />Fellas, if you've ever had your heartbroken, an' you intend to get anything outta reading this review, it should be to not go another day without this masterpiece.  If your lovelorn, sad, an' need somethin' to feed your sadness, or somethin' to keep you in touch with your spirit and soul, then this is the album to pick up.  It's by all means one'a the baddest and best soul albums of ALL TIME, flawlessly performed from start to finish.  Like I said, it's a long and lonely road, but it's a lovely one to travel.  Again and again.
0064407667|4.0|The Bad Beginning is the first book in the Unfortunate Events Series and in my opinion one of the best. The series is about 3 orphans, named Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelair who have to extremely bad luck and have to keep running from an evil man named Count Olaf that's after their fortune. Now, in this particular book is when everything started going wrong for the Baudelairs because first their parents die in an awful fire that also burned down their house and then had their first encounter with the greedy Count Olaf. Then things just slowly begin to get worse from there. I think the Unfortunate Events series is an exciting and adventurous book that makes you keep on reading because you always want to know what happens next, so I can safely say that this book is a real page-turner.
B000065AQU|5.0|I love this friggin CD.  It has to be one of the best follow-ups I've heard for a while, right along the lines of Slipknot: Iowa and Disturbed: Believe (in case you're wondering, I just bought this the other day).  Buy this one!...
0316666343|1.0|The Lovely Bones had a Lovely Book Cover and that is about it!<br />Seldom am I pulled in by so much hype over a book,<br />but must admit that is why I bought this book.<br />Also, I thought the concept might be interesting.  I thought I would never get through this book, but made myself do so.<br />I read the book to the end, as painful as it was for me. I felt it was poorly written, and a waste of time. It held no interest for me whatsoever.  There are so many great books to read.  The Lovely Bones is not one of them.
B00006DEF9|1.0|\\"Singin' in the Rain\\" is one of my favorite films, and I am in good company with that opinion -- everyone from Roger Ebert to Francois Truffaut has rated the film in their top ten.  So why such shoddy treatment in this \\"Special Edition\\"??  95% of the \\"commentary\\" is audio cribbed from the documentaries on Disk 2 (did they think we wouldn't watch both?) and the other 5% is Baz Lurhmann promoting his own films.  While brilliance is floating across the screen, the commentary treats us to such prescient details as the flower preference of the producer (orchids) and how one of the minor actors in the film felt about Clark Gable (loved him very much).  Since neither orchids nor Clark Gable have anything to do with this extremely influential film classic, couldn't we have given those comments a miss?  As a huge fan of this film, I bought the edition knowing a fair amount about the making of and history surrounding it --  if it is possible, I left this viewing of the film with \\"commentary\\" actually knowing less.  Give this edition a miss and buy a cheaper one.  (Added note: another person has complained about the aspect ratio being altered -- in fact, Singin' in the Rain was NOT shot in \\"Cinemascope\\" and has been transferred with the full picture intact.  See?  Now THAT'S the sort of stuff they should have mentioned in the commentary!)
B000002AH7|5.0|This is a wonderful work of art.  The Concierto De Aranjuez is quite possibly the most beatiful piece of music I have ever heard.  Words cannot describe it.  It is a wonderful example of the fusing between jazz and a neo-classical concerto.  As for the rest, it contrasts nicely with its more defined and sharper sound.  For trumpet players like me, listening the the horn work on Saeta is a real treat.  This is one of my favorite CDs of all time.  Also, this is one of Tom Harrel's favorite CDs ever.  Some people feel that it is out of character, but it is not.  You can tell that it's a Miles solo on the Concierto de Aranjuez.  If that were the only song on the CD, it would still be worth it.
0380820846|4.0|First off, I have read this whole series and I must say that I absolutely love her!! From the first time we were introduced to Penelope and Colin, I loved them. Colin was my favorite Bridgerton and Penelope was my favorite friend on the &quot;side.&quot; So, deep down, I really wanted to see Penelope with a Bridgerton and Colin with a neat person. So, you can imagine how delighted I was to see these two in their own book!! Although, I admit, I was a little disappointed because I thought there should be more substance in this story. I thought Anthony and Daphne's stories were so much more fun. But this one was great, too. I highly recommend anyone to read this series if you love a funny, light hearted fun read!! Julia Quinn is wonderful!! My favorite, actually!! I find myself counting down to the date of her next book release. I just love her.
B00003CXS4|4.0|I have yet to see Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, but I really enjoyed Snatch.<br />I loved the stylistic nuances. It reminds me of Pulp Fiction. It has its own look. I loved, for instance, how every time Frankie \\"Four Fingers\\" thinks about gambling, there's a quick clip of him wildly gambling with the background score Viva Las Vegas. Or when Dennis Farina's character takes a shot, jumps on the Concorde, and gets his passport stamped, all in 5 seconds.<br />My only problem with the film is that it lacks substance. The characters are kind of like caricatures. But it's a fun, exciting comedy, and it's one of the few films I can enjoy repeatedly. And that says a lot.
B00006G8HX|4.0|This is the odd-numbered Trek film with the unfairest rap for being part of the odd-numbered \\"curse\\" of Trek films (the even-numbered ones are all good, the odd-numbered ones are all bad).<br />\\"The Motion Picture\\" was epic, but wrong for Trek. \\"Khan\\" was fun and had a lot of dazzling visuals, but it too seemed to be \\"off\\" just a hair. The fourth film was funny, but not at all what it could've (or should've) been. The fifth film had excellent bookends, with a disasterous and dopey story in between, and the sixth was good, but too far out there. While \\"Khan\\" had the Trek-style action sequences down, and is generally viewed as the best Trek movie, this one gives \\"Khan\\" a run for it's money in all other areas. Overall, like it or not, \\"The Search for Spock\\" really is the best Trek film, the film that is more in touch with Trek than any of the others.<br />Some of the bad rap against the movie is justified, but not all of it. After all, the film is kind of a downer, throwing some majorly bad juju at Kirk. Enterprise is to be scrapped. Kirk can't get a ship so he can help Spock and McCoy. Kirk has to go against orders and his career is finished. David. The destruction of the Enterprise. Not as much fun as the \\"Khan\\" film. Not as bland as \\"The Motion Picture\\".<br />Probably the biggest plot hole here is when Kruge kills off his lover because she has seen the Genesis tape, and then later he shows it to his underlings anyway. Of course, it made him look all the more ruthless, but it was also kind of dumb.<br />Right up there with that plot hole has to be the destruction of the Enterprise, as spectacular as it was. Even after twenty years, I've never been able to believe that Scotty couldn't fix the automation circuit, or Checkov couldn't have run down to the phaser control room to manually blast the bad guys. Still, the last moments of the famous starship are great.<br />Despite having the reputation for confirming the \\"curse\\" of the odd-numbered Trek films, there really are some awesome moments in this one. Saavik's berating David for using proto-matter, Kirk stumbling in grief and rising right back up again, the dead silence when Kirk and Spock meet again, with Kirk saying, \\"You would've done the same for me.\\"<br />This is a really good film, and Nimoy handles the direction with polish and finnese. While it is true that the film was a bit darker than the preceeding two Trek movies, and not as much of a fun actioner as \\"Khan\\", they also got a lot of things right. You can tell this is true because, unlike the first two Trek releases on these collector's DVDs, \\"Star Trek III\\" has no re-editing, cut segments restored, or extended scenes in evidence. While a bit disappointing not to see extra footage or whatnot, it really is satisfying to know that this film simply didn't need reworking to make it better. I think that this is due mostly to Nimoy's input on the film. Nimoy is an \\"old-school\\" actor, versed in the classics and great literature, and his intellegence shows clearly in both his directing and his comments.<br />The extras on the new DVD are absolutely stellar, better that the extras on the \\"Khan\\" disc, and far better than the extras on the \\"Motion Picture\\" offering. There is a 30 minute discussion on terraforming that is very interesting. Besides going into the technical aspects of terraforming, one of the interviewees discusses the differing views of both Trek 2 and Trek 3 regarding the morality of \\"playing God\\". The commentary track, a mix of Nimoy, Bennett, Curtis and others, is intellegent and informative.<br />This is an excellent movie, and an excellent Trek.re some awesome moments in this one.

0316666343|5.0|As an editorial assistant at a major publisher, I read hundreds of books and manuscripts every year.  I try to keep up with the books from other houses that make the bestseller lists, so I dutifully picked up THE LOVELY BONES, expecting a dreary and upsetting story of violence and bereavement.  <BR>THE LOVELY BONES is not that.  It is brutally affecting in its depiction of the violence Susie suffers, and the different ways her family members cope with her death; but ultimately, it is a joyously life-affirming story.  <BR>It is, quite simply, one of the best books I have read.
0786868694|1.0|I bought this book based on Nigella's two excellent previous books, both of which I own and have used. Nigella Bites appears to be an attempt to quickly exploit the buzz of her show. Do the math: the book is half the thickness of How to Eat, with larger typeface, frequent half and full page pics, whole pages devoted to a single quote, and 2-4 lined empty pages per chapter for your notes. I would guess that there is about 15% of the content of each of her previous works, and I am being generous. Avoid this tie-in and buy one of her other books.
B000055ZB8|5.0|Before Bela Lagosi put on the black cape to play Dracula, Max Schreck played the vampire (under the name of Count Orlock.), and he has remains the scariest vampire ever to be filmed.  You have to see this movie to fully understand what I mean.  The man is extremely creepy.  <br />The story is the same as Dracula but it is told differently.  The location is changed to Germany and there are very little sets.  Most of the movie is done in locations that were landmarks back in 1922 so that there is a more realistic feel.  The best scene when Count Orlock is traveling by boat and the mates mysterious become ill and die.  I actually jumped when he finally revealed himself.  <br />This movie is silent and is accompanied by either an orchestra or organ music.  I suggest the orchestra although at the slow point you'll wonder if they were playing while watching the movie.  During the scary parts they were right on the money.

6304698658|4.0|Like others here, I really enjoyed Christmas Vacation, and I thought it was very funny.  My favorite scene was when Clark calls his boss every name he can think of when he doesn't get his bonus.  (Who wrote that?)  I agree that this is a pretty basic DVD with hardly any extras.  Instead of production notes, I would like to see deleted scenes and especially bloopers!  However, I do not believe this movie needs to be widescreen, and I am a big fan of widescreen formatted movies.  The fact is, there are two kinds of widescreen: anamorphic, which has an aspect ratio of 2.35:1, and Academy Flat, which is 1.85:1.  Christmas Vacation is of the latter type.  Academy Flat movies are actually filmed in an aspect ratio very close to television anyway, 1.33:1, and later cropped in the theater during projection.  So a full screen version of an Academy Flat movie is actually showing you more than what was in the theater.  Academy Flat is really not that wide, so you're not adding a lot to the experience when you get a widescreen version.  That's why many Academy Flat DVD's are released full screen.
6305546789|5.0|This is a classic movie of horror.  My collection of Halloween items is huge but my most prized is a Limited Edition copy of Halloween released by Anchor Bay Entertainment.  John Carpenter and Debra Hall directed a miraculous film.  Halloween is what horror fans like me use to judge all other horror films.  It's great to see a bunch of kids change the film world.  Halloween has all the great characteristics of a great horror movie.  They scare you when you least expect it.  All the things your parents told you not to do results in death.  And the best a crazy murder stalks you until he has finished off all your friends.  John Carpenter and Debra Hill put on screen all the things that scare us.<br />If you have a couple of hundred dollars to spare get the Limited Edition version.  It is a great addition to a DVD collection.  The transfer is perfect one of the best. A number of special feature give you all the background information you need.  There is also two versions of the film. One released for TV and the Theatrical release.  There is so much to say.  Just watch it if you haven't.  I always love getting the chance to show this movie to a new viewer.  It's just my passion for movies.
B00000JRTX|2.0|When I first saw this movie, in theaters, years ago, I enjoyed it. I liked the obvious comraderie shared by Charles' (Grant's) crowd. Watching the friends interact made you think of your own friends.<BR>I bought it on DVD a couple years ago and watched it again recently...<BR>What a disappointment. I found I couldn't get past my dislike of MacDowell's character. What a lousy character. She is manipulative, a phoney, a liar, and is just a bit too superficial and casual when it comes to relationships and sex (she's obviously marrying Hamisch for money- he owns \\"half of Scotland\\" and is \\"twice her age\\"...and oh, she's only slept with 33 men) as can be... I found it so hard to sympathize, to root for these two when they were so self-absorbed and confusing. And that ridiculous line at the end: Is it raining? I hadn't noticed...\\" Yuck.<BR>Can't blame MacDowell- and I have to say, I usually like McDowell. I thought she was awesome in Sex, Lies & Videotape, Unstrung Heroes, and even Green Card. And you have to applaud the fact she is attractive even if she does not conform to the Hollywood standard of beauty. She is no size 4,  and seems comfortable in her womanly figure. <BR>Anyway- this time around even the friends seemed a little stale- a little too forced, although the funeral was a thoughtful and moving scene. But Grant whining about commitment, and MacDowell sending mixed signals...why would I ever care for these two screw-ups??<BR>Anyway- it's an average movie- there are some great moments of comedy and they might even distract you from the leads, if you're lucky...

0517189542|4.0|Louisa May Alcott's novel, Little Women, is truly a classic story of family love.

B00005JKMQ|5.0|I don't think that, for most people, this film will ever measure up to the real Muhammad Ali.  Muhammad Ali was so reveared and admired as a human being that people are expecting this outstanding film to blow your mind away.  It sure blew my mind away, but for some reason alot of people in the world says it didn't do that.  &quot;It was boring and long and drawn out.&quot;  Not really!  I would dare say that Muhammad Ali, while on the set, told Michael Mann exactly what was going during every part of his life.  Maybe what we see as &quot;Long and Drawn out&quot; might avtually be the REAL way it happened.
6303109950|4.0|TOMBSTONE is as rough and raw as the tumbleweeds blowing across the Arizona dessert.  This is a satisfying \\"shoot 'em up,\\" a throwback to the finest Westerns of the genre, pitting good against evil.  Dusty, gritty, dirty, violent--dripping with testosterone--TOMBSTONE delivers, viewing after viewing.<br />Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday steals the show; Kurt Russell turns in what I think is his finest performance as the brooding Wyatt Earp.  Even more thrilling for an \\"old geezer\\" like myself was Charlton Heston's cameo and the narration by Robert Mitchum--two icons with symbolic ties to classical Westerns.  A chubby Billy Bob Thornton (before his fame--or \\"infamy\\") appears in one of the film's most amusing scenes.<br />Look beyond the historical inaccuracies:  TOMBSTONE is escapist entertainment at its best.
B000069HKH|5.0|I'm kind of amazed by the sour \\"he's over the hill\\" sentiment of some of the negative reviews here. This album includes some of the best songs by Bruce Springsteen and the E St. Band since _Darkness on the Edge of Town_. <br />\\"Worlds Apart\\" is in 5/4 time, which makes it stand out from the rest of the songs on the album immediately. I have never heard Springsteen incorporate any world music elements before (aside from a vague Latin feel here and there) and yet here is an unmistakable Middle Eastern feel that builds to a searing guitar solo, the like of which I have not heard from Springsteen since \\"Adam Raised a Cain\\".<br />Anyone who believes that this album is a lame response to the terrorist attacks has some soul searching to do. If you really listen to these songs, they are going to make you cry. It's that simple. \\"Empty Sky\\" and \\"Mary's Place\\" are just achingly sad. <br />Perhaps more important is the message that is repeated in several lyrics that it is understandable to be angry, but it isn't a good idea to simply want revenge. This is a mature response to the crisis. Much more mature than most of the pop song responses to the terrorist attacks and arguably more mature and level-headed than the government response.<br />This is a heck of a lot more than a popular music album. It will not be one of Springsteen's big sellers because it is very serious and demands a lot from the listener.
B000002VCB|5.0|Wow...couldn't believe some of the backlash in other reviewers' comments.  I have all of Mr. Parsons' works and to me, this is one of his best.  I think the melodic content and lyrics are top notch, and if one looks deep into this collection, you'll see an almost mournful reflection on the state of women.<br />&quot;Lucifer&quot; is a fine instrumental opening, typical of Parsons ability to make repetition interesting; &quot;You Lie Down with Dogs&quot; is a marvelously satiric look at what happens when you &quot;lower&quot; yourself to perhaps indulge in a little friskiness outside the norm; &quot;I'd Rather Be a Man&quot; is no more than an ode to the redneck, and works quite well, I think;&quot;Windind Me Up&quot; is bouncy, infectious and harmless; &quot;Damned If I Do&quot; is one of my favorite Parsons songs---the soaring string arrangement amidst the quasi-rock feel work well in conveying the feeling that you are damned if you do, damned if you don't...&quot;Don't Hold Back&quot; is one of those lovely Parsons ballads that uses the female voice to remind men that we wouldn't be well off without the fairer species; and &quot;If I could Change Your Mind&quot; is another winner, a lush and lovely vocalization that surreally wraps up the collection.  Chauvinistic---I hardly think so; musically brilliant?  As always (with the exception of &quot;Vulture Culture&quot; and &quot;Time Machine&quot;)./<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00005YW4H|5.0|Who the heck is Norah Jones?  She has taken over my entire CD collection.  I might as well throw away my Bonnie Raitt, Diana Krall, and others.  She gets more play in this house than the Redskins.  Without doubt, the best and now most played CD of my entire collection.  For six weeks now, Come Away With Me, is played at least 5 times a week.  You are guaranteed to fall in love with her voice, her selection, and the mood set by the CD's producers.  A guaranteed winner...

630289915X|5.0|How any one can give this movie less than, say, four stars I can't imagine. It is the world's greatest Christmas movie ever and definitely in the Top 10 movies of all time. James Stewart gives a perfect performance as George Bailey, the small-town man of Bedford Falls who always wished he could go out and do something great with his life. &quot;I want to shake the dust of this crummy town off my feet, and I'm going to see the world!&quot; he says. But then he meets Mary, and falls in love with her. Clarence the Angel is also a great character. He guides and helps George throughout most of the story. The story has a great message, too. It's a Christmas classic I watch every Christmas Eve, and it's not to be missed.
6305069611|4.0|I have not sen this movie on DVD yet, (I just found out it had been relased and am going to buyu it) but it was in fairly high rotation at out local \\"Art\\" theater when I was in High School\\" and a good rental in subsequent years.<br />The film has the other worldly qualities of many european sci fi books (and some American speculative fiction).<BR>This is low tech fun.  (Watch \\"Farenheight 451\\" for a similar feel.) <BR>Bowie is great as the alien. He plays the part much the way he plays the various stage personas in his music career.  (He is definitely playing a different character here than he does in: \\"Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence\\" for example, which suggests that he might be able to act)<br />\\"Slow paced, but odd\\" might be a good description. If you like that kind of thing, then see it. <BR>This is not a traditional \\"Hollywood\\" Sci fi movie with lots of lasers and explosions. The hero is not a traditional hero. Howard Hughes is probably the most similar real person the this main character.  If that interests you, then good. If not, then stay away.  <br />As far as Bowie music tie-ins all you get is the covers of two albums somewhere in the film.  1.) The picture of Bowie on the cover of \\"Low\\" is taken from the same era.  2.) The cover of \\"Station to Station\\" shows Bowie walking into the space ship he builds in the film (though I've never noticed that exact shot in the movie).
B00003CXZ4|3.0|This movie had me up until the end.  It just wasn't believable--no, I don't mean a reality-based believable, I mean that the character would not have done what he did at the end.  After sitting through this film and getting to care about this guy (even though he was a shmuck), they go and pull that on me.  Yeah, human nature is suprising, but really this was less of a suprise and more of a predicatable hollywood ending. It ruined the whole feel of a very well paced and intriguing movie.  I would have given it 5 stars for it's unique qualities and ability to draw you in, but the ending was anything but unique.  It was intentionally made to please the viewer with a pose of the unique, but it was almost a cliche.  Trying to be somewhat like Seven.  But Seven had already been made, and Pitt's character in that film did what he probably would have done.  For someone with this guy's curiosity, he would not have taken the action that he did.  Why be so into finding out about what happened that you tattoo yourself over every inch of your skin, then go and blow it all with a simple act of unfounded vengeance.  Sure veangeance is a strong emotion, but this guy isn't lazy, he's not tired of the hunt (he can't be, he forgets how tired he is every day), but for some reason he just gives up at the end.  I don't accept that.  It was lame and I feel cheated, not out of my money or time, but out of a promising 2 hours of film that was corrupted by the director's (or whoever controlled him) desire to make an ending that satisfied the masses instead of something true.
B000002ADT|5.0|So much has been said about this album that  I don't feel I can add anything new, so I'll make this review short.  What is it about Kind Of Blue that has created such an impact? For one, it's the amazing way this group of talented musicians interact and seem to understand each other perfectl-it's amazing to think that this is improvisation.  I have to say that I found Wynton Kell (who appears on number 2 only) impressed me slightly less than the fantastic Bill  Evans, who's playing with supreme bassist Paul  Chambers is phenomenal. In fact, that's how I'd describe this album-phenomeal.  If you want  Davis, Coltrane (who is perfect) and all the others at their best, go no further than this.   From the carelessness of So What to the heartbreaking melancholy of Blue in green, this is an experience not to be missed.   BUY THIS ALBUM!
B00005YUNY|5.0|This DVD actually choked me up.  I couldn't be happier that YES has been captured in a concert that is so representative of both their past and present.  The highlights include Gates of Delerium and Ritual.  But all of the cuts are good.  I missed Awaken and Wonderous Stories, but the song selection is so strong that I can't complain.  <br />The orchestra is filled with youthful females who move to the music and charm the viewers with their sincerity and musical competence.  They wave their instruments in the air at times catching anticipations and subtle nuances with the precision of a choreographed dance team.  Finally, for an encore, the orchestra actually joins YES on stage dancing joyfully to Roundabout which even manages to get a smile from the ever-stoic Steve Howe!<br />A little over-edited, but I loved it.
1857026691|4.0|Excellent book that takes the reader through one of Mathematics' most fascinating stories. This is not about whether you were good or bad in math at school, or are interested in Math, rather its about appreciating what makes Mathematics one of the most powerful things on Earth and why its appealing to so many. The author does a great job of giving a simple and historical explanation to the evolution of mathematics. This is an enjoyable read for someone who knows nothing about Math (thats me!).
B00005JKJA|5.0|There are two ways to watch this movie, as these reviews show.  One is to watch it like you would any other film, as if something will happen and things will connect and make sense throughout the film.  If you do this you will most likely leave the theater (or your couch) feeling nauseous and frustrated and pissed at not only David Lynch but the world as well.  <br />Then there is the other way.  You know what happens when you try to analyze a dream while you're in the dream.  You wake up, and the dream is over, and you are frustrated and confused.  You have to watch this as you watch one of your own dreams--without judgment or speculation (that is, as if it had no point) and as if it were completely about you.  Which it is.  Well, not necessarily you, but everyone.  This film is about identity and how we each create and massage our own to fit into different scenarios we encounter throughout our lives.  Or it's about identity in how a naive person can often become a bitter person--how we change from carefree children to vengeful adults.  In reference to its Hollywood setting, it's about acting and over-(re)acting. Whatever it's about, if you watch this as if you are every character, many points will come across. I'd love to talk about them here but won't spoil anything.  But some things to think about afterward: ambition, expectations, self-esteem, masturbation, and selfish love.<br />Concerning the DVD: Really this is a theater movie since at one scene, if in the theater, you end up looking at a mirror image of yourself in the theater (sparsely populated and all).  You can't get that effect from video, even if you saw it in the theater your first time around.  Even so, Lynch brings enough stunning visual imagery to this flick that it does well no matter what.  The DVD transfer picks up all the succulent colors, foggy or brisk imagery and pounding audio that Lynch intended.  Despite that one scene that nothing could be done about, the video is just as good an experience as the theater.<br />I have to add, forsaking any intellectual merits of the film, as a typical girl-crazy man, even if this movie isn't for you, watching close-ups and lengthy shots of Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring for 2 1/2 hours isn't all bad.  If you've ever watched a movie just to get a look at the presence on screen (we all have, come on now!), this film, without question, is the best ever made at giving one a visual depiction of intense beauty.  If you don't finish this film completely and abysmally smitten with Naomi Watts, then you're either in serious denial or you've got yourself a damn fine woman.
0316666343|5.0|A perfect book.  Exquisitely, achingly beautiful.  Agonizingly painful.  Fresh without ostentation.  Generous.  A seemingly simple but intricately woven story embracing loss and love through the sensations and narrative of a life.  Delicately, but unforgettably, a voice for people horribly lost, headlined, quantified, and the people who love them.  I stopped reading, only sometimes, to catch my breath.  And look around.
6302409365|3.0|The Addams Family begins with a hearty chuckle, as a group of nauseatingly cheery carol singers are treated to a dose of Addams hospitality.  The film is of course a 1990s revamp of the 1960s television series with the catchy refrain: &quot;They're creepy and they're kooky, mysterious and spooky, they're altogether ooky.&quot;  However, the film lacks the delicate balance between finesse and crudity that marked the original; perhaps this is the result when a cult show is turned into movie fodder for the masses.<br />The Addams' live in a decaying mansion that boasts such attractions as a graveyard, a swamp and a vault full of money.  It is this last which attracts the attention of a crooked accountant and his unscrupulous client Mrs. Craven.  Their plan is to install Mrs. Craven's son Gordon in the house as 'long-lost' Uncle Fester Addams, with the purpose of gaining access to the vault.  Initially Gordon is all for this plan, but once he gets to know and like the family, he undergoes a crisis of confidence and must decide where his loyalties lie. <br />The plot may be depressingly formulaic, but fortunately it is in the Addams' nature to be quirky.  The humour is generally quite fresh and clever - who would have picked the villain's ultra-conventional wife pairing off with hirsute (and definitely unconventional) Cousin Itt?  But along with the hits, there are some equally spectacular misses, including almost everything involving Grandma Addams.  The other female Addams' are excellent, especially young Christina Ricci as the perpetually sullen Wednesday.  Ultimately though, you have to wonder if the mysterious and macabre charm of the Addams has lost something in its modernisation, and if perhaps they should have been left to rest in peace.

0446608955|5.0|This book was one of the best romance novels I have ever read, it shows how kids can be so rude and cruel, even back in those days. Jamie, was such a loving girl and they way she says everything like in &quot;the Lord's plan&quot; it all comes together in the end why she is and says the things she says. I truly cried when i read this book. When writing a book its hard to make someone cry one moment and laugh the next and this book did all that over and over again!.<BR>I only wish i could find more of Nicholas Sparks books, he is a fantastic writer with alot of talent! <BR>If anyone could suggest anymore of his books please post it.<BR>thank you
0440219078|4.0|Jonas community is different from our common society. They stress the conformity and sameness. They will receive the assignment at 12 age, and they should follow the assignment which was arranged each other. They don't know common thing like color, snow, pain, war and so on, because the community is very specially. Jonas would be able to receive the Receiver from the ceremony at 12 age, and he trained by the Giver. At the end of the story, Jonas leaves to the community with his brother who has same color eyes with Jonas.  I hate the rule in the story because it interfere their freedom and choice for the future. In addition, they don't care death; moreover, they think the death is the real release So, I opposite to the side of the story. However, it might be right the community is perfect society. There are not any difference between people like poverty and rich, idiot and genius. If they don't know another society, they will be live very perfectly. I impress the part of training about Christmas. Jonas considered the family and love at there. It is one of the emotions, but in the community, their family is not real, and it is also already decided by community. They have a birth mother separately.  The book is very differently other fiction, and I think about the common our society again, and I can remind the material who settled in the present because of the story.

0792151712|4.0|The Titanic starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet with a running time of 194 minutes depicts the most monumental tragedy of the Edwardian era. Jack and Rose protray two mismatched lovers that break the rules according to class. There are several aspects that one can look at this movie:  The cast of the show are diverse and some seem to believe that Jack was to young for Rose, however, I liked their chemistry on the screen. Secondly, the issues that were playing out in regards to the snobbery of the people that were on board especially when the collison occurred, and how there were many things go wrong resulting in a greater number of loss of life due to this aspect. Such as not filling the boats to their capacity because the people were selecting just the upper class, then Rose's mother even being so bold as to say that out loud saying that the boat should be seated according to class. The main idea of the boasting was that the ship absolutely could not sink. Then there was the speeding up of the boat just to show off by the one man that eventually jumped into the life boat ahead of women and children to be saved. There there was the tragedy itself of losing so many people in the water that night. <br />Now to pull all three of these aspects and have it play so smoothly, was wonderful. Having all that water to deal with was spectacular. <br />Of course, my own opinion was that the likeness to the Edwardian period was so perfect even down to the last detail. I really enjoyed that. <br />Lastly, to have such a long movie, it was separated porportionately as to keep the audience interested in the love story, the action, and the tragedy all at the same time, I do give it four stars. Well done.

B00005JKWJ|2.0|All in all roughly put this movie was ok.  I didnt like the face That I could spot the weak CG special effects off the movie.  And one of the best characters 'Snowman' had a small part in the movie and was killed off.  The plot was thin, its like people wanted a Blade movie, and they got this, semi-ok movie.  The first one was alot better. All in all go watch a good movie like Black Hawk Down.

0375414053|2.0|When I read the excerpt for \\"I Don't Know How She Does It\\" in the September issue of Vogue, I rushed out to buy the novel.  Why?  Because I AM Kate Reddy.  I work in international finance, have two  young child and travel excessively.  While I expected a humorous and truthful tale about the delicate balance between work and motherhood, what I found was a ridiculous, implausible story. Sure, there were some funny bits about returning to work too soon and the \\"mothers superior\\" stay-at-home types.  But on the whole, Kate ignoring her wonderful husband, putting up with her lazy nanny, hitting on her client and smoking a joint before a meeting, and always being relieved be away from the kids is unbelievable rubbish!  Any real working mother will tell you that they adore their supportive husbands, they work hard to find a great nanny and they don't have time for romantic distraction and believe me, drugs are out of the question.  Finally, the kids are the only thing that keep you going.  I, for one, cannot wait to go home every night to see mine.
B00005M91K|5.0|...If I could only choose one word however, it would be \\"perfection.\\"<br />As stated in previous reviews, this is not a film, it as an experience, an journey both visually, intellectually and emotionally. Hearing about the quality soundtrack and the methods used to film (TODD-AO 65mm) I was expecting a DVD full of beautiful landscapes and various eyecandy from around the world. It turned out to be so much more, and perhaps the best value [money] can get you now. <br />Everything about this production is flawless. From Fricke's shots and use of cinematography, the segues he uses, the soundtrack, it all integrates seamlessly into one beautiful that cannot be described. <br />If you ever liked anything by Kubrick this will blow your mind. Even if you don't like Kubrick, you owe it to yourself to at least give it a try. Even if the deeply intellectual aspect of the movie does not appeal to you it gives the watcher a great view at every end of the Earth imaginable in exquisite detail.
0385503954|2.0|After ploughing through Atonement for a book group, I was very disappointed.  The writing is heavy handed, the character development is virtually nonexistent, many of the key characters disappear after the &quot;crime&quot;, and the plot development is thin.  It would have made an interesting short story, but McEwan fills up page after page with irrelevant war experiences of two of the characters that have nothing to do with the plot of the book and stretches an interesting premise into an empty novel.  Atonement for the main character, Briony, is irrelevant since the only two characters who can give her forgiveness, we find out in the last pages, are dead.  Just as the story dwells endlessly inside of the head of immature, fantasy prone, histrionic Briony--her perceived atonement is just as fantastical.  This book is much ado about nothing.  I'm surprised McEwan got such good press.  Perhaps it's because he is a Booker prize winner for a prior work.

0553106635|5.0|I love this series.  Martin has created an extremely rich, layered world with a huge cast of realistically complicated characters, and he is willing to subject all of them to things that could actually happen - things humans have indeed done to each other throughout history.  He has created a different world, but peopled it with the same species we're stuck with on this one.   He is more \\"realistic\\" not only than the fluffy, sweetness-and-light fantasy writers, but also than many \\"gritty\\" writers who write only about unpleasant things and people, whether in an effort to shock, or to be cynical enough for a modern audience, or to be \\"serious writers.\\"  Martin is willing to dedicate the pages and the energy to creating real people and letting them loose.  <br />Some reviewers have complained that they're tired of, or repulsed by, the amount and nature of the ...in these books.  I agree that this is not how many of us choose to think about ..., but I think it does reflect accurately on how the people he's describing engage in and think about it.  A more legitimate complaint is that he doesn't bother describing it when two people who are happily married are enjoying it together.  Maybe that's because he's killed off at least half of each such couple.  But let's remember that the dramatic stuff is always going to get more play than the routine.  There aren't a lot of descriptions of peaceful meals or anything else peaceful in these books.  I'm not sure why we'd expect much of anything to provide sweet, otherworldly respite in these books.  But we can get that in our own lives.<br />Something I would add to the observations of Martin's superb characterization is that I am very impressed by his ability to channel children.  He's captured the fact that while children are ignorant and inexperienced in many respects, many of them can certainly think well and can understand quite complicated aspects of reality.  Arya is smart (though certainly bitter) and resourceful.  Sansa is older, but (frankly) not that bright, and learns more slowly (it's taking her a heck of a long time to get over her romantic delusions).  It's nice to see an author reflecting these real differences rather than treating anyone under 15 as an ... who thinks and speaks in words of one syllable.  <br />Finally, one reviewer thought there was nothing to be learned from these books, no philosophy.  I disagree.  Throughout the books, people make difficult choices among competing loyalties, goals and ideals.  Their choices are not always wise or kind, but it is our job as readers to reflect on this and draw our own conclusions as to what they should have done.  It would be terribly annoying if Martin beat us over the head with his own opinions.  His restraint in this regard should not be interpreted as moral relativism, but as \\"show, don't tell\\" writing.  And the fact that characters are not rewarded properly for their choices reflects real life.  It takes more courage to make moral decisions and tough choices when we believe that we will not be repaid good for good.  After finishing this series, we should be grateful in instances where doing the right thing will actually not lead to our public beheading.
B000002PCS|5.0|I would like to say that I just love the music. After watching the movie, I understood where each part the music was played in. I could just picture the movie in my head when I listen to the soundtrack. I love the soundtrack, the book and movie, they are all great to own. I would recommend this soundtrack to anyone.
B000058983|2.0|I've got a problem with two words used to describe this album. They are Rock and Masterpiece. First, to be called a Rock album an album actually has to rock. This one doesn't. Even the Doors, surely a psychodelic rock band - not a favorite of mine, by the way - rocked - listen to 'light my fire', or 'break on through to the other side' or several of their other well known singles. They show a drive and a passion, and generally encourage the listener to go nod 'yeah yeah' with his head, as all good rock should. Think of big rock bands today, even those you don't particularly like - Beatles, Queen, U2, Led Zeppelin, you name it. Regardless of how much you (dis)respect them, they all know how to rock. Love doesn't.<BR>As for the masterpiece bit - what makes a masterpiece? Well, several things. First of all, a unique sound, a sound that tells you, \\"hey, you're listening to [insert favorite band name here]\\". This album lacks it - it sounds like many other uninspired folk rock album out there. Second of all, timelessness - several tracks on this album have aged considerably. Third, brilliant catchy melodies, such as on Beatles albums or other good 60s albums - but not here. Fourth, excellent lyrics, as in Bob Dylan's or Tom Wait's albums - while some of the lyrics are good, some are plain dumb, especially those about snot (a sublime metaphor indeed). And fifth - intelligent arrangements. Some songs on this albums include a trumpet or strings, but that doesn't qualify them as being any good. They often just sound cheesy.<BR>I'm not saying this is a \\"bad\\" album. Hey, music is subjective. I don't like Celine Dion, but tens of millions do, so who am I to judge them? What I'm trying to say is this: just because some dumb music critics - and some music critics are known not to be the brightest people in the world (I'm talking about people who, e.g., praised The Strokes) - have put this album on their top 100 list, don't be tempted to buy it. Nor should you let the glowing 5 star reviews on Amazon pesuade you to. If you want good proof of the uselessness of most Amazon.com reviews, just try reading the glowing 5-star reviews on various albums YOU can't stand. Then you'll understand what I mean. And remember, always trust your OWN musical taste, not that of critics or the masses.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This movie gives me much peace and quiet in our rowdy household!  My two-year old boy and five-year old girl both sit still through this one, in its entirety.  My two-year old was sick for two days, and he watched it six times during those two days.  He sat still, by himself (sister was at school), and watched it, riveted.  I checked on him while I puttered around straightening things, and he never moved, until the ending credits.  Then, he was up like he was shot out of a gun, dancing around, saying \\"Monster, monster\\".  As is usual with Disney/Pixar, it operates on more than one level.  Observant parents will catch some very funny moments (we can all relate to the work-a-day grind).  The sushi bar is probably my favorite.  Anyway, anything that can quiet my two for longer than five minutes is more than OK in my book!
0440219078|5.0|I read this magnificent piece of art in grade 8 and its just such a beautiful and splendid book. I urge young people to read this, it was one of the best books I have read in my childhood.
0380796090|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel set in the British Isles. As the primary character, Claire had me rooting for her successes and constantly laughing out loud at her antics.  Each time she turns her emotions into characters who are out to confuse and annoy her, I couldn't wait to turn the page and meet more.  Her story was believable and filled with modern examples of being a wife and becoming a mother in this hectic world.  Claire's family is a delight and I am glad that we can meet them again in Marian Keyes' subsequent novels, Rachel's Holiday and Angels.
B00004Z400|4.0|I've seen alot of reviews stating that Deftones are alot like the so called &quot;metal&quot; bands Slipknot, Linkin Park, and Korn, which aren't METAL AT ALL. This is an INSULT to such a great band as the Deftones to be called Nu-Metal.  Deftones are far greater than that on this album.  Not as much screaming or hip hop influences (the reason why I don't like Around The Fur too much.. Only good songs IMO are Be Quiet and Drive and MX) in this album for it to be considered Nu-Metal.  The only nu-metal song here that I really dislike is Elite. I don't see whats so &quot;hard rock&quot; about it. I'm sorry people but screaming over 3 chords on a guitar is not &quot;hard rock&quot;. Other than that, this album is FLAWLESS. Change, Digital Bath, Passenger, and Knife Party are my favorite songs from here, the other songs are good too.<br />Gets 4 stars for having Elite...
B00005QG9J|3.0|Not bad, an average album, only good song is Wish you were here, but if you want something similar to incubus, check out Hoobastank, they are really good.
0380018179|5.0|The Thorn Birds is the best book ever!!! It is completely heartbreaking from the very beginning, and stays that way til the end. What is really interesting is the story of the Thorn Birds at the beginning, which is so much like Meggie's life.The only bad part of the book is Dane, he is so annoying. But I LOVE it anyway, I hope u do too.
B000002J1C|5.0|Yes' third album was the full development of the signature Yes sound, and solidly established Yes as being a progressive rock group as well as establishing the definition of progressive rock.  This album contained the longest compositions from Yes on any of their first three albums, and allowed Yes to fully exploit musical themes.<br />The album kicks off with &quot;Yours Is No Disgrace&quot;, a 9:40 composition exceeded in length rarely in rock music to this point (exceeded by King Crimson and Iron Butterfly and approached by The Moody Blues).  There is a strong jazz influence in this song that benefited from the contributions of all the talented members of the group.  Occasionally some of the riffs sound a bit dated, but the dated portions are balanced by some very experimental music that can be heard in numerous later works by other artists.<br />&quot;The Clap&quot; acoustically follows.  An unusual piece for Yes given that they are known for their lush and complex electricly driven music.  Chet Atkins has been given as an influence for this song.  Perhaps.  The strong acoustic performance is difficult to classify, which by definition makes it somewhat progressive.  Well played guitar.<br />Then comes the epic &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, which was inspired by Robert A. Heinlein's novel of the same name (which has only moderate similarity to the movie of the same name).  I am a great fan of Robert A. Heinlein, but in this case I think the vision of the music has exceeded the vision of the book.  The instruments, including the relatively new Moog synthesizer, handle all of the orchestration, creating a more electronic and soaring symphonic work than those of The Moody Blues, who were previously known for this type of music.  This song was very innovative in its transitions and creation of multiple parts, and set the stage for future progressive groups.  A great piece.<br />&quot;I've Seen All Good People&quot; starts with &quot;Your Move&quot;, which evokes imagery of a chess game.  A cautionary song about relationships and how people behave toward each other.  This song is less epic than &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, but contains catchy hooks and allows sufficient time to explore the musical concept.  The ending of the second part of this piece, &quot;All Good People&quot;, is gorgeous and wonderful, and would be perfectly played with a pipe organ, though the building would be shaking.<br />&quot;A Venture&quot; is a fairly basic and simple song by Yes standards.  This song is closer to the previous Yes albums than the other songs on this album.  Clearly a Yes composition, but the least of the songs on this album.<br />&quot;Perpetual Change&quot; contains elements of the symphonic rock played on some of the earlier tracks, but relies more on the vocals and the lyrics to define the song.  A wonderful addition, this song establishes that the type of music Yes was creating could be progressive in more than one way, expansive instrumentally complex symphonic rock, or vocally complex music with poetic evocative lyrics sewn together by an innovative bridge.<br />Progressive music was one of the numerous types of music to evolve from rock out of the incredibly creative period from 1966 to 1975.  There were clear indications that something was happening with groups like The Moody Blues and King Crimson and their creations of the late 60s and early 70s.  Yes did more than just improve upon what these groups did, they nailed the definition, they allowed us to look back and see that progressive music had been around since 1967, but it took an album like &quot;The Yes Album&quot; to make us realize what had happened even though we were looking for it.gery of a chess game.

B00006JLX4|5.0|Okay, most of you have probably heard &quot;Slanted and Enchanted&quot; and you want to know about the bonus material on this two disc set. Let me first touch on the album itself...Since you probably already know the songs I won't bore you with a description and if you have heard the album you know that not only was it one of the most important albums of the 90's but also one of the most enjoyable (enjoyable and important do not go hand and hand) the reissue however brings everything up a level and the sound improvement alone is enough of a reason to buy the reissued version...now to the bonus material...amazing, every bit as important as the original album, the live stuff shows that not only were Pavement an amazing album band but also just as good live and the Peel sessions are great! Put down the Hives cd, throw away your Strokes albums and go ahead and take you Vines cd to a used store (that is where its going to end up anyways) and go out and buy this...Let it take you back to a time when indie rock was exciting, fresh and original. (If you don't own any other Pavement albums go ahead and pick up all of their albums along with Steve's solo album you won't be disappointed)
6305232660|1.0|The acting is awful, the story without any thrill... there is so much bad I could say about that movie, probably one of the worst I ever saw. I found it so bad and boring that I quit watching it in the middle after the anti-meteorite mission fails. BTW I wonder if there isn't (maybe unintended) some anti-African racism in it as an America depicted here with all top-leaders (president, etc.) being African fails to protect the planet whereas other movies of this kind show European national leaders succeed? I would not expect this from Hollywood though, so I guess it is unintended.<BR>Go and get instead a good comedy like Bulworth. At least you will have some fun, thrill, and food for thought.
B00004TDRD|5.0|In this world of rotten monster movies, where special effects dominate and hideous mutants rip off various limbs and cause havoc... it's nice to go back and be shown how it's really done. Based on Peter Benchley's novel, Speilberg directs masterfully, exhuding masses of tension from his principle trio and obviously from the shark itself. The creature admittadly has its technical limitations, but those are forgiven in the film's brilliant first half, where the shark isn't shown... merely it's camera-view and it's grisly results. This armed with John Williams' unforgettable score will get far more hearts beating than any CGI monster - one scene in particular with a fisherman frantically swimming back to shore as an unseen Jaws (dragging a huge chunk of a bridge) comes towards him. As his feet scrabble up the wood to safety, you'll finally realise how simple Speilberg's techniques are - in simplicity he's got your pulse racing, without too much gore or mess.<BR>   There's a real human element here. These atrocities have consequences (shown by Mrs. Kintner) and we truly care about Brody (Scheider) Hooper (Dreyfuss) and Quinn (Shaw). The film's second half, as our trio head off to kill the shark, leaving the island behind and going pretty much one-on-one with the beast, is tension all the way. This time the shark's involvement is somewhat more visual, demonstrating it's rather bulky appearance... but even so, John Williams helps keep things thumping along. Even the little touches, like Quinn's Indianapolis speech, help put things in perspective and really make us hate the shark. That's what sets this apart, it's not all focusing on the shark, or who it kills... there are people involved, played to perfection by Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw. <BR>   The three sequels could never come close to this, with silly modes of dispatching the shark, lots of standard-sequel added bits and Jaws: The Revenge's ludicrous \\"shark with a grudge\\" concept. It's best just to watch the original, be awed by a fantastic screenplay, some nailbiting direction and economic use of the titular monster, and really see where Hollywood's going wrong these days. Great stuff.
B000002I25|5.0|\\"Break On Through to the Other Side\\" announced Jim Morrison as the first rock shaman laureate. Sure, the Doors were trumped by one Australian 'hillbilly' singer named Rolf Harris, who five years before sang \\"Play yer digeridoo, Blue . . . keep playin' 'til I shoot through\\" in his top ten American hit \\"Tie Me Kangaroo Down\\". The didgeridoo is the instrument the sounds of which send Australian aborigines upon their own shamanic excursions into the Dreamtime (their term for the world of the Spirits). Of course hardly anyone in America was even aware in 1962 as to what a didgeridoo was, nor did American teenagers know about shamans. That lovely old song was (rather unjustly?) marketed as a novelty tune.<br />Of course, the Doors themselves were no novelty in 1967 or any time since.<br />On this, their very first album, there was strength, guts and poetry in every song they sang, played and recorded. Each one creates a different mood, tapping into various deep currents of the collective psyche and parading forth the great mysteries of humanity. Of course The Doors weren't alone in making such efforts. In '67 many were traveling similar paths, delving into and exposing their own deep spiritual and emotional mysteries for us to revel in and learn from. One thinks of Cream's 'Disraeli Gears', Joni Mitchell's 'Song to a Seagull', Procol Harum's first two albums, and Donovan's 'A Gift from a Flower to a Garden', in addition to some of the more obvious examples.<br />The Doors (along with the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Pearls Before Swine) though, were probably the wildest of them all. I omit some of the more \\"self-consciously\\" weird groups who were almost like theatrical parodies of themselves such as Pink Floyd, the Mothers of Invention, and the Fugs, who might have succeeded mainly because of shock value. The Doors, however, really woke us up to moods, feelings, and psychic vistas many of us might not have had the wherewithal to discover on our own. They didn't merely \\"tear the roof off the sucker\\" but dissolved floor and walls as well. And they took their name from a passage in the writings of William Blake, who, over 150 years before, wrote: \\"If the Doors of Perception were cleansed, everything would appear as it is, infinite. For Man has closed himself up, 'til he sees through narrow chinks of his cavern.\\"*<br />The Doors played for our homecoming dance at the University of Michigan in the fall of '67. Yost Field House was packed - no one was bothering to dance, we just watched and listened. Jim was pretty high on something, though it may have just been alcohol. For a while he had to hang on Robbie to keep from toppling over, or at least to help him get his bearings. We all just lapped it up.<br />The other time I saw them was at Masonic Auditorium in Cleveland, probably in '69 or '70; I was with my girlfriend Janice [she is the one whom the chorus of \\"We Could Be So Good Together\\" has always reminded me of]. Jim was running/jumping back and forth on stage with a fifth of Smirnoff (?) - it wasn't a pretty sight. His aura of mystery and his centeredness had by that time pretty much deserted him.<br />It made us feel a sense of sadness, not disgust - sad for ourselves, not just for him. Even before the debacle at Altamont, it signaled the beginning of an end to the perfect dream so many shared in the late sixties. Believe me, we felt that those dreams would never end; unfortunately, they did. We saw he was lost - and felt it was our personal tragedy as well.<br />All this aside, please buy this CD - you'll really get into it.<br />[* From his 'The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'.

B00005O3VC|5.0|The subtitles have a life of their own.  On and off willy nilly. There doesn't seem much one can do about it except show the subtitles and tape a piece of newsprint over the lower part of the screen.  Otherwise a great film.
B00006F7S4|5.0|This is the album I knew Beck always had in him.<BR>Don't walk, RUN to the record store and buy this instant classic at once.<br />'nuff said.
B00005JKDR|4.0|Finally badged my Husband into renting it, and he loved it as well.  There is nothing so grand as a kids movie that's actually enjoyable for adults.<br />The shorts included in the DVD are also hysterical, we must have seen the birds on a wire clip five or six times before we returned the movie.<br />Great stuff! ^_^
B00006J9OT|5.0|Bought this CD yesterday after I read that she had a live version of &quot;A Case of You&quot; I saw Ms. Krall in San Francisco this past May where she performed this song and I tell you that this song was so moving that you could literally hear a pin drop.<br />I have played this CD from Track 1 through Track 12 at least 3 times since I bought it last night, then brought it to work to burn on my CD here so I could listen to it. If that doesn't tell you it's worth buying I don't know what does. As I say in all of my music reviews everyone has their own &quot;ear&quot; for music. I happen to LOVE Diana's music and unlike several other reviewers on here... I do &quot;get&quot; her and really enjoy her husky voice. Seeing her live was such a pleasure it really made me appreciate this fine Songstress. I come from a family of entertainers I grew up with a brother that was always on stage and I got to see/hear some quality performances as I grew up so when I say her CD WOWED me, it did.<br />I have at least 5 of Ms. Krall's recordings and I can't say that I liked this one anymore than I liked her last but I can say that if you have her previous CD's you won't be dissapointed in purchasing this one as well.<br />Respectfully Reviewed
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Jokes for kids, joke for adults, an actual -plot- *gasp!* and some of the best animation I've seen in a while.  Maybe it's not as flashy as Final Fantasy : Spirit's Within, but it's certainly a notch higher up the ladder than Toy Story (did I mention the -plot-?)<br />If you have kids, if you don't have kids, as long as you have a sense of humor... go rent or buy this one! ^_^  The fuzzy donkey outtakes alone are worth the price of a Blockbuster rental...
B00003CX9Q|2.0|The only good thing about this special edition is that the original movie is on the second disk. Granted, I did enjoy some of the added scenes with E.T., but overall the digital removal of weapons in the film is an insult to those of us who know how to raise our kids properly and can teach them the difference between real and fake and right or wrong. And also, the removal of weapons destroys the element of fear and belief in the reality side of the film. I mean come on... making friends with an extra terrestrial is more believeable than feeling threatened by cops weilding walkie talkies!
0380002930|4.0|Well, I loved this book well enough in grade school, and junior high, but by the end of High School the re-readability was just about nil.<br />While the story itself is grand, the barely hidden commentary on human societies gets a little annoying (once you realize what you are reading).  Much like Narnia, this book started to loose interest as soon as I realised what the Author was tying to do.<br />Ah, to be young again... ^_~
0060007737|3.0|I don't know. To me it just seems much too easy to wait for a company to fail and then analyze and formulate certainties about why it failed. Conversely it's much to easy to do the same for a company that succeeds. I have yet to see anybody make projections about companies that are executing certain branding tactics RIGHT NOW!!! If these laws are immutable then we should clearly be able to find more than a handful of companies that have mutated these laws and say \\"Yes they will fail.\\"<BR>My feeling is that these laws and bits of certainties apply only to the past. And since the past can't be modified neither can the laws that are applied to them. But what about laws for the future? And can branding and marketing laws for the future even exist? Probably not. Because, and I'm sure most marketing guru's will agree, the tastes and preferences of consumers are anything but immutable. They change all the time. Even our ability to recieve and process information quite frankly depends on our mood - and I make that statement as a consumer and not as a Advertising specialist.<br />I would not classify these ideas of this book as laws, but more as considerations. They are things to consider when making choices about a Brand Strategy. We can analyze to high heaven about why a Brand will pass or fail, but in the end it will depend on the fickle desires of the consumer. We do our best to forecast, but even the weatherman has screwed up a \\"Bright and Sunny\\" forecast on what resulted in a Rainy and Miserable day.<BR>Consumers are no different. And it is improbable if not impossible that we will ever lock down End-All-Be-All laws that will encapsulate the \\"Whatever\\" attitude of the public.
B00003CXI1|5.0|A great match for the books (although I'd still take the books over the movies any day) and a fun watch.  Even got a few non-Potter friends to sit down and see some of it.  Always nice to make converts. ^_~<br />Now if I could only get my books back...
B000002UAO|5.0|This album marked a change in The Beatles ad people and songwriters. The uncut british album that is on cd that is. John and Paul's songwriting was getting more personal, more poetic, and far away from the SHE LOVE ME PLEASE PLEASE ME etc type of song. Bob Dylan and drugs were big inspirations. Unlike the american edition the cd rights some wrongs by including the whole uncut album, so you have songs that have dark twists.<BR>  This was the first album where they were experimenting with new sounds. George brought a sitar into the studio on NORWEGIAN WOOD and added another dimension to there sound and the song. This also marked a departure for John AND Paul a song about an affair that goes wrong so the guy sets fire to her house. IN MY LIFE is another one of the standout tracks. Theres alot of debate with John and Paul on who actually wrote it or how much they wrote but in any case when they do the song it always brings a tear to my eye. It is hard writting reviews to an album your so passionate about The Beatles were a great band. I'm a Beatlemaniac. But even I can admit that they have some weak albums. This is the first album they did where they thought of the album as a whole and not just good individual tracks.
0684853523|5.0|When I first got this book, I chucked it aside; because, the first half of it was all about Stephen King; maybe, a lot of you like that; but I think he's too much of a setting oriented writer; and I get board reading his stuff; so naturally, I didn't want to hear about his life. <BR>Well, I discovered after about a month that the last half of the book was his writing advice. Pay Dirt-Literally! It's like my writing devotional; the insights he gives on writing are absolutely brilliant and down to earth, NOT things like 'write with a clearer perspective'-Hu?! Each of his insights are simple and useable like: 'try writing with music on.' Nothing difficult or elusive, just ideas that have helped make him one of America's greatest living writers. Anyone who writes or wants to write should read this book; whether or not you like King's writing.<BR>I so thank Stephen King for writing this book. It's the best.
B00005YXZH|5.0|First off thank you reprise records for releasing Wilco from the label. Because you did that, we real music fans that don't like Linkin park and that ilk can here one of the most creative albums in ages. And to the fans of Wilco(and I have followed them since A.M.)that don't like this because it is not alt-country that's o.k. Ryan Adams is doing a good job with that so move onto him. Jeff Tweedy is a genius and he and Jay Bennett were like a modern day Lennon&McCartney. What ever pains it took them to make this album is worth it. I can't really talk about individual tracks because the album is men't to be heard as a whole. \\"Jesus etc.\\" is such a beautiful song with beutiful string fills it really is a song that I think can heal wounds after 9/11. \\"Poor places\\" is one of my favorites with the feed back ending and the sort of prog rock gone psycho attiude on the song. The sonic experiments on this album don't seem out of place unlike Radiohead's \\"KID A\\" that at times seems to forgo songs for just experiments and nothing else at times and it seems boring. Like special effects in a movie with out a story. The experimentation should be used as a tool and not the whole song. Wilco use all of this as a part of the songs as well as creating a whole mood for the album. I think my generation has been waiting for are own \\"SGT. PEPPER\\" or \\"REVOLVER\\". With music today being so fragmented and all about selling \\"product\\" and what mtv tells you to buy. How much longer can people listen to Britney and The rap rock. So because of all of that we don't have that defining album of the moment that will change the course of music for the next 20 years.....well we do but not that many people care if mtv does not tell you to buy it. This album is a masterpiece that deserves to be on that list of great albums and with modern masterpieces as well.
B00005NZJX|5.0|Profanity or no profanity the CD is great!!
B000002UWW|5.0|awsome! my favourite chilly peppers cd. tracks like backwoods, fight like a brave, behind the sun, show me your soul etc are some of the funkyest most awesome tracks the peppers have ever produced.. if your a fan of their 90z stuff this is a MUST HAVE CD!
B00005JL3A|4.0|I knew that this movie was based on a computer game that my husband and his friends played, so I was a little hesitant about seeing it. I had heard it got bad reviews when it was in the theaters and thought maybe they were right. However I was interested in a movie where a woman kicks a lot of booty and saves the day. <BR>Was I surprised!!!! This movie is so great! Its fun to watch and suspensful enough to keep you on the edge of your seat in many scenes. The gore factor is pretty high, but thats fine with me. <BR>The score to this movie is also AMAZING!! Im a huge Marilyn Manson fan and the soundtrack to the movie is just incredible! He really outdid himself, even my friends who do not like Marilyn Manson music liked the score to this movie. <BR>Ive seen this movie twice in a one month period and hope for a sequel! See it, its a fun movie and you wont be dissapointed.
B000003TA4|4.0|WHAT??! how can anyone possibly NOT give this anything but 5 stars?? this is without a doubt the best alt rock album of the 90z if not ever. nevermind the rest, this IS THE BEST!
B00000DC10|5.0|you dont like good music. you will not like this oldie but goodie, but i do.
B000067CPX|4.0|Why did the chilly peppers make a cd like this?? btw is a good cd in that every track has its merits, but overall this cd is quite bland. This cd sounds more pop than anything.. not a bad cd but a loong looooooong way from chilly peppers at their best. flea trademark baselines are non-existent!! why?!! a lot of the tracks sound too weird to get into.. anywayz i only recommend this cd to die hard chilly peppers fans (like myself). if your just getting into the peppers for gods sake buy these 3 cds: californication, blood sugar sex majik and their What hits? compilation cd.. or if just one cd get cali.. oh and mothers milk (if you have the cash).. well, thats just my 2 cents
B00006F1IJ|5.0|What can I say, if you love the smell of a fresh spring morning, to gaze at a full moon on a crips fall night, to watch trees dance in the wind on a warm summer day or just love the places the music takes you, take one listen. This album can't replace those feelings, &quot;but dame if it does't come close.&quot;
B000002MTR|5.0|this cd is really, really good. more of a hardish rock album on the same lines as califorication.. but without Sir John Frushiante :( still that dude from janes addiction is still a pretty awesome guitarist.. a slightly misdirected and wierdish album but the singles aeroplane and my friends are great!  overall this album is still very very good! not as replayable as californication and bssm, but a very refreshing change to those 2 if your a fan.
0783113943|4.0|I am not sure she could do anything wrong in my eyes in the way of acting that is. And I could die for those lips. Good movie better on DVD you can then watch it as much as you like, with extra plus parts.
B00005A1PR|4.0|Ms. Arie is mellow and filled with messages for her listeners. She's another favorite of mine to listen to while relaxing.
6304342160|5.0|Can we say hot or what? This keep me glued to my seat not pee breaks for me. This was a keeper.
B000067CPX|4.0|Definitely a different angle for the Peppers, but not at all out of place following Californication.  It took a couple of listens for the song hooks to sink in, but now that I've heard the CD many times, the songs just stay in your head.  This is great music from one of the best bands still actually making REAL music, not processed synthesized ... .  Loved the albums they made when they were younger, and love the mature work too!
B00005JL1C|5.0|This 80's John Hughes gem wasn't as popular as some of his other movies (Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Pretty In Pink), which is a shame because it's every bit as good as those flicks, if not better.  The plot of Pretty In Pink is sort of rehashed here: a teen from the poor side of town (Eric Stoltz subbing for Molly Ringwald), has got eyes for a popular teen (Lea Thompson subbing for Andrew McCarthy), and has a free-thinkin', seemingly gay best friend of the opposite gender (Mary Stuart Masterson subbing for Jon Cryer) that winds up being the person they should end up with.  There's even the token jerk that causes problems for everyone (Craig Sheffer subbing for James Spader.)  <br />The original ending of Pretty In Pink was changed after test audiences said they would rather Molly Ringwald's character end up with Andrew McCarthy's, instead of Jon Cryer's.  (Wrong! At least in my opinion.)  They got it right in \\"Some Kind Of Wonderful.\\"  What a great 80's teen flick this is!  Not too sappy, not too dramatic- everything gets balanced out with little drops of humor here and there.  Candace Cameron is hilarious in every one of her scenes (check her out as Eric Stoltz's younger sister before she wound up on TV's migraine headache inducing \\"Full House\\"); so is Maddie Corman who plays the middle sister.  (She later ended up on Margaret Cho's short lived \\"All American Girl\\" sitcom and was in another GREAT 80's teen flick called \\"Seven Minutes in Heaven\\" which also starred Jennifer Connelly.)  <br />If you love this movie, or are a fan of the John Hughes genre, you should also check out the \\"Some Kind Of Wonderful\\" soundtrack.  It's every bit as GREAT as the \\"Pretty In Pink\\" soundtrack.  The opening credits sequence music from \\"Some Kind Of Wonderful\\" (\\"Abuse\\" by Propaganda) is not on the cd, but is available on Propaganda's \\"Wishful Thinking\\" cd.  <br />The only issue I have with this DVD is the same issue I have with a lot of other ParamountDVD's: no extra goodies.  No trailer, no outtakes, no deleted scenes, no commentary.  That is disappointing, but it's still great to have this on DVD finally.
B000060P79|5.0|This CD is the best ever.  I love it so much.  Simple Plan is a great band.  They are very talented.  They write all of their own music.  It's also really cool that Mark Hoppus from Blink 182 and Joel Madden from Good Charlotte make apperances on this CD. It's great because the songs don't sound all the same. There is a wonderful variety.
6305126062|5.0|I am a 15 years old boy from Sweden and the most films I see is Action and Thrillers but one day my sister saw her new film &quot;Mannen som kunde tala med hstar&quot; (on Swedish). And I look on it and it was the most beautiful film I ever seen. The musik and the nature in Montana is so good. I have seen the film almost 10 times and gonna see it more times, but one day in my life I gonna se Montana and go there. This film is good and dont say it was bad becose it`s not. Dont waiss this film.<BR>Very good job MR.Booker (Robert Redford). It is the best film you ever done.
B00003CXAE|5.0|I have seen this movie one hundred times and still cannot get enough of it. Everytime I see it is like seeing for the first time. Yes some of the plot is kind of stereotypical but it doesn't matter because the songs and the actors more than make up for it. I would recommend this movie to everyone even if you'd neve seen a musical.
B00003CX8Y|2.0|They converted the movie to all computer generated, including the &quot;new&quot; scenes. The pixels are awful on the DVD. You can see the color seperation. After you notice, it is hard to ignore. otherwise the same great movie as always.

B00006JL1Z|4.0|This is a solid collection of Fleetwood Mac's material in the Buckingham/Nicks era, but for long time fans this is probably overkill. Most of us have all of these songs on the Greatest Hits CD (1988) or the Chain - 25 years collection (1992). While it is great to hear the radio edits of &quot;Rhiannon&quot; and &quot;Sisters of the Moon,&quot; I think the DVD audio CD of &quot;Rumours&quot; is a better bet. The DVD contains the original version of &quot;Silver Springs&quot; and you hear more of the mix because of the 5.1 sound. It was unnecessary to include the mediocre material recorded after Buckingham's 1987 departure, although the live version of &quot;Go Insane&quot; was good to hear. I  look forward  to the 2003 release of FM's new album.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|This edition contains both the original and retouched version of the film; both versions have their ups and downs - I loved the new bathroom scene!  2 DVDs, some extras, and a nice package - not to mention the fact that its one of the greatest movies of all time!  Buy it NOW :P
B000002NHN|5.0|Time was suspended. The air was electric with excitement and the threat of raindrops. The atmosphere this overcast Sunday morning in October 2002 was magical and transported all gathered there to a medieval time and place. The Raleigh Rose Garden had been transformed into a Celtic glade with colorful banners around the circular fountain filled with umbrella palms and water lilies. The Roses were abloom and their scent enchanting. The bell was rung three times to signal the beginning of the ceremony. The guests were welcomed and the bridegroom and his groomsmen entered from four directions. Celtic music swelled (The Mummer's Dance by Loreena McKennitt) and expanded, uplifting all spirits watching in awe as the bride and her father slowly and majestically swept down the white canvas-covered aisle. Tears seeped from the eyes of the groom as he watched his bride come forth. The bride, beautiful in an ordinary way, became a raving beauty in her full flowing beaded gown and ring of multi-colored flowers encircling her head. With their hands clasped together forming the symbol of infinity their hands were bound with a red cord representing the sacred bond of marriage. And so bound the couple said their vows, the groom barely able to utter all the words he had written. The rings were blessed with air, fire, salt, and water. The groom seemed under a spell of confusion as he insisted on putting the ring on the bride's right hand-later corrected. The couple symbolically drank wine from the cup of life. The guests promised to support the couple's married life and prayed The Lord's Prayer together with the couple. After the pronouncement, in a glass-breaking custom so ancient that the origin remains unknown, the couple together smashed the glass from which they had drunk the wine promising to love each other until the fragments came back together.  There was not just one kiss but many before the couple proceeded back down the aisle amid cheers and applause as once again the magical Celtic music swelled in celebration!
B00006AG5N|5.0|Even for the non-Elvis lover, these 31 songs are a great collection of Elvis's greatest hits.  I would receommend to anybody this CD.
B0000640VO|5.0|Jeunet has done it again, this time apparently without the help of his usual partner, Marc Caro.  <br />Amelie is a perfectly French film, demonstrating the French knack for finding beauty in the mundane and accepting human frailty.  Poor little Amelie grew up with somewhat loving but eccentric and unapproachable parents.. Her childhood social life and family situation has made her into a painfully shy but compassionate young woman.  She has retained her childish way of finding likes and dislikes -- another French specialty? -- and instead of making judgments on practical bases, she makes decisions with her intuition.  She intuits her role in life, her lovelife -- you'd guess she probably picked her place of residence based on the grain of wood on the balustrade.  <br />This is a character you will root for; you will talk to her as she struggles with her bizarre insecurities; you will applaud her clever mischief; your heart will ache joyfully when she succeeds in her first mission of giving meaning to another person.. (you'll know what I mean when you see it) I have to say, if you don't care about this beautiful creature, your heart is defective.  <br />All that aside, Jeunet works his usual magic with stop-motion, animation, slow-mo, various effects, highly stylized dream sequences put into documentary format.  Of course the performances are all perfect as usual, and there is at least one &quot;usual suspect&quot; on the credits.  <br />I was foolish enough to miss this one in the theatre, but luckily decided to take the time to see it on DVD..  Do yourself a favor and do the same if you have not seen it..
B00005J6T0|5.0|One of the most interesting American pop culture phenomenons of 1986 was the conviction of so many people that the Madonna song \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" (written by Brian Elliot with additional lyrics by Madonna) was an anti-abortion song.  Certainly I can appreciate the idea that Madonna, whose public persona from the start was always closer to libertine than liberal, could be co-opted to represent conservative (nee traditional) family values.  But all you have to do is read the lyrics of the song to see that this makes no sense.\\"  The pivotal line from the chorus is (altogether now) \\"But I made up my mind, I'm keeping my baby.\\"  Now, this is simple: the opposite of \\"keeping\\" your baby, is giving it up for adoption.  The opposite of having an abortion would have been \\"having\\" your baby.  This not even a close call and is right up there with President Reagan quoting Bruce Springsteen's \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" as evidence of American pride (again, the lesson is easy, just read the lyrics).<br />Anyhow, \\"True Blue\\" was the third Madonna album and constituted a major makeover at least in terms of image (...); the change in her choice of music lagged behind a bit.  You still have \\"dance\\" numbers like \\"Where's the Party\\" and there is usually a strong dance rhythm to many of the songs, but Madonna is also starting to move in other directions.  \\"La Isla Bonita\\" offers a bit of Latino flair, but I have always thought \\"Live to Tell\\" was the key track on this album.  The video matched the essence of the song: this is Madonna relying on her voice rather than her moves.  She has never had a great voice and it was always a question of what she could do with it; on this song, really for the first time, she shows that she can be a singer rather than just a performer.<br />How much have things changed since this album was first released?  Well, it is dedicated to \\"My husband, the coolest guy in the universe.\\"  More importantly, enough time has passed that I can listen to the title track without cringing as hundreds and hundreds of music videos parade through my mind.  Thank goodness MTV did not do that to one of the really good songs on this album.  Finally, the bonus tracks are a split decision.  I am not going to overjoyed to hear a LONGER version of \\"True Blue (The Color Mix)\\" but the Extended Remix of \\"La Isla Bonita\\" is a keeper.without cringing as hundreds and hundreds of music videos parade through my mind.

B00005JKJA|5.0|An excellent film.  Though I understand it completely I can also relate to those who do not.  Try watching it twice back to back, I think you will then understand.  As far as a review goes:  David Lynch's style is hypnotic.  Also extremely creepy (those old people...eek).  Naomi Watt's performance is amazing, though it may not seem so at first...keep with it.  An excellent movie to watch on the upcoming halloween night.  Something about me always associated Lynch with Halloween.
B00005AREQ|5.0|When I had listened to both Blow by Blow and Wired, I thought Wired was released first.  The sound is rawer and less funky, less melodic.  Blow by Blow comes across as more polished and accessible.  Max Middleton mostly plays the Fender Rhodes here, whereas Wired uses a lot more synthesizer. Orchestral arrangements (mostly strings) throughout provide some nice sonic backdrops.  Phil Chen on Bass and Richard Bailey on drums are a tight combination.  Every track is a winner on this disc.  A great introduction to Beck's unique style of guitar.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I wasn't sure what to make of this anime movie but I was wonderfully suprise.The voice dubbing was excelent and I loved the art work.
6305014140|2.0|Yet again we have an excellent film (definitely among the best of all anime films) that has suffered at the hands of DVD editors. What makes the editing even more bizarre is that the scenes removed (I checked each omission against the full, VHS version)were neither gratuitous nor explicit, almost as if the scenes were cut for 'running time' reasons! There should be a law against releasing films without a warning about the cuts. Afterall, as soon as even a single minute of footage is removed post-release, it is no longer the original film, whether it be for censorship, running-time, director's cut or whatever. Get the VHS version, and ignore this DVD release.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I was skeptical of getting this item since there was only two episoeds. A friend pershased it for me and I was suprised!It had lots of extra fottege,and it was gret watching it without all the chmerical breaks to.:D
B00000IBRI|5.0|~First off I'm a movie buff, but I gonna spare the readers of these reviews the mind numbing anilitical crap that fills most of all other reviews. Here are the reasons why this movie flat out rocks!<br />1. An excellent blend of horror,suspence and thriller.<br />2.Utterly unique and interesting plot and story.<br />3. Cool 80's metal/hard rock soundtrack featuring Iron Maiden, Motorhead etc.<br />4. Errie and very unique score.<br />5. Good acting especially by Donald Pleseance<br />6. If this movie is overdubbed(as~~ is the case with almost all Italian horror movies) you cant tell.<br />7. Last but least, the movie is actually a bit frightining.~
B000069AUI|3.0|This is a pretty good band but I feel they've been played up way too much in the press. The lead singer has a bit of a wimpy voice, but that's not really a problem. You have to wonder if he'd sound the same if Dave Mathews never existed. The similarities between their voices and singing styles are undenyable. Radiohead, who has obviously had a big influence on this band (they've acknowledged as much) is better musically and far more innovative. The first Coldplay single, \\"In My Place,\\" is pretty good. However the only song on the album that really impressed me was \\"Clocks.\\" Other songs are less impressive with repetitive song structures and other qualities that I've heard just too much already. If I hadn't, I'm sure I'd dig this a lot more.
B0000009OU|5.0|I happened upon a leftover copy of the Rykodisc re-issue of This Year's Model after it had gone out-of-print one day at Borders. Happy I had found this hard-to-find gem (this was a while before the new 2-CD re-issues), I purchased the album and popped it in my car stereo. <BR>Costello opens the disc proclaiming &quot;I don't wanna kiss you, I don't wanna touch&quot; before the Attractions explode into a fit of pop-punk rage. I was blown away. The production was crisp, rich, and full of unbridled chaotic energy. Even when Costello slows it down on this album (&quot;Little Triggers&quot;), the result is no less energetic or passionate. Other such classics include &quot;Pump It Up,&quot; &quot;I Don't Wanna Go To Chelsea,&quot; and &quot;This Year's Girl. The Attractions are a much stronger band than Clover, who accompained Costello on My Aim Is True, thus making This Year's Model the stronger album (although My Aim Is True is still classic). The bonus tracks are also nice including the indispensible &quot;Radio, Radio,&quot; a biting, vicious attack on radio. <BR>This is essential listening. Please purchase.
B00006G8LB|3.0|The year's supposed Blockbuster hit \\"Spider-man\\" was neither high-ranking nor low-ranking on my list. <br />I personally loved movies based on comic characters and honestly, seeing \\"Spider-man\\" gave me that 50/50 feeling of whether I liked it or not. <br />Tobey Maguire was a perfect fit for the role of Peter Parker/Spiderman. And so was Willem Dafoe and that other dark-haired fella. Even the lady who portrayed Parker's...aunt was it?...she even gave one hell of a performance. Which character gave a rather ::blech:: performance? Kirsten Dunst, that's who. <br />The lady who portrayed the character of Mary-Jane was nothing but a mere \\"the-film-could-have-done-better-without-her\\" role. With the occassional screams and shrieks all topped off with the cheesy way of saying, \\"I love you Peter Parker\\" in the end...I'm sorry, was I suppose to be touched at this part? Maybe if Ms. Dunst tried not to TRY so hard at acting, maybe then she'll be a formidable lady to portray Mary-Jane. <br />As far as the actions were concerned. It's good, but I've seen better. Don't get me wrong; it was very well done, it's just that...seemed like I've seen one specific move near the end of the movie in the middle of the movie...get it? It seemed like the actions were played in a loop, causing me to lose that \\"edge-of-my-seat\\" awe of what was being shown in the big screen. <br />So for those who doesn't really care much for the actual content of the movie and is just there to see SPIDEY fly...I'm sure you'll enjoy this movie...but for those seeking theatrical works and amazing ingenuity...look for it somewhere else.
B000002UAU|5.0|Best Beatles ablum, w/ white album and abbey road probably coming in next, and for the same reason, because each shows the Beatles at their most versatile and most capable.  The early Beatles had the rhythm and the catchy songs, but the later years showed the artists flourishing, and the chemistry was great (much better together at that time than each could later acheive individually).  The Beatles had many great albums, but the eclectic and adventurous nature of this album paid off to make it the best.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of brothers takes you on an epic journey of what it was like to be a U.S. Soldier in World War II. We follow Easy Company in the 506th of the 101st Airborne division of the U.S. Army. From their formation and training to the deployment in Europe and trial under fire. This is a true account of what our men went through. The realism of these productions is astounding. You feel like you are watching friends in a documentary. D-Day through the end of the war.... Chilling! If you have never been to War, this series may help you understand that every person who goes to war should be considered a hero. No wants to be there, but they do what is required.    Buy this DVD; you will watch this series over and over again...
B00000253N|5.0|It's a bit ridiculous of me to review this after 185 reviews, but I think it is Dylan's best album.  It doesn't have the standard Dylan &quot;hits&quot;, but this introspective, thoughtful album is his best work, and strongest collection of songs.  A true artistic expression.  Thanks Mr. Zimmerman!
B000002GA8|3.0|Got to admit, this CD was a disappointment.  It's not as good as I remember, sure the music is the same, but the production value is poor.  <br />I would have liked a much cleaner version of this classic.
B00000K0DK|5.0|Five stars aren't enough for this Tour-de-force from the prodigy of radio, stage, and the theatre, the incomparable Welles.  <BR>The camera innovations, story structure, and screenplay are wonderous.  A real leap of the imagination for the time, this is undoubtably the best movie ever (at least for the U.S., we won't be too presumptious)!
B00005Y228|5.0|Wow, has Kylie Minogue grown up from doing &quot;The Locomotion!&quot; Powerful dance beats and great lyrics will keep the party going all night long. Highly recommended for people who like dance and/or electronica.
6301942647|5.0|With the Seven Samurai in second, and many other outstanding efforts (including Hidden Fortress, Rashomon, Ran, Kagemusha), I'm giving this flic the top spot.  A wonderful montage of feeling and mood, Kurosawa gives us a cinematic panoramic.<BR>A movie for a contemplative mood, this is Kurasawa's entreaty to humanity, and gift to the world.  Thanks Akira, you've had a wonderful life!
B00000DG1R|3.0|This offers Duran Duran's biggest hits of their career. The better ones being &quot;Ordinary World&quot;, &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; and &quot;Rio.&quot; Although Duran Duran were definite pioneers in the MTV era, their music is not all that appealing *at least to me.* However, if you are a fan, this is a great buy. And even if you are a casual fan it's worth checking out for a few of the tracks which are definite pop music staples.
B000002I4S|5.0|This album turned me on to Coltrane, and still remains my favorite album by him.  Even though I'm only an informal musician and an armchair jazz enthusiast, this difficult music makes sense to me in a way that more &quot;avant garde&quot; material doesn't.  This music stretches the boundaries, but still seems to keep a logic and feel that is appealing to the untrained ear.<BR>Power, tone, and speed are in balance, and hearing his multitudes of variations on each piece is fascinating in a way that transcends the repetition.  A timeless monument to jazz!
B000050XEI|5.0|Although many Enya fans consider this a step downfrom some of her earlier material, I find it just as good *if not better.* Of course, everyone is familiar with &quot;Only Time.&quot; It was a huge hit late last year and even made the top 10 on the pop charts. Not bad for a New Age artist. But &quot;Only Time&quot; isn't even the best song. That goes to the breathtaking &quot;Fallen Embers.&quot; Enya's voice is gorgeous on this track and this song is a tear-jerker if ever I heard one. The &quot;Day Without Rain&quot; instrumental is also pretty. &quot;Wild Child&quot; and &quot;Flora's Secret&quot; are definite stand-outs. And one can't leave out &quot;Pilgrim.&quot; Yet again, wonder vocals and gorgeous melody. This album is 6x platinum in the US and Enya's bestselling album so far in her career *just ahead of Shepherd Moons.* Obviously it has something.
B000002OZY|5.0|With all respect to Quadrophenia (and to a lesser extent Who's next and Who by numbers), this is the ultimate Who album.<BR>A brilliant gamble to Pete Townsend, an epic thematic album with tenderness, cruelty, and inventiveness.  Can you imagine anyone making an album like this now.  This is when people could dream a dream.   Thanks Pete!
079213690X|5.0|Braveheart (1995) is an excellent movie.  Mel Gibson not only stars in the film, but also directs it.  Braveheart won five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director.  Gibson plays William Wallace, a 13th-century Scottish commoner who is terribly evoked causing him to begin an all out war with the cruel English King, Edward the Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan).  The passion that Gibson displays for freedom throughout the film is overwhelming.  <br />The scenery in the film is beautiful.  The battle scenes are brutal.  The emotion for love and loss is enormous.  This epic will go down as a classic that people will enjoy for many years.<br />This film will keep you glued to your seat.  From the very fist scene to the amazing ending, you will never bore.  The emotion that prevails during the entire film is enough to keep you interested.  The entire story is based on the battle for Freedom, and the huge rebellion the Scots cast on the Brits.  Love, loss, patriotism, and passion work close enough on a small scale to grab the heart of every viewer.<br />I have seen clips of this film on TV in the past, but never the film in its entirety.  I had never seen the beginning of this film prior to renting it over the weekend.  The edited version that is seen on television does not do this film justice.  I rate this film so strongly, because I am not a big believer in graphic blood and gore, but I could truly see past that to the beauty this film beholds.  <br />There is enormous controversy about the historical inaccuracies of this film.  Put those aside and view this movie for is slight humor, suprise twists, and the fabulous ending.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Probably my second fav Dylan to Blood on the Tracks, and his best work in a decade.  Defintely a stronger, more eclectic and satisfying than the commendable Time out of Mind.  Bob delves into rock, blues, country, r&amp;b, swing, 1930s-40s standards, and everything else.  A true folk album, Bob delivers his slice of americana, an amazing amalgam only a great artist can offer.  Thanks for continueing to seek out new frontiers Bob!
B000001DQI|5.0|By 1973, Elton John & Bernie Taupin had already logged enough hits to become a part of rock history, but even as their fanbase continued to grow, they hadn't yet reached their peak. When HONKY CHATEAU became Elton's first #1 album in 1972, it proved that he was not just someone FM radio played all the time, even AM listeners (and the biggest single-buyers) had taken notice as well. Continuing with the breakneck pace of his early `70s days, Elton turned up DON'T SHOOT ME I'M ONLY THE PIANO PLAYER early in '73 & won his first #1 single with \\"Crocodile Rock\\". Whether or not, Elton & Bernie had a sudden burst of creativity or wanted to give their fans more bang for their buck, they decided to make the next LP a double, which as rock history has dictated many times before, is almost a no-win situation. Rarely has a double album been great with every single song & needless to say, Elton & Bernie's certainly wasn't. But even their lesser songs were still darn good, making GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD not only their crowning achievement, but a good example of how a double album should be made.<br />Right from the grandiose opener, Elton & Bernie certainly did their homework on the ways of a double album. \\"Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding\\" shows the influence of progressive rock on music of the time with its spacey synthesizer intro (not done by Elton) before leading into the piano-pounding rocker that details the end of a love affair in musical terms. Naturally, this had to have made one hell of an opener in Elton's concerts of this period & even when you just listen to it now, you can almost hear the possibilities for a stage performance of this song.<br />After that opening, ROAD takes the listener on many twists & turns through just about every conceivable genre of music that inspired Elton & Bernie throughout their careers up until that point. They namecheck reggae on \\"Jamaica Jerk-Off\\" (which sure is catchy, but not one you listen to a lot), R&B on the #1 hit \\"Bennie & The Jets\\" (it was also a hit on R&B stations, as well), Stones-based rock & misogyny on \\"Dirty Little Girl\\", more prog rock on the Yes-inspired \\"Grey Seal\\" & 1950s rock on \\"Your Sister Can't Twist [But She Can Rock & Roll]\\" (best when played as a segue to \\"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\\"). Occasionally, some songs sound better musically than lyrically, but you'd be a fool not to enjoy yourself either way.<br />But through all the genre experiments, there are still the perfect melodies & intelligent lyrics that have always been Elton & Bernie's fortes & ROAD still has plenty of those to spare. These include the #2 hit title track, the Marilyn Monroe tribute \\"Candle In The Wind\\" (a song that sounds good in both versions, believe it or not!), the heartbreaking closer \\"Harmony\\" (which has just that, beautiful harmonies equal to the Beach Boys) & cinematic epics like \\"I've Seen That Movie Too\\", \\"Ballad Of Danny Bailey [1909-34]\\" & \\"Roy Rogers\\".<br />Even with the hectic schedule Elton & Bernie put themselves on back in the 1970s, maybe a panoramic statement like GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD didn't seem all that impossible. But the fact it was Elton's second album of the year made it all the more astounding. With 3 major hit singles (the title track, \\"Bennie & The Jets\\" & \\"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\\") & considerable airplay for about all the other songs on here, ROAD's runaway success was more than justified. While the follow-up would indicate maybe the duo had written themselves out, GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD still showed Elton John & Bernie Taupin at the top of their respective games & even today, it's something they should still be enormously proud of.ie & The Jets\\" (it was also a hit on R&B stations, as well), Stones-based rock & misogyny on \\"Dirty Little Girl\\", more prog rock on the Yes-inspired \\"Grey Seal\\" & 1950s rock on \\"Your Sister Can't Twist [But She Can Rock & Roll]\\" (best when played as a segue to \\"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting\\").

B00006AG5N|5.0|The people attacking Elvis Presley should understand what this forum is designed to do . . . that is to critique the CD - the MUSIC. If you do not like Elvis Presley - more power to you, but don't make stupid remarks about the man. Again, this forum is about the MUSIC. This is a 5 star CD in ALL categories. The sound, the content and the impact these songs had on, not only American music, but music all over the world.  \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" is so crisp and the vocals are so \\"up front\\" that you would swear Elvis was singing to you in your own living room.  \\"Don't be cruel\\" is a classic in any decade.  \\"Hound dog\\" is FINALLY on CD transferred at the correct speed (faster than any other \\"greatest hits\\" package that BMG put out previously).  The sound on this song alone is worth the price of the CD.  Some fans are not happy with the choice of songs, but the title is 30 # 1 hits. I like the song \\"That's someone you'll never forget\\", but it is not included. Why? It didn't get to the # 1 spot. Others are disappointed by BMG's use of 2 \\"alternate\\" takes and the exclusion of \\"I want you, I need you, I love you\\" (a song that DID make it to # 1 in the USA). The reason given for using the alternate takes is because the master tapes were (in contrast to the other masters) in such disrepair that the alt. takes were used for a better sound. Justified?  I'm not sure. \\"The wonder of you\\" on this CD is NOT a better version on this disc as the one that has been released on several other Presley CD's - \\"A fool such as I\\" sounds great - but it lacks the excitement that the released version captured.  However, it is a small sacrifice for the magnificence of the other tracks.  All of Elvis # 1's could not be included on a single CD.  He had many other chart toppers in countries outside the USA and England.  The powers that be at BMG decided to use the charts in the US and England only . . . many others are missing beside \\"I want you, I need you, I love you\\".  <br />I have an extensive collection of Elvis Presley CD's from almost every country in the world.  The criticism of BMG for putting out an endless stream of mediocre Presley product IS justified.  Since the advent of the CD - BMG had treated the Presley catalog as irrelevant, simply a \\"money maker\\".  When you can release a CD with 9 songs clocking in at a total of 23 minutes and still sell a few hundred thousand copies, with no promotion - why go through the expense of extensive liner notes and the re-mastering of the tapes?   Only since the later part of the 90's has BMG taken a serious look at the impact their previous marketing plan had on Elvis' image (not to mention their own dwindling pocketbooks!)  The people in charge of the Presley catalog now, are not only business men and women, but they are fans intent in \\"fixing\\" the wrongs done in the previous decade.  If this release is an indication of the care and promotion they will give Elvis' CD's in the future, I'm sure everyone will be happy and get the songs they want sooner or later.  <br />Like Elvis or not - his impact on music is undeniable. This is a 5 star CD - no doubt about it. If you are a new fan - your next step into the world of Elvis is \\"The Complete Sun Sessions\\".  If you are an \\"old\\" fan like me . . . let's press BMG to re-master EVERY Elvis release from now on.  See what a few commercials and a bit of promotion will do for you BMG??  \\"Elv1s # 1's\\" has now sold close to 8 million units all over the world and has gone to # 1 in 28 countries (or territories).  Not bad for a country boy that never wrote his own songs or music and couldn't play an instrument and went to Vegas to \\"sell out\\".  Perhaps with more releases like this one, people will finally understand that the previous statements are not true and Elvis Presley is THE most important musical influence of the 20th century.
B00006JIAF|1.0|I feel cheated by this release.  I know that The Strokes are trying to circumvent this by releasing another DVD later this year, but I feel a certain sense of entitlement for having found The Strokes' music sooner, rather than later.  I first bought the album on Ebay when the ship date was pushed back, and then I even bought the US copy for When It Started (terrible compared to NYC Cops).  I don't want to have to spend more money on a product other people get for &quot;falling in,&quot; so to speak.  I will still buy the DVD when it comes out...I really like The Strokes, but I don't condone this sneaky tack that they have taken up.
B000050FEN|5.0|Se7en is ultimately the antithesis of what a Hollywood movie should be. When it came out, there was so much controversy about the film's brutal nature and horrifying ending. People in theaters walked out angry and disgusted. But maybe that's what makes it so brilliant. The fact that it makes you feel almost as wrought with emotion as Brad Pitt's character in the end is what makes it such a powerful film. The story revolves around two detectives: A bitter, seasoned veteran named Somerset (played by the wonderful Morgan Freeman) on the verge of retirement, and his replacement in training, the cocky Mills (played by Brad Pitt). Both are investigating a series of murders that appear to be based on the seven deadly sins (Greed, Envy, Pride, Wrath, Sloth, Gluttony and Lust) that are being committed by an anonymous &quot;John Doe&quot; (Later revealed as Kevin Spacey). No fingerprints can be found and virtually no clues are given. Both cops are consistently getting stressed out as the movie progresses, and the first two thirds of the movie focus on their relationship. Things, however, get really nasty in the final half hour, when John Doe unexpectedly turns himself in, and refuses to confess unless Somerset and Mills escort him to the site of his final two murders. I will not ruin the ending for you. Although, one might be able to predict to a certain degree what will happen after hearing a certain revealing conversation between Mills' wife and Somerset (However, what I predicted was actually more brutal than what happened, and probably couldn't be printed in these pages). This movie is basically David Fincher's break-through film. After critical shame with his contribution to the Alien series, Alien3, he redeemed himself with this masterpiece. The world Fincher creates in this movie is completely composed of filth. It is drenched in darkness and rains, and nobody ever seems to smile. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt do extremelely good jobs, but Gwenyth Paltrow's role as Mills' wife seems too under-developed. But I must say, if I had a hat on right now, it would go off to Kevin Spacey, who plays John Doe perfectly. His character is both cold and intelligent and Spacey does a fantastic job with such little screen-time. The DVD is, also, very excellent. There are four different commentary tracks, deleted scenes, two alternate endings and even a little feature on John Doe's notebooks. You really get the bulk for your buck on this one. I urge any movie fan who takes him/herself seriously to check this movie out. It is probably one of the top five movies on my favorites list.<br />&quot;He's experienced about as much pain and suffering as anyone I've encountered and he still has Hell to look forward to.&quot;s' wife seems too under-developed.

6302968143|5.0|Hocus Pocus is entertaining, funny, scary, and sweet. It's about how 3 witch sisters are brought back to life and their quest to stay alive for an eternity using a spell, a potion, and a child.  It's also about the relationship between a brother and his younger sister; mix in a new girlfriend, and a wonderful black cat named Binks, who teaches them all how to fight the evil witches and their black magic. In the end, good wins over evil and even Binks is freed of the curse that the witches had placed on him 300 years earlier.  I never miss watching this movie every year at Halloween, and even the younger kids can watch because it's such a happy ending!
B00005QZ7U|4.0|Moulin Rouge is Baz Luhrmann's vision-it is raunchy, vibrant, explosive, tragic but most of all it embraces the four main principles of bohemian life--truth, beauty, freedom and love.  This movie is just bursting off of the screen with colors, sound and visual ecstacy.<br />I love not only the visuals, but also the story in itself.  As tragic as it is starcrossed, it's just a fanstastic movie, overall.  Highly recommended!
B000002MP2|5.0|If you are unfamiliar with Greenday (something nobody should be) they are pop rockers with a slight punch of punk. Any rock fan will agree with me when I say this album is essential to any music collection. Every track is rock at it's finest. You would mistake this for a greatest hits album if you didn't know better because the entire album is a mix of feel-good pure sensation, whether you're listening to WELCOME TO PARADISE, BURNOUT, LONGVIEW, etc. This truly is the definition of rock n' roll.
0316666343|4.0|Sebold gripped this reader's attention from the first word -- none of this taking a few chapters to \\"get into\\" this book.  Heart-wrenching and heartwarming simultaneously, I didn't want to put it down!  Hope to see many more works from this gifted, in-touch author!!!
B000003TA4|5.0|If you don't own this CD you don't know what you're missing. This is, to be concise, the greatest album I have ever heard.  Time after time modern bands try to copy the style and revolutionary sound of Nirvana's best cd but not yet have they come close to something like it. Every song is worth listening to; from the track you're most likely to recognize, SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT, to the most essential song on the record, LITHIUM. Never has anything come close to this work of art. As real as it is good, this is the album to buy, even more than 10 years after its  release.
0446608955|5.0|This is, by far, the most beautiful book I have ever read.  So beautiful, in fact, that I absolutely refuse to see the movie.  It's that perfect in my mind.  I don't want to mess with the images I have of the characters and the town.  It's that eloquently written.  An interesting thing about the book is it's up to you how the story ends; the author leaves it for you to determine.  Either way you think the story ends, your only regret will be having to close the book and leave the world of Landon and Jamie behind...
B000002UAR|5.0|Without question in my mind, the Beatles are the greatest ever and this is, without question in my mind, their best album and the best album ever. The band that defines &quot;music&quot; was on a roll when they released this one. Nobody can truly call themselves a rock n' roll fan without owning this. Words can't describe the incredible work of are this is. To listen to this album is to appreciate the Beatles and the world, so buy it.
B00006HBUA|5.0|Scooby-Doo, the live-action movie, opens with the original gang solving one of their typical mysteries, the case of the Luna Ghost. Daphne has been kidnapped, Velma has a plan, Fred is giving orders, and Scooby and Shaggy are playing the fall guys. It's all very familiar, and hilarious to see in live-action, with all the physical gags of the cartoon! But when the case is solved and Fred takes the credit again, everyone (except Scooby and Shaggy) realizes how totally tired they are of the parts they play in Mysteries, Inc. Velma is tired of not getting any credit or attention, Daphne is tired of being the damsel in distress, and Fred is looking to expand his horizons on his favorite subject, himself. So, despite Scooby and Shaggy's protests, the group finally splits up after all these years.<br /> One year later, the gang finds themselves bumping into each other at an airport on their way to an amusement park resort called Spooky Island. It seems they've all been invited by the owner, Mr. Mondavarious, to investigate the strange behavior of the college kids who visit and work there. At first, Velma, Freddie, and Daphne are frustrated about running into their old friends, each one determined to solve this mystery on their own, but in time those old feelings of friendship return as they work together as a team to do what they do best. And Shaggy and Scooby couldn't be happier at the reunion, though Shaggy's attentions are divided as he channels most of his energy into wooing a young lady named Mary Jane. Together, the gang overcomes many obstacles to discover the truth behind the strange goings on at Spooky Island, and what they discover in the end is something few would ever have suspected!<br /> Scooby-Doo is a great movie! I've watched Scooby cartoons all my life, and found this movie to be tons of fun! But it's not for everyone! There are those certain Scooby fans who can't stand it when the supernatural events in a Scooby story turn out to be real instead of just a man in a mask. Well, if you're that type, you may not like this film, but then, maybe you will. See, in this movie the Mystery involves both the Supernatural, AND the villain in a mask routine! Then, believe it or not, there are those out there who are loyal fans of Scrappy-Doo! Well, if you love Scrappy, you will probably hate this movie, as it involves a lot of extreme Scrappy bashing. Yes, he's in this movie, and yes, he plays a major role (though with minimum screen time), but Scrappy is depicted in a very negative light. This was done mostly because so many fans hate Scrappy, but as I said, some people do love him. As for me, I like him okay, loved him as a kid, but I can go both ways on the subject now, and I can easily take a little Scrappy bashing so it didn't bother me. Now, the sets in this film are amazing! Very spooky and funny at the same time! As for the casting; perfect Shaggy, great (though much more attractive than the cartoon) Velma, gorgeous as always Sarah Michelle Gellar makes a perfect Daphne, and her new hubby (grrrr) Freddie Prince, Jr. does a sufficient job with Fred, a character that was never that great to begin with. I probably wouldn't have cast Freddie P. as Fred, since the voice isn't right and he doesn't look that much like him either, but he doesn't hurt the film at all. It's not like Rosie O'Donnel trying to convince us she's Betty Rubble, ruining what otherwise was a great Flintstone movie (oh, and the kids were too old in that one, but that's a whole other review). As for the CGI Scooby and Scrappy-Doo, well, they're obviously CGI, but they're still pretty good once you adjust your eyes and your mind to ignore that aspect. They just needed some better light and shadow work in a lot of their scenes. A lot of fans didn't like the look Scooby had, but I thought it was a great interpretation of Scooby as a \\"real\\" dog. I mean, that's a tricky thing to have to do. Overall, this is a FUN movie, that's the key word. Even my dad sat andan in a mask. Well, if you're that type, you may not like this film, but then, maybe you will. See, in this movie the Mystery involves both the Supernatural, AND the villain in a mask routine!

Of course, some people will just watch to see Sarah Michelle Gellar I suppose. I should also point out that Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) plays Mr. Mondavarious, and gives one of his usual hilarious performances! The DVD is great by the way, with some nice behind the scenes stuff, and a great CAST commentary! Definitely a must own for fans of Scooby-Doo or cartoon movies in general (By the way, if you like this one be sure to get the Josie and the Pussycats live-action movie)! The deleted scenes on the Scooby-Doo DVD are really great, and most, if not all of them, would have been great to see in the actual film! Especially the wonderful animated opening! They truly should have left that one in! As for the sequels that were talked about so much on the commentary, I'm looking forward to them, but I better see Scooby-Dum in one of them, and please, no Scooby-Dum bashing! I love that guy! Dum dum dum duuummmmmm!
B000002GW5|5.0|There are some albums in your collection that have an amazing ability to create a mood or energy....they are timeless and when you go back to them you are always rewarded with a sound that can sweep you away !!  Running on Empty is one of those albums.  I like this one more for the songs that no one ever heard on the radio....songs like &quot;The Road&quot; which features some of the best acoustic guitar ever recorded, is an amazing snapshot of life on the road as a musician.  Jackson is able to create vivid pictures of what its like....his images of the positives of being a big time rock star are juxtaposed well with the mind numbing time spent in between shows....and best of all the song is memorable and you can sing along with him as he goes thru it all !!  Another classic is &quot;Rosie&quot; a song created from a sound technicians/roadie's perspective....you can't help feel the feelings of rejection this poor guy goes thru....he get's this girl great seats to a concert only to lose her to the drummer....but again the sadness is tempered with a little humor....&quot;Rosie you're all right....you wear MY ring&quot;...great stuff !!  <br />&quot;Cocaine&quot; is a classic blues riff that captures a time in the American culture when the white stuff ruined many a musician...this is not the glorified &quot;Cocaine&quot; of Clapton...but a somber blues perspective of the highs and true lows of this little white powder.<br />And last but certainly not least....&quot;The Load Out&quot; which blends nicely into a memorialized version of &quot;Stay&quot; again offers vivid imagery of life on the road.  Here the piano is the focal instrument and the &quot;live&quot; element here offers something magical you can't capture in the &quot;retake&quot; environment of a studio.....this is the best this song has ever sounded and they miraculously and fortuitiously caught it on tape.....the chord progressions bang into your soul and give you chills !! <br />This album can be pickedup for very little cash...pick it up....put on some candles and listen to it with someone special...it is pure music magic !!  Thank you Jackson Browne !!
0792164903|5.0|Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow is in no way a simple live-action interpretation of the Disney version of Washington Irving's classic Halloween tale, but if you are a fan of that second half of Disney`s the Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad, you will definitely notice the similarities! There's no doubt that Christina Ricci's Katrina Van Tassel is nearly every bit as delicious looking as the Disney version, and so many of the visuals, such as the covered bridge scenes, will take you right back to that classic cartoon. You'll even hear the frogs croaking Ichabod's name as he rides across the bridge on his worn out old plow horse. But there are many differences in this new, moody version of the tale too. <BR>      This time, Ichabod Crane comes to us not as a school teacher, but as a police detective from New York at the end of the 18th century, sent to Sleepy Hollow to investigate the recent rash of grisly murders taking place there. His only clues are a graveyard of headless bodies and a story circulating throughout the village about a headless horseman come back from the grave for revenge. The horseman was a Hessian mercenary from the Revolutionary War, with teeth filed to points and a lust for blood, whose head was cut off upon his capture. The very hearing of the tale sends a chill through Ichabod, an easily frightened man who hides behind a mask of skepticism. Acquiring lodging with the prominent Van Tassel family, Ichabod takes on a young assistant named Masbath, a boy orphaned by the horseman. With the help of Young Masbath and Katrina Van Tassel, the Van Tassel's beautiful daughter, Ichabod attempts to discover the source of the trouble in Sleepy Hollow. But in this strange little village, everyone makes a good suspect. <BR>     Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow plays very much like a spooky, supernatural version of Sherlock Holmes. In fact, an entire franchise of Scooby-Doo type mystery movies could have been built on this film, with sequel after sequel of Crane, Masbath, and Katrina solving mystery after mystery. I would have seen them all anyway! But what we have here is one great new rendition of the classic tale, with all the atmosphere and mood one expects from Tim Burton. I'd have to label this as Burton's best work yet, possibly the best he'll ever do, as it will be very hard to top. The casting in this film is excellent by the way! Johnny Depp is a surprisingly good Ichabod, Christina Ricci is perfect as Katrina, Casper Van Dien is an equally excellent choice as Brom, Marc Pickering was very likeable as Young Masbath, and the film is full of other wonderful actors such as Christopher Lee, Martin Landau, Jeffrey Jones, and none other than Christopher Walken as the headless horseman! The DVD is wonderful too, with interviews, commentary, behind the scenes, and other goodies. There's a fair share of violence and even some gore, probably too much for little kids, but overall this is not really a scary film, just a really great, creepy, beautiful supernatural action/mystery for the Halloween season, or anytime you're in a Halloween mood! A must own for lovers of great films and visual masterpieces!
B00006JL1Z|5.0|So we have a new compilation from Fleetwood Mac entitled The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac. It is the best one yet, being the most complete of the three (the others being 1988's Greatest Hits, and 1992's The Chain Box Set). Almost all of the singles are here and many key album tracks that fans quibbled about not being on the other compilations are present.<BR>     Disc one is excellent, but if I had put the tracks together, I would have done it a bit differently. Live versions of \\"Rhiannon\\" and \\"I'm So Afraid\\" (particularly the 1980 version from Fleetwood Mac Live) should have been put on, but instead we get a remix of \\"Rhiannon\\" and the live version of \\"I'm So Afraid\\" from 1997's The Dance, which are both excellent; but I prefer those other versions. The extended version of \\"Love in Store\\" should have been put on, too. \\"Storms\\", a great song from Tusk, should have been replaced by a better Stevie song, \\"Angel.\\" It is great that the producers put the live version of \\"Big Love\\" here. Another plus is that the long version of \\"Sara\\" is here. And also worth mentioning is the remixed version of  \\"Over My Head\\" is included. And can't forget the STUDIO version of \\"Silver Springs\\" is present, sans the backing vocals from Lindsey and Crhristine as heard on The Chain Box Set.<BR>     Disc two, also excellent, is not as good as disc one, but is still great. It starts off with a one-two punch with \\"The Chain\\" and \\"Don't Stop.\\" Next up is one of my favorite songs from Lindsey, \\"What Makes You Think You're the One.\\" \\"Gypsy\\" is very deserving of being on this collection, but only in the extended version you can find on The Chain Box Set; instead we hear the edited version. \\"Second Hand News\\", another well-crafted song from Lindsey, is here in all its bluegrass glory. I think \\"Go Insane\\" (a Lindsey Buckingham solo hit, which is the live version from The Dance here) should have been changed with \\"Not That Funny\\" or, more importantly, \\"I Know I'm Not Wrong\\"(his best song), both from theTusk album. \\"Think about Me\\" and \\"Sisters of the Moon\\" (awesome guitar licks) appear in the remixed singles versions. You also get \\"Little Lies\\" and the Stevie song from Rumours, \\"Gold Dust Woman.\\" My favorite Mac song of all time appears here, \\"Hold Me.\\" Though this song was one of their biggest hits and their biggest hit of the 80's, it is underrated. It is amazing how Lindsey and Christine play with each other's vocals. The chorus is catchy with some kind of crazy percussion instrument that Lindsey probably thought of using, and there is some great guitar in the instrumental section. And you can't forget that classic piano intro. The underrated Stevie song \\"Seven Wonders\\" is included too. I think \\"World Turning\\" could have been replaced with Christine's \\"Oh Daddy.\\" Many of you may be wondering why Lindsey's \\"Family Man\\" is on here, but I don't. It is one of his best songs. Before I found out the track listing for this collection I was hoping it would be on here. It's obvious people didn't give it a chance, hence it's #90 peak on the chart, but its silliness and eccentricity are what truly make the song shine. The drumbeats in the middle of the song are cool, and there is some exotic Spanish guitar in the song, played brilliantly. The end of disc two is where it falters. \\"As Long As You Follow\\" is a nice song but could have been changed with \\"Eyes of the World.\\" And why is \\"No Questions Asked\\" on here? It's not that great of a song, and we really didn't need both new songs from Greatest Hits on here. I guess they put them here because they had to include some songs from the Vito-Burnette era of Fleetwood Mac, and those two songs would be some of their best right? (there aren't very many). Stevie's \\"Paper Doll\\" and Christine's \\"Skies the Limit\\" are excellent numbers that outshine the other two Vito-Burnette songs from Greatest Hits, BUT \\"Skies the Limit\\" could have been changed with a better Christine song from Behind the Mask, \\"Save Me.\\" \\"The Ledge\\", \\"Honey Hi\\" (Christine's best from Tusk), \\"Can't Go Back\\", and \\"Book of Love\\" (love the nostalgic feel) should have been put on the collection as well (YES, I KNOW ABOUT TIME LIMITS!!)<BR>     The cd booklet has a commentary from Sheryl Crow. There are some pictures of the group and solo shots inside, as well as peak positions of singles and albums on the charts.<BR>     The enhancements are a nice addition. Included are a documentary of the making of the upcoming album, the \\"Seven Wonders\\" video, live performances of \\"The Chain\\" and \\"Go Your Own Way\\" from the Mirage tour, and a performance of \\"Rhiannon\\" from the Rosebud documentary.<BR>     With all of my (at times petty) complaints you may wonder why I gave this five stars. Well, it deserves it. This is still a thoroughly enjoyable collection (though some better songs could be included) from possibly the best band of all time. Even the worst Mac songs are a level above most artists' best work. If you are a die hard fan of this band then you may want to pass this collection up, because I'm sure you have these songs in your Mac collection anyway, but if you must have everything Fleetwood Mac does, buy it. If you are becoming acquainted with the band, then by all means pick this up. You will thoroughly enjoy it (or almost thoroughly because I realize not everyone will like all 36 songs, but I find that hard to believe). Anyway, this is the best the Mac has to offer (right behind Rumours and Tusk (the group's best album). <BR>     Thanks for reading this LONG review, and don't forget to pick up the NEW ALBUM (minus Christine McVie) in EARLY SPRING 2003! Later!
0316666343|3.0|Slightly interesting. Not a fast past novel. Defintely a chick book.
0316666343|5.0|I really connected with this book. I enjoyed every minute I spent between those pages and never wanted it to end. It was thoughful and provocative. The characters were so well written and detailed I knew them all. I work in criminal psychology and this book did a good job of dealing with the criminal mind, without distracting from the real point of the book. It really was a fantastic book and a most excellent read. Bravo, Ms. Sebold!
0782008372|3.0|This is a good action scifi.  Lots of action and the story has a good flow.  However, the picture quality is poor.  I expect better from a DVD.
B00004YRQA|5.0|As with a lot of game consoles when you first buy it(besides the old Genesis, SNES etc) there isn't a memory card packaged with it. Now the price of it in Canada [...] may seem lots for such a little thing but if you have a PS2, sooner or later you're gonna need this. You can't use your PS1 memory card as the files are quite big and obviously it just wouldn't work. Doesn't matter what you play, you're gonna need this. Sports games to save your game stats and if you do tournament-like things, RPG's obviously so you can not play the 20-40 hour games in one shot and so on. So if you're planning on getting a PS2 or have one but don't have this, you might as well buy this and not the 3rd party kind.
B00003CXDZ|1.0|Oh..my...[word]..<br />They blaspheme! Elton John's 'Your Song' smudged in the dirt. Bowie's 'Heroes' ground into dust. Nirvana mixed with 'Lady Marmalade', Marilyn Monroe mixed with Madonna,,,<br />...<br />Marq
B00005V9HA|5.0|What can be said of \\"Re-Animator\\" that hasn't been said before?  As horror movies go, it is a true classic, and a landmark in innovative effects even with budget restraints.  So, before I delve into the film itself, let me first start with the DVD:<br />This is not the first edition of this movie availible for purchase from Elite Entertainment.  However, it is vastly superior to their previous version, which was, in itself, a triumph.  \\"Re-Animator\\" has been labeled as a \\"Millenium Edition\\" from Elite, which, for DVD fans, is very good news indeed.  Although Elite possesses (no pun intended) a fairly small library of titles, the releases from the studio have been impressive enough to rival even the cult-movie megapower that has become Anchor Bay.  Elite has brought the world the finest version of George A. Romero's \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" to ever hit shelves, as well as a version of \\"The Evil Dead\\" that, had it not been for the release of the \\"Book of the Dead\\" earlier last year, may have (and some would claim still is) just been THE definitive version of that movie.  Yet if these releases are just the icing on the cake (which they are), then \\"Re-Animator\\" is the candle on top.<br />Boasting FOUR audio setups (including DTS 5.1 surround) and not one, but TWO commentaries(the second of which is highly entertaining and informative), as well as THX digital transfer, this movie could easily stand on it's own.  But that just wouldn't have been good enough, would it?  No, not for a \\"Millenium\\" release...<br />So a second disk is included, and it holds some of the most interesting and informative supplements that I've ever seen.  While I won't get into too much detail, let me just say that the extended and deleted scenes alone are worth the cost of the DVD.  But there is sooooooo much more, most notably, an interview with Stuart Gordon, three multi-angle story boards, and some hilarious TV spots.  And I've only mentioned less than a fourth of all this disk has to offer!<br />Now that I've clarified just how credible the DVD is, let me briefly discuss the movie.  The plot concerns a struggling medical student and his desire to create a serum that can ressurect dead tissue.  His misadventures get him in a heap of trouble that eventually leads up to a violent finale where the dead are \\"re-animated\\" and wage a war against the living in a hospital morgue.  This movie is not for all tastes.  It is filled with over-the-top gore and gratuitous sexuality,  you've most likely never heard of the majority of the actors, the movie was made on an obviously limited budget, and it was Brian Yuzna's directorial debut.  Now, replace some of the words I just said and you have the synopsis for just about every 80's B-horror movie ever made.  But where these movies failed, \\"Re-Animator\\" succeeds by having an extremely dedicated team of people devoted to the movie's well-bieng, a fantastic script by Dennis Paoli, and a sense of style that was lacking in so many films before the birth of \\"Re-Animator\\" and after it's eventual sucession into cult movie history.  This is horror cinema at it's best.<br />A great movie and a fantastic DVD? What more could one want? Highly recommended.
B000058983|2.0|This album sounds like generic 60s oldies that you hear every time you go to the dentist or when your aunt is driving.<br /><br />The first two songs are good... but only good when compared to the rest of the album or the utter garbage of the period.  Way back in '67, there was good music.  There was great music... Beefheart, Hendrix, Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac, the Beatles and Stones, the Doors, the 13th Floor Elevators, Scott Walker and the Walker Brothers, and the flippin' Velvet Underground.  Syd Barrett was helming Pink Floyd at their best, Can were forming, Van Morrison was coming into his own, and Magic Sam was working it out.  All in all, a very fertile period.  Do not waste your time or money on this album.  There's plenty of good stuff out there for you.
B00006IUL7|5.0|We have seen Academy Award winner Robin Williams (Best Supporting Actor, 1997: \\"Good Will Hunting\\") in lots of hilarious films such as \\"Mrs. Doubtfire\\", \\"Good Morning, Vietnam\\", \\"Bicentennial Man\\", and \\"Death to Smoochy\\". We have also seen him in a memorable few dramatic roles such as \\"Dead Poets Society\\", \\"Good Will Hunting\\", \\"What Dreams May Come\\", and \\"Jakob the Liar\\". But now, Williams really outdoes himself when he takes on the role of...ruthless killer! The movie is called \\"Insomnia\\", a film with so much intensity and suspense that you would have to see it again and again! The direction of Christopher Nolan (\\"Memento\\") is brilliant in every way possible! Williams is also paired up with fellow Academy Award winners Hilary Swank (Best Actress, 1999: \\"Boys Don't Cry\\") and the legendary Al Pacino (Best Actor, 1992: \\"Scent of a Woman\\") into bringing this thriller of Hitchcockian proportions to the big screen! \\"Insomnia\\" focuses on a seasoned veteran LAPD detective named Will Dormer (Pacino), who is invited to Nightmute, Alaska with his partner, Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan), to head a murder case. Dormer teams up with an inexperienced, young detective named Ellie Burr (Swank) in order to find out who caused the murder and why. But during the case, Dormer finds himself and his investigation disrupted by an ever-shining midnight sun that wreaks sleep-depriving havoc on him. In other words, Dormer has inside of him what we call a \\"body clock\\". It could go off at any moment, on any day, and at any time as well. The case has also disrupted Dormer by personal guilt over a second crime that may be real...or a figment of his increasingly unstable conciousness. During the movie, the prime suspect in the murder case is a best-selling author named Walter Finch (Williams). And to me, it seems as though Dormer may have met his match when Finch starts playing these sadistic mind games with Dormer which will eventually lead to a shocking finale between the two foes! I have the DVDversion of \\"Insomnia\\", loaded with extras such as an additional scene, scene-specific commentaries with Hilary Swank and crew, featurettes, theatrical trailer, stills gallery, and DVD-ROM features. In conclusion, I just have to say that \\"Insomnia\\" is truly one of the sharpest thrillers that I've seen since Nolan's \\"Memento\\" or any other thriller. With three of the greatest acting talents today, a fine supporting cast (Maura Tierney, Nicky Katt, Paul Dooley), and an incredible storyline that will keep you guessing until the very end, \\"Insomnia\\" is a must-see for everyone and a DVD must-own if you are an avid Robin Williams fan or an avid Al Pacino fan!
B000005H40|1.0|John Coltrane along with Miles Davis and the rest of them ruined jazz.  They're just so random.  I mean, come on, 5 year olds could play this music.<br />Jazz was headed in the right direction with Glenn Miller and the rest of those brilliant, gifted pop-jazz musicians.  Jazz then went spiraling into the ...for 40 years, until Kenny G came along with his perfect, soul-filled solos and such.  Oh, he's just heavenly.<br />So, as you can see, I have really poor taste and you should want to disassociate yourself from me and buy this album.
B00005OWEG|5.0|The added 49 minutes of footage to Apocalypse Now helps to develope the characters more and give a better feeling to the movie. The movie is now less direct but explores the themes of insanity further.<br />The earlier added scene showing the soldiers stealing Kilgores surfboard shows Willard joking with the crew, and shows how normal they are at this point and how together. this makes the crews descendance into insanity more remarkable later on and more pronounced.<br />The French plantation sequence helps show the effects of war from a different viewpoint, and breaks away from the action for a while. It also shows a more caring side to Willard and makes his character more real.<br />Although the movie is now less of a straight action movie, that was never what it was about anyway. You could argue it is pretentious but it looks at the philosophy of war much more effectively than most all action Vietnam movies, and the extended scenes with Brando at the end really help to explain the film better.<br />In all, Apocalypse Now redux makes a movie which almost fits, work perfectly. Definately the best Vietnam movie ever made, and worth buying even if you have the original.
B00005JKLZ|3.0|The movie was good. Unless, of course, you've read the book...I've a tendency to nitpick books-turned-films, but with The Time Machine, I couldn't. By the time he got to the Eloi and the Morlocks, while I was delighted by the graphics and the beautiful scenery, I'd been shocked into silence by how far it goes from the book. <br />I'm not the best for writing reveiws, so I'll just say this; it's a good enough movie on its own terms, but don't watch the modern Time Machine if you can't stand it being almost nothing like the book.
B00005OM4N|4.0|The title of the Cd fits perfectly, because, well, this is all Britney. Some of the beats in the songs are similar yet, I liked \\"Overprotected\\" and \\"Cinderella\\". It's about time she grew up. The attempt to reinvent herself did not fly well with critics and/or fans. Though bubblegum pop is fading, this record is definitely apart of that fade.
B00005R87Q|1.0|This flat movie is a non-officially admitted remake of Kathryn Bigelow's \\"Point Break\\", with Diesel and Walker (both very bad actors - a rare see in movies) replacing Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves. The complex relationship between the gangster and the undercover cop, which existed in \\"Point Break\\" has been erased here: everything is just made for showing cars rolling as fast as possible, and many hot girls (Jordana Brewster is OK...), as beautiful as brainless, all walking around in slight clothes, only there for the decoration. Of course the result has not a single slice of interest. \\"Point Break\\" was not a masterpiece already, so taking its whole plot and putting it in the racing circle is not very expectable of hope of quality. The dialog is silly, the sound and music are deafening (on purpose, only in order to keep us down on our seats) and the ending is totally ridiculous and unsatisfying - despite all the dangers and insane stunt scenes, nobody dies or gets seriously hurt (except the one who's shot by the truck driver) and the gangster drives away, with the cop as an accomplice. Total nonsense! Fun (maybe) but dumb, and no good. And dangerous - keep the kids away from this! <br />For 'grown-downs' only, and they're plenty of them, especially in America - the film was a great success...
B000002NJS|3.0|Madonna said, &quot;I love Techno music, but you never really think of it as emotional, I wanted to make it emotional.&quot; In many of the songs, especially &quot;Little Star&quot; and &quot;Sky Fits Heaven&quot;, it was as if she was speaking from her heart and soul, not groin. My favorite songs were &quot;Little Star&quot;, &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, &quot;Candy Perfume Girl&quot; and &quot;The Power of Goodbye&quot;. Unlike many of her pop counterparts, only Madonna can reinvent herself so well.
B000003BQW|1.0|Generic Ramones album. Nothing remotely different or inspiring about it. Any wonder there are only 3 reviews?? Own 1 Ramomes album and you pretty much own them all.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|Well, with the return of Adrian Smith and Bruce Dickinson to the band, in addition to Janick Gers, Iron Maiden now consists of 6 members, 3 guitarists. This is finally the return of Iron Maiden, the band that struck gold back in 1982, and clearly you can see why while listening to this masterpiece. Bruce and Adrian bring back what was lacking during the last decade. The magic has returned with this album, and with a breathe of fresh air. It's a very diverse and progressive album, which I believe to rival the very best like \\"Somewhere in Time\\" and \\"seventh son\\". The album begins with \\"The Wickerman\\", which was released as a single. It's a fast and catchy song, a classic Maiden opener. Great anthem style ending, clearly meant for live performances. The next song begins slowly, and quickly delves into the madness which is the \\"Ghost of the Navigator\\". A very long and moody song, which gets you into the album, and into the mood that you'll feel throughout your listen. The next song, the title track is now one of my favorite Maiden songs ever, and clearly the best off this album. It starts off slow and melodic, and the three guitar parts work so well that it's almost unreal. Perfection!!! It slowly quickens up the pace, while adding more guitar parts, etc., and then finally you get to the big open chorus, and you're sold. This is when I decided that it was official. Maiden was back. Then you get to the lead breaks. Dave Murray delivers one of his finest solo's ever. Great song. \\"Blood Brothers\\" is next, and is one of the finer products of Steve Harris' creative talents. Great lyrics and melodies, and Bruce delivers them perfectly. Also another long song. The Mercenary is a quick song, a little monotonous with the chorus, but it sounds cool, so it's not a bad thing. The song gets my vote from the lead breaks alone. Great back to back solo's from Murray and Smith. Now we've reached the middle of the album, and the longest song off the album. Very progressive, and almost sureal. With \\"Dream of Mirros\\" The music works great with the lyrics. Great powerful chorus. The next two songs bring up the rear from this collection IMO, but in no way are bad songs. \\"Fallen Angel\\" is a quick catchy song written mostly by Adrian Smith, and \\"The Nomad\\" is another long epic song, where Harris tried to deliver a desert like arabic type feel. The middle of the song is very cool. \\"Out of the silent Planet\\" is next and again a very good song, the second single released. Great guitar riff at the beginning. The finale is fantastic. The best chorus ever. Great lyrics that make you want to shout out and sing along, and once you think the song is over, it resurges several times with cool solo's and finally dies down to it's end, the end of one of the best albums from this great band. Hail the return of Iron Maiden. Let's hope it doesn't end soon.
0792151712|5.0|The Titanic epic starts with two mini submarines on the ocean floor searching for a ghost ship that sunk 4/15/12. Once it's found, mini-camera's films: beautiful chandeliers, boots lying on the ship's floor, a pair of eye glasses, and a doll is found among other items. Eventually a treasure chest is found which leads to a 101 year old woman, who tells an interesting story. <BR>Gloria Stuart (Rose DeWitt), was aboard the Titanic 84 years ago.  Rose, a rich and beautiful woman, falls in love with Leonardo DiCaprio (Jack Dawson), a poor but attractive yound man.  James Cameron (director), does a subperb job of plotting this amazing love story, no wonder the Titanic won 11 Academy Awards.  Titanic cost $200 million to make but it grossed over $1 billion.<BR>The love story includes the mystery of a blue diamond, 56 carat, heart shaped necklace, worth more than the \\"Hope Diamond\\".  Rose had the necklace which was called \\"The Heart of the Ocean\\".  What happened to it?  You must watch Titanic to find out.<BR>I rate this film a 5.  James Cameron built an exact replica of the original Titanic using all the exquist iron laced work, priceless artwork, exact costumes of the 1912 era, and many other realistic details that helps to draw a person into the story making you feel as if you were on the Titanic at the time it hit the iceberg.
630204135X|5.0|This has been my favorite of all movies for a long time. To answer the Mudville fan, a lot is possible in this film and a symbolic murder of the actress Elizabet is very possible. A literal one, I don't think so. But who knows? <BR>The woman you see being filmed is Elizabet, presumably back working, though it's intersting the two people filming her are Persona's director and cinematographer, Bergman and Sven Nykvist. It's also interesting she's filmed upside down, just like the dead woman in the opening morgue sequence who suddenly opens her eyes.<...
B000006OS2|1.0|Everyone who has written about the poor transfer is correct. It's a disgrace. I watched three minutes of it, just past the opening credits, and gave up. Even the opening credits were blurry, and there were so many lines and streaks as to make it unwatchable. I'll be more careful in what I buy in the future. No more GoodTimes DVDs for me.Ugh!!!!!!!
6304698658|5.0|I bet your Christmas plans never quite work out right. The Griswalds' plans never work out either. Clark wants an old-fashioned family Christmas. Somewhere between Cousin Eddie showing up and the tree catching fire, everything goes wrong. The Griswalds are just as funny as they are in the other National Lampoon vacation movies (skip Vegas Vacation). The best character of all has to be Randy Quaid's 'Cousin Eddie'. He and Chevy Chase are at their best in this movie. This movie is hilarious from start to finish.<br />This is one of the funniest Christmas movies ever made; actually, it's probably one of the funniest movies ever made, period. I watch it at least once or twice a year, and so does everyone else in my family. Christmas isn't Christmas at my house if nobody quotes Clark or Eddie at least once. Everyone has at least one favorite line. If you're starting your collection of Christmas movies, make this one of your first buys.
B000069HKH|5.0|Right now, I am only 21 years old and have been a fan of Springsteen for only 3 of them.  I often wonder why people my age are often repulsed by Bruce but cling to his tired contemporaries like Aerosmith.  I believe the answer lies with Bruce's last full E Street Album, Born in the USA, and the lack of connection my generation has with those themes.<BR>Now, however, the boss is back with themes everyone can relate to.  With the 9/11 context, its very powerful.  However, without it, its more.  The title track is a testimonial to anyone who works hard at their job (the cross of my calling) and has sacrificed because of it.  \\"Mary's Place\\" is a seemingly happy song but melancholy undertones, which I think is absolutely brilliant.  \\"Into the Fire,\\" admittedly written for the fireman, speaks so loudly that the chorus (\\"May your strength give us strength/May you faith give us faith/may your hope give us hope/May your love bring us love\\") was evenused during the recent Major League Baseball playoffs during postgame celebrations on TV!  <BR>However, my personal favorite from the album is \\"Lonesome Day.\\" This song can be read in many different ways, and the ambiguity of this song and many others on the album are what makes it fantastic.  \\"Lonesome Day\\" can be about any tragedy that leaves you alone, whether it be death, rejection, betrayal, or disappearance.  Great song, and I look forward to the music video.<BR>If you've never given Bruce a chance, listen to this album.  \\"The Rising,\\" \\"Lonesome Day,\\" and \\"You're Missing\\" are good places to start.  I'll see you furthur on up the road.

B00001NFCY|5.0|A couple of years ago there was a very controversial, yet incredibly popular album released by an unknown band. The name of this album is &quot;Human Clay,&quot; the band is Creed.<BR>   <BR>   Not only did this CD thrust Creed into the spotlight faster than they were prepared to handle, but it marked the beginning of many peoples journey into the world of Rock and Roll. What Creed has done with this album is what many bands in the past have tried and failed to do: define their genre.  Creed has achieved with this CD the kind of popularity that associates a band's name with a style of music. What Michael Jackson did with Pop, Creed has done with Rock.<BR>   <BR>   The CD starts out with an attention-grabbing intro, appropriately titled &quot;Are You Ready?&quot; Well, I don't think anyone was ready for what was to follow. The first couple of songs are powerful, yet catchy, carrying us into the rest of the album. The flow of the songs are depressing, yet hopeful. Dark, yet full of joy. Scott Stapp's voice matches perfectly with the hard-hitting guitar work and well-timed beats of each song. Towards mid-point in the CD we are faced with some rather slow moving songs, but do not let that fool you, every one of them is perfectly placed and fits the mood just right. The conclusion of the CD is the only part I find a bit lacking, I believe more work could have gone in to wrapping up the otherwise wonderfully crafted album.<BR>   <BR>   Overall, this album is a masterpiece. If you haven't heard it, go pick it up and let Creed take you into a journey of the ups, downs, highs, and lows of life. 5 out of 5 stars.<br />-Trisk
B00004SCX6|2.0|This is Britney's 2nd of 3 CDs. In her debut, she was introducing pop, and in the third, she tried (unsuccessfully) to abandon it. This record sounds almost identical to \\"...BOMT\\", but not as good. I didn't like it. If there was one song I do like, it's \\"Stronger\\". Most of the songs on here sound like a mixture of her debut and \\"Britney\\" material. The dialogue at the end of \\"Don't Go Knockin' On My Door\\", \\"What U See (Is What U Get)\\" and ESPECIALLY the dialogue before \\"Dear Diary\\" was extremely annoying and could have done without...I mean, who talks like that? Not horrible, but could have been better. Even the pics weren't all that great...uggh!
B0000524CY|5.0|This is THE Scariest film. Watch it as a horror film and take it seriously! Turn off the lights and watch it by yourself when your in the need for the biggest scare of your life. This is awesome. I rented Salem's Lot and this. I watched Salem's Lot first and thought\\" dang this is the scariest movie I've seen, I guess this next one will be a le down.\\" ... was I wrong. This totally blew Salem's Lot away! The best horror film. Good acting, real people, great story, and excellent music make this gem a treat for any horror or movie fan. Superb!

B000068IEU|4.0|THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is certainly not the best thriller ever filmed, nor is it horror maven Wes Craven's best effort.  It is, however, Craven's first feature-length stab (pun intended) at the horror genre, and for that reason alone, it will be of interest to any horror fan.  Also, it is a groundbreaking piece, the first slasher-type flick to realistically and graphically depict stabbing, evisceration, and other such nasties.  It should be easy for any horror fan to spot the influences of THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT in later films such as HALLOWEEN, FRIDAY THE 13th, and Craven's own masterpiece(s), the SCREAM trilogy.<br />In spite of the palpable bargain-basement production values, and regardless of the fact that some of the acting is far from Oscar calibre--to be fair, some of the acting in this film IS excellent, and besides, not all Oscar-winning performances are necessarily Oscar calibre, either--this film is nonetheless quite engaging, often repulsive, and relentlessly frightening.  In fact, sometimes the cheapie quality works to advantage, evoking a gritty realism that makes the film seem more like a documentary than a work of fiction.<br />The new MGM DVD version of this movie is well worth the very reasonable price.  According to Wes Craven in the newly added optional-play intro, this is the first time since its original release that the film has been made available in the original, uncut (or as restored as much as possible) form.  And it comes with lots of cool extras, too, not the least of which are a couple of documentaries featuring interviews with most of the cast, some of the crew, and Wes Craven himself.<br />Be forewarned that THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is most certainly not every viewer's cup o' tea...not even every horror buff's.  The raw sense of realism, the inexorable graphic violence, and the ambiguous morality of even the film's protagonists create a psychological intensity that can be a bit hard to take.  Viewers who are weak of stomach or weak of mind may do well to heed the advice of the movie's trailer and repeat to themselves, \\"It's only a movie...it's only a movie...it's only a movie....\\"<br />NOTE: THE FOUR-STAR RATING IS FOR FANS OF THE GENRE.  Non-genre fans will probably get sick, throw up, and pass out while watching this film.or weak of mind may do well to heed the advice of the movie's trailer and repeat to themselves, \\"It's only a movie...it's only a movie...it's only a movie....\\"<br />NOTE: THE FOUR-STAR RATING IS FOR FANS OF THE GENRE.

0790729652|5.0|You have to hand it to Tim Burton. He once again made a classic. His unqiue look at the story of Batman has never been out done. The score is excellent and the climax is memorable. The acting is great. Michael Keaton surprised everyone with his dark and memorable potrayl as the dark knight has never been surpassed. Jack Nicholson can not be described by any word. His insane villianous acting burys all the later villians to come. Kim Bassinger rates second only to Michelle Pheifer as the best actress in the film series. As for the rest of the cast,the supporting actors and actresses are excellent even in their small roles. Billy Dee Williams and Jack Palance had limited screen time. But in the times they were seen and heard, they acted wonderfully. This film is surely a classic. The darkness, the sadness, and the great cast and crew make this film hard to miss. It surely is the best of all Batman films that have ever come. The new director of the Batman series destroyed the good name of Batman. If their is any justice, Joel Shucmacher will never be allowed to direct antoher Batman movie again. The greatness of this film make it impossible to miss. As advice, watch this film, the second one, and finish it off at the third one. The forth one is a waste of time and money!
0446677450|4.0|Robert T. Kiyosaki is a person who many may call the millionaire teacher.  If you have read the book, Rich Dad Poor Dad you will understand why.  Kiyosaki says &quot;The main reason people struggle financially is because they spent years in school but learned nothing about money.  The result is, people learn to work for money ... but never learn to have money work for them.&quot;  The last sentence in this quote is what Kiyosaki heavily influences in the book illustrated above because he believes that this is the first step in becoming rich.  I agree with Kiyosaki to a certain extent but education in my book is the first step in becoming rich because you have to be well educated in order to make such decisions.  Kiyosaki does not promise the reader solutions to their financial tribulations; however he provides the reader with ideas that will help him or her succeed.
0446677450|3.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad has its good points and bad points. Robert Kiyosaki has amazing insights pertaining to the world of money and if followed, you may become a wealthy man/woman.  Although he has a chapter to guide how one might put these &quot;philosophies&quot; into action, there is not adequate information on how to REALLY get started.  For the most part, these guide points of Mr. Kiyosaki's are for the people that already have a substancial amount of money.  It would be very hard to practice these techniques when you are already in a &quot;trap.&quot;  Also, it seems like Mr. Kiyosaki is trying to tell the reader that life is about money and he implies that one is not successful without money.  It seems as if the underlying message of this book is to &quot;live for money&quot; and I disagree.
B00006J3T4|5.0|Once again, Mark Knopfler has produced an album of pure genuius.  He writes and sings in the tradition of the wandering minstrel,weaving stories through his music that evoke vivid pictures of other places and other lives, that we could never imagine until he comes to sing them to us. A song about the men who went to work in Germany during the Thatcher era, when there was no work in Britain, another about a hill farmer going to town to buy razor wire and tools, telling his unfaithful wife not to feed the dog and \\"Don't wait up for me\\".  A haunting song about missing Northumberland.   And the arrangements, the music, the chords, that guitar playing...Mark Knopfler at his best!  I didn't think anything could top the creative genius he demonstrated in Sailing to Philadelphia, but The Ragpicker's Dream is as good if not better.  Mark Knopfler is, in my opinion, the best songwriter of the age.
B00006FXB6|5.0|It's interesting to me that many reviews are written based on one, or at the most two encounters with an album. Are reviewers so naive, or perhaps the word is pompous, to believe they can grasp something that took at least a year to create in under an hour? <br />The point is, this is a brilliantly complex album of pure RAWK! and should be treated as such. There are many instances in the course of the 14 songs contained where the seemingly standard Verse Chorus Verse structure and constant time signature of a typical rock song is altered, in subtle ways, to create a complex album full of suprises that make it more than rewarding after MANY revisits. The presence of master vocalist Mark Lanagan and the unmistakable insanity of guitarist Gene Ween add a lot of flavor. <br />Basically, this record keeps getting better every time I hear it. It is the perfect cure for the GARBAGE that mainstream radio and Mtv are forcefeeding their public.<br />God Save the QUEENS!!
B00006C79E|5.0|I heard through a grape vine that Finisterre was supposed to be brilliant.  I bought it first thing this morning, 10.22.02, and it was more than brilliant.  The album starts with the single Action, which has layers of composition and programming, with expectedly unexpected melodies that set the mode for the whole album.  Soft Like Me is reminiscent of So Tough's Calico, with spoken word and an ever so catchy hook.  Shower Scene is one of those Saint Etienne songs I dream about, with city beats and windy vocals that are incomparable.  Plus, electro-influenced songs like Amateur and B92 are modern, but in a classic Saint style.  Overall, this album is exciting, new, and perfect in every way.  It's like a Too Young to Die Singles updated, but hard to believe, this isn't a singles collection.
B00005YXZH|5.0|The only thing better than this album is Wilco's live set. I was a bit baffled by the crowd, however. They played almost 3 full sets and got the best reaction at the end when they were plugging through standard versions of their old standards (at one point Tweedy quit altogether and let the crowd sing 'Passenger Side'). <br />While Tweedy is undeniably one of the most talented \\"alt-country\\" (the very phrase makes me shiver with nausea) songwriters of his generation, he is not at all one dimensional. The new album very clearly recognizes several facets of music making that are foreign to your typical folky songster; namely the existence of Jazz and Classical music and, more importantly, the possibility of a deconstructionist and experimental approach to writing and recording. Yankee HOtel is packed with Folk-Pop tunes that have been butchered, stripped, hosed-down and then rebuilt. Sometimes they maintain their basic integrity, other times they only let out an echo of their original form, but the results are always fascinating and engaging.<br />Now, back to the live show: The only thing more engaging than the Foxtrot album is to see them present the results of this songbuilding process live. The most fascinating performances were of \\"Misunderstood\\" and \\"Sunken Treasure\\", the opening tracks of their double release Being There. The compositions they played at times travelled miles from the original recording, allowing the song's first form to be a landmark, something to take off from, or possibly, to return to. But having in mind a more basic song structure (like the ones on the album), the reconstructed versions were even more beautiful to hear than the efforts on Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (the live versions more closely adhered to their recorded form).  <br />So, the album is a landmark for rock music. It opens the door to a new approach to making music; one that is fluid and possessing endless possibilities. Truly refreshing. And to Tweedy and Gang, As far as the \\"new direction\\" goes, run in it.

B000001FQQ|4.0|After the change of pace of the early 80's (Unamsked and The Elder), the heavy sounds of 82-84 (Creatures, Lick It Up, Animalize), and the glam-type mid to late 80's releases (Asylum, Crazy Nights, and the two new tracks on Smashes Thrashes), Kiss once again pulled out a new sound.  These tracks are all pretty accessible, it's a bit surprising that they didn't do more singles as a lot of the material here is tailor made for hard rock radio.  Standout cuts are &quot;Hide Your Heart&quot;, &quot;Prisoner of Love&quot;, and the big hit &quot;Forever&quot;.  A good CD, but if you're just starting with Kiss, go to Love Gun and then Destroyer for a better idea of how Kiss became legendary.
B000002LIM|5.0|That's right folks, only Danny Elfman could create such a majestic music for a superhero. He catches the heroism of soundtracks of Korngold and Superman plus gothicism from Bernard Herrmann's music. And it actually overpasses Superman score!<BR>Spite the later scores from Eliott Goldenthal, only Elfman can put us in Batman mood.<br />The first track is the Batman's main theme, an impressive dark and heroic cue, mostly recognized as one of the best themes in cinema history.<BR>\\"Roof Fight\\" is quick action music for Batman's first appearance.<BR>\\"First Confrontation\\" is one of the best tracks using action music with majestic parts of Batman's theme as he makes his way at Axis Chemicals. The music goes tragic when Jack falls in the acid.<BR>\\"Kitchen, Surgery, Face-Off\\" is a cozy music for a romantic part that goes darker and darker til Joker is presented with his clown-like theme.<BR>\\"Flowers\\" is a calm yet tragic variation of the main theme.<BR>\\"Clown Attack\\" has its volume higher and higher til the orchestra explodes showing Joker. A little and excellent music.<BR>\\"Batman To The Rescue\\" is an action part as the Joker's men chase the hero.<BR>\\"Roasted Dude\\" is a more ambiental one for a creepy scene with Joker.<BR>\\"Photos/Beautiful Dreamer\\" has a calm beginning that goes darker plus a new music for Joker's loved one.<BR>\\"Descent Into Mytery\\" is one of the most applaused of the score, cause it shows the main theme bigger and bigger til a fantastic explosion as the Batmobile enters-<BR>\\"The Bat Cave\\" is an ambiental cue with great notes when Batman surprises Vicky.<BR>\\"The Joker's Poem\\" is lullaby-like music as Joker says farewell to Vicky. <BR>\\"Childhood Remembered\\" is certainly the most tragic cue using choirs to show a dark part of the past.<BR>\\"Love Theme\\" is an instrumental part of \\"Scandalous\\" by Prince (which doesn't appear in the CD)<BR>\\"Charge of the Batmobile\\" has a sensational beginning with a crescendo for Batman and an explosion for Axis destruction.<BR>\\"Attack of The Batwing\\" is another fantastic action cue, with Batman's variations as he attacks Joker's plans. We hear bells when Batwing is about to crash.<BR>\\"Up To The Cathedral\\" is another fantastic rehash of Batman's theme, this time very well syncopated as the hero climbs the stairs after the villain. NOTE: A curious resemblance with \\"The Tower\\" from VERTIGO.<BR>\\"Waltz To The Death\\" is the Joker's theme in a full rendition for an action scene.<BR>\\"The Final Confrontation\\" ends majesticly the fight with the fall's notes from track 3 are heard and Joker finds his end. <BR>\\"Finale\\" is a cozy reunion of the love's theme plus the Batman's theme again since he'll guard Gotham City forever.<BR>The Cd reaches its end with another fantastic \\"Batman Theme Reprise\\".<br />Overall, the CD is very good having almost every music from the mov, and the low price is nice. <BR>If you want to hear the best of Danny Elfman-GO GET IT!
0780020685|5.0|Seven Samurai is a perfect Japanese film. There can be no improvements on the script, acting, or directing, it all is perfect. The film is about a village who is robed of their crops at every new harvest by bandits. They are miserable, starving and poor. They come up with the idea to find samurai to protect them. <br />This film is told in mostly 3 great segments. The first is in town searching and finding Samurai that will help them. The second shows the Samurai teaching the village war tactics and making plans for the war. The third is the most amazing part and is the war itself. <br />This film has a lot in it. A love story, training, war action, sword fights, eastern philosophy, humor, psychology, and more is included masterfully during the film. This film was very influential in the Western world. The Magnificent Seven was based on this film. I recommend this very much, do not be afraid to watch this just because its in black and white, and subtitled. This is a major film in the history of the medium, and should be seen. The story is great, and has a lot of cool things for everyone. Only problem is some parts the film is a little grainy but does not have to much negative effect. 5 stars, check it out.
0399226907|4.0|The very Hungry Caterpillar was a funny book and a good book for children 8 and under to read. This bool was quick to read. It is about a caterpillar alive that is born looking for food. I think its funny because everything he runs into he eats. At one point he eats a hole [bunch] of food. He eats some cake and just a hole bunch of food. The hungry caterpillar likes fruit expicially. Then he eats some leafs and goes to bed. Then something really cool happens. I do recommend this book it is a good book and I enjoyed it.
0385501560|5.0|.. i'm not going to give you a history lesson on how i got about to reading all chuck palahniuk's books but i just wanted to say it started off with &quot;choke&quot;. yes, i was a little late to notice the genius, nonetheless chuck palahniuk is an amazing author who always keeps things moving and even has a message. any of his books are worth reading. this is a highly entertaining, very funny book with an interesting plot and not so predictable ending. definately worth buying..you'll probably want to read it again.
B000000HZZ|5.0|This was the first Japan album I bought.  I am a big fan of Gary Numan and other New Wave early 80s music, and Japan and David Sylvian kept coming up when I conversed with other fans.  I thought I'd give them a try, and I'm glad I did.  If I hadn't, I would never have experienced the sheer brilliance of this album. That's what it is--an experience.  From the awesome 7-minute title track to the upbeat, yet eerie &quot;Swing&quot; (I find myself whistling this track many times), through the haunting instrumentals like &quot;Experience of Swimming&quot; and &quot;Width of a Room&quot; to the quirky, jazzy &quot;Methods of Dance.&quot;  Then there is &quot;Nightporter,&quot; perhaps the best of them all.  It is a beautiful, slow track with piano and (synthesized?) strings.  The ending melody takes one to a higher level.  Some may criticize this album for having too many instrumentals, but they are part of the &quot;feel&quot; of this album.  You may not blast some of these tracks in your car or dance to them with the headsets on, but you may find yourself turning out the lights, relaxing in your favorite easy chair and allowing the music to take you away.  Lumped in with other New Wave bands, Japan had a unique, serious sound. <BR>&quot;Experience&quot; this album and find out for yourself.
B00006IU73|4.0|Well,after years of following this man/band,I was a bit scared when it was said that this was going to be \\"heavier\\" than past releases!  But,no need to fear ,it's a nice mix of heavy and lighter musics! I should have never thought that Steven Wilson(the band's leader)would have used anything but his great taste in making this music!<BR>   The Cd is a darker affair than the last few,but still has enough points of light to keep it from being a downer.<BR>   The song \\"The Sound Of Muzak\\" has great lyrics that point out all that's wrong with large label ,pre-fab rock...and this is their first large label release!(Talk about BALLS!!HA!)<BR>Strip The Soul,is a comment on family disfunctions that is as scary as that subject should be.<BR>   Gravity Eyelids is a nice trancy piece ,while \\"The Creator Has a Mastertape\\" has my favorite lyric...\\"The creator had a mastertape..but he left it in a cab\\".Referring to Jimi Hendrix's loss of the \\"Axis ;Bold As Love\\" mastertape...he DID leave it in a cab! It's just a cool reference,again proving to me that Steven Wilson even knows his musical trivia...let alone his craft!<BR>    The past has seen the Porcupine Tree play styles of music as diverse as Progressive rock(on The Sky Moves Sideways),Psychedelia(on The Sunday of Life),and also use electronic dance beats..all without losing their identifying style.This is farther proof that Steven Wilson and his band can still grow ,and incorporate more changes ,and yet still satisfy his core group of fans!If you need to see where music can go ,if it's in the hands of tasteful musicians skilled in mixing all these styles,then look no farther!<BR>    This IS the new progressive rock(without all the overblown posturing that the description \\"progressive\\" used to signify)!Thought provoking lyrics,tasteful jams,and powerful riffs to boot!<BR>   Check it out!  Forgive the cover art.
B00005JK8K|4.0|I saw this video when it came out on video/DVD and I liked it. This is a good move. I am a Navajo and we had heard about the Navajo Code Talkers all our lives. They are our heros. I think it is cool that there was a movie made with great people as John Woo, Nicolas Cage, and Adam Beach. It is sad though that Adam Beach got the lead role even though he is not Navajo. <br />I didn't think that there would ever be a movie about our people and if there was it would be limited to some sort of documentary. I was wrong. I hope every one who watcches this movie enjoys it as much as I did.
0880389052|4.0|I enjoyed this book immensely.  I have been reading Forgotten realms novels for about 5 years and I had always avoided this trilogy.  Drizzt never seemed that interesting.  In fact, I have avoided most of R.A. Salvatore's books because I wasn't interested in the dark elf.  Well now I realize my error.  <br />This story explains the early years of Drizzt and is very intriguing.  From the story we learn about drow society and how deceit and deception play an intrigal part in their government.<br />The story was very fast paced and nearly flawless.  My only disappointment is the story did not seem to end.  It seems that the author ended the first book at an obvious point in order to start the next book.  I think part of the problem was that the second to the last chapter was so climatic that the last chapter just seemed like there was something missing.<br />However, like I said in the beginning. This story was excellent and I can't wait to start on the second book.
B00005JK8K|1.0|This is one of the biggest waste of film I have ever watched.  The acting is horrible.  The action is boring, repetitive, senseless.  The plot and dialogue are thin.  The characters are one dimensional.  The movie is predictable.  Go outside, take a walk, play with your kids, ... Any activity is a better use of your time.

B00005BJ9W|5.0|There was a comment made in one of the reviews that RIO has been remastered \\"Too brightly\\". This has prompted me to make a few comments. First, If you live in the U.S. then you will notice that the new CD doesn't have the same mixes as the U.S. release of the record. The rest of the world is happy though. 2nd, RIO Remastered does sound different from the original release CD. It actually sounds like the Vinyl record that I bought in 1982 !! This is thanks to 24 bit mastering. As you know, CD's are 16 bit. They give a full frequency response, 20-20KHz, but Audiophiles often accuse CD's of sounding inferior to Vinyl. Why? Becuase 16 Bit's sampled 44 thousand times a second is not enough to hold audio information. Vinyl or analogue studio tape is equivalent to 24 Bit's in the digital domain. Now with 24 Bit mastering you can hear more in the music! This is why Audiophiles are anxiously waiting to see which 24BIT standard will be accepted (SACD or DVD Audio). Rather than waiting until the cows come home, recording artists/labels have been on a remastering binge. They then convert their new 24Bit master to 16 Bit and issue a remaster on CD. The new CD sounds superior because the coversion to 16Bit's is done using transposiition. To try and explain transposition in detail is beyond the scope of this review. I'd simply explain it by saying that a lot of the sound characteristics of the 24BIT master (that is the detail) is preserved when transposing down to 16 Bit. Its technical trickery. You do end up with a 16 Bit CD, but you CAN hear most of the depth of the master (Just as you can hear the depth in CD's compared to MP3). Of course when the new 24 Bit medium has been standardised and accepted we won't be buying CD's. Until then I will be buying remasted CD's !! Listening to RIO remastered you can hear sounds clearer and some sounds that wern't audible on the original cd release. It's not brightness, it's clarity. Surprise yourself, The clarity shows some little imperfections in, dare I say it, Simon's vocals (Forgive me Simon). Amazing for me was to realise that some of the sounds I thought came from keyboard are actually guitar (with a Chorus Effect). And I can hear South American windpipes in New Religion!The best album from the best 80's group on Planet Earth.
B00006JIA4|5.0|This collection is the perfect start for someone who can´t deside which album to buy in their catalogue. It also provides the american audience with the classics &quot;that should have been in the top&quot; - like elswhere in the world. This collection is the testament that Queen where behind Beatles the most successfull band to rise from Great Britain. Only critics didn´t understand their unique musical skills and their sense of entertainment.<BR>They could mix humour, professionality and excitement.<br />Freddie Mercurys voice and persona had 100% originality and nobody could make the sounds on guitar like Brian May. Everybody in the the band was great songwriters - and it shows in this collection. It´s worth every last penny you got.<br />What would the music world be without: A kind Of Magic, The Show Must Go On, Bo Rhap, Champions, These Are The Days Of Our Lives, I Want It All, Innuendo and Another One Bites The Dust and Crazy Little Thing Called Love?? - A whole lot more boring.<BR>Long live the majesty that was and still is QUEEN.
B00005IC2H|5.0|From the very start of the album to the final beautiful moment, I was in a state of pure happiness and relaxation.  This music is simply brilliant.  Not many albums can take you on a sonic journey that brings you up, down and sideways through your emotions.  The lead vocals are androgynous and very beautiful.  The \\"hopelandic\\" lyrics are mesmerizing.  True, this album is not for everyone.  Sigur Ros are compared to Radiohead a lot, but they're not really like Radiohead.  If you want to hear something different and experimental, check out this album.  I think it's one of the best CD's I've ever bought.  I can't wait to hear the next album, mysteriously titled ( ).
B00005N9CV|5.0|I've got three other Diana Krall albums, and while they are good, they do not take off into the stratosphere like this one does.<br />The lush orchestral arrangements are the ideal setting for Diana's understated approach to singing.  Her delicacy of phrasing somehow lands fully on the exact spot where the meaning of the lyric waits.  It's subtle, but it's a subtlety that is brilliant.<br />The orchestral settings make her piano lines sound better than they ever have before, too.  The Claus Ogerman arrangements are a huge step forward from the few string settings on a previous album (When I look in your eyes).  Instead of &quot;well, let's embellish the trio with a few strings,&quot; Claus give us &quot;let's pull out all the stops to create a really gorgeous orchestral sound.&quot;  But it's a quiet beauty, not an overpowering symphonic approach.  It works beautifully for Diana's singing and playing.<br />There's only one song in this whole set that doesn't make me sit up and say Wow.  (&quot;Cry Me a River.&quot;)  In my opinion her voice is not at its best with the blues.  But you could hardly design a better voice to get every drop of meaning out of the standards.<br />The arrangements are great, the sound is wonderful, and the singing is sensational.  This is not only my favorite Diana Krall album but one of my favorite albums of the last year.
B00005KB9W|5.0|Bob Marley and the Wailers were really on that night in London in 1975.  Like many great live albums in the pantheon of rock music they were able to find their groove early on and it does not stop until the very end of the album.  Bob's singing is as passionate and heartfelt as a blues singer and often times is even more so.  His &quot;sisters,&quot; the female back-up singers, only enhance the songs because their voices are so beautiful.  The guitar and bass playing is, with most reggae, rythmic and melodic and it's impossible to keep from nodding your head or tapping your feet to the beat.  The guitar player pulls off some really great solos that once again only enhances the feeling of the song.  The organ is rythmic and improves the already incredibly tight sound of the rythm section.  It was at this gig that the legendary live recording of &quot;No Woman No Cry&quot; took place.  Perhaps even more impressive is &quot;Get up, stand up&quot; which makes you want to start your own revolution against crooked politicians and everything else that is wrong with this world.  &quot;Stand up for your right&quot;... that's damn right, Bob.  My favourite tracks have to be &quot;Trenchtown Rock,&quot; a perfect opening track, &quot;Lively up yourself,&quot; &quot;Get up, stand up,&quot; and a SWEET song called &quot;Kinky Reggae.&quot;  The bass playing on that song just makes me wanna cry from joy it is so good.  Even though it goes without saying, buy this album as soon as possible.  One Love.
B00004TRD8|5.0|TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY is the DVD to judge all others by.  This dvd earns my highest rating.  The film itself is good as well.  Specifically, this set is laid out better than any I have ever seen.  The menu boards are consistently interesting to look at-you don't necessarily want to just race thru them.  The depth of material buried deep within these discs is amazing.  This is the way all DVD's should be done: extras up the wazoo, deleted scenes that are actually interesting (Cameron should have left a few of them in), storyboards, alternate endings (thank God it wasn't used-although Sarah Connor's final soliloquy is horribly cheesy in the theater version as well), featurettes and the like.  Not to mention the INCREDIBLE picture and sound quality.  Wow.  NO pixelation, NO artifacts, NO pauses, jumps or anything else.  The only other DVD I've seen with comparable picture quality is &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, and that is a reference disc.  <br />So for all of you out there who waited for this film to come out, here it is-the ULTIMATE version of not only this film, but EVERY film yet released on DVD.  It is hard to imagine anything that could make this DVD better, cleaner, crisper, more definitive etc.  This is as good as it gets folks.<br />Essential.
B000069HKH|5.0|I love this cd so much that i wanted to write a review for this cd. I love this cd for 2 reasons: musical beat and that the fact that it is for 9/11/01, so many others are nonsense not all but some. I really like this cd because it is about life after 9/11.<BR> This cd rocks! nuff said! I can see why everyone likes this cd!
B00004X0Q0|3.0|RELATIONSHIP OF COMMAND is a decent disc-I can tell there is some real talent in there, but it seems that most of the tracks are buried under the bands pretentious, overwrought songwriting.  I enjoyed about half of the tunes, the rest just bored me.  I won't say 'disorganized', but I'm not sure how to describe the bizarre 'sructures' of some of this album.  I listen to other material that is more chaotic than this, so it's not that I don't understand what's happening here-I just am not interested in it.  The vocals are ok, but a bit grating over time.  Not my thing, but I know many others like it.  I still give them the benefit of the doubt-I will wait for the next album and give them another try.  This just strikes me as noisy-almost noise for noise's sake.
B000062Y98|2.0|I give this album two stars because the band members are so talented. My overall opinion of this album is not very high. I have never heard anything else by Blind Guardian; I listen mostly to heavier stuff. The musicians do have a lot of talent which draws me from giving this one star but a lot of the songs are just too &quot;catchy&quot; for my tastes. For example, I never owned any Iron Maiden albums but Bruce Dickinson has a great voice. I like to hear vocals done in an aggressive way.  Hansi isn't that bad a singer but this is much lighter than what I normally go for. Just listen to something like &quot;Precious Jerusulam&quot; to see what I'm talking about. &quot;The Maiden and the Minstrel Knight&quot; is perhaps a little more interesting but still I prefer my music heavier.

0316666343|4.0|I loved this book. It reads like poetry in places and like a masterful mystery novel in others. It paints a detailed picture of the afterlife from the point of view of a murdered little girl. From \\"her\\" heaven she follows us through the sobering, surprising and suspenseful reality of her families lives after her death. This story is told with such sensitivity, it may move you to tears. On a brighter note, you are sure to meet a new friend during your commute by merely holding this very popular book. It is widely read for good reason. It's great.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I am not going to talk about the merits of &quot;The Phanom Menace&quot; as it has been gone over a billion times. The movie is an enjoyable sci-fi movie and the DVD transfer is really nice. The extra features on this DVD are pretty sweet. You get to see how movies are made and I was surprised at how honest George Lucas was on the commentary. It is really eye opening to see what it takes to get one of these movies made. Overall a must by for any DVD/sci-fi collector. I can't wait to see what he's going to do with the Original Trilogy on DVD. Now that ought to be fun!
0316666343|5.0|In MY Heaven, this is the book I would write.  An original, heart-breaking yet also heart healing take on the often painful truths of being human.  More than a few times I gasped in recognition of deeply buried feelings.  This is a challenging and almost unbearably gorgeous read.
B00004TRD8|5.0|I think it is safe to say that this is the best dvd ever made well I am thinking of buying spider-man and lord of the rings extended edition i think those two movies will give it a fight,anyway the movie is awesome one of my favs of all time this is the movie where INDUSTRIAL LIGHT AND MAGIC got noticed for their ground breaking special effects any buy this dvd!!!
B00005QDW1|5.0|How could the best ska success possibly get any better? After an album as powerful as \\"Return of Saturn,\\" I thought there was nothing to top their writing skill.<br />Well, with their super-catchy \\"Rock Steady,\\" No Doubt has proved that they are the best-selling ska band for a reason. The still ska-packed \\"Hey Baby\\" and \\"Underneath it All\\" showcase the group's Anaheim roots, while the catchy club favorite \\"Hella Good\\" puts them in the ranks with singers like Madonna and Cher. Other songs such as \\"In My Head\\" and \\"Platinum Blonde Life\\" provide the fusion between ska and dance.  A strange collaboration? Not with musical chameleon Gwen Stefani singing lead! <br />The catchiness of \\"Don't Let me Down\\" is irresistible. The cute yet racy \\"Making Out\\" lends Gwen the sex appeal for which she now strives. I'm not much a fan of \\"Running,\\" \\"Waiting Room,\\" or \\"Rock Steady.\\" And I'm especially unhappy with the poor rip-off of Save Ferris' \\"Superspy\\" they tried for with \\"Detective.\\" But all in all I have to admit, this album almost never leaves my CD changer.<br />The tracks do rock steady and all are highly listenable. There were quite a few tracks I skipped on \\"Return of Saturn.\\" This is a disc I (for the most part) like from start to finish.<br />Very highly recommended.
B000002AH7|5.0|Miles' rendition of the Concierto de Aranjuez is one of the most, if not the most gourgeous song(s) I have ever heard.  Obviously, it was Miles playing, but it is a new style.  Some people, including the composer, J Rodrigo, do not like it, but it is a wonderful fusion of a neo-classical concerto with a more modern jazz feel.  In fact, if only to hear this, the album would be worth it.  The more defined Will O' The Wisp and Pan Piper create a nice contrast.  Saeta is strikingly different.  The marchlike style is in sharp contrast to most Miles, in fact.  However, it is still very beautiful and the trumpet mechanics are second to none.  The Soleta is a very beautiful, soleful piece that melds nicely with the Concierto.  Song of Our Country is an interesting work.  The rehersal take of the Concierto is strikingly beautiful.  Some people consider this a strange, out-there album that is not Miles Davis.  I feel that it just shows how unique Miles really was, and his legacy cannot be discussed without talking about Sketches of Spain.  Many people love it, or just think it's plain weird.  I encourage buying this album because of all the wonderful contrasts.
B00006AFUR|5.0|30STM is one of the BEST new bands I have ever heard, I don't like many new bands because they usually don't have seem to have any notion of how to play their chosen instruments. But it was different when I heard 30STM, I immediately fell in love with their unique sense of rythm and attitude. I know, I know you want to know about the songs...well, the cd starts out with their single Capricorn (a brand new name) which sets an amazing tone for the album. The ambient synthesizer mixed with Adam Jones-like guitar riffs make this album all the more interesting and sensational. <BR>    They're aren't many hang-ups on this cd, the only thing close to a hang-up is that Jared sometimes sounds like Bono from U2 which is somewhat unnerving, but besides that, this is an exceptionally well-made album. <br />And remember...<br />                     30 SECONDS TO MARS!
B000066AXC|4.0|This is a movie that recieved Academy Awards for a reason, it's much better than I thought it was going to be.  The best thing about this movie is the AMAZING acting.  You would think that Russell Crowe was really like that and they just filmed him one day.  Jennifer Connely was just as good as his wife.  It was a great movie, but it was just a little too slow for me.  Oh well, the great story made up for that.
B00006F7S4|4.0|'music is god's greatest gift' -- with Sea Change, it seems beck has returned that gift to its sender, and with interest. start to finish, the album is earthwormishly slow, rhythmically void, all with a dash of van Gogh. but isn't this what typifies the underlying beauty and genius of beck's music. life is like a box of chocolates? sorry gump, life is a beck album, there's not a snowball's chance in heck you can predict what you're going to get. <BR>merriam-webster should add this album as an example of melancholy, and, dare i say it, brilliant! feeling depressed, hurt, betrayed, even a little masochistic? try it on for size, because each time i do, i walk away forgetting what i was upset about.<BR>and remember all, it's 'nobody's fault but my (your) own' if you pass by this masterpiece.
0060283122|5.0|If your one of those people who likes books with good/happy beginings and endings then you should definetily not read this series. The Bad Begining is the first book in The Series of Unfortunate Evnts. <BR>          There arr three Baudelaire children, Violet, Klause, and Sunny, one day they were playing on the beach when a man named Mr. Poe comes to tell them that there parents had died in a house fire. At that moment the chidren thought their lives would never be the same and it wasn't. Mr. Poe took them to their, third cousin four times removed, Count Olaf. He was a tall man with one eyebrow. He had an eye tatoo on his left ankle.<BR>          As the children went on with their live they relized that they did not like Count Olaf as much as they thought they would. He was a rude a crule man with no good heart at all. The Baudelaire orphans had a great fortane after their parent died, witch could not be accessed until Vilot became of age. Count Olaf wanted thier fortune soooo bad he tried anything he could to get it. He devised a plane to get it.<BR>        If you want to find out what his plan was, if he succeeded, and what happened to the orphans read The Bad Begining By Lemony Snicket.<BR>        I would rate this book with 5 stars because it was one of the best books I have ever read.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I fell in love with this movie when I was ten years old, and ten years later, I am once again truly &quot;enchanted&quot; by its magic. The characters are made more &quot;alive&quot; through the sound and color qualities. Learning about the animation process, as told by different people, made me appreciate the beauty of this masterpiece even more, knowing how much effort was put into it. Plus, my younger siblings love the games! :) I loved it then, and I love it all the more now, with the additional features! Great job! I'm sure this will be treasured by many households for the generations to come.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|This is definitely the best DVD purchased so far. Contains extra features including John Williams Live score track, Making of Featurette, Reunion Featurette, and much more. Just as a footnote, both versions Theatrical and 2002 version contain Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 even though the back of the container states Dolby Surround for Disc 2. It is also included with the theatrical version as well as Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 sound.<br />This is one of my favorite films of all time and always makes me cry during the last 30 minutes. It is for all members of the family young and old and is multi-cultural. I plan on keeping this DVD for as long as it will last.

B00005MKA3|5.0|In the interest of full disclosure, I admit to being a Jamiacan music fanatic, love everything from Mento to hardcore Dancehall.<br /> And this is not my very favorite Bob album (thats reserved for Catch a Fire - you know what they say: you never forget your first)BUT: Survival is an absolute brilliant piece of music-making. From the clarion call of the opening track to \\"Wake up  and Live, ya'll - wake up and live....\\" to the repeated admonition to \\"tell the children the truth\\" in Babylon System, the lyrics on this album are Bob at his very best: passionate, angry, caring, concerned, moving, persuasive, original: with an almost Biblical authority and a heartfelt authenticity that makes you feel as if Bob is speaking directly to YOU, straight outta Yard.  Marley's ability to truly connect through these lyrics with everyone (from subarban white Americans to Moari tribespeople and everyone in between) while remaining true to himself and his heritage as a jamaican and member of the african diaspora is on bravura display throughout.  For example: 'they bribe us with their guns, spare parts and money... and if you want to get some food, your brother's got to be your enemy...\\" A more succint and pointed description and indictment of superpower \\"realpolitik\\" foriegn policies would be harder to imagine.<br />And that's just the lyrics.  The riddims between Bob, Carly and Familyman on this collection are SO hard, SO right & tight, SO in the pocket, it's hard to describe without simply throwing superlatives at it in a lame attempt to put into words what must be heard to be understood.  The album makes extensive yet tasteful use of additional percussion (i.e. the african agogo bells in Ride Natty Ride) throughout, musically reflecting and enhancing the albums' lyrical focus on afrocentric concerns.<BR>The saxaphone is also very heavily used, and it comes off great: I don't know who the soloist is, but he makes that horn growl and wail like a slave under the whip.<br />Another high point of the collection is the general songwriting. The melodies and structures of the songs reflect Bob's place as one of THE PREMIER pop songwriters ever - up there in Lennon/McCartney, Leiber/Stoller, Goffin/King, Rogers/Hart,  territory - he drops out the 3-4 minute gem as naturally as breathing.  Ever notice how Bob had distinct verse, chorus AND bridge sections in his mature output...?  And still maintains the intergrity of the reggae form.<br />This album is worth repeated listening for Bob fans, reggae fans, pop music fans, and any lover of music with open ears. If anyone ever argues against Bob's place in music (i.e. he ONLY did reggae, his songs are simple, reggae is all the same, his lyrics stink, he was too \\"pop\\", he wasn't \\"pop\\" enough, etc), throw this on, adjust the bass up a notch or two and CRANK it. <BR>If they don't change their mind, then they don't know anything  about music...
B000006E17|4.0|\\"All things are good when done to excess\\". SALO is set at the tail end of WW2 in the Fascist Republic of Salo, Italy. SALO opens with men of great social prestige, among them a Duke, a President and a Bishop marrying each others daughters. Then young men and women are brought before them and forced to expose their genitals before being herded out like cattle. The first girl is told that no one will harm her before she is stripped for the men. Girls with any physical imperfections are sent back to their families. They're the lucky ones.<BR>The youths are then instructed about the Hall Of Orgies where the daily debaucheries will take place and any act of religion, even uttering God's name will see them severely punished.<BR>The teens are presented as nothing more than objects, playthings for the wealthy men, though there is an instance of one girl comforting another when she confides she can't take the humiliation anymore. However there is a strange scattering of the blackest humor, so dark that you dare not laugh. In contrast to SALO's explicit visual imagery the interiors of the rooms are beautifully filmed, rooms in which the three circles of SALO are introduced with the tormentors telling each other a debauched tale before the ritual:<br />1 CIRCLE OF MANIAS: This sequences features a philosophical conversation quoting the likes of Nietzsche and Dada and ends with a teen girl being force fed a cake studded with nails.<br />2 CIRCLE OF EXCREMENT (actually chocolate): For using God's name another girl is stripped and forced to eat human excrement off the floor. The high stature men then eat their victims \\"waste\\" for dinner. One of the men gets a girl to \\"urinate\\" on him (actually orange juice).<br />3 CIRCLE OF BLOOD: The victims are ordered to laugh and sing. Given their past ordeals this innocent act now seems like the most degrading of them all.<br />But this seems to rub off on some of the victims and they become as bad as their captors. Pasolini seems to be asking if sickness breeds sickness. Is SALO, at its core a desperate cry for peace? Judge for yourself. [...] Myself? Sitting here with the sun streaming through the window I am grateful that I am alive and have my basic freedoms. And that, in a nutshell is what SALO should make viewers think. <PKiwis I encourage you to see this before David Lame and his ignorant friends get it banned again. The SPCS should see this, but they're probably scared it might broaden their worldview.

B00005R87Q|3.0|They go hand in hand don't they.  So do you really need to read the review of a movie that has Vin Diesel.  Story...[...]...But what Vin Diesel brings to a movie is the next action star hype.  This movie is incredibly fast paced.  From the opening scence which shows Paul Walker as Brian O' Connor speeding down the road in his suped up street car turned race car.  Although it supposedly gives us a line into the underground racing world, it's still a little hard to swallow.<br />But like I said there is action and lot's of it.  The DVD is cool because it explains that they actually used some of the underground racing community to fill in as extra's.  The Special deleted scenes are pretty good, and it shows several different camera angles for the truck scene at the end, which is pretty intense.  <br />I wouldn't buy the DVD if I could go back and change my decision, but it is definatley worth renting and watching if for nothing else than the special effects.

B000065U1N|4.0|There is somewhat of a debate over who is to blame for the October 1993 incident in Mogadishu. I will try to present a viewpoint of it. <br />In late 1992, with his term as President coming to an end, George Bush senior sent American troops to Somalia, after some pressure from groups such as the United Nations, to act as humanitarians by aiding the people there. Thus, you can blame Bush for committing us (And, if you want to go further, blame the U.N for pressuring involvement). However, when Clinton took office, he had the humanitarians removed and Rangers and Delta Forces put in their place. The situation was also escalated: The Battle of Mogadishu (Which is also the event shown in \\"Black Hawk Down\\") occurred as a result of the hunt for one of the Somalia Warlords and for some of his top men. Much different from the intentions of Bush senior. So, you can blame Clinton as well. <br />I come from a family that is pro-republican, so I can't help but pick up on some of their beliefs. I do admit that Bush has some of the blame, but I also think he had the best of intentions for doing so. Some of my relatives talk of Clinton like he was Hitler. Fault can be put on him solely for the fact he was our leader at the time. But he too had good intentions by having a mission planned to go after those responsible for the violence. To end the harm being done to the civilians, is there any better solution then going after the roots of the evil?  <br />The real blame for the battle's outcome was in the planning of the raid. The U.S underestimated the strength and skill of the Somalia troops whiles overestimating itself. We thought it would be a straight hit and run mission, taking no more than half an hour to an hour. Our men also weren't supplied with proper air and ground support (The pentagon said it was to prevent escalating the conflict, forgetting that sending in armed troops was defeating that purpose). In the end, we had about 18 dead and many more wounded, two helicoptersshot down (With one pilot held hostage) and embarrassment on our faces. The defeat in Somalia still echoes in our military: Nowadays, the policy is that we have the will to get involved in fights we have no part of, yet won't go all the way in terms of suffering casualties. The U.N, Bush, Clinton, our army generals, troops and everyone else could not have foreseen what would happen and shouldn't have their whole careers judged solely by this. Still, they all should have anticipated that something bad might occur: As stated in \\"Bridge on the River Kwai\\", `Expect the unexpected'. <br />Now as to what I thought of \\"Black Hawk Down\\". I thought it was a compelling war picture with some gut-wrenching battle scenes. I also liked how it avoided being patriotic cornball or a sadistic accusation (Though understandable, considering it came out after 9/11). However, it was often hard to tell who was who during the battle scenes. And many people are upset by the lack of human involvement with the characters (Not me though: I've heard some good theories about the men being developed as a unit rather than as individuals. And what did you want instead: The cliched stock characters as used in past war movies?). Still, four stars and a recommendation from me.
0679735909|5.0|A.S. Byatt's Possession will continue to amaze, bewilder, and infect you with its magic long after you finish reading this engrossing book.  Possession is about literature, love, Victorians, and scholars, but they all boil down to that hunger for knowledge - of self, of others, of life.<br />There are two sets of players - modern-day Roland and Maud who search for 19th-century Randolph Ash and his muse, Christabel LaMotte.  Reading this work is almost overwhelming at times - there is poetry, mystery, literary theory, and romance practically surging out of its pages.  It's emotional, heady, and consuming - an unexpected adventure that takes place in the typically staid world of literary research.<br />The characters drive each moment of the plot, and are wonderfully executed.  This is old-fashioned good writing.  People and places come alive effortlessly and remain with you whether you are reading the book at the moment or not.  It feels almost like fantasy the way you slip into their world with every turn of the page.  As for the Ash/LaMotte literature in the work, I was surprised to realize that it was all fabricated by the author herself.  I had thought the writings were partly borrowed from real literary figures.  The scope and depth of these embellishments are well worth the time and effort if only to marvel at the impeccable performance.<br />Byatt accomplishes so much in the 555 pages, that the only way to do justice to the work is simply to read it.  A thrilling, stunning work, beautifully and emotionally uplifting.

0316666343|4.0|Alice Sebold turns a morose and horrible subject into something spiritual and full of grace.  As a mother of two girls (13yrs and 10yrs), I picked this book up and put it back down too many times to count.  How could I read about a rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl?  But I did and I'm so glad I did.  Alice Sebold made me believe that my grandmother and grandfathers were looking over my shoulder as I read the book.  She made me believe that if I left this world that I would be able to 'communicate,' like Susie the narrator in \\"Lovely Bones,\\" with the ones I left behind.  Her prose is elegant and descriptive without being over the top.  The one part that seemed a bit rushed and melodramatic was the end...  I've told everyone I know, stop what you're reading and read \\"Lovely Bones\\" now.

044651652X|5.0|If you are are crazy about romance novels, than this is a extroidenary read for you.  This tear jerking sensual novel will even make you feel the emotions running through your soul.  <br />Fransesca Johnson, a farm wife in Iowa married her husband Richard whom she met in Italy.  Richard was stationed in the Army when they married and they went on to make a family with two loving children.  This novel took a turn when Richard and the children went out of town on a short trip for only a couple of days, how could a few days without her family cause Fransesca to fall in love so fast?<br />It was a normal day for Fransecsa up until an unexpected knock was heard on her door.  She opened it to see a gentleman standing on the top step looking lost.  Robert Kincaid, a photographer for National Geographic was on an assignment to photograph old Briges of Madison County, Iowa.  An enexpected romance blossomed at that time and love was in the air. <br />It took only days for Fransesca and Robert to fall in love.  The depth and power of their love made the whole world revolve around the two.  <br />I recommend this book mainly for ages sixteen and older.  It is a very sensual book, with a marital affair I don't recommend it for anyone much younger.  The writers style will capture your attention so fast.

B00005JL78|4.0|\\"Minority Report\\" is a fine movie but it could have been better if it put more stress on building the atmosphere and less on the display of various impressive futuristic gadgets in every possible chance (the personalized ads were an interesting exception though!).<br />But don't get me wrong. I am a fan of good sci-fi movies and \\"Minority Report\\" certainly fits to this description. Still, it is a notch below excellent movies like \\"Blade Runner\\".<br />It belongs to the category that cinemagoers like to call \\"thinking sci-fi movies\\" since the plot is not just a pretense for an avalanche of action sequences. Rather than that, the plot is the focal point of the film itself. And it is a rather scary plot indeed. It calls for a future society where a special police force, rightfully called \\"Precrime\\", arrests \\"criminals\\" before they commit their crime.<br />Anderton (Tom Cruise) is a detective, who, after the loss of his son in a weird pool accident, becomes totally devoted to this task. He is the best in his job, until one day, the system that he blindly serves, accuses him for a crime of a person he doesn't even know....<br />Cruise feels very comfortable in all his action scenes - and there are many of these in the film - while he is not bad either in scenes revealing his wounded emotional self...Sydow, and Samantha Morton, offer a strong supporting cast.<br />Steven Spielberg, with the help of Janusz Kaminski in cinematography, do a splendid job indirection...Look closely at his camerawork in some of the action scenes.<br />I also have to note a couple of sequences that vividly reminded me of a David Lynch movie: the first one is the \\"eye-popping\\" operation that Anderton has to go through, in order to fool the authorities, and the second one involves an old lady with a pipe. Not bad at all!<br />In general, this is a film I surely recommend. Still the story leaves a number of important issues open. And I would prefer it if some of the action sequences were left out infavour of providing us some more food for the mind.<br />
0871137380|5.0|Simply the best book I have read regarding military battle.  Mark Bowden has doen an incredible job of giving the reader a 360 degree view of the battles in Mogadishu, from the soldiers on the ground, to the Somalis they were fighting, to the \\"eyes in the sky\\" above.  His story telling brings the reader into the battles and shows the true nature of urban combat as well as the resolve, training and professionalism those on the ground had against overwhelming forces.  <br />A strong point to the book are the human faces these battles have.  The physical and emotional pain suffered during the battle by its participants.  It is not a pretty picture, but it shows the dedication they had to the \\"man next to them\\".  The story of the 2 Delta Force troopers, who knew of the odds against them, refusing to leave a stranded pilot behind jumping out of a helicopter into enemy fire is only one example.  There are many such stories in this book, as there may be in every battle of every war.  The difference here is the writing and reporting by the author.<br />For the government (i.e. - Clinton) not wanting to make too much of a presence with the use of armored troop vehicles that could have been used in our soldiers rescue, this sure did not end quietly...
0395389496|5.0|This was my favorite book when I was little.  My aunt would read it to me every Christmas, and when I was old enough, I read it to her.  I now get this book almost every year to give to friends and family with small children to start their own tradition.  The best version of this book was a gift set that was created for the 10th anniversary.  It included a bell that you could hear (read the book to hear what that's all about) and a cassette in a nice box.  Sadly, it's not made anymore.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone, young and old.  The pictures and words are beautiful.  It truly is what Christmas is all about.
B000022TSY|5.0|Easy Rider resonated with film-goers, especially those of us of the male gender, when it was released because it tells the tale of man's secret desire to just chuck it all and take off and BE FREE. Those of us who grew up in the late '60s are aware of Henry David Thoreau's comment that, \\"The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.\\" Well, Captain America (whose real name in the movie was Wyatt) and Billy didn't. They did it their way. Yeah, they ultimately paid the ultimate price (I assume everyone knows how it ends by NOW...), but man, oh, man did they have fun along the way. Jack Nicholson's role made him a star after he'd struggled through minor roles in movies like \\"Angels Die Hard\\" and \\"Mister Roberts\\" (or was it \\"Ensign Pulver\\"?). The big debate among those of us back in the day was, should they have stayed at the commune or should they have moved on? I always voted for moving on and then returning to the commune. (Yeah, OK, some aspects of this movie are very, very dated...) And the other was, who did WE want to be, the cool Captain America or the antic, frantic Billy (the Kid...). (If you didn't catch it early, get the names: Wyatt (Earp) and Billy (the Kid)... Yeah, it's a cliche, but it was fun anyway.) The DVD is good, but I sure hope someday that a better print makes it to DVD. This one now is about an 8 out of 10, and I'm sure there has to be a crystal clear print SOMEWHERE. But that misgiving aside, the music's fun, especially for younger viewers who've never heard \\"Don't Bogart Me\\" and the movie's a classic. I have seen it a hundred times and I'll probably see it another hundred times -- every time I get tired of when I'm tired of being part of the mass of men living lives of quiet desperation.
0380729407|5.0|I first read this book ten years ago when I was 13.  At the time, I didn't understand the metaphors and symbolism that Bradbury's books are known for.  I enjoyed it at the time, but it still wasn't one of my favorites.  But now as I reread the book, I realize how great of a book this is.  As I mentioned, like other of his books like Fahrenheit 451, this book uses a lot of metaphors.  <br />Anyways, I've been re-reading many of his books recently, and this is one of my favorites.  I couldn't put it down and I read it less than a day.  It's not really extremely scary, but the atmosphere and dialogue is masterful and tends to make the book have a mysterious and somewhat creepy feeling.  It doesn't resort to violence and death to create this atmosphere as too many of today's \\"horror\\" novels do.  <br />It is essentially the tale of two boys, Jim and Will, who discover that the carnival that has come to town is evil.  It is run by Mr. Dark, and a bunch of freaks that are pretty much actually souls that he captured.  The two boys and Will's father much get rid of the carnival before it \\"destroys\\" more people.  <br />Overall, this book is excellent.  While it isn't extremely scary, it is still a great piece of literature with a creepy atmosphere.  It is as much a book about growing up as it is about terror and horror.  I would recommend it to almost anyone who will understand the Bradbury metaphors.  Another Bradbury classic.
B00003CXFG|5.0|I origionaly thought this movie about 3 and 1/2 stars, but the more I see it, the more I like it. Any girl (or guy for that matter) who thinks vin Diesel is hot will love this movie. The whole thing is him stalking around in a tight black tank top and acting like a badass. I really don't see how the other main charactor, Fry or whatever her name is, resisited the urge to jump on him and start... And further more ...But other than that, it really is a pretty good movie, and even if it had some other not so hot guy in it, probably would have enjoyed it anyway.
0783226004|5.0|SNEAKERS is a great caper flick with minimal violence and an ensemble cast one would never expect would ever be put on screen. Who would think that a movie would contain the likes of Robert Redford, Dan Aykroyd, David Strathairn (Eight Men Out, League of Their Own), Mary McDonnell (Dances with Wolves), River Phoenix (Dog Fight, Stand by Me), and the great Sidney Poitier to boot. It's fun, light, and suspensful.  Redford heads a group of high tech misfits who troubleshoot and hack security systems.  They are hired by a renegade government agency to steal a device that can decipher electronic coded messages developed by a mathematical genius, but get caught up into something more sinister than they bargained for as people begin getting kidnapped and murdered.  Great characters including Dan Aykroyd's tailor made 'Mother' who sprouts off any conspiracy theory at whim, David Straithairn's blind hacker 'Whistler' whose ears can \\"see\\" more than anyone's eyes and whose only need in life is peace and good will towards his fellow man, and a great cameo by Ben Kingsley as the vengeful 'Cosmo' who is behind all the evil doings.  Overall, a great cast, great script and first class entertainment!!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I don't know what all the \\"love it\\"/\\"hate it\\" stuff's about. This is an engrossing and galvanizing film. Director Darren Aronosfky has achieved deserved recognition for this morality fable about the destruction of four lives by drug addiction. Wonderful performances put this tale right in your face. The stuff dreams are made of is heroin and diet pills. The characters write their own requiem as they descend into hell. Not for the faint-hearted or weak-stomached but well worth watching for the performances---especially Ellen Burstyn who was Oscar nominated for her work here. Jared Leto as her son, Marlon Wayans as his buddy and Jennifer Connelly as Leto's girlfriend all turn in fine jobs as the doomed souls who sell out for the \\"Dream\\". Sad, depressing but fascinating viewing if a bit heavy-handed at times. A damn fine film nonetheless.
0425152251|1.0|and that is where Sophie was when she read this stuff - a freshman no less.  This book had the pretention of covering 3000 years of human thought in 400 pages.  I found the plot rather dull and full of unabashedly two-dimensional characters (mere props to the supposesd discourse that was going on) and the coverage of philosophy so standard and without character that it felt like I was reading &quot;cliff notes.&quot;<br />Coverage of anything that I knew well was a disappointment.  The one chapter on the Middle ages covers 1000 years and barely even mentions the achievements of scholasticism, which arguably became a pillar as important to modern science as Kepler's discoveries.  OK, you can't cover everything, but that points to the deepest flaw in this book:  it is far too ambitious.  As such, this is a book for yuppies who want to feel like they are learning something and being significant by reading about an entire epoch in a half an hour.<br />Not recommended.

0684833395|3.0|Mark Twain said that a classic is a book that everybody praises but nobody reads. I'd like to add that a classic is often praised now because it was praised in the past. Some classics are timeless and can make their point in any period, but others are useful for a certain amount of time then lose their effectiveness. \\"Catch-22\\" clearly falls into the second category. When this book was written back in the 50's it was necessary to give the world a reaction to the mythology of World War II. The soldiers in the war were still being worshipped as perfect humans with a perfect love for their country and unlimited bravery and courage to save the world. Surely some of the soldiers were not so perfect and that's what Joseph Heller shows us in this book. In the character of Yossarian, we have a WWII soldier who was not the epitome of courage, but a slacker and malcontent who did everything he could to get out of his duty. But Heller takes this way too far as the book becomes an extremely repetitive parade of soldiers who do nothing but try to weasel their way out of service or stab each other in the back; and officers who are inept bureaucrats who are under-qualified for their positions of authority and are focused on their own self-interest rather than winning the war. With this never-ending parade of idiots, Heller not only makes the statement that some of the fighting men in WWII were not up to the stereotypical ideal. He keeps on repeating the implication that they were ALL unworthy. He makes this point early on but fails to expand on it other than beating it to death repeatedly. While \\"Catch-22\\" is still useful as a good example of non-conformist and subversive literature, it has aged badly. Some \\"classics\\" are relevant in any time period, but the era in which this book's points were truly necessary is long gone.

B000021Y7X|5.0|I've been a Heads fan since 1980, when my brother sent me a tape with songs from Fear Of Music on it.  They just got better and better after that (at least 'til Naked, but that's another story).  <br />I almost saw the Stop Making Sense concert in Detroit in mid-83, but had strep throat.  Later that year, I had the good fortune to see them in Binghamton, NY.  WOW!!  One review describes the crescendo from Psycho Killer to Burning Down The House as orgasmic.  That perfectly sums up the build up in the concert.  By the time they played Burning Down The House, everyone was dancing and no one sat down 'til it was over!<br />(I'm reminded of the amp in Spinal Tap that goes to 11.  He claims that when most bands hit 10, they've got no where to go.  This concert does it for real.  Most bands come out all at once and really have no where to go.  TH found a beautiful way to find somewhere to go)<br />All this is a prelude to say that the DVD captures this wonderfully.  Each time I watch, I am back there watching it, in heaven on earth!  It just doesn't get old; their music is as fresh and innovative today as it was back then.  I just watched it again yesterday:  same delight as always.  I've even managed to get my 3 kids hooked on them.<br />The DVD also does a wonderful job capturing the band's delight and playfulness.  In the concert I saw, Byrne handed his mike to Steve Scales to take off part of his big suit (too hot, I'm sure).  He got hung up in the suit, and it was time to sing again, but Scales ran away, forcing Byrne to hop frantically after him to get it back!  You see similiar fun in the DVD.<br />The switch to The Tom Tom Club in the middle was an utterly unexpected delight, and was a wonderful complement to the TH music.<br />Even if you're not a TH fan, give this a try - I do not think there has ever been any concert that was this good.
B000002U9W|5.0|i only have two things two say.  <br />1.  I am a Pink Floyd historian.<br />2.  This is their greatest album instrumentally EVER.  Atom Heart Mother (the song) is one of the greatest single songs in the history of the world.  Every emotion is displayed and projected, it is absolutely captivating.  There is no other band like this.  If you are a Floyd fan (and not a trendy wish you were here and dark side and the wall radio fan) get this album.  if you like floyd songs like run like hell you WILL NOT like this album.
B00006AG5N|1.0|I would give this travesty less than one star if I could. Only RCA would crow about these songs being taken from the ORIGINAL masters and then REMIX them so they DON'T sound like Presley's original recordings.  (Incidentally guys, if this monstrosity is the first ELVIS on compact disc to utilize the original &quot;masters,&quot; why do the 50's, 60's, and 70's boxes all feature the term &quot;masters&quot; so prominently in their titles???)<br />  In a bid to ensure this is a huge Holiday seller, RCA has pulled original catalogue albums - the true classic records Elvis cut when he was alive - from the marketplace, leaving 30 #1 Hits as just about the only option consumers have if they want to hear Elvis on cd. It's a brilliant, shrewd piece of marketing confirming an inescapable truth:  RCA and The Colonel made the real money; Elvis got the short end of the stick.
0345442989|1.0|Eighty percent of this book is political machinations setting up for the events of TPM. There is no action (like in the Darth Maul book); no character development (like in the Jedi Apprentice series); no interesting characters (like in the AOTC Alan Dean Foster prequel book). By all means read this if you like Star Wars, but expect to be bored.
B000007OY0|5.0|Frank Darabont's classic prison yarn based on a Stephen King novella (that is well worth reading) has only gained its fame retrospectively.  Failing at the box office it has since become a classic among modern movies.  The story has wealthy banker Andy (Robbins) jailed in Shawshank for the murder of his wife and her lover.  Whilst there he makes friends with Red (Freeman), the 'man who can get things'.<br />This is one of those rare films where the story isn't really at the forefront of the picture.  Rather Darabont takes his time to introduce us to his characters and build up a realistic and touching friendship between the two Shawshank lifers.  This is a movie that tackles with such tricky themes as hope, friendship and freedom of spirit and pulls them all off in spectacular style.  Never resorting to schmaltz or unnecessary violence this hits you in all the right places without ever putting a foot out of place.  In fact, for a prison film this is surprisingly tender, proving once and for all that this is a genre that can have a wide appeal when done right.<br />'The Shawshank Redemption' also benefits from fleshing out the plot of the original novella (which is only just over 100 pages) by drawing out several characters into some genuinely moving storylines.  Of particular notice is a young Gil Bellows (who most will probably recognise as Billy from 'Ally McBeal'), as an aggressive youth who wants to get some qualifications.  There's also the story of the librarian .<br />Of course, what holds the movie together most of all are the performances by the two male leads, who both give the performances of their respective careers.  Whilst never becoming mushy they both act out beautifully the depth of the friendship and the deep desire for freedom to perfection.  .<br />This established Darabont as one of the most exciting new directors around and remains one of the best movies of its genre ever made.  Almost universally liked, 'The Shawshank Redemption' will not disappoint.
B00006IU73|5.0|This has to be the most consistently 'good' band I have ever come across.  Except maybe for Camel, who also continue to over-achieve with each new release.  Porcupine Tree is simply amazing.  They issue something incredible without repeating a formula and have been doing it since The Sky Moves Sideways.  It's difficult to pick a favorite Porcupine Tree record, because it tends to be 'the one which is in the player now.'  However, In Absentia is one juicy piece after another.  You owe it to your ears to check this out...but, give it at least 5 good listens before passing judgement, it will gel before your ears!
B00000DC10|1.0|The shape of punk to come?<br />I hope to hell not!<br />First off, more heavy metal headbanging tunes than anything else.<br />More Metalica than The Clash.<br />If you liked Killdozer, this might be for you.<br />Old has become new again, get some Dead Kennedys, Germs, Bad Brains, Fear, Sex Pistols, Richard Hell, Black Flag, OpIvy, Descendants, Subhumans, Exploited, Stooges, Ramones, even The Vandals, before you even think about getting this. Then think again!
B00006C79E|5.0|After exploring jangly-candy-coated rock a la the Cardigans (&quot;Good Humour&quot;) and minimalistic electronica (&quot;Sound Of Water&quot;), Saint Etienne joyously return to dance-oriented pop, reminiscent of their first three albums (particularly &quot;Tiger Bay&quot;) and the results are fantastic.<br />Album opens with the one-two punch of &quot;Action&quot; (the first single) and &quot;Amateur.&quot;  An interesting guest slot on &quot;Soft Like Me,&quot; Wildflower provides a brit-girl rap (!) as Sarah sings a chorus that will get stuck in your brain after only one listen.  &quot;Shower Scene&quot; is begging for a floor-filling dance club remix, and &quot;New Thing&quot; utilizes new wave era/electroclash/analogue synth sounds, all the while sounding modern and relevent.... a song that is definitely single-worthy.<br />In an interesting twist, British actor Michael Jayston provides spoken-word vocal interludes between the tracks.  Some of his narratives are rather humorous (&quot;Our Father, who art in Heaven, please stay there&quot;), but ultimately I don't think this aspect of the album really works.  I found his voice to be a bit of an interruption in the flow.<br />Regardless, I'm thrilled with this album.  It's their best since &quot;Good Humour&quot; and if they ever deserved some mainstream success, now would be the perfect time for it.
B00006JIAF|3.0|I'm very late to hop on the Strokes' bandwagon, but I finally got around to picking this up and it's easy to see why there is so much &quot;buzz&quot; around this band. The music is high energy and the instrumentation is always good and sometimes exhilarating. &quot;Last Nite&quot; is about as catchy as you can get, and several other songs also caught my attention, specifically &quot;Soma&quot;, &quot;Someday&quot;, &quot;Hard To Explain&quot;, and &quot;Trying Your Luck&quot;. Grungy guitars galore! But the one complaint I have is with the vocals, which are all electronically processed. It sounds like Julian Casablancas has a perfectly fine voice, and I know I would have liked the album far more if they had just left his vocals alone. Instead, he sounds like he's singing through a tin can on a string. If not for that, I would have given this 5 stars. By the way, I bought the edition with the bonus DVD, but I don't have a DVD player so cannot comment on that aspect of it.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Though I never discounted Beck's talent, the problem I always found with Beck's material is that it had a short shelf life.  Maybe it had something to do with the fact that alt-rock radio plays the hell out of a lot of his stuff and makes its relevance become almost a parody of itself.<br />Welcome to Sea Change.  Lush, moody, and melodic it makes you want to grab a stiff drink, turn off the lights, sit down, stare at the walls and listen.  Sonically challenging and lyrically beautiful, Beck's sad examination of his recent breakup with his longtime girlfriend is honest and sad enough to perfectly describe a human relationship.<br />Like every Beck recording, continued listens expose something new and interesting.  Sea Change differs in that its musical and lyrical intelligence catches you at many points.  Rather than surprising you with samples, crytic references, and off sounds, Beck takes you with the capture of emotion in sound.<br />Creative sounding without alienating the listener, Sea Change is what the people who called Beck genius knew him capable of.
B00006RHOM|4.0|2002 saw a huge breakthrough for No Doubt.  After the disappointing sales of their previous album 'Return To Saturn', Gwen Stefani's image enhancement courtest of high profile collaborations with Eve and Moby and a change in musical direction made them once again the flavour of the month.  Moving away from the ska they had made on their older albums No Doubt went for a much more dancefloor image that not only paid off in record sales but worked for the group.  However, whilst the image overhaul won over several new fans, the older ones seemed disenchanted, maintaining that the group had 'sold out'.  This isn't really the case, especially listening to some really fine quality cuts here.<br />The singles are obviously the songs to pick out, and if 'Hey Baby' and 'Underneath It All' are good, then 'Hella Good' is No Doubt at their very peak.  It's the kind of song to rival 'Just A Girl' on their 'Tragic Kingdom' album, or 'Simple Kind Of Life' from their 'Return Of Saturn' album.  Basically the album screams attitude and this is no hollow shout; if there's one band that's got it then it's No Doubt.  Working alongside producer Nellee Hooper (famous for her work on the 'Romeo &amp; Juliet' soundtrack) they've produced a slick album that's jam-packed with great tunes that are among the best dancefloor songs written in recent years.  Songs like 'Making Out' or 'Detective' are just so much fun that you can't help but wonder why people were so upset with the change in direction.  Even if the album does run out of steam towards the end this is certainly no reason to pass the band off as typical or mediocre.  Anyone who listens to this album will be blown away by most of the tracks and only slightly underwhelmed by perhaps the last two tracks.  Even if it's not quite as good as 'Return Of Saturn' or 'Tragic Kingdom', it is clear that No Doubt are a long way from running out of ideas and are one of the most refreshing bands on the scene at the moment.<br />Given this it's a shame that when the album was given the bonus CD treatment it offered very little.  The videos to the singles were already available on the previous album or the singles themselves, as were the remixes.  Still, anyone unfamiliar with No Doubt's 'Return Of Saturn' stage will be pleased with the inclusion of the superb 'Ex-Girlfriend'.
B000002H3E|4.0|As far as image goes, this was about as hair metal as Dokken ever got.  The music is great on this disc, particularly \\"It's Not Love,\\" which is one of the more perfect songs Dokken ever did.  It all comes together on that tune.  The riffs are typical George Lynch, with his characteristic alteration between clean and heavy riffing, Don Dokken's excellent lead vox, a pounding '80's rhythm section and pretty cool lyrics to boot!<br />The rest of the album is fairly strong, but a bit uneven.  \\"In My Dreams\\" has the stereotypical over-produced background vocal style of the '80's and a couple of songs like \\"Slippin' Away\\" pass through me like filler.  But it's still a good listen.  Like most Dokken, it's fun to hear how this four piece can sound so full and interesting with the very unorthodox playing of Lynch.   Lynch gives each song a lot of breathing room and always seems to know how to riff just enough but not too much.  And his solos always give you a few surprises as well.<br />Bottom line:  Their image was cliched, but their songs rise above the cliches.
B00006G8G1|5.0|As much as I loved the CD version of \\"Rock in Rio\\", seeing its DVD counterpart increased my appreciation tenfold.  If you think Maiden are too old to rock...you are wrong.<br />The concert is energetic and electrifying.  When \\"The Wicker Man\\" first got started, I was a bit worried, because the way the camera angle kept shifting, I was afraid that would ruin it, but either they didn't do it very much throughout the whole thing, or I just didn't notice it after a while, but either way, it wasn't a problem.  The camera angles provide multilple views of each musician, so you can see how they create this incredible music. The guitarists were especially interesting to watch.  It's official, Janick Gers is awesome.  He's a better guitarist than Adrian, and almost as good as Dave, and he's definitely got the best stage presence of all of them (in fact, Adrian's kinda boring, odd man out I guess).  Nicko's energetic drumming is also interesting to watch, and then we have Bruce.  Wow.  Is this guy really 44 years old?  I'm less than half his age, and I'm not sure I have the energy to run around like he does. He barely stops moving throughout the whole thing!  Awesome stage presence, just a cool guy.<br />There are plenty of highlights to be found here, but a few moments do stick in my mind specifically.  \\"The Clansman\\" is an especially compelling live performance, complete with a cool acoustic bass intro, a stellar vocal performance, and you get to see Nicko and Bruce do goofy little dances. :)  Also, the part during \\"The Evil That Men Do\\", where Steve spars with Eddie is just hilarious, and it was cool to see what Bruce was talking about when he mentioned burning the virgins during \\"Iron Maiden\\" (it was a pyrotechnic thing).  But really, there's not a dull moment to be found here.<br />If you love Maiden, this is a definite must-have.  If you enjoyed the CD...you ain't heard nothing yet.<br />Up the Irons!!
B00005JKDR|5.0|The movie itself is one of the most entertaining animated films I've ever seen and I've seen more than my share. Excellent story, gorgeous CG, funny, touching and great for all ages. This is one of THE classics. Pixar=quality entertainment! But the DVD was even better than I anticipated. So many great extras like the the shorts &quot;Mike's New Car&quot; and &quot;For the Birds&quot; (both are hilarious). All the behind-the-scenes stuff is fantastic. And there are so many great easter eggs hidden on the DVD that you could spend quite some time hunting for those treasures (and they're definitely worth the time). This DVD would be a gem in anyone's collection!
0399226907|5.0|The Very Hungry Catepillar is a very good childrens book. It is about a catapillar that is very hungryand it eats alot of food including apples, cake and even ice cream.I think kids will like this book because it has a catepillar and a butterfly in it and young children like bugs. It has a meaning that says dont judge a person by the way they look. It also tells children that real beauty is in the inside. This story has many pictures and it has a differnt stye of page that i think children of ages 3-8 will love it. Personally I think it is a wonderful book. I gave the book 5 stars because I think it is a childrens book that is in the catogory of great books to teach a good thing to children. \\"The Very Hungry Catepillar\\" was writen an illistarted by Eric Carle
B00004S6GL|2.0|Elliott's previous effort, &quot;XO&quot;, is far superior and possibly my all-time favorite CD.  I can't describe my anticipation for &quot;Figure 8&quot; or my disappointment in the results, even after several listens.  I really hope he gets back to the &quot;XO&quot; or &quot;Either/Or&quot; sound, preferably the former.
B00006IU73|5.0|You know, I didn't think anything PT did would top &quot;Lightbulb Sun&quot; with &quot;Hate Song&quot; and &quot;Russia on Ice&quot; BUT &quot;In Absentia&quot; most assuredly does. Every time I listen, it's better and better. If you are looking for a sound that will blow your doors off, get this CD. From the opening grabber of &quot;Blackest Eyes&quot; to the nicely strange &quot;Gravity Eyelids&quot; to the hard sounds of &quot;Wedding Nails&quot;--this is one CD that will surpise you, surround you, capture you, and make you a believer...in Porcupine Tree. Bravo!
0786868694|5.0|Nigella's third book is a companion to her wonderful televison series \\"Nigella Bites\\". Divided into ten sections ranging from All-Day Breakfast to Temple Food, the recipes in this beautiful book are as fabulous and irresistible as Ms. Lawson herself. With gorgeous photography of food, the introductions to the recipes are pretty much taken from the show and almost quoted verbatim, so for those who haven't had the luxury of seeing \\"Nigella Bites\\", you're getting the gist of what makes the TV show wonderful right on the printed page just by reading this book. I think what's excellent about Nigella is that anyone can make her food, and it's divine food, unpretentious yet very gourmet, for lack of a better word. There is no fussing about ingredients, e.g., like one requiring white truffle oil or some other expensive ingredient that you'll only need a teaspoon of, to make something that once seemed intimidating. Her Lemon Risotto is unmatched, and the Chocolate Cloud Cake is heavenly. I could go on and on... And who'd have thunk about deep-frying candy bars, hmmm? Nigella's ice cream recipe needs no ice cream maker. And the Ham in Coca Cola is a MUST! And I whole-heartedly agree with the reviewer from Everett, WA about the 24-hour roast shoulder of pork. Nigella Lawson has redefined my love for being in the kitchen, and her mantra is that the kitchen is a place that you escape to, not from, a mantra that I adhere to. Even if you're not one for cooking, I urge anyone to get this book, if not for the recipes, but for the photos and the inexplicable stress-relieving tone of this volume.
0385484518|1.0|This book was given to me as a \\"must read\\".  After reading it, however, I would re-classify it as a \\"must trash\\".  The author presents Morrie as a kind, caring, older gentlemen with lots to give in terms of life's lessons.  As an interesting aside, during one part of the book, Morrie and the author discuss their mutual hatred of lawyers.  I find it interesting that the author and Morrie make such hasty generalizations about the legal profession.  Indeed, most lawyers I know are honorable men and woman trying their best to do their jobs carefully and compassionately.  These jobs include representing battered women in court, prosecuting child molesters and assisting children through child welfare actions - to name a few.  I can certainly see why Morrie would choose to hate people like this.  Grotesque sarcasm aside, normally after a book I feel empty and hurt when a main beloved character passes away, regardless of the character's fictional or non-fictional status.  Take T.S. Garp's demise in Irving's \\"The World According to Garp\\" for example.  When Morrie died, on the other hand, the world lost someone whose life's lessons should never have been committed to paper.  In short, the world had become a better place.
0375414053|5.0|What a terrific book!  I've shamelessly stolen time and left other \\"must do\\" tasks to fend for themselves while I devoured this very smart, very funny, and piercingly accurate book. <br />I've read chunks of this book to my husband, to friends, and e-mailed selected tidbits to my sister.  It's that good.  ...Kate Reddy doesn't whine; she articulates, with wit and perception, what's so unspeakably tough about the shoes she's walking in.  Even if they're fudge-colored pencil heels worn with an Armani suit as corporate armor!
B00005A46T|4.0|Having heard all of the songs from Iowa i must say its nothing like the one before it. The self titled Slipknot cd had very stupid lyrics. \\"The stone of leaves\\" cmon what the hell does that mean. In Iowa the lyrics were a little more real but it screams death and is so unpatriotic u wont believe what they say. Nevertheless i like it but u may think im sick and im ok with that.
6304806442|5.0|I have seen this movie four or five times and notice something new each time(i.e. the Hibernian poster in his room.) Definitely a heavy, anguish laden story but very well crafted.  Not the movie to watch if you are in the mood for light comedy. The vignette ending with Mark Renton's voiceover narration is magnificent and ingenius.
B00003CWL6|1.0|I did not enjoy this movie at all. The acting was bad, the characters one-dimensional and the central message (that American suburbia is not the paradise it appears to be on the surface) was also not news to me. And some of the plot developments, especially towards the end of the movie, were desperately contrived, especially the ex-Marine officer turning out to be a closet homosexual.<br />I was particularly disappointed with the performances by Kevin Spacey (his worst I have seen) and Anette Bening, who was so good in Grifters. Admittedly the two younger actors who portrayed their daughter and her love interest were extremely good, and did not fall into the trap of over-acting like their two better-known colleagues.<br />I cannot understand how this movie won the critical acclaim it did.
0141301155|5.0|I thought the book was cool to think that this boy could have won a ticket when he was so poor and everyone else was rich.<br />I think it was an awesome book - that's why I give it 5 stars
B00003CXI1|4.0|When it comes to Harry Potter, I have mixed feelings.  The books are very entertaining, but they are also pretty silly, and can't hold a candle to the brilliant works of such writers as Tolkien, CS Lewis, E Nesbit, and such others.  Harry Potter deserves five stars for entertainment value, but one star for innovation and sophistication.  So why is the movie so much better?  Well, movies don't always have to be taken as seriously as books do.  Not only that, but it is extremely entertaining without having to deal with childish narrative or the fact that there are a billion fantasy stories like this.  Harry Potter is just a fun movie, and while I only recommend the books for those who need a break from Dostoyevsky and Victor Hugo (and certainly, we all need a break from serious books now and then), this movie has something for everybody, and can be watched anytime.  I would have given this 4.5 stars, but i can't, and it definitely doesn't deserve the five stars i would give a more serious movie, so four will have to do.  Peace!
6304240554|5.0|This movie is a man's worst nightmare. It touch you deep inside and doesn't let you go. Overall: EXCELLENT.
B00005YXZH|2.0|Wilco was on its way (after A.M. and Being There) to becoming one of the best rock/roots rock bands in the world.  They took a diversion with Billy Bragg down Mermaid Ave. to do justice to many pieces of Guthrie poetry by setting them to music...fine.  They made a pretty pop record (Summerteeth)...okay.  But this...well, the album itself is not without merit, but Tweedy and co. have gotten to the point where they're quirky for the sake of being quirky.  Many of these tunes have potential, but get too caught up in being cute, and \\"experimental,\\" and...whatever.  There's nothing, musically, on this disc that hasn't been done before.  It all comes off as trite, self-aggrandizing, avant-look-at-me, condescending rubbish.  Wilco's considerable talents would be best spent elsewhere...
B000069CWE|3.0|A friend of mine bought &quot;Reanimation&quot; and after listening to it a couple of times I like it a little better than I did the first time I heard it.  But like in most cases, the original is much much better than the remix.  I'd like this cd as a gift, but I wouldn't buy it.
0671045865|4.0|I have. It was only for a few hours, in a dark forest, burned by a recent fire. The terror was immeasurable against anything I've ever felt in my life. I thought I would never find my way back to humans. It was only for a few hours, though. And I was in my early 20s. Imagine the fear of a child. Imagine it.<br />This story made my heart pound with fear. It will make yours do the same.
0679735909|2.0|This book was so BORING! Don't get me wrong! I love literature, especially historical literature. I love British authors. I love stuffy, scholarly stuff. But my goodness! Boring from page one.<BR>I tried so hard to like this story, especially since they made it into a movie and its got such good reviews here. And the storyline itself is good. Maybe its writing style or something.<BR>But I got about half way and gave up. The story as far as I got was about a loser grad student who may eventually fall in love with this feminist over a bunch of letters he found about his idol. His idol is boring, too. I just couldn't strum up interest in an illicit affair between a married man and a fairy tale writer. So? I didn't care for the characters, \\"historical\\" or otherwise. I guess I'll wait for the movie to come out. I hope its not as 'long' as the book. I just want people to be forewarned that its not what they expect. Its not an easy flowing, cushy romance. Its stilted and long winded and rambling, this story. But try it! You may feel differently.<BR>I'm just sorry I missed out on whatever everybody else seemed to get from this???....
B00006879E|5.0|This album is amazing!! I honestly haven't taken it out of my cd player for months.  I know that the point of these reviews is to give potential buyers an insight on how the music sounds like by comparing it to other bands, but it simply isn't fair to do that with Maroon5.  People try to label Maroon5's music as sounding like Jamiroqui or by saying that it is R &amp; B infused with rock, etc...but don't listen to them.  Maroon5 is brilliant rock and roll pure and simple.  People need to accept that and stop labelling it.  In 1998, when I was a senior in high school in Los Angeles, I was in a band and we played with Kara's Flowers (Maroon5's previous name).  I found their music to be charming as it sounded sort like a very poppy Greenday, but charm can only take you so far and Maroon5 music is very deep and very addicting.  Trust me when I tell you to BUY THIS ALBUM.  You may not connect with it at first, but listen to it a few times and I guarantee you'll be hooked.  Songs that I thought I would grow bored of, I find myself finding a new perspective on and hearing new words and sounds that keep me interested.  I'm starting to ramble, but in conclusion, buy the CD and support a truly gifted band.
B000002BPS|5.0|I'll be honest. The Offspring is one of my favorite bands despite there tendency to produce sub par cd's. Not the case here. There's just something about that melodic punk  soft core metal sound combined with pessimistic yet somehow reasuring and insightful lyrics that sounds good to my ears. It seems that compared to today's other punk offerings such as Green Day and Blink 182 the Offspring just sound better. Instead of trying to conform with popular culture or venture away from it the Offspring just kind of mix all different forms of popular rock music together to form a interesting yet supprisingly hip sound. \\"The Meaning of Life\\" is a great pure song filled with smart lyrics and and a great beat. \\"Gone Away\\" is deeper than the other songs on the cd but is also delivers the best beat and the most thoughtful lyrics. \\"Cool to Hate\\" is an awesome song filled with amusingly pessimistic lyrics. \\"Mota\\" deals with drugs the offspring way childishly yet brilliantly. \\"Way Down the Line\\" is a cool song that deals with every teenagers worst fear becoming there parents. But by far the best song on the album is \\"I Choose\\" it has the best lyrics, beat, and overall appeal of any song on the cd. Ixnay On The Hombre is an awesome cd and is definitly in my top 20 cd's of all time. If you just want to buy an Offspring cd this is your best bet.
6305949980|5.0|When I finally got around to buy this DVD I had high expectations. I had not read detailled reviews of the film since I didn't want any spoilers. At first I was confused. This was not at all what I had expected. When I figured out that this is a Disney film, things made more sense. This is probably the best animated musical ever made! The music by Randy Elfman guides the story (watch &quot;The making of...&quot; and you know what I mean) in a way that few other films match. Excellent image quality and DTS sound makes this a reference disc for any home theater owner. Even if you don't have a big rig, just enjoy the fabulous story and music of Jack and his friends in Halloween Town.
B000056H24|5.0|Reading the other reviews I lost count how many of them referred to this movie as &quot;over-long&quot;.  Frankly, one of my professors calls this &quot;the McDonalds Mentality&quot;.  Most people today, and the vast majority of us under 40 are so used to getting everything in soundbites, in between commercials, snacks (especially fast food), cell phone calls, etc.  They don't have the patience to write a letter, cook a real meal, read a long book or savor a longer movie like George Stevens masterpiece &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;.  I wish the DVD contained the original cut of the film, 260 minutes, as well as the present 195 minute presentation.  The beggining of the film feels far to rushed.  The ending of the film, fortunately, is sublime and true to the Gospel accounts of these profound events.  A lifetime acheivment Academy Award is over-due for Max Von Sydow. Thanks for reading. CAL

Ds9 is no different, the federation vs the dominion, Sisco vs cardasians, even the new show \\"Enterprise\\" has \\"Archer\\" Vs. \\"Silik\\"  I believe that this common good vs. evil theme is what makes the show special, why DS9 is going to sell well, and why Enterprise will have at least 6 or 7 seasons I think, paramount would do well to consider a Ds9 big screen movie, and possibly a movie of \\"Enterprise\\" the prequel??
B00005AQGH|5.0|I think this is the most mysterious album not just of rap, but of all of time, If compare this album to the rest of pac's albums, you can see that none sound like this one, the music is totally different (For better) it is full of mysterious lyrics that fuel up the theories of him being alive, if you really pay attention to those lyrics you can't help but feel goosebumps, most of the producers (including Suge Knight) use Alias that they didn't use in other albums, and their production isn't their average production. You can see they didn't spend all the money in the desing of this album as they did in his prior project: all eyez on me, but it's still more creative than any other, and to me ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND is pac's most creative song, his ability to use metaphors and the song's structure isn't the standard that uses verse:chorus:verse:chorus, plus the feeling he puts to this song makes it to me his best song, and to sum it all up, the best MC in Rap History, The Best album in Rap history and the best song in Rap history, what more can you ask for. <br />Think that with all these industry snakes, you may never get such a true, creative and mysterious album ever again.
B00006HBUA|5.0|Scooby Doo was a great movie for people who grew up watching the cartoon.  The movie was jam packed with full out belly laughs.  The twist at the end was suprising and hillarious.  You just never know who you will see when they rip off the rubber mask.  This movie is geared more for adults who grew up watching Scooby Doo, than it is for today's kids.  It has some adult type humor but it is done in a subtle way that most children would not be able to pick up on.  \\"Scooby Doo is Like great!!\\"

B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park is revolutionizing today's rock genre.  Successfully blending rap, metal, rock, and techno into a musical &quot;hybrid&quot;, the band creates a sound that is all their own.  Chester Bennington (the lead singer) takes his vocal performance from smooth and melodic to growling intesity and back again within each song.  Accomanying him, Mike Shinoda (MC) blends his raps perfectly into the mix.  The lyrics are deep and metaphorical, deeling with real issues and inner conflicts, plus they are totally devoid of the cursing that has recently become nearly unavoidable for fans of rock music.  This band is not out to become trendy or to sell records.  They live for their fans and their music.  This band is groundbreaking, their sound is diverse, unique, highly memorable, and suprisingly refined for a debut album.  This is the only CD that I own that i can listen to not only once but several times through without getting tired of it.  It is simply amazing, this is the best band in years.  This is a must own!<br />Songs on this CD that you have likely heard on the radio:<BR>2. One Step Closer<BR>5. Crawling<BR>6. Runaway<BR>8. In the End<br />Songs on this CD that you may not have heard that are even better than the ones you probably have.<br />1.  Papercut<BR>3.  With You<BR>4.  Points of Authority<BR>9.

Many elements of the book are like a mirror of my own life as a working mom of nearly 11 years.  The book captures all the emotions of working mommy-hood:   anxiety, humor, love, joy, anger, despair.   A quick read that probably bears reading twice to appreciate the layers of the story.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|The extra quality and features on this DVD make it worth the wait for the 20th annivesary of the film to make it available in this format.  This is such a classic story and John Williams' soundtrack helps drive it -- so the music enhancements alone make it worth investing in this DVD.  The live performance of the soundtrack option is fantastic and a one-of-a-kind feature.  Throw in that it also includes the original E.T. release on Disc 2 (in simple Dolby Surround) and it's an even better deal.  I'd rate it a must buy for any John Williams soundtrack fan as well.

B000002UTI|5.0|I never truly appreciated the genius of John Lennon as a solo artist until I bought this CD.  This is a great introduction to Lennon's music, combining a number of true Beatles classics along with some amazing Lennon solo tracks.  The fact that several of the Beatles songs are not the group's more famous ones is an added plus.  The very familiar Twist and Shout and Help! are great, but these songs are only an oldies' station away most of the time.  The psychedelic Strawberry Fields Forever is great fun, the hard-riffing Revolution packs a punch, and Sgt. Pepper's A Day in the Life highlights Lennon's singular contribution to rock music.  I was most thrilled, however, to find A Day in the Life in this collection-it may not immediately come to mind when you think of Beatles classics, but I think it is the Fab Four's most poignant song.  The slow, sentimental sound of the White Album's Julia and the frenetic, catchy delivery of The Ballad of John and Yoko help set the stage for the Lennon solo tracks.  Naturally, the song Imagine is the highlight of Lennon's solo career, earning a short rehearsal track along with the original in this collection.  For me, Woman is the quintessential Lennon track, bursting with emotion and beauty.  Then there is the controversial God; I really like the song, especially Lennon's list of things and people he doesn't believe in (which includes \\"beatles\\"); the song certainly reflects Lennon's personal philosophy, and this will doubtless flavor some listeners' regard for the track.  The remaining songs were less familiar to me, but songs like Jealous Guy and (Just Like) Starting Over encompass the variety, genius, and easy listenability of this great artist's unique music.<br />This album offers the listener a great sampling of Lennon's entire discography.  Certainly, arguments can be made about songs that should or should not have been included, but this collection represents a noble and much-appreciated effort to keep alive the memory, music, and genius of an artist struck down much too soon.  Imagine what could have been, but enjoy and appreciate what was.sic, and genius of an artist struck down much too soon.  Imagine what could have been, but enjoy and appreciate what was.
0064431622|5.0|I think that \\"The Mixed-Up Chameleon\\" by Eric Carle is a really great, fun and interesting, and a great learning experience for children.  Personally, I have loved this book since as long as I can remember.  In the beginning, it describes a chameleon that is bored of its boring life.  He then goes to the zoo and sees all kinds of different and beautiful animals.  Astonished by the sight of all of them, he wishes to become them one by one.  He must wish to be about ten animals including a person.  After all of this excitement, he sees a fly and......  Well, I can't tell you what happens!  Buy this book and your child(children) and you can find out together.  <BR>This is the type of book that you can read and enjoy for years and years.  Although, if I had to lower it down to a certain age group, then,   I would have to say it's mostly for children from the ages 5-8.  But don't get me wrong, I'm defiantly not telling all of you that are older not to read this book.  <BR>For all of you parents out there:<BR>This book is a great choice for children that are in the learning process of reading.  It's easy to comprehend and there are not many words that will be stumbled on.  Also, it has a great lesson behind all of it.  You can wish to be something else, and if that wish comes true, then all it will tell you is that you were perfect the way you were before.  Wishing to be something else will just make things difficult in the long run.<BR>So after hearing all that I have to say do you think you'll be interested in buying a book like this?  Trust me, it will be worth the money and a great buy.<BR>Also, I just wanted to say that if you enjoy this book, then I  believe that you will enjoy every single one of Eric Carle's others.  He is an amazing author.
B00005JKLZ|3.0|As a fan of the original 1960 George Pal movie (starring Rod Taylor) of HG Wells 'The Time Machine' I very much looked forward to seeing this new version on the big screen. Directed by Simon Wells, great grandson of the famous novelist, it promised to be a more faithful recreation of his great grandfather's work but as I was to discover this latest version is actually based on the original movie screenplay and is a bit of a mixed bag.<br /> In this latest version, Guy Pearce (Memento, Ravenous, LA Confidential etc.), plays Alexander, an eccentric scientist in 1899, somewhat obsessed with the notion of time travel and pen pal of a certain Albert Einstein. When his beloved fianc&eacute;e Emma (Sienna Guillory) is senselessly murdered, unable to come to terms with her loss, Alexander devotes his life to inventing a time machine so that he can prevent the murder and be reunited with his lost love. Unfortunately however, although he succeeds in building said time machine (aesthetically constructed with lots of polished brass and glass), is he is unable to permanently alter the past. Emotionally devastated once more Alexander, in his anguish plunges forward in time in the hope of finding a better world, to a time where the surviving descendants of mankind have evolved into two separate species and where the timid race, called the Eloi, are hunted by the cannabalistic Morlocks who live underground.<br />There are definitely some good moments in this movie, and indeed much of the first half of the movie is very enjoyable. Guy Pearce is perfectly watchable and the sets and photography are very aesthetically pleasing. In particular, production designer Oliver Scholl has constructed some great sets and the time machine itself is a very impressive improvement on the 1960 Rod Taylor version. Some of the early Morlock scenes are also quite thrilling as they appear and dissapear from the ground, hunting and capturing their Eloi prey. However, there are also quite a few negatives, including an annoying and fairly pointless holographic librarian and a dire last fifteen minutes featuring (a clearly desperate for work) Jeremy Irons as some kind of &uuml;ber-Morlock that has apparently been rolled in flour. In the end, this is just an average movie and certainly no improvement on the original, making it a fairly pointless exercise for all concerned.ing an annoying and fairly pointless holographic librarian and a dire last fifteen minutes featuring (a clearly desperate for work) Jeremy Irons as some kind of über-Morlock that has apparently been rolled in flour.

B00005JKG5|4.0|This DVD version of Flashdance continues the missing scene scenario that I have noticed since I caught the movie on cable in the late 1980's.  In that earlier version there was a more complete interaction between Michael Nouri's character being amazed by Jennifer Beals' character removing her undergarments from beneath her sweatshirt when the two have returned to her apartment after her friend's ice-skating performance or lack thereof. As I recall, and I hope someone else remembers this too, MN's character says something about what she is doing as he gets up to leave, and questions whether she thinks she's being seductive or indifferent to his noticing her actions. Whatever he said and did at this point is an essential bridge to their starting their relationship; otherwise, it is just as we see it--she's sitting removing her bra, then next thing she's standing kissing him, then it's the next morning afterwards. Hello! What was the spark that got them to kiss in the first place?! That missing scene. And, of course, if that scene is missing, then what about others that are already long forgotten. For me, this DVD was long-awaited for the reason that I thought a DVD version of the movie would *have* to include this scene; it would be the *real* whole, complete movie immortalized and sanctified on the great replayable DVD format. Why else do we love buying our favorite movies this way? I want a refund! (or, maybe, a Director's Cut version? =)

0375805613|5.0|I personally loved reading the book The Monster at the end of this book.  My parents bought this for me went I was just very little. The book is about Grover from the show Sesame Street. Grover, being a wimp, is scared because he thinks the monster at the end of the book will hurt him. I loved the book because the book builds suspense throughout the book, as Grover gets more scared as the book goes on. In the book Grover actually tries telling you not to turn the pages.  He even tries funny things like tying pages together and building a brick wall to stop you from turning the page. All in all I thinks this is a great book for any one in elementary, maybe not so much as 4th or 5th. I recommend it because its funny and it goes to show you not to be afraid of all monsters.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I Loved this movie the first time I saw it. I admit that it is a little bit gory (OK, so a WHOLE BUNCH gory, but, hey!, that is one of the reasons I liked it. On peculiar thing I noticed was: in one of the battle scences, the score sounded a little too much like Mars, the bringer of war; from Gustav Holst's &quot;The Planets.&quot; Of course, that is just something that a music buff would notice, and anyway, it didn't take away from the movie, the composer was probably just learning a lesson from the master. GREAT movie though.
0792151712|4.0|How would you draw people into another re-telling of the sinking of the Titanic? Why, generate a fictional romance, of course, and that's just what director James Cameron did with this modern-day re-telling of the sinking of the great ship in the movie Titanic.<BR>At slightly over three hours in length, this movie is in itself titanic. Along with the re-telling of the tragedy of the loss of the ship and passengers, it weaves a fictional love story between two unlikely individuals: Jack Dawson, a starving artist, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, and a young, aristocratic, soon-to-be married female, Rose Dewitt Brubaker, played by Kate Winslet. Unlikely as the romance may seem, the two eventually find themselves in a passionate embrace in a car stored for shipment in the bowels of the ship.<BR>Like all great tragedies, this romance also ends, as Jack Dawson goes down with the ship, leaving Rose to pine for the rest of her life for a man she knew only briefly.<BR>This movie, a Twentieth Century Fox/Paramount release, is well worth a watch. I rated it four stars for good special effects, and very good acting by all cast-members. Although the release of this film was surrounded by much hype and a lot of the special effects methodology was well known before it's showing, it was still possible to allow oneself to be drawn in to the spectacle of a somewhat dramaticized account of what happened the night the Titanic went down. As well, the fictional romance adds a heart-rending touch, involving one in the story of love and loss set in the grand old &quot;gilded age&quot; days we will never see again.<BR>Now all we need is another movie about raising the Titanic. How about it, Mr. Cameron?
B00005JK8K|2.0|Windtalkers is suppose to be a epic war movie place in saipan island during WWII. Right from the get go the movie starts and lets you know the settings and whats its going to be like for the rest of the war parts. There guns and gear are very accurate, and some of the battle sections are pretty huge. As far as the reality of it all, its horrible, like it was edited for little kids. It doesn't feel like there in a real battle, and the over acting in the movie is heartless, no feeling comes from the actors. Its a very good idea, really badly done.

B00006JLX4|5.0|You get s+e, one of the best albums of the '90's, lots of b-sides, two peel sessions, and an entire concert, all this for the price of a normal cd, there's not a better deal out there.  I got this yesterday, and was very impresed with the second disc, the Water, Domestic ep is great and so are it's b-sides, the peel session songs aren't bad either, but the real gem here is the full live concert, it starts out excelent with one of my favorents, Conduit for Sale, the live version is far superior to the cd version, it's a shame they broke up and I never got to see them live, oh well, at least they released this concert, i guess it's the next best thing.  Anyways, to put it short, get this cd, even if you already have S+E, there's enough bonus material here to make it well worth your money.
B0000062Y2|5.0|First, this is not an album purely for people who believe in Jesus Christ, it has nothing to do with it.<br />It tells a story which some people may have found uninteresting, in a way which captures your imagination, plays with your emotions and begs you to become part of the entire musical.<br />The muscial arrangement is fabulous, the singers are terrific.  Ted Neeley (Jesus) has a superb range to his voice and makes you want to &quot;wail&quot; with him.  Carl Anderson (Judas) has soul seeping from him at every step.  Every other member of the cast are equally as brilliant.<br />For those people who have not seen the Motion Picture from which this was taken, you may not fully understand or appreciate the passion that is expressed by the characters.  The picture itself is a complete work of art.  I would and do have both the soundtrack and the picture.  Having seen the picture, the expressions that are portrayed by the characters are so easily felt by the listener, which makes the whole experience infinitely superior.<br />For the 70's music lovers the rhythm guitars and wah wah's are just tremendous.<br />This is an album which I could not be without.  A must for anyone who likes music. SERIOUSLY.

0385495315|4.0|\\"The Code Book:  The Evolution of Secrecy from Mary Queen of Scots to Quantum Cryptography\\" by Simon Singh is a wonderful book about the history of code-making and code-breaking.  What is most impressive about Singh is he is able to take the most complicated mathematical information (in my opinion) and explain it in layman's terms.  Another more suitable name for \\"The Code Book could be Code-Making and Code-Breaking for Dummies:  A Historical Perspective\\".  Singh covers the history of encryption, tracing its evolution throughout time and outlining the impact cryptography and cryptanalysis has had on the world.  World War II, the Enigma machine and how the fate of the world rested upon whether or not secret knowledge would fall into enemy hands, is discussed in great detail.  From Singh's perspective, it would seem that the outcome of all military battles could be pre-determined by who had employed better cryptanalysis, as the most powerful weapon, is secrecy.  Personally, what interested me most about \\"The Code Book\\"  is its discussion about the Navajo Code Talkers, hieroglyphics, Linear B, and quantum cryptography.  I also thoroughly enjoyed the author's humor and wit, ability to break things down so that a non-technological mind could grasp some of the most complicated of codes and his affinity for making the personalities who discovered the codes as well as the personalities who broke the codes, come to life.  I would highly recommend \\"The Code Book\\" to anyone who is interested in cryptography, cryptanalysis, security, telecommunications, math, science, history or simply a good read.

B000001EGE|5.0|Honky Chateau was the first album to finally contain an identifiable \\"sound\\" for Elton John.  Elton's previous albums meandered from country rock to gospel to symphonic to hard rock to pop...it was hard to tell just what type of music Elton was trying to sing.  However, with Honky Chateau Elton defined a style that was to be his, and which I think is still his style today, evolved with time and skill.<br />Another of Elton's albums that went to number 1 on the album charts, this one was filled with gems that set a new personal standard for Elton, and gave rock music that would one day be classics.<br />\\"Honky Cat\\" was infused with a bit of jazz and had a fast beat, and has some thematic similarity to \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\".  Similar to the latter song \\"Honky Cat\\" charted as a single, and began to establish Elton as a pop star.<br />\\"Rocket Man\\" is a pop ballad that is one of Elton's most requested songs, both in concert and on the radio.  Certainly one of the most memorable space songs, along with \\"Space Oddity\\" by David Bowie.  The nearly humorous lyrics (\\"...Mar ain't the kind of place to raise your kids...\\") belie the very serious nature of the song.<br />\\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters\\" is another mellow pop song, with beautiful harmonies.  Underappreciated though very well performed.<br />There is a lot of quality in the other songs.  \\"I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself\\" is ironic in that the song is about death, but the music maintains a fast tempo and sounds upbeat.  When I listen to this song I tend to ignore that the song is about suicide because the music just sounds so positive.<br />\\"Mellow\\" has moments of musical interest as the music breaks from the expected path and explores side paths.  Elton John tries to inject progressive elements into his music?<br />\\"Hercules\\" has been a sort of theme song for Elton himself.  During a 1975 concert in Denver Elton's band played Hercules for a very lengthy period of time as Elton walked around the stage and shook hands with as many fans as he could reach.  He calls himself Elton Hercules John, of course.  Rocking song that he seems to want to use to identify himself.<br />\\"Salvation\\" has the potential to be a gospel song, but it really doesn't sound very gospel.  \\"All the Nasties\\" from \\"Madman Across the Water\\" has a much stronger gospel sound, which was less strong than the previous \\"Border Song\\".  Elton has used gospel elements in a few songs, but as he progressed in his career the gospel elements became weaker and weaker.  On his next album, \\"Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player\\", the gospel element was essentially non-existent.<br />Every song on this CD is at least good, and range up to great.  The only song I had trouble with on this version was the hyper version of \\"Slave\\" added as a bonus track.

0446678430|2.0|I agree with the more negative reviews of this book. The writing is wordy/slow/redundant which makes the little information that is provided all the more frustrating. This thing could have been summed up by:<BR>1) Think about how the government taxes different types of income.<BR>2) Start a business.<BR>3) Buy investment real estate.<BR>The rest is just filler or misleading. Flip through it in a book store. Ignore any information on trading options etc etc. Options are a very complex instrument and other books are far far more useful than this little &quot;intro&quot; (come on R.K. do you really think Mr. and Mrs. Wanna Be are going to start trading options with that little bit of information ? Dangerous at best)<BR> Better yet buy &quot;Fooled by randomness&quot; for a reality check on investment concepts. <BR>I would have given the book one star if it did not make the reader feel a little &quot;better&quot;. So one star for content and one for &quot;feel good&quot;.<br />Save your money .....better yet save your time. The original Rich dad/poor dad book is pretty good. The rest Rich dad/Poor dad are permutations on the same theme.
0316666343|3.0|This book didn't live up to my high expectations.  I admire the author greatly for writing it, I have never read a book quite like it, I really did feel mired down in the family's great unhappiness.  However the characters didn't really come alive for me.  The book is part mystery, part fantasy, part fly on the wall drama of a family falling apart.  I felt very compelled to read on for the first third of the book but after that I felt that the story started to unravel somewhat.  I would recommend it to people who have read a lot of books and want to read something quite original.

Most of the hits are here but the inclusion of You'll See/You Must Love Me instead of Don't Cry For Me Argentina for it represented another facade of Madonna that was taking shape from 95 onwards.<br /><br />Well, this lady has done verything and anything in the books. Like what she famously said:&quot;Absolutely No Regrets!&quot;
1574535366|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  In fact, have already bought the other books in the series (Ender Shadow was excellent too).  The audio version has multiple readers, really helps with the many charecters.  Great for yourself or a family car-trip!
B00006690G|5.0|There aint no dissin now bout eminems new disk! He has put all the haters to rest with this one. Everyone just thought he was another one hit wonder but after his three tight albums there's no thinkin that anymore. The Eminem Show has gots to be his greatest. He raps bout issues like Bin Laden, drug use, and even lets his mind flow bout the dealings with his wife! Scratch that! Ex wife. The best has gotta be \\"My Dad's gone Crazy\\", the track with his daughter on it. Who says he ain't a loving father? Anyhows, you gotta peep this cd if you havent!
B00005JKWJ|4.0|I thought Blade 2 was well rounded..picked up where the first left off.The 2nd adds even more visual brillience then the first.<BR>there is some of the old school effects brought back from the first..but hey when you have a good thing going why not use it!<BR>Overall if you enjoyed the first blade,I believe you will enjoy the 2nd just as much..if not more!
0316666343|3.0|it didn't blow me away or anything......I just felt it was very unsatisfying when I was done with it, but I would never discourage anyone from reading it....I think Sebold does a great job at developing her characters and showing how everyone copes with their grief in different ways.
B000066NW0|3.0|I think that Avril is a nice transition from super sexy to more..mom friendly maybe? I still think he music style is much like one of a pop package. I mean, theres a huge population of pop princess haters....and what better way to take advantage of it, while still holding the pop...moneymaking almost type \\"aura.\\" So while i disagree when people say this is the antibritney (I think its simply an typical pop princess type move, but it feeds off of girls fed up with that whole deal)<br />Its a bit frustrating to most punk music fans. This brings herds of girls wanting to have this punk edge/skater thing, and since punk is often (as i see it)  prided on being original..this doesnt please many people. <br />While I myself am not a fan...I think that other than her radio superplaying two singles...this cd isnt too bad. Not my style, but not crap either.
B000002U8I|3.0|This album by tina was the one that put her back on track in the early '80's, and it got her back on the music map for good!<BR>This cd boasts a grammy winner and chart topper, WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT, the mark knopfler's written titletrack PRIVATE DANCER and the club hit LET'S STAY TOGETHER.<BR>There is no mistake, Tina WAS the female rockstar the music world was in need...and she proved that charisma got nothing to do with age.<BR>This is a perfect rock production, i reccomend it to anyone in search of raw thrills!
B000008GAC|5.0|First off I wanna say this is more than likely my favorite album of all time. If not this, then UYI 1 or 2 (AFD is the first GnR CD I bought, and made me take a chance on all their CD's). But this one because of the energy, and its a great party album too. The guitar work Slash has put forth on this album is untouchable, and no one will ever compare on any one single album (especially seeing as how it isnt even a Greatest Hits). All 12 tracks on this CD are incredible! You got your love songs like Sweet Child O Mine, and I Think About You, party tunes like Welcome to the Jungle and Paradise City, and chillin tunes like Rocket Queen. I assure you you will be tappin your foot and tryin to sing like Axl while playin your good ol' air guitar ;) A definte must buy for anyone with an ear for talent! Let me just say, if you HAVENT heard this CD, buy the un-edited version (it just aint GnR without obscenity)!
6304806434|4.0|The movie \\"Con Air\\" is definitely worth your time. But that horrendous song at the end ruins everything. Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) has ended his parole and he's going to fly back to his wife and daughter. The plane is full of the country's most notorious criminals and of course they seize the plane. Cyrus the Virus (John Malkovich) asked the stewardess what the in-flight movie was going to be and whined like a little girl when the madness broke out. \\"Funny fool, ain't you?\\" Snicker. Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames), Johnny 23 (Danny Trejo) and a psycho (Steve Buscemi) are also on the plane. The plane eventually crashes in Las Vegas and only one inmate gets lucky. The psycho looked sick according to a little girl. Cameron Poe's accent was borderline ridiculous, and John Cusack destroyed a nice car. Destruction and mayhem all rolled in one.
0792110188|5.0|It may not have the stature--critically or in the popular mind--of the films the Duke made in his prime, like &quot;Stagecoach,&quot; &quot;The Searchers,&quot; or the Cavalry Trilogy, but this boisterous Western clearly shows why Wayne got away for so long with &quot;playing himself.&quot;  He and co-star Mitchum bring to the screen, if not the limber bodies of their youth, a presence and experience (between them they had more than six decades in film by the time they made this one) that we seldom see in today's stars.  Very sensibly, they both play men of experience who are now slowing down a bit and beginning to think about the future they may not have anticipated having: Mitchum, as Sheriff JP Harrah, has settled down, and Wayne, as Cole Thornton, is picking his fights with care.  Familiar faces abound in the supporting cast, and there's a nice mix of action, humor, and outstanding characters (Christopher George as villain Nelse McCloud is one of the samples of that species you &quot;love to hate&quot;).  There's even a hint of romance, not only in the quirky relationship between James Caan as &quot;Mississippi&quot; Trehearne and Michele Carey as Joey MacDonald, but in the long history between Cole and saloonowner Maudie (Charlene Holt).  I couldn't begin to guess how many times I've rewatched this movie, and I still enjoy it just as much.
0790730960|5.0|Batman (Michael Keaton) is back, sort of. In &quot;Batman Returns,&quot; the Caped Crusader hardly makes an appearance in this sequel. Oswald Cobblepot a.k.a. &quot;The Penguin&quot; (Danny DeVito) likes to live in the sewers with the penguins and eat raw fish. What kind of a person is this? After saving the mayor's son from an insane clown, he gains popularity from Gotham City and they pity him. Selena Kyle a.k.a. &quot;The Catwoman&quot; likes to slice and dice muggers in the street and play with her whip... They join forces to get rid of Batman, but he spoils the fun. This movie was disgusting. Penguin likes to eat and eat and eat. Even Catwoman put a bird in her mouth. Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) ate cold soup and said it was cold. What's with the food in this movie? Christopher Walken's hair is genius like Albert Einstein. This is a good sequel directed by Tim Burton.
0440237688|4.0|First, when I read this book, I thought it is very hard even if it is for 6, 8, 10 grade students. Actually I don't know when it is written. But I am sure it criticizes the communism. Who knew communism's last as USSR or eastern European countries. But the auther understood the societies of communism. Their closed society and equal lives, but generation and generation, they can not know the origin community. Why should they work? communism's dream is very ideally. But it prevents diversity and creation of the people. Although human is social animals, communism ignores human's big principal. I don't like such a book because its background and result are very gloomy. But it express the communism very well. It should be ok that you read once or twice.
079213690X|5.0|Starred in and directed by Mel Gibson, this epic movie is based on the gruesome events that took place when Scotland decided to resort to fighting to gain its freedom from the ruling fist of England, \\"Braveheart\\" is one of those movies that has it all.  If you want romance, laughter, drama, action, or death, it's all here.  From loves first, innocent kiss to the final blood curdling screams that escape the lips of the dying as the last threads of life part from their limp twisted bodies, this movie will draw you into the action making you feel as if you're witnessing it all first hand.<BR> Mel Gibson gives what I consider to be his best performance in his role as William Wallace, a man hell bent on avenging the death of his true love.  In the process of seeking his own revenge Wallace rallies the people of Scotland and leads them into battle after battle against the English army, making a name for himself, and showing England that Scotland is a serious threat and will not be bought by false promises of land and money. <BR> The battle scenes in this movie are superb, making it well worthy to be a \\"man's movie\\", but the romantic, noble side of William Wallace, makes this a sweet love story, guaranteed to bring a tear to the eye of anyone with half a heart.  I for one will openly admit that I shed tears for the noble purpose that captured my attention, fulfilled my need for gore, and then immediately enthralled my mind.
B0000640VO|5.0|I absolutely adore this movie. I had heard rumors that it was 'weird' and 'too fantasy like' but, really, honestly, I have no idea where people came up with this. This movie is adorable and uplifting. Amelie is a great character, and her schemes are hilarious.<br />The thing I liked most about this movie was that the colors in it are so vivid and saturated that it's hard to keep your eyes off it. The colors and the set, mixed with the brilliant cinematography, make this movie a real pleasure to watch.<br />I swear this movie will make you ten times happier than you are right now. Go watch it, and fall in love!
0553573403|5.0|This book was passed on to me, and I have passed it on to 4 other people when I had finished it.  This is the best fantasy novel I have read in a very long time. The reason it is so good is the vividness of the characters.  It is a little slow to develop for the first one or two chapters, but then it sucks you in like a whirlwind, wrings the deepest emotional responses from you and leaves you craving more...remind you of the Lord of the Rings.  In this respect, it is very much like LOTR, although the story line and the landscape are completely different.  The book my sister gave me is just about done, it has been read so many times by so many people.  That is why I'm buying another one; so it can be passed to even more fantasy fans. Read it! You'll be glad you did.  Well done George R.R. Martin!  Please keep the books coming, but don't grind them out because your fans are so anxious for more.  They need to be just as good as the first three.
6302038308|5.0|MAJOR SPOILERS, but clarifications:<br />The first 15 minutes of Evil Dead 2 are a quick recap (with slightly different details) of the events of Evil Dead 1.  The original Evil Dead are the events of going to the cabin, all 5 teenagers included.  It is a longer version of the 1st 15 mins of Evil Dead 2.   After Ash gets chased out of the house (end of part 1 and end of 1st 15 mins of part 2) the sequal begins.   Brand new material on the next day after the events of Evil Dead 1.   The writing is brilliant.   Great movies.  :)<br />So if you wanted to watch the complete tale (like you would with the Star Wars Trilogy) watch Evil Dead 1.   The end of Evil Dead 1 could be treated as an intermission for the viewer.   Then put in Evil Dead 2 and fast-forward to where Ash runs out of the house (you'll notice it to be the exact same screen-shot as the end of part 1).   Watch from that point on (right where ash gets tossed back through forest, hits tree, etc.).  :)
0871137380|3.0|When I think of modern war novels, I think of life or death struggles that present the grim spectacle that armed conflict has become. The story should flow well to keep it gripping-if necessary, at the expense of reality, best demonstrated in Tim O'Brien's The Things They Carried. <br />When I think of nonfiction, I think of something informative but ultimately sterile. Names, dates, places, and ages must all be documented and included for a sense of thoroughness. A good flow is important, but Fact is King <br />These standards are the chief cause for disappointment when reading Mark Bowden's Black Hawk Down. Although it's jacket and subject matter appear to be the stuff of a novel, Bowden has opted to work in the nonfiction medium and build thrills from within that framework. <br />This leads to a book that, although clearly well researched and thought out, lacks the punch of fiction. At times, facts seem thrown in; a soldier may think back onto what his family might be doing, and for the sake of completeness we learn where he lives and his sibling's ages. Sure, it's good to know, but it just doesn't flow as well as it would otherwise. <br />Essentially, however, Black Hawk Down has no real flaws that are not caused by it's own genre. Anyone that likes non-fiction thrills should enjoy it, despite a somewhat sterile view. However, those that are looking for more style and less substance are best advised to seek other works.
B00006AL1G|4.0|I heard a lot of people who are actually into the culture (like me) are disappointed by the film.  Yes it omits alot of the really great DJs of the past and present, but what did you expect from a movie geared to the uninitiated?  On the commentary track, the director and producer both say &quot;if you want more of the history you should definitely check out WILD STYLE and...John Carluccio's BATTLESOUNDS.&quot;  What their really saying is, &quot;look if you're a part of this movement, we're sorry this movie is for old people who don't get it, go back to the movies that truly represent your culture.&quot;<br />I hold nothing against Doug Pray for making this movie, I think that for an outsider, he got as close as anyone could without getting the old, mostly white people completely lost.  If that had happened, the film would have never been released--period.<BR>I was really happy to see MOST of the legends on real film (and not shotty video like all my other DJ tapes) but yes, it is still inferior to Battlesounds.<br />Maybe when that DVD is released (I heard it should happen soon) we can direct all who enjoyed this movie to the authentic piece.<br />Until then, IF YOU STEP UP YOU GET HURT!! (that was dope)
B00005QIPH|5.0|The Strokes are honestly the best rock band that I know of right now. Here's a rundown: (rating out of possible 5 stars)<BR>Is This It? - Yes, this is it. ****<BR>The Modern Age - This is the slow version, if you want the upbeat version checkout the Modern Age EP. ****<BR>Soma - They played this song on The Conan O'Brien show not too long ago, and it rocked. *****<BR>Barely Legal - Longest Strokes song I've heard and it's not even 4 minutes. ****<BR>Someday - The video rocks. It has footage of them at a bar, practice sessions, and on Family Feud. ****<BR>Alone Together - This song has my favorite part on the whole record, where it goes: \\"Looking down sometimes felt nice,\\" while the music suddenly fades out and in comes the outro *****<BR>Last Nite - Best song I've heard in a long while. The better version is on the Modern Age EP though. The video has Albert knocking stuff over and Julian getting drunk. *****<BR>Hard To Explain - This song really grows on you, especially the chorus. *****<BR>When It Started - Only average song on the album. ***<BR>Trying Your Luck - They slow it down a little bit here, the live version on the Hard To Explain single is way better. In the live version, it feels like Albert's playing the guitar right next to your ear. ****<BR>Take It or Leave It - I'll take it. *****...
038533558X|4.0|Harlan Coben showcases many of his dazzling strengths in \\"Gone for Good.\\"  Dead-on dialogues,  tenderness that never turns mawkish, quick cuts, oddball characters and parental love are all displayed in abundance in this whirlwind thriller.<br />Will is a dubious sleuth.  He is naïve, credulous, and not the bravest boy on the planet.  Fortunately for him, his best friend, a former neo-Nazi who has blossomed into a fantastically successful yoga master, partners him.  The FBI (rough, tough and mean in this outing), plus two deadly high school friends of Ken quickly take an interest in his search.  It seems Will's fiancée had some connection with brother Ken, but what we do not know.  After three chilling murders, a few walks on the wild side, every piece of knowledge Will acquires is designed to throw him in deeper confusion despair.<br />In a sense, Mr. Coban does not play fair with the reader.  We need more character development to accept some of his incredible turnarounds as to why who is doing what.  To say I was surprised  at the final scene would be an understatement; I was astonished!  Unlike some writers, the author attempts to tie up the loose ends.  However, a few of his major characters were left in the land of surmise.
B000002H33|5.0|With hundreds already on this site, one more raving Master of Puppets review seems a bit redundant, but I'm gonna do it anyway. 16 years later, this is still the best metal album their is. Iced  Earth has stolen the crown of metal for the 90's, but they've still never written anything quite as good as this.(though don't take my word for it; buy everything they've written. Right now!) Metallica was unquestionably the best thrash band, and frankly, nothing written by the 3 other major thrash bands is even in the same league. Some people have claimed Peace Sells... by Megadeth is better than this. These people are psychotics.(Megadeth isn't even close to Metallica, ever, and Peace Sells isn't even their best album. Rust In Peace is better) Peace Sells... is a great album, but \\"Good Mourning/Black Friday\\" is the only song that is even in the same league as every song on Puppets. Hetfield's vocals and lyrics are much, much better than Mustaine's.(Someone tried to claim that Mustaine's vocals are more meaningful. Yeah. Whatever. Wake Up Dead, Bad Omen, Black Friday and Devils Island are all, ummm, brilliant, and oozing with insight.) Someone also claimed that Mustaine wrote some of the riffs for this album. Look at the liner notes. He doesn't get a single writing credit. I know this is supposed to be a review, not a comparison, but the poor reviews are all too infuriating to ignore.<br />But, anyway, enough of that. The only real complaint about this album is the way the vocals are recorded. They sounded better on Lightning, and better on Justice 2 years later. The general sound quality isn't great, but thats just standard for cds from this era.<br />This album is as consistent as they get. Metallica's albums were all very consistent in the 80's,(though the 90's are still good, but nowhere near as good.) but this is the only one with out a single noticably weaker track. Ulrich's drumming has improved a lot since the earlier albums, though he's still no Lombardo or Benante.  Hetfield's rhythm guitar simply destroys. I don't care if other people are more technical,(though he sure as hell isn't an amateur) his riffs are just brilliant. The main riff to every song is incredible.  The same goes for Hammet's solos. The only part of the music no one tries to dispute is the brilliance of Burton's bass. You can't always hear it too well, but when you can it's spectacular, particularly on Orion.<br />Though this is definitely thrash metal, this album extends the forays into slower tempos that they started on Lightning, though this album is arguably heavier overall.(though nothing here is quite as heavier as Fight Fire With Fire) Therefore, though this is unquestionably the best thrash album, it isn't the quintessential thrash album.(Kill 'Em All is. This album is really prog-thrash) As is almost always the case, expansion of sounds improves the album greatly. It's got plenty of pure thrash, specifically Batter, Disposable Heroes and Damage Inc.( Some people say Peace Sells... is heavier than this. Bullcrap. The aforementioned songs CRUSH anything on Peace Sells) Welcome Home is their second and prog-thrash ballad, and is the best song on the album, and probably my favorite Metallica song. The soloing, particularly the harmonized ones are just brilliant. The Thing That Should Not Be and Leper Messiah are the two slower, straight metal songs. They are arguably the slightly weaker songs on the album, but they still rock hard. Master of Puppets is the most progressive song here, with a stunning instrumental section in the beginning, and another brilliant main riff.(The laughing at the end is a bit cheesy, but it's a small problem.) Orion is the instrumental, with perhaps the best soloing of any Metallica song, and a really cool introduction.<br />In short, everything here is great, and this album really explores pretty much everything that thrash metal has to offer. BUY BUY BUY!!.  Hetfield's rhythm guitar simply destroys. I don't care if other people are more technical,(though he sure as hell isn't an amateur) his riffs are just brilliant.

B00006G8LB|5.0|...Spider-Man is a much better movie than any of Batman, Superman or X-men. This movie actually makes you care for its characters, something which was largely missing in those other three movies. Sometimes, the movie is so emotionally involving that it's almost as if it ISN'T a comic-book movie. This movie isn't about some grand world statement between good and evil, like in X-men. It isn't about show-off villians hamming it up, like in the Batman series. And it isn't even necessarily about making you believe a superhero can swing or fly, like in Superman. It's about the man behind the mask, the awkward Peter Parker, played perfectly by Tobey McGuire. His director, Sam Raimi, also deserves some applause for playing this movie so straight. It's so sincere and genuine, it's almost as if Capra directed it. CGI and chorographed action sequences eventually age and look lame after some time, but good character development and emotional involvement is timeless. Which is what makes this the best comic-book movie ever.
0345413377|1.0|Let me start by saying I am a liberal Christian. I'm a firm believer in gay rights, adamantly pro-choice, and think that many of America's leaders who claim to be diligent Christians are nothing but a bunch of old white guys in cheap suits waving flags saying that patriotism is the way to salvation. What's more, I even liked the first book of this series. By the third, however, it got to be too much.<br />The lengths to which the Christians in this book go to are sickening. We have a priest who goes through a process of redemption strong enough to justify his murder of a little girl. The whole Christian organization (which pretty much rules every aspect of life) is a corrupt, power hungry autocracy. Moreover, needlessly offensive comments are made about Christianity's virtues (for expample, the Spanish priest's idea that he would convert the mulefa from their satanic use of wheels, what the hell kind of Christian would do that?)that are downright agregious. It's obvious Philip Pullman is making these judgements due to his own ignorance.<br />These aren't the only things that make the book bad. The whole thing is utterly humorless. Also, it seems like Pullman has given up on development altogether and resorted to introducing a bunch of new gimmicks and creatures. Worst of all, the book ends on a sappy cliche of one of the most overused themes of all time.<br />Don't waste your time. Read some intelligent sci-fi by Anthony Burgess or Frank Herbert.
0679746048|5.0|I really enjoyed \\"Girl Interrupted\\". I thought it was very cute in the way that each chapter described a person or time in the hospital. Despite that she was mentally ill, she was able to put humor into her story. I read this in one day because its just one of those great books that you don't want to put down. I did really like this book & it was deserving of 5 stars, I would recommend it.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|Disney has often followed on a set of \\"guidelines\\" to making all of their films work: a beautiful princess in some kind of peril (ie: Sleeping Beauty is under a spell to make her sleep, Snow White ate the poisoned apple, Cinderella wants to go the ball, etc.). These films often work on some level, but originality is often lacking in fairy tales, which always come from some source. Plus, they teach lessons that don't exactly behoove the viewer, often the impressionable young child (lessons in infatuation--what fairy tale didn't have some prince with a superiority complex wanting to be king, and spotting a beautiful girl from across the room, and saying \\"She's the one.\\"???? You NEVER see Prince Wonderful courting Lovely Lady around, do you? Ok, ok, I'll get off my soapbox now. \\"Shrek\\" completely goes against the grain in terms of fairy tale concepts by adding a whole new twist to the genre, and the result is nothing short of spectacular.<br />Shrek (voice of Mike Myers) is an ugly green ogre living in a ramshackle house in the swamp by himself, without a care in the world. When Lord Farquaad (voice of John Lithgow) banishes all \\"fairy tale creatures\\" from the land, Donkey (voice of Eddie Murphy), who talks too much, escapes from his owner and the clutches of the people who are taking him away, and goes to Shrek's swamp and begs Shrek to take him in, and Shrek unwillingly does just that. When all the fairy tale creatures are dumped on his property, Shrek complains to Farquaad. Farquaad, a diminuitive lord with a superiority complex, wants to be king, and after consulting his magic mirror, he sees the woman he would like to have for his bride, and tells Shrek that he will remove the fairy tale creatures from his property if Shrek can bring him his future bride, Princess Fiona (voice of Cameron Diaz).<br />This movie is probably one of the funniest animated movies I've seen in a long time. I'm a Disney fan, but I've strayed from their \\"fairy tale\\" pictures due to a lackof interest, and have geared my interest to different (and original) animated stories. This one is truly original in every way, even though it recycles familiar fairy tale characters (the 7 dwarfs, Pinochio, Cinderella, Snow White, Little Red Riding Hood, etc), but in a humorous way. The actors themselves (Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow) are great in their parts, and the supporting voices and characters are what makes this film great. There are so many inside jokes that this movie would tend to fly right over a child's head. there are also alot of sight gags that the viewer would easily miss the first time around.<br />I don't have one absolute favorite scene, because this whole movie was hysterically funny and smart. However, some of them stand out in mind. The \\"gingerbread man\\" was classic, with the famous cookie lying on a cookie pan, legs broken off, with a glass of milk next to him. His \\"tourture\\" was getting dipped in the milk and the threat of his buttons getting ripped off. When Farquaad tells him to confess, Gingerbread Man screams \\"Eat me!\\" and spits. Another great scene was the \\"Merry Men\\" singing their song, which turns into the suspended-motion scene from \\"The Matrix\\" with Fiona lifting into the air in the \\"karate-kick\\" motion, the action freezes, the angle rotates, and Fiona kicks two Merry Men at the same time. The part with the magic mirror was also hillarious. I like how the mirror was honest with Farquaad, informing him that \\"he really wasn't a king, and this isn't a kingdom,\\" to which Farquaad gestures to Thelonious as to what happens to a \\"lying\\" mirror (Thelonious punches a small handheld mirror), and the mirror counteracts \\"...but you can be king,\\" and shows three different women, \\"Dating Game\\" style. The scene at Farquaad's amusement park was hillarious, especially with the \\"It's a Small World\\"-esque puppets singing.<br />This was a great film, complete with a great cast, and is a fun story. This definitely breaks allthose rules that fairy tales tend to set (and believe me, rules were made to be broken). I am anxiously awaiting the sequel in 2004, and highly recommend this to everyone and their 5th cousin once removed (LOL! just kidding). This is a great story of romance and wonder, and it is sure to be a hit for years to come.<br />Donkey: Hi, Princess. Fiona: It talks! Shrek: Yeah, it's getting him to shutup that's the trick!<br />Ok, maybe I'll take this as advice. See \\"Shrek,\\" you won't regret it!!

This is their 8th cd and one of their best. I like the cd Stupid Dream alot also. If you have a chance to see them live do so...Its a kick to see them pull off this complex music live. The group is not well knowen in the US so catch a rising star.
0812513495|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in my life.  Being an avid reader I do not say this lightly.  When you do read this book make sure you have no pressing buisness for the next few days as you will cancel them to finish this masterpiece.

B000002UJQ|5.0|There is NO album that deals better with the frustration and tensions of the 1990s than OK Computer. During the 90s, the term ``information overload'' came into popular usage. People were having TOO MUCH information flowing into their brains. Society was expecting people to soak everything up and write it to a disk for later processing (cf. Stranger In A Strange Land, Mike's ability to grok, or meditate on, information at a later date).<br />OK Computer begins with Airbag, and then becomes more and more frantic and helter-skelter until finally collapsing into Fitter Happier. After we come out from the other side, the album slowly begins to wind down after the violent backlash of Climbing Up The Walls, and ends with a single triangle note after 53 minutes of music.<br />The album deals with human beigns turning into  technological products, and how we deal with them. From the violent car crash of Airbag, to the alien abduction of Subterranian Homesick Alien, to the political outcry of Electioneering, to the soothing croon of No Surprises, this album encompasses all the feelings of the 90s, and also, of ANY human experience.<br />And then we have Paranoid Android. At 6'23\\", it is the longest song on the album. A firm contender for one of the greatest songs of all time with its soaring crys of \\"What's that...?\\" to the rancorous screaming of \\"OFF WITH HIS HEAD MAN\\" to the funky \\"gucci little piggy\\" to the floating ambiance of \\"Rain down\\" to the almost surreal \\"Thats it sir / you're leaving / the cracklin' / of pigskin / the dust and the screamin' / the yuppies networking / the panic / the vomit / the panic / the vomit / God love his children / God loves his children, yeah!\\", this song is a monumental dreamscape (as is the rest of OK Computer) that one could spend 10,000 words analyzing, disecting, and componentizing. How fitting that would be, for a song central to an album that is seemingly a cry against the dehumanization of society, and a rally cry for the forces ofthe Holistic view, those who want to find our greater place in things, those who look \\"high up above\\" where \\"aliens hover\\" and wish that they'd \\"swoop down in a country lane late at night when I'm drivin' / Take me on board their beautful ship and show me the world as I'd love to see it\\".<br />I cannot say enough about this album. Like one of the other reviewers, I am dismayed to see that it is only 4.5 stars. Amazon should make a 6 star category for this album! Anyone who loves great music that much, and wants Radiohead's seminal album of the 90s to get back up to 5 stars, please, please, click the `helpful' icon, and then VOTE and WRITE A REVIEW!! Don't give Radiohead and OK Computer \\"the emptiest of feelings\\" or make them \\"dissapointed people / clinging onto bottles\\" and don't let when your review be \\"oh so dissapointing\\". DON'T LET US DOWN!
B00005Y228|5.0|I finally gave in and bought the CD.  I am not disappointed.  I pop it in my portable CD player at the gym and it has the exact tempo that you need for getting a great workout!  You will definitely break a sweat.  The CD I got actually has 14 tracks on it.  Bought it a Wal-Mart.  Will remind you of 80s Madonna.
B00006JLX4|5.0|Throw away your copy of Stuff Up the Cracks. Or hang onto it. But this is very, very great. A big booklet, man. I don't want to say cheeky stuff showing how familiar I am with Pavement lore. Like many fans of S&E, though, the song \\"Here\\" makes me cry for my lost youth, and the Peel Session version has that extra oomph.
0060977493|3.0|This review is a summary of opinions of the Dallas/Lakewood Book Club, which meets once a month at a Club member's home in Dallas.<br />Our Book Club chose The God of Small Things as our first selection to read and discuss.  We considered about a dozen possibilities, but chose this one because of its critical acclaim and because one of the club members had read it and strongly recommended it.<BR>  <BR>The Club is made up of folks who have quite a wide variety of tastes in books - some like a light read with a direct, fast-paced story line; others' tastes run more toward dense, classical works that provoke deep analysis; and still others prefer creative, ground-breaking or controversial works.<br />As a result, the reaction to The God of Small Things was very mixed.  Club members who enjoy classic literature and poetry loved Arundhati Roy's poetic language, and her superb use of imagery to describe the complex emotions of the book's characters.  For them, the book did a terrific job of conveying the plight of characters who are doomed to their fate by powerful circumstances beyond their control - the caste system, the vestiges of British imperialism, sexual abuse, and society's ill treatment of divorced women and their children.  <br />But that sense of doom and determinism bothered the Club members who prefer a more direct story line and who look for growth in the characters.  They would have liked to see one or more of the characters transcend the circumstances; instead, they felt that the book was rather depressing and that they could not relate to the characters.  Another major issue for most folks was that it was difficult to keep track of the characters and the story line.  Roy's indirect way of telling of the story caused most of the club members to have to backtrack and re-read portions of some chapters in order to follow the plot.  Her extensive use of metaphors, oblique prose, and frequent coining of new words became rather tiring for some, causing them tolose interest in the characters.  While creative use of the language is refreshing, several folks felt that it was overdone, and a bit gratuitous.<br />So overall, we give The God of Small Things two-and-one-half stars (amazon.com's system doesn't officially let you use halves of stars, so we rounded up).  It is a great read for those who enjoy new and interesting use of the language, but don't bother reading it if you're looking for a fast-paced story that pulls you in from the first page.
0783241569|4.0|Richard Curtis (writer of Four Weddings and a Funeral, and co-writer of The Vicar of Dibley, Mr. Bean, The Black Adder, and Bridget Jones's Diary) is, at least in my books, a fairly safe bet when it comes to comedy.  Like Four Weddings and a Funeral, this film is a light (albeit fanciful) romantic British comedy which proceeds at a gentle pace, with the humour being characteristically understated and seasoned with some very funny moments.  As with so many British comedies, the humour is primarily dialogue-based with very little reliance on slapstick or silly gags.   <br />The film stars Hugh Grant (an actor whom, I will confess right now, I enjoy) as William Thacker, the rather reserved owner of a travel book shop in the Notting Hill district of London.  Thacker meets Anna Scott (Julia Roberts), a high-profile Hollywood actress, when she wanders into his book shop.  Things more or less progress from there, with the tensions arising from the stressors one would naturally expect to surface in any relationship involving a famous individual.  <br />The supporting actors are absolutely wonderful in this film, with my favourite being James Dreyfus (The Thin Blue Line's side-splittingly funny Constable Goody), who is the real show stealer as Thacker's hilarious shop assistant, Martin.  Dreyfus's role is a small one (and I'd have loved to have seen more use made of him), but he is certainly pivotal in providing the film with some of its funniest moments.  Then there is Emma Chambers's portrayal of Thacker's ditsy, hare-brained sister, Honey (a character very similar to Chambers's role as the air-headed Alice Tinker in The Vicar of Dibley).  Of course, one must not forget Thacker's Welsh flatmate, Spike, a slovenly, tactless, not to mention witless idiot.<br />The Special Edition of the video contains (after the closing credits) roughly seven clips that were edited out of the film, which I really enjoyed seeing.  Following this is a five-minute behind-the-scenes tour with Hugh Grant, during which the viewer is introduced to Grant's parents (which was kind of nice). <br />In short, though I'm not a person who is normally attracted to the romantic comedy genre in general, I am a huge fan of British comedy, and I really quite enjoyed this film.  But then Richard Curtis has a distinctive brand of humour which (at least in my opinion) is always highly enjoyable.  Those who've enjoyed his other offerings (particularly Four Weddings and a Funeral, which bears the closest similarity to this one) will surely enjoy this film.  Even if you're not familiar with Curtis (or with British comedies in general), I would not hesitate to recommend this film to anyone who enjoys and is looking for a really sweet, light romantic comedy.  (Oh, and if you enjoyed this film, please check out The Vicar of Dibley--you'll not be disappointed.  It's not a romantic comedy, but it contains the same type of humour and it is hands down one of the funniest shows around!)
B000066F6H|3.0|Yes, this cd, along with the White Stripes, Strokes, Vines are all over-hyped, but ya know what? So be it! It's rock 'n roll, nothing new about it at all, but it sure beats rap rock, nu metal, and whatever Nickelback is.<BR>But if you've only got a few bucks to spend, I suggest the new Foo Fighters or Boxcar Racer.
0446310786|5.0|There are few books that comes along that will make you sit down and examine the way you look and fell about people in society, and this is one of them. In this book, Harper Lee tells the story of a society which is filled with rascism and sterotypes. Atticus Finch, a local lawyer, is not like other people in the town and is determined to stand up for what he belives is right. Even if this means putting his family, career, and even his life in danger. This book will also take you back to your childhood and the way that most children look at the world. This book should be required to read because it helps to break down sterotypes in the world. This book has been critized for showing too much racism but unfortunately people get upset when authors show the world its own shame.
B00006GO9Q|5.0|&quot;In a Silent Way&quot; is more than another great album from Miles Davis.  For me, it's also an extended lullabye and a soothing and hypnotic rush of total calm.  These two tracks don't have the upbeat bounce you'd expect, but they'll richly reward the listener who's willing to accept the album on its own terms.  Davis continues to push the envelope, taking on an unconventional approach to jazz.  At first, the organ in &quot;Shhh/Peaceful&quot; threw me off a bit, but it later grew on me, and I found that it nicely compliments the guitar and Miles' trumpet.  This track is 18 minutes of out-of-this-world etheral cool.  &quot;In a Silent Way/It's About That Time&quot; is a smoothed out, gentle number with a very-1969 funky guitar lick, soft yet effective percussion, and nice bass work.  This is music to sleep to, but in no way do I imply that this CD is boring. As I mentioned before, this album gives off a complete and elegant sense of calm.  If you work at a high stress job during the day, then this is the CD you definitely want to play when you get home.  It'll physically and emotionally relax you.  The one bad thing about this disc is that it's only 38 minutes long.  Like all great albums, I never wanted it to end.
B00000K3D4|5.0|IF i could name any perfect movie that i have seen it would have to be this one. Its one of the best i have ever seen. I was reading some other reviews and i came across one that said something like the special effects werent that great, and it had a cheesy ending, and i am thinking to myself who cares its a great movie, its not that big of deal to have a great ending, or great special effects. That it so stupid to say. I first saw this movie at one of my friends house, and i fell in love with, so the next night i  found it at a movie store and rented it, and recorded it, and now i am thinking about getting the sound track, and buying it on DVD. And my friends fell in love with it as soon as they watched it. I dont know why i love this movie so much i just do. It might be because its just great or that David Bowie is incredibly sexy, along with his voice. I really cant tell you. Bye!
B00003CX5P|4.0|It has to be said that STAR WARS EPISODE 1: THE PHANTOM MENACE isn't as good as the recently released ATTACK OF THE CLONES. Part II has better action, more impressive special effects and hardly any Jar Jar! But TPM does have some good points that make it an enjoyable entry into the franchise.<br />Pod races, spectacular CGI, lightsaber battles and outer space battles all combine to create a sense of fun in the biggest form. The FX throughout the film is impressive, with CG characters interacting with their human counterparts. John Williams' score for the film is brilliant, evoking the themes of the charcters and action with a bold, operatic approach which is familiar but welcome. George Lucas' visionary approach to the film creates a world rich in diversity and fascinating creatures.<br />The action is the film's strong point, and this one has enough fun action set pieces to compensate for the lack of good characters and the slow pacing. Liam Neeson is good as Qui- Gon Jinn, Obi Wan Kenobi's master, and Darth Maul is great as Sith Lord Darth Maul, despite his rather short screen time. But McGregor's Obi Wan is a mere cipher and most of the characters aren't that good in comparison to the well-written heroes and villians in A NEW HOPE and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. And then there's Jar Jar. While he's actually not as bad as most critics think, he's not one of the most likable characters in the saga.<br />But all that is missing the point completly. STAR WARS isn't about acting, it's about the good old-fashioned story of good vs. evil, all done in spectacular fashion with lightsaber fights. And while it's below par compared to ATTACK OF THE CLONES, it's nontheless a fun, action-filled entry into one of the most well-loved film franchises of all time.<br />The DVD's extra features are impressive, with a commentary from Lucas and the special effects team, an extensive 'making of' documentary, deleted scenes, trailers and much, much more. The digital transfer is first-rate and the animated interactive menus are really imaginative. All put together in an impressive 2-Disc pack, this is one must-own DVD.nd the animated interactive menus are really imaginative.

B000065RMP|5.0|Only purchase if you are serious about music. It is one of the most enlightening experiences you will ever have. Everyone I know who is passionate about music has this CD. It is absolutely breathtaking... oh and if you want other credits, Thom Yorke had Sigur Ros open up for Radiohead in Europe because he felt the same way about them as I do...
B00003CX9Q|5.0|Both versions of Steven Spielberg's masterpiece are available on this limited edition DVD of E.T- THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL. The original 1982 and the 2002 re-mastered version are equally impressive. The minor cuts and restored footage doesn't add much. Sure, the CG E.T is impressive and there are some great moments put back in that make the film feel more complete. But the heart of the film stays the same. Differing from Spielberg's more strident films (JAWS, the INDIANA JONES films and JURASSIC PARK), E.T is the simple story of Elliot (Henry Thomas) who finds a friend from space and helps him to find his way home, hence the oft-quoted line &quot;E.T phone home!&quot;. The iconic image of Elliot riding past the moon is one of the most memorable movie moments in cinema history, accompanied by John William's whimsical score (Another coup-de-grace par-excellence). The film itself is still emotionally involving and the peformances of the principal actors, especially Henry Thomas and Drew Barrymore are fantastic. Regardless of the film's 2002 theatrical dissapointment, Spielberg's masterful storytelling holds up to this day. One of my all-time favourites, E.T will always be remembered as one of the greatest cinema experiences in film history.<br />The DVD extras are very impressive. Startting off with Disc One, the 2002 version has an introduction by Steven Spielberg, a live performance of John Williams conducting at the 2002 premiere and an &quot;exciting space exploration&quot;. Disc Two has the 1982 version. the extras include a &quot;Spotlight on Location&quot; featurette, The Reunion: The cast and filmmakers talk sbout the film. The Evolution and Creation of ET: hundreds of production photographs, conceptual drawings and original advertising in an interactive environment. Also included are theatrical trailers and DVD-ROM features. A must have DVD.
0316666343|2.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend whose judgment I ordinarily trust. Unlike her promise, I couldn't wait to put it down! I don't mind well-written fantasy - say, Hundred Years of Solitude - but this just isn't close. It is cute, sentimental, a challenge to anyone's ability to suspend disbelief. Don't waste your time.
B0000073NC|4.0|Scorpions _World Wide Live_ was the first album I ever purchased for myself, a monstrous, treasured double-vinyl artifact that I literally wore the grooves out on.  Years later, having navigated through plenty of phases with my fickle musical tastes, I was turned on and totally blown away by the heretofore unexplored Uli Jon Roth era, of which this album, though probably not the best, is by far my personal favorite.  You can almost smell the incense burning from the first chords.  Although the songwriting is uneven, with Roth taking too many vocal turns, the textures and art-rock song structures are mezmerizing, especially on the title track, where Roth's gorgeous, classically-informed technique leads into a track which is some kind of psychadelic metal masterpiece, the kind of track Hawkwind wishes they had the chops to play and Yngwie Malmsteen is still trying to write to this day.  &quot;Speedy's Coming&quot; is a great, racous opener and features the first really strong Klaus Meine vocal workout along with some great tongue-in-cheek lyrics (&quot;Do you like Alice Cooper/Do you like Ringo Starr?&quot;).   The intricate, gorgeous intro to &quot;They Need a Million&quot; leads into a telltale flamenco-influenced chord progression and showcases Uli Jon Roth's Hendrix-meets-Blackmore soloing (also, unfortunately, his singing).  The keyboards on quasi-operatic background vocals are very strange things to find on a Scorpions record, and while many folks may deem them somewhat silly, I find them strangely intoxicating.  If &quot;This is My Song&quot; seems somewhat redundant, the delicate, Floydian ballad &quot;Far Away&quot; should make it forgivable.  If you approach this as more of a guitarist's record (as it is easy to see Uli Jon Roth was in the spotlight here) the blueprints for the 80's neoclassical shredder can be seen here.  But its not a bad intro to the Scorps' early output, either, and it definitely belongs in any hard rock afficianado's collection.
B00006AG5N|4.0|On June 2nd 1956 Billboard top 40 hits listed I want you, I need you, I love you as Number One. Where is it?<br />This is a great collection of hits. 14 of these hits never reached number one. 10 of these never even reached number 2.<br />Don't get me wrong. These are all great songs, but if you are going to call it #1's. You should at the very least have all of the number 1's first. Then add the others. Don't Y'all think so?
B000002G26|5.0|Bryan Adams is one of the most gifted musicians out there!  I bought this CD b/c I love every song on it and can listen to it without skipping.  This is a must have for anyone and a classic.
B000066NW0|4.0|Avril Lavigne<br />First off, let's remember something here when considering this album.  She is only 17.  What you cannot expect on this album is extremely insightful perfection in lyrics and the best thing you've ever heard in your life.  I have read so many of the reviews on here which criticize the same things: banal lyrics, trite lyrics, cheesy lyrics, etc., etc., I could go on listing adjectives but there's no point.  The point missed by all these people is that, for her age, this album IS impressive.  They're just viewing it through the lens of, say, a 50 year old.  It is quite obvious that a 50-year old will have seen more and learned more life lessons than a 17 year old.  So stop saddling a 17-year old with the idea that she has to be some kind of visionary, some kind of prophet.  Also, this is her first effort!  No one ever achieves perfection out of the starting gate, much as musical artists have come in the years past that have been given this distinction by this or that critic.<br />And now on to the music.  The debut single (even more huge in Canada) \\"Complicated\\" is a pleasant and effective tune but may suffer here a tad from overplaying, and the same can be said for \\"Sk8er Boi\\".  And not to go off on another tangent, but why all the gaff about the spelling of that?  What really matters is if the music moves you, not how the title of it is spelled....this is another thing that, if people I've heard who criticize this album were to be believed, signalled the coming apocalypse...it just isn't so.  But back to the music at hand.  Avril creates a mostly attractive lyrical setup for the 13 tracks found here.  She sometimes comes across like she's trying too hard (the well-sung but seemingly over-expressed singing of \\"With You\\") but then makes up for it splendidly with the pleading ballad \\"Anything But Ordinary\\", \\"Things I'll Never Say\\" and the bouncy, fun \\"My World\\", with a quirky little line seemingly defending the cliche that all women spend way too longin the shower.  It doesn't come across well in this review, but it sounds well placed and even amusing the way it's sung in the song, to hear her revelling in what I guess you could call a guilty pleasure.  \\"Losing My Grip\\" has a very catchy sound, but gets somewhat repetitive at the end.  It doesn't make it a terrible song, just not the best on the album.  And the rage of \\"Unwanted\\" sometimes seems unfocused, like the idea of a song that didn't quite make it all the way.<br />These things having been said, give Avril a chance....she's not the corporate tooled \\"anti-britney-yet-still-banal-and-poppy\\" fluff too many call her.  She's not the greatest artist out there.  She's not the worst either.  What she has is a mostly solid album which is, again, indicative of her age.....if it seems like not the weightiest thing on the earth, it's to be expected...if it seems inexperienced, well, come on people!  As I said before, she is 17....and for that age, I think she's done a pretty good job.  As always, you're free to judge for herself, but herein I recite my classic line: Pick this up and give it an honest chance....you might just like it
B00005JKPF|5.0|X-Men 2 is based on a X-Men graphic novel called, \\"God Loves, Man Kills\\".  Considered one of the best stories ever told in the X-Men universe!  In X2, the main baddie is a man named Gen. William Striker who leads an assault against the X-Men... at the school!  Joining Striker will be Yuriko Oyama, aka Lady Deathstrike, Mystique and other mutant baddies along with Striker's own forces.  In the movie, Gen. Striker holds the keys to Wolverine's past in which he is so desperately seeking.  X2's final major battle takes place at the abanded military base at Alkali Lakes which Professor X told Wolverine about in the first movie.  Mutant cameos include Gambit, Colossus and many, many more.  Unfortunately, Beast's cameo has been cut and there will be no Danger Room scene or Sentinel action.  But this movie sounds action packed, unlike the first one, and will be the \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" of this franchise.
B00003CWL6|4.0|I'd like to address some of the criticisms made in earlier reviews about this film and offer my interpretation. The main criticism seems to be twofold: firstly, the film uses cliched characters rather than realistic portraits, secondly, the film offers a simplistic message about breaking out of mundane everyday life.<br />To begin with, yes the film does use cliches. It's deliberate. At no time does American Beauty claim to be a realistic portrayal of suburban life. It uses extremes and saturated emotions, as well as saturated colours in the cinematography, to offer an incisive, sarcastic, and over the top criticism of Western Culture. (Althought the film is set in suburban America I think it could have been set in the affluent suburbs of many Western nations and still have been apt.) The characters are consciously and obviously stereotyped - the middle aged man in the throws of a mid life crisis, the shallow and ambitious real estate agent, the beautiful cheerleader, the latently homosexual marine - but we are encouraged to recognise these as stereotypes and to focus on the way in which these figures struggle with the details, desires, and fears of their world. It is a hypereality that is being presented, and is which is used to mock and criticise the actual.<br />Some have seen the film as little more than a saccharine message about being true to yourself in the face of mediocrity. I think it is a film about the impossibility of just that. There is no happy ending, no comfortable resolution, Lester ends up dead, and those around him frustrated, imprisoned, and weary. It's a film about the way in which society succeeds in alienating us from ourselves and each other, not about trite attempts to break out. Lester's job quitting and his buffing up don't succeed in bringing him happiness. Nor does Caroline's affair or rifle range education. It is the small, temporal moments that give us pleasure: small, fleeting visions of beauty in a cold and frustrating world. Overall, the film ends on a sour note (gorgeously contradicted by the score) and argues that simply refusing to cooperate doesn't stop the machine from turning.
B00006AG5N|4.0|This is Elvis best single disc of hit songs ever released.  Vocally I've never heard him better.  All 30 songs sound like he is singing in the living room.  On a few numbers some instruments are heard for the first time.  However, there is a trade off.  The remastered versions take on an alternate take effect with the background music sounding like it's coming from down the hallway.  The midrange is MIA. Another thing the trademark \\"Presley Echo\\" from the 50's on the first part of the CD is almost non-existent.  The bonus track \\"A Little Less Conversation\\" is great, if your eating in a bar & grill and talking on the cell phone.  In closing, I'm going to keep my copy for auto driving where the high notes are most appreciated.  For serious music listening, I'll stick with the old albums.
0767830555|5.0|The importance of Taxi Driver cannot be overstated. More than a well made film, the movie is a genuine character study of the highest achievement. The absurdity of the decade in which the film was made lends an incredible amount of reinforcement to the presentation. The \\"conspicuous consumption\\" lifestyle of the 1970's makes the cheapness of human life depicted in the film (prostitution, exploitation, violence) seem all the more engaging. A few of the more important, albeit subtle scenes that I feel make the character study so realized include the following (I would ask that any viewer of the film pay close attention to these scenes and try to interpret the subtle importance of them as they relate to the character):<br />- Travis is sitting in his apartment watching American Bandstand on TV. He is angered by the celebration of adolescent sexuality he sees and how \\"human\\" and accessible it is portrayed to be. In contrast, Travis is completely unable to conceptualize himself in this rite of passage, due to the self loathing image he has built up in his mind. Travis then sees an empty pair of shoes on the floor amidst the dancing couples, a stark metaphor for his inability to relate to the world he finds himself in.   <br />- Travis, although seemingly articulate and confident about his emotional convictions in his journal entries, recognizes the impending disintegration of his mental state and decides to seek the advice of his colleague Wizard, in a last ditch effort to make sense of his feelings. Travis's somber desperation is evident in his discussion with Wizard and an attempt is made to address the situation. However, Wizard, who shares none of Travis's chronic isolationism, is unable to offer any helpful words to Travis, who is ultimately frustrated one last time in his final effort to salvage his sanity. In the closing shot of the scene, Travis tries to articulate his inexpressible frustrations, to which Wizard casually replies \\"you know... you're all right, you're all right\\". With his last attempt to make a human connection an utter failure, Travis is now locked into his path of destruction, a path that cannot be positively influenced by outside individuals due to his inability to express his feelings. It is a particularly chilling scene, perhaps the definitive example in the film depicting Travis's final fate. <br />- Travis is seen in his apartment room preparing for his confrontation with Senator Palentine. He speaks about his apocalyptic mission through his journal entries. However, his words portray a man unable to articulate himself even in his hour of destiny - \\"listen you f***ers, you screw heads, here is a man who would not take it anymore, who would.. not.....\\" (starts over) \\"listen you f***ers you screw heads.....\\". This scene is very effective in that it illustrates Travis's inability to express his emotions with certainty, even when they concern convictions which he feels strongly about.  <br />- Immediately after his attempted assassination of Palentine fails, Travis is seen driving to the tenement house where Sport hustles. Dazed, Travis is utterly absorbed by his psychosis, his face a portrait of a concentrated, murderous obsession. A pedestrian attempts to flag down his cab, but Travis blows right by the would-be customer, occupied only with the slaughter he is about to engage in. I feel that this scene perfectly capsulizes Travis's complete descent into madness.   <br />This film was cheated out of the best picture Oscar by Rocky, which (although a fine film in its own right) is a film that anybody can love. In contrast, Taxi Driver is a film that many people would prefer to avoid due to its cynical portrayal of human life. However, it is often the ugly things in life which are the more relevant, more engaging, more compelling, more real.
B00006JLX4|5.0|This one takes the cake. It is the best Pavement album ever. There is no way that you can top an album that includes the S &amp; E recordings, unreleased tracks, B sides, and best of all....live recordings. Cd #2 has the best live recording I have ever heard for a band. Pavement was really having alot of fun at that concert. I highly recommend picking this album up. Even for first time Pavement purchasers, this is the album that would get you hooked.
B000005HLV|5.0|Tremendous classic! even if you remind yourself that Euronymous was never the most technical guitar player in the world..., BUT he knew how to express lonelyness , darkness and evil in riffs like NO ONE else... coldnes in every chord... superb production... perfect for this kind of sounding... Attilas voKILLS are awesome.. they match wonderfully with Aaseth's dark riffs... great lirics... fast drumming and a hell of a bloody history.. that's Mayhem and forever it will be. GET THIS or GET OUT! 5 impressed stars for this masterpiece of 90's Norwegian Black Metal.
0345440900|5.0|I felt this was a great, resourceful book. I am expecting my first baby any day now and have already read the book twice.

Highly recommeneded even for those that are not interested in putting their baby on a &quot;routine&quot; or who are going to parent according to the &quot;attachment-parenting/demand feeding&quot; theory. The book offers insight into the cries of an infant &amp; gives sounds advice with how to cope &amp; care for your baby's cries, it does not just offer reason after reason for putting the baby on a routine. Good luck!
B00006J3WH|5.0|If there was ever a show deserving a second soundtrack, Buffy The Vampire Slayer is it. I know to some Once More, With Feeling seems a bit campy, but in my opinion it was one of the greatest episodes of Buffy ever. This soundtrack is totally unforgettable. We love you, Joss!
B00006IM9Q|5.0|Blondie remains they most creative and unique band in music history. Rock owes alot of respect to Blondie. In 1981 the band scored 2 #1 Singles in \\"The Tide is High\\" and \\"Rapture\\" introducing Rap and Reggae to the American Public, not to mention<BR>most of the planet. In 1979 they released the first ever Video album for their 1979 release \\"Eat to the Beat\\" some of the videos<BR>from that release are on this Greatest hits DVD version of this album. Blondie had mass appeal worldwide, their 1978 album \\"Parallel Lines\\" spawned no less than 6 International hits, and sold some 20 Million copies worldwide. As recent as the summer of 2002, Rolling Stone Magazine named \\"Parallel Lines\\" the 6th Coolest Album of all time. This Greatest Hits album has no less than 7 #1 songs, and numerous top ten singles. More than most Greatest Hits albums by any other artist, so your getting a big buy here. Blondie has written and performed some of Rock Music's finest moments, like \\"Call Me\\", \\"Atomic\\" and of course the legendary \\"Heart of Glass\\". Deborah Harry's Bi-Lingual vocals on the Euro Smash \\"Denis\\" is pure magic. The band has always been diverse in their endless search for music creativity. The throbbing EuroBeat of \\"Call me\\" and \\"Atomic\\", the<BR>Techno \\"Heart of Glass\\", the reggae tinted \\"The Tide is High\\" and<BR>of course the classic begingings of Hip Hop with \\"Rapture\\". Those fans that want the New Wave influenced hits, won't be<BR>disappointed either. There's the Punky \\"Rip Her to Shreds\\", the New Wave \\"One Way or Another and Hanging on the Telephone\\". Since Blondie's debute in 1977, they have remained a band true to form, and this Greatest Hits release features their 1999 MEGA EUROPEAN SMASH \\"MARIA\\" which was #1 all over the planet in 1999, but yet was so familiar, it seemed like it was 1979 instead. The Greatest Hits album is just a few months shy of a new Studio album. Seems like Blondie have more hits to come, and as Martha Stewart would say, \\"That's a good thing\\".
B00005JK8K|2.0|I like the idea of shining some light on how the Navaho language was used as code in WWII, but the rest of the movie was so full of clichs it was hard to watch.  Sure the action is good, audio very good, but there are so many unanswered questions left for me.  If your looking for an action film and don't mind all the clich - lines, background music, acting, one liners,  then it's great.  Otherwise Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down and even We were Soldiers are a much better choice.
0151008116|5.0|This is truly among the best books I have ever read.  As of today, it has won the prestigious Booker Award.  The story can be read on multiple levels and can be interpreted a number of ways, but from the first page it grabs you.  Besides the tale on the high seas, you also learn about the character's life in India and about the zoo his father owns.  Among other messages here (mentioned in other reviews), is definitely an envirnmnetalist one about zoo-keeping and our responsiblity in it.  The book has left me overcome with joy, wishing to share it with everyone.  Having said all of this, I can also say that the book is an easy read and I am almost ready to give it to my 10 year old (except for the very graffic death and eating scenes of various animals) I can not say enough about this marvelous book!!

B000005IU1|5.0|This is great-lots of energy, low technichal ability. The Velevet Underground and the Doors are obvious influences, but this is better than that. Also you hear Stones, Yardbirds, Bo Diddley, and Love, maybe a little Troggs. Despite all those influences, this is mostly out of the blue-one of the most original sounding albums ever. The Sex Pistols would sound something like this years later, but this is even better than that-less screaming, but more weirdness and more EMOTION. \\"I Wanna Be  Your Dog\\" is well liked and has been covered a few times (Slayer's version \\"I'm Gonna be your God\\" is the best of the remakes), but no one does it like The Stooges. \\"No Fun\\" was covered by the Pistols, but again, these guys do it best. The off beat drumming, the guitar and bass seeming to stray from the basic tune, and the most monotone (but still expressive) singing Iggy ever did make this jump out at you the first time you hear it.
B00000I01A|3.0|From the arena-ready anthem rockers to the shockingly awesome instrumentals, this one's guaranteed to get your fists pumpin', your heart a movin', and your blood a flowin'!  Set your dreams into reality with the Rocky IV soundtrack!!  I first heard this gem when I was 5 years old, and believe me, I was immediately hooked on all things Rocky!  <br />This album has its share of good, catchy rockers, plus a little soul, thanks to James Brown's \\"Living in America\\" anthem.  I pledge allegiance to James Brown!!<br />The best parts, however, would be the two instrumental tracks, which are a sure bet to get you off your lazy duff, and out onto the streets joggin'!  <br />Hey, quit watchin' that t.v. - Rocky don't like it....<br />YO ADRIAN!!!!
0312265859|5.0|HARD EIGHT was my first Janet Evanovich experience and so delicious, I'll definitely go back for seconds. If you need to lighten your load, if you feel inept, if you feel that the sky is falling, you need to read HARD EIGHT. It's fast-paced, hilarious, and not a book that will help you fall asleep. Stephanie Plum is smart, insecure, and incredibly unlucky, but it's hard to feel sorry for her, when you're laughing at each misadventure. Evanovich seems to have brought out every weird or stereotypical character she's ever encountered and plopped them into Stephanie's life at just the right moments. HARD EIGHT is slapstick in print with an ending that is reached with the help of two guardian hunks.
6305358613|3.0|I have viewed this film three times since I first saw it during its debut at the theaters. The film is plagued with numerous inaccuracies which is a puzzle to me. <br />Anyone that has read the history of Elizabeth R understands that there was enough political intrigue, religious zealots, overall soap opera drama to just tell the story accurately. <br />In my first viewing I was so upset over the historical misrepresentations that I could not enjoy the film. Fortunately I decided to come back and view it again. <br />The acting is superb. Cate's interpetation of Elizabeth is not as good as Glenda Jackson's performance in the PBS production of Elizabeth R, but it is refreshing and interesting. The supporting cast is excellent too.<br />This film is worth watching even with its historical inaccuracies.
0385474547|5.0|Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart is the story of a strong and successful man, Okonkwo, living in the African village of Umofia.<br />Okonkwo is a man with different sides.  Outwardly, he is fierce and aggressive, but his actions show that he is a kind and loving person, though he hides these feelings to preserve his masculinity.  Because Okonkwo's father was a failure and died disgracefully, Okonkwo is constantly trying to prove his manliness and worthiness.  As a result, he becomes prosperous, has several wives and children, and earns the respect of his clan.  <br />After killing his friend's son in an unfortunate accident, Okonkwo is, as the custom requires, banished from his village for seven years.  He and his family move to his deceased mother's village, where he is still successful, but longs for his old way of life in Umofia.  In the meantime, English missionaries have arrived in the area, and are slowly winning over more converts.  As a result of this invasion, the villagers' traditional beliefs about their gods are being challenged and their way of life threatened.  After the seven years is up, he is finally able to return to his old village, but is saddened by how things have changed, and how the missionaries' influence has destroyed years of tradition.  The shocking ending is very emotional, and reveals what kind of man Okonkwo really was.       <br />Achebe does a splendid job in developing Okonkwo's character and by the end of the story he becomes someone whom you sympathise with and care about.  This makes the ending all the more emotional and disturbing.  I cannot remember reading a more gripping book in a long time.  <br />This is a masterpiece, chosen as one of the 100 greatest works of fiction by several of the most prominent writers around the world, with good reason.
0440237688|4.0|First of all, I am sorry about my poor English and writing skills.<BR> Jonas who will become 12 years old is in a community. In there, everything is under control and everything is decided by rule. However, nobody has doubt on the rule. Every person is accepted a rule in community. For example, people cannot choose their spouse by themselves. Every family units have 4 member, such as father, mother, son, and daughter. There is a not cleavage in community between rich and poor. <br /> When children become 12 years old, every child will receive assignment (occupation) from the elders.

B00003CXRP|5.0|&quot;Castaway&quot; is a great movie. For most of the movie Tom Hanks is by himself and he is able to do. Hanks is able to deliver a powerful performance about how a person is able to surivive the worst situration.  I will never understand how Tom didn't win the oscar for that year.
0316666343|2.0|Gentle Readers...this was not my type of book.  I was expecting a gritty crime story and what I got was fluff.  The basic idea of the book intrigued me; however, I found most of the characters boring and the author's writing style lacking.  In defense of the book, I was the ONLY member of my book club who didn't like it -- the rest of them are still raving about it. It would probably make a good movie -- so I gave it 2 stars!
0316666343|5.0|I wanted to cry everytime I read this book! It's a sad, haunting, and touching story that I found myself thinking of it often. I was really drawn into Susie and her life/afterlife and how she watched over the effects of her disappearance/murder. Her view of heaven reminded me of the book \\"What Dreams May Come\\". There are so many aspects of \\"The Lovely Bones\\" that I could go deeper into and discuss, but you should read it for yourself. Yes, some people found it depressing and I do admit, it was sad. But I didn't get depressed or upset by this story.  I thought the family and friends storylines show how something so tragic can stay with you and change you forever. If you want to read a good book, this is it.
B000002PCS|5.0|Never has a movie produced such beautiful music before than that of &quot;Somewhere In time.&quot;  Besides the classical pieces by Rachmoninof, John Barry's compositions truly haunt the soul with an unrequited yearning that the characters in the film had for each other.  You can see the characters in the music.  So few movies have ever contained music that evoked such rememberance than this film.<br />This is truly a romantic album.  Great for any occasion, the music will full your day with beautya nd tranquility.  Buy this CD and you will not regret your purchase.
0312979479|5.0|&quot;And Then There Were None&quot; is thoroughly intriguing and mind bending.  You will become so engrossed, you will not want to put this book down - take it from someone who experienced this.  Just when you have an inkling about who &quot;Mr. Owen&quot; is, you're thrown a curve-ball that will send you back to reread passages.  Read the book before you see the movie version, &quot;Ten Little Indians,&quot; although both are excellent.  Whether you're a mystery fan, or not, this book is a must read.  I recommend.
B00005UW9T|5.0|Anastasia has been one of the best disney movies I have watched in a long time.I love the songs(Journey to the past sung by Aaliyah and Once upon a December). It is only a cartoon and does not have to be historically correct like some reviewers were suggesting.If we wanted to know what happened in real life we would read a history book.This movie was written to entertain young viewers and alot of what really happened is not suitable for young childen.I think Disney did a excellent job as always.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Wilco's 'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot' is one of those fuzzy albums that seeps into you like some infectious disease that you don't know what it is, but after awhile, it is comfortable and you like the way it feels and sounds to you. <br />In a way, it has these funny messages to it, as of on'Ashes of American Flags', where it sems to be a breaking news report going on; or on 'Poor Places', where you hear a strange voice just keep saying the album tilte over and over again, strange huh. <br />Not really if you think about it; because remember, Wilco's record lable did not want to release this album at first listen, but through the act of bidding wars(that usually go on for great albums like this one), the group was signed to another record lable and have become more of a mainstream band, and have gained more acclaim because of it.
B00004STPT|5.0|I went a bought the second CD thinking it made no difference. IT DOES!! This CD is much better and exact to the movie. I enjoyed every minute of it. But this one and leave the other CD alone. You will find all the sounds from the movie in this CD. You will adore it. Believe me.
B00006IU73|5.0|Tim Honebrink ..., October 24, 2002   ... PORCUPINE TREE finally has appeared to the growing masses of searching souls, With a brilliant, Yet familiar next step into the P. T. history. ABSENTIA will flow into your mind, with a martyr's passion of truth and distained beauty. With a true heart for Prog / Psych music, I feel the most important track on this new masterpiece is the song \\"The Sound Of Muzak\\" for it's ever so true statement, of our present place in todays music scenery. I live, I breath, and will always sit up next to TREE!
B00005JKCH|5.0|After all the hype surrounding this movie, there was plenty of room for disappointment ... but there was none.  Spider-Man truly delivered all the action, excitement, and special effects that the hype promised.  Maguire was a fantastic and surprisingly studly Spider-Man.  Dafoe was born to play villains so no complaints there either.  I am not even a fan of the comic book or the cartoon but thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Although the action and themes were perhaps a bit intense for a young audience, at least it wasn't overly gory.  That's a huge plus in my book.  No gratuitous anything in this movie which is always tempting for blockbuster-makers.  The door is wide open for a sequel, but unlike Batman, I think this franchise has potential.  However, this first one is a must-see regardless.  Pure entertainment!
0783230702|5.0|A terrific movie, whether you see it as a time-travel story, an exposition on madness, a journey through paradox, or even a love story.  It is all these things and more, with a sad melancholy that truly makes you appreciate our society, messed-up as it is.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This movie was fantastic!  Not a live film yet not quite an &quot;animated&quot; film, this flick was truly unique.  Beside the amazing graphics, the story line was what you would expect without being overly predictable.  But the real story is the characters.  Mike Myers was a phenomenal Shrek.  The voice, it's accent, and inflections really made the character both funny and endearing.  Eddie Murphy was beyond hysterical as Donkey.  In fact, Donkey was a real scene-stealer.  This is an instant classic that you should be able to enjoy time and again.  You can't not like this movie!<br />Extras on this DVD are numerous and first-rate.  Definitely helps to have DVD-ROM but not required.
B00005U8EM|5.0|This is a TERRIFIC movie.  Get the &quot;Special Edition&quot; if you don't own it, otherwise be happy with the version you got.
6305508550|5.0|That sums it up for me anyway.  If you like to laugh, you will like this movie.  If you work for a beaurocratic company where bosses are a farce, you will love this movie.  Office Space is simply fantastic at emphasizing and personifying the Dilbert principles.  It's all here: cubicles, fake smiles, paper pushing, moronic promotions ... all the things you hate about your job but can't do anything about.  This guy will be your hero!
B000002KNI|5.0|1. This is the only album where you're going to get Garfunkel vocals and S&G harmonies on Paul Simon's solo songs, and it works fantastically.  \\"American Tune\\" for example, is incredible.<BR>2. For a live concert in front of half a million people, the recording quality and vocals are fantastic.  The quality is basically as good as a studio produced album.<BR>3. I have found that I don't care for the production on a lot of the original S&G studio versions of their songs.  They have a lot of effects like cannons and [stuff] like that.  Being live, they don't have a lot of the studio effects which I think detract from the songs.
B00006HBUA|4.0|I am a long-time Scooby Doo fan so I was pretty psyched for this movie.  But I was a little skeptical at the same time.  Both feelings turned out to be founded.  The movie, on pure entertainment value, was very good and was certainly suitable for the whole family.  The characters were generally well-cast.  Can't imagine why Freddie Prinze, Jr. would come to mind for the part of Fred (other than the obvious name sharing), but he did just fine in the role.  Not sure why Sarah Michelle Gellar was the choice for Daphne, but again, fine job.  I had never heard of Linda Cardellini, but she proved to be a fantastic Velma.  Scooby was very cute and the \\"voice\\" was on-target, but his coloring was a bit off to be technical.  He was much browner in the cartoon and his spots were black.  But I digress.  SHAGGY, now Shaggy was worth the price of admission.  Matthew Lillard IS Shaggy.  If I watched this movie a second time, it would be for Lillard's performance.  I couldn't get over how well he nailed the voice, the look, the mannerisms, etc.  You will be amazed.  The plot had quite a twist at the end that will surely surprise you if no one has spoiled it for you yet.  Most of the essential Scooby elements are there.  That's the good news.  The bad news is that they \\"updated\\" Scooby Doo a bit too much.  They interjected way too much R&B-type music and humor that just wasn't there in the original ... and wasn't necessary in the remake.  Each persona's quirks or tendencies were magnified with the exception of Shaggy who, again, was true to form.  I might have toned it down and kept the characters more in line with the original.  All in all, a good movie and a reasonable treatment of a truly classic pooch-flick.
B00005V9HH|5.0|This is, without question, one of the best films of 1995, and one of the best mysteries ever. It feels sort of like MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. You'll spend the whole movie wondering who's messing with whom, who the mysterious Keyser Söze is, and what he's after.<br />A group of mismatched criminals, played to perfection by the cast, are lumped together for a crime apparently none of them were guilty of. Irritated at having their time wasted, they decide to even the score by releaving a few less than honest cops of their less than honest merchandise. This sets into motion a chain of events that will lead them to Keyser's lawyer, Kobayashi. From there, well, I don't want to ruin it for you.<br />This film opened the same year as SEVEN, in which Kevin Spacey (then a relatively unknown character actor) played an uncredited role. This was a vehicle for Spacey, and he works it like a wind-up watch. (From here, he would go onto the equally great LA CONFIDENTIAL.) Gabriel Burns is his usual talented self, and Benicio Del Toro is hilarious as Fenster.<br />If you're looking for a good mystery that doesn't treat the audience like idiots, this one is for you. Told in a series of present and flashback story lines, you'll have to think it out a little. It's worth it, though, in the end to know Who Is Keyser Söze?
B000035Z1Z|5.0|This movie has all the elements of a great romantic comedy, especially Meg Ryan.  Meg rarely fails in this genre (or at all really).  Meg is her usually plucky, witty, absolutely adorable self in this tale of a woman wronged by her fiance because she is too predictable and stuck in her ways.  The solution?  Be unpredictable and unconventional of course!  And there lies the humor and fun of the movie.  This journey of self-realization through reckless abandon takes her to Paris where she runs into a French criminal played by Kevin Kline.  Take note I said Kevin Kline because you WON'T recognize him in the movie.  If you've seen Kline in other roles like In & Out or Dave or any number of others, you will be shocked to see him play a very sexy Frenchman here.  He does a fantastic job of it too.  You get attached to Meg's character quickly and you can't help but to love Kline even though he plays a criminal ... which the writers want you to do.  This is quite a charming tale of good girl/bad boy romance amidst some great situational humor.  Add some beautiful scenery and what more could you ask for?
B000000ZGO|5.0|Being a fan of both 70s soul and the extended length and free interpretation of jazz music, it is no wonder that I would find this album to be a favourite when I purchased it for my birthday this year (not my fault; I am pretty young so I had never really heard of it before since the album was recorded about 7 year after my PARENTS were born!). I had previously bought the less experimental \\"Black Moses\\" album and I was impressed with his skills, but it is this album that cements him as the Stax counterpart (and even precursor in some sense) to Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder of Motown since they all contributed their skills to revolutionise the genre from pop hit machines to an artform. And check out that cover; I'm sure some less knowledgeable people would be easily fooled into believing it was R Kelly!<br />The orchestration on this album is impeccable, especially on the opening \\"Walk On By\\" and the two middle tracks are equally excellent.<br />It is a different story for \\"By The Time I Get To Phoenix\\". It is not just excellent, it is mindblowing. Isaac 'sets up' the song. He just keeps talking and talking, telling us the story of how the man in the song got to his position. Then suddenly, when you think he could keep talking forever, he begins to sing; and it is one of the most magical moments in music history.<br />Not one for the road (you'd probably [anger] all the people who find the songs too long) or one for a party, but definately one yo enjoy by yourself or with someone you love who hopefully has a deep appreciation for great music.
B00003CY6M|5.0|I LOVED this movie!  The plot was absurd, the events and sequences completely far-fetched, the timing impossible, and the match-up unlikely.  But you know what?  Who cares!  The warm and fuzzy awwwww-factor blew all that away.  This is a great wintertime or Christmas movie, especially curled up in front of the fire with someone special.  Some might call it a chick-flick.  I call it a good romantic comedy that is worthy of owning and watching more than once.  John Cusack was incredibly endearing in this movie and Kate Beckinsale was an exceptional co-star.  There's not much cast beyond them and that's good.  It's really all about these two people and the remarkable way they come together.  It's simply charming.
0805062971|5.0|This is the the story of Tyler Durden. I would tell you about the rest of it, but I don't want to give it away. I recently read this book, after first seeing the movie. The movie was a good try at translating the book to film. As is usually the case, the book is even better than the movie though. I really like Chuck Palahniuk's style of writing a lot - it's to the point. No flowery prose here.<br />My only downside to reading this was that I saw the movie first, which prevented me from forming my own view of the characters - I kept picturing Brad Pitt, Ed Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, and Meat Loaf. I guess I'll have to go read Chuck Palahniuk's other books before they make movies of them. So if you haven't seen the movie, read this first.
0783229364|5.0|this movie gives some big boom.  sound track is great and that little mike fox is a hunk.  kudos indeed
0060930187|4.0|This is a somewhat autobiographical account by Sylvia Plath&gt; The main character (Esther) dabbles in perfection and suicide before ending up in a mental institiution. It was sad. My only complaint is that in schools, they don't put a lot of emphasis on this book or they just plain ignore it lik eit never existed. &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; should get more credit that it gets and be considered an American classic.
B000002UTT|5.0|I didn't have a CD player when this first came out, so I owned (and quickly wore out) the cassette.  Though I've gone through two CD players by now, I only just got this on CD (lazy me), and it's been played so frequently since I'm glad CDs don't wear out!  Oddly, the cassette didn't have &quot;(I Could Never) Give You Up&quot;, so it was new to me.  I think the lyrics are adorable, and wish they'd do a new, less throwaway version (not likely :-( ).  I like &quot;Dressed For Success&quot;, &quot;Dangerous&quot;, &quot;Cry&quot;, and &quot;Listen To Your Heart&quot; best.  Isn't Marie just amazing?
B00006JLX4|5.0|WOW...What a great collection of songs. Slanted and Enchanted was a landmark, with Pavement going into the lab and splicing the art rock inclinations of bands like Sonic Youth and the Fall with the alt-rock jangle of early REM. Prior to these recordings, Pavement was a two-man operation. They got some college friends, a bass playing vet of the NY music scene, and the older hippy drummer/owner of their local recording studio in Stockton, and came out with arguably best alternative record of the 90's.<br />In 1993 I didn't think that Pavement could write a bad song if they tried. Slanted and Enchanted and the other amazing songs collected here were just too good. And as good as their newer  records were, there's a wonderful edge between pop and noise to these recordings that they never quite matched afterwards. (My guess is that the crazy but brilliant original drummer Gary Young was more vital to their sound than they might have us believe.)<br />Most of the \\"extra\\" songs here were pretty difficult to come by before this came out. Some highlights for me are \\"So Stark\\", \\"Shoot the Singer\\", and \\"Trigger Cut\\", but the whole thing, from beginning to end, is one long highlight. If lo-fi and distorted guitars don't turn you off, or if you have wondered what all the fuss about Pavement was about, do yourself a favor and pick up this version of S+E with the extra songs.<br />Matador Records should be commended for putting this out.
B000002UWP|4.0|Another album I owned and wore out on tape long ago, but only recently bought on CD.  It's not as good, I think, as their first album, but all Marie's ballads are gorgeous (as usual), and I also really like &quot;Fading Like a Flower&quot; and &quot;Church of Your Heart&quot;.  But &quot;Things Will Never Be the Same&quot; got a bad treatment on this album, so you'll want the much more beautiful version on &quot;Tourism&quot;.
B00003CX8Y|1.0|My family was really looking forward to the release of this DVD.  When we played the movie for the first time we were horrified by the poor picture quality.  The prominent horizontal black lines completely ruin the anticipated DVD EXPERIENCE.  The image quality is far worse than my daughter's most abused VHS video.  I would not recommend this as a DVD buy.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Film making rarely reaches this level.  While many were dissapointed in Part 3,the final install ment of triologies (think Star Wars) often pale in comparison.  The middle segments are usually the strongest. If 1 &amp; 2 didn't exist, critics would have been kinder to 3.  Copolla seems to want to tie up the loose ends when in reality those ends still dangle before us and tantillize us even today (think Sopranos).<br />The DVD set is well constructed and vast;ly superior to the 25th Aniv.

0446310786|5.0|This is an extremely well-written classic that addresses several different, timeless issues. Initially, it is about two children discovering the sometimes harsh realities of their world. A little deeper, this book is about 1 man defending another, unjustly accused man, against the wrath of a town. On yet another level, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" provides a realistic look at prejudice, racism, and injustice through the innocent eyes of a young girl.
B00005JKYI|1.0|I have the laser disc version of Footloose, and I was hoping to obtain the DVD version in order to have better video and sound quality. Unfortunately, the video quality was horrible. There was a dark yellow cast over the picture. My laser disc copy has slightly less resolution than a typical DVD, but has beautiful color and contrast. I do not what happened to cause the video defect, but I suggest people should avoid this particular DVD version.
B00005JKDR|4.0|Although this movie appears to have been designed for children, I have noticed that it is a big favorite among college students (both male and female). Two floors of girls from one residence hall even got together and had a movie night in one of the lounges just so that they could watch it!
0425170349|5.0|I listen to the audiotape/s read by David Duke and i must say that Duke did Clancy well.  I first became familiar with Duke with the audiotape/s of Plum Island.  I knew that I would love Clancy read by Duke.  Thanks Duke for not disappointing me.<br />Rainbow Six is a thrilling story about rescuing the good guys and retiring (killing) the bad guys.  The Navy Seals come to mind when I think about the types of rescues that were featured in this book.  I am glad that I did not have to  read this book as 700 pages would have been a bit much.   I hearby recommend to all the readers of books. if you feel as I do about good but lengthy  books, get the audiotape/s instead.
0064407667|5.0|This is a great book, and I reccomend this series to most people, because it's got humor, suspense, action, and mystery all slamed into one series. The whole series is about these three children, Violet, the oldest who is 14 and loves to invent things. Klaus, 11, loves to read books about anything. Sunny, the youngest, about 12 months old, likes to bite things, anything really. Their family is VERY wealthy. So anyway, the series is about these three children and their unfortunate events that occur after their parents die in from a fire that happened at their house, and they meet a horrible person who keeps going after their fortune. You'll have to find out what happens in the 9 book series.
B000001FSP|5.0|Although the boundaries have shifted in the decades since this album's release, Broken English has lost none of its trenchant appeal. And despite Courtney Love and many angry grrrl groups using explicit lyrics, Why d'Ya Do It? still sounds fresh, perhaps because it originally was written as a poem by Heathcote Williams. Her version of Lennon's Working Class Hero sounds as sharp as ever, while the brooding title track is still relevant today. On the melodic side, Lucy Jordan has become quite a standard and could easily be considered a country weepie, while Witches Song remains eerie and anthemic. The sound is typical 80's rock with tight musicianship supporting this classic monument to decadence and despair. This is probably her best selling album of all time for all the wrong reasons! The other two works from the same period, A Child's Adventure and Dangerous Acquaintances, are equally excellent and will richly reward the listener. Nevertheless, Broken English stands tall as a masterpiece of broken taboos, subversive poetics and timeless songs.
B000050XEI|5.0|What else can be said about this remarkable artist?!  Enya continues to present original, graceful beauty in musical form unheard of since the compositions of early classical artists.  I've been a fan of her's since 1989, and never tire of her consistently original works.  As a previous poster indicated, her sound is established and identifies closely to her.  Stereotype?  Unlikely, considering Enya delivers a distinctly inimitable sound to each of her pieces.<br />Commencing with the poetic instrumental \\"Day Without Rain,\\" the flowing piano manages to convey its significance with trickling keys, airy strings, and drifting (almost inaudible, but effectual) echoes, setting the mood of this entire album.  The composition \\"Tempus Vernum,\\" commences quite omniously only to graduate into a blissful and an enchanting piece, synonymous with the sun appearing after a rainy storm.  The rest of this CD is just as marveling and pleasant to hear.  Not too dissimilar to her previous albums, \\"A Day Without Rain\\" includes another instrumental piece with waltz-oriented songs sung in Latin and her native Celtic language. <br />It is interesting the composition \\"Only Time\\" became synonymous in remembering the events of September 11th (the album was coincidentally released months prior).  Though truly a remarkable piece, the song only enhanced its somber brillance with being identified with one of the most tragic days in American (and world) history.  Whether recalling those unmentionable events or becoming embraced as an original piece, \\"Only Time\\" alone will remain entrenched as a musical moniker for remembrance for years to come . . . .<br />\\"A Day Without Rain\\" continues to display Enya's profound and elegant style that will echo timelessly into the coming decades.  Absolutely graceful!
6305181772|5.0|Twists and turns comprise the movement of this film.  Action, suspense, intregue and intensity make the movie go by fast.  Could Cruise be planning a series like the James Bond series?  Certainly the Mission Impossible theme lends itself to a sequel.  First rate film.  A+
0743442539|5.0|John Le Carre (David Cornwell) took the espionage novel away from the ridiculous and campy world of James Bond and the Man from U.N.C.L.E. and made it into serious literature with this, his third published novel.<BR>Readers may be struck by how bleak Le Carre's world is in this book. The story, Alec Leamas, a veteran agent goes on his last mission into the Zone (East Germany) in an effort to combat the East German intelligence (The Abteilung) from discovering a deeply planted British agent. Le Carre's staple character, George Smiley makes an appearance here, but it's Leamas who dominates the book. He's angry and cynical, but a dedicated agent. The other characters, Liz, Fiedler and Mundt are also wonderfully drawn and believeable. Le Carre keeps the plot moving without sacrificing his characters (sometimes difficult to do in the thriller genre). The result is a deeply felt, wonderfully written thriller. The final twist (if you're smart, you'll figure it out) is very satisfying and reveals the hypocrisy of the Communists and Western Powers and the callous regard for human life and dedication to one's cause. A core of high intelligence runs through this novel, yet you never have to reread passages to find out what happened. It's beautifully written and highly controlled. Le Carre is in total control of the reader and we're seduced by his dazzling prose. The most amazing thing is forty years later with the end of the Cold War, this ageless work still holds up. It has gone from a commentary piece to historical literature and retains it's power. What more can be said for a classic than that? <br />I noticed that Cliff's Notes has a companion to this work. That, I think shows what a classic Mr. Cornwell has penned. It's that good. This is a novel to read, digest and ponder.
0345413377|5.0|A masterpiece, I didn't let anyone persuade me otherwise! The Amber Spyglass is wonderful, probably better than the 2nd one. Of course I read all the books in order, and that is a very good idea to do with this trilogy.<br />  \\"Actually if people think that books are only for those who already agree with them, then they don't deserve books,\\" this was a quote from Phillip Pullman, and I must say that I quite agree. These books were wonderful, every single one, even though I do believe strongly in God. Remember its fiction! I really do love these books, and look forward to his others. The ending is a little (very) disappointing in my opinion but I can live with it, and it makes the story different, than if it was turned into a fairy tale, that's not his style anyway. I can see why he ended it that way, and it does fit, even if it isn't perfect. \\"The basic theme of the story, which of course is the difference between innocence and experience,\\" another quote from the great Phillip Pullman. I encourage anyone with an open mind to read not only the Amber Spyglass but all of these books! Lyra and Will had a very interesting adventure throughout this book and I'm glad I read it and hope you will be too!
0380733358|5.0|Ken Follett established himself in the thriller genre with this novel, first published in 1978. It was an instant bestseller and later made into a movie with Donald Sutherland and Kate Nelligan. <br />The premise: Henry Faber (codename: \\"Die Nadel\\") an individualistic and ruthless German agent (one of the last German spies not scooped up by MI5) is assigned to investigate whether or not Lt. General Patton's First United States Army Group is massing in East Anglia for the expected invasion of Calais, the area the German High Command expects the Allies to assault. Faber discovers that Patton's Army is a phony. The Allies are deceiving German intelligence with fake messages, troop concentrations and dummy barracks (which look real to German reconnaisance aircraft).<br />However careful as Faber is, the British counterintelligence agents Percival Godliman and Fred Bloggs, a history professor and policeman respectively, are a brilliant team that discover \\"Die Nadel\\" and are hot on his trail.<br />Eluding the police and the Home Guard and killing any and all who suspect his identity, Faber heads north to make a rendezvouz with a U-boat. His escape is thwarted by bad weather and he is washed ashore on Storm Island, a nearly deserted piece of rock in the North Sea, where Lucy Rose, a beautiful, but frustrated wife of a legless RAF pilot lives. In time, she discovers Faber's true identity....<br />I don't usually like thrillers, but this one kept me up. I read it over 20 years ago and have read it a few times since. Follett is a good story teller and his research for the story is wonderful. His portrayals of the German leaders, Hitler, Rundstedt and Rommel are superb.<br />I liked the film version too, though I believe it would be ideal for a remake (my choices for Faber would be Ralph Fiennes and for Lucy Kate Winslett or Helena Bonham Carter).<br />Time hasn't dimmed this book. It still holds up and is a classic of World War II espionage. Enjoy.
B000022TSV|5.0|As a film it is the best. Placido Domingo, by far my favorite tenor, sings an incredibly convincing Don Jose. Julia Migenes Johnson, nevertheless, does not sing a suitable Carmen. Raimondi and Esham are good in the supporting roles of Escamillo and Micaela. The movie was filmed on location in Spain, and the atmosphere, complete with large crowd scenes, gravel streets, cathedrals and a bullfight arena, makes a perfect setting. As a film this movie is exceptional. If you look closely, you will see how effectively Bizet's music is played to symbolic scenes. For example, the Overture is played in the first part of the film as we see Escamillo kill his first bull. Appropriately, the ominous Fate theme, which prophetizes the murder and death that is to come at the end of the opera, is played as a funeral procession carries a large idol of the Virgin Mary. Ironically, Carmen herself is in that scene, barely visible among the crowds. Faith Esham holding a Bible, strengthened by her love for Don Jose, sings the most beautiful version of \\"Je Dis Que Rien\\" amid a rocky, dangerous landscape of canyons, as she embarks upon a dangerous world of smugglers and duelists she is unfamiliar with, that has become the home of the roaming Carmen, Jose and the contrabandiers. The final scene, in which Carmen confronts Don Jose, making it clear that she does not love him and has turned her affection to Escamillo (the only portion Migenes Johnson sings incredibly well), behind the bullfight stadium. Appropriately enough, Don Jose stabs Carmen just as Escamillo has slayed his bull. It is a metaphor for the free-spirited Carmen herself, who is as untamed as a bull and slain by Don Jose, the one man who wanted to dominate her out of his obscessive love. Excellent film. A must see, if anything for the splendor of Placido Domingo's remarkable tenor voice. Five Stars Nevertheless.
B000001EL3|5.0|This CD was just what Kiss needed coming off the success of Alive !  While Detroit Rock City and Beth are the best known tracks here, the standouts to me are King of the Nighttime World, God of Thunder, and Do You Love Me.  A very strong CD and a good place to start for new Kiss fans.
B00005UW7G|5.0|What could be more perfect ? Mozart's masterpiece made into a movie ? An excellent orchestra conducted by Lorin Maazel, performances by Ruggero Raimondi (Don Giovanni), Jose Van Daam (Leporello), Edda Moser (Donna Ana), Teresa Berganza (Zerlina) and the great Kiri Te Kenawa as Donna Elvira. The movie was filmed in Italy, as closest to Seville, Spain as we can get in the opera world, is beautiful to look at, effectively festive in Don Giovanni's masquerade ball scene and hellishly frightening in the Commandatore Scene. Everyone knows the story, and shame on you, if you don't. Don Giovanni is the legendary womanizer, boasting from the opera's first act that he has bedded hundreds and hundreds of women. His decadent days are apparently over, for throughout the opera he fails at his attempts to seduce (Dona Ana whom he attempts to rape and in the process kills her father the Commandatore who will come back from the dead to extract his vengeance, Zerlina the young, newly engaged peasant girl and the one woman who truly loves him, Donna Elvira, he wants nothing to do with. This opera is beautifully performed, masterfully performed and the vocal talents are exceptional; particularily on the part of the women. Edda Moser as the wronged Dona Ana is touching (Edda Moser sang the role of the Queen of the Night in Mozart's Magic Flute with the Bavarian State Orchestra conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch, and considering her intensely Wagnerian style in that performance, this is a lyrical stray for her), Teresa Berganza sings a gorgeous Zerlina, passive, easily seduced, and of course, there is the great Kiri Te Kenawa, a diva in her own right, who sings Donna Elvira very convincingly. As for the men, all are brilliant. Raimondi as the Don is the greatest. He IS the seventeenth century infamous playboy, dark, handsome and libertine, and his final scene with the Commandatore who sends a legion of demons to drag him into hell is a triumph. Jose Van Daam touches us with comic brilliance as his man servant Leporello. This is the greatsest Don Giovanni ever produced. Five Stars all the way. You must have this film and on DVD it's a magnificent experience.
6304806434|5.0|Great action film, another triumph for Nicolas Cage.  Cage plays Cameron Poe, a former Army Ranger who goes to prison for involuntary manslaughter and on the way home happens to be on a flight with the worst set of criminals assembled in one place since the Manson family.  Of course the poor law enforcement officers lose control of the flight and that's where the fun starts.  A great thrill ride, well worth repeat viewings.
B00000I3JO|5.0|Originally released in 1989 as a brilliant transition away from the more eighties sound of the Scottish band, this beautiful work by the band led by the extraordinary singer Paul Buchanan simply stands up there with a few privileged albums that one can hear once and again, while sipping a good scotch or a nice glass of wine, with the lights off, while overlooking the city skyline with the breeze hitting you in the face. Graphical enough? Well, the truth is that this album constitutes (in my humble opinion) The Blue Nile's most brilliant musical accomplishment.<br /><br />Perhaps the reason why the album fits so well the nighttime has to do, not only with the downbeat tempo it carries, but also with the recurrent theme of \\"night\\" and \\"light\\" all accross the songs. One of the most exquisite songs and my personal favorite was one whose reincarnation made it to the soundtrack of 'Six Feet Under' where Buchanan and Craig Armstrong perform a new arrangement of it. I am talking about \\"Let's Go Out Tonight.\\"<br /><br />Please do yourself a favor and grab a copy of this album. The only bad thing it has is that it only has seven songs, which makes it every bit as enjoyable as an aged drink to go with it. ;)
6305546789|5.0|This is the top of the line as far as horror movies go in my opinion.  This is the movie that started my enjoyment of the horror and terror genre.  Well written story that builds Michael Myers as a truly disturbed psychopath, and the low body count adds to the chill factor, as you wonder \\"Will he kill them now ?\\", as he stalks the teens around Haddonfield.  Strong debut by Jamie Lee Curtis, she became as much an icon as Michael has based on this film.  If you want to know where to start as far as horror films go, start here.  It doesn't get any better than this.
B000002UR7|4.0|Pablo Honey is not one of Radiohead's later, more complex, and what their egotistical &quot;true fans&quot; like to call their most &quot;intellectual&quot; album. Big deal. Get over it. I love Kid A and OK Computer just as much as anyone else, but Radiohead had to start somewhere and Pablo Honey seems just the perfect place. I've heard that the band regrets writing numerous tracks off of here, particularly &quot;Creep&quot; because it gave people the wrong impression and almost took their careers in a direction they didn't want to go in, but it is undeniable that this album rocks with the best of the 90's alternative. It's been categorized as grunge or &quot;grunge rehash&quot; but in my opinion this album doesn't have very much to do with the genre of grunge, except maybe for the time it was released. Opinions may vary, but to me grunge is a harder, often darker and more aggressive style of rock than what has been put on Pablo Honey. The material on here is much more mellow than the mood I usually put with Nirvana, Stone Temple Pilots old albums, Soundgarden, and Alice In Chains, and the music, especially the guitars are a lot less aggressive and driven as these grunge artists. Just because it's mellow though, that doesn't mean that it doesn't rock out.<br />&quot;Creep&quot;, as much as some fans hate it, remains a favorite of mine with the laidback clean guitars picking along one moment and then the distorted slashings taking over the next. It is truly an anthem poster child song for the 90's. &quot;You&quot; also opens the album with high expectations and a great melody you can sing right along to. &quot;Ripcord&quot;, &quot;Vegetable&quot;, &quot;Blow Out&quot;, and &quot;Lurgee&quot; also soar while &quot;Thinking About You&quot;, &quot;Anyone Can Play Guitar&quot;, and &quot;I Can't&quot; are on the softer strummed side. It's a perfect balance and a great album to just close your eyes and feel the music. It also shows how unfortunate it is that mainstream rock couldn't stay on this well blazened path and had to go in the horrendous direction of Puddle Of Mudd. Ugh. Words can't describe the pain I feel.<br />So I thank all the Radiohead fans who can truly appreciate this album for the great record it is, and to all those who think its not intellectual enough, get off your horse. That only proves how boring you really are.
B0000399WI|5.0|This one isn't for the squeamish.  Typical story of innocent man accused of murder going to prison, then it all becomes very realistic.  Tim Robbins does a very believable and effective job in this film, as does Morgan Freeman, as the con long denied parole who finds that being brutally honest can be a good thing.  Not recommended for younger viewers, as there are several disturbing parts, but a great film for mature viewers.
B000066F6H|1.0|I was looking through the reviews of this album and noticed that there were too few one-star reviews.  This band deserves 10,000 one-star reviews.  Their little cocky attitudes and the fact that nobody in the band wrote the lyrics makes this pop garbage.  It doesn't matter if it doesn't sound like Britney or Aguilera, they are just part of another faction of horrible pop.
6305971099|4.0|This movie took the Halloween franchise off the beaten path a bit. The psychic link was an unnecessary addition, just having Jamie freak out a bit would have worked, after all she is Michael Myers' niece, and that would be enough to deal with.  Good action though, Michael continues to lower the teenage population of Haddonfield as usual.  The man in black showed promised, as after all it could have been a woman (Laurie) just as easily and left open a lot of possibilities.  All in all, an enjoyable entry in the Halloween series.
0201633612|5.0|If I choose the best computer science reference I have read,<BR>I don't hesitate to pick up this book.<BR>This book is great: nice introduction about OO, good format..<br />Just buy it, and read, read, read.<br />I alway read this book before starting design new software.<br />thanks a lot, GOF.
B000059TPN|5.0|Great action film.  The battle between the SEALs and the hired guns came off great, the chase through San Francisco was also quite dynamic.  To me, the best part of the film was the tour viewers get to see of Alcatraz itself.  Granted, some of the areas may not exist and were added for storyline purposes, but I enjoyed getting to see so much of the infamous old prison.  Nicolas Cage does a great job as Stanley Goodspeed, and any action movie with Sean Connery should be strong as well.  Highly recommended.
0441003257|4.0|The type of humor here is VERY Douglas Adams-like. Terrifically funny. If you like Mr. Adams or Monty Python, you'll find this book very entertaining.
6305531374|4.0|Jamie Lee Curtis returns to the series that made her a star and the results are very good.  After the events of Halloween and Halloween II, Laurie moves to California and changes her name.  However, no one can escape Michael !  Who needs AAA, call Michael for directions as he makes the trip from Illinois to Califoria seem like a drive to the mall.  This is a very good movie, but as in all of the movies, there are things that could have been better, such as some mention as to what happened to Jamie, or maybe she wasn't really born since this installment ignores parts 4-6, as well as part 3 (which we ALL should ignore).  Overall, a great return to the series for Jamie Lee and an enjoyable movie.
0446607274|5.0|This is a very very good book...In my opinion, COnnelly's best book since the excellent &quot;The Concrete Blonde&quot; (although not QUITE as good...)<br />The plot is excellent, and it moves with great pace. It's exciting, well constructed, and a mystery to the last. Connelly just carries on pulling surprises out of the bag right through the book. <br />Bosch is on fine form, although i seemed to get the sense that he's mellowing a little...(although, upon the ending, that notion was dispelled slightly!) The developments in his relationship with Eleanor are surprisingly moving, and i woudl like to read a lot more about that side of his personal life...<br />This is a first-class crime novel, in line with some of the best in the genre. (Which is encouraging for me to say, as i was rather disappointed and, frankly, a bit bored, by his last Bosch, Trunk Music.)<br />you want my advice, you read this book.
0446677450|2.0|This is a book about financial knowledge. Kiyosaki tries to explain, in simple terms what he has learnt about accumulating wealth. The general thrust of the book is put your money into assets (anything that makes you money) and try to limit your liabilities (anything that drains money from your account).<br />I like the book because it is concise, easy to read and easy to understand. In theory the ideas presented are very sound. However, the book falls over by failing to provide practical examples of how to apply the knowledge. Correction, the book does provide specific examples of what the author himself has done to accumulate wealth. Unfortunately, many of the examples rely on various loopholes in United States taxation law and being from Australia, the examples were not applicable to my situation.<br />My main problem with the book is that it says \\"Put all your money into things that will make you money\\" and leaves it at that. It gives general examples such as shares and real estate but does not delve into something more specific that is broadly applicable to most readers.<br />I do wholeheartedly agree with some of the basic principles in the book such as \\"A good education and a good job is no longer enough\\". For this my rating is elevated to three stars.<br />Update - here's another interesting 'review' of the book:...<br />Update 2 - I couldn't post the actual link so here are some examples of gross factual inaccuracies in this book<br />Kiyosaki:<br />A corporation can do so many things that an individual cannot. Like pay for expenses before it pays taxes.<br />Truth: <br />Both corporations and sole proprietors pay expenses before they pay taxes. Sole proprietors pay taxes only on the net income of their businesses, which means after expenses.<br />Kiyosaki:<br />Says friend did a tax-free exchange from a sole-proprietorship rental house to a mini-storage limited partnership. <br />That is explicitly prohibited by Internal Revenue Code Section 1031(a)(2)(B,C,D). Errors like this cause me to marvel at the fact that Kiyosaki's co-author is a CPA.<br />Kiyosaki:<br />Simple math and common sense is [sic] all that is needed to do well financially.<br />Truth:<br />The world is full of non-wealthy people who can do simple math and have common sense. Many additional qualities are needed to succeed in business.<br />After some further reflection I can only revise my rating to two stars.
0395389496|4.0|In his introduction to his selection of ghost stories, Roald Dahl notes just how hard it is to create a true classic in children's literature. Out of the hundreds to thousands of children's books written every year, maybe one or two (in a good year) retain a large audience. The Polar Express is one of these rare volumes--and deservedly so.<br />Chris Van Allsburg's holiday classic is full of lovely illustrations. One can feel the chill of a long ago Christmas Eve, the warmth of the inside of the train, the vastness of the Polar landscape. Yet, the real attraction with The Polar Express is its timeless, haunting story. Like the last echoing strains of the sweetest ringing bell, this story will stay with you long after you are done reading.<br />With all the \\"stuff\\" that has come to surround and obscure Christmas--this story, of a boy who finds wonder in the face of surrounding disbelief, is a perfect book to read during the season.<br />I give it my full recommendation.
B000001F3C|5.0|War is, as many have already said, U2's angriest album. Except for All That You Can't Leave Behind, this album also is the most reliant on distortion in most parts. This may make it seem like a 'heavy' U2 album. Trust me, it's not metal by any means, and it's too polished to be punk. It's just top-notch political rock. One person mentioned that U2 were like the System Of A Down of the 80's. I'll up the ante and say that SOAD are a great band, but don't come close to U2.<br />The hits \\"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\\" and \\"New Year's Day\\" are here. Listening to them, I can attest to smirking widely as I hear the passion in Bono's voice. I can imagine The Edge's fingers flying across the fretboard, Adam plucking his bass strings maniacally, and Larry pounding away, clearly an underrated drummer of his time and age. I smirk because it's obvious why the two songs were hits. It's also funny that they encompass elements of almost every successful alternative/moderate rock song of the past decade. War was released in 1983. These guys were too ahead of their time.<br />Even better than the singles are the other tracks. Just like any U2 album, War should be enjoyed in its entirety, for its brutal honesty. The feeling and emotion behind this album weighs heavier upon the listener than the most brutal death metal album, and the fury stings worse than any hip-hop cuss-fest. That's what makes this album classic. U2 forever.
6305280762|1.0|when your 8 years old, and they have the movie at the walk-in FOX theatre, and it's in Dolby like EARTHQUAKE was, it is a great and scary movie, you've got your flicks and your popcorn and your orange coke, but when your 37, and the trade center towers have just blown up, it becomes a really stupid movie.

B00004XPP0|5.0|This is the classic Epic Tale.  Not a book (well actually it is) but it is absolutely classic film.  The first was Oscar Nominated for Best Picture but lost to Annie Hall.  Buy these now!
B000002HPT|4.0|When I first put this on, despite already being in the knowledge that it was fairly different from other Dream Theater albums (I already owned all the others besides Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulance and Change Of Seasons), I was very surprised. And unlike my first listen to every other Dream Theater release I had before, I wasn't immediately impressed.<br />However, that's mostly because of the different sound. Dream Theater definately are not metal on this album. So for a metalhead like me it is obviously going to take a bit more time to get used to the sound. The truth is that this album contains some great stuff - New Millenium and Lines In The Sand particularly. There are some more mainstream songs (such as You Not Me and Hollow Years for example) but its not as if they dominate the album. And it does have to be said that with a few exeptions on other albums (such as Through Her Eyes and Wait For Sleep for example), Dream Theaters most touching and, dare I say it, beautiful songs are on this album. Does that make them pop? Far from it.<br />As for being a sell-out, well its a fair enough statement to make in some respects. They had just released Awake (by far their heaviest album at that point) and Falling Into Infinity remains to be their softest, for lack of a better word. But has anyone heard of grunge? That heavy sound was very popular in the early to mid 90s? And when was Awake released? In 1994. A coincidence? Maybe. But also maybe not. Not dissing Awake coz I love that album, and I definately prefer it to this one. But I'm simply making a point that no-one else seems to have picked up on - if FII was conforming to mainstream rock then why wasn't Awake conforming to the heavier sound that popular at the time (which, incidentally, is mocked in Let Me Breath - love that line about eMpTyV though!)? In my mind, there are far too many &quot;prog&quot; moments and long song structures (3 songs here are over 8 minutes long, 2 of which are over 12 - not to mention the likes of Hell's Kitchen and Peruvian Skies which are very dark and non-mainstream) to make this mainstream.<br />In conclusion, this isn't my favourite Dream Theater album, nor is it the most impressive on first listen or the most technical.

0385505833|4.0|I had just finished reading Texas by James A. Michener and was looking for something light and fluffy to read. Skipping Christmas fit the bill nicely.  It is a quick read and has some very funny moments.  I also appreciated that Grisham kept the language fairly clean.<br />Like others, I think this book is overpriced. I recommend getting it from a used bookstore or checking it out of the library.
B00003003R|3.0|Although I am not a huge Guns N Roses fan, I knew and owned a fair amount of their material in one form or another. I was not intending to buy this album since I have the majority of the songs already (they are largely drawn from the Appetite and Illusion albums). But my guitar teacher lent me this saying how good it was.<br />Guns N Roses have a very good reputation for putting on a show and I was very interested to see how some of their songs would sound live. However, while this is a good album in itself, I do not feel it quite captures the feeling of a Guns N Roses show, or at least not as much as the live pictures in the sleve do.<br />All in all, the performance is simply average. Axl sounds alright live but for most of songs here his voice lacks the character that it has on the records. The band do not play with nearly the same tightness or precaution. Sometimes they even sound bored especially Izzy when he sings on Dust And Bones. I do not feel that a live albums should be drawn from 50 shows and if its live, then it should be raw. But quite frankly I am a bit disappointed because the mighty force does not sound too mighty here. For the most part, they simply sound like another rock band. I also fail to see how You're Crazy, Estranged and Yesterdays (which are good songs in themsleves) are on here when Civil War, Coma and Think About You have been left out - maybe that's just me but Civil War is an anthem and deserves to be on any Guns N Roses album.<br />My definition of a great live album is one that makes you think \\"God, I wish I was there\\". One where the performance blows away a studio album you never thought could be bettered. This isn't Iron Maiden's \\"Live After Death\\", Slayers \\"Decade Of Aggression\\" or AC/DC's \\"Live!\\". Those albums are performed well, have a great audience atmosphere and leave you picking your jaw up off the floor. This simply doesn't. It is good and contains some great songs, but most, if not all these songs sound better in the studio. Only buy this if you want a compilation. If you are new then the songs are a good intro but will not impress you as much as the studio albums, and if you already own 2 or 3 GnR albums, you simply don't need it. It seems this album was released by Geffen just to milk a bit of money before all the rock bands on their label completely disappeared.<br />... \\"live albums can be either absolutely brilliant or absolutely [bad]\\".

0394800184|5.0|This is, in my opinion, one of the greatest books to start a young child on the path toward a life-long love of reading.  I remember this book from my own childhood (30+ years ago), and I have read it to all three of my own children when they were each under the age of two.  <br />I have always introduced my children to this book with a \\"dramatic reading.\\"  This touch of theatre comes complete with flapping wings, animal noises and a loud, unexpected \\"SNOOOOOORT!\\" which brings forth peals of giggles from the children and requests for encores.<br />It is a simple story, with simple and few words, but the pictures are what truly inspire my children.  The illustrations are animated and humorous and draw the attention of the children to such a degree that they can sit alone with the book and become engrossed in the pictures!  (A great tool for nap time.)
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Ah, I can remember seeing this the first time in a dark, cold theater with my mom and grandma. I remember masquerading as Belle two years later for Halloween. I remember all the hours I spent singing along to a cassette I recorded from the film.<br />Good times.<br />Everyone knows the story of Beauty and the Beast. Belle is a beautiful French girl with the big dreams and caring nature. Sought by the macho egotist Gaston, Belle is heralded as one of the most gorgeous women in the town. But does this effect Belle? Of course not. Belle is sweet, caring, and as intelligent as they come. Could Gaston, who looks through her book one day and declares &quot;But there aren't any pictures!&quot; ever be an appropriate match for sensitive Belle?<br />As animated characters go, one must admit she's an inspiration.<br />Belle's father, Maurice, is the slightly odd town inventor. He is on his way to the fair to show off his newest creation, a wood-chopping machine, when he is dragged off to beast's castle. <br />When Belle shows up looking for Beast, it's obvious her stay isn't going to be conventional. There are talking teapots, candlesticks, and even clocks! <br />After agreeing to take her father's place as Beast's prisoner, the viewer is hooked. The beauty of the film is that it's most certainly not a conventional animated love story. Beast isn't much of a gem in comparison to Cinderella's prince, after all.<br />The design is incredibly pleasing. The splendor of the old, spooky, almost completely abandoned castle only adds to the intrigue that is Beauty and the Beast. From armoires jumping around choosing your wardrobe all the way up to the deteriorating fabrics and floors that make up Beast's chambers.<br />It's eye candy, no doubt. The DVD format is slightly less visually appealing because of 'enhancements' made to the film with computer technology. Colors are less true in places.<br />Despite all of the above, what makes the film timeless is the soundtrack. From the opening song through &quot;Beauty and the Beast,&quot; right up until the closing number, the instrumentals are outstanding and the songs are outstanding. They have bearing outside the film, away from Beast's gloomy world.<br />The DVD is an exceptional bet for the B&amp;B enthusiast. It includes a 'personality' test (Ah, I'm officially Belle!), hours of bonus footage, celebrity commentary, the original music video with Celine Dion and a few interactive games. (Two or three, I believe)<br />They wrote &quot;Human Again&quot; into the film. For those of you who've seen the Broadway version, you'll of course know how clever this song is. I was quite disappointed with the animated rendition, however. The animation is choppy, uncreative, and perhaps even cliched. I'll admit I liked hearing it sung by the original film cast, but I wasn't impressed with their attempt to squeeze it into the film. It's worth hearing once or twice, but it's not as good as I'd hoped.<br />Of course, they included the original version Theatrical Release in here for me, so I can't complain.<br />I would VERY HIGHLY recommend buying this. It's a 90s film essential for all ages. Your kids will love it and I have a feeling you'll enjoy it more than you'll let on.
B00003CX8Y|1.0|This movie is less than par, in fact not even sub par.  Leave it to disney to ruin a timeless classic such as this story.  The animation is very very poor, the acting is regrettable, and the sound and picture quality are that of an old worn out tape.
B00005JKWJ|2.0|In Blade II, the Daywalker joins forces with those he hunts to stop a new evil that threatens both.  With a few added details, that's it, really.<br />I didn't really enjoy Blade II as much as I did its predecessor.  Partly this is because I have a hard time believing the cosmology of the Blade altiverse, which takes a lot of what is commonly accepted about the nature of vampires and throws it out the window.  Now, this wouldn't bother me if what replaced the common knowledge made sense, but it often doesn't, and what you're left with is a lot of internal discontinuity and illogic where it seems the filmmakers ignored their own rules or made up new ones to suit themselves whenever the old ones got in the way.<br />Another reason I didn't enjoy this flick as much was the style of the film-making itself. There was something odd about the lighting, particularly in the early parts of the movie, that made the film just plain hard to see.  It was dark and monochromatic in a way that my eyes and brain just couldn't deal with.  It actually reminded me very much of a low resolution video game, and was just as annoying.<br />The action and fight sequences were also treated poorly, with the camera leaping around so much that you just couldn't see enough of the martial arts to appreciate them, or even tell what was going on at times.  I prefer it when martial arts sequences are filmed from a still camera;  when the hero's doing an amazing crab kick I want to see it, not suddenly be looking down the villain's ear.  Here, too, the lighting did the action a disservice.  One early fight sequence that could have been quite interesting was filmed in front of a bank of floodlights so bright that the action was totally lost;  others were swallowed in shadow or overpowered by weird reflections.<br />On the other hand, there were several good things about this movie.  I always like Wesley Snipes, Ron Perlman was chilling as Blade's antagonist, and Kris Kristofferson was worth bringing back from the dead.  The costumes and makeup were pretty good (although the latter did have overtones of \\"Buffy\\") and the effects were well done.  The script, although a little predictable, was for the most part pretty good, presenting a story that made sense and held together well.  All these things went a long way to redeeming a movie that could have been a total dud, but still didn't make it as good as the original.<br />Worth Renting on your next movie might.back from the dead.

B00005JKDR|5.0|This is a wonderful collection, containing a great transfer of a film that's both funny and sweet, coupled with another disc full of great extras.<br />First off, disc 1 contains both widescreen and fullscreen presentations of the film. Hats off to the DVD creators for showing examples of the differences between the two, and for making widescreen the default selection. If you haven't been watching your DVDs in widescreen, then you've been missing half the movie. It should be pointed out, however, that in this case as well as with A Bug's Life, Pixar actually reworked the composition of many scenes in order to make the fullscreen version look better. The fullscreen version contains &quot;bloopers&quot; during the final credits, while the widescreen version does not, but they can also be found on disc 2. I have to say that I am disappointed with the running commentary. It wasn't as informative or entertaining as the ones I had experienced on the Toy Story films. They basically discuss the technical challenges, all of which are also discussed on disc 2. They also describe some fully-rendered scenes that were later deleted (unusual for an animated film), but not all of them are included in the set. That's a bit of a disappointment.<br />There is so much information on disc 2, it's hard to describe. You get wonderful character design sketches, early animation tests, tours of the &quot;sets,&quot; deleted scenes, games, interviews and much, much more. There's really no possible way to get through it all. If you tried it at one sitting, you'd have information overload. Most of the extras are great, while some of it is not as great and a bit redundant. That's bound to happen when this much information is on display.<br />It took way too long for this movie to make it to DVD, but it's worth the wait. There have been many unfair comparisons to Shrek, but this movie and DVD collection is much better in many respects. Not only is it more appropriate for kids, but it can withstand way more repeat viewings. The DVD set itself shows what can be done in terms of content. Disney/Pixar continues to set the standard for DVD presentations of animated films.
6305657939|3.0|I really, really wish I could give this film a higher star rating, but I even debated giving it as many as three. Despite it's being one of my favorite films, I admit that I enjoy it more for the beautiful costumes, sets, scenery and the idea the film presents rather than the film itself.<br />I love *The Thomas Crown Affair* because of the witty banter between Rene Russo and Pierce Brosnan. I love it because of the idea of an insanely wealthy man who nevertheless decides to steal art on the side, as an entertainment (I'm a sucker for films about thieves). I love it  because of the great music that's in it. I love it because of the wealthy lifestyle it represents. And I love it because it's just simply lovely to look at. (There are some breathtaking scenes at the black and white ball, various restaurants, and at Crown's remote island hideaway.)<br />There are, however, NUMEROUS plot flaws, which I preseme are a result of trying to make the plot sufficiently complex as to seem to originate from a genius like Crown. The first couple of times I saw it, I didn't really notice them. Now, however, I identify a new problem with it  practically every time I sit down to watch it.<br />There are several circumstances surrounding the theft of the Monet that just don't really make sense. Why, for example, DOES the heat go up more around the Monet than in the other parts of the museum--that's never really explained. Why do the police assume that the theives lower the security doors to the impressionist wing, when in fact it's the museum staff who lower them AFTER the attempted theft is discovered--that's clearly shown in the film. Also, I don't know much about paintings, but wouldn't folding a canvas in half damage the paint on this amazingly expensive piece that Crown has gone to so much trouble to steal?<br />There are other problems with the movie, as well. The secretary in one of the office scenes announces the same upcoming conference call in \\"fifteen minutes\\" in two different scenes, when more than that amount of time has obvously passed. The Romanians involved with the attempted theft of the Monet are really almost just too thug-ish to be believable. The fact that \\"Yanni doesn't speak English\\" is made far too obvious as they initially enter the museum and ends up seeming like a silly and unnecessary plot device later in the film.<br />Nevertheless--even with all this said--I still love the movie. If you don't look too closely at the dizzying plot, it really isn't bad at all. You should watch it for the reasons I outlined earlier. Watch it because it's beatiful. Watch it because it's just . . . fun.
B000002HRE|5.0|You people are insane, are you the real Metallica fans or are you Dave Matthews Band fans logging on just to dog Metallica? This makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, how dare you people allow a Metallica album to rate only three and a half stars, who do you think you are? I'd like to see you critic wannabes get a band together and go into the studio and try to cut a classic metal album such as this one, I got news, you couldn't do it! It's so easy for you to dog something great when you've probably never picked up an instrument in your life! Metallica is the best band that ever existed and Reload and Load for that matter are two of the best albums ever recorded, and if you have a problem with that, go back and listen to Barry Manilow.
B00006DEFA|5.0|I own a copy of the video, the theater release DVD, the soundtrack, an original poster, and now the director's cut DVD and not one cent spent was excessive. This movie is simply perfect. The superb acting, script, direction,sountrack and cinematography elevated this movie to a very high level of artistic achievement. The main criticism of this movie appears to be the historical inaccuracies about Mozart and Salieri, however the artistic endeavour is more than just holding a mirror up to nature, it also involves distillation and synthesis. Amadeus is not about the man, the mystery nor the murder, it is about the music and the music of Mozart is triumphant and eternal.<br />The Director's cut contains an extra 20 minutes of the movie and while the extra scenes are interesting on several levels, they neither add nor detract from the original theatrical release. The digitally restored print and sountrack, together with the Making of Amadeus make this DVD an absolute must for die hard fans as well as newcomers.
B00005UWBP|4.0|I have to warn, that the MPAA rated this movie PG-13 for Instense science fiction. But when I was watching the movie I caught language going on during the film. About 1 hour and 40 minutes into the movie it was like it was running fast. And then it seemed to have slow down. So anyways, the movie is about a rich man, who builts a park called &quot;Juassic Park&quot; and right before he opens it, he invites a paleontologist/paleobotaninst named Alan Grant (Sam Neil) another paleontologist/paleobotanist  named Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and some more  people including hig grandchildren Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim (Joseph Mazzello). The other people are a mathmatician, and a theorist. There are dinsouars running around the park, and during the trip, the park loses its power. The rason for the / in my review,m is that I don't know for sure who was the paleontologist was.

So how do you like it now.<BR>Of course at the time I belived that without the Smiths -Morrissey would be finished (but I was wrong).  Why do people say that this work was a foreshadowing of Morrissey's solo work, or the end of the Smiths - I don't get that. Despite the fact that listening to this album has always been a sad affair  (because we now knew it was the last) the Smiths are a solid unit trudging forward. I don't think that they felt a break up comming and I don't think the music signals that eventuality.<BR>Anyway, this album as a whole is more accessable than the others (not always a bad thing).  Few albums feel as complete and well rounded as this one - It seems futile to discuss tracks individually when each track is necesary for the understanding and appreciation for the others.  The only thing that never jelled for me w/ this album was the title - it made it seem like there would be more Smiths to come.

0316777722|5.0|My sister recommended this book to me, after she warned me, \\"It's a bit warped, because I dropped it in the bathtub when I was laughing so hard\\"!  ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY is a collection of David Sedaris' autobiographical short stories, which describe his childhood speech problems, his father's obsession with forming a jazz band with his progeny, his move to Paris with his boyfriend, and his attempts to master the art of speaking French while living in France.<br />I've been looking for years for an heir to James Thurber -- someone whose mastery of observation excels at describing everyday incidents without stripping away their intrinsically bizarre nature. I'm pleased to find this heir in David Sedaris, whose short stories are nakedly honest and touchingly fresh.  Sedaris shares things which most of us would not even write in our own private diaries, such as,  \\"Because I am both a glutton and a masochist, my standard complaint, 'That was so bad,' is always followed by 'And there was so little of it!'\\"<br />My favorite stories were \\"Jesus Shaves\\", in which Sedaris attempts to explain American Easter holiday traditions in broken French to many foreign students (and one sadistic teacher) in his French class, and \\"Giant Dreams, Midget Abilities\\", in which Sedaris takes guitar lessons from a midget as part of his father's dream of creating a family jazz band.<br />If you love humor that's as sublime as it is surreal, you'll love ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY. Sedaris and his book may be \\"a bit warped,\\" but it just doesn't get any better than this!
0060934913|5.0|Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential is an unflinching look at life as a cook.  Mr. Bourdain is the head chef at a French Brassiere Les Halles in New York City.  The book takes us on a journey through his culinary life.  He first discovered the true power and sexual experience of food as a teenager on the coast of  France where his fathers family was from and where he spent his summers.  It was there that he ate an oyster that was just plucked from the water and the sensation that it cast over him has never left him.  Mr. Bourdain gives out all the secrets of the restaurant industry on items like never order fish on Mondays, the way cooks prepare meat well-done and the like that will shock some readers.  But the reason Kitchen Confidential succeeds is that Mr. Bourdain himself.  He graphically and openly discusses his personal life which is a myriad of hard drug use, drinking and other personal failures.  The reader connects with him on a personal level and book moves from a mere expose on the restaurant industry into a story about one mans struggles with his demons and how the love of food and making a life out of it provided redemption.
0316666343|4.0|This is one of the few books that I can honestly say kept my attention... I couldn't put it down!  The book is written in first person, from the point of view of the murdered girl, Susie Salmon.  The story gives you a look into the mind of Susie, who is watching the events on Earth from up in heaven.  It shows how one family copes with the loss of their daughter, and how a community copes with the loss of a friend.  It also shows how time is an eventual healer.  The book takes you through the lives of these people, including the murderer himself, and how their lives end up.<br />The only disappointment is the last 10 pages of the book.  I thought that it ended too quickly, and that there wasn't much &quot;closure.&quot;  I felt slightly empty, but for the most part, this book was interesting and will make you think about life and what may come afterwards.

B00006C79E|4.0|After their experimentation with minimalist electronica on Sound of Water -- which raised their beautifully crafted pop to a new level of refinement and subtlety (too subtle, as it turns out, for most Amazon listeners) -- the group seems uncertain on their new album how to proceed, or, indeed, whether to proceed at all. The new record is content mainly to relive the past -- to trigger an earlier memory of the band: the spoken word intros by Michael Jayston recall the dialogue samples on Foxbase Alpha and So Tough; the title track reaffirms the group's aesthetic laid out in their previous pop manifesto `Join Our Club'; `Soft like Me' retreads `Calico' (albeit in a more lumpy version -- this is ABSOLUTELY not an example of innovation as the other review suggests); `Shower Scene' is this year's `Hug My Soul'; `Stop and Think It Over' evokes the sound of Good Humor while the instrumental `Language Lab' evokes Good Humor b-sides; `Action' recapitulates my favorite mix of `He's on the Phone' (`Accident-a-Roma'); \\"The Way We Live Now,' as the title itself suggests, is the latest installment of `How we used to live'; `Summerisle' would almost fit perfectly on the last record -- it just needs To Rococo Rot to further pare away at its structure; `Amateur,' `New Thing,' and `B92' remind one that the group has covered both Gary Numan and Right Said Fred. (Although the charm of those covers was their semi-obscurity - left to be discovered on odds-and-ends collections.) The one true oddity `The More You Know' is the closest they have ever come to rock (Dusty Springfield sings Sonic Youth)  -- until the final flute-driven coda. It is one of the highlights, one of the few moments when the group seems to be looking forward rather than lost in the past.<br />If this were another Japanese collection of A-sides, B-sides and outtakes it would be quite sufficient, possibly fantastic. As the group's new long-player though it is puzzling, a minor disappointment. It really deserves 3 1/2 stars but since this is not an option...rs but since this is not an option...
B00005LC1H|5.0|I would like to state a bit of a paradox:  while I believe MONTY PYTHON'S FLYING CIRCUS to be the greatest television comedy series in the history the medium, I believe FAWLTY TOWERS is the funniest.  With the former, much of the delight is the sheer intellectual or conceptual brilliance of the skits.  There is relatively little that is conceptual or intellectual about FAWLTY TOWERS:  it is a classic situational farce done as perfectly as is possible.  There is none of the self-reflective genius of Monty Python, in with the boys made fun of history, politics, society, the BBC, and the television medium itself.  Instead, we get the most absurdly funny character in the history of TV, one Mr. Basil Fawlty.<br />Of the members of Monty Python, several of the members were verbally brilliant.  Actually, any of the group was capable of saying something utterly off the wall and brilliant.  But John Cleese was the only member of the group who was a truly great physical comedian.  He was the only one who could have performed the Silly Walk.  His greatness as a physical comedian was never greater than in the two FAWLTY TOWERS series.  His disjointed, gangly contortions are perhaps the funniest this side of the double jointed Jim Carrey, and his verbal ripostes are even better than his physical comedy.<br />The cast as a whole is brilliant.  Prunella Scales as Sybil, acutely aware of Basil's absurdities while blithefully ignorant of her own, is the perfect ballast to Cleese's Basil.  Andrew Sachs is always delightful as the linguistically challenged Manuel (\\"Don't mind him, he's from Barcelona\\").  American Connie Booth, co-writer of the series and married to Cleese for most of the series, was solid as Polly, sort of the \\"straight man\\" in the cast.<br />Besides the actors, the key to the series is the utterly brilliant scripts.  In a way, it is a miracle that there were 12 episodes.  Each show was packed with so many bits of verbal brilliance and brilliant conceived guest characters that it would have been impossible to sustain them beyond that number of episodes.<br />I will defend to my dying day MONTY PYTHON as the greatest TV comedy, but as much as I adore it, I have never, ever laughed as hard at anything on TV as at FAWLTY TOWERS.aracters that it would have been impossible to sustain them beyond that number of episodes.  <br />I will defend to my dying day MONTY PYTHON as the greatest TV comedy, but as much as I adore it, I have never, ever laughed as hard at anything on TV as at FAWLTY TOWERS.
B00004XMTC|5.0|To me this is my favourite Bond Film, with My favourite Bond, Sean Connery, he has definitely made a great comeback, better than the rubbish 'Diamonds are Forever' where he was overweight and look slightly bored throughout. Some people critizise him for looking old, but you have to remember that Roger Moore at this stage was too, and he finished his last film at 58 years of age.I prefer this Largo to the one in Thunderball, this one is more smug and sarcastic, a bit like Bond in a way. Barbera Carrera is absolutely gorgeous and sexy as Kim Basinger is too. It is a shmae there isn't any Gun Barrel sequence or Bond theme, but the theme song by Lani Hill is catchy and the starting sequence where Bond comes to rescue a beatiful hostage is great. The climatic scene clould have been better but still there are very many memorable scenes, like bond's Fight with Lippe in Shrublands, very well directed, and of course the Motorcycle chase. This film is much better than some of Connery's earlier ones such as Dr No, You Only Live Twice, Diamonds are Forever and even Thunderball itself. Connery can still do it at 52, who knows he may yet return as James Bond. We'll have to wait and see. This is a film you can see over and over again and i hope it will be made official. Both Connery and Moore have done 7 Bond Films. Do not forget this film should be loved by everyone Bond Fan, don't be put off because it is made by another company.

And I'm a little surprised nobody prior to Steven Spielberg has tried for for a similar formula (cases have been made for Blade Runner and Dark City, though I can't entirely agree).  <br />Minority Report is set in the year 2054, a future that, outside of the roads and constant eye-scans, still visually resembles the present (or the past, in this movie's case). Tom Cruise stars as John Anderton, one of the heads of Pre-Crime, a division in Washington, D.C. that has the ability to stop murders before they happen, thanks to the work of three Pre-Cogs, psychics (two male and one female) permanently placed in a watery bath, delivering info about the future to the Pre-Crime division (just how it's done is revealed in a very clever and tense opening sequence).  <br />Anyway, there's a debate over whether or not Pre-Crime should go national, and it's something that the people are going to vote on.  The creator of this division, Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow), is a bit wary of the FBI agent (Colin Farrell) sent to investigate the way the division operates and the possible infallibilities.  <br />Anderton himself has a bit of a mess in his personal life.  He lost his son six years ago, is divorced, and is addicted to illegal drugs.  But matters grow even worse when the Pre-Cogs' latest vision displays a pre-meditated murder (unsurprisingly stated as a rarity in D.C.) and the killer happens to be Anderton himself!  Going on the run, Anderton struggles to escape his old teammates and discover the truth behind this vision; is it a mistake or a genuine view of a nightmarish destiny?<br />First off, let me say hats off to Steven Spielberg.  The man's always had unfounded criticism tossed at him with virtually every film he's ever made.  It's nice to see he's never dissuaded (or influenced) by such complaints, he's a filmmaker who's always crafted his films with a touch of confidence and genuine emotion that few directors could even hope to achieve in decades worth of work (in case you can't tell, I'm a Spielberg fan, meaning I've just incurred the wrath of David Lynch lovers).   <br />Spielberg's work here is, right off the bat, much unlike anything I've ever seen him do.  Sure, there was A.I., but not a segment in that film resembled Minority Report's opening scenes, a montage of quick-cuts awash in blue colors that builds in both violence and intensity, in spite of the fact this sequence moves backward (meaning the violent act is committed first, then we see what led up to it).  The segment ends with a close-up of an eye, with the camera pulling back to reveal a woman lying in a pool, ominously stating the word, \\"murder.\\"  It's a chilling, daring intro that holds a lot of promise, and instead of disappointing, the rest of the film actually manages to improve upon it.  <br />The future that Spielberg presents here is entirely believable, from both a societal and technological viewpoint.  Most interestingly, when I first saw the previews, I'd expected a \\"Big Brother\\" type society akin to 1984, one in which the government monitored all the actions of the people.  But that's not the case here.  The government presented here questions the ethics and logic behind Pre-Crime because if this were reality, it's a subject matter of serious concern, and not just hive-minded behavior and blather about how this is good for \\"everybody.\\"  Finally, we get a film that features a dark view of the future, but simultaneously gives us reasonable, intelligent characters that realize there are pros and cons to everything.<br />On a dramatic level, Minority Report delivers with as much resonance as A.I., and maybe even better when you factor in just how coherently and cleverlySpielberg and the writers tie all the subplots together.  The emotional baggage is handled mostly by Tom Cruise, who does quite an admirable job; maybe that's an understatement, like the man or not, he delivers one of the best performances I've seen all year.  No one else except for maybe Colin Farrell and Samantha Morton, comes close to Cruise's powerhouse performance, not even Max Von Sydow.  <br />Plot-wise, the film is on solid ground with a few admittedly major stumbles.  One of the movie's narrative burners is the move to make Pre-Crime national, which when you consider the logistics, is almost impossible (3 pre-cogs, an entire country, the cops have to decipher the location through the visual clues; let's face it, you'd need thousands of pre-cogs to pull it off).  (Major spoiler here) The film's big plot twist, while fairly surprising and thought-provoking, doesn't completely hold water.  It's a nice, well-done time loop, but if you consider what happens, then by that basis, I'd suspect a LOT of people could just as easily be accused of murder on such thing ground.  <br />Whether or not Minority Report would appeal to the traditional summer crowd is a little iffy.  There's not a whole lot of action (though the jetpack chase/car factory fight is the most hectic, exciting action scene I've seen all year), the story requires undivided attention (and maybe even a repeat viewing to gather in all the themes), and the downbeat tone, almost pessimistic tone will throw a lot of viewers off.  But for those who do get caught up in this twisty tale (and that should apply to most people), Minority Report offers a lot of rewards, more than you could reasonably expect from a big-budget blockbuster. <br />A lot of people see Minority Report as a warning for how far technology could go and bite us back.  While such a statement works to an extent for A.I., Report is mostly about morals, accepted ethics, and an intriguing look on just how far people are willing to go for theirown survival in this \\"winner takes all\\" society.  As far as science fiction goes, the genre hasn't been this damned smart and thought-provoking since Dark City.
0060977493|1.0|This book should have been called &quot;The God of Overwritten, Underanalyzed Things&quot;. The writing is so poor I actually put the book down and started to laugh several times (at passages that were NOT supposed to be funny). The Indian style of word play and the special mode of dialogue wielded so masterfully by truly talented writers like Rushdie, in Roy's unskilled hands simply comes off as cloying and immature. I felt, throughout, that I'd mistakenly picked up a Young Adult novel.
B00005RHGK|1.0|Perhaps the only movie I've seen that deserves negative stars.  Absolutely the most boring, banal, worthless, unscary drivel I've ever seen.  The plot is absurd, the villain is ridiculous, and the acting is the most horrific aspect of the entire movie.  The basic plot is that a brother and sister are driving in some backwater (of course) when they hit something (paging I Know What You Did Last Whatever...) and they stumble across some really ugly monster who feeds off people.  Can they save themselves in time?  Brr.  Scary. <yawn><br />Do yourself a favor and stay away.  Far, far away.
B00005JKNF|5.0|I loved this film.  One of my favorite of last year.  I like the DVD because I can watch it with captions.  You don't realize how much you miss because during the course of the film the actors talk over each other.  There is foreground dialogue and background dialogue and the captioning picks up both.  So you get a lot of little details that you miss if you're just watching it without the captions.<br />Also Julian Fellow's commentary is wonderful.  I loved listening to him explain the cultural details in the scenes as well as his little bon mots about where some of the ideas for dialogue came from.  <br />I highly recommend.
B00006IU73|5.0|From the massive metallic opening riff of \\"Blackest Eyes\\" to the melancholic multi-layered finale of \\"Collapse the Light Into Earth\\" this albums is flawless.  In Absentia, in my opinion, is the definitive Porcupine Tree album, it combines the darkness and heaviness of Signify with the pop sensibilites of Stupid Dream.  Take for instance track two \\"Trains\\" which makes me weep as does \\"Heartattack in a Layby\\" two wonderful acoustic driven songs that cry out for repeated listens and will stick inside your head for ages.  Then tracks like \\"Strip the Soul\\" and \\"Wedding Nails\\" which are heavier songs that show off their musicianship without delving into pretentiousness, the former which is disturbing lyrically and a little reminiscent of Tool musically and the latter an instrumental which is somewhat jazz meets metal, bad descriptions perhaps, but not many bands other than Porcupine Tree can jump from utterly beautiful to complex and heavy without sounding ridiculous.  Why this band is not out there with their mugs on the front of Rolling Stone or NME and collecting rave reviews from all and sundry is a crying shame, then again any band tagged with the labed of \\"prog\\" is bound to be ignored by popular music mags.  What an unfair world this is.  Do yourselves a favour and buy this, it is by far the best album of the year.
B00005B6N7|5.0|U-571 follows a fictional crew of submariners who attempt to steal a German Enigma encoding machine from one of their U-Boats. The movie is led by an all-star cast including Bill Paxton as Lt. Commander Mike Dahlgren, Matthew McConaughey, who does an excellent job as X.O. Andy Tyler, Harvey Keitel as the rough and tough Chief Klough, and Jon Bon Jovi as Tyler's Annapolis buddy Lt. Pete Emmitt.  The group is on a 48 hour pass when they are interrupted and told of a crippled German U-Boat that is adrift in the North Atlantic.  A plan is devised to send in an American submarine disguised as a German U-Boat, board the enemy submarine, and steal the Enigma machine, which was used for encoding secret messages. The plan works well at the beginning, as the group is able to board the enemy submarine, but disaster soon follows as a real German submarine sent to repair the crippled one appears on the scene and fires a torpedo at the disguised American boat.  Tyler, Chief Klough, Emmitt, and the other survivors are forced to board the crippled sub to escape.  What happens next is a thrilling battle of wits between the Germans and Americans as the group attempts to escape with the Enigma while the Germans try to sink them.<br />The battle scenes, especially the depth charge attacks, are first-rate and very realistic.  You can almost feel yourself shaking along with the crew as the depth charges move ever closer to the sub.  Matthew McConaughey is outstanding in his role as Tyler as he tries to outwit the enemy and bring his crew to safety.<br />I am a big fan of submarine movies, including Crimson Tide and The Hunt for Red October, and U-571 deserves a place alongside these other fine films. I also thought the producers of the film did a nice job of including the names of actual World War II German submarines that were actually boarded and had their Enigma machines taken by the Allies at the end of the movie.  If you enjoy submarine movies, then you will surely enjoy U-571. It is loaded with high-paced action and suspense that will be sure to hold your attention throughout.
B00001PE4D|5.0|Yeah, it's a take off of Dangerous Liasions, but with snappy dialogue, a young, but extremely talented cast, and a plausibility that's frightening.  Headed by Gellar, Witherspoon and Phillipe, this is an extremely well-plotted psychological movie that demonstrates people at their most base and manipulative, but it's also frothy and fun.<br />The biggest surprise for viewers here may be Gellar's viper-like performance (no surprise to those who watched her in her AMC days).  This is not Bufffy, and it shows what a phenomenal talent Gellar is.  Witherspoon is cast as the virgin/ingenue, but her superior ability keeps you from resenting her or rolling your eyes.  Phillipe is perfectly-cast as the charmingly devilish rogue.  Great supporting work from Selma Blair and Christine Baranski complete the cast.<br />Bottom line, this is a fun and stylish psychological thriller with an ending that doesn't wrap everything up into a pretty bow, but does offer more than satisfying resolutions.<br />Recommended for Gellar's performance, a witty script and yet another reason to regard Witherspoon as the greatest actress of her generation.
B00005JKJA|4.0|Following the dismally unwatchable trainwreck \\"Lost Highway\\", and the atypically mainstream \\"Straight Story\\", David Lynch redeems himself and proves he still has \\"it\\" with the brilliant \\"Muholland Drive\\". Compelling atmosphere and haunting images are blended with a surprising amount of black comedy and steamy eroticism to arguably make this one of Lynch's more consistently \\"watchable\\" films. All of the Lynchian trademarks are here--a creepy murder mystery, Dreams vs Reality, Roy Orbison songs, Fellini-esque extras (interestingly, no dwarves in this outing), overly made-up torch singers standing in front of red curtains...in fact at times one almost gets the feeling that Lynch is winking at the audience and doing a parody of a \\"typical David Lynch film\\"! A subtly layered star performance from Naomi Watts keeps things moving, and Laura Elena Harring (the new Laura Flynn Boyle? Discuss) nails it as the dead sexy, darkly alluring femme fatale. The much-debated storyline is really a no-brainer-in fact it is yet one more variation on the \\"twist\\" from writer Ambrose Bierce's classic \\"Occurance At Owl Creek Bridge\\" (sorry -that's a bit of a 'spoiler', but then again no two people interpret a David Lynch film the same way). Lynch fans will wet themselves.
0792844882|4.0|But it's still one of the only movies I'm able to watch again and again. It's worth it alone for the shows, the dancing, creative nudity, and most of all the silly characters. Every single one of them acted in ways that are completely unbelievable. This is a cult film, to be enjoyed for lovers of movies like Heathers, Rocky Horror Picture Show and Lawnmower Man. This movie is not to be taken seriously.
B000021Y7X|5.0|I'm not a big fan of the Talking Heads.  More just a casual admirer.  But even so, I love this dvd.  The concert is amazing, not only with musicianship, but the whole concept of building the staging up from nothing is pulled off fantastically.  The included commentaries make this a must buy for anyone interested in music -- especially the art of live performance.
B00005J6T0|5.0|True Blue made the first real departure Madonna made in her earlier career.  Here is when she dropped the bubblegum voice, and showed off her rich, deeper alto tones.  Here, she begins writing her own heartfelt and topical tunes and her trademarked production standards.  Here is where all the reinventions really began.<br />Full of great poptunes which are now regarded as standards [such] as \\"Papa Don't Preach,\\" \\"Live to Tell,\\" and \\"Open Your Heart,\\" True Blue marks the emergence of Madonna as a true force in the pop industry and offers a glimpse of what's to come.<br />As timeless as the diva herself, this record holds up to review almost 20 years later, and perhaps that's her greatest achievement.
0783225903|5.0|If you miss the first five minutes of this movie, you will not<br />get it. Everything began to fall apart with one person's<br />inability to live with their fellow being. It really is that<br />simple of a story. That is the genius of Terry Gilliam....This movie encompasses this and everything else you can think<br />of into the wildest, darkest, happiest, stupidest ride you ever<br />had in your life! Probably one of the best ten movies of all<br />time. Sincerely.

B00005Q45W|3.0|The strengths and weaknesses of this album share many characteristics with Cohen's Death of a Lady's Man album.  In both cases, Cohen's artistry is filtered through a collaboration with another.  I must say that the collaboration with Sharon Robinson is more listenable than his earlier collaboration with Phil Specter.  But in the end it's kind of like adding milk to hot tea: mellower in flavor but I, for one, miss the bite of the undiluted original.
6302759110|4.0|Loaded with vivid imagery, stunning cinematography, and eyepopping special effects, Francis Ford Coppola's DRACULA is visually impressive and frightfully entertaining.  A haunting, well-paced story, augmented by superb performances by Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins, recreates the shadowy, murky world of Bram Stoker's novel.<br />Despite all the positives of this film, and they are numerous, some rather quirky writing prevents this reviewer from awarding five stars.  When Winona Ryder's character (Mina) tearfully implores Dracula, \\"Take me away from all this...death!\\", I have to stop the videotape while I laugh until my sides hurt.  No better way to avoid death than hang out with a vampire, eh, Mina?  That line is a howler.  Worse yet is the climactic scene, when a dying Dracula looks heavenward and proclaims, \\"It is finished.\\"  Such a grisly comparison to the words of the New Testament is glaringly inappropriate and callous.<br />And yet, these writing brain cramps do not diminish the entertainment component of this well-made film.
B0000024U8|5.0|The openning riff from the first track, Bloomfield's sweet and sleepy How Do You Do, is the bait.  You hear it, you turn your head and smile.  But if you're busy, if you got things on your mind, you better keep walking, cause if you pause, even for a second, you're hooked.  There's no escape.<br />It has been over 30 years, and those notes still come at me from out of nowhere.  Anytime, anywhere, and when they begin I am taken away.  Caught in the web.<br />The Bloomfield side is some of the most soulful blues stuff you will ever hear.  It is tight, yet easy.  Exact, but wandering.  It reminds those of us who were there that Eric Clapton was not the only white blues guitar player to matter.  But Bloomfield couldnt make the switch to the pop side.  Poof. Gone.<br />The Steve Stills side of this record might seem like a letdown at first, because it is so different, and he is so inferior to Bloomfield as a player.  But had they been reversed, and the Stills side played first, it would have been very likely the other way around.  Because it wouldnt have been a Blues record first, and a rock record second.  Stills shows a side that doesnt come off anywhere else in any of his recordings.  Must be the season of the witch.<br />Give this as a gift to anyone with a well rounded musical soul, and it will be very much appreciated. <br />Interesting note.  The horns were added to the recording as an afterthought.  Very nice thinking, Al Kooper.
B00004S35Z|4.0|This is definately not my favorite Stevie Wonder album, but it does contain my 2 favorite songs by him, &quot;Boogie on Reggae Woman&quot; and &quot;Heaven is 10 zillion..&quot; <br />The way I see it Stevie had 3 main songwriting formats: 1. Uptempo Funk 2. Soul 3. Love Ballads.  Where I never much cared for his ballads, I think that &quot;Heaven is 10 Zillion..&quot; represents the pinnacle of of his soul/gospel side, that song is so perfectly underproduced and intelligently played and sung, I still get entranced everytime I hear it.  Along with that &quot;Boogie on Reggae woman&quot; along with &quot;Superstition&quot; represent the absolute perfection of Stevie's funk formula.  Know one played funk music like him, he didnt rely on a million musicians (Parliament, etc.), he could do it with a couple keyboards, and some drums (maybe some tasteful horns thrown in for good measure) and he could do it so much better than his more bombastic counterparts. <br /> Now the reason I say this record is not his best is because I think his others have *more* good songs.  I do also love &quot;You Haven't Done Nothin&quot;, though it is VERY reminiscent of &quot;Superstition&quot; in song structure, but you cant blame a guy for stealing his own good idea.  &quot;Creepin&quot; is a favorite as well.  With Stevie you pretty much have to buy all his albums from &quot;Music of My Mind&quot; to &quot;Hotter Than July&quot; to truly understand his genius, so again this is just another step, but dont make the mistake of overlooking it.
B00005M91K|3.0|Baraka - meaning \\"blessing\\" in Arabic - is a film which presents images of our world and of various human societies.  There is no \\"script\\" as such and as the film progresses various human actions and landscapes are juxtaposed to make points about man and his environment.  Music is used to create more depth in this process and to govern the pace and feel of the cinematography.  It's all very well done and the visual impact is great. All in all a very watchable and involving film.<br />My one major gripe is that this has really been done before and rather better, too.  \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\", a colloboration between composer Philip Glass and cinematographer Godfrey Reggio covered this same ground with more panache and a stunning soundtrack courtesy of Mr Glass.<br />My immediate impression of this film then is that it is straight plagiarism ie an uncredited copy of someone elses artistic creation.  Having seen both films it is very hard for me to escape from this impression.  Worse, Baraka does not really improve on the original in any way. <br />My suggestion would be to buy the original Koyaanisqatsi and to watch that.  In reality it is an extremely influential film and the techniques and approaches which it pioneered have been copied and emulated in hundreds of other productions from films to adverts to MTV-type videos.  The added bonus here is the soundtrack which in isolation is a good example of modern classical music which has acheived enormous public popularity.  Together the cinematography and the music work well together and the result is an immensely watchable example of original and significant filmic creativity.<br />This review in no way criticises the actual film \\"Baraka\\", which in itself is an involving film, but is suggesting that the original which sparked the ideas remains the better film and should be watched in preference.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Because Norah Jones's voice is disarmingly calm and cool, it is difficult to NOT enjoy this music. Her voice is very pretty, and her piano playing is at least adequate (sorry, but it's not that difficult). Nonetheless, the kicker is &quot;Cold Cold Heart,&quot; which I'm sure Hank Williams never expected would be treated like this. &quot;Come Away with Me&quot; and &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; best exemplify her ability to not put too much power into a song and yet still have the emotional aspects come through loud and clear. Definitely recommended for those who want a bridge between pop and jazz.
014028009X|3.0|It is basically as described in its title; the diary of Bridget Jonnes, whom I thought would be much funnier. I think those who said it was hilarious gave it much more credit than it deserves. Bridget Jones is a woman in her 30s who THINKS she's funny and shows us, through what she writes in her diary, how her life developes within a year.<br />I kept reading the book, hoping it would get more intresting, but it didn't. I actually like reading stories written as diaries, but this one did not meet my expectations. Try reading &quot;Diary of a mad Bride&quot;, you'll see what I mean. :)
B00006F7S4|5.0|I have always liked Beck's singles, but I've never bought any of his albums.  After hearing Sea Change, I'll be purchasing all of them.

I didn't have much luck. My girlfriend then gave me a copy of Watership Down for Christmas.  It had been one of her favorite books, but I had never read it. As soon as I started, I didn't want to put it down. The characters and story are terrific.  It instantly became one of my favorite books.  I've read a number of books since that I've also enjoyed, but none more so than Watership Down.  I realize it is often considered a book for children or teenagers, but I don't think there are many people of any age that wouldn't enjoy this book.  I would recommend it to anyone.

0064409422|4.0|A Fabulous book that catches that boringness that could be invading your life right now and tosses it out.  Four siblings- Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy-discover a land unbelievable to the people who have only heard.  This land is full of rich enchantment of a dream, but it is under the controll of the horrible White Witch who claims to be the queen of the wonderous land of Narnia.  These four kids are claimed to be the end of all the evil in the land so the Witch wants to destroy, but the great, untamed lion-Aslan-has returned to put all things to right, yet will he come, or is it just a rumor.  Answers are packed in the book so go and get it because this book is so the best.  Don't forget the rest of the series though, it's all the greatest.
B00004WG2X|4.0|I own this movie, and while i still enjoy watching it occasionally, it's not my favorite anymore as the BBC miniseries with Colin Firth is much better. It's a good movie to own if you can't own the miniseries, and if you've enjoyed watching this, i definitely recommend the miniseries. I also recommend you read the book, nothing depicts Jane Austen's classic like her own writing.
076790382X|3.0|I bought this book expecting more analysis from Bill Bryson on elements that make up America.  This book does have some of this in Bryson's laid back and humourous manner.  However, some of it is a bit more of a focus on his personal qualms with America other than an objective assessment.  Not having read Bryson before I was expecting something a little more even.<br />He does complain.  A lot.  But thankfully for his humour (in which he admits he complains a lot!) the book carries well and has some good anecdotes which open up America and other more personal anecdotes which tell you more about Bryson and his family than of the USA.<br />I should mention that this is not a one piece book - but a collection of articles that he wrote over a two year period for a column in a newspaper.  Because of this, you may tire from reading the same 'formula' for each chapter/article.<br />None the less I was happy with the purchase and it was an easy read and gentle start to my amateur analysis on what makes the USA what it is.
0871294273|1.0|The Hobbit is so boring I would not recomend reading it.  It has no action that actually lights up your mind and makes you want to continue and finish the book.  The story is about a pleasent, independent, little hobbit, Bilbo, that has been chosen to be a burgler without further notice to go on a quest with 13 dwarves into exhausting danger that may just be the end for dear old Mr. Bilbo.  If you'd like to discover what will happen to Bilbo and his faithful leaders then feel free to pick this book up, but i wouldn't recomend it.
6304057709|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! I've read the book and at first was hesitant to watch the movie as i didn't think that a movie could do justice to it... but I was wrong. The characters are portrayed perfectly, and the movie is fun to watch even for those who are not familiar with Jane Austen's works. Definitely highly recommended, particularly for a girls movie night...
B00006JLX4|5.0|Pavement has decided to release a classic record a la Velvet Underground- 2 disc set with more bonuses than most DVDs. Good for them. Everything on it is incredible. Good for us.<br />At first glance, one would think this is just S+E with a bunch of low quality demos. This is most certainly not the case. The recording sessions, the John Peel sessions, and the live show are all just as good as S+E and Watery, Domestic themselves.<br />This collection is sheer perfection, combining one of the best albums and EPs of the 1990s with rarities to whet the appetite of any completist. As stated before, the production quality for the extras is outstanding and there is not one lousy track to be found here. In fact, the only compaint I have is that there are three versions of \\"Here\\" on disc one, so I got a bit tired fo the song after awhile. (Second place goes to Summer Babe, which appears twice on disc one and once on disc two.)<br />S+E is also packaged with a 50+ booklet containing various anecdotes from people like the band members and record label heads. All of htese thrown amongst a mess of notes, lyrics, and photos.<br />If it had not included Slanted and Enchanted nor Watery, Domestic, this set would still be worth its price; it's that good. What does that mean? If you own the original, GET THIS ANYWAY. You'll thank me later. As for your old copy, give that one to someone you respect and spread the joy.
6304082428|5.0|I am an avid Jane Austen fan, and Pride and Prejudice was the book that got me hooked! This miniseries is absolutely marvelous. While I had been previously hooked to other productions of Pride &amp; Prejudice, watching the miniseries once made me a fan. I now own it and watch it constantly. The characters are very true to life, and represent Jane Austen's description ver closely. It's fun to watch, extremely interesting, and highly recommended even to none Jane Austen fans.  This book truly brings to life Jane's classic in a way that no other movie/tv adaptation has been able to before.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I don't feel the need to elaborate!  This is a great CD and I highly recommend it.
6303965415|2.0|While I absolutely love the book (I am a huge Jane Austen fan), and I love watching other movies based on her books, this book was just not up to standards. The acting is rather weak, as is the production, and it tends to be rather boring... I've watched it a total of 3 times, twice i didn't watch it all the way through. The characters are not well portrayed at all, and through the movie they seem way too weak and whimpy... I was rather disappointed with this as I don't believe there are any good productions of Persuasion.
B00003CXXP|5.0|About 10 family members of mine saw this show at the theater and the overwhelming verdict was not to waste my time with it.  Five of them thought it was the worst movie they had ever seen.  I had to see for myself, thank goodness.  I thought this film was beatifully made, brilliantly acted, and (this is where others vehemenently disagree) had a wonderfull storyline.
B0000027RL|5.0|If you don't have that CD, that means that you don't know Pearl Jam or You hate rock or You were on Mars the last 12 years !<br />  Nothing more to say: \\"TEN\\" is a MASTERPIECE ! A must have for whoever like \\"good\\" ROCK  (Led-Zep, Hendrix, Tesla etc...) If you don't have it, get it in medical emergency! If you own it already, get another one... just in case!
0380820846|3.0|Julia Quinn, whose books I usually adore, has written a whole lot of nothin' in Romancing Mr. Bridgerton. I've followed all the Bridgertons from Daphne to Benedict and enjoyed their charming, hilarious romances. Here we have the perfect foils: adorable, smart Penelope Featherington and handsome, charming Colin Bridgerton. As characters, they are as endearing as Daphne and Simon &amp; Kate and Anthony. But NOTHING HAPPENS!! Page after page of inane dialogue that goes nowhere. No plot, no action, no purpose. Even &quot;comedy&quot; scenes, where the characters end up falling all over the floor in hysterical laughter failed to elicit a smile from my lips. Come on, Julia - you can do MUCH better than this!!
B000002J6H|4.0|Stills inferior to Crosby and Nash? Who plays every lead instrument on their first album together? Stills. He also wrote their most sophisticated hits, &quot;Suite: Judy Blue Eyes&quot; and &quot;Carry On.&quot; Further, Stills' compositional, instrumental, and vocal skills evolved considerably after he wrote and recorded &quot;For What It's Worth.&quot; The style of that old chestnut bears no resemblance to anything on this album; McNett mentioning the song is little more than name-dropping.
B00003CX5P|3.0|Most dedicated Star Wars fans probably saw \\"The Phantom Menace\\" at the theaters.  The first installment of the new Star Wars trilogy was unfortunately considered a disappointment by fans and critics alike.  In fact, you can count me among the originally disappointed.<br />Still, I ended up buying the DVD (as any Star Wars fan might) and I now find that on repeated viewings \\"The Phantom Menace\\" gets better and better.<br />So for those \\"disappointed fans\\" out there, I say give this movie a second chance.  By the way, the DVD extras are fun, too -- especially composer John Williams' \\"music video.\\"

B00005U122|5.0|I own approx 50 music DVD's and this is just the finest of them all.<BR>The picture quality is not the the best but still very good. <BR>When it comes to the sound, and most important of all, the content, then this is where it scores so very highly. If I could award this 10 stars then I would.<BR>Roger Waters is quite superb with his brand of music and lyrics. I am not sure whether it is my age that draws me to this genre, but having said that, my son likes this very much aswell. <BR>There is no substitute for sheer and utter class...
0743424425|5.0|The Shining kept me up for hours at night as I heard noises all over the house.This is Stephen Kings finest novel ever. I give the movie and the miniseries 5 stars.<BR>   The Overlook Hotel has an evil history which can be brought to life by people who have The Shining, or Jack Torrances son Danny. Jack and his family must take care of the Overlook for the whole winter. Could there be a clasic case of cabin fever? You will have to find this out for yourself. It's nearley impossible to predict the \\"forgotten\\" ending of this Stephen King masterpiece.
B000066NW0|4.0|Picked up this CD at the library for my 9 year old daughter as she had to have Complicated.  I have actually been listening to the CD lately.  I actually don't care for the two singles that have been released (perhaps because I hear them about 90 times a day if I'm listening to radio).  The little gems for me on this album are LOSING GRIP with its slightly harder edge, and I&quot;M WITH YOU.  Hey she might not be the most talented singer in the world (heck I like Mick Jagger and Roger Daltrey and neither can sing) but the album is very listenable.  I'm an old fart and I like it!
0812550706|5.0|OSC is one of the best writers in the US today.  In fact I will go so far as to say he is second only to Stephen King.  <br />This book and Ender's Shadow are both great stand-alone peices that he has written.  I read Ender's game around 1996.  I heard about Ender's Shadow a month or two ago and have recently finished the series.  I have read all of the Ender and Shadow series and will continue to do so as long as they keep being written.<br />If you are not familiar with OSC, he is also the author/playright of the Abyss!  Ender's Game is planned to be made into a movie by WB and the producer of a Perfect Storm.  Read the book now, before you see the movie!  <br />The book is about a young strategic genius that has to save the human race, and the world, from a race of hive-like aliens called the formics or Buggers.  It is a very fast paced book, and it's unlikely you'll be able to put it down once you have gotten through the first few chapters.  I would say more about the book, but I hate people giving away any information about books and movies so I won't.
B000065V9P|5.0|I love that Peter Gabriel continues to include us in his personal evolution and growth...and he is always evolving. If you like this, you'll love his later releases including his new CD Growing Up!
0812550757|4.0|OSC is one of the best writers in the US today.  In fact I will go so far as to say he is second only to Stephen King.  <br />This book is not a stand-alone book, it is a sequal to Ender's Game.  I read this book around 1996.  I heard about Ender's Shadow a month or two ago and have recently finished the series.  I have read all of the Ender and Shadow series and will continue to do so as long as they keep being written.<br />If you are not familiar with OSC, he is also the author/playright of the Abyss!  Ender's Game is planned to be made into a movie by WB and the producer of a Perfect Storm.  <br />This book is about Ender's life off-planet after having saved the world.  This book is very philosophical and has less action.  It is a not as fast paced as Ender's Game.  I would say more about the book, but I hate people giving away any information about books and movies so I won't.
B00006F7S4|5.0|With each new release, I dig this guy even more. This CD mixes a peaceful, yet moody ambience that &quot;Takes you away from it all.&quot; Calgon has nothing over Beck. I'm looking forward to seeing him in concert.
0679411585|5.0|I first saw the movie, was moved, then read the book. This book is FANTASTIC -- best book on small-unit combat tactics I have ever read.<br />It deals with two battles: one at Landing Zone (LZ) X-Ray and another a day later at LZ Albany, a few miles from LZ X-Ray. The battle at LZ X-Ray lasted several days under the direction of Lt. Col. Hal Moore. Moore, the American battalion commander, and Joe Galloway (a UPI photographer present throughout the battle) wrote the book. This battle was a testament to the military leadership and skill of Moore and his company commanders, as well as the spirit of his men, along with the chopper pilots and artillery units that supported them. <br />The second part of the book deals with the battle at LZ Albany a few days later and illustrates what harm a poor commander can do to his men. The Americans were slaughtered.<br />This is a book on tactics and on leadership. But it reads like a novel and will have you riveted to your seat!!! (Moore has quotes from many of his men and the tales they recount make you want to cheer and then cry.) After reading this book (in one night -- I couldn't put it down! -- I recalled the line by Frederick March after William Holden's death in the movie, \\"Bridges at Toko-Ri\\". March asked himself, \\"Where do we get such men? Where do we get such men?\\"<br />This is a GREAT book. Get it!!
B0000640SA|5.0|Dude, this movie ROCKED!  Backwards, forwards, side-to-side!  Can you remember who did it?  What was done?  Who are you?  Who am I?  What's going on, anyway?  My head hurts, this film twisted it right off!
B000001ES9|3.0|As a band, Rush has been constantly reinventing itself, experimenting with new styles, progressing and growing as musicians. This album is where it began. And comparing it with their latest, you can see how after nearly 30 years together, they've gone so far from where they started, they may as well be a different band. And personnel-wise, they are indeed different, as this album doesn't have Neil Peart's drumming or lyrical talents. Percussion is handled ably by John Rutsey, who left the band shortly after this album.<BR><BR>This one gets a bad rap from a lot of people, but it's not so bad. I enjoy listening to it every once in a while. In a few songs, you can really hear the oft-repeated \\"Led Zeppelin influence.\\" It's there, but while their roots are clear, they also manage to produce their own musical style that departs from the influences. This is purely a hard rock album, not venturing into the progressive styles that became their trademark later on.<BR><BR>Of course, this is the album with the concert standard \\"Working Man\\" on it. That's always fun to listen to. And despite some truly awful lyrics in some songs, the music is great throughout the album.<BR><BR>Not their best, barely like the other albums at all, but still one I play occasionally.
0684853523|4.0|One of the things I've always loved about Stephen King's works is his no-nonsense, no-BS, straight-forward way of speaking to his readers. _On Writing_ contains that same intimate, friendly tone and offers solid advice for those of us who are struggling in the initial throes of Being A Writer.<br />King gives very few hard-and-fast rules in this book; mostly, he talks about the *process* he goes through when writing, and how it might work for others. He also gives some of his own back story in short memory-flashes which go back to his childhood, early adulthood, and recent events, which gives us insight into King both as a writer, and as a person. Throughout the book, too, is his overwhelming and obvious love for his wife, Tabitha, and what a crucial role she plays in everything he is and does.<br />He talks about the tools writers must (or should) use, and how to employ them, sometimes with ruthlessness, sometimes with great care, and he goes over the mechanics of writing and how to make it better. He briefly covers agents and publishers. His main point, though, is about _language_ - how to use it to best communicate a point, set a scene, describe a person, and how to accomplish these things without *over*doing them.<br />There is some really great advice in here, and at times King comes across as a patient, fatherly figure, who gives us permission to explore everything we can think of, and to not worry too much about how good it is during the first draft. He talks about instinctive use of words, and putting ourselves right out there in the open, where everyone can see us - but first, doing it in a safe place, where we can get everything out and onto the page without fear.<br />_On Writing_ is a book non-writer King fans can enjoy, too, as it gives glimpses (and sometimes long, hard stares) into King's life and times. He discusses difficult subjects, such as his alcohol and drug abuse problems, his recent near-death experience with a blue van, and how writing (in large part) helped him to pull through these events.<br />This is a very good book, and is a quick read - I read it in sips and gulps over the course of about two days. Four stars instead of five because it is, perhaps, too brief - reading this would make King's hair stand up on end and he would utter a blood-curdling shriek, because he was aiming for brevity in this book. He achieved it, but it makes me wonder how much better it could have been if he'd given himself free rein. His head has got to be jam-packed with ideas that would have worked into this book beautifully, and I think perhaps we, the readers, are poorer for those ideas not having been there.<br />Still, I'll keep this by my desk, and I know I'll refer to it from time to time, highlight certain inspiring and useful passages, and it will have its place firmly in my heart, because it let me get to know one of my favorite writers a bit better.
B00006JLX4|5.0|And so here it finally is...the glorious Slanted and Enchanted digitally remasted, considerably beefed up with bonus tracks, and packaged with a 60+ page booklet.  The bulk of the bonus material will already be familiar to Pavement's legions:  the Summer Babe single tracks were on Westing, the Peel sessions on the Stuff Up the Cracks bootleg, the concert on the Strayslack bootleg, and various other tracks on cd singles and compilations.  (The only two really unreleased songs are the new mix of \\"Here\\" and \\"Nothing Ever Happens\\"). ...  The sound quality of all of these recordings is so much better than their previous incarnations that it is a joy to listen to.  The Slanted album tracks sound crisper and clearer, and to hear the peel sessions in full, clear stereo is amazing.  <br />We all know that Slanted and Enchanted is a great, great album; from beginning to end, an absolute classic.  When included with the rest of the material on the discs, it really paints a vivid portrait of Pavement circa 1991-1992.  The alternate mix of \\"Here\\" adds a dreamy, spacey guitar line throughout, while \\"Nothing Ever Happens\\" is a catchy, poppy Spiral-sung tune.  The live show is alse nice to hear, as it really showcases Pavement's ragged, off-kilter glory at the time.  For my money, though, the real treats of this album lie in the Peel Sessions.  They comprise eight songs, of which seven were not heard in any form on any Pavement album.  \\"Circa 1762\\" is an awesome, upbeat song that I can't even believe never showed up on an album.  Likewise the subdued \\"Secret Knowledge of the Backroads\\", a Silver Jews cover, with its Casio-sprinkled musings.  \\"Kentucky Cocktail\\" is also great.  The second Peel Session had two instrumentals (\\"Drunks w/ Guns\\" and \\"The List of Dorms\\") along with \\"Rain Ammunition\\" an upbeat, wandering tune that name checks Primal Scream, and \\"Ed Ames\\", which tells a convoluted story of a detective.  These sessions really show a loose, spontaneous side of Pavement and they alone are worth the price of admission...
B00006DEF9|5.0|First things first: the reason this disc isn't in widescreen format is because the movie wasn't shot in widescreen! Gene Kelly HATED Cinemascope and its ilk, and never shot in widescreen unless he was forced to. Simple reason: not enough theaters had the wide screens installed. If you look at the shots in this movie, it's obvious the framing is intact.<br />Now, for the important stuff: is this disc worth owning, even if you already have the original DVD release (and the laserdisc)? I would give it an unqualified YES. The picture quality is--well--stunning is the only word for it. Scene after scene, I was seeing stuff I had never noticed before, and I've seen this movie at least 30 times. The commentary track includes insights from pretty-much all of the surviving people who were involved in the production (including the writers), so there are some great insider's anecdotes. (Still, I wish they could have put in Ron Haver's commentary from the Criterion Collection laserdisc, but I'm sure there were rights issues there.) A big raspberry, though, to Debbie Reynold's commentary performance. Mostly, what she does is introduce the other commentors by name, but she seems to think every one must be announced with great dramatic flair. \\"And now....Cyd Cha-r-r-isse!\\" Ugh.<br />Other than that, though, it's a great treatment for a great movie.
B00005R2BG|2.0|I expected a haunting drama glowing with crimson lips and lit by dim light bulb filaments, set in Paris on a damp night circa 1890.  <BR>Instead, I was blasted by a melodramatic comedy that made no sense and was just all in all stupid.  Buskers on speed bounce around in a cartoonish manner making jokes.  A fat guy dressed like a ring leader rolls around singing Madonna's &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;.  In one dance scene a dwarf woman does the Charleston to an awful remix of &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;.  <BR>This movie lacked so much and yet there was enough good material in there to make a decent picture.  The backbone romance worked well and some of the dance numbers could be slowed and set to period music.  Maybe I'll buy it on DVD and edit together my own version.  To remake Moulin Rouge would be my big project if I ever become a millionaire or decide to go to film school.
B00005NSWI|5.0|Being a long time listener of Ray Brown (and admiring Christian McBride) I thought this CD would be interesting.<br />Interesting is an understatement.<br />This CD is pure, unadulterated FUN!  Oh sure, these 3 guys are virtuousos of the first degree, but how many times have you heard people this talented just enjoying themselves in, essentially, their work!<br />For those who only remember Ray Brown as the bass player for the Merv Griffin house band, brace yourself.  Arguably one of the 4 greatest bassists in the long history of Jazz, he is nothing short of  booming here.  McBride is wicked!  He clearly is enjoying himself in the presence of one of his heroes.  I had not heard John Clayton before but, after buying this CD, I had to get anything relating to Superbass to hear more.<br />To me this CD is like hugging someone you love.  It never loses its appeal.
B000066F6H|4.0|We all remember the days of The Sex Pistols and and The Clash rocking our worlds with their new european sound, and now covet the albums of such bands as The Hives to save ourselves from the torment of pop music. Such albums as this seem to have cemented their spot towards the top of our collection. The cd starts out with the contagious sounds of Declare Guerre Nucleiare, and never lets up. Although nothing can compare to the wonderous days of The Ramones and Elvis Costello, The Hives come pretty close. Bands such as this enlighten me with hope on the possibility of good music actually being available to the mainstream audience since the days of Nirvana. If you enjoy to be blown out of your mind with the rocking tunes of fast drums and guitars with amps set to blow your mind, I highly reccommend this album.
B000002H70|5.0|Of all The Cure albums I do own (which isn't many I must admit), &quot;Disintegration&quot; is my pesonal favorite album by this legendary English band. I love the swirling, lush guitar sounds and the melancholy lyrics. Never have I heard such sorrow and heartache come through on one cd as I have heard on &quot;Disintegration&quot;. The melodies are absolutely stunning and indescribable. Robert Smith's vocals are at his best on this album I think, particularly on &quot;Pictures of You&quot;, my all time favorite song by The Cure as well as being one of my all time favorite song in general. &quot;Pictures of You&quot; is one of those songs that just makes me wanna weep every time I listen to it. I don't like the edited version found on &quot;Galore&quot;, the edited version takes away the epic feel that the original version has. I can never get sick of listening to &quot;Pictures of You&quot;. It is just one of the most beautiful ballads ever. &quot;Plainsong&quot; is another favorite ballad of mine. I love how subdued Robert Smith's vocals are on the song. And the heartache comes through his vocals as well. I must confess that &quot;Lovesong&quot; isn't exactly my favorite song on the album but I won't say that it is awful either. I guess that is because it is too upbeat on an otherwise moody album, and having such an upbeat song on this album sticks out like a sore thumb for me. Another thing that adds that dark, moody atmosphere to &quot;Disintegration&quot; is the rhythm section of Simon Gallup (bass) and Boris Williams (drums). The deep rich sounds of their instruments adds a whole 'nother level of richness to the band's brand of goth-influenced synth-pop. Other than &quot;Lovesong&quot;, all the songs on &quot;Disintegration&quot; is flawless. I definitely recommend &quot;Disintegration&quot; in a heartbeat for anyone interested in checking out The Cure's music.
B00005A3KS|1.0|all the dvd is, is the vhs version with the top and bottom cut off on the screen. <br />i rented the vhs and dvd together one day and found once you get passed the widescreen intro that the vhs version actually shows more of the movie. the dvd is the full screen version with the top and bottom removed!<br />this is ridiculous. go rent it yourself and see.
0767903854|5.0|Bryson is an excellent writer, and has a great sense of humor.  I'm currently studying at Curtin Uni in Perth, WA and I keep rembering things from the book and how they apply to life in Australia.
0385474547|3.0|I'd actually give this 2.5 stars, but that's not an option.  I just don't see the appeal of this book.  I kept reading it hoping that the story would pick up but it never did.  I kept hoping that I would start to care about the main character (or any character for that matter), but that never happened either.  No character development and no driving plot.  This book failed to capture my interest.  Skip this book and check out Siddhartha
B000008HPE|2.0|Huey Lewis is a walking talking clich&eacute;. His music is basically classic rock light. When you first here it, it sounds familiar, the longer you listen, the less appealing it becomes. Everything he does has done before and better, and will be done better again. Best for all if he just sank back into the mire. Truth be told, I picked this album up completely by accident, I bought a copy of Dire Straits COMMUNIQUE at a second hand shop and this record was inside, thus I am denied the pleasure of selling it back for credit, of course, I did enjoy throwing it away.
0375414053|5.0|This book is clever, well written, and dead on funny.  The only problem I have is that poor Kate's life is so stressful, that I get stressed out just reading about it!  A must read, not only for working moms, but for every woman who is contemplating combining motherhood with a career.
B000002G87|2.0|Other than Layla, there isn't much of interest here, just more British white boy blues, I'd stick to the comps.
B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie was longer then any movie I've ever seen.  I aged five years during it.  Never in my life have I been more bored or filled with more hatred for a film.
B00004U2G4|4.0|Beck, along with Clapton and John Mayall defined British Blues rock in the sixties and seventies. Eventually what these guys did would become heavy metal, and Beck, especially when he was teamed up with famous rock screecher Rod Stewart, really does sound like metal. Truth will be popular with fans of Aerosmith, Van Halen and AC/DC, as well as those intrigued by super groups like ELP and Cream and probably fans of prog as well. Beck is not really my thing, by his persistent popularity suggests that he has an appeal beyond baby boomers and sixties fans.
B000002IPZ|5.0|Though true, this disc, like the ones before it by Testament, fits squarely into the thrash metal category, this does not mean in any way that it suffers from the sloppy playing and one dimensional songwriting that is too often the mark of the genre. Souls of Black is one perfectly executed masterpiece, played with a perfect blend of speed, precision, heavyness and the raw power of thrash and speed metal. The lead guitar work of Alex Skolnick really shines here, raising the songs to a different level. Chuck Billy's vocals are in top form and the rest of the band plays tight as a drum. The songs are excellent from beggining to end, highlights are the title track, Face in the Sky, Absence of Light, One Man's Fate. Rock on Testament!
B00000K31V|1.0|worst movie ever,thats all i have to say about this movie
0553812173|3.0|As with any recent epic fantasy series the inevitable comparisons with Jordan's Wheel of Time or George Martin's series will arise as these are without a doubt the most popular contemporary epics. Jordan is a master of character creation and you feel like you know them - this at the expense sometimes of plot development which has left many frustrated.  Martin's characters arent developed to the same detail but are much more interesting with there being a fine line between good/evil.  There are things to like and dislike about the good and bad guys and he is willing for anyone to die at any time - very refreshing.  Now this book was a mixed bag for me.  It kept me reading with its interesting world and pace but I was frustrated throughout the book.  You never feel at home here.  Never fully understand the different characters motivations or the background to the current conflict.  In fact - there is no background at all.  You constantly are trying to grasp the meaning of what is going on and while it seems that it is very important or very intriguing the impact is missing because there is never a full understanding for the reader.  Despite these issues I read it quickly due to its pace and original story but it has not left me clamoring for more.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Beck is beyond definition....beyond category. Sea Change is a wonderfully beautiful materpiece. I was teased by the very first listen...mesmerized by the 2nd....and finally left my body on the 3rd. I played it for mixed company today and it was well recieved. Paper Tiger...wow! The internet is amazing! namaste`!
B000006MS3|5.0|Every October of my life, my attention somehow comes back to this record.  Like many other reviewers here, I am an enormous Kate Bush fan; I first discovered her in high school, when my friends insisted that Kate was amazing and carried about her LPs under their arms to swap and listen to after school.  I had been familiar with Kate's earlier, darkly weirdling folk-piano masterpieces that came prior to 'The Dreaming,' but when this LP dropped -- WOW.<br />First off, it is truly an amazing thing to listen to an album that stands the test of time. 'The Dreaming' dared to break ground that almost no one has ever dared to break again.  It doesn't exactly sound like the early '80s; in fact, I always thought of this as a studio masterpiece a la another album from 1982, Peter Gabriel's 'Security': and that Kate and Peter have worked together doesn't make this necessarily an accident.<BR>As a tour de force of songwriting and bravura execution, 'The Dreaming' is uniquely Kate.  Bold confessions; unusual subject matter.  Who else in the pop pantheon is going to write a song about Houdini's wife trying to contact the magician beyond the grave?  Who else is going to write a song about war with the chorus darkly chanting 'Pull out the pin...', to be answered by the anguished cries of 'I LOVE LIFE'?  20 years (WHOA!!) after its release, I'm still listening, and still enraptured by the sounds that unfold from the speakers.<br />The teaming of the utterly bizarre title track with 'Night of the Swallow' still moves me to tears, and features some of my favorite moments on the record.  After moving through the otherworldly aboriginal Dreamtime, there is a flurry of wings, birds being released...And shortly thereafter, Irish pipes kick in, to reveal Kate at her piano in one of the quieter moments on the record.  'Night of the Swallow' is a tremendous, Irish-folk inflected track, and again you have to wonder: who would have dared to have the background singers respond by cooing, as if they were swallows?  Well, it works, and this is mesmerizing stuff.<br />Describing this record is indeed difficult.  It is an original masterpiece in every way, and a record you're going to want to hear while dusk is settling in, or you're driving along a dark road, lost.  Kate, from the bottom of me heart, thank you.  And to the record company: for crying out loud, remaster this incredible disc already!
1883217040|5.0|There is no question in my mind that this is the best jazz theory book there is.  Not only that, it is the best by far.  Also get &quot;Scales for Jazz Improvisation&quot; by Dan Haerle for quick reference and I guarantee you'll be set.
0767805712|4.0|I love the look and feel of this movie, it's so '50s and immaculate - the wardrobe, the buildings the whole feel is nostalgic with a twist.  The plot is totally modern though - what would happen if genetic engineering of humans became de rigueur for all those that could afford it.  The film plays out the absurdity and the horror that this way of life would lead to.  It is a pretty cold film, lots of polished metal and cool emotions.  Some of the characters actions and motives are a little bit questionable at times, but for me, this film scores high on originality and its ability to provoke the question &quot;What if....?&quot;
B00006FXB6|4.0|I'd never really listened to QOTSA until I heard this album. Its awesome! The album flows so well from one song to the next. Great guitar and drums throughout. Buy it!

B00006AW2G|5.0|For my money this is the best Rolling Stones album ever, even if it is really not a typical example of their work. I do not think you can find a better opening to a Stones album than \\"Gimme Shelter\\" with Mary Clayton providing awesome guest vocals to some apocalyptic lyrics.  The catchy guitar lead suggests bad things are coming this way, a sentiment amplified by the high pitched, wordless vocals and the complimentary piano before the rest of the band crashes in and Mick Jagger starts singing.  I also know you can not top \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" as the big finale, what with the London Bach Choir lending their voices (not to mention Al Kooper providing the most memorable French Horn work on a sixties rock 'n' roll album).  I understand the idea that this is the Stones' response to \\"Hey Jude,\\" but it certainly stands on its own as a classic pop tune, which makes it a most atypical Stones song on that grounds alone.  Then there is the philosophical sentiments of the chorus, which again has you double-checking to make sure this is the same Stones who did \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" and were the acknowledged bad boys of rock 'n' roll.<br /><br />\\"Midnight Rambler,\\" which originally began Side 2 in those days of vinyl, is another one of those most rare long Stones songs and featured Mick Jagger wailing on his harp. \\"Monkey Man\\" is my all time favorite non-Stones hit song with Jagger pointing out \\" I hope we're not too messianic or a trifle too satanic\\" (I used it for a class assignment once as the music background for a Pat Paulsen speech) and \\"Country Honk\\" is a countrified version of their hit \\"Honky Tonk Woman.\\"  You also have a couple of acoustic blues tracks with \\"You Got the Silver,\\" which offers up the first lead vocals by Keith Richards, and a cover of Robert Johnson's \\"Love in Vain.\\"  \\"Live With Me\\" is a solid Stone rocker and the title song is okay, but what is important is that title: it fostered an inherent comparison with \\"Let It Be,\\" but since that was the Beatles' weakest album, the Stones came out ahead on this one.  Those were fun days in rock and roll, boys and girls, let me tell you.<br /><br />Special mention to the efforts of Nicky Hopkins on this album, who plays piano on most of the key tracks as well as the late Brian Jones, who appears on two of the tracks, as does his replacement, Mick Taylor. On top of all that, I love the way the back of the album deconstructs the front. \\"Beggar's Banquet\\" might be the more traditional Rolling Stones album, but \\"Let It Bleed\\" still holds the top spot for me and the last time I put together my Top 10 albums of all time list for my Pop Culture class \\"Let It Bleed\\" was on it. Finally, as it says at the bottom of the liner notes: THIS RECORD SHOULD BE PLAYED LOUD. It should also be played often.Beatles' weakest album, the Stones came out ahead on this one.

0316666343|2.0|I picked up this book because of the enormous hype behind it and from the majority of the positive testimonials here. Unfortunately I couldn't see what the big deal was. I thought the writing was ameteurish, it was uneccessarily and excessively gruesome in parts, the plot didn't engage me whatesoever, and I felt it was emotionally manipulative. The up side is it's a quick read. If you want a good cry, then by all means, carry on, but if you're looking for more message and meat in your literary choices, stick with something like 'The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay', the pulitzer winner of 2001.
B00004Y87O|4.0|If you've never seen this movie before, let me remind you that it was made in 1982, so forgive the bad guys for wearing Village People clothing. It's another great vision from John Carpenter, with Kurt Russell taking the excellent lead role as &quot;Snake Pliskin&quot;.<br />When this movie hit the theatres, it was probably one of the best futuristic movies ever made. Set in 1997, it imagines the City of New York transformed into a maximum-security prison. Ordinary criminals shunned by a weary society are left to fend for themselves behind the massive walls of the city. The inmate characters portrayed in this movie are unique in style and behavior. A few are just down-right weird (The Duke's #2 man is my favorite). Snake Pliskin is given a chance for freedom in exchange for saving the president (a self-interested and thankless character play by Donald Pleasance), who's plane has been hijacked and crashed into the city. Pliskin must fight off numerous gangs and thugs to reach the president and free him from his captors. But time is his biggest enemy, as you will see.<br />If you can get past the Control Room set, with thousands of useless flashing lights, ugly limo's, giant face-shields, super-sized watches (heck, I had a digital watch back in '82, and it was nowhere near the size of Pliskins) and bad guys wearing Sally Jessy Rafael glasses, you'll still enjoy this movie. The excellent settings of the city and the musical score (Carpenter's specialty) intensify his vision of a bleak and hopeless future for a once-great city overrun by crime.<br />There's a hole in the storyline, though. When Pliskin first gets injected with those micro-size charges, the doctor reassures him that they can burn out those charges with x-rays 15 minutes before his time is up. But he only has seconds left when they finally get to him, according to his huge watch. So, should Snake have died? Hell, no! The name's Pliskin!<br />Isn't it weird that Carpenter's best movies were made when he didn't have a big budget to play with. THE FOG is a good example of that. With that said, do yourself a favor and don't watch (or buy) the sequel, Escape from L.A. It is one of the worst sequels I've ever seen. What was he thinking? It's full of ridiculous scenes (the surfing comes immediately to mind) and fails to follow up on the previous film's effect. A big disappointment. Mr. Carpenter, if your going to make a sequel to one of your other great early films, please try to keep the storyline and atmosphere in check with the prior film. We dont need the million dollar explosions or outrageous plots to enjoy the film. Stick to the basics that made you so successful early on.
B00006JLX4|5.0|The amazing reissue of one of the best albums ever recorded; all the goodies are fantastic, and the original album still remains as fresh and exciting as the first time I heard it.  If you've never heard Pavement before and especially if you have and liked them (it's very hard not to) pick this up IMMEDIATELY.
0452282152|5.0|My husband and I both loved this book!!
0694013889|3.0|I bought this book, knowing it was an award winning book, but was very disappointed. The vocabulary is clumsy, as is the language.  It also is a bit strange, and not terribly captivating for my 2 1/2 yr old daughter.  The pictures are lovely though....
B00004SYWZ|4.0|Although not perfect this collection is a<br />big comeback for a group that started out<br />making some really interesting music(middle 80's) and faded out<br />of the picture during the 90's. They are all gifted and I new with the first collection way back in the middle 80's these harmonies had allot going, didn't<br />like the way \\"Take on me\\" stuck out of that collection, the<br />whole cd was excellent and not a late teen early 20's act cooked up by some big business hot shot, these guys are for real.They've come back<br />for this 2000 collection and there most recent \\"LIFELINES\\"(2002)<br />Both of these are very good recordings full of potential radio cuts.  I'm more partial to this<br />one but \\"Lifelines\\" is growning on me, love<br />the Beatles type stuff on several cuts. Morten has the most<br />beautiful vocal chops in the business, the most pure voice, so much reminds me of the best of what the Moody Blues did,<br />even Duran Duran, Roy Orbison, Chris Issak would even take<br />notice.  A-ha continues<br />to grow and mature and this collection especially<br />shines. My favorites on this, Velvet, Minor earth major sky,<br />the sun never shone that day, I wish I cared, to name a few.<br />The best comeback of the year that no one in the music business<br />cared to let America in on?<br /> Pick up Lifelines the new collection as well, same approach, you<br />won't get these songs out of your head.
0671449028|4.0|Great bed time book. The rhymes are fun, and it is a fantastically silly story.  My husband and daughter and I have all had this book memorized since she was 6 months old ( she is two and 1/2 now).  We love to recite it to one another, and have had to have two copies of the book (ah that teething stage was hard, she chewed right through everything.)  We all love Sandra Boynton, she is a reliable read and a lot of fun.
0671027379|5.0|In Dan Brown's Deception Point an amazing discovery above the Arctic Circle awaits verification by Rachel Sexton.  Rachel is the best person to verify this discovery for the President:  not only is she on his staff (as a low-level analyst for the NRO) but she is also the daughter of his most dangerous political opponent in the upcoming election.  This gives her the perfect status as a skeptic to join the team of civilian scientists in the verification of this NASA find.<br />Within hours, however, the lives of the team are in jeopardy as they discover that not everything is as it initially appears.  Thought the factions of the NRO, NASA, Senator Sexton's office and the White House are far away in Washington, someone has set into motion a series of events which makes it unlikely Rachel will escape the Arctic Circle alive.  In the background of the story is Rachel's estranged relationship with her father and a budding attraction to Michael Tolland, a celebrity oceanographer on the order of Jaques Cousteau.<br />Deception Point is the kind of flawless page-turner that can keep you up far past your bedtime.  I lost an entire night of sleep just trying to keep up with the plot twists.  When a hapless geologist is pushed out of a helicopter by nameless thugs on page 2, you know you're in for something exciting.  This story of political intrigue and survivalism continually turns the reader's expectations upside-down.  It is escapist literature at its finest.
B000066NW0|5.0|Let me tell you just how much i love this album!!!<BR>ALOT!!!<BR>it's so amazing, her melodic tunes, her cool voice, her attitude (the lyrics on the other hand can be a bit not so good, but not something big...)<BR>Anyway, there's not one song i don't like! i can listen to it from start to end with no skipping once!!!<BR>Really! they're all SO good!!!<br />i really recommend it to anyone!!!!<br />songs i like: complicated, sk8er boi, i'm with you, mobile, tommorow, anything but ordinary, loosing grip... oh, hell- they're all good!!!<br />what are you waiting for?! go cope this tight album!!!
B00003CX9Q|5.0|There are a lot of reviews about this DVD and they are on the right track ( at least the positive reviews anyway) I dont have time to read the 180+ reviews so I may be repeating something that may have already been said but I just want to point out that I really liked the menu feature on disk 1 ( 2002 release version) that allows you ro listen to the music that was recorded live when the movie premiered in March for the Special Olympics benefit. Not only do you hear the music as it was performed in front of the audience, you also get to hear the cheers and clapping of the audience which I thought was neat and as John Williams says, he believes that nothing like that has ever been done before.  Even if hit has been done, it was excellent.  A great way to watch the masterpiece. My one and only complaint about the DVD was that the original 1982 trailer <BR>was not on the disk along with the teaser for the 2002 release. Guess I'll have to keep my Laserdisc version.
B000002JQ6|4.0|This CD is both a Greatest Hits and a Live compilation.  The song selection is excellent, the music is crisp and clear.  What I don't like about this album is the breaks between the songs!  When I listen to a live album I like to feel that I am part of the audience, these breaks effectively break any sense of continuity that you get in a live show.  I can take a few breaks between songs, but in between ALL of them?<br />Otherwise, treat this as an excellent Greatest Hits Live.  Being AC/DC you know what you are getting, in your face heart pounding rock 'n roll!  If you're an AC/DC fan, you must get the 2 CD version, it's a lot better.
0060955775|5.0|This book and the message it carries is simply amazing. Nowadays, it is really so easy to get caught up in the so-called rat race but not know what you really want from life. My advice is to take a break, read this book and then stop to think. I've always found it sad that less and less people are not taking time to stop and smell the roses and to appreciate the simple joys in life until it's too late. For me, I've realised that the most beautiful things in life are free. You are never too busy to look around you and smile at the wonders of the world. This book is all about that. A great book!
B000000OS2|5.0|The first time I listened to this album I was surprised at the audacity of a hard rock band releasing an acustic album.  At the time it almost sounded classical to me (consider that at the time, Poison and Warrant were the coolest).  It effectively expanded my musical horizons.  Tesla is one of the most underrated bands ever, both Tommy Skeoh and Frankie Hannon are amazing and talented guitar players, their rythm section and vocals are top notch.  The song selection is excellent, mixing both some of their best songs and classics from other bands like the G. Dead and the Beatles.  Do yourself a favor, get both the CD AND the video.  In the video you'll get an extra song plus an extended acustic guitar solo before Love Song (probably their biggest hit).  Plus you'll get to figure out what they're talking about in between songs.
B00006IU73|5.0|I very much doubt I will hear anything more impressive than Absentia this calendar year. After the introspective Lightbulb Sun, Steven Wilson has allowed his recent fling with Death Metal infect his music with surprising results. From the opening thunder of \\"Blackest Eyes\\" through the searing Rush-like tantrum of \\"Wedding Nails\\" and the riveting Reznor-riffs of \\"Creator Has a Mastertape,\\" we're on new ground here, and it ain't particularly safe. <br />Moving in a passive-aggressive tangent from raging metal, through piercing ballad and back again, In Absentia is a torrid and exhausting 68 minutes. Conjuring themes of serial killers and then drifting back to simple heartache motifs then back again, In Absentia is as lyrically disturbing as it is musically complex. The amazing thing about these tracks is the way they graft themselves into your memory. <br />The gorgeous, massive requiem \\"Collapse The Light Into Earth,\\" closes the disc with as much of a crash as it began, albeit in an entirely different way. For me, this is why I listen to music.
B000000ORE|5.0|My favorite studio album from Tesla.  In my opinion it is their strongest album musically.  Songs like Paradise and Love Song provide feeling among hard rocking tunes, many of which are the envy of less talented bands that made it big.<br />It's too bad that Tesla came out in the 80's, many people put them in the same category as Poison, Bon Jovi, Warrant, and Def Leppard.  Tesla's music is music with both a purpose and a message, it is music that makes you think.  The guitar players are nothing short of virtuosos yet they don't need to make a display of skill in every song, once you listen you'll know why.  This is a most excellent band trapped in the wrong time period.
B00004Z459|5.0|This album is an awesome, unique album in a number of ways. First, it's a ferocious album with heartfelt vocals and screaming for a better society and better people in the world we live in. The band members are so frustrated with the society in which we are in that it made them create this fine and unique album. Second, the music itself is an awesome and incredible mix of hip-hop, techno, and heavy-metal that is amazing just listening to it. I am in awe of how they pulled that off so incredibly well, combined with the strong, intense, and even furious vocals. Third, the songs flow so incredibly well together from one song to the next, it's like listening to one entire entity as well as song by song (or track by track). <br />Keep up the excellent work, Linkin Park.
B00005JKGI|5.0|As a canadian That has lived in London England for a few years. I can say that this movie is one of the best to come off that island. Hey even sing the great escape song at football matches.<br />Michael Caine at his best ( And if your not a Michael Caine fan you will be after watching this movie). Also, the great car chase with three mini's and a very large bus.<br />If you are a fan of English Culture or you just want to watch a great movie buy it!
B00006FXB6|4.0|One of the better albums I've bought recently. This is much better than Rated R (the previous album by these guys.) There are some short guitar solos here and there, the druming has much more interesting fills and rhythms (Dave Grohl being the only drummer here,)bass lets loose every now and then. R was a little bit to all over the place and in that aspect, there were the heavy stoner rock songs, alternative songs, and  indie/garage rock. But the sound is perfect here and the style is a bit more of a straight rock album on Songs. Think Kyuss with a quicker tempo, cleaner vocals and more melody, less crunch. If that is intriguing enough then get this album. The self-titled is slightly better though.
B00000612G|5.0|The most underrated artist ever!..If u only heard of Richie Sambora cause hes in Bon Jovi, have another look..this guy has the most amazing voice and its an amazing songwriter...explosive mix!!...if u buy this cd i guarantee u wont regret it!!
0446677450|4.0|Before reading Rich Dad Poor Dad, my perspective on becoming successful and essentially being rich was just the opposite of what Robert Kiyosaki teaches in his book.  The book gives simple and straightforward advice on how to rethink and view money and success.  Kiyosaki tries to keep his ideas and perceptions about money understandable.  I didn't think the book was boring at all; however, sometimes Kiyosaki became repetitive and digressed from the subject.  Overall, I think I have gained a better and bigger sense of how to view money in the future.  Like many of his other reviewers, I think this book is a must read, not necessarily for it's story, but for it's lessons on how to become a smarter thinker in money and business.  Kiyosaki truly makes his readers think and re-evaluate their preconceptions about how to attain money.  As Kiyosaki mentions, higher education doesn't always necessarily associate with more money.  It is a person's ambition, passion, motivation, creativity, and insights that help him/her obtain wealth.  Kiyosaki's example of his rich dad and poor dad proves this very point.
B00002MZ4V|5.0|You dont need to be a Star Wars fan or even heard a lot of John Williams before...chances are if u listened to the themes of some of the most famous songs ever ull appreciate this cd.

0440217563|3.0|After reading the first two in the series, I am about to sit down to this one.  The cliffhanger ending of &quot;Dragonfly In Amber&quot; makes me want to pick it up right away - however, after reading here about Jamie's life after Claire returns to her own time, I'm having second thoughts.  Can someone tell me - how traumatic is it?  I can't believe that he would be with someone else, even if she DID leave!  How is this dealt with?  If he falls in love with someone else, or goes to someone else without feeling remorse, I don't think I'll be able to take it.  Can the reader manage to forgive him?  Please spare me the emotional truma if at all possible!<br />Also, I have to agree with the reader who commented that Claire missed her chance to set the record straight with Jack Randall in &quot;Dragonfly&quot;.  I wanted to shake her!  Come on!  Jack may have had Jamie's body in one depraved episode, but that's nothing compared to his soul and the love he and Claire share.  Just no competition...
B00004U8H4|4.0|This movie is well handled, to say the least.  This movie could have gone in so many different directions from the book.  I think it maintains the spirit of the novel.  There is some consolidation of characters, and thus some of the details are changed, but overall it is a pretty faithful production.  There is a little more humor in the movie, but I wouldn't go so far as to call this a &quot;dark comedy&quot;.  It is not very gory, which is extremely good, since I think graphic gore would have distracted from the messages.
B0000027RL|4.0|By any standards, this is an impressive rock album, never mind (no pun intended) a debut release.  It sold tonnes back in the day only due to superb timing (and a choice slot on Lollapalooza), although almost every band from Seattle released an album in '91 that did reasonable business for them.<br />But aside from all that, it was also a solid album, almost typical of the 80s, in that it contained a number of great singles (\\"Alive\\", \\"Evenflow\\") which overwhelmed even the most trite filler (\\"Deep\\", \\"Jeremy\\") and contained a few tunes (\\"Black\\", \\"Garden\\") that would have endeared them to the so-called dinosaurs they were said to be replacing (Skid Row, Poison, etc--even though they shared most of the same influences, but not the same hairdressers).<br />Realistically, they were in the right place at the right time, and to maintain their level of popularity shows that either they're doing SOMEthing right, or something's not right with that section of the population.<br />Subsequent albums are hit or miss--I never got into them as much as most of the die-hards; their sound just being a tad too arena-friendly stadium rock without the right amount of balls.  But Bob Marley's 'Legend' still represents the album everybody gets to complete their collection.<br />'Ten' is Pearl Jam's.
B000002ADT|5.0|&quot;Kind of Blue&quot; has an appeal so broad and far-reaching, that even those who aren't terribly familiar with jazz have this CD in their collection.  With the exception of John Coltrane's &quot;Blue Train,&quot; this release captures the essence of cool unlike any other album I know.  Each of these tracks moves along with confidence and poise, oozing class and sophistication with hardly any effort.  The musicianship on this album is perfect; while &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; has the spotlight on Miles, it's really an all-star effort featuring the work of Coltrane, Paul Chambers, Bill Evans, Wynton Kelly, and &quot;Cannonball&quot; Adderley.  The suave opener, &quot;So What,&quot; glides along so flawlessly, with its light cymbal taps, ultracool bass, and Davis' unmistakable trumpeting.  It's one of the most familiar tracks in Miles' catalogue, and for a good reason.  &quot;Blue In Green&quot; is a soft number that soars on the strength of great piano and Davis' gentle touches on the trumpet, giving a relaxing and soothing vibe.  The 11-minute &quot;All Blues&quot; shows nice interplay between Coltrane and Davis, and it's a personal favorite of mine.  Those who already own &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; are advised to get this remastered version if they haven't already done so.  On this version, the sound has more clarity, and the recording is an overall big improvement over the original release.  &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; is an unsinkable masterpiece that's really a can't-fail purchase.  It gives me images of a Saturday night at a local jazz bar, a stay-in-bed Sunday morning, or a quiet evening with that special someone.  Records like this not only sound great, but they forever change the way you listen to music.
0316666343|2.0|The critical chorus about this novel is strikingly different depending upon whether you read American or British reviews.  American reviewers, including other novelists such as Jonathan Franzen and Anna Quindlen, laud the book for its unsentimental, unsparing view of a tragedy, told from a unique perspective.  The British reviewers indulge themselves in unnecessary hostility and sarcasm as they criticize the book for its logical inconsistencies and cloying sugary sentimentality.  I don't feel hostile toward the novel, but I'm clearly living on the wrong side of the Atlantic.  At my students' suggestion, we read this novel in my college literature course where the reactions were decidedly mixed.  The premise of the book sounds like a gimmick, and, unfortunately, the execution does not lift the novel above that level.  &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; is a fast read, in part because it offers no challenges to our emotions or intellect.  Complex questions that might have been raised about the afterlife, about the process of grieving, about the ripple effects of horrifying violence, about the abnormal psychology of a serial killer simply are not engaged but  skirted.  Somehow, Sebold has written a &quot;feel good&quot; novel about an awful crime.  The book only succeeds in its rich portrayal of the dead girl's mother, a woman dealing with a compelling inner conflict that is exacerbated by her family's tragedy, a conflict that on its own is the stuff of a fascinating novel.  The rest of the characters, however, remain flat on the page, and the book is curiously devoid of genuine emotion.  Unlike the British critics, I'm not embittered nor angry at Sebold for writing the book, merely disappointed.   Some observers expected the novel to receive a National Book Award nomination; I'm not surprised it has not.  Should you read it?  Fans of James Patterson-style splatter novels will be disappointed; this book is a cut above such thrillers.  Readers seeking an accomplished literarynovel would best look elsewhere.
B00004XPP0|5.0|that offers more fun, action, fantasy or adventure.  Although EMPIRE is the best of the three, these films are such a wonderful experience! (especially if you can manage to watch them back-to-back!!!)<BR>My only problem is with the new digital effects-  I would have been happier if Lucas et al would have simply cleaned up the color and sound, as is done with most DVD transfers...The films just don't need any tinkering!!! I prefer the originals (even the funny smudges below Luke's landspeeder).
B00006IUL7|5.0|...In Warner Bros.' 2002 release of \\"Insomnia\\", all but one opening scene is shot in British Columbia; amidst heady glaciers and gurgling waterfalls. At the absolute top-of-his-game, 62 year-old Al Pacino is riveting as Det. Dormer. His world-weary cynicism grows darker as the story unravels. Haggard and worn, Pacino's limpid eyes help complete a richly textured performance.  Comedian Robin Williams is restrained and straight-forward as the child-killer, Walter Finch.  It's a quantum leap from his role as the devious villian in the farcical \\"Death to Smoochy\\". Nothing funny here, his calculating murderer in \\"Insomnia\\" is threatening and ominous. \\"Momento\\" director Christopher Nolan has fashioned a tight psycological thriller that easily resonates back to the best of Hitchcock. Subtle, morbid tension builds with every sudden, jarring telephone ring. This new DVD is a beautiful, pristine anamorphic transfer.  Multiple commentaries, a deleted scene, 3 documentaries, and a photo montage are among the extras.  The DVD's crowning jewel is a rare 20-minute interview with Pacino himself. He spouts off on Francis Ford Coppola, \\"Serpico\\", and the magic of live theater...

0345349571|4.0|I read this book more then 10 years ago. I can recommend it to everbody interested in history but also in adventure. It really wets your appetite to read more about this period and ancient and medieval history in general. In meantime I read books about different facts in this book : &quot;1OO years war, battle of the Golden Spurs (1302), the last crusades, Burgundy.. two years ago I visited the castle of Enguerrand of Coucy in the north of France. I remember the words in the book about the big towers of the castle... and indeed it was like that!Although it is partly a ruin the castle is a superb example of a medieval fortress. Don't miss it when you're there..when I was there I thought &quot;Enguerrand was once here where I'm standing now!&quot;

B00006J3T4|4.0|Excellent work from the world's finest guitar player which showcases his talents as bluespicker and hard rocker, in the span of an hour. For those acquainted with his work, it is an ongoing challenge - and pleasure - to listen for the many guitar sounds on display. It has been awhile since he's done a really good song on a steel guitar, and here, we've quite a few. DEVIL BABY kicks things off with the trademark dialogue between his voice and the Gibson electric interlaced with the now-background, now-foreground steel Resonator we've known so well since ROMEO & JULIET. A reminder, again, that his nonchalant, almost sarcastic lyrics sound better when paired with echoing steel guitars.<br />HILL FARMER'S BLUES and A PLACE WHERE WE USED TO LIVE spread his voice down to its base and trickles piano in a way that no real blue tune ever did - which proves, yet again, why Knopfler has lasted for over a quarter of a century; he squirms the melody with his hands or with his voice, he trudges his way through the forest of rock, grabbing a leaf from the blues bush, another from the jazz vine, but keeps on going and you listen to him go with style and delicacy and gravitas. This builds up to what is the most delicious song on the album, QUALITY SHOE, a throwback to the Roger Miller era of KING OF THE ROAD, a classic it emulates while threading its notoriety in humor, \\"If you could use a change of pace/and be excused from the rat race/just take a look at what's on view/you're gonna need a quality shoe\\"<br />You must wag your head in unison as you sync to \\"you got your toecaps reinforced with steel/hard wearing sole and heel\\". I played this back 3 times before I moved on to the next tracks.<br />MARBLETOWN is rather strange, recalling his 2000 song SILVERTOWN BLUES from \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\" (a major disappointment), and tells me Mark's been listening to Bruce Springsteen a lot, lately. Alas, this is not a good song, and not in keeping with Knopfler's \\"style\\", although both he and The Boss have penned some outstanding songs you've never heard on the radio. Fast forward to the old-fashioned styled RAGPICKER'S DREAM, which is sure to become a classic Christmas song for those discerning listeners. We've all heard the expressions \\"aglow in the light,\\" \\"turkey and gravy, pie and ice cream,\\" and \\"gifts for each and everyone\\" but somehow hearing this is almost like discovering where the words came from or where they were meant to be. We move on to DADDY'S GONE TO KNOXVILLE, as pure country as one might have heard on the radio before Elvis. The rhythm pickin' is a clear nod to the late Chet Atkins and his cutting strumming and one can imagine oneself seated in a snowed-in inn with Mark lazily hatching it away behind the bar an hour or so after midnight on Christmas or New Year's Day. Which is why the album's epilogue, OLD PIGWEED, a mouth-watering pub treatise on old-world recipe simmering in Mark's resonating steel guitar feels like the cover on the \\"Mulligan stew\\" that keeps it warm for the inebriated \\"associates\\" mentioned earlier in THE RAGPICKER'S DREAM. I could go on about syncopation and counter 3s and skipped beats but that is what music afficionados will banter in a few centuries hence. Suffice it to say this is a satisfying Knopfler album which, truth be told, we've not had since \\"Golden Heart\\".<br />I'd always thought that as musicians get older they make the mistake of trying to stay on the road - think Mick Jagger - instead of resting their bones in the recording studio crafting the music they're best known for. Frankly, I could care less if Dire Straits gets together again. I'd much rather have a studio song from Mark or Mick or Bruce for the rest of my life - or at least the rest of theirs. This is not to say THE RAGPICKER'S DREAM is a perfect album. Tunes 7-9 are hard-rock slouchers which get boring quickly.

B00004Z4WR|5.0|Memphis (Cage) is a retired car thife.  He must steal 50 cars in 72 hours, or his brother gets killed.  With that said, the movie is a good action flick with plenty of nice car chases.  I don't get why people hate this movie.
0743216458|5.0|As you would expect from the title, this book is focused on the stories of the individuals who made up this \\"band of brothers\\". Stephen Ambrose based his account on personal interviews and diaries and letters written at the time, occasionally moving back to a larger view when he quotes from an official history or other text.<br />This is the story of Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 506 Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101 Airborne Division. A famous group in a famous unit, fighting from Normandy in the early hours of D-Day, through Holland in the spectacular failure of Operation Market-Garden and Belgium in a gallant stand at Bastogne in the Battle of the Bulge, all the way to Hitler's \\"Eagle's Nest\\" in the Austrian mountains, where the victors had a well-deserved feast of wine, women and song.<br />This is an incredible story, told mainly in the words of those who were there, and you can feel the fear, exhilaration, killing fury, bitter cold and biting hunger along the way. But ost of all you can feel the camaraderie of soldiers thrown together in a remote training camp in 1942, who trained and fought as a band of brothers and now, sixty years on, still maintain their closest friendships with each other.<br />In another sense it is a story of an amazing soldier - Second Lieutenant Winters, one of the founding officers of Easy Company, who ended up a Major commanding the battalion. He led his troops with coolness and courage, intelligence and humanity. He gained more than respect, he gained the love of these warriors, and he earnt it through common sense decisions in training and in combat. His decisions saved the lives of his men and cost the enemy dearly, and his small unit actions are still cited as textbook examples.<br />This book is chockablock full of infantry minor actions. Advance, assault, defence, withdrawal, patrolling and raiding - all told from multiple viewpoints in stark detail - the war in microcosm as seen by airborne infantrymen.<br />There are maps andpictures, an index and an epilogue describing the postwar careers of the men of Easy. This book stands alone as totally engrossing war story, but is also an essential companion to the magnificent HBO miniseries.<br />As a brutally, touchingly honest story of men at war, I cannot recommend this book too highly. It is an instant classic.
6304681496|5.0|Con Air is a great movie!  It's a fast-paced action flick filled with bloodly deaths and bodies that has \\"Larkin\\" written all over them.  Cyrus Grissom (Aka \\"Cyrus the Virus\\") takes over a plane that is carrying crooks and rapist, and a madman.  Cyrus calls the flight \\"Con Air\\" when him and others take over the plane.

B000068PQ0|5.0|O.K. I admit I've never heard of The Flaming Lips before I heard they were touring with Beck. And only after my brother listened to the album all summer and tell me about it several times did I venture out and purchase it. Immediately, the yoshimi battle part I took the air out of me. I've become a glutton for turning up the screeching part II battle full volume to get the full effect of dying robots!! And my vote for best radio hit you'll never hear on the radio is Ego Tripping, man just a perfect song. And fight test is just great. This is definitely a band I will have to do more investigations into and get some other albums, cause this is great stuff.<br />UPDATE:  I had the wonderful opportunity to see Beck and The flaming lips play a couple weeks ago.  This band is UNBELEIVABLY GOOD!!!!  I didn't know any of their other songs (Besides a major hit I heard a million times... tangerine/vaseline whatever song.)  Despite not knowing any of the music I was entranced and found their musicianship to be quite outstanding.  The drummer was stellar- playing a piano and then crashing down the world with huge barrages of sound.  AWESOME.  Then they came out and played Beck songs and it was incredible.  I saw Beck in his personal tour and then when he came around again, and the flaming lips really complimented the show perfectly.  My favorite highlight was \\"ROBOT ROCK\\" where they used a voice synth to play \\"Get Real Paid\\" from Midnight Vultures.  WOW (iknowyoureallywantitcauseyourdaddy'salwaysonitandheknowsjusthowtoflauntitIWANNAKNOWIFIMWORTHYOURTIME)<br />Wouldn't it be cool if Beck and The Flaming Lips recorded an album together?<br />I sure hope they release a LIVE album.<br />If any of them are reading this YOU BETTER RELEASE A LIVE ALBUM!!<br />...
B00003CXXS|2.0|We are yet on another trip to Jurassic Park.  This time, a couple is searching for a boy that is lost on the island.  Allan Grant (Sam Neill) is hired as a dinosaur expert.  On the island, there are new dinosaurs.  Why can't they stop making Jurassic Park movies?
B00006F7S4|5.0|I am a huge fan of the blues, so this album struck me immediately and continues Beck's work in the vien of Mutations, which was my favorite Beck album.  Since I've overlistened to mutations I guess this would be my beck favorite album now (but not really).  I was able to enjoy Beck's up close and personal tour with about 500 other souls here in Dallas, when I first heard paper tiger.  He mentioned something about strings on the recorded version and launched into this hauntingly beautiful song that impressed me on first hear (it takes a great song to hit you right away, most of my favorite music takes a long time to learn before I can really say whether its great.)  Anyway, this song ranks among Beck's best (although I may never get over nicotine and gravy) but it illustrates the extent of his creative genius.  This album is great, get it.
B00004U8H4|5.0|I watch the unrated DVD almost every week and it invariably never gets old.  No film can duplicate the wittiness, the black humor, the satire of the decadence and excess of the Reagan 80's, the sadism, the delusion of the megalomaniacal characters, the soulesness, the nihilism, the narcissism, &amp; the dichotomy of sheer madness and genius that is Patrick Bateman.  For anyone remotely fascinated by the movie even if you are not an avid reader, the Bret Easton Ellis book will cut you to pieces - pardon the pun.  The cast is dead-on(sorry again) from Christian Bale to Chloe Sauvingny to Reese Witherspoon to Jaret Leto to Willem DeFoe et al.<br />It is important... crucial really, that one must see American Psycho more than once to fully grasp the complexity that comprises Patrick Bateman.  View it as an investment, not merely a purchase.
0385720920|4.0|\\"Because nothing is as perfect as you imagine it.\\"<br />That summed up Choke for the first 150 pages or so for me(at that point I would say 2 stars), but unlike Fight Club and Survivor(which started so strongly), Choke rallied in the latter half with Palahniuk's signature sardonic wit and biting humor accompanied with great soundbites and quotes worth writing down for future regurgitation.<br />Choke proved sadistically humorous with the ongoing masochism that pervades throughout the ripe pages of Choke - confinement to the stocks for Denny in Colonial Dunsboro, the incessant choking of Victor, the starving of \\"The Mommy\\", and of course the countless sex acts of Victor including the oh-so painful... All of this embodies their escape from both reality and confrontation into their ostensibly safe glass houses: a very deluded 1734, a mental hospital where all is not as it seems, a multitude of unsuspecting restaurants, and the innumerable sex spots for Victor - all of which provide a supposed safe haven from the heartless and cruel real world. Palahniuk advances many themes throughout Choke, not the least of which mandates not to escape from reality, but instead to create your own new reality. Because escape isn't as perfect as you imagine it.
B00006JDVV|3.0|I thought the story was incredible. A great idea. Here's the problem: They wildly condensed everything into 100 minutes. This is due to \\"running out of a budget\\". I left the theater dumbfounded, baffled, thinking to myself \\"Why?\\" \\"How could you flat out ruin an incredible idea?!\\" The point to all my comments: THIS COULD HAVE BEEN AN EPIC TRILOGY. <br />The lack of dragon footage alone in this movie is dissapointing (a total of 7 whole scenes! Most of these are flashes of dragons flying by the shaking camera.) You can't see 'em clearly!  And when they DO show them crawling on land, it's for a measly 3 seconds at a time, leaving you straining to store the image in your mind and make something out of it.  One scene at the end has the camera panning through the streets like the male dragon is supposed to be in the frame, but he aint there, oh, he's been cut out by those hackers in the studio for some odd reason. Mconauhey's(sp) character could have lived till the end of the third film. I'll explain later. If you sit there and think, your imagination will go crazy, creating the trilogy in your mind, getting you angry at the producers(who ran out of cashola) of this botched, brilliant idea. <br />Here's the sum up of the great trilogy that could've been:<br />1)The dragons smothering the planet showing huge scenes of destruction. Like Independence Day, but not New York/some other cities.(focusing primarily on London and USA / Bale and Mconauhey characters) You know, Quinn growing up and becoming a leader.  Van Zandt leading his crew in America, deciding to go to London.  <br />2)Van Zandt journey to Europe, then 3 quarters of the actual film we all saw. Ending with the idea of tracking and killing the male dragon.<br />3)The quest for the male dragon. Killing the male dragon(Mc's character dies here). The ensuing fight for survival with the remaining dragons that still roam the earth, summarized into 40 minutes. <br />Done, there it is. Too bad nothing like this will everhappen. This film froze the idea in time, condensing it into one film, never to be expanded and done correctly.
B000000WCV|4.0|This CD contains two of the greatest and grooviest \\"Electronic\\" songs of all time!  As far as the rest of the CD.

These guys just wanna have fun!  Check this out, I think everybody likes these tunes!
B000059MEK|4.0|I kinda have a hard time grabbing the whole &quot;Disco Funk&quot; brand of &quot;Electronica&quot;, but Daft Punk love what they do and I like them for that!  &quot;One More Time&quot;, is definitly the high point of the CD, buy 'ya know, this CD is fun.  If you liked &quot;Homework&quot;, you will probably like this album better.  If you like &quot;One More Time&quot;, you will love this CD.
6305807086|1.0|I'm a fan of John Malkovich and when I heard that he was going to be in the movie that bore his name I had to see it.  Aside from a couple of parts where Malkovich is actually on screen (\\"Malkovich, Malkovich\\" and the Charlie Sheen cameo), this movie is dreary, unsettling, and for the most part pure trash.  Not creative trash, mind you, gratutious \\"let's push the envelope and impose our own sick fantasies on the public\\" trash.  This movie has nothing much to say aside from wasting our time showing how a pack of not-so-nice low life people sink even lower while engaging in sick sexual fantasies and backstabbing each other.  It wasn't entertaining nor thought-provoking, just provoking; a dismal and self-involved effort that wastes a couple of hours of your life when you could be doing something much better than fill your mind with this trash. I didn't even watch it to the end.  Two-thirds of the way through was all I could stomach.
B00006AG5N|5.0|30 fantastic tracks!<BR>The king is not dead!
6305428387|5.0|This is the movie my family and friends quote most often. It has some of the best lines ever and they always remind you of the hysterical characters. John Candy is the best and very endearing in this film. Sanka, Derice, Yul and Junior are a real team and you become infected with their enthusiasm and energy. The soundtrack is also awesome and worth buying. Altogether, this movie makes my top 10 list- watch it and found out why!
B00003CWTI|5.0|How do you follow up a brilliant two and a half hour film about the 70's porno movie industry and the interpersonal relationships of the people who are part of it(\\"Boogie Nights\\")? If your writer/ director, Paul Thomas Anderson you create a brilliant three hour opus titled \\"Magnolia\\", involving a television quiz show and nine desperate, lonely, interelated characters.This is sort of the film version of the pop culture game, \\"The Six degrees of Kevin Bacon\\".But instead of Kevin Bacon, everyone has some sort of connection to a Jeopardy style game show. Some characters are intricately involved with the show, while others have a fleeting connection.The movie introduces us to a lonely police officer, a sexist motivational speaker, a dying old man, his unstable younger wife, a male nurse,a drug addict,a has-been former child celebrity, a game show host and finally a child prodigy.Besides the TV program, all these characters share that they are in desperate, lonely, pain (emotional,physical or sometimes both).All these characters feel that they have love to give, but they just don't know where or how to place it.They have all made mistakes in the past and they want a second chance.As John C. Reilly's lonely cop says, \\"sometimes people need a little help, sometimes they need to be forgiven, that's a tricky call\\". P.T. Anderson has crafted and structured an amazing film. In the first forty minuets, everything seems messy and all over the place. With lightning speed pacing and cross cutting he presents us facts about all nine people.But as time goes on, the pacing slows down and we strip away layer apon layer (or petal after petal) and learn about what motivates these people. You would think that this would be a depressing film, but it actually has quite a cathartic feel to it (especially the very stange, out of nowhere, ending). The wonderful script is brought to life by a great ensemble cast.Standouts include Julianne Moore, Melora Walters, John C. Reilly, William H.Macy and Tom Cruise. But to be honest all the actors give fantastic performances.Special note should also be made for the wonderful soundtrack made up of songs written and sung by  music artist, Aimee Mann. Supposedly these songs inspired Anderson in writing this film.The DVD of the movie is superb. It has a wonderful clear picture and sound. There is a whole second disc packed with extras including an hour and a half, detailed, video diary of the making of the film. This is a great DVD and a must for fans of good drama!d Tom Cruise.

0345448898|1.0|NOTE: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS.<br /><br />'His Dark Materials' turns the Christian view of the world upside-down. 'God' is actually an evil, controlling spiritual being/angel who Pullman calls 'The Authority'. Get it? Authority is bad. God is bad. The Church is bad. Eve's 'sin' was actually not a sin at all. She was 'tempted' to 'freedom' by a good spirit who appeared as a serpent. 'Freedom' is good. 'Sin' is good. I don't usually use so many 'scare quotes', but Pullman chooses a moral orientation for these books which is almost entirely contrary to classical Christianity. I hate that teens and kids are getting this totally slanted view reading these 'Young Adult' books.<br /><br />I'm not suggesting that Pullman has an anti-Christian agenda. But the worldview of these books is strongly anti-Christian, at any rate. In some ways, the results might be worse, since the 'values' are so subtle.<br /><br />I'll be the first to admit, the Church has done a lot of bad things. I'd agree with most of Pullman's examples. But his presentation of God/the Church/Christianity is a caricature. He presents none of the good things. I hope Pullman just doesn't know. Otherwise, his selective use of information is misrepresentation.<br /><br />We need to criticize the Church when there is evil in it, or even wrong-doing. But to caricature the Church as all evil and all wrong is false. It amounts to propaganda before unformed young minds.<br /><br />Pullman takes the common tack these days of coming up with supernatural providence that is bigger than us, but smaller than God. His device is that 'dark matter' (thus 'His Dark Materials') is conscious and good. It's not much different from Lucas' 'midichlorians' in 'The Phantom Menace'. GK Chesterton said 'It's not that atheists don't believe anything, it's that they'll believe anything.'<br /><br />I read this story all the way through to the end, hoping it would improve, hoping against hope that some turn would take place. But it didn't. It got worse. In the end we have 12 year old sex basically functioning in a redemptive way for a whole universe (and maybe all of them, I didn't read it that closely). You've got to be kidding. And this man has children of his own. This must just be his own wish nostalgic adolescent sex-wish coming out. None of us wants our twelve year olds having sex, right?<br /><br />Good story, interesting plot devices, fetching characters...and an infernal worldview. It's not wrong to criticize Christianity or to say you don't believe. But to say everything in Christianity is evil and wrong is false at best, and evil and wrong in itself at worst. The product, at any rate, is inexcusable.ear old sex basically functioning in a redemptive way for a whole universe (and maybe all of them, I didn't read it that closely). You've got to be kidding.

B000002J6H|4.0|Stills not the most accomplished member of CSN&Y? Where do you find your editorial staff? Having seen the band during this year of 2002 was an eye opener. Stills is still the best, and his guitar duels with Neil Young are more fascinating than ever. Crosby and Nash have always been so insubstantial within the context of the group, they could be hired guns.<br />This album is a glimpse of Stills at his early finest, and I'd recommend it not only as a testament to the past, but as a continuum of work whose creator is still here and producing.
B000002VRZ|4.0|In response to Dave Kelley: I just saw your review.  The name of the album from the mid-90s that you mentioned is &quot;Soldiers of Fortune&quot;.  I've been looking for it for years as well.  They have a newer album called &quot;So Low&quot;, which my son found for me.  It's tremendous, I think, but not as tight as their older stuff.
0375823360|5.0|I have only finished the first in this trilogy, but that first book was packed with adventure! I enjoyed every minute of it, and became genuinely concerned about all the characters. The story is fast paced, and imaginative. I would reccommend this book (these books)to everyone with a wild imagination. This author is certainly deserving of a lot more press and attention than he is getting!!
B00003CXXM|5.0|I won't tell u about the story plot(as i see everyone else has). THis was an exciting suspenseful movie, awesomely done by matt damon. It includes a great car chase, and many other suspensful scenes that will keep you on your seat. I recommend it to EVERYONE! The acting was done very well also.
B00004RF98|3.0|I hate to rain on anyone's parade, but after hearing that this was one of the best movies of all time, maybe my expectations were too high. It's easy to see how it was done: a bunch of old songs were collected and then a thin plot was created to string them together. There are some fun musical numbers and some great dancing, but the whole thing feels very pieced together. If you believe it's possible for a musical to sing, dance, AND tell a good story, this one may disappoint.
0446608955|5.0|This was an awesome book!  It was almost nothing like the movie, but you still went through every emotion there is.  I don't even know how to describe how wonderful this book was!  It's a must read!!!
B0000069NC|5.0|We are fortunate to have a wealth of fine performances by Bill Evans to enjoy.  Standouts are almost all of the Riverside trio performances (including the benchmark Village Vanguard discs with Scott Lefaro and Paul Motian), as well as the superb &quot;Turn Out The Stars&quot; box set with his last trio featuring Marc Johnson on bass and Joe Labara on drums.<br />&quot;At The Montreux Jazz Festival&quot; ranks with these stellar recordings.  Jack DeJohnette is, in my opinion, one of the finest drummers (and musicians) we have, and even at this early stage (1968)he is mature and musical like almost no one else can be.  Gomez was at a career high, and Evans's playing exceeds his usual fantastic standards.<br />Verve did a fine job with the 20 bit remastering, and included the entire set list.<br />Any fan of jazz piano trios should have this disc!
B000066NW0|5.0|So glad I didn't let previous reviews sway my decision to buy this CD! I went looking for this CD after I heard \\"Complicated\\" on the radio and saw Avril perform at the MTV Video Music Awards. Has it been overplayed? Perhaps, but if I really like a song, I don't get tired of it just because it is played on the radio 10 times an hour. This is how I felt about \\"Complicated\\". I have the CD and I still can't get enough of it. My first thought was of Alanis Morissette, but Avril's clearly got a style of her own. I also like that she has written the songs and has not caved to studio pressures to conform to a certain style. Her voice alone makes this CD worth having. Favorites: \\"Complicated\\" (of course!), \\"Losing Grip\\", \\"I'm With You\\" and \\"Anything But Ordinary\\"...though I like them all. Rock on, Avril!
0425173755|5.0|As a child, I first took notice of Agatha Christie when I saw the film version of \\"Murder on the Orient Express.\\"  I was hooked, and spent many of my years growing up reading Chrisite mysteries.  \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" remained one of my favorites because it is highly original, and while the ending is a shocking surprise, Chrisite is totally fair with her reader.  Chrisite reins over the British cozy mystery, which is an intellectual puzzle, and largely without much violence or blood.  Chrisite is also known for being easy to read, and can be enjoyed by young as well as adult readers.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|This is the best female album in years.  The best of the ninties definately.  Better than Alantis Mooresette, Tori Amos, any other female artist undoubtably.  This Fiona Apple album is superior to Tidal lyrically, musically, and in quality.  No filters, at all.  Excellent.  Fiona experiments with different beats and sounds in this one, and is very much successful.  It is more upbeat than Tidal, but don't let the drums and bass fool you.  It is much more dark than Tital lyrically, and only less dreary and boring.  Though there are no Sullen Girl's on this album, Fiona is still just as dark and depressed, only it is done with a deeper experience and machore beauty at suits her well.  Some slower songs are I Know and Love Ridden.  I recommend this to anyone who is a lover of music.  This album is every aspect of music at it's best.
B00006HBUC|4.0|Hi!  I bought this movie on DVD for my four year old son.  He absolutely loved this movie!  This is the only movie that he has ever sat through and watched completely without ever getting up.  He watches the movie two to three times a day since we got it the day it came out.  He is a big Scooby Doo fan.  Shaggy and Scooby are really funny in this movie and are the best parts about it, in my opinion.  The only thing I didn't really care for was the ending when they find out who was terrorizing the island, they could have picked someone else.  We only have a DVD player on our computer so when my son gets done watching the movie, he has fun playing the game as well.  Even if we would have gotten this movie on VHS, I am sure that he would still watch it as much as he does.  All in all, it was a great purchase for my son and it will and has been worth the money!!

B00000DQSS|5.0|Kate Bush third LP never Forever seems a bit overlooked in a way. Kick Inside is known as the singers debut LP. Lionheart which is often reffered as one of her weakest work seems though always on the shelfs when you look for a kate bush cd in a record store, the dreaming which has often had mixed reviews but some say her masterpiece. Hounds Of Love which is her of course her best known LP. but this album is often overlooked and i dont know why cause it his beautiful. The fist note on Babooskha and you are some place far far away. This LP has beautiful sound to it and is easy going. it is my 2nd favourite Kate Bush Album (hounds of love my favourite) and deserves notice everywhere. Kate Bush is a genius and this LP is brilliant. She was only 22 ( take that Britney s and christinas)
B000003TSP|4.0|All Mine is simply brilliant, a great song worth buying the whole album.  Only Only You, and a few others attracted me, but I think the one song makes it worth buying.
B00006CYAD|5.0|I LOVE SIMPLE PLAN THEY ROCK GET THIS CD IT'S GREAT
B00005B4GU|5.0|I just ordered Kid A, but I haven't had the chance to listen to it yet.  After ordering The Bends, I was disapointed with it.  I think Amnesiac is the best so far.  The Pyramid song is beautiful, and there are many others such as You and Who's Army starts off slow, then ends in a dramatic bellowing that is impacting.  Knives out, is good, and Dollers and cents.  But the best is definitely Amnesiac/Morning Bell, Pyramid Song, and Who's Army.  A great album.  The best I've heard so far from Radiohead anyway.
B00004HYLF|5.0|This is it!!! This is the album that you would take on that hypothetical deserted island.<BR> <BR>     Not only is this one of the best albums ever made, this was the best concert I ever attended. I saw them in Richmond at the Mosque theater in 1976. The applause following each song was just as long as the song. If you collect either jazz or rock, this is a must have.
B00006IUL7|5.0|Director Christopher Nolan hit artistic and cinematic paydirt with his underappreciated, &quot;Memento&quot;.  This latest effort is different in style and story, but repeats all the same mysterious character flaws in a landscape that's as beautiful as it is foreboding.<br />Pacino, Williams and Swank all deliver spectacular performances and Pacino is incredible as the &quot;respected&quot; high ranking detective who has terrible secrets only to accidentally get in deeper.  His consience keeps him 'awake' and his craggy face and tired eyesacks show it.  Williams is just as creepy and frighteningly clever in his role, never reminding you that he is also a comedian.  Swank plays the young, awe-struck cop with ease, who also faces a problem of conscience as she gets to know her mentor, Pacino.  This secrecy and disallusionment seems to be the motif Nolan sets into the characters.<br />The scenery is spectacular, but also, as shown in several scenes, not to be trusted - just like the main characters.<br />It's a tension filled, medium action film that will keep you mesmerized until the end.  It doesn't matter if the ending is slightly predictable, it's the ride that matters.<br />DVD includes all the typical Director's commentary (very interesting), making of documentary, theater trailers, etc.  Best of all is a sequence into the life of an 'insomniac'.  It gives the story all that more credibility.

6305696071|5.0|I don't know of anyone who hasn't seen this movie and I know very few who didn't like it (those few were men).  This is a classic Cinderella tale gone awry with beautiful Cinderella being played by a hooker.  Julia Roberts pulls off both aspects wonderfully.  Richard Gere is a great choice for a costar as he really fits the bill of a suave businessman.  The premise is pure, but the plot is seedy.  Julia is a prostitute with big aspirations squelched somehow by society, seemingly leaving her only this foul choice to make a living.  Gere is a filthy rich businessman who is out of town and needs a date for a dinner party.  Oddly, he thinks a hooker is the logical choice.  Yet, it works.  Julia fumbles through the etiquette of a world unfamiliar which lends the humor to this romantic comedy.  The chemistry between Roberts and Gere provides the romance that made this movie so very famous.  A star the size of Julia Roberts is not born of a bad movie.  This is a must-have.
B00006C79E|5.0|Saint Etienne keeps getting better at being Saint Etienne.  Finisterre has all the styles fans have come to love album after album: '60s pop, dance, international electronica, with a return to the beats, filmic references, melodies, grooves, and verbal intros of their earlier work.  I heard echoes of the albums Foxbase Alpha, Continental, and, in terms of keyboards, The Misadventures of Saint Etienne.  It's music for the head and heart.  The cold cover art doesn't really reflect the affecting songs contained within.  The album is packed with good taste, smart choices, and a creamy warm middle.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|When an Intelligent Alien from another planet, ended up, being stuck in Earth by Accident. But the alien ends up meeting a sad lonely boy (Herny Thomas), who immediately become in touch with him and start an different (unusual) kind of friendship. Since the adverse creature is slowly dying on Earth needing to go back to his Planet. Needing the boy help with his older brother (Robert MacNaughton) and younger sister (Drew Barrymore) become attach to the extra-terrestrial without thier mother (Dee Wallace Stone) knowing about it. But there's a gouverment surreptitious agency (lead by Peter Coyote) knowing that the alien is somewhere out there in thier planet.<br />Directed by Steven Spielberg (The Sugarland Express, Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind) made an instant classic with this unique One of a Kind sci-fi tale with a nice sense of humor and this also become One of the Highest Grossing Films of all time. Expectional Performances by Thomas and the E.T. (Created and Design by Carlo Rambaldi) makes this film so unexpected believable. In some ways, this film reminds you of Spielberg's early film-Close Encounters and the most recently (Which it did remind me most) Artificial Intelligence, including John Williams:Oscar Winning score. There's some touching moments in this also and some comical scenes also. This updated reissue version has 5 minutes of additional footage (deleting shots of the scene-where E.T. and the Kids are startle by the shot-gun and  replacing hand-guns with walky talkies), it's doesn't change the film that much. DVD's has great anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer on the Extended Version with new Visual CGI Effects and the Original Release. E.T. is also has great Digitally Remastered Soundtrack on the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in DTS and Dolby Surround) including a live premiere score by Williams in the new edition. DVD 2-Disc set extras are great. This is one of these films that, it will never aged or never forget. Re-live this unforgettable classic. Oscar-Winners for Best Sound and Best Visual Effects. It was also nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Editing, Best Cinematography. Written by Melissa Mathison (The Indian in the Cupboard) also recieve an Oscar nomination. Great entertaining for all ages. Grade:A.
B00006690G|3.0|I must say I was vehemently opposed to eminem on previous reords, found him in bad taste.<br />But after I heard White America I knew something had changed for the better.  This album is more of a platform to inspire others than previous undirected rage.<br />As a previous Eminem-hater my favorite track list is a little different:<br />My favorite songs are:<BR>1. White America - I guess I'm not the only one who thinks america needs some help.  It's almost useless to express my views on it because I may as well be talking to sheep.  Nice to have an ally in the most unusual spot.<BR>2. My Dads Gone Crazy - I don't find Hailie annoying at all and it has some pretty funny lines (Suck it Marshal)<BR>3. Superman - Unrelentless<BR>4. Business - Quick to the rapmobile!<BR>5. Without Me - I don't listen to the radio apparently this is overplayed.  The music video is wicked.  Nobody listens to techno?<br />In stark contrast to my dislike of his earlier albums, I don't think this album is angry enough, apologetic songs like When The Music Stops (caved in like reindeer hoofs? wtf) and the \\"just kidding\\" line at the end of white america are pretty tame.  They seem inserted to prevent lawsuits.  Cleanin Out My Closet is pretentious and gets old fast, Drips is just in bad taste.

Baird, Rhett Resse and Jonathan Roberts (The Hunchback of Notre Dame, James and the Giant Peach, The Lion King).

0517189542|5.0|In Little Women, you will meet the March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth & Amy who live with their mother, Marmee, and their maid Hannah, during the Civil War. The first half of the novel takes place while their father is away, serving in the war. Each sister has a distinct personality, a reader, an artist, a musician, the quiet one. You will get to know this family in touching little stories of their daily life. Each chapter seems to set up a moral lesson for the reader to learn. We also meet a wonderful set of neighbors, Mr. Laurence and his nephew \\"Laurie\\" who quickly find a place as part of the March family.<br />The second half of the novel, focuses on the girls as they leave their childhood and begin their journey into adult life. Lessons of friendship, family, and love are covered as we join the characters through the ups and downs of life, good times and bad. It seems that Louisa May Alcott used her own family as the basis for the stories in Little Women, basing the character Jo on herself. It is amazing how though the book was written in the late 1800's, so many things about humans remain the same. The foundations of life that are important in friendships, family & love don't change through time, as Alcott has shared with us. This is a book that young and old can read and appreciate.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|The music on this soundtrack ranges from weird to wonderful and back again. I'm a big fan of David Bowie's music, so I really bought the soundtrack for Nature Boy and the Beck cover of Diamond Dogs (which, by the way, is kind of odd but very cool). There's a lot of fabulous dance music on this CD, and some really interesting vocals by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor (who is not only a talented and attractive actor but has a beautiful singing voice). Lots of neat covers, the best of which are within the Elephant Love Medley. I really like this CD but it is very strange, which is why I gave it 4 stars. A little weird for me sometimes.

B00002SSKI|4.0|This is one of my favorite films of all time. Four friends growing up in suburban Indiana; tomboy Roberta (Christina Ricci), future celebrity Teeny (Thora Birch), writer Samantha (Gaby Hoffman) and fat, goody-goody Chrissy (Ashleigh Aston Moore) spend the best summer of their lives in 1970 and make a vow to return to each other when they need each other. Twenty-five years later the women (Rosie O' Donnell, Melanie Griffith, Demi Moore and Rita Wilson) return to their Indiana town where Chrissy (Wilson) is pregnant. A great coming of age film with lots of sentimentality and adolescent discussions about sex (surprise!). <br />A-
B00005J6T0|5.0|After the release of her second album Like A Virgin, Madonna established herself as the best female artist in the world with the release of her third album, True Blue. Not that her first two albums weren't good, Madonna was sick of singing fluff and wanted to be taken seriously in the world of music. True Blue was released at the height of Madonna's worldwide popularity and topped the UK album chart for 6 consecutive weeks. It was the biggest selling record of the year, and to back this up even more, it went straight to No.1 in EVERY country it was released in! Like A Virgin sold 19 million copies worldwide and spawned massive No.1 hits in countless countries worldwide. If Madonna thought she was successful, she was in for a big surprise with her True Blue album...<br />The album opens with Papa Don't Preach (10/10). This was the second single to be released from True Blue, where it peaked at No.1 both in the US and UK in June 1986. The single was a sure-fire hit, as millions of worried teenage girls around the world could relate to what sort of message the song was putting out. Many artists have copied this style in their songs, most recently Britney Spears in her smash hit I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman. Papa Don't Preach is full of emotion and features some serious singing from Madonna - something that would've been unthinkable a year previously. Critics were eventually willing to give Madonna the credit she deserved for singing such amazing songs and writing such heart-felt lyrics. Track 2 is Open Your Heart (9/10). This was the fourth single to be taken from True Blue, where it peaked at No.4 in the UK in December 1986. Out of all the five single releases on this album, this is definitely the weakest. The song is a good pop song, but just doesn't have that \\"wow\\" factor that songs such as Papa Don't Preach and Live To Tell possess. Track 3 is White Heat (8/10). Dedicated to James Cagney, this song has an interesting bouncy beat, along with a catchy bassline that makes you want to click your fingers, nod your head and tap your feet! All these factors make for a great song, but is let down by all the talking in the background and at the beginning, which gives reference to a sort of \\"cops and robbers\\" TV show of the late 1970's. Track 4 is Live To Tell (10/10). On most Madonna albums, there's the big power ballad - for True Blue, it's this one. This song was the first single to be taken from True Blue in April 1986 where it peaked at No.2 in the UK. While not the perfect choice for a first single from a new Madonna album, it definitely showcased her new, mature image - an image people loved, unlike the one Britney Spears is currently portraying. The heavy and haunting beat of Live To Tell is classic and Madonna's voice sounds superb. The factor that stands out the most on this song, however, are the lyrics. They are beautiful and heart-felt. \\"It will burn inside of me,\\" sings Madonna with a voice full of lost and longing as it sweeps across the stark arrangement of distant synth chords and lone guitar figures, seeking and holding secrets.<br />Track 5 is Where's The Party (10/10). In my opinion, this is the best unreleased song on True Blue. It's another typical, mid-80's pop anthem with catchy beats and bouncy bassline accompanied with fun and happy lyrics that everyone can sing along to. Track 6 is the album's title track, True Blue (10/10). This really is the definition of merry, camp and pop music. The lyrics are sweet and tingly, whereas the beat drives along at a steady pace. Madonna's voice is rather weak on this song and not as strong as on Papa Don't Preach and Live To Tell. This was the third single to be taken from True Blue and stormed straight to No.1 in October 1986 in the UK and US. Haven't seen the video? Trust me, you don't want to! It basically consists of a blue wall and floor, Madonna and two women, a white car and a lamp post! Track 7 is La Isla Bonita (10/10). This was the final single to be released from True Blue in April 1987 and - you guessed it - went straight to No.1 in both the UK and US. This is another one of the album's best songs. The song is light and wispful and features some amazing instruments such as the trumpet and guitar. They may be common instruments but when played in a certain arrangement, they can sound wonderful. Track 8 is Jimmy Jimmy (9/10). This is another unreleased track and has a fast beat with fast lyrics alike. The lyrics are a bit silly. Madonna tries to convince us who this Jimmy is, but she really makes no connection with the listening audience, if that makes any sense. Track 9 is Love Makes The World Go Round (10/10). This final song spreads a positive message about the state of the world and how it can be improved with aid and care - but not with violence through means of guns and bombs. The song has a great African tribal theme to it with lots of chanting from Madonna and her backing singers towards the end. Overall, a great song to end this epic album! Track 10, True Blue (The Color Mix) and Track 11, La Isla Bonita (Extended Remix) haven't been included on this review, as I own the original version - not the remastered version.<br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br />True Blue is an essential album for Madonna fans everywhere because it features some amazing songs, but more importantly the lyrics to the songs are emotional, heart-felt and have a depth to them that makes you think about what message Madonna is trying to get across.

0792839749|4.0|Fantasy movies are always a tricky sell to audiences- especially modern-day cynics, and that will probably never cease. But there are some green-lights to be mentioned in CCBB. I never read the book (which I imagine literary purists will hang me for), but what I found in the film was satisfying nevertheless. (I really only thought it to be too long when I was eight years old and when you're eight, fifteen minutes is too long.) On the other hand I was captivated with its story-within-a-story narrative- the blending of reality with fantasy. Some people here have complained about that blur, but that only enhances the fantasy of the film. The fantasy/reality blur reaches a pinnacle in the Act 1 finale with the Sally Ann Howes love song \\"Lonely Man.\\" (Is this part of the regular movie or the beach picnic story? Hmmm.) Other musical plusses are \\"Old Bamboo,\\" \\"Toot Sweets,\\" \\"Music Box,\\" \\"The Posh Life,\\" and a sparkling gem: Dick Van Dyke's simple bedtime song \\"Hushabye Mountain.\\" My only true complaint? The excessive, icky sweeteness of the two kids.

But then in one of my blow off classes at school We watched it- it was actually our exam grade, we watch it and we take a easy test over it.  I watched it and I loved it!  I hated her, and Now is is my favorite actress.  <br />The movie is basically about a Courtisan named Satine (Nic) and she falls for the writer Christian (Ewan) and they have to hide it because of the Duke who she has been promised to.  <br />The songs they sing are excellent.  I never would have guessed she had that In her.  I reccomend everyone give this a chance even if they hate the looks of it or someone in it.. you'll love it.

B000003TA4|5.0|Nevermind is easily one of the best rock albums of all time.  Its greatness and longevity is due not only to the catchiness of the songs, but the incredible power of the music, both sonically and emotionally.  Nirvana, in some ways, was a blues band.  Their music is an expression of psychic pain, so honest and direct that the listener feels an intimate connection with the band.  Nevermind is too amazing an album to skip over any songs, so I'm going to review each one.<BR>       The record kicks off with the mighty \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", a song so powerful that MTV and radio couldnt ignore it, even though it flew in the face of the pop-metal bands that dominated the charts.  SLTS is an explosion of pent-up rage and frustration, while at the same time a great pop song.  The visceral intensity comes to a climax with Kurt screaming the words \\"a denial\\" repeatedly at the top of his lungs.  <BR>        The next track, \\"In Bloom\\", is a poppy song that follows the same soft/loud format of Teen Spirit.  The verses begin with Kurt wearily singing lyrics about decay and fertility.  The tension builds, and suddenly we're blind-sided by the instantly catchy chorus about a macho, gun-toting man who \\"likes all the pretty songs\\" and \\"likes to sing along\\" but \\"knows not what it means.\\"  <BR>          Nevermind takes an unexpected turn with \\"Come As You Are\\", a softer, murky-sounding tune with exceptional lyrics and melodies.  The lyrics are a big mish-mash of contradictions, telling us to \\"come doused in mud, soaked in bleach\\" and \\"as a friend, as a trend, as an old memoria.\\"  The song's ethereal atmosphere reaches a breaking point in the bridge, one of the most transcendent moments on the album.<BR>        \\"Breed\\" picks up the pace a bit, and puts the focus back on rocking hard.  \\"Breed\\" doesnt follow the soft/loud dynamic, but its a great song nonetheless, an energetic punk song hinging on a monstrous riff.<BR>         \\"Lithium\\", although a top 40 hit, is probably the most bizarre song on the album.  The chord progression during the verses and choruses is quite odd, and contrapuntal to the vocal lines.  Despite this, the melodies are beautiful, and work perfectly, making it unforgettable.    Lyrically, the song is a 1st person account of a nervous breakdown.  However, the lyrics arent overtly disturbing, but rather, pleasant and sometimes even uplifting.  <BR>         \\"Polly\\" is Nevermind's first acoustic song.  The melodies slow and gentle, the vocals relaxed and draped in simple harmonies, at its surface \\"Polly\\" is a very peaceful song.  But somehow it gives a subtle feeling something isn't quite right, which perfectly underscores the song's lyrics.  The lyrics tell the story of a young girl being kidnapped and tortured and interestingly, they are sung from the offender's perspective. <BR>         The next tune, \\"Territorial Pissings,\\" is an all-out punk rock scream-fest.  It has 3 chords and only a handful of lyrics.  Yet even in the midst of all the punk angst, Kurt manages to get a nice little melody off in the verses.  As the song draws to the close, Kurt gives it all he's got, eventually reducing his voice to a strangled cough.<BR>         \\"Drain You\\" is arguably the most upbeat and positive song on the record.  The entire thing has a confident and triumphant feel to it, particularly the powerful, sing-along chorus.  \\"Drain You\\" is Kurt's interpretation of love, and the lyrics reflect on it from a romanticized view (\\"With eyes so dilated I've become your pupil\\") as well as a realistic one (\\"Chew your meat for you, pass it back and forth...\\").  \\"Drain You\\" also features a nifty Zeppelin-like bridge.<BR>         Track number 9, \\"Lounge Act\\" is a classic, straightforward pop song, even though Kurt screams the last verse and chorus.  The title is somewhat fitting, since most of the song is laid back and chipper compared to most of Nirvana's material.<BR>         \\"Stay Away\\" opens with a punishing drum roll from Dave Grohl and then explodes into a dark and driving punk song, that nevertheless features the dynamic soft/loud format.  With its anthemic refrain, \\"Stay Away\\" rivals \\"Territorial Pissings\\" in punkish rage...\\"On a Plain,\\" which shares the same triumphant feeling of \\"Drain You,\\" is possibly the most well-constructed tune on Nevermind.  The verses begin with a somewhat dazed-sounding melody, suddenly interrupted by the brilliantly harmonized line, \\"Love myself better than you,\\" which gives way to a cathartic and catchy chorus.  \\"On a Plain\\" also has a magnificent bridge, which changes the mood and adds a new dimension to the song with a slower and dreamier melody it  Lyrically, \\"On a Plain\\" has many themes, each line profound and puzzling at the same time.<BR>\\"Something in the Way,\\" Nevermind's acoustic closer, is the simplest and arguably the most emotive song on the album.  It has three chords.  The verses are musically spare, and the way the lyrics are sung is breathtaking.  The chorus is adorned with simple harmonies and a lone cello, giving it a majestic atmosphere.  The lyrics, expressed through a metaphor homelessness, recount a period of Kurt's life when he was lonely and lost, and they instantly speak to the heart and soul of the listener.<BR>  These songs comprise Nevermind, an immaculate mixture of punk, pop, and hard rock that changed music when it came out and continues to inspire today.  And isn't that all we can ask of great music?
B00005YXZH|5.0|This is an album that will be under-appreciated this year, but years from now will be revered. I liken this to the following: Rubber Soul by the Beatles, Pet Sounds by the Beach Boys, Quadrophenia by the Who. This album has not left my cd player since August. It is now October.

B00006AG5N|4.0|This past summer my 8 year old son loved the movie Lilo and Stitch so much we saw it twice. Then we saw the soundtrack in a store, and he begged for it. After buying it and listening to it non-stop (including a five hour drive for a camping trip), my son declared &quot;That Elvis guy is pretty good.&quot;<br />So when this CD came out, we had to get it. My son and I both love it and have it on the CD player all the time. It's got enough &quot;lively&quot; songs to entertain a kid, and enough classics to please me. And we both love the bonus track &quot;A Little More Conversation.&quot; <br />I recommend this CD for any family whose kids like music.
0694003611|5.0|I wasn't especially impressed by the book (sacriledge, I know, based upon reading the other reviews), but from the first time we read it to our 2 year old son, he loved it!  He wants us to \\"read it again!\\" over and over!  So, that overrides my verdict--5 stars!
B000068CNX|5.0|ok, we all know the show is great.  the second season includes many of the moments when we fell in love with this show - it's like a trip down memory lane.  snippets of extra footage and some nifty dvd extras are a nice plus, too.<br />the dvd's are also put together well.  for example, there's a &quot;play episodes&quot; option on the main menu that runs thru all the episodes on the disc without interruption, and only playing the theme song on the first one - very smart!  some other dvd collections i have watched could learn a great deal from the friends people.<br />in any case, you'll get your money's worth out of these.  in some way, it's like watching your home movies - i mean, they're *my* friends, too!  :)
B00006F7S4|5.0|This is Beck's best album. Soft, sophisticated, soothing, and sad, it features much of the same idiosyncratic music you come to expect from Beck (though on a much more subtle level), only this time, it's combined with lyrics that are at the same time haunting and intensely personal. With every album Beck records, he seems to grow less and less uncomfortable with embracing his own feelings, or even his own talent; the &quot;hip&quot; ironic cynicism of Mellow Gold and Odelay gave way to the swingin party of Midnite Vultures, rather than speak above pop culture, he began to create his own pop culture. Likewise, musically, Sea Change recalls his '98 album  Mutations (as has already been written countless times), but while the former still had that sense of irony, that all he was really doing was creating sly joke that we were all in on, with Sea Change, it's no longer just a joke, the music is serious, somber, and beautiful. And his lyrics, which up to this point were usually in the &quot;brilliant but what the hell is he talking about&quot; vein, are much clearer, addressing real situations and real pain.<BR>The Nick Drake, early 70's brit pop influence on the album is most apparent on &quot;Round The Bend,&quot; which sounds a lot like Drake's &quot;River Man.&quot; The strings on this and other tunes add a nice melancholy touch to the proceedings, while Beck's band (largely the same band that accompanied him on Mutations and Midnite Vultures) continues to play with understated taste and good humor. Beck himself has never sounded better, his vocals are much more emotional, and his use of falsetto, on songs such as &quot;Already Dead,&quot; is beautiful, and unlike &quot;Debra&quot; or &quot;Peaches and Cream,&quot; it's not used simply for comic value or to impress the listener.<BR>This may be Beck's least commercial album, but like he cares at this point. He is almost a modern-day Van Morrison, shifting styles from album to album, generating a great fan base and critical reviews, and who will most likely remain best known for his one or two hits that barely hint at his actual abilities. Sea Change is a wonderful album, definitely worth a listen, and it shows that Beck is still improving as an artist, has yet to reach his peak, and it could yet be a very interesting ride.
0316666343|1.0|I first picked up this book at my boyfriends house and began reading out of curiosity.  After the first chapter I was hooked and bought my own copy the same day on amazon.com.  To my dissapointment the first chapter was the climax of the book. The middle of the novel was entertaining but moved less than quickly and I felt myself skimming past some of the ending chapters.  By the last chapter I was down right bored, what was the whole point of this book again?
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|It should be no surprise that any movie that has the title \\"Scary Movie\\" would become a favorite movie to watch on Halloween. And after the events of 9/11 last year, most people opted to watch Scary Movie because people wanted to laugh again and not endure any more horror after what they witnessed on the news. In fact, I asked some people, from children to adults, what their favorite scary movies were, and aside from the usual favorites (The Exorcist, Psycho, etc.) an overwhelming majority mentioned this movie.<BR>Scary Movie is basically a satire of several popular horror movies including I Know What You Did Last Summer, The Blair Witch Project, and Scream. The movie also pokes fun at several references to pop culture, but none of that really matters. The entire premise of Scary Movie is to have a good time and laugh, and that's what you are supposed to do on Halloween -- aside from scaring people or being scared.<BR>Scary Movie is rated R and contains a considerable amount of gross-out humor and foul language, but that's tame compared to what children already see.  I know children will enjoy this movie as much as adults.  If you are a parent, I highly recommend that you show your children this movie at their next Halloween party while they consume all that delicious Halloween candy.  Children may find some of the content in this movie shocking and offensive, but don't be surprised if you hear them shout, \\"WHAZZAH!\\"  After all, think about it:  Isn't a cartoon about a great pumpkin rising out of a pumpkin patch getting too cliche already?  Happy Halloween!
6301247485|4.0|It is often difficult to make an adequate movie of a great novel. In this instance, however, I am really not that disappointed in the final product although the film does have a few shortcomings.<br />Bruce Dern was not the best choice for the role of Tom Buchanan. He simply did not create a convincing portrait of the cruel monster depicted by Fitzgerald. Robert Redford as Jay Gatsby and Mis Farrow as Daisy Buchanan gave stronger performances. Sam Waterston also did a good job as Nick Carraway who serves as the story's narrator.<br />If you decide to read the book first, you will notice some of the minor deviations from Fitzgerald's original plot. Nonetheless, on the whole the movie is much better than average and I therefore recommend it.
0783225792|4.0|I worked for a Mississippi casino at the time this film hit the big screen.  Obviously, there are tremendous differences between Las Vegas casinos of the 1970s and Biloxi casinos of the 1990s--but even so I was stunned by the accuracy with which Scorsese's CASINO nailed the industry and the personalities that inhabit it.  From the slick hair and pin stripe suits to the endless profanity to the count room to the survelliance room, CASINO is uncomfortably close to the truth.<br />Based on the life of 'Lefty' Rosenthal, CASINO offers the story of Las Vegas' last gasp of mob domination before the big corporations began to move in.  Robert De Niro is \\"Ace\\" Rothstein, a mob-connected gambler who rises to control of one the biggest mob-owned casinos in town--and then sees his control slips away through his misplaced love for beautiful and brazen Vegas hustler Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) and his association with gangster Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci.)  And when their various activities begin to draw heat on the mob bosses, can murder be far behind?<br />The cast is really top notch.  De Niro and Pesci offer memorable performances, as does a superior supporting cast that includes James Woods, Don Rickles, Kevin Pollak, and Melissa Prophet, to name but a few--but the real laurels go to Sharon Stone, who plays out the rise and fall of the glamorous Ginger with surprising skill.  But even so, and in spite of its memorable cast, dialogue, plot, and production values, CASINO has a slightly awkward feel to it.  Part of the problem is the film's inconsistent reliance on voice-over narration that shifts uneasily between De Niro and Pesci; part of the problem is the film's uneasy shifting between love story and gangster movie.  And in the final analysis the film seems overlong.<br />For all its flaws, CASINO is an extremely watchable, very memorable movie that stands up very well on its own in spite of inevitable comparisons to GOODFELLAS.  In passing, I note the DVD package has few extras, and most viewers will be as happy with the VHS version as with the DVD.  But be it DVD or VHS, the film is strongly recommended.tras, and most viewers will be as happy with the VHS version as with the DVD.  But be it DVD or VHS, the film is strongly recommended.
0316776963|3.0|Page 141-200<BR> <BR>The collections of short stories in Me Talk Pretty One Day are still similar to the stories that I summarized prior to this. Each story is about something noteworthy that has taken place. The chapter begins on page 142, where David Sedaris writes about his dislike for computers, and all modern technology. The following story tells about how he met his partner and about his new home France. After getting together with his partner Hugh, Sedaris moves to France with Hugh, who lives there most of year. Mostly everything Sedaris does revolves around France, and Hugh throughout the rest of the story. Some of these things include Sedaris trying to learn French, and Sedaris's relationship with his friends and family. The next story is titled Jesus Shaves. This deals with Sedaris's opinions on religion. He questions why things such as why a rabbit was chosen to be the symbol of Easter. The following two chapters deal with his troubles of learning to speak French. One struggle was his inability of learning the correct verb endings. When he would purchase groceries he would always buy more than necessary in order to hide his embarrassment of not being able to understand the plurals of French words. The pages of 138-200 deal with his struggles.<BR> This collection of short stories lack a transition from his childhood in North Carolina and these later stories about learning French and living in Paris with his boyfriend. Luckily, the quality, and humor in each story are so great that the lack of a transition does not matter! The story titled Jesus Shaves is a great example of the quality of humor Sedaris writes because his opinions are so diverse and different from most others. Who would have questioned why a rabbit represents Easter, especially with humor? Sedaris questions anything he can, and does it well. He writes everything with humor, which is rare for a writer to do well. This made me appreciate his stories even more! I thought it was great when he wrote about his experience of learning French. He was determined and dedicated. Teachers that hated him, and would rather have a cesarean section than be with him did not stop his quest for mastering the language. I admire him for putting up with those sorts of things. I try to relate myself to him in that way because I believe it will make me try harder at things that are not effortless. The most astonishing thing is that this book can be so great, even though he has not done anything important to write an autobiography about himself.<br />1. Page 177, \\"He nice, the Jesus. He makes the good things, and on the Easter we be sad because somebody makes him dead today.\\" This quote symbolizes the title, Me Talk Pretty One Day. My interpretation of the title is that he believes he will not be heard until he can talk well. The quote uses bad grammar, and cannot show what the person is trying to say in the best possible way. The quote should really say something like, Jesus is superior because he makes everything good and on Easter we mourn his death. This would inform people much better because it uses better grammar.
B00006F7S4|4.0|Full fathom five thy father lies; <BR>       Of his bones are coral made: <BR>   Those are pearls that were his eyes: <BR>       Nothing of him that doth fade, <BR>   But doth suffer a sea-change <BR>   Into something rich and strange. <BR>                            <BR>                       The Tempest, Act I, Scene ii<br />Despite the truth of this, this is not a five-star album. First of all, the depressing folk songs are not my favorite side of Beck's dual personality. Still, this is GOOD. Not great, just good. Essentially, this is an attempt to remake anything by Nick Drake or Dylan's Blood on the Tracks, and it just can't reach those kinds of heights. Of course, bearing comparison to luminaries like Drake and Dylan make almost anyone look weak, so perhaps the comparison is not fair. The real weakness is the lack of really, truly memorable, classic songs. Beck has his fair share of those, but only &quot;Paper Tiger&quot; and maybe, with time, one or two others are going to join those ranks. <br />Of course, this record can only be appreciated after midnight when all your friends have abandoned you and the house is cold and quiet. If you don't often experience this, then Sea Change won't matter much to you. And if it does (I'm with you, brother/sister) then you can do better.<br />Still, Beck is my hero. Here's a kiss for him:
B00006IUNN|1.0|The weakness of the storyline and plot is surpassed only by the really bad acting of Nicholas Cage.  This man is truly the luckiest person in Hollywood. He lacks talent.  He lacks good looks. And he lacks charisma. He is capable of only two expressions, and both of them resemble a constipated hound dog. If he were not Coppola's nephew, he would be delivering Domino Pizzas. If it's possible, his performance in this movie is even worse than that in Captain Corelli's whatever. And Cage manages to do this without affecting a Dracula-like phony Italian accent. This movie is not worth even the modest rental charge. Windtalkers breaks wind.

B00003CWL6|5.0|I just watched \\"American beauty\\" on DVD, and I still draw the same conclusions about this film as I did when I first saw it, three years ago. The supreme talent of screenwriter Alan Ball and director Sam Mendes is evident at every turn. Kevin Spacey is perfect in the role of Lester Burnham, as are Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari, Wes Bentley and Chris Cooper in their respective roles. The situations, actions and misunderstandings may seem lightweight and even far-fetched by some standards, but they never seem contrived, and the film offers a distinct look at life within modern American suburbia. The strangest things can happen in the most mundane places, to the most ordinary-looking people, even on a street that you might find anywhere in America.<br />That the film remains dramatic and yet humorous is one of its strengths. The characters may be angry and miserable, but seeing them get the better of each other, their bosses, and others gives the film a satiric quality. But the message is more important than mere satire. Only after you consider the characters, their actions, how they wrestle deep-held apathy and begin to piece together some sort of meaning, do you begin to understand the full consequence of the film's tagline, \\"Look closer\\".<br />\\"American Beauty\\" is difficult to classify into one genre because it encompasses so many. There's mystery, dark comedy, film noir, and even romance, all set within a cynical, but heartfelt, story. You will also notice the plethora of similarities between this movie and Alan Ball's TV series \\"Six Feet Under,\\" including Thora Birch's character, the mothers played by Bening and Allison Janney, the Thomas Newman score, and the general mood. If anything, \\"American Beauty\\" seems like a prequel, or a companion piece, to the HBO series.<br />The DVD itself offers a behind-the-scenes \\"making of\\" featurette which is too short and, frankly, one of the most unexciting I've seen. I would have preferred to see more interviews ofthe cast members and the production team, talking about their experiences of making the film. However, this minor drawback does not detract from the overall worth of the DVD; the film's presentation is excellent and on the same level as other, similar disks for movies released in 1999.<br />Like other Oscar-winning films, you might watch this one and wonder, why don't they make more movies like this. \\"American Beauty\\" is an American classic, with equal moments of delight and tragedy. It evokes thoughtfulness, because it forces you to question your definition of beauty, and what you consider beautiful in life. Beauty, and the interpretation of it, is of key importance in nearly every scene. Watch especially for the reaction of a teenage boy, toward the end of the film, as he directly witnesses the result of a bizarre and gruesome murder. As the denouement of the film demonstrates, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
B0000029GA|5.0|Nas &quot;Illmatic&quot; is a classic. One of those cds that you can pop in years later, and enjoy like you just got it. All of the ten tracks on the album shine in what is definetly one of the best hiphop albums ever released. &quot;N.Y. State of Mind&quot; produced by DJ Premier has crazy beats, with piano tinges, and is a killer start to album. Next Nas and AZ collabrated on &quot;Life's a Bitch&quot; one of the illest collabs ever to come out. Next track is &quot;This World is Yours&quot; (Pete Rock produced), has Nas dropping Raw Lyrics, with crazy background beat. &quot;Halftime&quot; follows then another Primo track &quot;Memory Lane&quot; has Nas reminescining on growing up. &quot;One Love&quot; has Nas giving shouts out to lost/Jailed<BR>friends. The album finishes with &quot;One Time 4 your Mind&quot; (Large Professer&quot;, &quot;Represent&quot; (Primo) amd my favourite track off the album &quot;It aint hard to tell&quot; has Nas dropping lyrics to Jazzed up version of &quot;Human Nature&quot; by michael jackson. Illmatic is truly one of the best hiphop albums ever to come out, as a young Nas spits mad poetry, and keeps his listner addicted throughout. An album for every Rap Collection.
