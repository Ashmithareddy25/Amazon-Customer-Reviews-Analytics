B00005JNS0|5.0|We love Pixar animation in general, and are particularly fans of Cars. Our 3 year old son would watch it on a continuous loop if allowed.     The story is sweet and addresses loyalty, friendship (making and keeping), team work, and respect for the more experienced.    The music is great, there is as always funny adult things that make it entertaining.
0307387178|4.0|Into the Wild was just great.....I have always wanted to trek and adverture about, but find myself too old and not enought motivation.....Krakauer does a great job again of persuading me to be careful....after reading his into thin air, i wanted to visit everest but just stay at base camp.....
B00009MGGI|5.0|These stories are well written,well acted and produced. Everyone involved is a professional of the highest calibre. There is great suspense and surprise but not suited for younger audiences. I'd say over 17-18.
0151013837|5.0|GREAT read- and this edition has amazing illustrations. Life of Pi is a fantastic story about a boy stranded at sea in the company of a Hyena, Orangutan, a Zebra, and a Bengal Tiger. Pi must learn to face these animals as well as himself. **awesomeness**
B000BYRCGU|4.0|Wait, before you condemn this movie and categorize it as another \\"babe watch\\" show, take another look at Walker and Alba's underwater skills and the curious grey? reef sharks. I've never swum that close to even the placid white tip.  Lifting heavy objects using floatation device and transferring air from balloon mouth-to-mouth when tank is empty requires at least rescue certified skills.  I would be happy enough not to disturb the bottom sand for macro look.    I think this movie would appeal to most scuba divers or avid snorkellers.
B000I5X80G|4.0|Being a hardcore fan of NY perhaps I'm easy to impress ... I you are a fan this is one that you should buy. Note the rhythm guitar on 'Down by the River'.
B0014DBZT2|2.0|i've been a cave fan 4 20 years. n this is his worst cd 2 date, i want the bad seeds,!! not the good seeds.
0743201140|5.0|This a great book that will help you identify your signature themes.  THe book is an easy read and will definitely keep your attention.  Worth the purchase alone, just to have access to the StrengthsFinder poll.
B000007ODX|2.0|I agree with some reviewers.I have rubinstein's and barenboims recordings but Ivan Moravec's is perhaps the best available recording of chopin's nocturnes...
0143038419|3.0|I finally caved in to the tsunami of Oprah-bred hype and read this book - under duress by various females of my acquaintance. Expecting the usual literary self-help panacea, I was thrilled to discover a writer of some insight and wit...during the first two sections. I must confess, however, that I began to lose patience with the author during the the final third of the book for she succumbed to the temptation to rely on the trite, the hackneyed and the \\"quick-fix\\" tools that are too often employed by those who simply tire of their subject matter. Great beginning but a limping finale.
B000127LW2|2.0|I'm a big fan of this series, but I came to it late. Fortunately, that was well after this collection of stinkers aired. There are barely a handful of episodes with anything approaching original plots or concepts. Unless you are a diehard fan who'll watch anything as long as the characters wear Starfleet uniforms, I suggest you skip ahead to the fourth season or later.
B0015T5EE2|4.0|I am a big fan of Max Sepultura and of Soulfly, so when I found out the brothers reunited, I was stoked. I've been listening to this album non-stop for 3 days, and I can say I am totally glad I  bought it. This is straight in your face metal.Stand out tracks are INFLICKTED,SANCTURARY,TERRORIZE, AND IN CONSPIRACY.  I hink all the songs rock and I hope to hear more from the bros in the future.
B00132D808|2.0|The first time I encountered Panic at the Disco was at a show at The Big Easy in Boise, Idaho.  I was blown away by the energy and originality of their music.  Singles such as \\"I write sins not tragedies\\" and \\"Lying is the most fun...\\", while similarly energetic, had their own personalities.  It would take several different bands to produce the variety found on \\"Fever\\" alone, but \\"Pretty. Odd.\\", as the name suggests, lacks these positive qualities.  It appears as though Panic has opted to tread the path of a slower, folksier, sing-song style that reminds me of Simon and Garfunkle and the Rent soundtrack.  While this type of music has its place, and to Panic's credit the instrumentals are wonderful as always, I did not expect to hear it from them.  Unless this record begins to seriously grow on me, I fear it may go the way of other Second Album Syndrome sequels such Crazy Town's \\"Dark Horse.\\"
B00003CXIP|5.0|Stand by Me is probably one the strongest films about friendship ever made. It really does make its older audience travel back in time to when we were young and hanging out with our buddies planning to do something extraordinary for the summer. It is all about `coming of age', never over sentimental, yet remaining thoroughly heart rendering in its depiction of youths discovering their inner adult self.<br /><br />Written by Steven King, this is one of his `Shawshank Redemptions' stories that contains thrills and drama but no horror. The dialogue is superb and very memorable. The story revolves around four boys who overhear that a body of a boy who had been hit by train was seen by some riverbank. They head off on the two day trek and meet many obstacles along the way.<br /><br />This is also one of director Rob Reiner's best films. It stars Wil Wheaton (Wesley of Star Trek: The Next Generation fame), River Phoenix (who infamously died of a drug overdose), Corey Feldman (of The Lost Boys), Jerry O'Connell (Sliders) and Kiefer Sutherland.<br /><br />It is also more proof that Stephen King's dramas make much better films than his horrors.
0124297854|5.0|This  book is nicely illustrated. The mechanisms of named reactions are depicted in colors for easy understanding by the user.This will be a very good book for the beginners in chemistry as well for the practising chemists.The industrial & academic examples choosen for the name reactions will  give an indepth knowledge of the utility of the reactions. Overall I rate this book as a good companion for an organic chemist.
006135323X|3.0|I thought the book would be a little more fun reading.  I found it more formal information.  It gave a ton of examples when 1 or 2 would have sufficed.  A good book, it was what I was looking for, just a long read.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|Ahhh! it was so great. I couldn't leave it and had to watch it twice. Every moment in this show is magical. The sound is great and the show is unbelievable ('The storm'... no words to explain).
B000001FKY|3.0|Def Leppard's first 3 cds i though were great. Then this cd came out. Just seems more of a pop rock cd. I guess thats cool if you like that kinda stuff, but if you like heavier def leppard go get High N Dry or Pyromania. Both really good records.
B00005B1W5|5.0|A great show. After watching the Acropolis over and over again it was a great pleasure to watch this show. Although I had the CD long ago - watching it was a different story.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I hated it, all of it. I kept waiting for the movie to start.  Then I was waiting for the monster to eat all of the cast, especially the camera!  When I saw the credits I couldn't believe how many people were involved in making this awful DVD (can't call it a movie).  I was sure only 3 little kids had made it on a miniature Manhattan set.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Really this was the only excuse I could use so my wife would let me buy all the movies on DVD at the same time.  Great movies in both original and special edition formats.  All look great and sound better.  If you like these movies youll like this set.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|This movie is my favorite sci-fi end of the world kind of movie. Ive got like 3 versions of it on DVD and VHS and now on blu-ray. I didnt mind that it wasnt the extended version cuz the extra minutes didnt change the movie at all. They were just added moments to a cities destruction or about why the kids father doesnt like him so much or something. In any rate I definatly give this movie a 5 star rating.
0061474347|4.0|In the Old Kingdom, the daughters of Clayr all have the gift; all except one.  Lirael is \\"Sightless\\" while all the other women have the \\"Sight\\".  Already feeling like an outsider as her mother deserted her years ago, her difference leaves her even lonelier as she believes everyone seems to look down on her since she failed to move on two years ago like they all did.<br /><br />Now fourteen years old, Lirael releases a Stilken (female human crustacean from a glass- coffin).  That kindness leads Lirael to meet her great-great-grandmother, a renowned healer.  The elderly woman encourages her descendent to befriend the insolent \\"Disreputable Dog\\".  She and her disrespectful companion meet tense Prince Sameth, son of Sabriel (title star of the first book; not yet read by me).  This trio of alienated outcasts soon uncovers a plot to destroy the Old Kingdom.<br /><br />This is an intriguing reprint of a young adult quest fantasy that grips readers from the moment Lirael meets her ancestor and never slows down; in fact nothing critical is resolved by the end leaving the audience disappointed yet anxious for ABHORSEN.  The lead trio is solid fully developed characters with the two humans having anxiety issues and the dog remaining an unresolved enigma.  Newcomers and those who read the first tale will feel spellbound by the Old Kingdom's magical realm in which the paranormal seems normal.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B000ZBPQEO|4.0|Just wanted to point out a few things:    * 33 of these discs were recorded in mono, with three more discs containing some stereo tracks and some mono. So about 40% of the music on here is in mono, primarily from Karajan's EMI recordings with the Vienna Philharmonic and Philaharmonia Orchestra. Whether that bothers you or not is up to you. Personally, I do not plan on listening to the mono recordings more than once, if at all. Karajan's recordings here with the Berlin Philharmonic are in stereo.    * All of the older recordings are remastered. Most remasterings were done in the 1990s, although some as late as 2007. Certain recordings, notably the 1950s Beethoven symphonies, were remastered in 1989. For a full listing of tracks and remastering dates, there's a PDF you can download from the official Karajan 100th Anniversary web site.    Apart from those concerns, I'm glad to have this box set. Karajan himself recorded better versions of some of this material with Deutsche Grammophon, but there are still countless hours of discoveries and listening pleasure to be had from this convenient set.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|You know an album is good, when after a few years you go back to it and find it that exciting or maybe even a little more thatn when you first picked it up.<br />I honestly don't understand, or see how any RHCP loyalist or tradistionalist can call this album soft and weak. I mean even the weaker songs usually have a nugget of something that hooks you in. (i.e. Charlie)<br /><br />there are so many good songs and it so big, and sounds so splendid that, it just makes you want to start it over right when you get to the end.<br /><br />And the people that say \\"Dani california\\" is a rip off Tom Petty's \\"Last Dance With Mary Jane\\", you are retarded. It's a standard beat, with a somewhat standard melody. I think rubin would have pointed that out to them seeing as how he produced both songs. I didn't even think of that when I first heard it, i thought that the repeated guitar lick in the solo sounded alot like \\"Purple Haze\\".<br /><br />so there you go...  I love exploring this album and I think you should too.<br />Oh and by the way, I have been listening to them since the mid 80's. So it is nice to see a group of guys grow up into actual muscians of merit after just being novelty joke band.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie as it depicted various character types.  The types were not indepth, but sufficient to capture my interest.  I don't beleive the focus was show heavy fighting scenes but rather some of the complexities of the times and relationships.  It was good to see some racial diversity without race ever being an issue.  I watch this movie frequently.
B00062ZE44|5.0|I found this group completely by accident watching videos on youtube this is the first time in years that I've enjoyed nearly the entire CD of a band. Usually its one or two songs and the rest are crap or just okay. Not Within Temptation every song is incredable. Top of the list on this CD is without a doubt \\"See Who I Am\\" it has an absolute amazing sound and the lyrics are awsome. Same with Memories, Somewhere, Its the Fear, and Stand My Ground. I just can't say enough about this group. Their awsome.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|When I compare this HBO miniseries to other movies and shows I have viewed on TV, this certainly ranks in the top ten for me.  Others off the top of my head would be Band of Brothers, North & South, Shogun, War & Remembrance, Roots, Lonesome Dove.  This is truly in that rare company.    It may be good that I didn't read the book as I read those negatively jaded reviews here...but I can't think of any movie/video that can capture the imagination filled tapestry of a well written book....so judging a movie/mini-series from that standpoint has always seemed pointless.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|What a HORRENDOUS waste of time this is!!!  I have never felt sooooo cheated in my entire life! The most dragged out and boring piece of crap I have ever had the displeasure of watching. You know the boring scene in Pulp Fiction where they are riding around in the car talking?  That is this ENTIRE film! This was one of the most anticipated films and overrated films of all time.  This was just plain bad. The second worst movie EVER!!! That's right... if it wasn't for Slumber Party Massacre 2, this would take the top spot!!
B00003CXA6|4.0|To begin, I am not a student of the Civil War; however, I purchased the movie due to a recent and 1st time trip to the battlefield. The driving tour, accompanied by the audio CD, is a very inspiring and educational way to spend a spring day.    The movie appears to accurately portray the actual events of those three days of July 1863. I would, however, recommend watching the \\"making of the movie\\" sections first as the characters and events are difficult to follow without some preliminary study. Also recommend having a battlefield map at hand.    The movie plus the battlefield visit makes one realize how real and how tragic those three days were. A second visit to the battlefied is planned for the fall!!
B000GFLKEY|5.0|Awesome movie at a great price from Amazon!  They are super fast shippers and orders are always accurate!
B000SO7OM0|5.0|This is an incredible concert.  The musicians were perfect!  I thought the chello player was particularly gifted.  It was a delight to hear so many different and unique instruments.    I highly recommend listening to this.
0375714839|3.0|In the chapter \\"The Shabbat\\", set before she leaves for Austria in 1984, Marjane describes how Iraqi Scud missiles start raining down on Tehran, killing her Jewish childhood friend and neighbor, Neda.  However, according to Jane's Intelligence Review and other sources, no missiles reached Tehran before Iraq's Al-Husayn missile programme in February 1988.  Why would she lie about this?
B000N3ST8O|5.0|I admit, I'm a relatively new Stevie Nicks fan. I didn't REALLY get into her music until the last five or six years. And in that time, I've come to love and appreciate her as one of the greatest women in rock.    Being a fan who owns Enchanted, when I first heard she was going to release ANOTHER best of, I admit, I rolled my eyes. But as more information came out, I found myself getting more and more excited. And then when the press releases came out, I knew this one was going to be worth picking up.    First off, my comments on the CD. The sound quality is FANTASTIC. All of these songs have been beautifully remastered for spectacular sound quality. And while yes, original versions of her Mac songs would have been nice, and yes one can gripe about missing tracks like Beauty And The Beast, this CD does offer some semi-new material. The live versions of Rhiannon and Landslide are absolutely gorgeous, and her live cover of Rock And Roll is SICK. (In a good way.) And I like that the Deep Dish remix of Dreams is on here, as I thought it was a great reinvention of a classic.    But the best \\"new\\" track on here is the live version of Edge Of Seventeen that closes the disc. (And unlike Enchanted, which was missing the studio version in lieu of a live version, this CD also contains the amazing original studio version.) In fact, I'd go so far as to say it's actually BETTER than the studio version. A new powerful string arrangements amps up the drama of the song and makes it truly an event rather than just a great song. She's had a lot of amazing live versions in the past, including a mostly acoustic one for VH1 Storytellers, but this one trumps them all.    The DVD with this set is TRULY the reason fans should pick this set up. The DVD contains all 11 of her released music videos, an unreleased version of Stand Back that has been floating around the internet in terrible 15th generation VHS rips for years, and a live performance of Edge Of Seventeen from her White Winged DoveTour HBO broadcast. (Sadly, it's currently the only live solo Stevie we have on DVD outside of the awesomely bad Red Rocks DVD. Reprise seriously needs to release the uncut HBO special on DVD, including the songs not included in the broadcast or subsequent VHS and laserdisc releases.) If that wasn't enough, you can watch the videos with commentary by Stevie, where she discusses the songs, wardrobe, her hair, that awful treadmill in Stand Back, Mick Fleetwood's cameo in I Can't Wait, etc. And in addition, there's priceless home video footage of the making of the Bella Donna album. In all, you have up to two and a half hours of viewing pleasure if you count separate viewings of the videos with and without Stevie's commentary.    The CD/DVD package is a beautifully done digipak which opens up to three panels. The left panel holds the CD, the right panel holds the DVD, and the middle panel holds the CD booklet in a sleeve. The booklet and trays of the digipak include all kinds of gorgeous photos of Stevie, some never before seen. The discs themselves are adorned with artwork created by Stevie herself. The set's liner notes are also incredible and feature a short essay on her career by David Wild and Stevie's thoughts on almost every song. (Commentary on Rooms On Fire is oddly missing.)    It doesn't matter if you already own Enchanted and/or Timespace. You MUST own this set if you're a Stevie fan. The commentary on the videos and priceless behind the scenes footage alone is worth the price, but add the incredible new live tracks and remixes and the fact that this is the first best of CD she's released with Silver Springs in its original form? Absolutely a no-brainer.
B0013FDM7E|1.0|I was looking forward to this film but was very dissapointed. Slow going most of the time, rent if a fan of Will Smith.
B00005ASGG|5.0|One of the great westerns and one of Wayne's best. Lee Marvin is perfect as Liberty Valance. Come to think of it, Stewart's not bad either.   However,this is no shoot em up - it's a western with a message. Spoiler Warning! If you haven't seen the movie, read no more.    The man who, ostensibly, shot Liberty Valance, gets the girl and is elected to Congress to boot. The man who actually did shoot Liberty dies in obscurity.  Sometimes, life is like that.
0321544080|5.0|Inspiring!    Joe is one of my favorite photographers.In this book you are able to go into Joe's mindset when he shot the image. But not only that, but he shares with you what he learned as a photographer as well as a human being.    I love his philosophy on lighting and flash... he uses whatever light is available... be it flash or available light. Joe is very practical, down to earth and honest. Great Book!    It is formated into short two pages chapters, with charts, definition of terms, and the image itself. So it is an easy and enjoyable read,
0141439807|5.0|I ordered all the books at once and they came in in a very timely matter.  Not to mention the books were in excellent shape as if I just picked them up from Books a Million down the street.
B001152TL6|4.0|I am a big David Lynch fan, and this was worth waiting for. To David Lynch, if you are reading this please, please keep up the good work. There are many ways to explore art, and yours covers all the areas both on the surface and below, most other movies are shallow but yours pass from the surface into the inner contiousness with ease.
B00005JLT5|5.0|I told my wife and youngest daughter that they were going to love this movie as I had seen it once before.  I didn't know that it was going to have such a profound impact on my daugher who followed up the first viewing with several encores and ordered 3 books on-line to continue the \\"research\\" into this powerful story.  It's hard to believe that this really happened but is a story that we are all obligated to learn.  The entire movie is first rate...one of the best ever made!
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Vendor delivered the DVD on time and as ordered.  I would order from them again.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|The photography, character development, and music are awesome in this movie.  The entire production is a combination of ultra sensitive yet powerful performances.  This is my favorite blu-ray to date and nothing else has been really close.  A classic for years to come and a can't miss!
089381525X|5.0|The author: a great reporter.  The book: a detailed \\"story\\" of manual workers, from Sicily to Cuba and India...  Very good images, very well printed. Very very good black and white warm tone.
1576754499|5.0|Polak presents a very concrete approach to development especially on issue of bringing up poor people who are entrepreneurs in their daily struggle for life.  With the irrigation of one acre-farm techniques and  the slum people creativities, to the designers who can do simple tools well designed for the 90 percent instead of only the main 10 percent whom they are used to design for, Polak brings a new look and fresh understanding to how development experts and agencies need to start listening to local people.
0321334876|5.0|This book must be required reading for anyone developing in C++. I count this book as essential as Bjarne Stroustrup's \\"The C++ Programming Language\\"; these two books are a necessity.    Mr. Stroustrup's book could be considered a technical reference to the C++ language. This book I consider as a technical reference for how to use the C++ language.     The book was well written. I found the book to be easy to read and the index to be exhaustive enough for the book to be used as a quick reference.
0061438294|5.0|My whole life I've been told that I can read people better than anyone they know.  I can come to near immediate conclusions with people around me, and can determine the type of person they are.  That said, this book is an excellent start to reading people, and Joe Navarro covers the basic principle of body language very well.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who meets people on a day to day basis, such as Salespersons, and Managers.
0440234743|4.0|This book was a departure from the books I would normally buy. I am glad I took that detour. The book was hard to put down in that the story line and plot were extremely well developed and the book was very thought provoking.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Amazing! The best musical film of this age! The Beatles are realy universal reference of good music, and now the songs in the movie show us a new understanding of them! Fantastic!   I buy after have seen on the Movie and no regrets about the DVD. Good quality of images and sounds. Very interesting extras.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|An incredible documentary.  My wife and I were so impressed, last week we signed up to purchase Green Power from our electric company.  It only costs 3 cents per killo-watt-hour extra.  A great deal.
B0002BO05S|2.0|It appeared to me that this film had high expectations in the 60's especially with the lavish production, but there are obvious faults.  First, it appears it was filmed around Arizona and perhaps near the Colorodo River or possibly the Grand Canyon areas.  Acting is terribly weak and I could not push my belief beyond these faults to allow the film to move me.  With the spiritual theme such as this film portrays, the acting should have be somewhat distant of American dialect but it is  clearly too American.  One area that I will give some basic credit was the Crucifixion scene at the end.  These were filmed well, but again the acting was just mediocre.  The centurian who said \\"Surely this man was the son of God\\" was just so predictable and appeared to have read it from a cue card or was overdubbed badly.  There was no genuine portrayal above the actors abilities here even with these notable actors.  I think casting was thoughtless.<br /><br />  In comparison to this production, I much prefer \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" which itself was a made for TV miniseries film, but had much more emotional depth to the characters.  Also Christ is portrayed in such a close yet mystical quality.  Robert Powell ranks as one of the best in my view that trully stepped outside himself into the sublime.<br /><br />  There are other notable epic biblical themed productions.  I recommend Ben Hur with Charlton Heston, The Ten Commandments, Jesus of Nazareth & even the 70's production of Godspell.
0307394549|5.0|I love to cook and bake, but I am very particular about the cookbooks I buy.  I want a book that will be useful, with delicious recipes, and not just pretty to look at.  This book exceeded my expectations! I really like the table of contents - it is divided into categories of cookies, plus there is a picture of each cookie.  This is very helpful when you are trying to zero in on a specific texture, flavor, or look. I know this book will end up being one of my favorites, although Martha would be appalled if she knew there were typographical errors in it!
B00110K62U|5.0|Hadn't watched the VHS of this in a while, and forgot how much fun \\"Master of the House\\" was.  I think I actually first saw this on PBS.  I guess, though, if you are going to own one version of Miz, you may as well make it this one.  I personally found it jaw-droppingly good.  The bonus disc is wonderful as well.  I really don't get into musicals (I'm sort of a closet musical fan...certain ones capture me, others I could care less) per se, I mean, this is the only one I own on DVD and VHS (bought Cats on VHS to see what the hype was all about), but this is awesome.  Part of the reason I bought it, to be honest, is I had read the book (unabridged version) and loved the book.  I feel the musical captures the spirit of the book completely.  This a wonderful roller-coaster of emotions.  Live it, love it.  VIVE LES MISERABLES!!!
B00122M2QU|5.0|Nice to see the two brothers back together again. This CD is worth what I paid for, I'm 36 years old and tend to not care about modern metal. But this sort of music stands its ground. I bought the mp3 download and I'm not disappointed.     The songs are not really Soulfly versus Sepultura. You have to listen to this to really appreciate the songs.    Good going Max and Igor Cavelera!
B000WTSWTK|2.0|I enjoyed the concert and Christina's performance, but I though much of the concert was very poorly filmed and the spazmatic editing was very hard to take.  It made enjoying the concert very difficult.      The video framing was very poor with terrible zooming that made no sense.  The half-second camera angle changes compounded the issue as did the very poor editing.
1594200106|4.0|Having purchased this book on the advice of a friend who raved about it, I did not expect it to live up to her rather effusive praise.  After a few chapters, I was hooked by the language, the story, and the questions raised by the author.  I literally was riveted to the novel the last 100 pages and constantly surprised by the unconventional twists and turns that the story took that I had not expected.  The characters, with a few exceptions, are fully drawn and believable, even if somewhat surreal in some cases.  I hesitate to give too much away as you must read the book to appreciate its appeal.  I worried about the novel's being a translation, but once I started reading it, never gave that aspect another thought.  For a highly unusual and literary read, give this book a try!
B0013TUJLC|1.0|seriously why would anybody want the live version of CDs espeacially if its like there audio album. This was the same like there audio album but this is live with 2 more songs thats live, and the 2 more songs were not that great thats a waste of money. And they had the nerve to make this an album if you have the audio version of rock then that artist comes out with the live version with the songs that was on there audio album don't get it cause its a waste of money. So this was not a good its better in audio version.
0525950079|5.0|Ken Follett has written another masterpiece.  World Without End is rich in character and in story.  A fantastic read, one that I could not easily put down.  If you enjoyed The Pillars of the Earth, you won't be disappointed!
B0013FBS20|5.0|I love Blu-ray's they are buy far the best out there, and this movie looks amazing in HD.
B00008977N|5.0|Peter Gabriel takes you on a visual journey of discovery, one of the great luminaries of rock. Peter Gabriel and his international collection of great musicians are at the top of their abilities. Gabriel leads us through a mystical trek of spiritual beauty. Allow yourself to float along and you will not soon forget the experience.<br /><br />There are few DVDs that capture the feeling of actually being at a live rock concert, but that is exactly what director Francois Girard has achieved. I have seen Gabriel live quite a few times all the way back to his days with Genesis (saw \\"Lamb Lies Down\\" tour in '75). He will astound you and this is the best, most complete show, beginning to end, he ever did.
0307237702|5.0|I recommend both of Barack Obama's books; very well written, a good mix of history,current events, philosophy,humor and honesty. A must read for anyone that wants to really know our nominee for president. He is truly inspirational and a man for out times.

B00005A46T|5.0|Really what's nu metal about it only a couple of scratches and that's it.Man this album made many nu metal fans dissapointed cause really is just a \\"heavy brutal\\" album.If you want something heaviesh get this,is slipknot's best album ever the heaviest they have done and who know's how \\"heavy\\" their new album will be.Iowa is the heaviset so far better than vol 3 it has trash and some death metal going on but still not there.Trust me when you hear this it won't sound NU metal it's just a great heavy album that would make you wish slipknot sounded more like this.If someone told me if i think slipknot is brutal i would just tell them yeah in their album iowa it's heavy yeah!

B0014Z4OQG|1.0|\\"Blair Witch\\" meets \\"Godzilla\\" with a small dose of \\"Starship Troopers\\" thrown in.  I liked the last two, and sci-fi in general, but this was weak.

B000WT7R6O|5.0|Supernatural is one of the best TV shows I've ever seen. My husband and I are both shamelessly HOOKED! There's plenty of action for the guys, and plenty of eye-candy for the gals! The show has awesome music - classic rock for those into the 70s and 80s stuff. AC/DC, Metallica, and one episode has a hilarious REO Speedwagon moment! The show's writers, producers, director all must be geniuses, too - they have so many quirky little jokes embedded. We love to see what they come up with next! Like, when Linda Blair guest starred - there were a couple lines at the end about her looking familiar and craving pea soup. And when they visited a movie set in Hollywood Babylon, there was a reference to Stars Hollow & Gilmore Girls. HYSTERICAL! Even if you think you don't like \\"creepy\\" stuff like ghosts and ghouls, you should check out this show. I hated \\"creepy\\" shows till I saw this one. It rocks!! Thanks to the guy who created it and to everyone who keeps it going strong!

B0013ANMWY|4.0|I Loved this one! I usually do not like Sci-Fi for aliens just isn't my favorite thing to watch. But this one, well it was really good. Nichole's character was everything you would expect it to be. Classy, Beautiful, and as a mom she had the right feelings, protectiveness. An Ex well I believed it, and the boyfriend they had chemistry. The movie started with creepiness that is made for a good thriller but just not sure what to expect and left you filling in some of the blanks which gets an A for letting us use our imagination. The plot is a takeover used in form of a virus which fits in the 21st century. At least when people started to change it didn't make you have to believe aliens as little green creatures (even though there was green soup :)). To live you have to act like one of them, which to me wouldn't be that easy. But all in all this movie was to me a solid thrill ride with a touch of horror, and worth seeing again.
0307346609|5.0|This is my favorite zombie novel of all time although the book starts off a little slow.  I love all of the short stories from people all over the globe and the slow build up of the zombie invasion and how people try and escape it.  It's well thought out and the character development was amazing for how short some of the stories were.  Some of the military stories got a bit too into depth with the weapons they used and the termology of zombies, but other than that I loved it!
B000001EEN|4.0|I an a huge Clapton fan, who had this album in the 70's. Needless to say I misplaced it somewhere along the line, I was so happy to purchase this CD it is better than I remember, one of my favorite CD of all time. Everyone needs to own this CD.
0525950079|4.0|I really liked this book even though some people claimed there was too much sex and that the dialogue was incorrect for the time period.  I tried not to get caught up in this because it didn't detract from the storytelling at all and the character development was still excellent in my mind and all the characters were multi-dimensional believable characters.  As for the dialogue being incorrect for the period, I believe that's a moot point because most readers wouldn't have been able to understand what the characters were saying so I think its a nice balance of history and storytelling at its best.
B000UD0ESA|1.0|I've seen all the versions of this film and, for some reason, really want to like it.  Unfortunately, most of the movie takes place in dark rooms, intended to symbolize, perhaps, a dark future but serves only to underscore the unreality of the film.  Any real person going into any of the rooms in this film would open the drapes or turn on a light.  It is like the technical director is about 14 years old.<br /><br />And it is slow, possibly so that we don't miss the product placement.<br /><br />I know this is supposed to be noirish, but noir films always clip right along.  This drones along with a David Lynch obscurity (again, think 14 year old).  I think if I were stoned as I watched it I might think it was deep.  But, unfortunately, I wasn't, so I just wish they'd turn the lights on.
0679735909|5.0|Possession is one of the more remarkable novels I have read. Byatt not only creates two very human and believable Victorian Era poets but stunning and original work for each as well. While the book can be challenging(there is a lot of poetry that is far from simple) it is an enthralling read. The characters feel genuine and real and the tenative romance between Roland and Maud is wonderfully and tenderly done. Byatt even manages to find and ending of both simple beauty and one that is also emotionally satisfying.

B000W9DTG6|2.0|Ocean's Eleven was scratched and did not play well.  There was a hand written note stating this attached to the inside of the trilogy box, but it was not mentioned on the sales screen.

0061142700|5.0|Goodnight Moon was a part of my prekindergarten class and is now a part of my 9 month old son's bedtime routine.  The CD includes a reading of the story and, in my opinion the best part, the story sung as a lullaby.  The lullaby is soft, calm and beautiful with guitar adding to the soothing sound.  As a teacher, I used this song to transition to our quiet time and as a mother I play this lullaby while feeding my son his oatmeal bedtime snack.  We then say good night to several items in his room before going to sleep.  The CD is not over the top or cooky, like many children's songs.  It is simply a beautiful lyrical version of one of the best bedtime stories.
0670018651|1.0|The trouble with this book is that it's like two high school girls sitting around mocking everyone. Nastiness abounds and while it is amusing for the first few pages it got on my nerves after a chapter. On top of that the reveiews aren't very good. The authors dislike a particular celebtity and give a devastating descriptiton of her perfume based not on the scent, which is actually nice though weak but on the horridness of the woman herself. That has nothing to do with perfume.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|This one has it all -- a taut political thriller with the best actors in the business.  Not only do you get Bill Nighy (think of his performance in \\"Love Actually), John Simm, Philip Glenister (the sparring police rivals from \\"Life on Mars\\") and other sure-fire crowd pleasers, but Marc Warren's performance alone is worth the price of admission!  Kudos to Paul Abbott (writer) and David Yates (director).  Drama doesn't get any better than this!
B000VWE5OY|5.0|Torchwood is the best show on television right now.  It's great sci-fi, but more than that, it's all about relationships and of course, sex.  The entire team is interesting, and it's the interplay between the team members that makes the show.  Torchwood series 1 is interesting and sets things up.  The last couple of disks in the set are the best.  Torchwood series 2 is even better, but you need to watch series 1 to understand series 2.  I also recommend buying Doctor Who series 1 and 3 to get the full picture.

0345451325|5.0|I had reservations about reading this book. Was this truly a good book to read or was all the great reviews on this site just fluff from Halo fans?  Would reading this take the mystique away from the legendary Master Chief?<br /><br />I just finished reading the e-book format on my Palm Z22 PDA and all I can say is WOW! WOW! WOW! This story blew me away!<br /><br />Not only was this a fantastic book to read, it was incredibly well done and Master Chief is as legendary as ever. I was pleased to be able to put a human face on Master Chief in my imagination and know that it did not spoil who MC is or what he's all about - it only made him more respectable. I am in as much awe of John 117 (aka Master Chief) out of armor just as much as he is in armor. Kudos to the author for pulling this off in this very well written book.<br /><br />I'm ready for the next book in the series!

B00005JPTK|2.0|Give director Francis Lawrence this much credit for his work in \\"I Am Legend:\\" He knew how to stick a sword in its belly. The movie is all kinds of ridiculous - in part because it holds its cards practically *inside* the vest for the opening act - and Lawrence, instead of succumbing to hubris and letting it drag on for a craptacular two-and-a-half hours (like most blockbusters these days) he ends it, mercifully, at 90 minutes. Yeah, maybe it's because the zombies look like Bat Boy from the Weekly World News, but still - brevity is a virtue.     Stripped of all the subplots that made Richard Matheson's source novel so compelling (and the inspiration for some good films, comics, and books since its printing in the 1950s), \\"I Am Legend\\" is a vaguely intriguing \\"Cast Away\\" vehicle for Will Smith until it must deliver some action goods, which is does efficiently and without any particular rules or sense whatsoever, before closing on a old fashioned Blow Up Real Good sequence. This explosion, really, is the perfect ending for the film Lawrence actually made. Some moviegoers - who have invested far too much thought in this lame experience - prefer the \\"alternate ending.\\" Not I, for reasons that simply don't matter.    Smith is Dr. Robert Neville, the last \\"survivor\\" in New York City of a cancer vaccine gone viral. Most New Yorkers died upon contracting the illness; others mutated into rubber-faced, physically amazing zombies that hate the sunlight, even though, unlike the spiritually touched vampire, they're simply mutations, which means they'd need sunlight to...oh, never mind. If you want to believe the sun could crash into a black hole and these creatures could survive, go ahead. Screenwriter Akiva Goldsman provides all of this with a somber sincerity that informs the movie's look and tone in the first half-hour; Neville and his German shepherd stalk the streets of an overgrown NYC in near silence, as Lawrence keeps the soundtrack music to a minimum. Like \\"Cast Away,\\" it's compelling to hear the sounds of the world in this film. Unlike \\"Cast Away,\\" it also seems like a way to blow 30 minutes without having to show those ridiculous zombies.    So Neville's still after a cure for the mutation, and he carefully orchestrates traps so he can capture \\"subjects\\" for tests; despite the end of civilization, all of the utilities still work and the gas pumps aren't dry, so Neville uses a giant, state-of-the-art lab for his work. The zombies seem to be getting smarter, though, plotting their own revenge on the \\"hunter.\\" Sandwiched in there are some flashbacks of NYC's last night as a living (and implausibly civilized) city and the fate of Neville's wife and daughter. These are effective enough, but they're also cheat, really - the movie doesn't want to give Neville the same struggle he has in the novel.    It's right about then that Lawrence gets his hustle on; Goldsman shuttles a couple more survivors onscreen so the title can make the least bit of sense, but Neville doesn't want much to do with them. There's a raid, a showdown, and a big boom. Or, if you prefer, the alternate love-in. Blammo. Over.
0790730960|5.0|Between the critical and commercial success of \\"Batman Begins\\" and the failure of \\"Batman and Robin\\", it is easy to forget this earlier outing in the Batman series, which is a shame since, in my opinion, it is the best of the whole lot. This installment pits Batman (Michael Keaton) against the Penguin (Danny DeVito) and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer). It combines the style of the \\"Batman\\" comics and the far-fetched fun of the 1960's TV series, with the dark vision of (director) Tim Burton and the black humour of (writer) Daniel Waters (who also wrote \\"Heathers\\"), with the result being a film that is both well made and thoroughly enjoyable.     Interestingly, Batman seems to have considerably less screen-time than the two villains, in this film, demonstrating that Burton and Waters understood exactly why people are drawn to \\"Batman\\". It's not the guy in the bat-suit, but the larger-than-life villains, and the villains in this film are two of the best. Sure, the idea of a man raised in the sewers by penguins and a woman saved from a multi-story fall by cats are ridiculous, but hey, if you're looking for realism, you're watching the wrong film. The only problem I had with this film was the Catwoman costume. There is no way on earth that anyone could make a cat-suit out of that coat. Other than that, though, this is a great film and one that gets better with each viewing.

B0000009SY|4.0|I'm on my 2nd copy of this album, so you already know where I stand.<br /><br />If this album is a \\"hack job\\", as some of the negative critics here on this site suggest, it's one of the most brilliant \\"hack jobs\\" ever conceived. Seriously, could any of these killjoys do any better? As far as I'm concerned, no one's even TRIED. It's that hard of an act to follow.<br /><br />Fan that I am, I'll admit Zappa's had his share of clunkers (\\"No Not Now\\", anyone?), but this monster of a concept album doesn't belong in that category. It's all here- the sympathetic protagonist, the much-deserved swipes at religious chicanery/hypocrisy, the ballsy humor and wordplay (of which Zappa was a master of), the twisted supporting \\"cast\\" (a gay bi-lingual vacuum cleaner?? A rapist record exec with a speech impediment??), the gentle pokes at the band Toto, the eerie prophecy of the whole thing (Zappa clearly saw the likes of the PMRC looming over the horizon), and the entertaining, absurd storyline all wrapped up in a sci-fi/school play/narc film vibe.<br /><br />I suppose the short version, for the neophyte,would go like this: Act I is the \\"party\\" record. Act II is when it gets weird. Act III will give you chills (with the exception of \\"A Little Green Rosetta\\", which is a silly and clumsy way to end the album. That's why I give it 4 stars instead of 5).<br /><br />And the music? C'mon, this is Frank Zappa we're talking about, you already KNOW it's nothing short of brilliant.<br /><br />Act I takes you on a whirlwind tour of funk, twisted pop, blues rock, jazz fusion, fake reggae, and mock rock opera bombast as only Zappa can deliver. Acts II and III aren't quite as varied, but they are no less startling to say the least.<br /><br />The insane rhythmic complexities and time signatures on \\"Keep It Greasy\\" alone will make your jaw drop.<br /><br />If Zappa's passionate soloing during Act III doesn't move you, then you have even less emotion than Sy Borg. I was startled to see all the reviewers on this site praise \\"A Watermelon In Easter Hay\\". And here I thought I was the only sentimental fool who gets all lumpy in the throat every time I listen to that track.<br /><br />And \\"Packard Goose\\"- wow. Between the sophisticated (yet never cold) structure of the music and the damning lyrics, you can feel Frank's utter and total disgust for the music industry shine through like a beacon. Bitterness never sounded so righteously beautiful.<br /><br />So anyway....just buy the friggin' album, alright?
B000TX7B5U|3.0|I liked a lot of the stuff on the album, but it left me comparing it to System of a Down in a \\"middle-of-the-barrel\\" of their songs kinda way.    Overall, a decent album.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been getting back in shape for about 14 months now and am down 75 pounds (it can really be done by just eating better and exercising).  I am 5 pounds from my original goal and 15-20 from my ideal summer weight so I thought this might be a good way to get by that last little bit based on the stellar reviews.  I ordered this on Wednesday on super saver shipping and was so excited to get it today that I popped it straight in on level one.  I tell you this did not disappoint me at all.  I could barely make it through the first strength set but by the time I was ready to give up it was over and the next portion was starting.  It got me sweating and my muscles shaking but I loved every minute of it.  I had no problem following the instruction the first time through and personally found the cues better than most videos.  I plan on doing this every other day as a supplement to my regular cardio of 20-30 minutes a day and am very optimistic that it will knock those last few pounds right off.

B00065MDS6|4.0|In the hit-and-miss world of early 70s King Crimson, Lizard is a hit; unlike the unoriginal Poseidon and the pedestrian Islands, it's a surprisingly strong record by a band that never really managed to get its act together until 1973. Gordon Haskell's unconventional vocals are usually a prime target for ridicule, but they fit this album reall well. Haskell sounds much better than Boz Burrell and even Greg Lake's prog melodramatics grow old after a while. The cool thing about Lizard is that it's so damn strange -- there's no other King Crimson album that even tries to match its mutant mix of jazz, rock, and classical. The band even tries to tackle the super-cliche of progressive rock, a 20 minute epic suite with Jon Anderson of Yes on vocals, and manages to turn the cliches inside out. How many other prog epics have a Bolero section with dissonant multi-horn improvisation? Side one has four shorter pieces. \\"Happy Family\\" gets slammed a lot, but Gordon Haskell's manic, processed vocals, Pete Sinfield's obscure lyrics and the schizophrenic free jazz blowing make a great combination. One of Crimson's best tunes ever. Add that to \\"Cirkus\\", \\"Lady of the Dancing Water\\" (some beautiful flute on that one), and the Anglo-funk from Pluto of \\"Indoor Games\\", and you've got a great batch of music.    [This review is based on the 2000 reissue, which has perfectly good sound quality.]
0345494768|5.0|Fairy tales are usually about a young man who becomes a hero by battling the most dispicable enemies and achieving his heart's desire. In the end, despite great odds, monsters are vanquished, villainy is given the heave-ho, the princess' heart is won and great treasure is acquired far from the eyes of the Internal Revenue Service (which is how you can tell this is a fairy tale).<br /><br />\\"The Making of Star Wars\\" is just such a fairy tale, but it's not about the one up on the screen. This big, beefy, bouncy delight tells in 360 eye-squinting pages of type and hundreds of photos the story of how George Lucas, armed at first with nothing more than a bare bones script and a reputation for interesting, if not money-making movies, devoted more than four years of his life, bet his precarious career, and came up with a movie that not just redefined Hollywood blockbusters, but reimagined heroism and other virtues that touched a generation made cynical by the upheavals of the `60s and `70s.<br /><br />How he did it -- as described in this book -- should give all writers, artists and other dreamers pause to reflect on the value of preparation, hard work, a willingness to absorb ideas from others, and going into a project knowing that you have not only no idea how it will come out, but that bad luck will doom you no matter what you do.<br /><br />It's amazing that \\"Star Wars\\" was made at all, when it becomes clear in the book that the executives in charge at 20th Century Fox were more interested in busting Lucas' chops instead of making a movie. As one of Lucas friends notes: \\"There was a lack of respect for George. The movie industry is a very vituperative and petty industry most of the time -- and part of the negotiations was just to see how much they could push George around because they felt like they could.\\"After getting Lucas under contract cheap, before the success of \\"American Graffitti,\\" Fox proceeded to fritter away their leverage by withholding the contract for \\"Star Wars.\\" To keep the project going, Lucas was forced to invest his own money, and in the end, had to threaten to stop filming to get the contract. By that time, the project was so far along that Fox was faced with either agreeing to his demands, or letting the project go to another studio. Hence, was born the most lopsided contract in history, giving Lucas say over final cut, plus control over all sequels and merchandizing.<br /><br />Considering that \\"The Making of Star Wars\\" was published nearly 30 years after the movie's stunning debut, going back and putting together this history is a major accomplishment. Fortunately, J.W. Rinzler had access to interviews conducted during the production of `Star Wars,\\" when people were in the midst of the work and uninfluenced by its future success. This fills the book with episodes and incidents of such detail that it's possible to fall into the pages and imagine yourself, back in the mid-'70s, where hair was blow-dried, collars and pants were wide, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter were atop the political pyramid -- reflect on that when you look at Obama/Clinton/McCain!<br /><br />For the two weeks, I was in film geek heaven, boring my wife at lunchtime with details about alternative casting (Christopher Walken as Luke! Jodie Foster as Leia!), alternative storylines (Luke was a girl at one point and named Starkiller; the robots were originally bureaucrats working for the Empire; Lucas toyed with filming it all in Japanese, with subtitles), sources for names (Han Solo? From a brand of paper cups) and those small incidents that acquire greater meaning (an out-of-work James Earl Jones spending a day in a studio to record Darth Vader's lines for $7,500). And don't get me started on the models and special effects; we'd be here all week.<br /><br />But the heart of the story is George Lucas, and while I've always respected the man, my heart went out to him once I understood the impossible odds he worked again. \\"Star Wars\\" was made because he willed it into being; he was the Jedi who rescued his movie.<br /><br />Lucas created a fairy tale for our times, but his story had a fairy tale twist as well. After laboring for years, fighting the studio executives and impossible deadlines, Lucas got his movie out. But he thought he had failed: \\"When I saw the first cut, my only opinion was that I did a terrible job, but it works. It doesn't work very well, but it works. ... And then when I finally saw it with an audience for the first time, I realized that no matter how far short I fell and how far short all the departments fell from what I wanted, the film did work for an audience. ... They all laughed at the right place and they believed it.\\"<br /><br />So the hero wins after all, but not in the way you'd expect. That's the hallmark of all good stories.o rescued his movie.

B0002NRQTI|3.0|Presto and Roll the Bones pared down the wall of synthesizers that Rush was known for in the 80s, but it wasn't until this album that the band finally reverted into the heavy power-trio style. Though the songwriting is in the same straightforward, accessible style of the previous two albums, Alex Lifeson supplies more loud, distortion-laden riffs than he had in years. The music itself is erratic -- it starts out great (\\"Animate\\", \\"Cut to the Chase\\", \\"Nobody's Hero\\"), descends to an unremarkable mush in the middle and then finishes strong on the last four songs. Fans of the band's early, metal days may really enjoy this back-to-the-basics Rush.    [This review is based on the 1993 original release, not the 2004 remaster.  I have no issues with the original's sound quality.]
1401216676|3.0|Before reviewing the content I must comment on the cheap, glue bound, binding of the book, which is not up to snuff. I've had my copy for less than 4 weeks and the binding is showing signs of coming apart; this is not acceptable for a hardcover, \\"Deluxe Edition.\\"    Brian Bolland has re-colored the book himself for this hardcover edition and the results are subtle but distinctly different from the original with mixed results.     First, he has toned everything down a bit with colors, that he intended, on a white page, as opposed to the more vibrant colors on the black page from the original. The re-coloring is subtle, but the older volume is more dynamic and I must say I really liked the black page the book was printed on in the original which gave the book the darker tone that garnered so much attention.    Second, the \\"Red Hood\\" flash backs are now in a sort of sepia tone with usually one or two objects prominently colored per panel. The effect works, but uh, this is an idea from Frank Miller's Sin City books and seems kind of gimmicky as a result. Compared to the original, I like the older flash backs which were in full color.    Lastly, the yellow oval target on Batman's chest has been removed and I really don't like it. I've always preferred the yellow oval and it just looks like something is missing now. I really don't like this change.    Some of Bolland's character sketches (which are awesome) are included here and this made the purchase worthy for me. The price is great for a hardcover edition, but take note of the quality issues in my review.
B0002NRQTS|4.0|After the orchestral sound of the previous two albums, the band goes for a more stripped-down, organic sound. The keyboards are still there but take a less prominent role and the power trio sound begins its gradual return to center stage. Alex Lifeson uses the acoustic more frequently and adopts a more assertive, riff-oriented style on the electric. Some of the songs aren't that great (\\"Superconductor\\", \\"War Paint\\", etc.) but they're outnumbered by quality material. \\"Show Don't Tell\\", \\"The Pass\\", \\"Hand Over Fist\\", and \\"Available Light\\" are outstanding; \\"Red Tide\\", \\"Presto\\", and \\"Anagram\\" are close behind. This transitional album may appeal to those who think Rush suffocated in synths during the 80s even though the music here is far mellower than the 70s albums. This overlooked album belongs in every Rush fan's collection.    [This review is based on the original CD version, not the 2004 remaster.  I have never had any issues with the original's sound quality.]
B000ZN8036|5.0|As Sam Graham writes in his \\"Into the Wild\\" review, \\"For the next two years he lives the life of a vagabond...and turning his back on everyone who tried to befriend him (including Catherine Keener and Brian Dierker as two kindly, middle-aged hippies and Hal Holbrook in a deeply affecting performance as an old widower who tries to take \\"Alex\\" under his wing)\\". I think that Graham's review is solid and right on target except for this comment. McCandless doesn't turn his back on the people that try to befriend him he helps them to deal with the loneliness that is overwhelming them and that keeps them from a forward progression in their lives.  He brings something back to them that they have lost and that they need to grasp once again. In his journey he helps these people as far as he can but then it is up to these \\"friends\\" to salvage from their own lives what he has taught them to retrieve or to rediscover. This really is one of the most important aspects of the film and I hope that this idea is what most people will take with them after watching it.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|\\"Cloverfield\\", directed by Matt Reeves and written by Drew Goddard.<br /><br />Modern day New York City: Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David) has just gotten the job of his dreams with the exception of his having to move to Japan to fill the position. Rob's Brother Jason (Mike Vogel) and his girlfriend Lily (Jessica Lucas) have decided to put on a surprise going away party for him including video testimonials from his guests. Jason is supposed to work the camera but he decides to put the job off on Hud (T.J. Miller), Rob's best friend. The party is jumping when all of a sudden there is a huge explosion in the middle of the city and all hell breaks loose. The party goers scatter leaving only Rob, Jason, Lily, Hud and Marlena together. Rob receives a call from his friend/girlfriend Beth, from across town saying she needs help...<br /><br />I was expecting a little more out of Cloverfield than was delivered. As stated in the title this felt exactly like \\"[[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]]\\" meets \\"[[ASIN:0767817478 Godzilla]]\\". The entire movie is shot with a hand held camera which can be a little nauseating at times.<br /><br />The Good: The concept of the movie was actually very good. Two ideas that had been done before were combined for a fresh take on each. The acting was decent all around. There are some really well played intense moments in the movie. The special effects were done well. They actually did a decent job of building the characters stories in short order.<br /><br />The Bad: I think there needed to be a little more interaction with the monster. I know it was shot to look authentic but I think some steady cam shots in the movie may not have been a bad addition and would have been a nice break from the headache inducing hand held.<br /><br />Overall: \\"Cloverfield\\" is a decent movie with some good intensity. If you couldn't watch \\"Blair Witch Project\\" because it made you nauseous doesn't bother with this one. If you can stand the Hand Cam, give \\"Cloverfield\\" a shot.

I had seen the film based on the book \\"Kite Runner\\" and thought that \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" by the same author would be an interesting book to read.  As it turned out, my friend had read \\"Kite Runner\\" and was delighted to receive \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" because he had already intended to buy it later on to read.

B000VWE5OY|5.0|'Torchwood' is a quirky British SciFi series about a special unit that tracks down otherworldly events and aliens. For the most part it's character driven and frequently dark but there are lovely moments of humor to balance the pathos. The characters are worth caring about as their personalities evolve over time from cold individualists to a supportive team of specialists. Unlike most British programs that cross the big pond, the characters have easily understandable accents and the occasional references to politics and cultural differences do not detract from the plot lines. The actors are accomplished and likable and the scripts are well written and engrossing.
B00005JPKE|2.0|What a disappointment. Gosh, I had heard so much about this movie and had somehow drawn the conclusion that life itself would be enhanced after viewing it. However, the film did little for me at all. I thought it a great bore, highly sentimental, strangely unrealistic, anti-Japanese and anti-American. In the first place, the film emphasizes the Japanese concept of honor but then shows the officers acting with shameless dishonor. The General, who is depicted as a solid guy, can't find anyone willing to obey his orders. The officers are so eager to commit suicide, it is a wonder they waited for the American to attack. Virtually every command made by an officer to an enlisted man is greeted with, \\"yeah, but...\\" instead of \\"yes, sir.\\" It is chaos down in those tunnels. One group is going one way, while another is going another. The General's orders never get delivered, and anyone who wants to fight is killed for disobeying the order to commit suicide. I don't believe anything like this took place. The one American captured is fed and treated with precious medicines, but the one Japanese captured by the Americans is shot on the spot, white flag in hand. The fat, smoking soldier who shoots him point blank can't be bothered to guard him. The Japanese come off as the keystone cops, while the Americans, presumably led by Darth Vader, are well-fed, heartless slobs. More Japanese are killed by each other than by the enemy. When they are not swinging their swords at each other, they are aiming their pistols. There are three guys in particular whose job it is to kill as many of their fellow soldiers as possible, for fear they might say something against the Emperor, or fail to kill themselves at the first sight of the enemy. These loud-mouths are extremely obnoxious. I am not sure what Clint Eastwood wanted to achieve by making this \\"culturally sensitive\\" nonsense, but I am now persuaded that his aims have nothing to do with art and everything to do with propaganda. Was this supposed to make me see that the Japanese are human too? \\"Can't we just get along?\\" Well, I for one am all in favor of getting along, but it is hard to stand by in silence while watching one country destroy another. I'd advise Mr. Eastwood to read the history of the Japanese in Asia, beginning with Korea.
1400034779|4.0|What a delightful look at life in Botswana.  after finding the seventh in the series at the airport, i just had to know how it all started.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|From a Marketing aspect Cloverfield was a huge success.  It cost 25 mil to make it and on opening weekend it grossed 40 mil domestically, which broke the record for a January release.  It dropped strongly after that and went on to gross 80mil in the U.S.    The film is all about Rob, as one reviewer on here mentioned (Puzzle Box), Rob  could've been taken from the cast of the real world.  We see more of Rob in the film then we do of the huge cool monster that decapitates the statue of liberty.  At the beginning we see Rob with a hot girl, but, oh dear, now at his going away party a month later she shows up with another guy.  They have a little falling out and the hot girl and her guy Travis leave, while Rob's last words are good luck tonight Travis.  Rob's brother, his brother's girlfriend, and his best friend (who holds the camera) try to cheer him up, because even though all these people came to his party he is going to sulk in a corner and then go into his bedroom, this becomes a theme.    All of a sudden Manhattan is attacked by the big cool monster mentioned above, and you guessed it Rob just can't let those be the last words he said to the hot girl.  In a nut shell it goes like this:  Dude, I like have to get to her dude.  Everyone feels so much pity for the little drama going on nobody seems to help anyone around them that could have glass in their grills.  SPOILER ALERT.  Rob's brother dies, he kind of looks upset for a second but quickly focuses on the hot girl again. To console his brothers girl he says at least you didn't say good luck tonight Travis to him.  Oh, there is another hot girl that gets bitten by something, Rob doesn't want to let her finish a soda because he's got to get to this girl he hooked up with once, soon her eyes start bleeding and she has to be killed by the military.  Rob's best friend is upset cause he wanted to hit it but Rob basically tells them, um dudes we gotta go to my girl, so they go and feel sorry for him along the way, not thinking at all about their parents or the big picture.      The best friend delivers corny one liners seconds after family members deaths and right after the hot girl he's trying to have sex with just got half eaten by a thing spawned from the beast.  That's basically it, oh, and the girl he's gotten everyone killed trying to get too (even though there was a single file line out of the city by the military) was with another guy cause he didn't call her for months after they hooked up.    The acting was actually good, but, was about a self absorbed, selfish guy who likes to say dude.  The monster and the mayhem were also cool.  If the movie didn't try to be so serious and went a 50s monster movie throw back with a real feel, then ok.  Or, if you want to make it serious give people that are somewhat likable, which can be done with little or no words, less words would have worked better.      Instead of Cloverfield or what should have been called Rob and it's hour and 15min run time I'd suggest another recent release, the black and white version of [[ASIN:B0010X73ZG The Mist (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]].  It's wrapped in a 50's and 60's style monster movie along the lines of [[ASIN:B00005Y6Y2 Night of the Living Dead (Millennium Edition)]], and is filled with metaphors for much deeper issues and characters you care about.
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|If you love period epics, fantastic costumes, and each frame a visual beauty. Oh yes, and a really good story pulled from history. Than you will enjoy this film! The acting is top drawer, Kate is fantastic as as this amazing woman who was Queen Elizabeth! Enjoy!  (My only regret is they have not, released this on Blu-Ray!)
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Unlike most reviewers, I didn't care much for the hit \\"Love Song\\" - sounded too much like \\"cater to the Billboards\\" pop.  But one day, browsing Hastings, I heard the CD playing over the store speakers, and halfway through the CD I was hunting down an empoyee to tell me what they were playing.  Every so often, a CD will be born that I know will stick with me forever, and this is one of those. Fantastic, smart, sometimes beautiful, sometimes critical, but track for track a masterpeice.    The music is catchy and varied, the lyrics are poetic and honest, the voice is beautiful and catchy.  And she can sing!    Later, I read the story behind \\"Love Song\\", and now I even like that one (hint: it has everything to do with \\"cater to the Billboards\\" pop - but NOT in the way that you'd think!).  I won't bother to compare Sara Bareilles to another performer - it wouldn't be relevant.  Buy it!
B000WS4PCO|5.0|To say that this was probably a red-letter day in the history of music ... is an understatement.<br /><br />When this first album came out, I missed it completely.

I was young once and couldn't possibly be that hip to catch everything on the early adoption tip. I view this album probably as important as Beethoven's [[ASIN:B000050GK3 Missa Solemnis]], as that may be what they were going for, or Vivaldi's [[ASIN:B000065SXI Stabat Mater]].

I know that may sound deviant to you, but it's very simply explained.<br /><br />The bulk of the songs on this album are ballads. You may not want to hear that, but it's the truth. Some may just be realizing this for the first time, and it's okay, too. While I have no problem with ballads, being big fan of Beethoven and Chopin, masters of just such a thing, I wouldn't dare call Moonlight Sonata (Sonata Quasi una Fantasia) Rock Music at any time. Ballads are just that, they're ballads. They're beautiful and they typically speak on the subject of love, loss, frustration or isolation. That's not a rigid rule, but just a personal observation.<br /><br />1. 'Where the Streets have no name' - Ballad. A song about feelings of isolation and love.<br />2. 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For' - Ballad. Another song about the feelings concerning isolation, loss and love.<br />3. 'With or Without You' - Ballad.

While this isn't necessarily an indictment on this album it's just an opinion placed casting light on seeing this album in the proper context. U2 has been branded passion rock since this album came out, and it's probably fitting to say the least, but they are one of the best RnR bands on the planet. People should just see this release for what it is.

B000001E18|5.0|I'll be the first to say that U2 did experiment here, and this is very different from records like, say 'The Joshua Tree' or 'The Unforgettable Fire.' But hey, it's still a great U2 record.     Many fans of 1980s U2 disliked this record, and I never (and still to this day) don't understand why. It's got great songs. 'Numb' features The Edge on vocals, with Bono and his great high falsetto singing background vocals, and a good quiet song in 'The First Time.'    The intro to 'Zooropa' is great. It features great piano parts from The Edge, as well as some experimental synthesizer sounds.     The legendary country music hero Johnny Cash stops by to sing lead on 'The Wanderer,' a great classic country music song that's well worth checking out if you're a Johnny Cash and/or U2 completist.    Overall, it's a great record that should not be condemned. It's a masterpiece. A great addition to anyone's U2 collection.    Highly recommended. ENJOY!!!

B0014CQNTK|1.0|I grabbed a copy of this movie after hearing so much about it. \\"Wonderful\\" and \\"funny\\" and \\"amazing\\" were some of the adjectives used. Somehow it turned out to be \\"boring\\" and \\"over-hyped\\" and, frankly, a waste of my time.    The plot is simple: teen gets pregnant, arranges to have baby adopted. The problem? Everyone is so hip and cool with the entire thing that the movie ends up with no drama, no comedy, and seriously no point. Juno's already a fringe member of her high school, so there's no change in her status there. The friend/father is still her friend, the best friend is still her friend, Juno's family is already non-traditional, and again, so hip with the happenings that nothing actually occurs. The couple that's going to adopt the baby is painfully yuppie, and clueless, and ends up split up, but the wife (whose name I can't even remember) still takes the baby. I guess that's the most interesting point of the entire film.    Mostly, it's two hours of my life I could have spent doing something else. Anything else. Don't bother with this movie. I wish I hadn't.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|As Patton was to George C. Scott, John Adams is to Paul Giamatti. It is not necessary to gauge this series according to its historical accuracy or whether events addressed are the most central (or relevant) to Adams' lifetime. Giamatti owns this character in a way that few actors acheive in their careers. The intensity of this performance, both in its vulnerablility and tenaciousness, paints a unique portrait of a man that is occasionally referenced in history books but not truly humanized in the way Jefferson or Washington has been. True I would like to have seen another 20 or so hours of this series - the briefness of certain stages of the man's life cannot be overstated - but how lucky we are to have seen such a powerful and memorable performance at all. Giamatti has so much to be proud of in this series, as does his wonderful co-star Laura Linney, who, as Abigail Adams, balanced and tempered the thinking of one of our most seminal founding-fathers. Enjoy the richness and humor of a series that will be discussed for years to come.

B0009X766Y|5.0|I bought the \\"Legacy Series\\" disc to get a wide screen version, and it is a very fine upgrade from my older 4:3 aspect version.    I can't comment on the additional content of the second disc.  I generally don't even watch that stuff.
B0000072KY|4.0|This was a very good album, and definetly more personal than Nevermind.  It definetly has a rougher, more abrasive and dense sound that will turn some listeners off, and others waaay on! Kurt touches on topics such as the record industry, drug abuse, loss, parental alienation, and his relationship with Courtney Love. Of course, there's the straight riffs with signature nonsense lyrics thrown in. While the album is great, it isn't as catchy and doesn't have the same replay value as Nevermind, probably because the music itself just doesn't sound as varied and pop-oriented. Nonetheless, this is definetly an album to have, and is a landmark piece of the 1990s. Buy it and love it
B0010X745K|1.0|This horror film is straight from the fog. However it is well done and the acting is believable. Mrs. Carmody shows how shallow the average intelligence of the modern human is as she not only goes insane but takes most of the others with her.      The ending ruins a good scrip, do writers really get paid for such boners? I recommend skipping the last five minutes or so and you will have a good movie.
B000TGCR4C|3.0|If you like seeing beautiful young women completely naked, and posed in compromising and perverse scenarios, then \\"Black Book\\" is for you.<br /><br />Carice van Houten as Rachel / Ellis, a Jew who falls in love with a Gestapo chief, is fully exposed onscreen, and things are done to her body that I've not only not seen in movies before, I didn't think I'd ever see.<br /><br />The sex only lets up in order to make way for graphic violence: a graphic scene of torture by water boarding, death by firing squad, and suffocation in a coffin whose lid is slowly screwed shut.<br /><br />Director Paul Verhoeven was criticized for depicting a Jewish woman as the lover of a Gestapo chief, and for depicting the Dutch Resistance as less than uniformly heroic in its resistance. I expected to be shocked by these features, but I was not. I just felt bludgeoned into numbness by all the nudity and bloodletting.<br /><br />I watched this movie on DVD, and after a while I just fast forwarded or closed my eyes through scenes I simply didn't want to watch: a woman exposing Ellis' body to the very Nazi who had murdered her parents, Ellis being drenched in bodily waste, yet another pile of corpses.<br /><br />The production values are very high. The movie looks fantastic. If you are into sex, violence, and sensation, this is the movie for you.<br /><br />I've read a lot of memoirs of the Nazi era, and met survivors. The Nazi era was not fun and games. I find watching movies about those days to be hard. When I do watch them, I want to feel that I've learned something, or felt something, that made watching the movie worthwhile.<br /><br />I didn't learn anything about the WW II era while watching this movie, although I did learn something about exploitation. I was unmoved. Carice van Houten is lovely, but she plays her role as a tough cookie. Given that she is a sex toy in the film, I found it hard to relate to her humanity.<br /><br />In the end, when Ellis / Rachel finally breaks down and begins to cry, one of her co-stars morphs into an eyebrow arching, mustache twirling parody of a Hitchcock villain, and tries to murder her by injection. That scene was so desperate for shock value I lost all faith in the film at that point.<br /><br />Sebastian Koch, who played Ludwig Muntze, the kind and sensitive Gestapo chief with whom Rachel falls in love, left me completely unmoved.

B001041JLE|5.0|Anyone lucky enough to have been young when this CD came out will forever feel its impact. Nothing even resembling this type music and dancing has ever been done this way before or since. I can not imagine who could do anything like MJ did. He was the best in his prime and I am grateful I was alive to have experienced the mood. I wonder how 21 year olds of today accept this music? In the 80's this was top shelf for dance clubs. People ate it up in giant clubs back then. Soon after this music came Freestyle and the club scene got even hotter. Thinking back,, I owned this as a vinyl record and then a cassette,lol, and now this new type.<br />Enjoy this Special CD/DVD.
055358894X|5.0|Wow. It has been years since a book grabbed me this hard. It reminded me of my misspent youth reading Fahferd and the Grey Mouser.<br />  I run a D&D \\"Thieves\\" campaign in a large fantasy city I created. After reading this book I wanted to junk all my hundreds of hours of work and steal this city! I am going to force all my players to read this book so they can see what REAL thieves do!<br />  Imagine a city built on the ruins of an enigmatic lost and forgotten race who built with unbreakable glass. This is a decaying metropolis with canals between its various sectors and alchemical trees floating in them to clean out the filth. Picture festivals with highly trained female gladiators who battle jumping sharks on an arena of open water with posts for them to leap about upon.<br />  Locke is an amazing character; clever, non-descript, a master of disguise, at once capable of horrific crimes and amazing compassion.<br /><br />  The dialogue had me laughing out loud more than once. Every character in it seemed to trigger some emotion with me, whether it was great affection or extreme hate. There are few boring people in this city!<br /><br />Read it you won't be sorry!
B00006BTCA|5.0|While my first experience with Interpol was their second album \\"Antics\\", I actually prefer the slightly less calculated and ethereal sound of Turn on the Bright lights. It sounds layered and rich, and bass heavy, which I love. It's one of those albums that you don't have to skip tracks when listening to. There are no fillers, and every song has a hook of some kind that keeps it interesting. Obstacle 1 is my favorite track, thanks to it's tempo changes and overall experimental sound. I think they're a great representation of their genre and style, and this is coming from a person who listens to Tool and Rage against the Machine. It's a must buy, enjoy it.
B0010V4TZU|4.0|I wish I would have heard of Vampire Weekend when they were first starting to make some underground waves. Despite that, they have a fun sound that will appeal to a lot of people (perhaps selling out from what they started off as, but can't tell for sure) from indie, alternative, and pop. It'll be interesting to see what happens next for them.
B0013FBS20|4.0|Plain and simple, overall good movie but let down of an ending, probably due to all the hype before viewing of the movie...but still enjoyable...
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|I was one of those people that stayed away from Kelly Clarkson because she *just* an American Idol. Kelly, I apologize. This cd kicks major @$$. Great lyrics - extremely personal but I think that's why so many people can relate, tight sound, edgy, everything I was looking for when I bought this cd.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This series has earned the top spot in my house. Each episode contains interesting sub-plots as well as being able to continue on the longer story arch of our favorite serial killer. Dexter, we learn, was taught to channel his insatiable urge to kill towards those who deserve it most. His adoptive father recognized his \\"illness\\" early on and so set forth to instill a set of values that only a sociopath could implement. No suspension of disbelief is needed here - just riveting stories with extremely professional acting, production, and writing. We anxiously await for season 2 to be released on DVD.
B00005JMYI|5.0|I found myself quoting the movie so often that I needed a copy to keep it fresh. Stay classy Amazon readers ~
B0013D8LOU|5.0|The movie the actors the scenes the music the costumes the story.......everything was perfect! The extra bonus material was icing on the cake. I loved every moment. It was Depp and Burton and Bonham Carter at their best!
0061547832|5.0|Very Strong & Encouraging read.  A step towards the business side of life...Very informative, promotes a strong attitude for setting new goals and acheiving them.
1400063515|5.0|This is an excellent analysis of the limitations and flaws in  our thought processes about reconstruction of the past and predictions of the future.Once you see them with the help of Taleb,you're better  prepared to understand the world of events that occur around us.  He even has suggestions as to how to reduce those limitations.  Not always an easy read but fascinating.....
B00132D808|5.0|I was introduced to PATD! only a year ago, and really enjoyed their previous album like most of us probably did. This album is NOT AFYCSO...not at all. Is that a good thing? I think so. They've dropped their ! and really created a musical masterpiece here.    I'd have to say it's less \\"rocking\\" then the previous, and much smoother. The whole album just fits together with a fast kickoff, and then settles into a funk/folk slowly throughout the rest.    My favorite part is that they really gave each song an individual feel to it. One of my biggest problems with albums today is just to make a single, and then make everything else sound like a variation of it. No such worries here.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|Finally an album worthy of one of the most important American groups.  We grew up with these guys, and for a while it looked like we parted ways...not so.  The boys from Athens have returned to the music that made us love them in the first place.  This album is quick, precise.  All the things that make REM are here.
0143038419|4.0|I enjoyed ELP as a fun page-turner book. I've heard criticisms of egotism: \\"She's not the only one to experience depression after divorce.\\" \\"She's not the first one to find inner peace and god through meditation.\\" I don't think she claims to be the first or only anything. She's a great writer with a keen sense of humor. I don't seek to follow her path, nor do I think she's full of sheesh. I just enjoyed the read.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Watching this movie was big waste of time.  The camera was the biggest problem. All I saw was the camera moving and shaking all over the place.  Plus, you didn't get a chance to actually see what was going on, with the guy holding the camera constantly moving. I was waiting for him to either drop the camera or get killed by the monster. When was real movie going to start?  The person who directed this movie was a fool, because he should have ended the camera at the party.  So Don't buy the DVD or go to the movies, because it STINKS!!!!! and a big waste of TIME!!! and $$$$.      Arberdella
B00005ASHM|1.0|Pet Sounds is a great album musically, but the sound on this particular version is so bad it's like taking an icepick to the ear (the Capitol version 'The Complete Album in Stereo & Mono 72435-26266-2-5): shrill and bright in the upper midrange, edgy, and just plain annoying. It's hard to believe Capitol let this thing out the door this way.  Doesn't anyone at Capitol listen to these things before they're released? Instead look for the superb DCC version of Pet Sounds (GZS-1035) mastered by Steve Hoffman in 1993, which sounds wonderful and does service to this great music.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|yes this is an awesome set but i this is the same thing as a buying all the 7 seasons sepretly. And if you think of it the price here is better than anywhere else. and if you by them sepretly you save money and yo0u get the same glory!!!  I LOVE GILMORE GIRLS!!!!!!!!
B00006EXCC|2.0|This remastered album has lost much of the edge of the original. A classic that has been rendered ordinary
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album feels like a non-stop club music event! Which is pure genius what Madonna did with this album, making the tracks just tie-in after another making it one continuous non-stop musical journey. It's early 80's Madonna meets the future electronica Madonna!
0307388840|5.0|I really enjoy reading Ian Mcewan's books, but I didn't expect much from this one since both my mother and my friend had stopped reading it midway.  That was a few years ago.  When I saw that the movie came out I figured I better read it before seeing the film.  So I checked out this \\"mass market version.\\"  I usually steer away from these editions but I like the way the cover looks and feels.  Anyway, at no point during my read of this book did I want to take a break from it.  Quite a bit of time is spent setting up characters and background, but this only makes the events that follow all the more gripping and compelling.  I really cared about the characters and felt what they were going through as much as I have in any book I've read.  At times I even felt my body reacting to McEwan's highly descriptive writing.  Indeed, this is an intense and at times grisly read, but it's one that creates an enjoyable connection to the story that McEwan exploits to the fullest as he plays with expectations and draws out some points in the story while delivering plot development in shockingly brisk fashion at others.  He makes it easy to get sucked in.  I still haven't seen the movie, but the pleasure I got from the book was more than I expected from both.
B0011HOEY4|1.0|I love gangster movies.  I'm predisposed to liking the genre.  I had trouble sitting through this thing.  The acting, casting, character development and especially the writing was horrid.  I never accepted the premise, and was totally unconvinced by the plot. The \\"babe\\" of the movie was moderately attractive.  I believed the love-at-first-sight \\"thunderbolt\\" that struck Michael Corleone in \\"The Godfather\\", but the meaningful stares from across the room in American Gangster were more like one of those wind-up joke hand buzzers.<br /><br />This is the worst Russell Crowe movie ever.  Am I the only person who thinks that Denzel Washington is a horrible actor?  Apparently so.  Did Ridley Scott get hit in the head with a cinder block and lose all of his talent.  Also apparently so.<br /><br />There's a scene where the Denzel Washington character throws a $50,000 chinchilla coat in a fireplace.  It's supposed to be a very dramatic moment, and Mrs. American Gangster gasps and cringes like some silent movie diva who just got an ice cube dropped down her dress.  She gave the chinch coat to Denzie, so she's all sorry about the fuss that was caused for her gangster hubby.  All I could think about how stinky that big mansion was going to smell after this fur pelt was burned.  I know how funky burning human hair smells, and I doubt if scorched animal hair smells any better.<br /><br />Mrs. American Gangster gave Mr. American Gangster a matching chinchilla hat that made the extraordinarily handsome Denzel Washington look kind of like he had a floppy velour mixing bowl on his head.  Ladies and gentlemen, we are talking dorky to the max.  One of the duties of any spouse is to say to their better half, \\"You aren't really going to wear that thing out of the house, are you?\\"  Mrs. A.G. seriously fell down in her duties really bad.  I mention this hat because Denzel did not burn the chinch hat with the chinch coat.  At least, I didn't see it hit the logs.  I didn't look at the \\"special features\\" for this movie, but was there more plot about the chinch hat?  Did the Denzel character keep the hat?  Did Mrs. A.G. come suddenly enter the master bedroom to find Mr. A.G. posing in his chinch hat in front of the mirror. Did Mr. A.G. then jerk the jauntily angled chinch hat from his head and hide it behind his back?  If, as they say in the movie, that the chinch coat is worth $50k, the hat, by volume, must be worth about, say $4166.66.  You don't just give that expensive an item to the Goodwill.  Or maybe, the Fur Coat Club For Gangsters had a special - \\"Buy A Chinch Coat And Get A Matching Chinch Hat For Free\\" sale.  (I can only speak for myself, but I would have worn the coat as a bathrobe, but not that hat.  I would, however, be willing to use the hat as a coaster for an ice bucket.)  So what happened to the hat?  Maybe Denzel Washington got to keep it for his scrapbook.  All of these gangsters have nicknames (e.g., Jimmy \\"The Weasel\\" Frattiano).  Did the American Gangster's buddies call him \\"The Chinch\\" or \\"Chilla\\" or \\"Furry Boy\\" after he wore that outfit? We may never know.<br /><br />I take it back.  I now like the movie but just for mystery of the missing hat.this movie, but was there more plot about the chinch hat?  Did the Denzel character keep the hat?

B000002UAX|5.0|Beginning with the release of Rubber Soul in 1965, The Beatles increasingly became recognized as major, \\"serious\\" artists whose best songs stood comparison with great classical music.  As their music became more ambitious, they drew progressively away from their rock and roll roots, becoming exclusively a studio band after August 1966, and then assuming the identities of fictional performers in Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967).  The pendulum turned the following year.  As suggested by its self-title, The Beatles (The White Album) was an effort by The Beatles to return to their origins.  In this quest, they faced great difficulties arising both outside and within themselves.     The first obstacle The Beatles confronted was that of history.  Between the time of their first stardom in the early 1960s and the making of The White Album in 1968, the world transformed.  The album was recorded during a time of political assassinations, Vietnam War casualties, and a sense of impending chaos.  At a fundamental level, the meaning of everything had changed.  In The Beatles' darker tone and loss of ebullience, one can sense how deeply affected they were as their musical home in rock and roll became a foreign place, \\"back in the U.S.S.R.\\"     In addition, the individual Beatles had by now drawn far apart musically.   John Lennon's shattering introspections (\\"Yer Blues,\\" \\"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\\") had little in common with Paul McCartney's bursts of pure melody (\\"Blackbird,\\" \\"I Will\\").  In songs such as \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" George Harrison emerged on The White Album as Lennon and McCartney's compositional equal, upsetting a balance in which his two bandmates had been the dominant songwriters.  Ringo Starr, too, moved to the forefront with the recording of his first song, \\"Don't Pass Me By.\\"  Although The Beatles were still an ensemble, the White Album became very much a collaboration of four solo artists.        Searching for their roots, The Beatles broke new ground.  The White Album's range is vast, with calypso (\\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\"), blues rock (\\"Yer Blues\\"), early heavy metal (\\"Helter-Skelter\\"), Indian-influenced rhythms (\\"Dear Prudence\\"), 1930s dance hall (\\"Honey Pie\\") and electronic sound collage (\\"Revolution 9\\") just a few of the forms represented.  Instrumentation varies from the sparse guitar and bird song accompaniment of \\"Blackbird\\" to the luxurious, full orchestration of the concluding lullaby, \\"Good Night.\\"   There are contrasting lyrics of distant love (\\"I Will\\") and uninhibited sex (\\"Why Don't We Do It in the Road\\"), of pastoral repose (\\"Mother Nature's Son\\") and insomnia (\\"I'm So Tired\\"), of forfeited time (\\"Long, Long, Long\\") and  birthday celebration (\\"Birthday\\").  There are parodies of The Beach Boys (\\"Back in the U.S.S. R.\\") and The Beatles themselves (\\"Glass Onion\\").  John Lennon explores revolution as politics (\\"Revolution 1\\") and experience (\\"Revolution 9\\").  Paul McCartney hauntingly asks, \\"can you take me back where are people, brother can you take me back?\\"  Each of the album's nearly thirty songs, plus assorted fragments, is unique. Together, they make up a library of styles reaching across all of music.    To truly listen to The White Album is to wonder if, in the midst of its immensity, The Beatles have found their old voices.  It is a question vital not only to these four musicians but to our entire era, for what we are asking about The Beatles we must also ask of ourselves.  As we drift into a trackless future, is there a way back to our foundations?  Somewhere in The White Album is an answer.
B000089J0R|2.0|What I mean is, just about every song on here sounds like the one before. No variety. Not to mention the fact that I believe the whole band is trying to see who can either out play the other before one drops on his face or who can play the fastest. Doesn't keep one's attention. Really the only good thing about this, is the album cover.
B000002LK1|5.0|Probably my second favorite dm album, behind black celebration. Production is phenominal. Each song has a great synth hook.
1932907009|4.0|As a novice filmmaker, I must say that this book is great.  It is filled with little tips and tricks everywhere and was written by a produced screenwriter.  So he gives you the tips that have worked for him in the past and have made him sell his screenplays.<br /><br />Yes, it may be a little too simple for some more advanced writers, but I definitely enjoyed reading it, learned from it, and breezed through it because it was written in a very colloquial way that was easy to read.  Love it and recommend it!
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|As with most any film, it's not half as good as the book (I strongly recommend you read the book[s] by James Redfield).  However, they did a wonderful job making it into a movie; keeping the story interesting and still delivering the overall message.  For those who are always interested in working on themselves/making themselves a better person and wanting to learn specific tools on how to do that- or those who are just interested in one way of thinking about how energy moves between people- I highly recommend you see this movie, you might just change the way you interact with people; or at least be more aware of how you give energy to others.
0446677450|5.0|This book is great! I can see how the principles work if you apply them. Even if you don't, the book is a great read and the ideas stick with you even if you don't use them. I'll let you know how it all works out for me.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I am completely haunted by this version. It was all I could think about. I have never experienced an emotional attachment to a movie as I have this. Ruth Wilson's pain and heartbreak as Jane was so convincing I felt physical pain. Toby Stephen's as Rochester has left me completely obsessed with him. It's amazing to watch him evolve from the dark and tortured bachelor to the carrying, still tortured by secrets man, who falls in love with Jane. He physically changes when he is with her. I watched some portion of it everyday for a week after I bought it because I could not get enough of Rochester. This is definitely my favorite adaptation - Toby and Ruth were superb.
0062502182|5.0|Simple fast read. Many lessons in this book. I have passed it to friends who end up buying their own. Its got a great message. I highly recommend it. If it ends up not being for you, you still had a good read with a good story that is well written. Can't go wrong!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Even if there were only level 1 on this DVD, it would be a great value. Level 1 is a great 25 minute video. (the \\"20 minute\\" refers to the length of time on the circuits, not including warm up and cool down/stretching). But the fact that there are two other intense and challenging workouts on this dvd makes it a fantastic value! I am a regular exerciser and in fairly good shape. After having done the level 1 workout a couple of times I am at the upper end of level 1 (except for the pushups) and plan to alternate levels 1 and 2 for variety and to transition up a level.     This workout is great for people who find most traditional workout videos \\"okay, but not terribly challenging.\\" it will help keep you from plateauing. I was thinking as I showered afterwards that the last time a shower felt this refreshing after a workout was when I used to do 1.5 hours of cardio at the gym -- but this was only 25 minutes!     If you have knee problems, be forewarned: she does not modify some of the exercises (like jumping jacks.) Even though she says \\"I've seen 400 pound people do jumping jacks and you can too\\" if you actually have serious knee problems, you'll need to modify the moves yourself.    Good luck!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I've never seen anything like this series! Like the product review says, it's quite simply the best nature/wild life show ever made!!!!! I can't think of anything that even comes close. It's a masterpiece! What's also nice about it, is there isn't an environmental agenda being pushed in the wonderful narration of David Atteneborough. Just a lot of fascinating information, along with perfectly chosen and executed music. I can't recommend it enough!!!
B0013A1T8I|5.0|I can see through all of the negativity and find a nugget of truth.  Everyone thinks this movie was bad and boring, well, I have a question for you. What movie were you watching?  When I saw this movie it captivated me and filled me with wonder.  I haven't felt this way about of movie in some odd years.  I mean, come on!  Say this with me, all right? Polar bear battle that alone made me want to watch this, I really cannot believe all the bad reviews, there not even justified.  You people are uninspired and so used to crappy movies that you misrepresent yourself.  I have seen my fair share of crappy movies but this is a good movie and I can't wait for the next one.  The story is an epic one and I am in it to the very end. The cast amazing starting with Mr 007 himself Daniel Craig and the vivacious Nicole Kidman.  It was an amazing ride and I fell in love with the characters and felt a real connection.  It was like Harry Potter with the Lord of the rings and Narnia all rolled into one massive new trilogy.  It was faced paced, heart wrenching, and heartwarming tale of friendship and loyalty.  The ending was not, I repeat not a cliff hanger, so shut up about it.  It was a very solid ending and climax mixed in with shocking plot twist that honestly I didn't see coming.  So please don't listen to any negative reviews and shy away from this passionate film adaptation of His Dark Materials.  See it yourself and then decide.  I really appreciate all the positive feed back from readers of my reviews. Thanks I appreciate it!  Look for other reviews and check them out.

0440234743|5.0|The Testament, by John Grisham is a story about a multi-billionaire named Troy Phelan.  He is preparing his last will and testament for his family.  His family consists of three ex wives, and five childrens.  Basically he can not stand any of them.  Upon Troy's death, the only people who know about what is in his will are two lawyers.  One of those lawyers is fresh out of rehab and sent out to look for one of the heirs in the swamps of Brazil.  This book was very hard to put down.  Grisham had twists and turns throughout the book.  If you have never read one of his books, this is a great place to start.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|A must have for any Blade Runner fan.  The behind the scenes, interviews, the making of, even the creation of the costumes are fantastic!  Disc set also includes the final version, with awsome music scores and special tweeking that leaves subtle clues as to what's really going on. Hint: watch the eyes.
B000WTBMBK|4.0|I found a review of this album on Pitchfork Media and while I've always had a love-hate relationship with that website's reviews something struck a chord with me and when they named it the 10th best album of 2007 I decided to give Burial's \\"Untrue\\" a shot. I'm really glad I did because it's one of the best discs of 2007. A tight combination of electronic, soul, dubstep (a new genre I was not familiar with before hearing this) and a little hip-hop, the music is indescribably good, with synths floating behind practically every track, vocals at times strangely altered, frenetic beats, and dub bass making it presence known here and there.     You know you're in for a special listening experience when a sound clip from David Lynch's film \\"Inland Empire\\" is used in the opening track \\"Untitled\\". My favorite tracks are \\"Ghost Hardware\\", the poignant, hypnotic \\"Endorphin\\" with alien sounding vocals, \\"Dog Shelter\\" with its gentle, bittersweet synths and the relentless, bouncy \\"Shell of Light\\" with it's beautiful female backing vocals and dreamy outro that lasts for a gorgeous 1 min. 15 seconds. Many of the tracks generate images of the gritty, urban rain-washed streets of London.    The music on this album sounds like a perfect mixture of Massive Attack, 90's electronic-techno greats Future Sound of London, and the UK hip-hop outfit The Streets. The music envelops you in an almost otherwordly, melancholy atmosphere, great to listen to all alone on a rainy Sunday morning.     I may have to give Pitchfork more credit than I'm used to, since they really hit a bull's eye on this one.
B000XNZ7LG|5.0|I recently purchased from amazon.com the movie \\"The Pianist\\" in HD-DVD. Everything was perfect! The quick shipping, the excellent protective packaging, the price and the movie itself! This film is an extremely moving depiction by Adrien Brody of the true story of accomplished  pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman and his powerful,inspiring determination to survive the horrors of the Nazi occupation of Poland during World War II.     The video and audio quality of this HD-DVD is absolutely first rate!    Whether you are a student of history, or just a lover of great movies, this is one not to be missed!
0307237702|5.0|The writing in this second book by Sen.Obama was excellent. It gave me a clearer idea of his political evolution and where he truly stands. His brutal honesty was a major plus which left me to laugh or ponder as I was reading it. Awesome job!

B00003CXCD|5.0|My wife and I saw this wonderful movie on DVD last night for the very first time, eventhough we are both old enough to have seen it in a movie theater in the 50s. The storyline has been explained many times here, so I'll not go into it again. Audrey Hepburn was simply beautiful and played the role perfectly of a princess wanting to live a \\"normal\\" life and do all of the things she wanted to do, dreamed of doing, for just one entire day. Peck was typically restrained as the man who wanted that one BIG SCOOP to further his career as a newspaperman and land himself his dream of working in New York City. Her dreams come true and is surprised to find love among them, if only for twenty-four hours, he sacrifices his dream of being a star reporter for love of her.     This was the perfect movie for two romantics who are generally unimpressed with today's lifeless actors, four-letter-word infused dialog, and plotless movies. Highly recommended.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|This a wonderful romp through a more peace filled time remembered.  The music is wonderful.  It's the Beatles.  What more needs to be said.  And the movie is so cute and sweet.  In the struggles of every day life now, this movie brings back the gentleness and the victory our generation grew up on and the fact that \\"ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE.\\"  It reminds us that if we can only pull together, we can accomplish anything.  Afterall, we stopped a war and brought our people home.  We could do it again if we united ourselves like we did back then.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|This movie is filmed \\"camcorder\\" style by one of the characters, who amazingly keeping filming during all this melee, which means the picture is constantly moving and the more action, the more \\"bobbing\\" around and upside scenes or pictures of the street.  I think it is true to someone running around with a camcorder and I'm sure considered creative.  But, I was tired when I rented this and wanted to have something to watch while I relaxed.  The jarring photography was a headache to watch, the beginning is slow and confusing and I didn't finish watching the rest.

1594489505|5.0|This book is better than Kite Runner - which I also liked a lot.  Not a book for the weak of heart, but a great way to really get what the women in the Middle East have dealt with.  A GREAT story, with some great history thrown in - probably the best book I read all year.
B00003CXA2|5.0|It's  story that haunts a person.  Each time its seen you find something you hadn't noticed before.
B000093FLA|4.0|A great follow-up to \\"Lock/Stock\\".  Not quite as many twists and turns, but darned close.  A fine film that stands on its own, but it helps to know the history of the characters.  Watch \\"Lock\\" and \\"Snatch\\" back to back and you'll be in for a filmfest treat.

0452289963|5.0|I purchased this book because I felt it would assist me in my search for spirituality.  I am not disappointed.  This is a wonderful reading experience and I also have participated in the online classes given by Eckhart and Oprah.  I have had many moments of realization while reading and watching 'A New Earth'.  If you're 'ready' this is a great 'awakening' book.    Try it.  You may be surprised.
0767840135|2.0|I'm a great fan of CdS, and most of their DVDs are outstanding. But IMHO Quidam rates 4/10.  Any other CdS DVD I've ever watched, any other, is substantially better, some are 10/10.  But this isn't their best production by any stretch, again, IMHO.  Smoke it if you've got it but don't go out of your way for this installment.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great, quick, hard workout. It has 3 20 minute workouts that get harder with each level. I would say it is geared toward intermediate exercisers.  I have been exercising for YEARS and started at level 1 for a week.  I have been doing level 2 for 2 weeks now and it is still very challenging.  The only thing I didn't like about it, is there are no directions with the DVD on how to use it (how many days a week, do you add extra cardio)  I was unsure if I should do it every day because you are not supposed to lift weights for the same muscle group every day.  BUT  a free 30-day trial at jillianmichaels.com was included in mine and I went on the message boards and found some vague answers to my questions.  (One person said she e-mailed \\"them\\" and they said it was o.k. to do this workout on consecutive days due to the nature of the exercises)  It does get a tiny bit tedious doing the workout every day, but it's ONLY 20 minutes!!!!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|As a long time Stargate fan I was glad to see the gate world story continue.

B00006AW2L|5.0|The Rolling Stones' Aftermath was quite a big deal back in 1966 when it was first released. Their first album in stereo, it featured experimental instrumentation and arrangements, all songs were Jagger/Richards compositions (for the first time) and it included a #1 hit single with Paint It Black. It just got pushed to the back of the room when The Beach Boys released [[ASIN:B000002UDV Pet Sounds]] and The Beatles followed with [[ASIN:B000002UAU Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]] the next year. And when the Stones themselves released their classic [[ASIN:B000003BEM Beggars Banquet]] album in 1968, Aftermath suddenly seemed like old news. It still doesn't take away the fact that Aftermath is the Stones' best early (pre-Beggars Banquet) album, and one of my personal all-time favorites from the band.<br /><br />It opens with a total classic, Paint It Black. Not many songs dare to go where this one does, into the bleak and dangerous world of depression. With an Indian beat that's augmented by Brian Jones playing the sitar, the song rocks in and out of two different formats while Mick Jagger sings of living in hopelessness.<br /><br />Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts<br />It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black<br /><br />Stupid Girl is a mod/hip London scene groupie put-down, and the refined Lady Jane shows an uncharacteristically disciplined side of the band (Brian plays the harpsichord). The marimba (Brian again) and guitar rock Under My Thumb is a classic that's still playing on classic rock radio stations today, and is one of the Stones' greatest songs. Kinda hard to resist the get-even politics, isn't it?<br /><br />Under my thumb<br />The girl who once had me down<br />Under my thumb<br />The girl who once pushed me around<br /><br />The slide guitar blues of Doncha Bother Me is a real winner, and then they go bluesy country with acoustic guitars and a harmonica on High And Dry. Keith Richards shows off some nice guitar work on both. Flight 505 has an old-timey piano intro that gives way to a laid-back rock n' harmony exercise, and It's Not Easy is an irrestible toe-tapping Chuck Berry sounding rocker. I Am Waiting is a strange and hypnotic bit of country psychedelia that features the omnipotent Brian Jones on the dulcimer.<br /><br />The album closes with Going Home, an eleven minute blues epic that starts out innocently enough, but then embarks on a dark, sexual and shamanistic trip into the unknown night. Mick Jagger's sensual vocal improvisations and spirit channeling over a heavy bass and harmonica blues jam won't appeal to the more tidy and polished Stones fans, but it's quite a fascinating piece of work.<br /><br />Bottom line, Aftermath is an essential part of The Rolling Stones catalog and a top-notch Rolling Stones production.

B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I was advised to state that my comments on Cloverfield amount to a spoiler. So... Warning : spoiler. But I actually question if there is a spoiler to this film. In retrospect of having seen the movie I think that the trailer is completely honest. The only thing hidden in the trailer is the exact shape of the \\"entity\\" that beheads the statue of liberty. What the heck is \\"Cloverfield\\"? It's simple. \\"Cloverfield\\" is a terrible movie.     Do not waste your time or money seeing this movie. This is a cheap rip off film which can be best summarized as \\"blaire witch\\" meets \\"godzilla\\" with an overdose of post-911 fear thrown in. Why induce 911 references and play off that remaining fear? Because this movie is so lame that it needs cheap references to 911 to get any excitement going what so ever. The only good thing you can say is that it is short - only 80 minutes long. But even at 80 minutes it is way too long - exactly 75 minutes too long. I found myself yawning with boredom. No amount of special effects or jerky camera work can save this snoozer.    But a boring horror/scifi film might just end up being simply bad or average. Not Cloverfield. The thing that raises Cloverfield to the status of terrible movie is that it is so incredibly, completely, and utterly unoriginal. Blaire Witch was not a great film - it was however original and creative - if annoying and slightly nauseating due to jerky camera action. It used low budget techniques to tell a scary story. Like it or not there was creative thought and originality in that film. It made the most of low tech.    In 1954 Ichiro Honda's Gojira,  (Godzilla for the US release), was a ground breaking film that inspired an entire genre of films, spoke to the horrors of the atomic age, decried the racist occupation of Japan, and honestly foreshadowed the horrors of the 911 attacks. Filmed on shoe string budget in post war Japan, Gojira in it's original uncut 90 minute release was a remarkable and chilling film. Honda used lowtech effects to create moving and terrifying cautionary tale of retribution for the horrors of nuclear war. Though modern audiences now jaded by overwhelming overused special effects may have difficulty connecting with the special effects of 1954, Gojira still stands up, and still sends a chill down the spine. The opening credits set the tone, from a completely black screen bold white characters burst forth with the awesome roar of Gojira and the rumble of giant foot steps. In 2008 that roar and those foot steps assaulting the silence of the theatre still inspire real fear. One can only imagine the effect on audiences of 1954.    What does Cloverfield inspire? Boredom and nausea. Nausea not born of anxiety - but rather motion sickness from jerky camera work. Warning! This movie will make you motion sick! So this is a movie that is completely unoriginal. A movie that shamelessly steals it premise from two well known movies. That's pretty terrible. Add to that the fact that the main characters are undeveloped, unlikable, and incredibly stupid, and you have a stunningly bad movie.     Since I have a personal interest in movies about giant monsters who flatten cities I went to see this movie with the hope of seeing something original. Such a premise offers the possibility of a mystery or a surprise... or some clever twist that would pay tribute to the original - the great Gojira. An homage? I mean it seemed so obvious that there was some unknown monster out there tearing up the city - so obvious that no one in their right mind could simply leave it at that - especially after all the hype. Maybe Gojira would show up. There had to be more right? Right? Wrong. I guess all the remakes - Godzilla vs Rodan, vs, Mothra, vs Monster X, All monsters must Die, Godzilla 2000 - just slipped the minds of the producers - is that it?    No this movie is exactly what it is - there is no surprise. Giant monster attacks New York. Buildings crash into clouds of dust that leave New Yorkerscoughing and staggering about the post apocalyptic streets were they get eaten. (Oh yeah - plan on seeing a reference to two other famous horror films - \\"Alien\\" and \\"The Thing\\") Sheets of office paper flutter through the sky a la 911 footage. Cloverfield is a completely predictable and entirely derivative film that is driven by a highly choreographed well executed marketing campaign - that's all. Don't reward the authors and producers of this crass piece of marketing junk.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|Buyer beware!!!....on the back of this release it says \\"Music Video: 'Die Hard' performed by Guyz Nite\\" and \\"Behind the Scenes with Guyz Nite Featurette\\"....both are bold-faced LIES!! There is no video or featurette on this one (at least I couldn't find them. If anyone knows where they are I'll retract this statement). I guess Fox's idea is to bait the moron consumer by listing these unavailable features so you'll spend another $35 bucks (and thank you Amazon for offering the DVD for MUCH less than that!) on the 2 disc Special Edition that actually DOES have these features!!    This is a fantastic movie, but if I had paid $8 to see it in the theater in it's original PG-13 'kiddies' version, I would have beat the theater owner to a pulp and taken my $8 back!!!    It's really a serious sad statement of human morals when it's ok to rate a movie PG-13 for a movie that shows people shot in the head and people being gunned to death....but when a simple \\"F\\" word gets uttered it forces the MPAA to rate it R!!!! So, the utterance of the \\"F\\" word is worse than people being slaughtered? That's just pathetic. And why bother censoring the movie so it would get a PG-13 anyway? The first 3 Die Hard's were all rated R....it didn't seem to limit their popularity at all!! It's not a REAL Die Hard movie without hearing John McClane utter the famous line \\"Yippee-Ki-Yay Mother F*****\\"!! is it? That's like removing the line \\"Asta la Vista\\" from Terminator 2, or \\"I coulda been a contenda\\" from On The Waterfront!! What's the point???    If you like special features but don't like being scammed and lied to, buy the 2 disc Special Edition of this film before you plunk $30 down (and again, thank you Amazon for offering it for MUCH less than that!!!.....Amazon ROCKS!!) for this version, which most obviously makes you believe there are features on the disc that do not exist!!    Otherwise...what a cool 3rd sequel to one of the best action films ever made!!! I'm probably dreaming here, but I'd love to see Bruce Willis make a couple more of these before it's all over!
B000W93CHC|5.0|How often have we waited for a sequel to a great book and been disappointed. Too many to count. To call this a sequel to Pillars puts the book in a risky light. Its a stand alone, and does not require the reader to have read Pillars. World Without End is fantastic and is equally as good as his first effort. Do we really have to wait 18 years for the next as we did after Pillars? If we do it will have been worth the wait should it be as good as WWE.
0440237688|5.0|This book is about a boy, named Jonas who lives in what seems to be like a special community that is protected from everything. At first, it is a bit difficult to understand the rules of the community because they are not displayed early on for the reader. However, they are learned throughout the entire book. The rules of the family consist of: you cannot lie, each family must eat at the same time, they must tell about their dreams and fellings, and there are no secrets. Every child in the community experiences the same thing, and even receive the same gift for their birthdays. It is not until age nine that they can even ride a bicycle. However, age 12 is the most important brithday. This is when the children are assigned their job or duty within the community. The protagonist, Jonas, is given the most important job of the Receiver. He is allowed to lie, have secrets, and may not tell anyone what occurs at his job. The Giver is Jonas' trainer for his job, and he receives many things from the Giver. He is told he will learn about rain, snow, fire, the sun, and another world. The first memory he recieves is of snow, where he is sledding. The next memory is pain, while he is sledding he goes over ice, falls off his sled, and hurts his leg. At this point in the story it is explained that every time someone gets hurt, they receive a pill, and they don't receive pain. Jonas is the only one in the community who can feel pain.    At the beginning of the book Jonas' father (who is the Nurturer), brings home a baby named Gabriel. Jonas realizes that him Gabriel are the only two in the community with Hazel eyes. Everyone else has dark eyes. Later, Jonas also notices that the Giver also has Hazel eyes. He puts all of this information together, and knows that Gabriel will be the next Receiver. One night, when Gabriel is crying Jonas accidentally gives him a memory. Throughout the book Jonas is faced with hardships. He is traumatized when he realizes that his father actually kills babies that don't belong in the community. THis transformation, and growth in his character makes him begin to think about leaving. His last memory that is given to him is the memor of the outside world. Jonas decides to try and find the place, and leaves one night with Gabriel in  search of it. In the end, Jonas and Gabriel die of starvation and freezing temperatures.   All of the aspects of this book are very dramatic and shocking for readers. It is a fantasy story, but could also be classified as a science fiction novel. Due to the content of the book, and the depth at which it can be analyzed it would be more appropriate for Juniour High or High School students. Children in this age range will be more able to think about the book and its true meaning about social norms. Classroom debates about having a sheltered community could be held with these students. The novel presents these topics in a very shattering way which draws in readers, and sparks motivation. However, a concern would be the emotional readiness of the reader to tackle a book that speaks out against things that are different from our society. One example is that, in the novel children are not nurtured by their parents while they are infants. They are nurtured by the Nurturers in the community, and then assigned to a family. This is a concept  that may be too abstract for a younger audience. This book could be tied into any type of skill development while teaching reading. These skills included questioning, prediction, and of course the idea of forming opinions as readers. I na Social Studies class when introducing classroom debates, this story could be shared to illustrate a different culure, and teams could be formed to support various reader opinions on some of the themes in the book. It is a high quality book, that while it uses simple language it messages are brought with very descriptive words  that help readers picture what is going on  throughout the story.
B000V6BE6C|4.0|Up until 2 days ago, all I knew of Avenged Sevenfold were the 2 songs regularly played on Kerrang! TV here in the UK. I liked those enough that when I was wandering through the local HMV store, I noticed that the self-titled CD was on sale and decided to treat myself. And what a treat it has turned out to be. First of all, if you like your metal loud and screaming, non-stop and unintelligible, then this CD may not be for you. Granted there are a couple of tracks that roll around like a thunderstorm caught between two hills, but this CD has much more to offer. Lyrics that at first listen sound innocuous enough but on deeper reading become very dark and vicious, juxtapose wonderfully with soaring guitar work and M Shadows' gravel-in-honey voice. And right when you think they are a full-blown metal gatepost, you are sidelined with the gorgeous lament of being far from home and missing your girlfriend. Genius!<br /><br />In an age when most bands actually want to be labeled as a certain genre, Avenged Sevenfold seem perfectly at ease with doing whatever comes to mind. They look metal. They can write with a goth sorrow. They can be as sarcastic as the best punk offerings. The orchestral arrangements add so much to already full songs, and the musicianship and production are polished and swaggering. M Shadows struck me at first glance as another Chester from Linkin Park; he still does but if anything his vocal range is greater and smoother, this guy can sing and growl as required. He is also by far the best eye candy of the quintet, though none of them are shrinking violets and are sure to have their fair share of groupies.<br /><br />The CD opens with the bitter and twisted \\"Critical Acclaim\\", setting the goth tone with an intro on a church organ. The cover notes don't say which of the band write the songs, but M Shadows gives it perfect credence with his ranting in mid-tune. Hot on it's heals comes the single that broke the band in the UK, \\"Almost Easy\\". It's melodic riff and broken pace is commercial enough for the accountants but distinct enough to do the business. Track 3 is \\"Scream\\", a mix of gothic and bluesy vocals with a chorus that reminds me of old Bond themes, there is something sinister about this song that surfaces again later on the CD. Another great guitar segway leads into a manic chain-saw reminiscent moment; perhaps the band have been watching American Psycho?<br /><br />The second single from the CD arrives in a funereal mourning of strings full of of false pretenses as \\"AfterLife\\" launches into more fast-paced guitars and drums. As M Shadows laments that he shouldn't be there, the listener is never quite sure if he is the damned or the devil, his voice has such a dangerous edge. By now we know the lad can sing, but track 5 is a wonderful diversion from the metal noise we've had so far. \\"Gunslinger\\", perhaps inspired by the Stephen King series \\"The Dark Tower\\", begins with an acoustic blues air as if it's sitting out on the porch with the sun setting over a dusty plain. Shadows cant keep his voice in check for more than a verse though, and everyone else wants in on the action, lifting the song to classical proportions. This could be the next single; it is certainly commercial enough and shows the band's range. It feels like an Guns and Roses effort, but with less whining from Axel and more soul from Shadows. \\"Unbound\\" brings us back to familiar territory with busy guitars, but wait, is that a piano? Younger British rock fans will feel at home with this track as it strongly echoes the rocksters Eliot Minor with lots of intricate scales rising and falling on a bed of frantic drums. The child-sung bridge is a little unnerving, but it is probably meant to be: Avenged Sevenfold seem happy to make you as uncomfortable as possible while lulling you into parting with your time and money willingly. If I had to pick one track as the filler for this CD, \\"Unbound\\" would be it, but only if I absolutely had to pick one.<br /><br />Another strange twist comes with \\"Brompton Cocktail\\" and yes, those are bongos. After wanting to leave the After life earlier in our travels, M Shadows seems to have changed his mind and is now embracing his own end. The title suitably refers to a gothic era, and there is something very Evanescence about this track. Is Shadows the male equivalent to the delectable Amy Lee? You decide. With \\"Lost\\" the band return to the opening theme of not being happy with their leaders. This is an anti-war song that assaults the ears with the power of a stealth bomber. And yet more unusual sounds, as Shadows' vocals are fed through a distorter for the chorus, in case the song needed any more edge. Which it doesn't. Track 9 is a romp to rival any dark Victorian-style horror show; if you don't read the lyrics sheet then it is a good quirky song, but delve into the words and you will find a gruesome and violent story with a manic-sarcastic lilt that buffers sickness with humour. As Shadows tells us \\"She was never this good in bed ~ not even when she was sleepin'\\" you just know he is serious. It really is a masterpiece but not for those with a delicate disposition, and I imagine Tim Burton being desperate to get his hands on the contract for the video for this one.<br /><br />The CD ends with another gorgeous ballad, \\"Dear God\\". Coming directly after \\"A Little Piece of Heaven\\" the contrast is welcome and jarring at the same time. Leave 'em wanting more has always been the motto of the best entertainers, and with this Avenged Sevenfold have surely succeeded.with \\"Brompton Cocktail\\" and yes, those are bongos.

B000YABYLA|5.0|I think this movie was even better than the previews suggested.  This is a movie you can watch over and over again.  There are subtleties and I believe the best aspect of this film is that not everything is explained or shown.  Details of the story are left out, things happen quick, and you don't see everything that you might expect to happen in the story but that is why the movie is so memorable and unique.  I highly recommend purchasing it, in this version or the two copy version.
B000F48CD8|4.0|Buy it on vinyl; trust me on this.  \\"Broken Boy Soldiers\\" is made to be played LOUD, and nothing does loud like vinyl.  Jack White makes this old dude very happy by releasing his stuff on LP.    And as to the \\"it's only 30 minutes long\\" nonsense?  \\"Rubber Soul\\" is less than 30 minutes; Joni's \\"Song to a Seagull\\" is not much longer.  As James Brown once said, \\"You hit it and quit it\\".  Darn right; we're not buying groceries here.    If you like '70s era Zep styled music, \\"Broken Boy Soldiers\\" is a must.
0440234743|1.0|Grisham is the master of the unnecessary detail. He pads out his story by telling us more than we want to know.  I guess I'm in a minority, but I found \\"The Testament\\" a colossal bore.
B000002UAC|5.0|People. As you know, your beloved Metamorpho can transport himself to different eras. Or so I've told you. And you have no reason to believe otherwise because nobody knows what is real or illusion more than a true Seer. And complete devotion is required, but not a pre-requisite. So, believe me, even with your own limitations on \\"reality\\". But - to the point, I can travel time with the help of certain ingredients, such as, malted milk shakes, caesar sald dressing, and salted cashews. There are, of course, other things I add. But they are kept secret because then everybody would time travel. Just think. Cleopatra would be bothered incessantly by lonely men in New York City. Not good people. And, besides, my special brew isn't even known by Colonel Saunders ( or his employees). Special. Huh?<br /><br />Anyway, this time I wound up at some place in Liverpool called the Cavern Club. I think it was somewhere in the early 60's. Anyway, while nursing a drink and watching the mayhem a band on stage was creating, a man named Brian Epstein sat at my table. \\"What do you think of them\\"?, he asked. \\"Oh, I don't know\\", I said. \\"I think they are good but kind of rough looking. They sound good... but I don't know about that drummer\\". \\"You're quite right\\", he said, \\"but that can be taken care of\\", as I noticed a cheshire cat smile spring across his face. \\"And who are you\\"?, I inquired. \\"I am their new manager and I have very big plans for them\\", he replied. \\"Well\\", I said with total aplomb, \\"You'll never sell this group with them looking like street hoods. Clean them up - give them matching outfits, and maybe you'll have a shot\\", I said, nursing a shot of brandy. \\"You know, you're right\\"!, he said with great excitement. \\"Yes. and while you're at it, ditch that drummer for one more lovable. He just doesn't fit in\\", I said with total audacity (which is one of my strong points). \\"I will talk to them. Thanks\\"! And he ran off leaving me there to search for a Seeress. Take my word people, a Seerest was in very short supply in the early 60's. (I can say no more).<br /><br />Anyway, this review is about that group. A group that broke all the boundaries. Personally, I thought that this Brian Epstein was looney to consider managing them and yet, yet, at that club I heard something that was great. Something that had a certain charisma - an appealing and infectious sound. They were different, sure, but with a sound that was filtered with their own cohesive abilities. They did old tunes with their own sound. And, to me, this was very new and interesting and alluring for the time.<br /><br />Little did I know that after their first effort, they would go on to produce this perfect pop masterpiece. And, make no mistake about it, it truly is a pop masterpiece. We are talking about the Beatles, as you know. And they went on in future years to produce many masterpieces. But, for me, in regards to sheer joy, uplift, youthful exhuberence, and rock that was entirely unique and different than what had come before, this is a shining beacon in their catalog and everso shall remain.<br /><br />What strikes me as so fresh is the interplay of vocals between Lennon and McCartney and the harmonies within. Add to that these chords that were never used in pop music before such as the ending of \\"It Won't Be Long\\" and the beginning of \\"All I've Got to Do\\". What is incredible to consider is the total group effort to making every nuance of sound count. They were a united unit at this point, each one adding an essential piece to a much bigger puzzle.<br /><br />Of all their albums, and there are many, none of them make me happier than this one. It grooves, it loops, it does somersaults in the soul somehow. I mean, sure, this music conveys teen angst and the yearning of young love which was so prevailent at the time. But, it's the energy, the pop hooks, the construction of what they were doing which is so imprortant here.<br /><br />You can't help but be caught up in this sound. The frantic strumming and oh so appropriate lead guitar in \\"All My Loving\\". The side by side rythmn and picked out lead in George's \\"Don't Bother Me\\". The harmonica rocker of \\"Little Child\\" with Lennon's exclaimation whoop! And let's not forget McCartney's foray into doing a show tune, \\"Till There Was You\\". What rock group of the time would have dared do this tune? But they did. And, got away with it too boot!<br /><br />They took known songs and made them their own. \\"Please Mr. Postman\\" \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\", and \\"You've Really Got a Hold On Me\\" are examples of this.

B0007GAEGC|5.0|Their music continues to prove just how sweet voices can be raised in harmony and can envolk flights of fantacy as you listen to their music. For someone raised on folk and pop music from the years of protest over the Vietnam war it is a joy to be able to listen to music that is undrestandable.
B000031EGV|4.0|*may contain spoilers*  On the surface, Jumanji appears to be an actual child's game, meant for amusement purposes, with a surprising twist. Upon further examination, it becomes clear that Jumanji itself is NOT a game, but a metaphor for the difficulties our souls must face before we can confront our fears. At the beginning of the film, Alan Parish is burdened by his inability to confront his fears; a problem which may, in an almost Freudian manner, stem from a strained relationship with his own father. \\"Jumanji\\" is a physical representation of this burden, and since at the time he is unable to confront it, he is pulled into the jungle of his fears, unable to escape. He overcomes his flaws not only when he \\"beats the game\\", but, as we see thanks to both Van Pelt and Alan's father being played by the same actor, when he finally has the strength to confront his father. I did not care for the subplot involving jungle animals wreaking havoc on the city, but this is merely an unhelpful footnote in a powerful story of one boy's self-actualization.
6304936362|5.0|\\"Memphis Belle\\" is in my top 10 movie list.  (Last count, there's 53.)  The film is based on a true story of heroism during WWII.  A real, air-worthy B-17 was used and the interior shots were filmed in sections built according to the original Boeing blueprints.  I admire authenticity.  The actors were well casted but Matthew Modine and Sean Austin stood out for me as very believable characters.  This movie made me a fan of Harry Conick jr.  Words don't do it justice; just get it for your collection.
B000092ZYX|1.0|Frankly I thought this album was dead boring. Then again I don't really like Radiohead in the first place. If you do like them I guess you'd probably like this album, but if you prefer your music a little more lively it might not be for you.
0316113077|1.0|I have to agree with those who rated this book on the low end. Elisa Strauss is a great decorator; however, the recipes are totally inaccurate. The cake recipes make more than you need, and the bake times are off for the baker at home. For example, I tried making cupcakes once, and ended up with more like 40 cupcakes - NOT the 24 the recipe supposedly makes. I'm no novice in the kitchen, especially at baking. The buttercream recipe was off also, and way, way, way too sweet to even top a cake! It's pure sugar-tasting and it was just gross. I also agree with the comments on the cookie recipe--inaccurate and the flour is much too much than what is required for the recipe. Maybe she will write another book with better, TESTED recipes--that is, not tested in large quantity in a professional kitchen, but at home.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you want to look at the cake pictures (most of which don't even seem worth the time because they are too done up to be edible, and don't really taste that good with the loads of fondant on them) for ideas, don't bother getting this book. I think people who rated 5 stars did not use recipes from the book. So, just borrow it from the library and make notes on the ideas instead of spending the cash.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Great movie. I have been a Stargate viewer since the first movie in the ninties. Sorry to see new programming ended it was the only program I looked forward to on a weekly basis.<br /><br />The Ark of Truth was a very good movie and finally draws a conclusion to the Ori saga. Good special effects (as usual)with a couple previous actors revived for the conclusion. Enjoyable and fun movie for the Scifi fan.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian does an awesome job in this workout.  20 minutes of heart pumping strength, cardio, and abs that shows results within a week.  I have been working out for several months and hit a plateau.  I start Jillian's shred and started losing again and finally started seeing the toning in my arms and legs.  This is a great investment of your money and time.  She also does a great job demonstating and explaing the exercises, unlike some of her previous programs which move too fast into the workout.
0143036556|3.0|I had higher hopes for this book after reading Guns, Germs and Steel.  But it was more difficult for me to really get into the book.  His basic assumption is any society that extracts natural resources faster than a sustainable rate will vanish unless they comes to grips with the problem and modify their behaviour so they become sustainable.  I would have thought he would have touched on other issues but the environment is the single focus of the book.  While there is a lot of truth to what he says I thought the book would discuss other reasons that societies collapse as the environment is not the only reason an economy or society will collapse.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|Very rarely does a band get 4 consecutive great albums. Rise Against, let's say, did it. Their first album was strong, with some short but powerful songs. Revolutions Per Minute blasted your ears off, and Siren Song delivered more melody. This 4th album, may I just say, keeps the spirit moving strong.    Chamber the Cartridge: 9.0/10   This sounds like the classic Rise Against! Which is a good thing. An earblasting speedy verse moving on to a slightly slower chorus.    Injection: 9.5/10  This one is one of my favorites, the intro is great and while the verse isn't much special, the chorus makes up for it entirely.    Ready to Fall: 10/10   One of the best. It focuses on animal cruelty and how we're killing the enviroment, and the verses and choruses make you want to put a stop to everything and just save animals.    Bricks: 8.0/10  Not my favorite, but it's a worthy listen with its extreme speed. It's also pretty shot clocking in at a minute an a half, but if you want something more The Unraveling style then your song is right here.    Under The Knife: 9.5/10  I used to hate this song. A lot. Then I just didn't like it. Then it got catchy. Then it got good. Now I cannot stop listening to it! You kinda have to listen to it yourself to really get it.    Prayer of the Refugee: 8.0/10  Eh.... not this song. Truth be told I think this song is overrated. It's not a bad song, and the chorus will keep you singing along through the whole thing, but they should have gone for a faster verse.    Drones: 9.5/10  I had never listened to this song in my life, but I put it on my MP3 player for no apparent reason. So I started listening to it and I was amazed! The chorus is good, and the solo.... awesome! They could have put in a better ending, but everything else: perfect!    The Approaching Curve: 9.0/10   I call this one the little oddball of the album. It sounds like Tim is speaking the verses while it is put to a moderately slow tune, before going into a melodic, sappy almost,chorus. But the cool part is Rise Against managed to do all of this the right way.    Worth Dying For: 8.5/10   Coulda easily fit along Siren Song, it's also the classic Rise Against. Fast heavy verses before being pushed into a slower but more melodic chorus.    Behind Closed Doors: 8.5/10  The first Rise Against song I actually listened to. I thought it sounded unique, and it really does. After listening to their other songs it sounded more classic, but it'll always have a special little place in my song collection. Also: If Tim has a sort of english accent you can definetely hear it in this song.    Roaside: 9.0/10  It's like The Sufferer's Swing Life Away, minus any traces of sappiness. These guys are the only band that can make hardcore punk meet acoustic work very well.    The Good Left Undone: 9.5/10   I had heard a lot about this song, but I'd never heard it. So one day I decided to do it. Needless to say, I made the right choice! The chorus, great, the verse, great, everything about it is awesome!    Survive: 10/10   There is no better way to close out this album. It starts out with a rather slow but epic intro, before going into the classic Rise Against, except more \\"oomph\\" in everything. My favorite on the album.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|This movie had me constantly laughing throughout.  A situational comedy with an awesome director.  I wasn't sure I would like this when I read the sleeve, but it was so funny that I bought it and passed it around work.
0792839692|4.0|Logan's Run is just a cool flick any way you slice it.  I'm not what you'd call a hardcore sci-fi fan(unless you're talking B flicks like It Came From Outer Space or Cat Women Of The Moon), but I do have an attraction to sci-fi films of the 70s.  As far as Set and Production design, special effects, music, and just the overall look of a lot of those films, I think they're the coolest thing.  When most folks talk about Logan's Run, they seem always seem rather quick to throw out the words, \\"cheesy\\" and \\"dated\\".  Even if they like the film they tend to throw this out right up front.  The thing is, damn near every film ever made is dated.  You think today's big budget Hollywood sci-fi films won't be referred to as having a dated look or cheesy music or FX when reviews are written 30 years from now??  If not, you'd better enjoy Transformers while you can.  As far as FX go, ya gotta realize that they were working with what they had, and it was high tech at the time just as CGI is high tech now.  In the end, FX will always take a back seat if the storytelling is good because that's the one thing that will ruin the movie if it isn't done right.  I also don't know where people are getting the idea that the acting is terrible.  It isn't terrible, it's just different from what we're used to seeing in modern day movies.  Jake Lloyd in the Phantom Menace is an example of rotten acting, not anything in Logan's Run.  But as I said before, I totally embrace the \\"cheesy\\" and \\"dated\\" aspects of the 70s sci-fi film.  Most folks know the plot to Logan's Run, but allow me to.....ahem....run through it again(actually I just needed an excuse to work that lousy pun into the review)<br />It's set in a futuristic utopian society where people live in a domed city and haven't a care in the world but indulging in whatever activities they find pleasurable.  Kind of like a horny version of the Eloi from the Time Machine.  The catch is that when they hit the age of 30, they will either die or be \\"renewed\\" through a ritual called the Carousel.  If they decide to just try to go AWOL or \\"run\\", they get blasted to smithereens by the Sandmen, a kind of police force that kills \\"runners\\".  Logan(Michael York) is a Sandman.  One day he's given an undercover assignment to seek out a place spoken of in whispers called \\"Sanctuary\\".  Sanctuary is supposedly a place Runners try to escape to.  Logan is 26, but is immediately stepped up to Runner status so he can get in with the folks who will show him the way to Sanctuary.  The sexy Jenny Agutter becomes his traveling companion(after refusing his sexual advances, but don't worry coz you know she's gonna give in), and ultimately his love.  Logan soon finds that practically no one is on his side anymore and breaks free of the dome only to find that Sanctuary isn't quite what everybody thought it was.<br />A very cool movie for sure.  It's full of sexuality that definitely wouldn't pass for a PG rating today.  It's got some cool twists and turns, a snazzy soundtrack full of electric beeps and squiggles(perfect for this kind of movie), laser surgery and a killer robot.  What the hell more can you ask for?  That's right, Homie-NOTHING!  You owe it to yourself to check it out if you haven't already.  But if you ever watched TBS than you've probably seen it many times along with The Beastmaster.  Watch it again anyway.ewed\\" through a ritual called the Carousel.

0385507755|5.0|I read  A Million Little Pieces before the Oprah controversy and again after. Even after hearing that this was a fictionalized \\"Memoir\\" it didn't take away any of the raw power this book has for me. It is one of my favorite books, it moves me deeply. I feel so much for the characters  especially James and Lilly who are two damaged individuals that reveal the ugliest parts of themselves and find solace in each other. You cannot help but feel personally invested in this story.
1881273156|5.0|Great and perfect deal from seller. Congratulation!.   And also a wonderful book, with wisdom and precepts for the good relationship for couples.[[ASIN:1881273806 The Heart of the Five Love Languages]]
0765350386|4.0|The only reason this book doesn't get 5 stars is that I enjoyed Kelsier much more as a character than Vin, yet most of the book seemed to be from her perspective.  Otherwise, this is an amazing start to what reads like an incredibly rich, well thought out, detailed fantasy series!  I love the magic and what it's based on, and can't wait to read Book 2!!!  Lots of great action, especially those last set of pages, political intrigue, interesting characters...Highly recommended.
0307237702|5.0|Senator Obama shares a deeply personal look into his journey to the Senate and his view of politics.  I strongly feel that anyone will be moved by this book, regardless of your political leanings, in that his moving prose is so illustrated by anecdotes from his family and the people he has met along the way.  That said, those involved in his campaign will be ecstatic.
0679746323|5.0|Mao Tse-tung was once the model and the object of ideological veneration for revolutionists around the world.  Whether it was South American guerillas, who squatted on their heels for hours listening to readings from his Little Red Book, or wannabe radicals from Berkeley to the Sorbonne who hung posters of his smiling image on their dorm room walls, for them Mao represented the future of world revolution.  The man had them all fooled.<br /><br />In an effort to discredit the book and its authors, critics of MAO: The UNKNOWN STORY like to point out Jung Chang's personal animosity for her subject.  People who've read Chang's prior work, WILD SWANS, are familiar with the woman's family history, that both of her parents were victims of Mao's Cultural Revolution, and that her father suffered permanent physical and mental damage from being routinely tortured while he was imprisoned.  However, should facts that are uncovered in an investigation be discredited because of the personal prejudices of the investigator, especially when, in addition to these facts, there is outside testimony which validate the biases of the investigator?  If such was the case, then much of the work published over the last half-century on fascism and National Socialism, as well as the biographies of the founders and leading figures of these movements would be discredited.<br /><br />Despite her obvious, but understandable, difficulty to proceed with much academic detachment or objectivity, Jung Chang and her husband, Jon Halliday, both put eleven years of research into the life of China's Paramount Leader, including the contents of the recently opened Soviet archives pertaining to the Chinese Communist Party and the results of their interviews with hundreds of people who knew Mao personally.  They spare no abhorrent details to Mao's life.<br /><br />A spoiled child who grew to be a physically lethargic, emotionally indifferent man, Mao was a master schemer who allowed nothing to keep him from his desires, politically or personally.<br /><br />[...]or personally.

B000WCBPOG|5.0|The singers and musicians really made the music theirs, but still kept with ideas The Beatles would do. There were a few songs I didn't like (\\"Hold Me Tight\\", \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\", and \\"It Won't Be Long\\") but everything else I adored. It was interesting to hear some soulful renditions of the songs. I was surprised and found that I liked one song better than The Beatles' original! Joe Anderson absolutely nailed \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun\\" - yes, he even topped The Beatles, and that is not something I say lightly. All around it was excellent! I highly recommend it!
B00005T30L|3.0|Ghost World could have been a lot better and more special. Thora Birch is a great actress and she's good in this unique indie film but the plot and ending leaves the audience with many unanswered questions. Steve Buscemi and Scarlett Johansson also star and the late Brad Renfro. Ghost World is based on a comic book, so expect a dark comedy. Wish I liked this film more but it is just ok for me.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I think Jillian is great! The video is definitely what she makes it out to be..hard and it works! The only thing I had a problem with was the quality of the DVD...it must have had scratches on it because the video was skipping around..other than that it was fine! I would recommend this to anyone who is trying to lose weight.
B00003CWN3|2.0|Boys Don't Cry is a cruel and violent film. Hilary Swank pulls off her best male impression but her accent and mannerisms just fall flat. I could barely see the movie, and what I mean by that is the picture quality is very dark. It was like the film was shot in complete darkness, bad lighting and cinematography. There is no happy ending and you just feel no lesson is learned, Boys Don't Cry tries to make a point but fails to deliver a hopeful message.
B0012Q732O|1.0|The producers have already wasted their time and money on this; don't waste yours! Some of the old MST3K guys have a website called RiffTrax - where they supply running mockery for \\"big\\" movies. This turkey was custom made for them. It is the only way that it should be seen by anyone.
B00009Y3L4|3.0|Carbaret starring Liza Minnelli in her Oscar-winning performance is a fun but superficial musical. The songs and dance numbers are of course brilliant thanks to Bob Fosse's genius, he also directed this film. I just couldn't get into the story and romance quality of this film. Just watch it if you're a die-hard Minnelli fan.
0525950079|5.0|If you loved Pillars of the Earth, or if you just like Historical Fiction, this is one great book.  The characters come alive, complete with background, color and scenery. This is one of those great books that I hope never becomes a movie, as no movie could do it justice. The story line is just complex enough without losing the reader.I normally am a speed reader, but this is a book I enjoyed taking time with.

This a great stand-alone film as well, filled with excitement and suspense from beginning to end, so even if you're new to Stargate, you'll enjoy this film. And if you /are/ new, you'll want to run out and get Seasons 1 to 10 right away.
0452289963|5.0|My mother saw the book on Oprah and she was impressed by the many readers who enjoyed reading it. She thought: If Jim Carrey can find a book fascinating, now how much more for me? Although, she commented on the quirky use of big words being used than using more simpler English. Over all, this book sells to anyone who wants to see what the writer's subconsious mind is thinking.

B000V86OKG|3.0|I don't have Showtime, but saw [[ASIN:B000Q6GUW0 Season 1]], only because of Michael C. Hall's apperance in HBO's [[ASIN:B000HEVZBW Six Feet Under]]. It's a highly addictive show, and I couldn't wait for Season 2.<br /><br />I heard some people saying it wasn't as good as the first one, and I MUST disagree with them. Dexter just gets better and better. For one thing, it was different from Lindsey's [[ASIN:1400095921 books]], which is SO much better than following the series with each novel. It takes Dexter in a different direction, opening up new worlds and experiences for the characters, allowing us to get a different aspect on some of the characters. And I stayed up late, losing much sleep, because I wanted to see what happened next. And with the season finale, it didn't leave with any rediculous cliffhanger for the next season...unlike the finale for [[ASIN:B001FB4W0W True Blood]], which left a cliffhanger that works fine between episodes, but just SUCKS when having to wait another year!!<br /><br />Now, to explain why I gave this GREAT SHOW 3 stars:<br />I'm VERY upset with Showtime's features on this show. There were NO deleted scenes, NO behind the scenes footage, NO commentary at at!! Only a few of the actor's bios and a handful of pics. There was plenty of room for it, but Showtime just felt it necessary to promote its other shows instead. For a sneak peak at [[ASIN:B0015ABRE2 Season 3]], you have to buy another series of Showtime programming (forget which one since I was so annoyed!!) to get the first episode. And for any other \\"extras\\" on Dexter, visit the Showtime website. I did this anyhow (before watching the series) and found a few flash-games. Nothing great, but you could have added them as extras on the DVD. Showtime really should have done better with this.<br /><br />Dexter Season 2 - 10 out of 5 STARS<br />cheap \\"extra material\\" gets 1 out of 5 stars
0718152433|1.0|I had high hopes for this recent Jamie Oliver book, based on my first quick browse through the book and also the supposed 'gardening theme'. This is once again the familiar Jamie Oliver style of cooking: heavy on the meat, fats and some strange combinations of ingredients to say the least.<br /><br />I had hoped that this would be a shift in gears for the Naked Chef. Flexing his culinary muscles to create some beautiful vegetarian and perhaps vegan fare, using all the bountiful harvests from his gardens. Not a chance. Same old, same old.<br /><br />Really should not be portrayed as a garden type of cookbook, in my opinion. And some of the photos, including one of a dead rabbit and other of game birds, be forewarned. Not for the animal lover or someone with a queasy stomach.<br /><br />I received this book as a gift. I'm planning to give it away. I tried to find at least a few recipes that I would take the time to try, amid the usual meaty Jamie fare, but not to be.<br /><br />Time to try something new Jamie Oliver. This has been done....again and again. A new cover and concept doesn't change the contents. In my opinion, definitely not worth the money, even if you do like meat dishes and heavy foods. There are a lot better mainstream cookbooks on the market out there and certainly more innovative and creative.
B0000028M7|5.0|Another great album from another great band. Dirt continues the same formula where [[ASIN:B00000272N Facelift]] left off. This album has more radio-played songs than any other from AIC's library (the most played being Rooster), but the one's that aren't played are much worth the album price (especially now at under $8).<br /><br />Dirt takes on a darker, depressing mood than Facelift, showing the audience the path of depression leading Staley to his overdose: at times the songs seem clustered and confusing, at others taking on a relaxing tone. It's a psychotic blend of moods, balancing an otherwise unlistenable album.
B000024ZLX|3.0|I won't pretend to be objective here: I never enjoyed this album. Beautifully produced, relentlessly downbeat and funereal. I first heard it at a college record store (Cutlers, Yale) broadcast on its official release date by WAVZ [WDRC?] packed with PF fans. By 10 minutes into the album, most simply scratched their heads and wandered out, profoundly disappointed. It was like listening to Side 3 of The Wall without the two great bookend pieces, Hey You and Comfortably Numb.     I've read in other sources that much if not most of FC is a compilation of songs that didn't make it into The Wall - and if they had, I doubt Wall would have been such a triumph. FC's lyrics are very dated, and there's little to relate to. Would've been much more honest if this were released as a Waters solo album.

1402210795|4.0|Georgette Heyer is, of course, the queen of the historical romance. In her career she wrote over fifty novels, many of them set in the Regency period. \\"Friday's Child\\" is another of her Regencies although it's not one of my favourites. However it still bears the hallmarks of her excellent writing skill with some particularly amusing dialogue amongst some of the young bucks in the story.<br /><br />Hero Wantage has always loved Sherry, Lord Sheringham, her neighbour. When Sherry's marriage offer is rejected by the beautiful Isabella he vows to marry the next woman he sees - which happens to be Hero. At first it's just a marriage of convenience, Sherry and his friends imagine their life won't change at all, Hero will just tag along as when they were young, but despite this rather dramatic naïvet&eacute;, as events unfold and Hero falls into scrape after scrape, Sherry has to look at things a little differently.<br /><br />Hero has always loved Sherry but as she falls into more and more trouble Sherry's exasperation turns into anger - until he begins to understand the worth of his wife. There's a kind of growing up into responsibility theme in this book, and the growing up happens particularly to Hero who wasn't brought up to be a Viscountess. The real stars of the book, for me, aren't the hero and heroine but Sherry's friends Ferdy, George and Gil. These three are fantastically amusing, good-hearted toward Hero and some of their dialogue is just brilliant.<br /><br />The youth of the hero and heroine in this book doesn't always appeal to everyone but those who enjoyed A Convenient Marriage and Cotillion will probably like this story. It's not one of Heyer's best but it's still well worth a read.<br /><br />[...]

B00114LF4E|5.0|As one of the earlier reviewers noted, this set is being offered at less than the price of Naxos discs and it has music-making far beyond what might be expected from a budget reissue.<br />I got the UK issue of this set a couple of years ago when most of these recordings were not available in the US. I've gotten so much pleasure from them since that I wish I had thought to buy them earlier.<br />The sound is very present and very accurate. It's always a pleasure. The VPO playing is also a constant joy. This set catches that orchestra in transition from its more traditional older sound that you can hear on recordings going back to before World War II and the more up-to-date sound that it later took on. Back when Karajan was making these recordings, the orchestra was still using valve trombones and its own distinctive tubas. It may still have been using wooden flutes, at least for some of the recordings.<br />There are sounds on these discs that are like nothing else on record: The almost vocal quality of the horns and strings at the end of the Brahms 3 - you could almost mistake them for a wordless chorus; the sheer mindless brutality of Mars; the gutty tug of the double basses in the slow movement of the Haydn Drumroll.<br />I don't think that the Beethoven 7 is Karajan's best recording of the piece, but it's far from shabby. The two Haydn symphonies, on the other hand, are far more compelling than his remakes in Berlin later in his career.<br />The Giselle - beautiful and elegant here - is also the subject of a famous story. It appears that the decision to record it was a spur-of-the-moment inspiration and the orchestral parts had to be shipped in. For some reason, they could not be sent as a unit and so appeared movement (or section) by movement with conductor and orchestra having the time of their lives essentially sight-reading the music with the mikes on. The joy and freshness of that experience lives on in the recording here.<br />9 discs at a time is a bit of a big gulp, but in this uncertain age, recordings don't stay in print long. This is a leap worth taking and one that brings with it hours and hours of musical rewards.a big gulp, but in this uncertain age, recordings don't stay in print long.

B000006914|5.0|\\"Don't you understand? Don't you?\\" -- Barrymore telling Garbo he loves her.<br /><br />Vicki Baum's popular novel was given the MGM treatment for the first time in \\"Grand Hotel.\\" Though it does not hold up as well as its remake, \\"Weekend at the Waldorf,\\" due to the lack of symmetry between a director and one of the stars, the overall impact is not muted in the least. It remains an entertaining time capsule to the early days of sound pictures, when MGM was just starting to roar.<br /><br />The story of a diverse group of people crossing paths and dramas, forming bonds and loving, probably seems old hat today. But this is where it all began. With names like Greta Garbo, John and Lionel Barrymore, and Wallace Berry, it is really Joan Crawford who emerged the most memorable. Her sparkling performance showed she could not only hold her own among the more heralded prestige stars, but could actually overshadow them with her charisma.<br /><br />Garbo is a lonely ballerina in need of love; love which jewel thief John Barrymore will unexpectedly and, surprisingly to him, give her, at least until his desperate need for money brings about tragedy. Lionel Barrymore shines as the dying man truly tasting life for the first time. His performance is adorable and the best here sans Crawford, whose worldly but wistful secretary in search of the good life leaves the most lasting mark.<br /><br />John Barrymore hadn't yet lost his magic and is excellent here, his performance only muted in scenes with Garbo. This can be attributed in whole to the failure of Garbo and director Edmund Goulding to mesh. Garbo gave a silent film performance in a sound film and Goulding allowed her to do so. It doesn't work for the most part, and creates some stilted moments. Only in the moments when she gives in to Barrymore's love for her does her silent radiance appear, her joy afterward and sheer happiness intoxicating to the viewer.<br /><br />Berry is also good as the heavy, but once again Crawford overshadows him. You simply can't take your eyes off her, her beauty and charisma luminous proof of her star power. William Daniels' photography, gowns by Adrian, and the art direction of Cedric Gibbons all come together to make \\"Grand Hotel\\" one of the spectacular events of early sound film and a must see for Crawford's fans.ur eyes off her, her beauty and charisma luminous proof of her star power.

B000050X31|5.0|The recording is superb and the singers are great!  I especially love Manfred Hemm's acting and singing.  His humorous acting is well worth the money spent in this DVD.  I love his green bird costume!  It's hilarious.<br />His voice is deep, moving and expressive.<br /><br />The orchestration is also very well played and recorded.  Other supporting singers are well chosen as well.<br /><br />I would love to see this live with the same people!
B0002KPIKA|5.0|We watched this DVD last night and marvelled at the unity of the vision of the production, which seemed to us perfectly French, meaning light, witty, attractive, and filled with oddly appealing little touches. As the other reviewers have said, the singing and playing are wonderful. We found the acting superior. Much effort appears to have gone into the sumptuous costumes, which we thought delightful. The sets are totally minimal, but we found them used cleverly. An example of an oddly appealing little touch: Poppea \\"hides\\" Otho and Nero in plain sight (to the audience) under swatches of see-through material from her pink skirt. We instantly know how to read the meaning of this, and, given the values of this production, we award points for ingenuity. This is now one our favorite DVDs.

0440178002|5.0|That's not an exaggeration, speaking for myself.  I picked this up from a friend who was donating books to Goodwill, and I wasn't really too excited about it; I had no major interest in Japan.  But she assured me that it was an awesome book (my copy is a 2 volume hardcover set that is old and worn, and I will never give it up), and another friend agreed.    What I loved about this the most is that Clavell's plots are so cunning; they keep you guessing.  Almost every page, or at the least every chapter, I'm saying to myself, \\"No way!\\"  \\"I didn't see THAT coming!\\"  \\"Holy crap, what?\\"  Another thing is the characters; they really are 3D, each with his or her own motivations and development through the story.  In fact, Clavell often switches perspective from one character to another, giving you a glimpse into what they're actually thinking, not just what they're doing.  Sometimes he even does this within a scene where characters are interacting; one says one thing, and then thinks another thing, and then another says something and thinks something else.  The *scheming* that's constantly going on between the daimyos and their vassals is truly epic.    The central character, Blackthorne, is complex and interesting in and of himself, but the end of the book left me pondering, \\"Was he truly the central character?\\"  Arguably not, and it's not until the very end that it becomes apparent.  But his character's development is the most interesting, I think, and it gives a fascinating look at some of the cultural differences between East and West.  I could write for pages about how much I love this book, but I'll leave it at that.  This is my first Clavell novel, and I'm tempted to just start over and re-read the thing immediately, but instead I'm going to buy another of his books and see how it compares.  James Clavell is a gem that I wish I'd discovered years ago!
0802130208|4.0|This is a story about a very weird bunch of characters. Reading this was kind of like watching 40 year old virgin and Benny hill goofyness. Some of the comedy is moronic and strange but this book was hilarious. The guy who wrote this must have been one strange individual. He couldn't get his book published and killed himself. Then his mother took the manuscript and got it published and it won a pulizter! LMAO. I enjoyed reading it, but you have to take this book in the context its written in. It is meant to be a goofy, juvenile ridiculous book. If you cant read something like that don't bother you won't like this book. The main character is something else. HE IS VERY WEIRD!

B000H8SFMK|4.0|This contains two of my all-time favorite songs, hand-down, ANY genre (and I love all genres of music, from country to bluegrass to hard rock to rap to indy rock to gospel to...you get the picture...)    TITLE TRACK (If I Should Fall from Grace with God)...the joy in this song makes me feel glad to be alive.  I love to blast this sucker when I'm driving fast, and sing along, and imagine myself in an Irish pub not giving a damn what anyone thinks, screaming the song along with Shane at the top of my lungs...what a simple, but brilliant song...    FAIRYTALE OF NEW YORK One of the most gorgeous, honest, funny, brutal, moving songs EVER written, in my humble opinion...    Those two songs alone would make this CD (and their greatest hits CD) well worth getting.  The fact that there are many other good songs on here is a bonus.      Pogue Mahone!

B00006IUL7|4.0|\\"Insomnia\\" is a combination of cat and mouse suspense between the murderer in this movie played by Robin Williams & that of a seasoned, hot shot, LA detective played by Al Pacino AND whether or not Pacino's character is in fact a good cop or good cop made into a bad cop by the system.    The acting and storyline are good, but not great in \\"Insomnia\\". Robin Williams isn't as convincing as the bad guy in this movie and the movie could have been a tad less predictable in the ending, but otherwise a good movie overall.

B00004RF97|5.0|After I saw The Philadelphia Story at our local Civic Theater, I had to see the original film.  It's a wonderful good old fashioned romance story and great to watch.  It will completely take your mind off the cares of or present everyday living and take you back to a time when you could watch a movie and not be embarrassed by the language, content or  dress.  Although this is an \\"oldie\\", it's worth every minute of the time you spend watching it...and, of course, the acting is great! I'm glad I decided to purchase it to add to my DVD library.

There is no more beautifully simplistic portrayal of childhood and its inherent responsibility to understand the complicated adult world that surrounds it.  In my estimation, we will never surpass the moral tale in this treasure.  It makes me want to be Atticus, Jem, Scout...even Tom, because of the self command that he portrays, or Boo, because of his ultimate normality and heroism...each charactar is rich and worthy of our attention, love, admiration.  This is my all time favorite American classic.

6305949980|5.0|An absolute joy to watch that will be enjoyed by families everywhere.    A top movie that has been re-launched in cinemas in some parts of the world, why? because it opens the imagination of all children and adults as well with it's unique style and unmissable detail to quality in every aspect of the film from beginning to end.    This movie has proven itself worthy amongst all other great family movies ever made and with it's compelling story and it's imagination filled and memorable characters that you get to know throughout the entire movie, this is a film that would be appreciated by everyone especially in today's day and age as when it was first released seemed to me to be a little ahead of it's time and wasn't fully acknowledged until the late nineties to today.    with amazing songs that children and yourself will love to sing along to this movie has memorable moments that you will not forget also due to it's catchy melodies and heart felt humor its a film not to be missed.
0345479092|1.0|This book discourages parents from reading their baby and following their instincts.  I found the \\"do it this way\\" attitude quite off-putting.    What I truly don't understand is why the well researched benefits to breastfeeding are down played. Of course one shouldn't feel guilty about one's feeding choice...but that does NOT mean that one should not have the information necessary to make an INFORMED choice...Informed decisions help prevent one from feeling guilt, after all!   This book fails to give parents the basic information that they need...the details about why formula is less healthy than breastfeeding, as well as the details about when breastfeeding is easer and when breastfeeding is more difficult, and how to manage both, so that they can weigh those specific issues against their own family situation, to decide whether the risks involved with formula are worth it, for _their_ family.   The book makes it sound like breastfeeding is never the best choice!    The author refers to herself as an lactation consultant, but I have been unable to find _anything_ about her credentials.  It does not appear that she is actually qualified as a certified lactation consultant (they are called IBCLC).   So calling herself an LC is misleading.
B000WCDI64|5.0|This DVD shows the immense talent, poetry, and charisma of Amy Winehouse. I highly recommend it to any of her (adult)fans. I had seen photos of her and heard all her recorded music, but I had no idea what she was like in person. This DVD is well made showing all angles of Amy and her band in concert. She sings from the heart and leaves nothing to the imagination. The DVD also shows interviews with Amy and family and friends. Besides talented, Amy is one of the most honest and frank celebs I've seen in years, though I suspect she doesn't think of herself as one. I'll watch this again and again. Warning: some may find her language harsh.
B0012GVKW8|2.0|Just echoing the comments made by several other reviewers, there's absolutely no reason at all to by the Blu-Ray version of Predator.  That assesment stands regardless of if you currently own the movie or not.<br />With virtualy no extra features at all and picture quality that doesn't look one iota better then the standard definition release (clearly the film wasn't remastered), the two disc standard definition version continues to be the edition to buy.<br />The movie is one of my favorites, but this edition represents a terrible dollar value.

0439813786|5.0|The intertwining of the intrigueing plot, fabulous gaphics and completely original format is brilliant.  This book is a piece of art.  It is beautifully bound, with high-quality paper.  The binding makes the book fall open flat, so that none of the graphics are lost in the center.  The concept of making the book resemble a movie and then being about one of film's pioneers is fascinating.      As a teacher, I am thrilled to see such high-quality children's literature being published.  A book like this helps kids love reading and books, we need so much more of that so they put away their electronic toys and READ.

I opened this book on a boat going from Fort Lauderdale to the Bahamas. I did not put it down until I had read the last page. Very few books have had me so addicted. Maybe Pinocchio when I was 10 or Dancers at the end of time by Moorcock.     Warning: This book is ADDICTIVE. Do not pick it up unless you have several hours to spare in order to finish it.

0618918248|1.0|Dawkins presents Christianity - and the belief in a god(s) in general - to be the essence of hate. He rants and raves page-upon-page at how religion in general has produced nothing but hate and malice toward the planet as a whole - including ALL of its inhabitants - for thousands of years. Yet, Dawkins \\"argument\\" [more like a tantrum exhibited by a 2-year old] produces nothing but PURE hate and genuine hostility toward anyone, regardless of their beliefs, who doesn't express the same views as he.

The absence of intelligent thought is overwhelming and sickening - you will lose brains cells if you read this book.

B00005JPSM|4.0|'No Reservations' is a low-key romance with a lot of heart.  Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Kate, a head chef of a fancy restaurant who's a serious perfectionist to the letter.  (She even confronts customers who complain.)  When her sister and Zoe (Abigail Breslin), her neice, come to visit, a terrible car accident leaves her sister dead and Zoe an emotional wreck.  Taking time off, her quietly assertive owner/manager (Patricia Clarkson, '[[ASIN:B0014D5RBE Lars and the Real Girl]]') replaces her with a temp, a skillful and freewheelin' sous chef, Nich Palmer (Eckhart).  Holding her career dear, Kate must come to terms with her newfound responsibilities raising Zoe while keeping her job and making new discoveries as Nich helps her to lighten up and discover how the other half lives.  An exuberant lunatic, he plays the kitchen like a conductor of the arias he's so fond of.  Beautiful music and Nick's heartfelt love for Italian culture give the film the proper ambiance it needs.      Taking familiar dramatic ingredients, the characters and timing are all combined to make a truly palatable viewing experience.  Engaging performances by Zeta-Jones, Eckhart, Clarkson, and Breslin give this romantic dramedy the right touches.  Catherine Zeta-Jones won my heart for her performance, and Aaron Eckhart, whose multi-faceted acting ability has been best as the villain, proves he's a worthy romantic lead.  (I was one of the few who wasn't impressed with '[[ASIN:B000JJ5G4W Conversation(s) With Other Women]]' even though I liked his dour performance as \\"the guy\\" with Helena Bonham Carter.)  Carol Fuch's winsome screenplay (based on 'Mostly Martha' by screenwriter, Sandra Nettelbeck) sets the right mood, taking the movie through courses of comedy and seriousness with nearly flawless timing. Very light, romantic, and engaging.
B000053VAZ|4.0|Mary Stewart Masterson and Johnny Depp are very good in this film. She is terrific as Joon, the sister of Benny, the over-protective brother. Comic moments are sprinkled liberally thoughout the film. Supporting cast has some surprises. What's the most impressive thing in this is how Depp channels silent film stars. If you are able to watch the special feature about \\"lighting\\" which sounds boring, watch it anyway. Part way through, Depp is seen rehearsing his Buster Keaton flip and fall, several times in a row. This also happens with the little Charlie Chaplin inspired bread roll dance (Chaplin used potatoes, I think). My appreciation for him went up a couple of notches after watching all that. All in all, it's a wonderful feel-good film but not syrupy sick sweet.

I guess I was trying to figure out what she was trying to say beyond the music. The album is about 10 songs long. I love \\"Me\\" and about two other songs featuring Bilal, who, to me, is one of the greatest and most underrated soul singers of our time.   I'm not sure that I totally understand this album. I don't like most of the songs. I do like the concept, though, and I'm eagerly looking forward to the second part of this album.

B000VI6T6K|5.0|June 18, 1967.<br /><br />On that date, at The Monterey International Pop Festival, the Jimi Hendrix Experience exploded onto the American music scene through an incredible, historic performance.<br /><br />By taking the visual aspect of the art of music to new heights, this was Hendrix setting a course which redefined rock and electric guitar as a lead instrument through the driving force in a power trio.<br /><br />Introduced by the Brian Jones, Hendrix launched the set with a rapid-fire  romp of Howling Wolf's Killing Floor. But it is the ever-changing moods in the numbers - The Wind Cries Mary, Foxey Lady, Rock Me Baby, Like A Rolling Stone - which shows the genius of Hendrix.<br /><br />In 43 minutes, Hendrix began a revolution in sound that still sounds fresh some 40 years later. This is one of a handful of essential live releases and a sonic reminder of the vision of a true artist.

B000TEUSJK|4.0|\\"Little Boots\\" Caligula, masterfully portrayed by Malcolm McDowell (\\"A Clockwork Orange\\"), easily the most degenerate, morally corrupt of all the Ceasars, including the infamous Nero, invites you into his sexually seething, opulently gore-filled palace to witness his uncontolled hubris as he ascends to the \\"throne\\" of what was once the Republic of Rome.    Vicious, paranoid, petulant, flippant, Caligula destroys all boundaries of morality in his unbridled lust to become a god. Peter O'Toole and Sir John Gielgud add dramatic gravity in short but well-crafted roles as roadblocks in the path of monomania.     This film is definitely not for younger viewers nor persons who object to pornography, demonstrating as it does the broadest range of sexual activity one is likely to see in a film intended for the general public.    For all of that, the lavish sexuality of the film is essential to the depiction of scene and theme, and though ever-present, it is only occasionally gratuitous. This film must rate as the finest film ever made to contain pornography, stylistically, contextually, and thematically.     Despite the visuals, or sometimes because of them, \\"Caligula\\" is indisputably a morality play for our time. It is repellant and reassuring, and, ultmately, a near-masterpiece of fine art.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Maybe I cheated, but I stored all episodes of John Adams on my DVR and watched them together Saturday afternoon.The photography,the acting,and the writing were all exceptional. I love to watch both Giamatti and Lineey in anything they do, but this was worthy of their talents. Because of Giamatti's extraordinary acting abilities you can see the complexities of John Adams. Giamatti is brilliant in showing the internal struggle and the effect of outside pressures with/on our 2nd President. I must admit, I had only rudimentary knowledge of John and Abrigal Adams...(you know, History 101). The story line not only kept my interest, but spurred my desire to learn more more these two incredible people.  I was entralled with the portrayal on the events leading to Declaration of Independence and the American Revolution. Needless to say I have pre-ordered this DVD and I went out an bought McCullough's book.   Two thumbs up! (I'd give it 3 thumbs up, but that would be weird.)
1552091090|5.0|I love this book.  I just sent it to a friend who is expecting. Some of the reviews are confusing to me.  The book is not to be taken so literally.

B000YABYLA|2.0|I'm not quite sure what this film is trying to be. A comedy? A drama? A dramedy? Satire? I'm not sure at all what Diablo Cody was thinking when she scripted it. I am sure that the movie's just not as moving, funny, or entertaining as it thinks it is.    The basic premise is that a 16 year old girl accidentally becomes pregnant and she keeps the pregnancy viable so that she can give the newborn to an adoptive couple. It sounds like such an interesting plotline to work with, but it goes wrong in so many ways.     Juno is one of the least believable characters I've seen in any film. Everything she says smacks of forced weirdness which is really the problem with this movie. She shouts \\"Thundercats are go!\\" when going into labor. Would anyone do this in real life?! It's almost like the critics who raved about this movie were thinking \\"Oooo, she mentioned Thundercats and the Stooges and Sonic Youth! I feel good that I actually understand those throwback low-to-high-brow references! Great movie!\\"    Ellen Page rocked the house in \\"Hard Candy\\" but not in this movie. I'm a die-hard Arrested Development fan, but seriously, can't Michael Cera play any other role? Justin Bateman? Baseline creepy in this movie. Jennifer Garner? She's the only genuine character here and the only reason why I liked parts of it. Her portrayal of a woman desperately wanting to be a mother is almost heartbreaking.     Juno reminds me of a few others movies I've seen over the past few years like Gosford Park. These are films that are borderline average but seem to get rave reviews because critics feel like they need to laud them for their supposed wit, heart, originality, etc. Unfortunately, Juno has not much of any of the above.

B000NA2BEU|5.0|Loved this show, wish they hadn't been dumb and cancelled it after 3 seasons.  The show had major potential.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have a vast collection of fitness DVD's I don't utilize as much as I should (call it simple \\"laziness\\" on my part), so initially when I noticed this DVD had come to market I really had no intention of buying it, largely due to the unused DVD's I already own as well as the mixed reviews Jillian's other DVD's had received.  After reading a couple of weeks worth of reviews, though, and reading the positive impact people felt it was having on them I decided to pony up.  I am by no means a large/obese person but out of shape with about twenty to thirty pounds to lose and really figured I could use the motivation.  As I've always been a big fan of \\"The Biggest Loser\\" on t.v. and know how hard-core Jillian can be when it comes to whipping people into shape I thought I should give it a try.  I mean, if 300-pound people can handle it, I would hope I could, too.<br /><br />Thus, I am sitting here having just finished level one circuit and have to admit I am very impressed.  I wasn't sure how I would feel about things like push-ups and jumping jacks, but have to say it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be, particularly given that she dishes them out in very brief intervals.  As I've been in \\"lazy\\" mode and have only been doing 40-minute elliptical workouts over the past few months (i.e. nothing challenging with weights, as I know I should be), it will be interesting to see how my body feels when I wake up tomorrow.<br /><br />So, I am looking forward to doing this DVD several times a week along with continuing my delightful elliptical workouts, and am hoping that this will help propel me to \\"Loser\\" status in no time (okay, if not within the 30-days I'm hoping at least sometime shortly thereafter).  Thanks Jillian, and thanks to all of the other reviewers for sharing their stories and making me a believer!
B00005JO9J|5.0|I luv this show but didnt start watching until like the third season so i ordered the first to fill in the gaps and would definitely recommend it to anyone who's interessted. Grey's Anatomy is about a group of Sergery interns starting out at Seattle Grace Hospital and become friends. The season is only 9 episodes so it doesn't take long to watch them all. Buy it and enjoy!

1594489505|5.0|Khaled Hosseini's A Thousand Splendid Suns is a phenomenal book which is beautifully written as Hosseini captures the attention of his readers from the very moment the novel begins. Any person who is fortunate enough to read A Thousand Splendid Suns will eventually find himself unable to put the book down as the reader cannot help but become immersed in the lives of the fantastic characters within the novel.    Hosseini also uses his skills as a writer to incorporate some of Afghanistan's history into the text of A Thousand Splendid Suns. Therefore, in a sense, he is attempting to tell a story within a story in which the reader is being informed of the many battles the nation of Afghanistan has had to fight over the years.     In addition, Hosseini does a magnificent job in portraying the harsh reality of living in Afghanistan. Hosseini uses his novel as a tool to make his readers aware of the struggle Afghanis, especially Afghani women, have had to overcome just to survive on a daily basis. The reader cannot help but feel a variety of emotions: anger, sadness, compassion, frustration, and sympathy.     As a college student who has a passion for the Middle East, I was in constant awe during my reading of A Thousand Splendid Suns. Hosseini's novel has increased my desire to learn more about the people and the culture of not only Afghanistan, but the entire Middle East. I will most definitely recommend this book to every single person I come across and I look forward to reading Hosseini's other novel, The Kite Runner. I have no doubt that I will once again be pleasantly surprised by Mr. Hosseini's talent.
0143038419|5.0|WOW WOW WOW.  I love this book!! This is just an excellent \\"go to\\" book, when you are needing self-discovery, self-confidence, strength  and just plain feel good fuzzies!  It really helped me to fall in love with life yet again.  I'm a senior grandma, so I'm not in the age category as the author, but that doesn't matter.  She writes so eloquently about LIFE -  LOVE - and taking chances, and letting go, believing in yourself and faith.  You know, as we are going through the days, we sometimes forget to concentrate on the things that really matter.  God, christianity, faith, and not taking anything for granted.  You will love this book like I did.  I saw Elizabeth Gilbert on \\"Oprah\\" and really connected with her that moment.  My dream for years has been to go to Italy.  So she was right up my alley.  But I got so much more from her book than just a travelog.  She was on a mission to discover herself after ending a marriage.  So she made plans to go traveling by herself, and meet up with some friends along the way.  When I finished the book, I wanted her to be MY friend, daughter, granddaughter, ect.  I recommend this book very highly!
0316067601|1.0|They drop poor soldiers into an obtuse confrontation and the purpose of the \\"mission\\" now becomes survival, most of them are too modestly educated to question why they may be there. I thought the elite forces would be able to discriminate between Washington BS and truth. It appears that now, the Seals are just geeked up grunts on Corporate Imperialistic Steroids. What I found in this book is the typical phoney religious patriotic screed of kill whatever Bush tells you too and don't question it. Who is the enemy sir? Wait, i'll tell you in a minute,,,Oh they were are friends yesterday before they sold their Carlye group stocks, now they are the enemy threatening our way of life... KILL THEM!

B0014EVO4M|2.0|Great movie, but somehow the soundtrack leaves out the two most touching (imho, that is) tunes of the film: the songs performed by Tracy. The second one is \\"The Angel Of Montgomery\\" by J. Prine. Have not figured out what the first one was (...ain't no wonder I never have much to say, I am just hanging on the wind...).     Fabulous movie, wish the soundtrack was more than just an E. Vedder solo CD...
0399132635|5.0|\\"Watchers\\" by Dean Koontz is not only a story for people who like great horror sci-fi, but for people who enjoy great narrative literature in the first place.  Dean Koontz was able to construct the story in a well done formula that moves at a smooth pace without faltering.  The characters in the story: ex Delta Force soldier Travis Cornell, the beautiful but sheltered Nora Devon, the smart pup Einstein, NSA agent Lem Johnson, the hitman Vince Nasco, and The Outsider monster were all some of the most lovable and well developed characters that I have ever had the pleasure of reading.  I am not fan of Koontz' work but Watchers has become one of my favorite books. Intertwined with the science fiction story is a human story about a man, a woman, and a dog all seeking to be free from their self conflicts.  They stay together for each other with a love that grows with every moment. It is a story about a creature that wishes it could live as a normal being but cannot resist the rage and brutal nature infused in it's blood.  The Outsider uses its existence to hunt and kill anything while seeking his \\"experimental brother,\\" the gifted pup.  Following the narrative is the hitman who thinks he's becoming immortal with every life he takes and an NSA agent caught between the system and his own personal beliefs.  All I have to say is read this book if you ever get the chance, because you will be transported to a world that is both believable and magical. Trust me even though its about a special dog and a killer monster, it is no excuse for passing up the other possibilities you will find in this enjoyable tale. A wonderful piece of fiction.
B000ZN802W|1.0|I'm sorry. I know I'm in the minority here, but I just have to say that \\"Into the Wild\\" is one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. Sure, the production values, cinematography and acting are first rate. However, that can't make up for the fact that our hero was an idiot.     So he leaves everything behind to go into the wildreness. Woo-hoo. Thoreau lite. However, what he doesn't realise is if beauty is everywhere (as he tells Hal Holbrook), then you don't need to go anywhere to find it. Freakin' MORON!     In any case, if you've got 2 1/2 hours to waste - go bang your head against the wall or anything, ANYTHING but watch this dimwit trudge into the woods and (SPOILER ALERT!) meet his end!

B000055Y12|1.0|I'm a fan of Hitchcock and have seen most of his films. I missed Topaz when it came out, so I borrowed the VHS tape. What a waste of time! This is the worst Hitchcock film I've ever seen and one of the worst films ever.<br /><br />This is nominally a spy thriller, but at every point where suspense is possible, Hitch defuses the thrills. There's way too much talk, and the few action scenes are predictable and flat. The tradecraft is unbelievable: what intelligence officer waits across the street while his operative waves to him and then walks into a hotel filled with Cubans?<br /><br />The actors are wooden and glum, with the exception of Phillipe Noiret, who manages to inject his character with some shades of feeling.<br /><br />It feels like a bad propaganda film, one made by the State Department to warn the Russians that we're serious about the Monroe Doctrine.
0714843377|4.0|The author starts off with the following:<br /><br />\\"Firstly you need to aim beyond what you are capable of.<br /> You must develope a complete disregard for where your abilities end...<br /> Nothing is impossible.\\"<br /><br />The author provides some tips for sales and advertising profession. But most of the tips are of vague and general sort (Don't be Afraid to Work with the Best, Accentuate the Positive, If you can't solve a problem you are playing by the rules, Getting Fired Can be a Positive Career Move).<br /><br />This book, which contains at least one picture (or a drawing) per each page, allows one to think out of the box. I have found the visual approach to inspiration to be quite refreshing.<br /><br />Yes, the book is short. It probably contains less than 3000 words. But, somehow, I came away more satified and motiviated by its message than its wordier counterparts.

B000Z8GZYW|5.0|This movie is probably not for everyone, although I would recommend that most people try it. I think it takes a certain degree of inclination towards patient \\"moral\\" narratives to appreciate it deeply. For instance, those who only watch romantic comedies because they are expecting either gags (such as one could find in, say, \\"What about Bob\\") or linear romance with simple ups and downs (perhaps based on the theme of romantic destiny), those will probably not have the patience for it. Other than that, it is very easy to like. But here is why I, for one, loved it:    The movie presents a fairly sophisticated moral tale about time and fate (not destiny). Phil (Murray) starts as a pretentious, unpleasant, irritable, visibly unhappy and \\"self-absorbed\\" career guy. As the weatherman (nice touch!), he is obviously consumed by the low-level fame conferred upon him by the TV medium. The kind of self-important guy who always acts like he has somewhere more important to be, but never seems to \\"arrive\\" anywhere.    Then one day, due to bad weather, which he failed to predict (!!!), he is stuck in a small town that he despises and could not wait to leave. He entered the town in order to cover an event that he finds eminently absurd: groundhog day. Naturally annoyed, he goes to bed early. But, by a freak occurence of fate, he wakes up the next day to find himself again on groundhog day, unable to leave. And this goes on again and again. The basic point of the story is to show how his character evolves as he is forced to relive the same day again and again.    At first, there is the horror and the insanity, as he becomes aware of his absurd situation: having to live the same stupid day again and again, inexplicably. (The absurd life: a theme made famous by A. Camus.) Then there is the sense of despair. Then there is the realization, with enthusiasm naturally, that if nothing has consequences beyond today, and one can start over tomorrow, then one can get away with anything. (Thisis a theme made famous by Dostoevski). And he does: he drives recklessly, he cheats for sex, he steals money, he eats without moderation. (Some people call this \\"active nihilism.\\") Then there is the delusion of grandeur: he thinks he is a God. But it turns out that the one thing he really wants, he cannot get: that is, to charm his colleague (McDowell), a sucker for poetry who finds him vain. As he begins to find her genuinely interesting, he applies all his new powers to seduce her, refining his approach with new information day after day. But without success. Then, of course, comes the disillusionment. And the bitterness. Then the conviction that all this must end: he attempts suicide in a thousand different ways. Also without success: he keeps on waking up on the morning of groundhog day.     Realizing that he cannot escape his condition (which reminds me of something J.P. Sartre said), he eventually surrenders, and progressively, he begins to accept his fate and develop a deeper interest in his small world. He tries to make himself useful to others. First he becomes obsessed with making an old dying beggar he had always ignored survive. Without success. His day will never be that perfect. But he can still try to make it better. So, he comes to realize that there is an infinity of things he can do to make every day better for everyone, including himself. And this includes refining his aesthetic appreciation and artistic skills: he learns the piano, and ice sculpting. Ironically, while he no longer goes after McDowell's character, he incidentally acquires all the virtues that she would love in a man. So, yes, she falls in love with him. (Reminds me of those eastern philosophies that basically say that you have to know how to let go of your desire for things in order for the desirable things to come to you). They fall asleep side by side: another night after groundhog day, and he is infinitely grateful for it. Finally, precisely when it is no longer expected, something like grace or redemption occurs: the day after groundhog day comes, as he wakes up next to her; the cycle has been broken. (They decide to stay. They live happily ever after...)    I will spare you the religious ramifications. But, clearly, this movie illustrates what we may call \\"existentialism\\" in a more GRATIFYING manner than any Woody Allen movie you will find out there. What is most amazing about \\"Groundhog Day\\" is how both lightly, even unassumingly, and yet impeccably it treats such a sophisticated subject. It even manages to put it to the service of romance, without cynicism. Its narrative progression will seem very \\"logical\\" to those familiar with the philosophical theme. And yet the movie never seems to take itself too seriously. It is pretty ordinary by a number of criteria (no odd narrative devices), and at times really touching. Bill Murray is effortlessly convincing, as usual: he always looks his old natural self when he is funny, and manages to look ill when his character is supposed to be frustrated, or oblivious when his character is supposed to have become resigned.    Of course, you can always find some imperfection with some aspect of the movie. But all in all, it accomplishes what very few movies accomplish: it manages to be, at the same time, effortlessly funny, unpretentiously smart, and surprisingly deep and touching. A very unique story, to be sure.

015603283X|5.0|I read this book a while ago, but it still remains on my list of favorites.  I had already seen the movie \\"The Ninth Gate\\" and didn't know this was the book that movie was based upon until the storyline started to seem vaguely familiar.    Even though I knew the story, I still enjoyed reading the book immensely.  The book is a bit different from the movie and the plot is very cleverly constructed.  It keeps the reader guessing until the end, and the end does not disappoint.

B0011ZNAIC|2.0|Not painful to get through, but didn't offer much in terms of laughs or memorable scenes.  Main character Barry B. Benson was decent, but the \\"cute\\" factor could have been bumped up a few notches.  The weird relationship/emotional affair between Zellweger's character and the bee was a little strange and doesn't resolve itself even at the end of the movie when she continues the dependence on Barry as a friend and intellectual/emotional support instead of fixing things with her distant jock of a husband.  Two and a half stars.

B0013SJ44Q|5.0|*This record is #7 in a select chronological list of 500 albums that never made the top 40 album charts (released 1964-present), yet considered among the best and/or most important albums ever released. \\"An Alternative Top 40\\" is a work in progress, to be published in 2017.<br />During his lifetime, Otis Redding set the benchmark for soul music. He virtually defined the genre, and to this day, his music remains as fresh and vital as it was in the mid-sixties. \\"Otis Blue\\" was Redding's third album release, and the first to provide an unfettered view of his seemingly limitless ability. There is not an ounce of filler on this release, which is why \\"Otis Blue\\" so deserves the attention and privilege of a special \\"collector's edition' release. Here is a track-by-track synopsis of why you need  to own \\"Otis Blue\\"<br />1) \\"Ole Man Trouble\\" is a Redding original that stands among the best recordings he has ever made. Steve Cropper's guitar provides the bricks and mortar for this intense slow burner with blues and country overtones.<br />2) What remains to be said about \\"Respect\\"? Yes, Aretha's interpretation put a powerful spin on the Otis Redding composition, but this version reminds us that the song was originally written from a man's perspective.<br />3) Sam Cooke wrote \\"A Change Is Gonna Come,\\" and his version remains definitive, but Otis' interpretation is easily the most expressive recording of this intensely personal song about equality and civil rights.<br />4) Besides writing his own compositions, Redding had excellent taste when it came to covering other people's material. \\"Down in the Valley\\" is a Solomon Burke tune that Redding interprets with a deep-fried Memphis intensity.<br />5) \\"I've Been Loving You Too Long\\" is the ultimate example of a soulful pleader. Written with Jerry Butler, Redding bends notes and makes the hairs on your arm stand up from his painful vulnerability, only to build up to a level that captures all the pain of a man on the verge of breaking down.<br />6) Otis Redding was obviously a Sam Cooke fan, and easily his best interpreter. With \\"Shake,\\" he surpasses Cooke's own version by allowing the band to groove with a rocking intensity that suits the song's topic.<br />7) Nobody will ever beat the slick city-groove cool of the Temptations original, but Otis takes \\"My Girl\\" to the country, adding a grits-and-soul type honesty.<br />8) \\"Wonderful World\\" is yet another Sam Cooke interpretation that gets the same organic treatment as \\"My Girl.\\"<br />9) Virtually every quality that is attributable to the \\"Stax-Volt' sound is on full display on \\"Rock Me Baby,\\" from the unique interpretation of the song's rhythm to the grooving guitar supporting the hot horn charts, not to mention Otis Redding's down-to-earth vocals.<br />10)  With \\"Satisfaction,\\" Otis Redding single-handedly turned the tables on the British invasion's penchant for interpreting American blues and soul classics. Keith Richards himself says that Redding's performance of his song is the way he intended it to sound in the first place.<br />11)  \\"You Don't Miss Your Water\\" is another sterling example of Otis Redding's taste in cover material. William Bell wrote this song about love and hindsight, and Otis brings an intensity similar to that he displayed on \\"I've Been Loving You Too Long.\\"<br />That covers the album in its original glory. The beauty of the Collector's Edition is that is also includes some stellar bonus material, including a generous sampling of Redding's live recordings in California (at the Whiskey a Go-Go) and excerpts from the classic \\"Live in Europe\\" album. Most welcome are the original non-LP B-sides from Redding's 45-RPM singles, including \\"I'm Depending on You\\" and \\"Any Ole Way.\\" If you love soul, then you need to own \\"Otis Blue.\\" If you don't love soul, then you never heard \\"Otis Blue.\\" A+ Tom Ryanng down.<br />6) Otis Redding was obviously a Sam Cooke fan, and easily his best interpreter.

B000VNMMQG|3.0|This movie romantically dramatizes the Parliamentary efforts of bleeding-heart nabob William Wilberforce to abolish slavery in the British Empire. It is well made liberal hagiography with good production value and some well known actors, but the Manichean simplicity of such agitprop is becoming very tiresome to me as I get older. The slave holders are all evil and the abolitionists are all saints (that's literally what they were known as, which demonstrates the lunatic boundlessness of liberal arrogance). We are even shown Wilberforce taking on the role of \\"alter Christus\\" as he undergoes another Passion through his physical ailments and the stress of his abolitionist crusade. There's just no gray areas in this movie, no deeper questions about an issue that still haunts us to this day.<br /><br />Even if one holds slavery to be a human rights injustice, it's pretty hard for someone to turn that into a sinful offense against the Christian God, as the abolitionists claimed, considering that the Lord Jesus Himself never saw fit to address the issue while He was on earth and His own Scriptures condone the institution in the clearest terms, even going so far as to enjoin slaves to obey their masters. Why then do we still accept the demonization of slave owners that abolitionists engaged in? In the 1750 years or so between the ministry of Christ and the birth of the abolitionist movement, should we not ask why so minuscule a number of Christians, who read the same Bible and worshipped the same God as Wilberforce and his \\"saints\\", came to the same conclusions about slavery as they did? Slavery, after all, was an ancient and venerable tradition in every part of the world, especially Africa, whose role in the Atlantic slave trade goes unacknowledged in this movie. Without the help of the Africans themselves, there would have been no slave trade for Wilberforce to rail against. Instead, this film leads the ignorant to heed the fictional tale of an African \\"prince\\" who was captured by marauding White men. It's a horrible thought, but is it perhaps nature's law that the strong and advanced will ever rule the weak and primitive, that a part of humanity is born with saddles on their back, ready to be ridden by those born booted and spurred? Will slavery be seen again in history, once the relatively brief and artificial interlude of Anglo-American liberalism is overcome by the inexorable forces of nature and its own degenerative qualities? What does it portend when recent news reports quote several Africans, disgusted by the universal failure of their liberated continent, as openly expressing a desire for the return of European colonialism?<br /><br />While Wilberforce had a legitimately charitable heart and may not have been as bad as many of his compatriots, who bewailed the fate of the African slaves, while scorning the cries of five-year-old White children who went to their early graves working 16 hours a day in mines and factories, his sympathies often did not extend to his own people's horrific conditions. He opposed the right of workers to organize for better conditions and pay, and was described by one notable Englishman as someone who \\"who preaches vital Christianity to untutored savages, and tolerates its worst abuses in civilised states\\". Another activist told Wilberforce that \\"Never have you done one single act, in favour of the labourers of this country.\\" Where is the movie about the White serfs of the British Empire, who often lived in worse conditions than slaves? Why are we not incessantly reminded about the White blood that fueled the Industrial Revolution?<br /><br />Another uncomfortable question this movie raises is why American abolitionists had to resort to bloody civil war to free the slaves, when Great Britain achieved the same goal legally and peacefully with financial compensation for slave owners. Slavery would have withered and died within a few decades even had there not been a Civil War. Without favoring slavery, perhaps our northern abolitionists should be cursed as Jacobin fanatics who sacrificed 600,000 Americans on the altar of their revolutionary mania.<br /><br />Another unexamined issue in this movie is the fate of the liberated. In order to prove the equality of Africans, Wilberforce and his people set up the free colony of Sierra Leone, which was populated by starry-eyed Whites and freed blacks, and liberally funded by wealthy friends. Wikipedia says \\"The dream was of an ideal society in which races would mix on equal terms; the reality was fraught with tension, crop failures, disease, death, war and defections to the slave trade.\\" Today, Sierra Leone \\"is the lowest ranked country on the Human Development Index and seventh lowest on the Human Poverty Index, suffering from endemic corruption, suppression of the press and the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\\" (also from wikipedia). The history of every single other black society on earth reflects the same attributes. This movie makes it seem like the Africans' troubles were over once some White men passed a bill in London. Wilberforce's abolition bill was indeed significant, but by no means got to the root of the problem, and in most ways it seems like African quality of life has only declined since the 19th century.<br /><br />I'm not defending slavery and I do think Wilberforce accomplished a good thing with the abolition of slavery. I just think the issue isn't as cut and dried as Hollywood History for Dummies would lead us to believe.abolitionists should be cursed as Jacobin fanatics who sacrificed 600,000 Americans on the altar of their revolutionary mania.

B000ICLRIE|4.0|the blu-ray format is an amazing thing...and films which were created in high-definition really stand out...this film is the director's cut...so it has about 15-18 minutes more than the theatrical release...the clarity of the images is stunning...the sound quality is startlingly clear...a very strong addition to your blu-ray library...it is rated r for good reason, however...
0385333846|3.0|It is not my usual stuff but it had some interesting ideas. I have to admit though that I checked out the Spark Notes just to make sure I was keeping up with everything. The \\"getting unstuck\\" and traveling back and forth through time was a bit nerve racking but in the end, I understood why he did it. At least I think I do. Either Vonnegut is a literary genius or a complete fool. Judging from his popularity though I am going to say that it is the former. If not, we are all the latter.
B000UCEJEQ|4.0|this is awesome blues-funk-soul annie creativity in full effect!!! it shows she rocks with the best of them and her soulfull voice is an absolute gemstone...
B0000CABJ1|5.0|We LOVE this cd! My wife purchased it for us. It has all of Donna Summers best songs and then a few surprises. Some songs that we never knew she recorded. GREAT beat and an added bonus disc of remixes.We put it on our mp3 players. Great for the gym and the car. Must buy this if you love Donna Summers or 70's disco.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|it is easy to see why this blu-ray set is among the most popular of all things sold...the footage is awesome, it is a breath-taking journey around the globe, and a fascinating archive of natural phenomena and wildlife...be absolutely sure to put this in your blu-ray libray...what stunning footage---you really feel like you have an awesome index of the natural and animal beauty of the world!!!
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|Cloverfield is a good, albeit not very good, monster movie.  As far as monster movies go you don't have to try hard to be better than most but that still doesn't make it a great movie.      I'm tired of the shaky cam.  In the hands of a good filmmaker, when used in moderation, it can be blended into the flow of the film in such a way that it adds just the needed tension, edge, whatever, into the events on screen.  But when used like this (and Blair Witch, Bourne Supremacy and Bourne Ultimatum, etc. etc.) it is just a cheap gimmick.  I understand what the filmmaker wanted to do, and I think it was an interesting and ambitious idea, but that doesn't mean it will translate into great film.  If you can't watch the film or, worse, you can't make out what is happening in the film, then it is hard to enjoy the movie.    In addition, the fact that it was filmed in the \\"first person\\" angle you don't get the moments you would normally expect in a film where the filmmaker is tying everything together, resolving questions, working out the kinks and correcting inconsistencies, you are just left with the bits and pieces that you have available.  This led to only one type of plausible ending and it was far from satisfying for me.    While I'm also griping I'll throw out the type of monsters used in these movies.  How is it that they can be so invincible? Mankind can level cities with ease but we can't seem to hurt a giant bug? And the little monsters the parent spawned were hilarious - though I doubt that was intentional.    Still, I gave the movie a middle-of-the-road score because despite not being that good of a movie it is still fun to watch the first time through and there really aren't that many great monster flicks to choose from.  If you can stomach the shaky cam and suspend your belief for an hour and a half then Cloverfield is still worth the watch.    Lasting impression - it was a like a made for SciFi Channel movie with worse camera work.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|this is listed on the blu-ray.com website as one of the most favorite of all films among blu-ray owners, and it is easy to see why...this animation and color...just eye-popping...you HAVE to have this in your library...it is a must!!! what until you watch!!!
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|oh,man!i totally get it.it's a day pretty much like any other day.actually a very  good day.we're having a party!rob is moving to japan to start a new job.how very  exciting.there are beautiful girls(lily is megagorgeous!)and all are good friends  and lovers.suddenly things go terribly wrong in the city.a huge monster is on the   loose and wrecking havoc everywhere.the destruction and carnage is on a 9/11 scale.  and is it is all being recorded on video.very realistic in its approach.so what if  it is not done in the traditional hollywood formula.it is entertainment.it is not  real.darned good entertainment at that.can't wait for the sequel.there is going to  be a sequel?of course,it may not be done in the same first person perspective type  filming.unless they find more video of the event in the wreckage and ruin of the once great metropolis of new york.in order to save the city,it had to be destroyed.  however,i do believe that godzilla would take good care of ol' mr/ms cloverfield  monster.after all,how ya gonna stop a 300 feet tall,radioactive breath monster?  if done respectfully,godzilla vs cloverfield would be big!big box office,too.are  you listening hollywood?or tokyo?
B0002F6AH0|5.0|This was how I learnt about the second world war, this series didn't romantisize the era as many movies and docos did (and still do) As this series was made in the early seventies many of the survivors were still alive to account for the events first hand. It is heavy viewing yet so well written and presented that I don't think this series will ever be obsolete.

If you have a lazy and/or procrastinating streak, read this book!
B000XA5K48|5.0|This movie had SO many cool action/shoot out scenes.  Clive Owen stars as a man who knows how to shoot and make the best use of a carrot.  He's a scruffy, ( but very handsome ) man who innocently stumbles upon a woman about to give birth.  Some bad guys start shooting at the woman and he assists in birthing her child, all the while blowing away said bad guys.  He protects the child from a really nasty head scumbag -playing against his usual, amiable and likable character type, by Paul Giamatti- and the body count climbs higher and higher. Clive enlists the help of a lactating prostitute ( the baby does need to eat ), and eventually a high ranking government/business consipracy is revealed.  Lots of action, blood and great one-liners/puns.  Oh, and the carrot bit.....you can pretty much take a stab at what Clive uses it for....
055358894X|4.0|The hero of this tale, one Locke Lamora, could easily be recognized as a new world Oliver Twist with his urchin-like characteristics; badly done by, his upbringing and his training as a thief carried out by an updated Fagin. But the writer- whose prose I much admired- carries his hero much further than that into an adult world where only the strongest and most devious survive; where a dog eat dog mentality is imbued into most of the residents of Camorr, excepting those born into privilege.<br />The story sweeps one along at a rollicking pace and the denouement is carried out well except I personally would have liked a more liberal use of the 'F' word. Overall an enjoyable romp from an author destined to go places.
B000R7I3LY|2.0|I was disappointed in this cd. She swears more than I would like. I also didn't like that the version of bottle it up was the album version and not the acoustic/ remix version. I didn't realize there was a different version of it until I got the cd. :(
B00132D808|1.0|Panic at the Disco's first release was nothing short of brilliant!  It was an awe-inspiring combination of Punk, Rock, and Techno-esque riffs that was not only unique, but a great listen that kept you wanting to hear more and more as well.  Unfortunately, Pretty. Odd. is  frankly an utter disappointment.  With additional Orchestra instruments and the lack of raw chords and vocals, Panic has lost their edge to say the least.  They have also almost switched genres and now sound more like the later days of Oasis than the rigid band we all know and love.  In short, do not buy this album because you will be 100% disappointed; if enough of you heed my warning, hopefully Panic will get the message, hit the studios asap and put out a follow-up album truly worth to be the sequel to their Freshman release.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|I forgot this movie....it is real tame compared to todays special effects....it's good to see Steve again though

B000PHX4VA|1.0|2 CD's....only 20 songs? And the 20 most obvious songs to boot. Where's the beef?!?!?! What a waste of money. The Police are a 5 Star band and deserve better than this meer sampler product. If all you want are the hits, this is for you. If you want The Police, spend your $$ on one of their original CD's. The CD reeks of a record company wanting to make a few more bucks off of the unsuspecting.
0743297334|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter who has evinced an interest in Hemingway. The backstory of this novel is interesting. The people in the novel, except for Jake, are all real people and friends of Hemingway. The story of the trip to the bullfights in Spain was true and one of many that Hemingway and his friends made in 1920s Spain. It takes place in a few days and this was the first big novel that made him famous. Prior to this, he was known as a short story writer. One character, Robert Cohn, was a friend who was quite angry at his role in the fictionalized version of the trip. He thought Hemingway had made him look like a fool and he threatened to kill Hemingway, a famous brawler among his friends. There was a small bar in Paris, across the street from the Cafe de la Paix, where they all used to hang out. It is no longer there but was on my first trip to Paris. Hemingway spent several days waiting for this disgruntled friend to come in the bar so he could try to defuse the anger before something serious happened. Finally, after about a week, the friend walked in and Earnest jumped up, ran over to him and shook his hand, greeting him as an old friend. The ploy worked and the feud was over. This is a classic and the first of his novels.
0140366822|5.0|I grew up with Walt Disney's story of Pollyanna. I still have the LP record album of the movie soundtrack. But I was pleasantly surprised to read the original story and find such depth of character and meaning. I highly recommend this delightful book.
B000ICM5VW|5.0|This remake of the 1933 classic film surpasses in many ways. First, the excellent direction by Peter Jackson and the script and also the stars Naomi Watts & Jack Black. Jackson has re-imagined the film with its references to \\"Heart of Darkness\\" while paying homage to the earlier film by bringing the setting back to the Depression. Also Watts has never been more sympathetic than in this film and Jack Black is a comic delight as the con man/director Denham. As for Adrian Brody, he was okay but did not stand out as much as Watts or Black. I have this in HD-DVD and it is definitely reference quality so until Universal makes the switch to Blu-ray in their selections, you can get this film at a premium price in HD (as low as $10).  The jungle scenes plus the finale in NYC are phenomenal in HD!! Recommended for all Kong enthusiasts and lovers of fantasy!! By the way, this disc has gone as low as $3 or $4 in HD DVD compared to the $20 or more that you'd have to pay to get it in Blu-ray---and there is barely any difference between the 2 Hi-Def formats--so consider!!  To update things a bit, this HD DVD can be had at the ridiculously low price of .73 cents!!  My only regret is that they could've had the extended version of this remake on HD DVD whereas the Blu-ray does have both--guess I'll rent the Blu-ray to check out the extended scenes.
B000VECAC6|5.0|If you've ever seen a Monty Python and like then but haven't seen Life of Brian you will love this as it is one of their best.    If you're not a Monty Python I encourage you to go pick up Life of Brian as well as Monty Python and the Holy Grail immediately if not sooner.      If you don't like Monty Python there is a small chance you will like this, but really... why watch one more movie to find out how much you lack a sense of humor. ;)    The reshot Blu-Ray edition is great.  Everything is so clean and crisp without destroying the gritty comedy of the show.
B000XPU5NY|5.0|Hey all,   I think this album is really great for the people who didn't see Genesis in 2007. It is definitely worth the money. If you are a die-hard fan this is a must.    Thanks
B000ZK4466|2.0|The music for this album is as great as the rest of TMV's work. Sadly, the loudness war has claimed this album as one of its greatest triumphs. The mixing is so horrendous on a few of the tracks that it hurts to listen to them.  Save your ears. Buy the vinyl and rip your own tracks.

0810993139|5.0|By: Brian K.   Let me got something straight: This book is a JOURNAL, not a diary.   Greg Heffley is a middle school student trying to be popular, rich, stay best friends with Rowley, not get the cheese touch, and have fun.   With Greg and Rowley you learn about what it would be like to be a nothing in middle school even when you try hard.  Like one time he thought it would be cool to chase kindergarteners around with a worm on a stick, only to get caught and blame it on Rowley. Now he's kicked off the only cool thing he's in, the safety patrol squad, and he lost his best friend.   This book is so funny and grabbing.  It's like being strapped to a T.V. with Americas Home Funniest Videos on. The author made me feel like I was one of Greg's friends, right next to him all the way through this book. When I finished, I felt like it was summer break waiting for the next school year and the next book DIARY OF A WIMPY KID: RODRICK RULES.   This amazing novel is full with friendship, betrayal, and bullying. I would recommend it to people who like visual drawings, hilarious dialog, and a cool journal pace.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|5FDP is the best metal/rock band ever. The music gets your attention right away (double bases) and when the vocals come in they take control of you and you start rockin'.

0142405787|5.0|Scorpia by Anthony Horowitz.   Alex Rider is devastated when he learns that his dad did not die in a plane crash and his uncle was murdered in a secret agent mission. He has to find the truth about his family. He has the opportunity to go to Venice with Tom his best friend he jumps at it. In Venice he finds Scorpia and Miss Rothman who is one of the leaders of Scorpia. Miss Rothman has a plan called Invisible Sword that will kill many people. Alex betrays MI6, which he risked his life for 3 times before, and joins Scorpia as a contract killer. Alex must find out more about his father and about someone's past that might change his life forever.       I loved this book because it had a suspenseful, dramatic ending that made me think that the last page was missing. Scorpia is a great book about betrayal with complex plot and realistic dialog. I felt like I was right next to Alex in every scene. My favorite part was when Alex was going to drown under Venice's sewers to get away from Nile and Miss Rothmen. I would recommend this book to anyone that would like a powerful suspenseful storyline with a heart-racing ending.      By Sonny P
B000063UR2|4.0|It has been a while since I have seen this movie.  It was great to see it the original version and then the directors cut.  Overall it is awesome and came in good shape. Thanks.
014240165X|5.0|Stormbreaker                                                  Anthony Horwitz    Alex Rider was an average kid. Just another British kid that lives with his uncle.  But when his uncle dies in a car crash because he wasn't wearing a seat belt, Alex becomes suspicious. After school Alex went to the junkyard and found his uncles car in tact but when he walks around to the drivers side door he sees a spray of bullet holes in the door.   I love this book and I my self am a VERY picky reader and I have read all the books in the series: stormbreaker, Point Blanc, Skeleton Key, Eagle Strike, Scourpia, Ark Angle, and Snake head. It is action pact book with so many amazing I thought I was in the movie theater. I Stayed up to 1:00AM and didn't even realize it this book was so amazing. I highly recommend this to anyone who has read the cherub series, has seen and loved the James bond movies, or just loves super spy books.  By: Richie S.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|I absolutely loved this film!  Some of the reviews I had read before seeing this film made me think it might be a rather tedious, pointless affair from start to finish.  However, it was nothing like that.  I was transfixed from beginning to end, and when it was all done I found myself delighted.  Once again, David Lynch has outdone himself, and for anyone who claims to love his earlier films, I would be very surprised if you didn't enjoy this one.  Highly highly recommended!
0684865130|5.0|Catch 22 is simply one of the best books ever written.  It describes the world as it really is, and does it in a way that will stick with you for a very long time.  You will have fun with the many characters and find them surrounding you in a very real sense in your day to day life.  Even the dark tragedy of war becomes bearable as described through the comedic voice of the author.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|A great cast, beautifully filmed, and a wonderfully off-beat and original story.  There are just not enough movies like this being made, in an industry that seems to mostly crank out sequels to American Pie.
B0009MAP90|5.0|Just bought the remastered 'Bob Dylan'. Really great, one of the best from the beginning and it sounds amazing! There are so many good songs on it and Dylan's voice is so strong... It's a crime to say he couldn't sing, some people just don't get it. Me I'm totally pleased and riding along.
B00154GEFU|5.0|To all die hard Asia fans, I highly recommend their newest and long awaited album.  It is as good as the first album back in 1982.  And, if you are lucky enough to see them on tour, it is well worth it.  They are just as great as they were 26 years ago.  Buy and Enjoy!!!!
0375703764|5.0|This is a great book. One of the best things about this book is that you won't find others like it. The style is eclectic and draws you in from the beginning. Not only that you will learn a lot about an assortment of subjects (i.e. mazes, echos,...) Plus the description of the \\"film\\" in the book is very interesting and will leave you wanting to know more.  It is a good book for those that don't mind non-sequitors and unconventional storytelling.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|This movie is sometimes really annoying.  If the creature was easily identified(i.e. Godzilla), this movie would have rocked!!!  Sadly,  it's some reject from a really bad B-movie.  Damn!!! So much potential thrown away....
B000WZAE1I|5.0|So I watched this movie in theaters with my friends when it came out...it looked like a lame movie. Therefore, I was quite surprised as the movie wore on, that I loved it! It is hilarious, naughty, and suspenseful all at the same time. I have to be honest...it is a little bit predictable, but there was one thing I was no expecting, which I will not divulge because it will give it away! My only complaint is the appearance and disappearance of the unicorn...they could have done so much with it, but noooo...it had to go away. Where di it come from, anyway? Oh well, that was the only thing. Enjoy this movie!
B0002PZVH0|5.0|I am an acupuncturist and I am always looking for mellow ambient music to play for people in the treatment rooms.  This one is great.

B00006RAKP|5.0|Every great Elton John song from the 'glory years' is right here in this CD.  A while back it occured to me that pop music had undergone a subtle yet very real change, and to me it wasn't for the better.  In fact, today, you will find bands re-recording these classics with their own type of imprint and if you are like me, you cringe.  Seems they are running out of talent.    Almost every Elton John song is a classic.  From the better known \\"Daniel\\" or \\"Rocket Man\\" to the lesser known but still great \\"Sad Songs\\", they are all filled with depth and style.  Elton John's music is signature-by that I mean you know immediately when you hear even the instrumental parts before he actually sings, that this is one of his songs.    I came of age listening to these classics.  It was great to find them all in one CD and to sit back and reminisce about the time that AM was real and music was truly music.  This is a collection you will enjoy for years to come.
1596009330|5.0|Michael Page reads this great classic like a full cast of different actors. Treasure Island deserves its rank as a classic in every sense of the word. It is an extremely well-written book with both intriguing characters and a truly adventurous plot. Listening to this rendition is just plain fun!
B0010X745K|5.0|I thought that this movie was a lot of fun! There was the usual mayhem that arises very quickly when people are trapped in one place together, within a day or two in books and movies they start acting crazy and give aliens and monsters reasons to mock us, for trying to end our lives when things go wrong or there is no way out. Well this was no exception, when a small Maine town ( hey it's a King story, of course it's in Maine) gets enveloped in a thick, cloying mist, those fortunate enough who have escaped early can wave goodbye to their friends and family members because something strange is happening and the chances of any survivors are glum.     When David Drayton and his son make a quick trip to the supermarket for supplies after an electrical storm, they have no idea that the store will be their salvation and damnation at the same time. Once the store door closes and the fog closes in, screams in the distance tell everyone that this is no ordinary case of bad weather, not only is it mysterious but it houses creepy creatures that honestly scared and shocked me. The first time David encounters the blood hungry things in the mist is an unforgettable experience, paranoia adds another layer of terror as people who don't believe him need to see it for themselves and that is the beginning of the end. This horror flick was a lot of fun but also kept me in great suspense for almost the entire time, a little draining but worth it except I don't recommend getting too attached to any characters....some of them didn't last very long, and the ways their last moments ended were truly excruciating.    The movie was pretty fast paced; the acting realistic enough and the creatures were not all CG, so that was refreshing. Highly recommended for lovers of suspense and terror and of course banging endings, this one was shocking and quite honestly very raw, almost painful in a strange way when no amount of relief the ending brought could erase the events that perspired before the last minutes.    - Kasia S.
B0013FBS20|3.0|So I Am Legend is a movie based on the book by Richard Matheson but the story is no where near as close. The Blu-ray contains two versions of the film, the original and the alternate ending. The alternate is a must see for fans of the book because it actually comes a lot closer to what Matheson was going for and the point he tried to get across.  I Am Legend is a very good action/suspense movie that is not afraid to switch from very emotional scenes to ones of intense action. The blu ray version looks amazing and the run down streets and buildings serve as a very powerful image with lots of detail as nature looks to take it all back. Extras include a well done documentary on viruses as well as several different comic stories that are interesting.  Story: 3/5 Sound: 4/5 Picture: 5/5 Extras: 4/5 Overall: 3/5  If you like action and suspense, I Am Legend does a good job of blending them together. If you like the movie, read the book, it actually has a better story that really gets you thinking
B0013FDM7E|4.0|Usually I will read the book first but in this case seeing the trailer being played over and over stimulated my curiosity to the point of no return. Being a New Yorker made the whole experience really fun and interesting; recognizing sights I pass on my way to work every day with an eerie feeling of abandonment was something totally different. I would often think in my head about how crowded it gets and how I wish people would just go away but seeing it all empty and overgrowing with grass like a wild safari was worse than I could have imagined. I guess its better the way it is than suffering eternity alone the same way Robert Neville has.    Alone except for the companionship of Samantha, the loyal German Shepherd, Neville is hunting wild deer and gathering food growing amok through the city while punctually seeking shelter as soon as the day light ends. When darkness approaches so do the mutated bodies that were once human but now reduced to vampire like creatures who savagely will hunt and devour any living creature. His only mission left is finding the cure than can turn the beasts back into the living before he goes mad form being alone. Things start going wrong when Neville stops being the hunter and starts becoming the hunted, the dark alleys that look ominous contain something that is keen ob bringing him down. His daily routing gets disturbed and he can no longer live peacefully with the hopes of one day saving everyone, he needs to find the cure fast or he too will succumb to the dire fate that all others have met.    Visually stunning the movies makes you care for Neville, who was very well portrayed by Smith. He was alone but not overly distressed or crazed, he exercised, rented videos, cooked, watched Shrek and tried to stay as close to being sane as possible. The scary parts made me jump and yell at the TV the same way guys do when they watch sports but overall it was a fun and wild experience and it really made me want to read the book to see what the original idea for this story was. I wish there was less CG effects these days but so many movies are full of them that one can't not see them for just this one reason. Other than that this was a real blast and I will want to see it again soon.      - Kasia S.
B000286RKW|3.0|Following the progress of gangster Ray Liotta and his relationship with mentors Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, Goodfellas is the kind of film you'll either think is a masterpiece or wonder what all the fuss was about. Performances are all outstanding, Scorsese's direction energetic and innovative, but somewhere around the halfway point you may wonder where it's going and come to the conclusion that great performances and grandstanding direction is all its about. There's no shortage of outstanding scenes but the film becomes increasingly repetitive as it underlines and escalates its variations on a theme until it feels like it's all style with nothing more underneath than a two-and-a-half hour episode of Lifestyles of the Rich and Infamous.     Good extras on the two-disc version, but it's hard to buy into all the hype for the film.

B000UJCALI|3.0|At times Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining feels like Home Alone with jokes (Macauley Culkin's &#34;Oh no!&#34; expression even originates in young Danny Lloyd's reaction to seeing the caretaker's twins), with Jack Nicholson doing the screen's most prolonged Bruce Dern impersonation while a helpless little boy outthinks him and lures him to his own destruction. Nicholson's constant clowning certainly does the film few favors and makes Jack Torrence more standup comedian than fearsome killer, setting the scene for three decades of comedy improv slashers. Many of the film's most effective moments, such as the conversation with the dead caretaker in the men's' room or the conversations with Joseph Turkel's ghostly barman, tend to work in spite of the star's grandstanding rather than because of it. He's at his best in the early scenes or his the genuinely unnerving moment where the sleep deprived Torrence unemotionally and less than reassuringly promises his son he'd never hurt him, but by the time he's broken out the fire axe all that's missing is the hockey mask and the striped sweater. It doesn't help that child actor Danny Lloyd isn't terribly good either (his croaking &#34;redrum&#34; scene makes you glad Warners turned down Kubrick's offer to direct The Exorcist), but he isn't quite disastrous either.<br /><br />Yet the film still manages to hold the attention, even if it is often more of a display of technique and Kubrick's visual precision and fascination with the possibilities of the constantly prowling Steadicam rather than a visceral rollercoaster ride: the polite and accommodating Joseph Turkel is easily one of the most memorable spectres in screen history while the ever so formal Philip Stone as the late caretaker with distinct ideas on disciplining children is an almost equally intriguing creation. And with the novel's original ending that saw the various animals carved out of the maze's hedges coming to life impractical with the special effects ofthe day, Kubrick's solution is very satisfying even if he does steal one shot wholesale from The Last Hunt. One striking thing about two of the Overlook's permanent residents, however: if the place does still contain echoes of all the bad things that have happened there over the years, that must mean that one particular guest must have got the worst oral sex of all time from the guy in the Pluto costume!<br /><br />Although still cut by three minutes after its premiere, the 146-minute American cut on the Region 1 NTSC DVD works better than the European version that Kubrick himself cut down to two hours. While many of the cuts are pure exposition, with much of the initial tour around the Overlook and all of Anne Jackson's part hitting the cutting room floor, as did part of one of Turkel's scenes, the longer first half of the film means it takes longer for Nicholson to go whacko (in the European version they've barely had time to unpack before he starts slicing up the ham in extra-thick slices). Unfortunately the stereo remix on the DVD tends to dull some of the film's best sound effects, such as the memorable sound of Danny's tricycle as it passes over carpet onto hardwood floor, and the new letterboxed transfer loses detail from the previous fullframe version that Kubrick approved (the overhead shot of the maze in particular).
1857987489|3.0|\\"Pushing Ice\\" was my first Reynold's book. After reading it and loving it, I decided to give his first novel a try. Reynold's wonderful creativity in plotline, twists, technology, use of science, and characterization are as evident in this first book as they are in his later book.<br /><br />His skill telling that story, however, was not as developed in this novel. I am glad that he has improved, and I look forward to reading the rest of his novels - I hope that there is constant improvement in those, as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the brilliance of this story is often lost, especially in the first 80% of the book. The storyline constantly jumps around without explanation, terms are used that have no definition offered (not even contextually), and - seemed to me, anyway - there's a bunch of just plain-old inconsistency. I found myself many times re-reading sections, sometimes multiple times, just to figure out what is going on.<br /><br />While I appreciate, even prefer, a novelist who makes us work at it a little bit (like Asimov, Herbert, Clarke, and so forth), this one required too much work. If I hadn't been on vacation when reading it, and it hadn't been raining a lot, and this wasn't the only science fiction novel I had with me, and I hadn't so loved his \\"Pushing Ice\\" and willing to give a first novel a lot more forgiveness, I would have given up.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't give up, though. About 80% of the way in, the story and the characters all come together, and the novel turns into a marvelously compelling story of deceit, doublecrossing, and danger, with twists and turn in plot and a lot of brilliantly included and wonderfully creative scientific solutions to problems. A couple of the characters even start be sort of likeable. Other reviewers find it as a negative that the characters are not perfectly good or perfectly evil, but I find that a positive in story-telling. This particular collection of characters goes beyond being real-to-life grey area people, but they're all also rather selfish and self-focused in a dog-eat-dog world where no one really has friends that can be trusted; but a few do learn to trust, and prove to be trustworthy, at least to an extent.<br /><br />I very enjoyed the surprises that come with a group of characters who are, ostensibly, all working as a team as the crew of a ship (and a number of characters in other places that later end up on the ship), but who are also always working for their best interests. Almost like one of those reality cooking shows, where they have to cooperate to make things work, but they all want to win, too.<br /><br />With better editing and more clear writing, this could have been five stars - the story itself certainly is. The book only falls short in confusing presentation.ather selfish and self-focused in a dog-eat-dog world where no one really has friends that can be trusted; but a few do learn to trust, and prove to be trustworthy, at least to an extent.

B00005LC4B|1.0|Simple question: who is the better director, Martin Scorsese or J. Lee Thompson? The answer might seem glaringly obvious, but Scorsese's often outright embarrassingly overwrought remake of Cape Fear showed that when it came to genre pictures, Scorsese wasn't even a runner up.     Where Thompson delivered a good pulp thriller that knew how to do its job and did it well, Scorsese delivered an hyperactive exercise in over the top camerawork, crude editing, and, in Robert De Niro's laughably comic cuts loon, horribly overindulged performances. But his performance is just indicative of the constant overkill that Scorsese brings to the picture. Why have the villain merely sodomise a woman as he did in the original when he can bite her cheek off as well? Why have him settle for love and hate on his knuckles when you can cover his body in \\"Look, I'm a psycho who's read the violent bits in the Bible too many times\\" tattoos? And why not add pinups of Stalin and the odd mass-murderer in his cell just to underline it that bit more? Why kill only one supporting character when you can kill two and cover the floor with their blood? Why save the florid camerawork for the big dramatic scenes where it will have more impact when you can make every minor shot look like a crashing climax to a grand opera? Why not signpost his intentions for the underage daughter in virtual 40-foot high neon letters by having him try to seduce her in grandma's fairytale cottage on the school stage just in case we don't get all the Big Bad Wolf references?     Wesley Strick's screenplay does a good job of updating the tale of Nick Nolte's lawyer and his dysfunctional family being stalked by the former client he did less than his best to keep out of jail for the Fatal Attraction era, and with another, more commercially savvy director this could have worked well as a genre film (it was originally intended as a Spielberg picture) but Scorsese has no idea how to build suspense or atmosphere as he crashes through the material like a bull elephant on speed in a china shop. Yet even his misguided directorial flourishes pale into insignificance next to De Niro's horribly misjudged performance as the vengeful bogeyman, inspired more by Robert Mitchum's character in Night of the Hunter than the one he played in the original film. Where Mitchum merely had to look at Gregory Peck's underage daughter to exude menace in the original, De Niro throws in an absurd Deep Frahyed Sowvan acsunt and a series of ridiculous mannerisms and outrageous facial gurning that even Robert Newton's Long John Silver at his most inebriated might have thought too much, turning his character into more of a cartoon clown than his Fearless Leader in Rocky and Bullwinkle. While with his subsequent semi-comatose performances there's some novelty value in seeing him go all-out, there's no threat or tension from his indestructible killer, no matter how much the film amps up the violence from the original (which had censorship problems of its own back in 1962).     Jessica Lange seems at times to think she's in a school production of a Tennessee Williams play (you almost expect her to say \\"Ah hayve always relahed on tha psychosis of strayngahs\\") and delivers much of her dialogue as if it were a breathing exercise, but Nolte and Juliette Lewis fare better, though it's Joe Don Baker who steals what little there is in the film worth stealing by being one of the few in the cast to rein his performance in. The cameos from original stars Robert Mitchum (cashing the check with consummate disinterested professionalism), Gregory Peck (perhaps making his reluctance to appear known through his over-the-top turn as an outraged old school Gentleman of tha Sowth lawyer) and Martin Balsam (wasted in a nothing part as a judge) only serve to remind you how much better the 1962 version was. Neither thrilling nor bad movie fun, this just gets increasingly tiresome. Still, you have to give them marks for having the chutzpah to tip the audience off that De Niro's character is insane by showing him laughing at Problem Child, and, it has to be said, were it not for this movie we'd probably never have had one of the funniest episodes of The Simpsons ever, Cape Feare - or the excellent DVD extras package for the first film.

B00005RYL2|2.0|Highlander is one of those good ideas that never works because of disastrous directorial miscasting. Attention-seeking video director Russell Mulcahy seems almost perversely determined to make the wrong choice in almost every scene, whether its his obsessive use of inappropriate long lenses or his determination to make every shot so distinctive that he never notices that not only do the pictures often play against the intent of the scene but half the time the shots don't even match. He's not much good with actors either, constantly spinning off into clumsy broad comedy that undermines any threat or momentum, with Clancy Brown's evil Kurgan the main casualty as he is reduced to a tiresomely comical punk rocker. It may be the best of the series, but it's a long way from being even nearly as good as it could and should have been. One film that's practically crying out for a remake with a decent director.

0783227434|3.0|Having abandoned genuine scares in favor of all-out slapstick, Army of Darkness, the third entry in the Evil Dead series sees Bruce Campbell lost in time, low on gas, surrounded by evil and facing the Medieval Dead with only a chainsaw, a '73 Oldsmobile, his trusty boomstick and a lot of attitude in a film that owes more to Ray Harryhausen than George A. Romero, albeit with an R-rating (it's one of the last films to use stop-motion extensively, with more sword-wielding skeletons than Harryhausen managed in his entire career). Never quite as much fun as you'd like it to be, it's certainly aged much better than expected - initially regarded as a disappointment, today it stands up rather well, especially when seen away from its two more small-scale predecessors. Joe LoDuca's unapologetically old-fashioned epic score is a lot of fun too, particularly cues like `Manly Men' and `Building the Deathmobile.'     There's no shortage of different editions of the film on DVD, and the fact that Amazon have lumped all the reviews for them in one big identical heap that appears on every editions page doesn't help sort them out. Seeing the two versions of the film side by side on Anchor Bay's 2-disc DVD (issued as the Special Edition and the Boomstick edition) - the US theatrical version with the S-Mart ending and the longer director's `Bootleg cut' with the original `Planet of the Apes' ending, the differences in the longer version are mainly extended scenes rather than deleted ones, though the use of a few alternate takes means that some of the most quotable lines from the shorter version are lost (\\"Good, bad, I'm the one with the gun.\\" \\"Maybe my men can hold them. Maybe I'm a Chinese jet pilot.\\" \\"Hail to the king, baby.\\") and the picture quality is a lot softer. It has to be said that both versions have their merits: there's a bit of repetition in the long version (Marcus Gilbert's every other line in the last half hour seems to be \\"We are deserted!\\") and while a lot of good stuff was lost when the film was trimmed for the US, the shorter version IS a lot snappier and the S-Mart Dedite ending is quite fun even if it doesn't set up the will-it-ever-get-made Evil Dead 4 promised in the original ending.

B000M5AJQS|2.0|First time round I found The Departed a disappointingly average film, but on a second viewing it's clear I misjudged it: it really is a quite bad one. Scorsese's weaknesses as a storyteller have often been discussed, but he's not helped here by a remarkably poor and horrendously overpopulated script from the usually much more interesting William Monahan that at once dumbs down the original Infernal Affairs and simultaneously overcomplicates the storytelling. For all the additional characters and running time there's no grander design at work here to compensate. It may strain for grand opera but it simply comes across as off-key light operetta sung by people with sore throats.     The chief problem is the film's funereal pacing, which the clumsy editing and energetic camerawork increasingly fail to hide. The film takes forever to set up its plot - the film is half over before Matt Damon's undercover mobster who has worked his way into a Boston police task force is ordered to find himself - but never compensates by fleshing out the characters or adding any substance to the story. If anything, underneath all the bloat and bombast the film has seriously dumbed down the Infernal Affairs trilogy's underlying themes of identity, role playing and the need to find some kind of redemption in a world that requires you to be corrupt in order to live with yourself in some kind of peace. Instead, it's become a star vehicle in the worst sense of the phrase, where the central duo of police mole in the underworld and underworld mole in the police are effectively sidelined for so much of the picture that they almost become bit players.     Yet while we get seemingly endless and often incredibly long scenes of Jack Nicholson grandstanding, doing rat impersonations, waving sex toys around, insulting priests and generally impersonating Long John Silver as the cardboard mob moss, they really tell us nothing about either the character or the story. For all the constant repetition of his catchphrase \\"The point is,\\" there simply is no point to most of these scenes other than padding out a minor supporting character (who in the original had no particular personal relationship with either main character) enough to attract an A-list actor and in the process unbalancing the film so much that he actually becomes the leading role. Scorsese has always shown a tendency to relentlessly hammer home the same point over and over again at great length despite making it perfectly well early in the film, and too many of Nicholson's scenes seem to be like hearing exactly the same joke very slightly paraphrased over and over and over again.     Unfortunately the problem isn't limited to Nicholson's resolutely unmenacing cartoonish villain. While both Leonardo DiCaprio and Damon (looking so much like James MacArthur that at times you keep on expecting Jack Lord to turn up and say \\"Book him, Dano\\") give stronger performances than their poorly written characters deserve, too many of the supporting roles have been beefed up or created purely to add more star power. There's no narrative reason for Ray Winstone or Mark Wahlberg's clichéd characters (do Nicholson and Martin Sheen's undercover chief really need sidekicks, especially when Wahlberg's mere presence makes the last act isolation of DiCaprio utterly nonsensical?), while characters like Alec Baldwin's Steve McGarrett figure just leave the film feeling horribly overpopulated with too many people competing for screentime at the expense of the story and what should have been the central duo's dilemma. Not that there's much dilemma left. DiCaprio's undercover cop fares best, but Damon's undercover crook is much less interesting than Andy Lau's equivalent in the original - no longer torn between playing a good cop and genuinely wanting to change and become the good person he pretends to be, he's reduced to a rather bland half-dimensional stereotype while the contrived and underdeveloped romantic triangle is straight outof 30s melodrama, not helped by Vera Farmiga's tendency to change her expression every syllable in what increasingly looks like an impersonation of Corinne Bohrer. With characters this thin it's hard to get involved in the film as more than a disinterested observer and consequently there's not even any tension to any of the setpieces - the surveillance operation that goes wrong tipping both sides off to the moles in their ranks, the failed attempt by one mole to identify another at the cinema or a warehouse shootout all fall surprisingly flat even as exercises in technique.     All this would be forgivable if the film was more interesting or even sporadically exciting, but sadly it's a very dull and drawn out affair that never justifies two-and-a-half hours of screen time. The original was a tight 100-minute thriller with a great pulp premise elevated by good writing and fine performances by two directors with barely a fraction of Scorsese's talent. There's absolutely no reason that it shouldn't have been the basis for a terrific American remake that could even have improved on the original, but sadly this is a case of far too much talent for the film's own good. Distinctly Mediocrefellas.     Aside from the Scorsese on Scorsese documentary, extras are surprisingly light for a two disc set - some deleted scenes, a couple of short featurettes and a trailer.

B0014Z4OQG|4.0|First, you have to be aware of the one major complaint most people have concerning \\"Cloverfield.\\"  It will give you a headache.  Likely a major one.  As the entire film is shot through a camcorder that one of the main characters (who is running for most of the movie) is holding, there are more \\"wobbly\\" scenes than not.  Does this take away from the film?  Maybe.  However, the idea of seeing this unexplained destruction through the eyes of a person just like us is fascinating enough to convince me that the headaches were worth it.  It might not be so for you, and I think that needs to be addressed.    Second, be ready for an amazing script.  Drew Goddard ([[ASIN:B000AQ68RI Buffy]] alum) is at the top of his game, taking us effortlessly from dire soil-your-pants scenes to laugh-out-loud moments without missing a beat.  With dialogue like \\"Cloverfield\\" has, you'll certainly be quoting the one-liners very often.    Lastly, the execution of the script and the `idea' of \\"Cloverfield\\" is very impressive.  We get enough clear looks at the monster in question to satisfy the audience, but the true brilliance of this movie is that there is no explanation offered for the monster.  There is no \\"he came from space\\" or \\"he burst forth from the deepest pit of the ocean\\" nonsense.  The information we get is what we would get if we were in the main character's shoes, and that's the whole point of the movie.  I think it's fascinating.    So with a script this good and an idea so interestingly executed, I think this movie is definitely worth the (inevitable) headache.    7/10

The blair witch technique is a one and done thing, and the monster is the worst looking thing ever.
B00008EY65|4.0|I haven't read much Hellboy, but I've read [[ASIN:1593070942 enough]] to know it's a damn good story.  There are comics that really shouldn't be made into movies and there are comics that are begging to be made into movies.  This falls into the latter category.  Take the major potential of the book and pair it with [[ASIN:B000O76ZQC Pan's Labyrinth]]'s Guillermo del Toro (who is a major fan of the comic), and you've got a recipe for an epically awesome film that puts any of the recent super hero flicks to shame.<br /><br />However, Hellboy suffers from a weak beginning.  The opening scene--which is admittedly necessary for the rest of the story--comes off as really cheesy and badly acted.  The introduction of the titular character, the charismatic, gruff, and vulnerable Hellboy played wonderfully by Ron Perlman, makes the movie better, but it still doesn't seem to get its grounding until halfway through.  The dialogue and a lot of the plot is really campy, but somewhere along the middle, that aspect of the movie turns from annoying to endearing.  This movie isn't for everyone, because not everyone can take this level of camp, but for those who can stick it out, there is a really good story here.<br /><br />Always telling his story with beautiful images, del Toro drives this film forward with scene after scene of character and plot development, at once showing the kind of 'man' Hellboy is, and showing how bad the situation he is in is.  From the middle point to the apocalyptic end, this movie doesn't miss a beat.  It's funny, it's action packed, it's tear-jerking, and the end is thought-provoking; if only del Toro had put as much thought into the beginning of the film as he did the rest of it, this movie would get top marks.<br /><br />I will without a doubt be seeing the sequel in theaters.<br /><br />7/10
006135323X|2.0|While entertaining to read about the various \\"experiments\\" run on college students, the book does not provide much empirical evidence for the proposition of humans being predictably irrational.  In addition, Ariely goes from these experiments to broad social conclusions - everything from the need for more government intervention (and who can possibly think government can be more rational than the market over time?) to how we effect better healthcare.  The leaps are huge and ones that are hard to make with Ariely.  Don't let this book convince you that market forces don't work.  While it is quite well agreed that in the short run human behavior can be quite irrational, in the long run the market heads in the right direction and is quite rational.  I recommend anything written by Thomas Sowell..his Basic Economics is an excellent primer. Sowell does it in plain english without graphs or charts and the evidence he provides is well researched.

It is tragic and beautiful, and immediately reminds you of the famous National Geographic photo of the Afghani girl with the stunning green eyes, hers is the incredible potential of the people.

B000R7HY0K|4.0|The first time I watched this movie, I thought it was a little slow and not as good as Planet Terror.  Planet Terror is fast paced and action packed, and this one seemed to have a lot of superfulous scenes.  Then came the car accident scene and I was riveted.  It was, hands down, the best car crash scene I have ever seen.  Horrifying without being terribly gory (there is some gore, but it is really muted compared with your typical slasher flick).  A moment of cinematic poetry.  Same with the second half of the movie; a lot of dialogue that builds to an amazing car chase scene.  But then I watched it again and since I knew what was coming I could focus more on the interaction between the characters and the character study, and I was able to pick out the very subtle nuances that made the dialogue more enjoyable.  Kurt Russell is the bad guy you root for, not so much because the girls are so unlikeable, but because he is so likeable, even though he's derranged.  Butterfly's character is striking, most notably during her exchange with Stuntman Mike prior to her dance.  Rose McGowan shines as Pam (I love the scene where she's talking about her connection to Jungle Julia).  Bottom line, it may take a few viewings, but this movie offers some good lines, although you have to pay attention to get them all, some seriously AMAZING songs (the dance scene comes to mind), and some phenomenal stunts/car scenes.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is, by far, the best adaptation of P&P! And,... it's fun! It truly keeps to Jane Austen's spirit of the story and every character is played with authenticism. Costumes, sets, and manners are true to the period. I was surprised at how amusing the story was! Even my husband laughed!    Colin Firth steals the show as Mr. Darcy. What an actor! He simply smoulders! His portrayal is so true that one can no longer picture Darcy in any other form, once seen here. Darcy is a complex man, and not all as confident as one assumes at first. Firth brings out both Darcy's strengths and his shortcomings in a very appealing performance. Thank you very much, Mr. Firth!    Best scenes are Elizabeth's refusal of Darcy's first proposal and her confrontation with Lady Catherine. His second proposal and their reconciliation is also done perfectly. And, yes,... Mr. Darcy emerging from the lake.... need I say more?    This is the best by far!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Sometimes I find connections to Hollywood in the strangest places.  In the case of Dexter, it was at my day job. Now my office job is not normally the place one associates with a show like Dexter, but it turns out that the sister of the guy I worked with worked on the show. The fact that the show is on Showtime and thus can portray gore and violence as appropriate to the medium (like HBO's Rome, for example) piqued my curiosity. Unfortunately, it took me over a year to actually view season one.  I'm sorry I waited so long.<br /><br />I've done enough research on serial killers (and their fictional cousin, slashers) to know that they're easy to mess up.  And an entire season about a serial killer from the serial killer's perspective is fraught with peril. Fortunately, Dexter hits all the right notes to keep an audience engaged for the entire season.<br /><br />Dexter Mogran (Michael C. Hall) is a serial killer with a cause.  His father, Harry (James Remar) recognized his adopted son's homicidal tendencies and trained him to stalk the most despicable of prey.  These were the lowest of the low, the scum that Harry in his job as a cop saw frequently escape justice.  Dexter became a Final Solution of sorts, eliminating people neatly and efficiently while at the same time fulfilling insatiable desire for bloodshed.  Literally.<br /><br />In his day job, Dexter is a blood spatter analyst.  He works side-by-side with his adopted sister, Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), probably the most annoying character in the show.  And yet, she's annoying on purpose - her frail, waif-like reactions to men and the rigors of her job make her alternately pathetic and vulnerable, feral and misguided.  In short, she needs Dexter's calm, creepy presence. Rounding out the cast is career-climbing Maria Laguerta (Lauren Velez), coworkers Angel Batista (David Zayas) and Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee, formerly of the show Chuck) and my favorite character, foul-mouthed Sergeant James Doakes (Erik King).  Doakes is the only person who sees Dexter for what he is, but he can't prove it.<br /><br />Dexter feigns a personal life as well.  He has a girlfriend, Rita Bennett (Julie Benz), whose last relationship was so emotionally scarring that she fears intimacy, which suits Dexter just fine.  Indeed, all of Dexter's life is an act, from the jokes he cracks to the donuts he brings to the pleasantries he exchanges with Rita.  He's a monster masquerading as a person, and the only reason it's not more obvious is because everyone else has more pressing problems.<br /><br />Dexter's job puts him in a unique position to both appreciate the art of the kill and find new victims. Despite his penchant for murdering his victims, Dexter's murders are relatively clean - he drains his victims of blood, hacks the pieces up, and tosses them into the ocean.  And so it goes: find some sleazeball who escaped justice, kidnap him or her, murder, dump the body, repeat. Until one day, another serial killer who seems to know intimate details about Dexter's past begins sending messages through his own unique style of doll-like murders.<br /><br />The ending of season one won't be a shock to observant viewers.  It's not the actual ending that matters but the journey getting there. Dexter's narration is amusing and wry, his cadence just off enough that he comes across as disturbed yet functional. Surprisingly, the show isn't very gory at all.  Dexter would probably be less sympathetic if we were subjected to every grisly detail.  In fact, by cutting away from the most gruesome scenes, Dexter has to remind us that he's one of the bad guys - the Code of Harry is as much the anti-hero's code that we see in a multitude of other crime-fighting shows.  It's a credit to the writers that Dexter is both a monstrous, damaged human being and yet still human.<br /><br />Can't wait for season two!o sees Dexter for what he is, but he can't prove it.

He's a monster masquerading as a person, and the only reason it's not more obvious is because everyone else has more pressing problems.    Dexter's job puts him in a unique position to both appreciate the art of the kill and find new victims. Despite his penchant for murdering his victims, Dexter's murders are relatively clean - he drains his victims of blood, hacks the pieces up, and tosses them into the ocean.  And so it goes: find some sleazeball who escaped justice, kidnap him or her, murder, dump the body, repeat. Until one day, another serial killer who seems to know intimate details about Dexter's past begins sending messages through his own unique style of doll-like murders.     The ending of season one won't be a shock to observant viewers.  It's not the actual ending that matters but the journey getting there. Dexter's narration is amusing and wry, his cadence just off enough that he comes across as disturbed yet functional. Surprisingly, the show isn't very gory at all.  Dexter would probably be less sympathetic if we were subjected to every grisly detail.  In fact, by cutting away from the most gruesome scenes, Dexter has to remind us that he's one of the bad guys - the Code of Harry is as much the anti-hero's code that we see in a multitude of other crime-fighting shows.  It's a credit to the writers that Dexter is both a monstrous, damaged human being and yet still human.      Can't wait for season two!
6302470021|1.0|They're obviously releasing a 40th anniversary of this disaster to cash in on the latest James Bond film scheduled to be released in November.<br /><br />Will it work?  Who knows.<br /><br />The 1967 spoof of CASINO ROYALE was an expensive trainwreck of the highest order.  Most of the time, it functions on the level of a bad Frankie & Annette Beach movie.  The only funny parts belong to Woody Allen as Little Jimmy Bond and his mad plot to kill all men taller than him.<br /><br />Want to make this interesting?  Address the utter chaos of the making of the film.  Four or five directors, the ever-evolving script reaching for complete mediocrity, etc.<br /><br />This is the movie where Peter Sellers (who was insane) walked off the set and never came back...and the producers didn't care.  They merely gave the rest of the film to David Niven as a stuttering, older Bond.  One biography said Sellers left after Orson Welles mistook Sellers for Woody Allen in an elevator and another said it was just Sellers losing it and wrecking another movie (check out THE LIFE & DEATH OF PETER SELLERS film or the excellent biography, MR. STRANGELOVE).<br /><br />But, please, don't try and trick people into thinking this was a 1960s classic.<br /><br />(If you do like this for its 60s look and feel, then also check out WHAT'S NEW, PUSSYCAT?  It also has a big cast and actually delivers some laughs.)

B0014Z4OQG|1.0|You'd be better off taking your money outside and giving it to a homeless person.  I don't know who's idea it is to create a movie of a crappy filmed movie, but I'll not ever, repeat, EVER rent another one like it.  This movie is of the same quality as Blair Witch Project.  It sucked.
B0010MTL8O|1.0|This is not a SACD as it was said in the item description, it's a import cd from Japan, not the Mo-Fi rdition.
B00013RC8O|4.0|If you are looking for a movie with chases than this is for you.Barry Newman drives a challenger from Denver to California in 15 hours....Or tries to anyway.Please beware of the PG version,stick with the R.I enjoyed this version better.Clevon Little is the blind DJ who warns him of danger.There is even a scene in here where AL SHARPTON would protest if it was released today.One thing I found troubling is everybody involved in here racing after him or challenging him to some road dual was wearing a helmet.I guess they ran out of stunt people.
B0011NVC9I|3.0|I think what I liked about the movie was seeing it in 3D.  On DVD it is a big let down.
B0013V33DG|5.0|I Just watched the live HD Performance from the Met...This is the same production and the jokes are the same but you just can't keep smiling (laughing) this is a really good comedy. More operas buffas should be done like this. Highly reccomended. The price is a great bargain...
B000QCUB8I|4.0|Cet album gouverne. C'est dommage la division de Basillios d'eux juste avant le relâchement de cet album. Bien que Basillios > l'album est solide... il n'a pas juste le même succès commercial comme la Justice. Il semble comme il sera le Dave Mustaine de musique électronique.    Bon Album.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a fabulous DVD collection...So glad to find it on Amazon's site and get for a very reasonable amount and in great condition.

B000YABYLA|2.0|but not me.<br />Ellen Page was reasonably good but a basically one note quirky character, with the most ridiculous unbelievable words coming out of her 16 yr old mouth, though granted, I would rather have heard more of those strange phrases instead of the inevitable \\" totally\\" and \\"like\\" that she and her blonde friend used way too much throughout. From wacky to banal, it seemed way too forced.Juno's robotic quirkiness ( and I mean the character not the actress)  continued pretty much throughout the movie ( except for below mentioned van scene).<br />I did like Jennifer Garner, she conveyed desperation and longing that was very sweet and real. But I found it completely impossible to connect or believe in any of the other characters or the story line, starting with the 1st scene where Juno is on the lawn looking at the recliner chair. Later, her friend has to help her move the chair to Juno's van, but then somehow Juno was able to pull the chair out of the van and set it up by her little self on the boyfriend's lawn along with the rug and living room accessories ( not to mention the pipe? Uh.. why?). Why did she do that? How did she do that by herself? Just an example of oh-so-lets be quirky but just not engaging.<br />And wait! for a supposedly smart girl who took health classes ( she refers to the health class) , it was not believable that she would not have used condoms or foam or some kind of protection. It did not fit with the smart ( although unbelievable) worldliness of the character. It wasn't as if there was an unstoppable heat of passion and she lost her head... it was clear that she was the instigator ( which I am not against, but it just was not believable)<br />And the unfortunate music chosen... I ended up muting whenever any of the music came on.<br />The movie did pick up when Juno had the emotional breakdown in the van, there was finally a human being being portrayed instead of a snappy dialogue spewing actress pretending to be a teenager.<br />Oh and PS the pregnancy prosthetics were the worst. It looked like she had pillows tucked and falling...<br />OK I gave 2 stars because the last few scenes were pretty good. Or maybe they seemed good because I knew the movie was almost over.sthetics were the worst. It looked like she had pillows tucked and falling...   OK I gave 2 stars because the last few scenes were pretty good. Or maybe they seemed good because I knew the movie was almost over.
B0000669JL|5.0|this is the best cd ever made. this music could someday have the ability to stop wars.      Long live the soul of Robert Marley
B0010X73ZG|5.0|I purchased this dvd from the U.S as i am in England, & over here we don`t know when it`s being released, so i just bought it as i love Stephen King & Thomas Jane. The dvd i received lived up to my expectations, all the extra`s are great, & the black & white version of the film gives it more of a gritty edge, that i think in some ways is better than the colour version. As for the film itself, i thought it was excellent, good special effects, great cast & great director, as for the ending, absolutely amazing, i won`t spoil it, but WOW! Would highly recommend the film & the 2 disc version of The Mist.
B000002GZ1|5.0|This was an amazing album when it was released in 1965, and it is now.<br />While the vinyl seems superior to the CD [I have 2 copies of the vinyl]<br />they are both amazing and full of energy. There is a note on the back of the original album cover advising to play loud for maximum effect. That is just as true now as it was then....These are the guys that played with Dylan at times. That is, Sam Lay, Jerome Arnold, Mike Bloomfield.
0765318741|2.0|I purchased this book since the movie was good.  I figure the book would be even better.  I was so wrong.  Of course, if you like vampires, then you will like this book.  The ending was uneventful and confusing.
0061122416|4.0|The lesson of this book is one that my father has been teaching me since i was a boy, and that is the best way to learn something is to get up and do it.  Everyone that I look up to has also told me the same thing.  The best way to achieve your dreams is to take the first step.
B0012EM5D8|5.0|My 4 yr. old and I love this movie.  It's very entertaining, lots of fun and what I like the most is that it includes a great lesson about nature and how everything works together.
B000HEVALC|4.0|My husband really likes this CD.  We had originally heard about it at Sun Studios in Memphis and it is everything they said it was.
B000Q6KYOA|3.0|I ordered this lens hood for my Canon EOS Rebel XSi camera lens based on a recommendation of what others who had purchased my camera had purchased. It was listed as being the lens hood to fit my camera, but it did not fit - it was much too big. I ended up returning it for a full refund.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I like that Jillian breaks down all the moves. She makes it fun to workout. You can also follow along according to your ability.
B000002MTR|5.0|I really don't care much for the people behind the music, but the music itself.     Looking at it that way, this is probably the best of the Chili Peppers catalog. It's a wonderful, fluid, albeit slightly chaotic mix of funk, metal, jazz, progressive, psychedelia, gothic, and punk, filled with thick grooves from Flea, textured guitar from Navarro, powerful drumming from Smith, and suave to aggressive vocals from Kiedis.     A true, bold experimental record, and the epicenter of a mixed reaction amongst the Chili Peppers fan base, it is still a good album to listen to and worth the listen. It's nice detour from the typical, predictable songwriting pattern that they follow with Frusciante, and this album shows how creative the instrumentalist can be in how the utilize their knowledge and talent at their respective instruments, and how well Kiedis  can write very thought-provoking, nostalgic, personal lyrics that are more than just verbal expressions of the sound.
B0013FBS20|5.0|After seeing this film in theaters I went out and purchased the novella upon which it is based.  While I was fascinated by the film, the book is far superior.  Rather than being a family man and scientist attempting to cure the virus, Neville is an ordinary man who takes it upon himself to kill as many of the infected as possible.  Ultimately he realizes that the creatures he hunts are not necessarily evil, but that there has been a paradigm shift:  humanity has \\"evolved\\" and he is the evil \\"legend\\" unmercifully killing those that are normal.  I found that version more compelling as the Neville portrayed there more closely resembles what I believe to be the average American male.  Also, that version of the story is significantly more intellectually intriguing.<br /><br />While the alternate version contained in the DVD/HD DVD/Blu-ray version is different in several ways from the book, in ways that I will not mention so as not to spoil the book for those who have not yet read it, I think that it contains that intriguing paradigm shift theme around which Matheson based his story.  Obviously Hollywood is going to take creative license with a film in their adaptation, but if they would have instead released this \\"alternate version\\" in theaters I think that they would have had a more successful film as it would have well adapted the story to make it more exciting while retaining the intellectual elements.  Well, at least they included it on the DVD!
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|By the word \\"trend\\", I mean that it seems as if the new \\"in\\" thing to do in Hollywood films is to have a movie with no ending.    Just like \\"No Country for Old Men\\", \\"Cloverfield\\" starts off with an interesting premise, a great story, heart-stopping action.....and then everything abruptly ends.    What's worse, these \\"endings\\" aren't realy endings at all. Things happen and then they stop happening.    >>>POSSIBLE SPOILERS TO FOLLOW<<<    There is no plot resolution. We are left with so many questions. What WAS the creature attacking New York City? Where did it come from? Was the military able to defeat it? Did the 2 main protagonists survive? The biggest questions of all was \\"What was the friggin' point to all of this?\\".    One of the biggest gripes seems to have been the shaky camera and nonsensical edits throughout the film which was supposed to give a gritty realism to make the viewer think he or she was watching an amateur video recording of a horrifying event. This type of filming, which has been done before in \\"The Blair Witch Project\\", really didn't bother me and, to me, DID succeed in giving the film that \\"gritty realism\\".    The special effects are really quite good and the film does succeed in giving the viewer a sense of dread and horror (or at least, nervousness). You really sympathize with the characters and hope they make it through this horror.    And that's the biggest problem with \\"Cloverfield\\"; YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY DO OR NOT. Sure, SOME of the main characters HAVE to die. It's inevitable in movies like this, but the MAIN characters fates are unrevealed?    What's going on in Hollywood? Just like \\"No Country for Old Men\\", \\"Cloverfield\\" seems to think that an interesting premise, good special effects, excellent acting (only applies to \\"No Country\\"), and heart-stopping action is a good enough excuse to make a movie. Nevermind the fact that we should come up with an ending or have a meanigful or at least sensible plot resolution. Let's just film thething, release a whole lot of hype and media buzz about it, make a zillion, and then laugh at the viewing public as we take their money and give them an incomplete product.    I, for one, am getting tired of it. I LOVE movies, but I want a little bang for my buck. I'm not saying that all of them should be capable of getting a five-star rating out of me (or any one else), but a least let me have the satisfaction of a movie that tells a good story and has an ending. Give me some closure.    Is that too much to ask, Hollywood?    I guess so.
0143113100|5.0|This book is packed with concrete evidence that should convince anyone who believed they could not continue to grow mentally and physically that they were strongly mistaken.
0765318741|4.0|What a fantastic concept for a story.  I saw the movie \\"Omega Man\\" when I was kid and loved it and did not realize it was based on this tale until I read through some of these reviews.  Two basic comments about this book.  First, the story \\"I am Legend\\" only takes up about half the book.  The rest is made up of short stories that just weren't anywhere close to as good as \\"I am Legend\\" in my opinion.  In fact I became very bored with them and had to put the book down a few times.  Because of that I am downgrading the book overall to 4 stars.<br /><br />Having said that, I could not put the book down at all while reading the \\"I am Legend\\" story.  To set up the tale:  there could well be only one man left on earth as some sort of vampire virus has spread, possibly through biological warfare.  The time is in the 70's which is the future when you consider this book was written in the 50's.  The tale delves into this one man's fight against vampires who try to get at him every night.  He has turned his house into a fortress.  In the day he ventures out in search of the vampires to kill them while they sleep.  He also fills his time with trying to solve the mystery of what the virus is and where it came from.  Very intriguing.  Could not put the book down.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Wellington's \\"13 Bullets\\" and \\"99 Coffins\\" you will definately like this one.  I have not seen the movie yet and from what I hear, the movie does not follow the story line of the book.  Book was fantastic!
B001437DMA|2.0|I have to agree with Aglobotomy. I am a Satch fan of approximately 20 years and own just about all the stuff he has put out. Not impressed with this CD, with a few exceptions. As a matter of fact, the last CD I REALLY loved was Crystal Planet. Why can't he make my jaw drop like he used to? Asik Vaysel is great and balls-to-the-wall-Joe like I used to expect from Satch. I bought the Professor Satchafunkilus CD on Sunday and here it is Monday and I am ready to Ebay it.
0307265730|5.0|Jhumpa Lahiri has written another masterpiece. Each of the stories addresses a different human conundrum. The characters were well developed (even in the short story format), which allowed me to empathize with the challenges they face.  As I've come to expect from Jhumpa Lahiri, her lyrical writing communicates intense feelings without resorting to melodrama.  I found this book to meet my qualifications for a \\"perfect\\" book--the combination between beautiful writing and a compelling story.  Unaccustomed Earth is a truly oustanding collection.
B00005NTJK|5.0|MY COPY HAS A PRINTING ERROR ON THE INSERT.      This is Jethro Tull's third album.  This is a remastered version and the sound quality is excellent.    The original album was 10 songs and 42 minutes long.  Some bonus material has been added, but it is nothing special.  These bonus tracks have been floating around and have been available on other Tull albums, like the 20th anniversary CD boxset.      The CD comes with a nice booklet, but mine was misprinted.  The outside cover is OK, but the inside pages are for the album This Was.    Benefit is just a great collection of songs.  After this, the group would do Aqualung and then Thick As A Brick.  After that, things slowly went downhill.  Anderson has written some good songs since then and put out some nice music.  But nothing has done has been as strong as what he did with his first 5 albums.      The concert tours to support this ablum were great.  The group really played around with the songs.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I was just as fascinated with Zach's sister, nephew, ex-girlfriend, and best friend as I was with the two male leads, that is a true compliment.  I   ordered this movie off Here! TV and watched it 5 times before the 24 hours elapsed.  I quickly pre-ordered it from Amazon.  I like all kinds of movies but some movies are content to just put two good-looking guys on screen, take their shirts off, let them get touchy and hope it plays.  This one came through.  You really wanted Zach to make the right decision and even agonized with what would become of little Cody if he didn't.  And of course, two good-looking guys make out.  That's a plus...not the whole show!  Also, the soundtrack is wonderful!  Truly a charming and inspiring romance.
B000NA28A2|5.0|It isn't often that I am delighted with a CD.  Juan Luis Guerra y 440 are amazing together.  Perfect is the only way to describe this CD.  These songs are not just fillers to take up space.  Every one of them is well thought out and crafted.  Juan Luis Guerra is a composer who performs - not just a song writer.  The melodies and harmonies are wonderful.  He and 440 must be obsessed with perfection because it shows in this CD.  And it seems that they are having a great time performing.    All the tunes are catchy and even though I only speak a little Spanish, I still get enough to understand that he has a turn of phrase and a sense of humor.    I recommend this CD to anyone, and you don't need to know Spanish.  It is upbeat and makes you want to dance, dance, dance, dance!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I loved 30 Day Shred!! What an awesome workout DVD! I loved that I could do my cardio, strength training, and abs all in my little apartment. Jillian gives great tips,advice, and encouragement while you are doing your workout. She is constantly reminding you of your goals and why you are there which makes you want to continue and not give up when it starts getting hard. She gives you a complete workout that gets your heart pumping, muscles burning, and the sweat dripping. I follow her routine every day! Great DVD!!
B000P12LWY|5.0|I love it for what it is. A great period costume drama. As other reviewers have mentioned it is not historically accurate, however the characters are engaging and mostly believable in their roles. The costumes and backdrops are visually appealing. I plan to watch the rest of the series as it becomes available. This series has violence and sexual scenes (which include nudity) so it would not be appropriate to watch in front of some audiences.
B0008JIJ2E|4.0|This is one of the definitive movies of the 80's and is a source of great memories for many people, don't ruin them by listening to the commentary track.<br /><br />This is a review of the commentary track:<br /><br />Like most DVD collectors, I am usually swayed by the insight of the director's commentary, but this one left me feeling sad.<br /><br />Involved in the commentary is the director, a producer, Ralph Macchio, Pat Morita and the screenwriter.  The director provides very calm insightful memoirs when he is given the chance, but that is overshadowed by the belligerent (and senile) Pat Morita who thinks he is Mr. Miyagi.<br /><br />Mr. Morita spends the whole movie bickering with the screenwriter over what was in the script and what he came up with on his own while filming.  Basically trying to give credit to himself and Ralph Macchio for the whole production, which really shatters your image of Miyagi.<br /><br />Ralph Macchio is caught in the middle of the arguements as the voice of reason trying to calm everyone down, as the rest of the crew looks to him like \\"The Golden Boy\\".<br /><br />There are some interesting memories and fond rememberances by the crew, but it's really hard to move past the negativity on the track.<br /><br />Luckily the special feature documentaries are heavily edited and avoid any of the ugliness of the commentary.<br /><br />My advice is to enjoy the movie and don't turn on the commentary.
B00003CXDV|5.0|This DVD version of a great movie was offered at a graet price by Amamzon.
B000AM1TGC|5.0|Already owned for many years in lp form. Bought for the covience of cd. Have favored Hacket's first four solo records since originally released.
B001152TL6|5.0|I love this movie, great acting, music score, directing, setting, suspence, and good character combo.  However, I have to admit, I was completely at loss when Bill Pullman transformed, also I didn't really get it when there were two Patricials, the blonde, and the burnette, then all of a sudden there was only the burnette.  As I said I really like this movie, but didn't really understand it.... Was everyone in it dead? Please reply
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|The \\"shaky-cam\\" has been mentioned by many of you.  I have friends who refuse to see this video because of it.  I personally didn't mind the shaking so much as the obvious attempts to make the camerawork look as bad as possible.    The movie opens at a party.  For the first 15 minutes of the film, there is no monster, yet I find this some of the most annoying camera work of the entire film.  Often times the camera is crooked.  This is SO unbelievable!  Hand a camera to anyone and ask them to film a bunch of people, I doubt the crooked camera happens.  Much more likely is trying to shoot somebody without looking at the viewfinder/ screen only to realize you're only capturing the bottom or side of their face.  Any amateur, in my opinion, would at least hold the camera somewhat upright.    So it's not only annoying, you know it's deliberately exaggerated, making it doubly annoying.    During many of the action scenes, the camera work actually gets better.  When somebody should be running for their lives, using both arms to run faster, the camera is actually more parallel with the ground than when they're sompelace quiet and safer.  I'm not buying it.  I expect the whole reason for this is that the action sequences are easier to animate and are more effective given a somewhat stable camera.    I guess the makers of this film also assume we're so used to so-called \\"reality TV\\" that people will just talk freely and don't mind the fact you've got a camera pointed at them.  That might happen after several days of being the subject of a reality TV show, but not in real life.  Why would anybody film everything their friends are going through?  Missing is the real reaction these people would have: \\"Get that f---ing camera out of my face or I'll ...\\"!!!    And aren't there certain times where you'd just turn off the camera rather than be burdened with filming?  Like when the parasites are attacking you?  Maybe put down your camera and fight them off?    Thank goodness for whathappens to the cameraman!  Why couldn't it have happened at least an hour earlier?    Other than that, the movie was good.  You got a real sense of the panic and the way things might happen.  It was a lot more chaotic than other \\"large monster attacks city\\" films, where the scientists and military are working together to destroy the monster.  This was a story of the people caught in the middle, not where the monster came from and how he dies.    I don't mind that his origins are unknown.  If something like this were to really happen, we wouldn't have all of the answers in the first 7 hours?  To me, it's scarier about not knowing.    If it just weren't for the amateur film angle, I think it would have been great.  I can see where the makers maybe thought it didn't bring anything new to the table and this was their way of doing that.  The story alone would have worked.  It's different in the fact that you didn't involve scientists and a military command center, just regular people.  But the shaky cam and unrealistic reactions of people took away from it.    Can other filmmakers learn a lesson on shaky-cam?
0393327655|5.0|I've now read this book by Sam Harris and also The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins -- both excellent pieces of work.  Both very eye-opening and enlightening.  For those of us who are tired of living under the oppression of the evangelicals of every religion; both Muslim and Christian specifically, this is a a wake-up call about how society itself needs to change before essentially opposing forces draw us all into a war that will ensure mutual destruction.  Please recommend this book to anyone who needs to wake up from their religious delusions.
B0010AN7Z4|5.0|This is a classic to be added to any movie collector's collection.  It is the basis for the Broadway musical, \\"Promises, Promises.\\"  It is the first collaboration of Shirley MacLaine and Jack Lemmon.  They are a match made in heaven.

1401207529|5.0|Next to The Dark Knight Returns, this is one of the best Graphic Novels I've ever read. I wish they would have used this movies storyline in a Movie, but doubt that would not have been as great a marketing decision. There is no Batmobile, no Ras Al Ghul, no Joker, not even any fancy high tech gadgets that Batman now has. It's just the simple beginings of Batman, written by Frank Miller.
B0012HCASA|4.0|Let's hope they don't mess it up.The pilot was fantastic,but the writers strike affected how many episodes we saw........
078322611X|5.0|I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it, my VHS tape broke I watched it some many times, so very glad it is out on DVD, If your fighting with your son and he is old enough to understand, tie him to a chair and make him watch this movie with you so someday it's not to late to make up or make piece with your son for what ever reason, because in real life dad can not come back to ease his pain or yours.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I really enjoy this workout video and it gives me a GREAT workout. I love that it's only 20-25 minutes, but it really gives me a full workout - cardio, muscle toning, and abs. I have noticed a difference in my body too. I highly recommend this product.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I'd seen this countless times online and at stores. I didn't get a hold of it until nearly every major store stopped selling them. The price most asked was ranged from $50-$60 USD and when I saw the price of around $26 I just jumped at the chance to get it on Amazon.com. Right off the bat I could tell this collection was the most complete Aliens could ever get with a total of 9 disks.     With the choice of watching the original, theater viewed films, the deleted scene addition was glory in itself. It's true what some reviewers will say about seeing the deleted scenes, once you see them, you wont want to go back to the original. The additional disks to each film disk have a ton of footage to watch. Concept art, documentaries, theatrical trailers, all of it.    I've always been fascinated with the Aliens universe and I can say with this Alien Quadrilogy I am very satisfied with the amount it provides to questions and mysteries that are the Xenomorphs and the Weyland 'Company'. Even to this day the special effects of each and every Alien movie never gave me room to criticize, for that I am thrilled.    Don't hesitated to buy this collection, I didn't :D.

1416914293|5.0|This book was better than the first (City of Bones). I coudn't put it down. Now I'm not going to give away any details but this book keeps you thinking
0743270754|5.0|This is one of those books that, when you are finished, you need a few minutes to sit and let it all sink in. It is a powerful, wonderful, insightful book that I was almost sorry to finish, for multiple reasons -- it was engrossing, and of course it didn't end well.    Goodwin does an excellent job of bringing Lincoln to life and showing his incredible talents for managing people. I had some knowledge about Lincoln, but when I finished this book, I was left with a feeling of sadness, not only for him and his friends and family, but for the country, because we were deprived of four years of Lincoln's leadership. And who knows how things would have turned out in the South and the country as a whole had he been able to preside over the infant stages of Reconstruction.    The relationship between Lincoln and Seward was a pleasure to learn about, as well as the way Lincoln dealt with the various personalities around him without creating personal enemies. Reading about his interactions with Frederick Douglass was also a special part of the book.    While this book may be long (about 750 pages) for those with only a casual interest in history, I would still recommend it to anyone. It is a remarkable book about a remarkable man.
B00064WSNW|5.0|It isn't surprising that this album has no one star reviews (at least not at the time of this writing) as it is one of the best albums of the 1980's, and one of King Crimson's enduring masterpieces.  It was the first album after a seven year hiatus, and Fripp and company didn't start where they left off from 1974's Red.  Fripp, Bill Bruford, and new members Adrian Belew and Tony Levin went off in a completely different direction, and it was brilliant.  My favorite songs are the opener Elephant Talk, the equally beautiful songs Frame by Frame and Matte Kudesai, and the scary and tense Thela Hun Jingeet.  There isn't a dud on the whole album, and honestly, all of my Crimson albums are pretty damn solid.  They weren't a band to waste notes.  This was also my first King Crimson album, one that I still love.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|I got the OST before the movie and basically I watched it for the music, This guy really knows how to sing, just amazing!!!  (For the guy who wrote the editorial review: next time you don't need to say -or suggest- that the main character dies at the end...DUH!!!)
B0013FBS20|5.0|The opening moments of this film are some of the most simple, gripping, shocking camera shots ever devised. Seeing New York city overrun by nature with absolutely no hint of human life definitely struck a nerve with both me and the audience, and the best part is that the camera never tries to show off the impressive visual effects (most of which are entirely invisible). The focus is on the main character, as it should be, as well as how the outbreak happened and how he struggles to fix what he started. Millions of \\"Virus Outbreak Mutation\\" films have been devised over the past few decades, which makes I Am Legend even that much more impressive. It never feels like it belongs in the genre due to the multi-layered nature of the piece, as well as the clever progression and documentary-like feel.     Francis Lawrence made an impressive debut with Constantine, and I Am Legend proves that he's on track to becoming one of the defining filmmakers of our generation, just as Spielberg and Scorsese defined their's.

B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Let me just say Alterbridge really stepped it up with this album and proved that they are more than Creed's leftovers. This band has really come into their own style and message and shown what they can do!  Every track on this CD was solid which i'm hesitant to say about any CD because usually I feel there is always room for improvement. This CD I can honestly say is one of the best cd's i've ever owned. Not only that but their live performance was even more incredible. I feel strongly that Alterbridge has been extremely underrated.    I would say that Track 12 (White Knuckles) is my favorite song on the album, even though it's very hard to chose. The lyrics and melody of this song really are a good summation of the album and what it's about. It's a song of stepping up and standing out and not letting others bring you down with their negative energy \\"Run for your life, Dreams are not theirs to take\\" what an excellent line.    Other strong tracks I would recommend even though I love the whole album would be Ties that bind, Buried Alive, and Coming Home. All very deeply emotional and powerfully energetic songs.    These songs obviously are aside from the singles that are great as well such as Rise Today, and Watch over you, and newest single Before Tomorrow comes.    HONESTLY.. BUY THIS CD YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! Every single track is more and more worth the money. If you don't like it i would give the money back myself. It's really just that good!
B0017I91LI|5.0|First off about one-third of the negative reviews are about the packaging of the DVD, an issue if you wish to purchase the DVD, but not just to rent the film.  As for the other substantive criticisms raised--its boring, too dark, no story, anti-religious--I personally did not find any of these valid.  The opening twenty minutes had me engrossed both with the brutal life led by these men, the flimsy contraptions used to extract oil, and the introduction of the Plainview character.We see his gritty determination, ingenuity, and even tenderness adopting the son of a man killed at the oil field.  All of this is done wordlessly.  Then we hear the first words--Plainview's sales pitch to a community that has just discovered oil.  And soon after we meet Eli Sunday, a young man whose ambition equals Plainview's.  In the scene where Eli and Plainview haggle over selling the Sunday ranch, we can see that his interests are not purely spiritual, but more power and control.  The two characters begin a dangerous and ultimately tragic struggle for the upper hand.  The dramatic tension comes from the struggle of these two characters to achieve their ends, and from the relationships between Plainview and his son, Eli Sunday and his father, and Eli and Plainview. Several parallel scenes highlight the impact of one on the other, leading to the tragic conclusion.  The acting throughout is first class, especially Daniel Day Lewis, and the cinematography is wonderful.  I do agree that the score is intrusive particularly in the middle of the film, surprising given how well PTA has used music in the past.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|The CD is wonderful...it came very quickly after I ordered it, and I listen to it often.
1591841992|5.0|This a terrific complement to Presentation Zen . Roam tells you exactly how to use an empirical, tried and works-in-the-trenches approach to illustration and solving problems (Unpeeling the onion and then building something very powerful ) He then shows that there is scientific evidence on how we see and process info that follows the same models his solution uses. Lesson learned, following my reading on creating more insightful and powerful presentations he also adds the nugget that showing and telling are two different worlds. After you have created the very insightful image, it is important to build it in front of the audience using a thoughtful order.  Thus, they can discover it too. This book would be great as a consultants handbook on clear communication. If you need to communicate clearly, get this book. It is clear, well written and follows his use of images to also lead you to understanding.
B000YPUF9W|5.0|This is a good addition to your Resident Evil collection, and one that I do not regret buying. I would recommend this movie if this is your type of movies.
B000XA5K4I|4.0|This film does have a plot, but to be honest it is hardly important to this sort movie. The action is frantic and completely silly that puns are hilariously bad. It really is one of those films that once you have seen the opening you will know if you will like it. It isn't for everyone, it is the definition of high octane dumb action movie. Clearly made as a blokes movie, although my Missus loved it as well, it ain't no date movie.<br />Is it a worthwhile Blu ray purchase? If you like the film sure if not then you would be dumb to buy it anyway, and if you aren't sure, rent it.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|On the two disc edition of The Mist, on disc 2 there is a glorious Black and White version of the film, with an introduction by the director Frank Darabont.  Darabont says he originally wanted The Mist to be in B&W and be a throwback to the 50's and 60's horror movies such as [[ASIN:B0013D8LAE Night of the Living Dead]], which I felt it had a lot in common with.  Darabont says this can be considered his director's cut.  I knew he directed two other King favorites [[ASIN:B0002J4ZWS The Shawshank Redemption (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B00003CWQU The Green Mile]], but I didn't realize his other contributions to the horror genre, until I checked out IMDB.  Starting in 1980 as a production assistant on [[ASIN:B00000JXVP Hell Night]] and going on to write the screenplays for [[ASIN:0780630866 A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 - Dream Warriors]], [[ASIN:B00005N5RM The Blob]], [[ASIN:B0009X76XC The Fly II (Collector's Edition)]], and [[ASIN:0767811097 Mary Shelley's Frankenstein]].    The Mist is an entertaining, at times infuriating, tragic horror film filled with fun scares in the form of 50s and 60s era monsters lurking in the mist outside and the uglier monsters inside that apply to our present day, a true creature double feature.     Darabont reminded me of Romero and his use of horror and social commentary.  Here he makes an atmospheric horror movie, our main character, David Drayton, played by, Thomas Jane, ([[ASIN:B00002E233 Deep Blue Sea]]) designs posters for horror movies, followed by a big storm, and ultimately has David and his son (mom at home) trapped in a supermarket with the towns people.  Similar to the mall in [[ASIN:B000UR9QIK Dawn of the Dead [Blu-ray]]] evil lurks outside the market, not in the form of zombies that can be seen, but old school monsters that lurk out in the mist.  That's the surface of the film, but as we go through the layers we find much more, such as the monsters that lurk inside the supermarket.   Human nature, when afraid andbacked into a corner and the role the military plays once the smoke clears are some of the movie's other factors.     The Black and White Version is the way to go, to get that old school feel the director intended, even the way the title on the dvd is written is like an old monster movie.  Highly Recommended, one of King's best film adaptations.    2 DISC DVD FEATURES (FROM BACK OF DVD)   DISC I Features Commentary by Writer/Director Frank Darabont - Deleted Scenes with optional commentary - Drew Struzan: An appreciation of an artist - Behind the scenes webisodes - Trailer Gallery Dolby Dig 5.1  DISC II - Frank Darabont introduces The Mist in Black & White - The Director's Vision:  The Complete Feature Film in Black & White - When Darkness came  : The Making of the mist - Taming the beast - The making of scene 35 - Monsters among us:  A look at the creature FX - The Horror of it all:  The visual FX of the mist.

B00027JZ3E|4.0|The Lost Boys is a movie that could only work in the 80s; while sometimes called a classic I don't think I would go that far, but it is a cult classic and one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen. While it is a horror movie there is nothing really scary here. And despite the R-rating it's a very light one at that. The Lost Boys is very much a product of it's time and a damn good one at that. I figured with the release of the sequel The Lost Boys: The Tribe due out this summer I might as well revisit this cult classic.<br /><br />The screenplay was written by Janice Fischer, James Jeremias & Jeffrey Boam; apparently Fischer & Jeremias wrote the first draft and it was more of a kid's movie that features pre-teens. Richard Donner was the original director, but when production was delayed he dropped out, but stayed on as executive producer, Joel Schumacher was than hired and wanted to make the characters older and I assume that is where Jeffrey Boam comes in. The screenplay though is excellent; the characters are great and almost all of them get enough screen time that we get to know them. Obviously some characters will be more developed than others, but none of them are just simply there.<br /><br />Director Joel Schumacher who often gets a lot of heat for his work on Batman Forever & Batman & Robin does a great job with The Lost Boys, due to the two Batman movies he's often called a hack and one of the worst filmmakers. Joel Schumacher isn't a great director, but he has made some really enjoyable movies sure he made some mistakes with his Batman movies and even he knows that. But with The Lost Boys he delivers one hell of a fun ride. His scenes are well paced and there really is never a boring moment at all. The comedy works well and the action scenes are extremely well-done and are a lot of fun. There isn't much suspense and tension, but that wasn't the point with this movie.<br /><br />If anything The Lost Boys is best described as a comedy/fantasy type movie, but since it includes vampires killing people it will throw it into the horror genre. I think every kid and even adults have that fantasy of killing vampires or zombies and The Lost Boys very much plays up to that. The movie runs at 97-minutes and you'll never be bored there's always something happening to hold your interest in the movie.<br /><br />What The Lost Boys is best known for now is being the very first movie to feature both Corey Haim and Corey Feldman AKA the two Corey's. After this movie they would work together several times before fading away by the end of the 80s; both Corey's work great together here. This is more of a Corey Haim movie since he plays the bigger part and he's really funny, but Feldman possibly steals the show as Edgar Frog along with Jason Newlander as Alan Frog. The Frog Brothers are played straight and serious, which makes it even funnier.<br /><br />Before he was Jack Bauer, Kiefer Sutherland was David the evil vampire. I'm a huge fan of Sutherland and this is one of his very best roles. He doesn't always have a lot of dialogue, but he has a great presence on camera and makes for one of the coolest vampires to ever appear in a movie. The rest of the cast is also excellent; Jason Patric puts in a solid performance as Michael Emerson trying to fight his vampire urges.<br /><br />The Lost Boys easily rates as one of the most fun filled movies of the 80s and one of the most fun period; there's never a slow moment The Lost Boys is always funny and a lot of fun. The DVD is excellent with some great features on the 2nd disc. I've seen The Lost Boys several times, but this is the first time I've seen it on DVD and I know there was a DVD out before, but the new one features a brand new HD transfer and the picture quality is excellent.

B0010X73ZG|4.0|...Stephen King in the hands of Frank Darabont will always be above par and this is no exception.  And what continues to always be perfect with Darabont's interpretations is the supporting cast...his crew of regulars that have shown up again for a King adaptation.  Jeffrey DeMunn is again excellent as Dan Miller as is William Sadler and Brian Libby with a minor part and not half bad...jk.  Marcia Gay Harden is great as the righteous tounge wagger and when it finally stops wagging it's a stand up and cheer moment. Kudos again Mr. Darabont...keep 'em comin'.  If you didn't like the ending too bad.  The book didn't have one so Frank made one.  Not for everyone I'm sure...but it was shocking and not for shock value sake either.  But rather good entertainment shocking...<br /><br />More like 3 1/2 stars so will rate it 4
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|If you don't want to engage in an intellectual analysis of the 'Cloverfield' viewing experience, STOP HERE.    Everyone has something to say about the \\"shaky camera\\" style and somewhat unlikeable protagonists that populate this film. Personally, I feel that both of these aspects of the film are distinct and intelligent choices. As such, they don't interest me much.     Are they well executed? Yes. Does everything work flawlessly? No. On the whole, if you shut your brain off - and you can stomach the camerawork -, is the film good? Yes.    Now, I have a different and more fundamental gripe with this movie. It boils down to this. The filmmakers think they're smart... but they're not. This is something of a bold -- and loaded -- statement so herein lies my essential argument:    'The Blair Witch Project' for all of its fault is a near-perfect 'found footage narrative.' From the text at the beginning, we learn that three filmmakers went into the woods to film a project about the Blair Witch. A year later their footage was found. The film then asks the viewer to 'participate' in the movie. We play the role of an individual who 'watches' the Blair Witch footage.    It's not tough, I know -- we're doing it anyway -- but it is a critical aspect of our enjoyment. We're supposed to both actually 'be' and 'play' curious. We buy in that the events could be real... that the film could be a real documentary... and that is what makes the movie scary.    'Cloverfield' is the same sort of movie but it doesn't understand what that requires. It asks us to 'play' the role of a viewer of this found footage but never bothers to explain WHY we're viewing it.    Now, before you get up in my grill, allow me to point out that CONTEXTUALLY, in the movie, we know that dozens of news broadcasts from New York were going out live. Hundreds of people had cameras filming the event.     If we lived in this world -- which the movie asks us to pretend that we do -- we would ask ourselves 'WHY?' beforechoosing to view this film. Why am I watching this one tape about the monster as opposed to all of the other tapes I could be watching?    Why THIS one?    You see, unlike living in a post-Blair Witch world, a post-Cloverfield Event world is radically unlike our own. Just as with 9-11, which this film heavily references visually and narratively, a new vocabulary and a new world view would have rapidly been established by the survivors.    Facts would be known. We would shorthand certain things.    Just as with a new 9-11 doc or a new JFK doc or a new moon landing doc, a post-Cloverfield event viewer would compare and contrast THIS footage with every other 'Cloverfield' video that existed. For us to actually want to watch it, this footage would need to justify itself with a new spin or a new angle to compete in the marketplace.    This film doesn't. In fact, it doesn't even try. Worse, I'm pretty sure they never even realized that, yeah, maybe they ought to try.    So, in conclusion --    These guys think they're smart -- which is always worse than knowing you're dumb.

6305558167|5.0|From the lust of Uther Pendragon and the sorcery of Merlin is born the legendary King Arthur, the Once and Future King. Claimed at birth by the wizard Merlin and raised as the son of good Sir Ector, Arthur grows up to be a wiser man than his father, though still greatly swayed by emotion over logic. His royal lineage is made known when he pulls the sword Excalibur from the stone as a boy, and from then on, Arthur rules Britain in glory until the schemes of his half-sister, the evil witch Morgana, bring his world down upon him, first by exposing the betrayal of his wife Guenevere and his best friend Lancelot, and again by laying with Arthur and creating the bloodthirsty Mordred. The round table, the quest for the grail, the whole story of Arthur, from conception to death, is told in stunning and beautiful detail in the fantasy epic \\"Excalibur\\".<br /><br />Appropriately made in 1981, a time when fantasy films were en vogue, director John Boorman's \\"Excalibur\\" is still the best film to turn to for the story of King Arthur. Cleverly balancing fantasy elements with a very believably grounded reality, Boorman's gracefully executed theme throughout the film is of the passing away of the old ways and the coming of the new. Though at times the film seems like it may have suffered a bit from covering so much information in 2 hours and 20 minutes (it is true what some have said, that the quest for the Holy Grail does seem to come out of nowhere), it is a majestic experience from start to finish and comes off as extremely lavish, despite the \\"shoestring\\" budget the director claims it was made on. The Irish locations used are glorious, the classical music is rousing, and the cast features the likes of Helen Mirren, Nicol Williamson, Gabriel Byrne, Liam Neeson, Patrick Stewart, Nigel Terry as Arthur, and many more fine actors. The DVD is unfortunately said to be incorrectly matted, and hopefully this will be corrected in a future release. Despite that, it's a movie that everyone should have in their collection and includes the theatrical trailer (I love those early '80's theatrical trailers!), a bit of text info, and a fine commentary from the director. He's not the most thrilling commentator, takes him a bit to get started and there's a big pause after he initially does, but once he gets going he gives tons of great info on the production.

Steve Jobs read the product by himself, by playing with it and I am gonna quote him \\"If I can't use it, then user won't able to use it either\\" it is like ... Walking in Users' shoes and then seeing the Super-star stuff... iPod and iPhone.<br /><br />2) Management, handling the people is the best way he is doing. But I will give him 4 stars, because .... What I learn is ... Steve disrespect the people in front of others, and I think it is harsh and not humane.<br /><br />3) Oh ... One more thing ;) .. Innovation ... yup! thats teh superb thing Apple do, create the existing stuff in to a master-piece... and become a Trend-Setter! thats what the beauty of the Apple Inc. way to go Apple , without Steve Jobs, Apple is a piece of cool sketches without color and usefulness.<br /><br />Mudassir Azeeemi<br />San Francisco, CA

0385522401|3.0|Ian McEwan is definitely one of my favorite authors, and for that reason I purchased his latest book the moment I saw it in the bookstore.  However, once I got down to reading it, I felt it really didn't live up to his other writing.  A master at setting up tension, McEwan succeeds in that regard, but I was not satisfied with how the tension was resolved.  In fact I felt like it wasn't really resolved, and it left behind this unpleasant residue to be washed down with a glass of water or perhaps another story.  The book isn't long but as I was reading it I was often interrupted by my own thoughts as I wished something would actually happen.  Rather, McEwan spends a lot of time providing backstory between glimpses of action that occur on the wedding night of the two main characters, which are the parts I found most interesting.  I felt that this mainly served to slow down the story.  Finally, I felt apathetic in regard to the characters and sometimes annoyed by them.  However, even though I didn't really enjoy the book, I did have some emotional response to it.  Some parts were redeeming, but as a whole, I was left guessing as to why Ian McEwan chose this subject matter for a novel.  Standing next to the other books of his that I've read, this seems like filler.  If you're going to get a book by him, I would point you towards some of my favorite books of all time-\\"Amsterdam\\" or \\"The Comfort of Strangers.\\"  In addition I really liked \\"The Cement Garden\\", \\"Atonement\\" and \\"Enduring Love.\\"  It's funny, he's generally so good that I actually feel guilty writing this negative review.
B000NS45DW|5.0|An absolutely brilliant novel, written by someone who loves language and painting detailed pictures with words. Priceless parental advice on what builds strong character, and it obviously ain't Wonder Bread! Strong historical, period piece (turn of the century poverty, immigration and alcoholism parallels Angela's Ashes.  Strong parenting and interwoven sibling / parental connection, overcoming obstacles religious overtones parallels Poisonwood Bible.  I like this novel better than either of those novels.  I Could not put this book down.  I loved it for many reasons, many connections on many different levels.

0790729725|5.0|Hadn't seen Goodfellas in years, last night's screening reminded me how close to perfect this movie is.<br /><br />Scorsese and company really hit it out of the park here. I actually think Liotta is better than DeNiro, who is tremendous. As are Pesci and Bracco. Everything feels authentic; these folks clearly grew up amongst real wiseguys and convey the atmosphere perfectly.<br /><br />What really lifts this flick above, however, is the perfect pacing and editing. The story moves tightly and quickly forward, with few wasted moments despite its length.<br /><br />It's also quite funny at times, though I always question whether making truly evil folks humorous (some of the real old-school wiseguys were not very funny) is a smart idea, but it's art, so each to his own.<br /><br />One thing for sure: the Sopranos pulled at least half their cast from this movie! Why mess with success?<br /><br />I disagree with Amazoon's own reviewer who calls this as good as the Godfather, though. As excellent as Goodfellas is, the first two Godfathers achieve a level of greatness and gravitas that few other movies ever have.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Goodfellas is a complete classic. If only all movies moved this well and looked this good and had this many memorable performances...
B00005NWLO|5.0|This two-disc, two-and-a-half hour deluxe edition of Skynyrd's fifth album is perhaps the most enjoyable item in their catalogue. Okay, so it's not highly intellectual music, but there are plenty of big riffs, big hooks, great melodies and smoking solos here.    The songs from the original line-up's last album, which came out the year after this one, are obviously missing, but almost all the best material from their first four LPs is here.  The many, many highlights include wonderful, crisp renditions of songs like \\"Gimme Three Steps\\", \\"I Ain't The One\\", and \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\", and a tough, gritty \\"Gimme Back My Bullets\\" which completely outdoes the studio version, as does a terrific, 8-minute \\"Tuesday's Gone\\" and a wonderful \\"Simple Kind Of Man\\". And this rollicking southern rock-version of \\"T For Texas (Blue Yodel #1)\\" is quite irresistable as well.    You'd be forgiven for thinking that Cream did a better Cream on \\"Crossroads\\", and I think a ten-minute \\"Free Bird\\" might have been better than these two 14-minute \\"Free Birds\\", but those are certainly minor complaints. This is a terrific album. The band is tight but powerful, and the sound is top-notch. No Lynyrd Skynyrd fan, casual or diehard, should miss this one.  Great, great stuff, and one of the finest live American rock records of the decade. And a good choice if you're only ever going to invest in one album by Leonard.

0385341067|3.0|Lloyd Jones' \\"Mr Pip\\" has all the good intentions in the right place, and this is the biggest problem of the novel. His subject is very interesting indeed. A simple girl's life being changed by her love for books. It has the heart one would expect to such a material, but it hasn't the profundity one would want. Jones' narrative is simple and predictable once you get where he is leading to. He also thrust in easy tears replacing wit sometimes, what is really sad, since he has so many good moments. As we all know, \\"Mr Pip\\" is one more brick in the road to hell.

B000H0MKOC|2.0|First off, I have to tell you that I enjoyed nearly everything about the first 2/3rds of this movie. Funny, dark, funny and dark (the MOD [Merchants of Death] Squad!); pointed in its exposition of rampant hypocrisy from the movers and shakers of our society, the media, unquestioning minds... And then, then....<br /><br />...off the cliff the movie falls in the latter third as it attempts to make a sociopathological liar into some sort of a \\"hero\\" -- a hero who in the final scene proudly offers to buy his son a pack of cigarettes if he desires to use his god given freedom of choice to do so when of legal age. WTF?<br /><br />Look, I buy the libertarian philosophy of informed consent to do whatever one will sans harm to others when one is an adult, but trying to make the protagonist sympathetic simply because he's just doing what he's good at (i.e., talking/spinning) and pointing out that such behavior is rampant does not a good fable make.<br /><br />satire / noun<br />the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices...<br /><br />The pointed and deserved satire aimed at people who appear to be willfully unconcerned about the consequences of their duplicity doesn't extend to the main character... Don't sweat the conscious double-speak and lies, these are not vices as far as this movie is concerned -- just use your head to make \\"informed\\" choices. An attitude that turns an otherwise enjoyable wickedly-funny satire into a disappointing slab of cynicism and a glorification of amoral intellectualism.<br /><br />To those of you who enjoy cynicism or who can otherwise ignore it, 4 stars.
B000YABYLA|4.0|Academy Award Best Picture nominee Juno is a quirky, cute comedy. I never once laughed out loud yet found the story of the pregnant teenage girl looking for a home for her baby to be perfectly enjoyable. This movie generated a lot of buzz and did quite well at the box office. I don't know if it ranks as one of the best pictures of the year (it was much better than Michael Clayton), but this is a fun movie that you should check out. Due to language and adult themes, it probably isn't for young kids.<br /><br />Juno is played by Ellen Page. Page is perfect as the 16-year old junior stunned by the shocking news she is pregnant. Juno is witty, sarcastic, extremely intelligent and passionate about life. She is also very vulnerable, and it shows during the times that her plans don't work out. Like getting pregnant, for example. She tries to deal with it on her own and seeks out a family planning center that doesn't require parental consent. Abortion is a controversial issue, but in a teen pregnancy movie, it had to be dealt with. The movie deals with it and gets it out of the way as quickly as possible. With the help of the one friend that sticks with her, Juno plans to find a couple to adopt her baby. She believes she has found the perfect couple in Vanessa and Mark Loring (played by Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman). Vanessa longs to have kids, but can't, and Mark is very laid back and at times more interested in classic rockn'roll. This is a strange couple and some of the best scenes are between Page and Bateman.<br /><br />The movie is backed by a great soundtrack. Diablo Cody's screenplay keeps you tuned to the screen. Juno's dad, played by JK Simmons, is very supportive of his daughter. Michael Cera plays the father of the child, Beeker. He loves Juno, but their relationship changes because of the pregnancy. Because the issue of teen pregnancy is somewhat idealized, this movie is sort of a fairy tale. Still, I really liked this movie. Finally, an oscar nominee that wasn't too pretentious for regular movie goers to enjoy.entious for regular movie goers to enjoy.

0385340559|3.0|Let me be frank right from jump - I love Jack Reacher. I love the character, I love the stories. I love Lee Child's writing style. He's an amazing storyteller and his prose cracks with intensity. It's terse, nail-biting stuff. Hard Luck and Trouble does not disappoint in the writing department. It is all of the above and then some.<br /><br />Unfortunately, a lot of it is wrong.<br /><br />First, the basic plot-<br /><br />Reacher is contacted by one of his old unit, requesting help. Reacher's old unit, it appears, are disappearing one by one. Then they start turning up dead. Someone has to do something because \\"You don't mess with the Special Investigators.\\" But someone did, and Reacher and his surviving part of the unit is going to make them pay. Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, Vegas casinos, possible Islamic terrorists, and some cops - it makes for a volatile mix. And Reacher is just the guy to make the whole thing blow up.<br /><br />Even in fiction, however, the story has to follow an internal logic. Reacher's stories, more often than not, have a fatal flaw or two written in them. Bad Luck and Trouble has more than a few.<br /><br />We start with Reacher buying a one-way ticket, in cash, and then flying through an airport without having to go through the extra security screening someone buying such a ticket, with cash, would automatically earn (SSSS). Imagine if you were a security person and you get a guy like Reacher, flying with no bags, no checked luggage, nothing. Any halfway competent person would know there was something interesting here. Reacher would get the third degree.<br /><br />We move onto a guy risking carrying a special knife and knuckles through airport security when he could just check it in his checked luggage. Why risk it? Imaginary Homeland Security records and checks that don't exist. Cop training that involves running around with no round in the chamber of the pistol (there is no such training). Pistols carrying more rounds in them than they do. People blowing things up and shooting and leaving evidence with their fingerprints all over things, yet no one finds them? No record checks? People snapping adult necks with one hand (no human on earth can do this). One armed chokes. It's all too ridiculous.<br /><br />These factors may be aggravating to some and irrelevant to others, but when something is integral to the plot then the whole structure falls apart if the thing in question is impossible or doesn't exist. This happens too often in Reacher novels. Supposed clues that can't occur in the real world are used to move the story along. One has to suspend disbelief too much and that weakens the story. Which is, again, unfortunate because the writing really is top shelf. Most people would probably not notice or, if they did, not know how things work in the really real world. Professionals in the field (and a lot of us read Reacher novels) will and do.<br /><br />The writing in Bad Luck and Trouble is all that I hoped it would be. I will continue to buy Reacher's story, because it's entertaining and well written. If Mr. Child would only do some research to smooth up some of the egregious errors it would be some of the best thriller work on the market. It's writing already is. Just do some due diligence and then it will earn the highest marks. Mr. Child just needs someone to tell him that he can make a book accurate and still be exciting and suspenseful. He can pull it off. He's one of the few suspense authors out there that doesn't need to resort to tricks. Reacher would demand that honesty. I just know it.<br /><br />Recommended, but with reservations.up and shooting and leaving evidence with their fingerprints all over things, yet no one finds them? No record checks?

B001794FOK|5.0|I got excited the moment I saw the jumper trailer!  The story looked cool yet I was prepared for a letdown at the theaters because of the stupid \\"super-hero\\" feel I got from the trailer.  I was amazed how good it was, and it totally did not feel like some rip-off super-hero flick.  The acting was perfect along with the effects.  The romance was sweet and short, with an amazing twist at the end.  It did feel like there was something small missing at the end and made me realize they probably will make a second movie (which I hope never comes).  Jumper is perfect the way it is.  I could be wrong a second could be great.  I just don't want something to ruin this one.    I truly cant believe what the ratings on here are...  This is one of my top ten favorite movies of all time!  Most of my friends agree and loved it.  Comedy, Sci-fi, Romance, and action all not going too far.    This will be on my dvd shelf forever!  Check it out.
B00004VWAF|5.0|Miles Davis-On The Corner *****<br /><br />I honestly can't understand what was so controversial about this album upon it's initial release, and why it doesn't have a five star rating. For me personally it doesn't get any better then this. I honestly think this is my all time favorite Miles Davis album. Sure I love Kind Of Blue, and it is easily a better album then this, and is maybe the greatest album of all time, but for me personally this is my favorite, then Sketches Of Spain, then Kind Of Blue.<br /><br />The instrumentation on this is the most experimental that Davis ever got, and the most experimental that he ever let his band become. His use of the wah-wah pedal (meant for guitar) on his trumpet is amazing. Herbie Hancock shines like he never did before here, and John McLaughlin just completely owns with his guitar work.<br /><br />From what I have gathered from reading his autobiography called Miles, On The Corner was inspired by James Brown, Sly Stone, and Jimi Hendrix (as was Bitches Brew, though that wasn't as good as this) and especially the four pieces that make up the first track on the album. 'On The Corner/New York Girl/Thinkin Of One Thing And Doin Another/Vote For Miles' is flat out breathtaking, as is the whole album. Now had this been released by any other artist I could understand the controversy, but Miles had always been known to change styles at the drop of a hat, and create new ones equally as fast. The cover art is no more controversial than that of Bitches Brew, and his attitude was always the same, so to me it seems like just another great Miles effort.<br /><br />This is really the Miles Davis album for rock fans, even more so then Brew in my opinion.
B000GUJYLU|5.0|A young french girl's father dies after being newly wed, and leaves his daughter to be raised by the hard women with her two spoiled daughters.  Sound familiar?  It is; it is Cinderella.  In this version, the main character is a loud mouthed tomboy who has a kind, generous, and loving heart.  Fate would have it that she meets the crown prince of France while saving one of her servants from being sent away to America, and the seeds of love or at least curiosity are sown.<br /><br />  \\"Everafter\\" is one of those rare movies that actually transcends to material that is based off of.  Cinderella, at its heart, like many of the Grimms Fairytales, is not a love story, but a morality tale.  That is what folk tales are, morality in story form.  With this in mind, \\"Everafter\\" does not go for the morality tale, but the love story with morality undertones.<br /><br />  What makes \\"Everafter\\" unique is that is has a great cast and message behind it.  The story, of course, is completely predictable, but the script is dramatic but peppered with a great sense of humor!  The principle message of the movie is that in for a relationship to work, you must be honest, and hiding things only makes the situation worse.  It also highlights that true love is not perfect, and that in love, we must learn to forgive many times.  One of my favorite scenes is the one after the ball between Prince Henry and Divinci.  This shows how the movie treads the line between love at first sight and making the choice to love.<br /><br />  Is this a realistic movie?  Absolutely not.  Would you watch a movie about Cinderella and expect realism?  I would hope not.<br /><br />  The only thing I would change is the DVD.  There are no extras except a trailer, which is not an extra.  So, where is the special anniversary edition with cast interviews/documentaries on the film and director/cast commentaries???  That is what all of us want!  Please Fox, pay attention we want more than a bare bones DVD!!!  That is my only complaint, and it is not about the movie itself, which is no doubt, a five star movies.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amynly complaint, and it is not about the movie itself, which is no doubt, a five star movies.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy
B0000700KQ|4.0|In 2001, David Lynch (director of [[ASIN:B0007PAMR4 Dune]] and creator of [[ASIN:B000UX6THK Twin Peaks]]) released a complex mystery film that defied the genre rules and mystified audiences. So what's it about?    The film starred Naomi Watts, in an outstanding performance, as a seemingly naïve and innocent young actress who stumbles upon a car crash victim with amnesia, played by Laura Elena Harring. The two befriend one another and begin to search for clues to the haunted woman's past. Meanwhile a rebellious young director is being told who to recast as the female lead in his next film but when he refuses, strange things begin to happen. Before long their lives cross paths and all who encounter them are affected.    The film unfolds into a delirium of complex schemes, startling eroticism and complete insanity. But it keeps its viewers interested, though it never truly explains itself. Many people have attempted to unravel the film's meaning (there are quite a few interesting theories suggested by other reviewers). Some say that it's about the dream of a psychotic woman on the verge of committing suicide. Others say it's an allegory for the corruptive nature of the Hollywood lifestyle. There have even been some who feel that the whole film is just an epic mindf**k, which wouldn't be that surprising coming from an iconoclast like David Lynch. But what is surprising is that most people will admit that they don't fully understand it, and yet they can't get enough of it. Perhaps its popularity can be attributed to the complex plot, or the brilliant acting, or maybe the raw sesuality of Naomi Watts' performance. Whatever the appeal may be, there's no doubt about it, Mulholland Dr. is a provocative, titillating  and mesmerizing trip that you have to experience for yourself. Maybe even more than once.

B000VXLC3K|5.0|Unlike the other two reviewers who have posted here so far, I do not own the 1999 remaster of \\"Tapestry\\", so I have no problems with this incarnation.  I do own the \\"Natural Woman\\" 2-cd set, which contains the entire album, and the sound on this edition is far superior.  There's a lot more depth and clarity.  But the main reason for my buying this was to hear the second CD of live versions.  It's really amazing to hear these songs accompanied by Carole's piano only.  It makes you realize that when you have songs this strong melodically and lyrically, you don't need a lot of frills added.  I have one minor complaint--they list four concerts that the songs were taken from, but they don't specify which songs are from which concerts.  I was in attendance at the 1973 Central Park concert, so I'd be interested to know what songs were included from that classic show.  But that's a minor quibble.  This is a wonderful edition of a landmark moment in pop music, and at such a reasonable price, it's well worth the investment.  Carole's soulful and heartfelt singing is always welcome to these ears.  Hey Sony, how about releasing newly remastered versions of Carole's other albums?  : )
B0015HOFZI|5.0|The reason that I wrote this review is because when this product was new I could not find a single review on this turntable before I purchased it. I had been shopping for a turntable for quite awhile, reading reviews and product specs until I finally decided on the PS-LX300USB mostly for its appearance, price, USB capabilities and the Sony name. I've had this turntable for several years now and I am still very pleased with its performance.<br /><br />Here's what I like about this turntable:<br />Great sound that in my opinion equals a number of CD recordings of the same music; USB connection that easily allows conversion of analog music to digital files; The MP3s that I made sound good. It is black and blends in well with my other stereo equipment and doesn't look like a bloated silver flying saucer (like some other USB turntables); Easy to operate; Price is great; Software works pretty good once you figure out how it operates.<br /><br />As for my opinion of its shortcomings: I've owned this turntable for years now and there are a number of other turntables out there with equal or better features to consider. The plastic construction has a light cheap look. The software instructions in the manual will lead you to select a \\"record\\" option that will prevent you from hearing the audio as you record it. This was a little annoying until I found the \\"Vinyl Recording\\" feature under one of the drop down menus at the top of the screen.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />It does the job for a great price but there are other turntables with more features to consider for not too much more money. I still recommend it.

B00000IGGA|5.0|Tom Waits-Mule Variations *****<br /><br />Mule Variations just might be Waits' all time best album, it certainly is his best since Rain Dogs. I say this because I don't feel that since Rain Dogs has he covered as much ground as he did with Mule Variations to this level of quality. This is both a very dark and hallow album, and yet a sort of positive and up-lifting album all at the same time. The lyrical content is amazing, both Waits and his wife Kathryn have done a fabulous job here. The musicianship, though mostly from the guys in Primus is remarkably fresh, considering the odd instrumentation.<br /><br />Songs like the albums opener, 'Big In Japan' show the hilarity in Waits' music that fans have come to know over the years, while the minimalistic 'Lowside Of The Road' and 'Get Behind The Mule' show his stories of the downtrodden will always have a place in his heart of hearts. The Spoken jazz of 'Whats He Building?' is classic, while for me personally, 'Eyeball Kid' marks new ground for Waits.<br /><br />Whats especially notable about Mule Variations is Waits' vocals. Still as raspy as ever, his method of recording on this album is astounding, I'm not sure as to how it did it but he sounds as though he is singing with his head in a plastic bucket, and it adds to the overall feel of the album.<br /><br />Mule Variations is like a crop maze, in that every time you enter, no matter what route you take you end up in a different place each time, no matter if you take the same route over, and over. This is a refreshing album even a near ten years after it's original release in 1999. Which by the way, Mule Variations easily has my vote for the best album of the 1990's.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Excellent documentary, I've yet to find time to watch it all, but what I've seen of it has been wonderful.

B000R8YC1I|5.0|So begins Jim Henson's 1982 masterpiece The Dark Crystal, an amazing fantasy film that primarily uses puppets as its main characters. The Dark Crystal is perhaps the [[ASIN:B0009ULBGS Muppet]] creator's most thoughtful endeavor and is a must-see for all fans of fantasy films or for fans of Jim Henson. The level of detail and the precision of the artistry that went into this film is a testament to what a great filmmaker can do, and Jim Henson was (and still is) a great filmmaker.    The story concerns Jen, a Gelfling, who must save his planet by restoring the legendary Dark Crystal, which must be done before the three suns of his planet meet in the Great Conjunction. If he fails chaos and destruction shall reign eternal. He begins his mission after his mentor, the wisest of the Mystics, dies. To a young Gelfling like Jen, the world seems an enormous and strange place. He encounters numerous dangers but finally reaches the home of the ancient being known as Aughra. Aughra gives Jen the crystal shard that he seeks, but the forces of evil invade her home and Jen has to flee before she can tell him anymore about his task. Meanwhile the cruel Skeksis are hunting Jen, for it is prophesized that a Gelfling will bring about their doom. But Jen finds an ally in Kira, the only other living Gelfling to survive the Skeksis' slaughter of their race years before. Jen and Kira, along with her furry and ferocious pet Fizzgig, set out for the castle of the Skeksis. But can they survive the dangers of the journey and restore balance to their world?    Henson's film (I should also mention that it was co-directed by puppeteer Frank Oz) is a stunning achievement in pre-digital special effects and features a profound philosophical/spiritual undercurrent that has fascinated viewers for over 25 years. The film is exciting, stimulating and perhaps at times too intense for younger children. But overall it's one of the greatest fantasy films ever made!    The 25th Anniversary Edition DVD includes the following special features: a beautiful new high definition film transfer, a new commentary track with conceptual designer Brian Froud, The World of the Dark Crystal vintage documentary, deleted scenes, original work print scenes, character illustrations, the new Light on the Path of Creation & Shard of Illusion documentaries, and previews.

B000RZIGZ4|5.0|Very good portrayal of life on an aircraft carrier, although not enough time actually on board. Graphics are crisp and clear. Too bad HD-DVD is no longer supported. Still one of the best military movies.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|There is something inherently creepy about beauty pageants for young girls. 7 year old girls in high heels, in their bathing suits, with their bigger than their head hairdos and not to mention the balls to the walls make up. I mean honestly whoever thought this was a great idea? That was like every pedophile's Disney Land. But for selfish reasons, I'm glad it exists because otherwise there would be no movie like this that satirizes the absurdity of this whole thing with such charm and heart.    I can actually sum of the movie in one sentence. Crazy family heads to the little miss sunshine pageant! In between states and cities, we get to see the craziness up close and personal. Like how Dad (Kinnear) tries to manipulate our little Olive (Breslin) into hating ice cream so that she won't get fat, or the visual gag of the malfunctioning van (hard to explain, you've got see it), or the non-talking, exercise freak older brother.     Academy Award nominee Abigail Breslin was cute as a button. I was really surprised how good she was because most of the clips that I saw were the scene where she was screaming uncontrollably apparently after hearing that she won the prelimenaries. Her performance as a whole is much better than that, don't be fooled by that useless scene. Steve Carrell showed another side of his comedic range. His performance on \\"The Office\\" was dead on especially in terms of how he was able to find the depth in a very broad and caricaturish character. And just how he consistently developed the nitty gritty of the character. Here in this movie, he is totally believable as the suicidal and reticent brother/uncle. And then there's Alan Arkin who gave the most touching speech ever to his grandaughter about how he thinks she's beautiful inside and out.     The movie appropriately hit its climax in the beauty pageant itself. It was touching when the rest of the family sort of had an \\"aha\\" moment about how this pageant is going to damage this little girl's self-esteem. But our little miss sunshine doesn't care, she wants to honor grandpa (who died during the road trip, BTW). Funniest line ever was when the emcee asked Olive where her grandpa is, her reply: \\"He's in the trunk\\" (literally)! But the absolute funniest scene was when Olive started to do the \\"stripper\\" routine. Apparently that's what grandpa and Olive have been practicing all along. The look on everyone's face was priceless. To offset the scandal, the rest of the family started one by one to join Olive and just lose themselves in the dance. It was sweet and moving at the same time. And of course a crazy way to end this little sunshine of a movie!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I haven't seen them all yet, but the 2 discs that I have watched have some breathtaking scenes. This series covers the breadth of a topic very well.    Of course, since the topics have a lot of breadth they are not able to provide a comprehensive in-depth dive into each of the individual parts of a topic. Nonetheless, each topic is a joy to watch and plenty of new things to learn even for the avid nature enthusiast.    Even if it does not become a collector item, its a keeper.

B00005O3VC|5.0|In 1974 the bad boys of British comedy decided to create a full-length motion picture, which was destined for greatness (or at least mediocrity disguised as greatness). [[ASIN:B00000F6LQ Monty Python and the Holy Grail]] is a totally distasteful classic of almost epic proportions.  The film stars John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Terry Jones, and Terry Gilliam, who not only acts but also serves as the film's co-director and animator. Each member of [[ASIN:B000GEIRSM Monty Python]] is perfect in their (dis)respective roles, but standing out from the others is the late Graham Chapman, who plays King Arthur as the \\"straight character\\". Chapman portrays Arthur as a serious, heroic figure who is completely unaware of his self-satirizing surroundings.    [[ASIN:B000CRQX34 Monty Python and the Holy Grail]] begins with a series of gags involving mock-Swedish subtitles and of all things, moose and llamas. After some of the strangest credits ever, the first scene opens on an epic shot of the mist-shrouded moors of medieval Britain. Two men come galloping heroically into view. What's odd is that neither of them are on horses. In fact, one of them is simply banging two halves of a coconut shell together to simulate the sound of hoof beats. Thus hilarity ensues. The story also includes such memorable characters as an obnoxious French \\"taunter\\", a three-headed knight, an effeminate prince who just wants to sing, a ghastly cartoon monster, and perhaps the most lethal rabbit ever put on film.    What makes the film so bloody funny is the complete lack of respect that it shows to Arthurian legend and medieval folklore. Both Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones (the dementedly brilliant directors and co-stars) are quite familiar with medieval history and delight in lampooning it at every turn. The dialogue is perfectly ridiculous and that's precisely what makes it so entertaining.   I won't go into great detail about the plot (ha-ha-ha!) or the innumerous zany characters other than to say it's absolutely irreverent and mad (something that seems common with the Pythons). Even the ending of the film is intentionally anti-climactic.  But if you want British comedy without restraint, then check out this classic or, \\"I'll wave my private parts at your aunties, you cheesy lot of secondhand, electric-donkey bottom biters!\\"  Oh, and don't forget your coconuts.    The 2-disc Special Edition includes the following special features: an audio commentary by directors and stars Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, an audio commentary by John Cleese, Eric Idle, and Michael Palin, Follow the Killer Rabbit feature, Subtitles for People Who Don't Like the Film (taken from Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part II), On-Screen Screenplay, three Sing-Alongs, The Quest for the Holy Grail documentary, BBC Film Night: On Location with Monty Python and the Holy Grail vintage featurette, two scenes from the Japanese language version of the film, How to Use Your Coconuts instructional featurette, Monty Python and the Holy Grail in Lego short film, extensive image galleries, An Interactive Cast Directory, and theatrical trailers.

B0007M22TI|5.0|I really enjoyed this dvd! Altho the entire production is rather staged and stiff due to all the regimented ways they walk, stand and move - its still very enjoyable to watch. I attended one of their concerts recently and could anticipate their every move. BUT, I LOVE THEIR MUSIC! Cloe has grown up and sounds even better as she is strengthening her voice and style. Its a great family 'movie' that leaves you inspired!
0151013837|5.0|It goes without saying that Life of Pi is my favorite book. Pi and Richard Parker won my heart years ago and I give this book away to everyone I know.<br /><br />When I saw the illustrated version had been released, of course I immediately ordered it and was enthralled at the beautiful paintings and sketches that highlight certain elements of the story. It made re-reading it even more of a joy.<br /><br />It was exactly as my mind had pictured it.<br /><br />Beautiful edition and highly recommended.
B0013FDM7E|2.0|This is a pretty cool story to start with, but two-thirds or so into the movie the plot starts getting pretty \\"holey.\\" Smith's character mentions in his memoirs that the dark seekers are repelled by ultraviolet light. Then where did the \\"ultraviolet\\" light come from when the chick saves him at night by driving off the dark seekers? Her headlights? And of course, his human experiment had a delayed acceptance of his vaccine RIGHT IN THE NICK OF TIME before he could extract the blood out of the human subject and give it to the girl, right before he gave himself up to the creeps. And what makes the rabid humans so freakin' strong? It must me one helluva \\"sickness\\" to make infected victims of it as strong as King Kong, throwing 200 lb. Will Smith around like he was a frisbee. C'mon, guys! Doing that just turns it into a cartoon. I wouldn't have been too surprised for the \\"head\\" dark seeker to snarl \\"After I finish with him, I will RULE THE WORLD! MMHOOOHAHAHAHHAHAHA!!!\\"    So if you don't mind a progressively weakening story line, and are mostly into special effects, you will probably like this movie. Personally, I wasn't too thrilled with it.
B000F9RB8A|5.0|this movie will become a classic i'm sure. it's a really funny movie with excellent special effects.. classic \\"kung fu\\" stuff with a little extra! I love this flick!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Okay, I am not in bad shape- really. I have been going to the gym regularly this year, and lift weights too. I do about 1/2 hour to 40 min on the eliptical and I don't mess around. I decided to try this workout because I was getting tired of the gym and thought I might mix it up. I am 38 years old and within my BMI target. I tried the Level One workout. It was really simple to complete, but it wasn't easy. I'd forgotten how basic jumping jacks could be challenging! I didn't use weights the first time because I wanted to try it out. The workout lasts 20 minutes, give or take, and the workout consists of abs, cardio and strenght. The next morning, I was a MESS. I was sore, but in a good way. My inner thighs ached like never before. As Jillian says, a great body \\"doesn't come for for free!\\" You have to work hard. I did, and I was so sore I couldn't do days 2-4 of the \\"30 Day Shred.\\"  However, I am now getting back on the shred wagon and it is gradually getting easier. I think it is a great workout in a compact package. You can do it anywhere, anytime, and only need handweights (or not!) to get a great workout.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Its best to watch the behind the scenes section of this dvd FIRST. It gives a lot of great background to this presentation. Helps us appreciate the work that went into/goes into it. Its agrivating that these women are still forced to all the 'fake staging' while they are singing. I guess that is done to make sure each of the stars get equal billing, equal face time? Their concert is amazing. The singing is incredible! Everything is so beautiful! Go out to see them if you can - but if you cant, get this dvd (and the previous one too!) and have a Celtic Woman night with your family or friends.
6305428050|4.0|Fun family movie with a lot of action and a bit of romance.    Elisabeth Shue's character agrees to babysit her family friend's kids after having her date cancelled by her so called boyfriend. She thinks it's going to be an easy night babysitting until her friend calls her to pick her up from the train station. She agrees and that's where the action begins. What has she let herself in for?    Gives a new meaning to 'babysitting'
1401308201|5.0|Wicked, the \\"true\\" story of the witches of OZ!  What a wonderful concept and the play is so marvelous in making the story so believable. The book helps you see the underlying story in the Frank Baum, Wizard of OZ. If you haven't seen the play, the book will intrigue you enough to want to see it, again and again.  If you have seen the play, then this book is a wonderful companion. While it has the usual pictures and glossy prints, it also has the script which is superb. The ending is missing from the script, so the play is a must see!!!
B0000009SY|4.0|The best release of this cd so far, it finally has some tone. It could be better but it's better than the original cd release by far.

B0009UC7H0|1.0|Overall, this movie was awful. If they had stuck to the book, it would have been a lot better.<br />Matthew McConaughey is an awful actor. (Heh, Family Guy did a great job of making fun of him recently)<br />Steve Zahn is hilarious however.<br /><br />A shame too, this would have made a great movie.
B00005R5G9|5.0|Love this movie, it's a shame the 2nd one was crap.    Excellent 80's movie about a guy who lands a job working for a Department Store where he meets a mannequin who comes alive.    Great music. Love the dance sequence to the song 'Do you dream about me'    Kim Cattrall & Andrew McCarthy are a great couple. Gay window dresser 'HOLLYWOOD' is funny and fabulous.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|Cloverfield is an interesting movie on many different levels. The movie is postmodern; delighting in pastiche and eclectic borrowing. The intrepid viewer quickly sees the affinity between Cloverfield, the Blair Witch, 1950s monster movies, traditional sci-fi, etc. This is not to be derided; it is to be applauded. There is certainly nothing wrong with using a syncretic blend of influences to create an original movie. I think the po-mo attitude is: \\"Screw it, it has all been done before. We might as well be open about our borrowing.\\"<br />The use of a shaky cam in Cloverfield- alas Blair Witch and Bourne- was a smart move. It creates the intended nausea and vertigo. The psychological state created sets the tone for a fast pased, taut monster movie thriller. On a superficial level, then, the movie is a fairly straighforward and succesful one. No complaints.<br />On a more symbolic level, it seems fairly evident that the movie serves as a Post-9/11 statement on terrorism. The choice of Manhattan was not abitrary. Indeed, the fact that we never see the monster clearly is indicative of terrorism in general: who are we fighting against? Is terrorism as we percieve it even real? Cloverfield seems to be telling us that blind fear of the unknown drives our population to support wars and foreign adventures that might not be in our own interests. Clearly, in the movie, the military option is untenable and actually does more harm than good. Are we doing the same thing in the Middle East? Is creating a nebulous reification called terrorism, and fighting 'it', feasible, or are we just harking back to the days of the red menace? Whether or not the movie intended to be used as a political statement, the parrallelisms are limpid enough. Hey, it is a postmodern era, free readings of texts should be encouraged, right?<br /><br />There is much more to this movie than meets the eye. However, what meets the eye is pretty darned entertaining. Did it live up to the hype? No. There is irony in this. Was the hype not manufactured on purpose through various media outlets: the internet, TV, radio, etc.? Are these not the same mediums that hype the \\"War on Terror?\\" Are either worthy of the hype? I do not think so. Do you think the people hyping this movie were not aware of this? I think they were clever enough to show us just how powerful the media is in our day.hype not manufactured on purpose through various media outlets: the internet, TV, radio, etc.?

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is actually  a very difficult workout.  I was initially disappointed that each sesssion was 20 minutes in length, but l0 minutes into the level 1 session, I am working hard.  I have begun to do level 1 and level 2 to create a 40 minute session. I have yet to attempt level 3.  Jillian does inspire.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I think that this video is a great cardio and strength work-out.  My students love working out to it.
B000B7QCKE|5.0|While this was my first exposure to Yanni back in 1994, I have become a dedicated listener to all of his works!  He is simply one of the most extraordinary performers/composers of our age!  I was privileged to see him in concert in Tucson, AZ in l995 and it left me breathless.  If I sound like a \\"groupie\\" I am not, but I simply love the breadth & scope of his musical talents.
B00005JPNY|1.0|This is a boring, hard to follow, knockoff of The Chronicles of Narnia.  Wait till it comes on TV and watch it for free.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|If I had known this was shot in the Blair Witch style of camera work I wouldn't have hought it.  I couldn't get through 15 minutes of it.  The handheld camera work made me nauseous.  I expect to see this dud in the 2 for $10 bin at WalMart very soon.
0060566108|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book very much. It seems the company and the organization as an organic system within a larger system, and which purpose is not simply to make money (although, companies managed this way always do). It brings also the importance of the human side into management and how important it is to have a solid system of core values, beliefs, principles and mission. I highly recommended together with Good To Great, even in spite of the fact that some of the covered companies (like Ford, Sony, and Motorola) not being able to keep their greatness consistently.<br /><br />30/Jul/2009 Update: One can not read this book in the right context and perspective without reading [[ASIN:0743291263 The Halo Effect: ... and the Eight Other Business Delusions That Deceive Managers]] - so far the best business book I've ever read!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|This movie did a great job of wrapping up the Ori storyline left hanging after seasn 10 of the series. The optional recap feature was wonderful for those of us who own all 10 seasons but have forgotten some of the basic facts. There was one part of the movie that reminded me of the season 8 episode Threads, you'll know it when you see it. With all of the allies of Earth who own spaceships, any new threat should have a tough time getting close enough to attack.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|This is good metal. Melodic, meaningful, and realistic. I can relate to the angst and am thankful for the restraint. I'd feel completely comfortable turning my young nieces and nephews on to this. As a matter of fact, I think I will.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|The Movie Itself: Our Reviewer's Take       Celine Dion is the one musical artist on this planet that I love to hate more than any other. For me, her multi-octave voice, while technically impressive, is the equivalent of nails on a chalkboard. Add to that her zillion-selling albums stuffed with Ready Whip-tunes by songwriters-for-hire, and an utter sincerity as a live performer that makes irony seem like a four-letter word, and Dion is a hilarious spectacle to witness. Blissfully unaware of her own cheesiness, and blessed with a stage persona that makes Napoleon Dynamite seem graceful, Celine is about as cool as Barry Manilow, Engelbert Humperdinck, and Lawrence Welk all rolled into one.     Which is of course why I'm always riveted whenever she's on the screen. Watching her perform in 'A New Day... Live in Las Vegas' (a visually breathtaking document of her legendary five-year run at the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace) is like watching someone with Tourette Syndrome sing with the voice of a dove. Her routine goes something like this: she makes some bizarre facial expression, launches into a spastic high-kick, then feigns a bit of rock air guitar (Slash, watch out!), before topping it off with a camera-ready pose, legs spread eagle, as if she suddenly needs to take a dump onstage. If only Celine wasn't so damn gracious and sincere about it all (\\"I want to dedicate this song to all the parents and children of the world!\\" she says at one point, which I guess includes everyone on the planet), I'd say she needs to book a one-way ticket to the cuckoo's nest along with Courtney Love.     Luckily, Celine the awkward entertainer is surrounded by such a spectacle of costume, dance, and electronic visuals in 'A New Day...' that she doesn't have to bear all of the burden on her pointy little shoulders. As conceived by Dragone (better known as the \\"visionary\\" behind the Cirque du Soleil phenomenon), it's such an utterly ludicrous combination of pretentious performance art, bad musical dinner theater, and bland musicianship that it's like a car crash you can't turn away from, but secretly think is half-good. There is talent on display here to be sure, but it's also so absolutely devoid of any hint of self-awareness that the result is grand, grand camp of the highest caliber.     What's so riveting about 'A New Day...' is that since Celine has never been an artist who seems to exhibit any personal direction over her career, every moment of her show -- like every manufactured note on her albums -- is predetermined by a higher power. In this case, it's Dragone, who stages each song like it's some sort of post-apocalyptic battle for Celine's soul.     The \\"themes\\" of each number are inspired in their insanity. What to make of \\"Seduces Me,\\" which features a cavalcade of writhing, half-naked male dancers (apparently on unemployment since Madonna's Blonde Ambition tour circa 1990), who look like a bunch of hungry zombies who don't so much want to make love to Celine as eat her? Or the towering \\"To Love You More,\\" where the projection of Celine's twitchy mug is beamed upon the ginormous LED screen that covers the back of the stage, complete with flames and thundering lighting effects -- it's Celine as Godzilla, and had I been sitting in the audience, I would have feared for my life. Last, but not least, there is of course \\"My Heart Will Go On,\\" which Dragone re-imagines as some sort of intergalactic mash-up of 'Titanic' and '2001: A Space Odyssey,' complete with giant moon backdrop and an Asian version of Kate Winslet floating suspended across the stage in a giant white wedding dress.     All of this is, of course, massively entertaining. Just the sheer size and scope of this thing is impressive, no matter how much you may hate the music. Celine doesn't perform on any mere stage, of course, but on a mammoth platform that looks as if the Mothership from 'Close Encounters' is going to land at any moment. There is also so much going on at any one moment (Giant video screens! A zillion dancers! Enough smoke for a good-sized forest fire! Celine taking a dump!) that it's impossible to be bored. I just enjoyed watching the over-arching visual madness of it all, even if I understood not a lick of its appeal.     My only real reservation with 'A New Day...' is that I'm not sure if it is the best iteration of the Celine's five-year-spanning run at the Colosseum. The production underwent some tinkering over the years, including various setlist changes, and I'm not sure it was improved along the way. The show I saw live about three years ago seemed to flow a bit better, and also had a more fitting final encore than 'My Heart Will Go On' (which, for some odd reason, ends the show on an anti-climactic note here), but no matter, as any Team Celine member will certainly cherish 'Live in Las Vegas' as a vivid document of what just may prove to be her career zenith as a live performer. Whether or not that is a compliment, I'll leave up to you...     The complete tracklist includes: 01. A New Day Has Come / 02. The Power Of Love / 03. It's All Coming Back To Me Now / 04. Because You Loved Me / 05. To Love You More / 06. I'm Alive / 07. I Drove All Night / 08. Seduces Me / 09. If I Could / 10. Pour Que Tu M'Aimes / 11. I Surrender / 12. Ammore Annascunnuto / 13. All The Way / 14. I've Got The World On A String / 15. I Wish / 16. Love Can Move Mountains / 17. River Deep, Mountain High / 18. My Heart Will Go On       The Video: Sizing Up the Picture       Sony BMG has been the most consistent distributor of music titles on high-def (on either format), and they once again hit it out of the park with 'Celine Dion: A New Day... Live in Las Vegas.' This is a stellar 1080p/VC-1 encode, with the kind of you-are-there, picture perfect quality that screams demo disc.     Captured with multiple HD cameras, the explosion of color, light, and costume that is 'A New Day...' is tailor-made for Blu-ray. Colors are exquisite -- deep, rich, bold and perfectly saturated with no chroma noise or smearing. Blacks are pure and contrast is excellent, resulting in a level of detail and depth that is truly stunning. 'Live in Las Vegas' also excels in terms of shadow delineation, which is always a true test for shot-on-HD live recordings as they often breakdown into fuzziness and artifacts. No such problems here -- this one is a true winner.    Note that my 'New Day' was almost spoiled when I thought I noticed some pixel break-up and noise in some of the large background images. However, I soon realized that as Celine is often framed in front of the gigantic LED screen that flanks the rear of the stage, I was seeing some blockiness in the actually projections themselves, which is not a fault of the transfer. Have no doubt, 'Live in Las Vegas' is a five-star affair through-and-through.       The Audio: Rating the Sound       'Live in Las Vegas' again scores a home run with dual Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround and uncompressed PCM 2.0 Stereo tracks, both at 96kHz/24-bit, and both breathtaking. I swear, when Celine hit (and held) those high notes, there were times I thought my speakers were going to explode.    I really can't pick a favorite between the PCM and TrueHD (despite the lack of 5.1 on the PCM), as both deliver the kind of goose bump-inducing aural experience of only the best high-resolution live music soundtracks. Celine's vocals and the instrumentation have that transparent, utterly palpable sense of realism that makes it seem as if the music is floating around the room and no longer emanating from a set of speakers.     Timbre, attenuation, fidelity and clarity are all simply exquisite. The highs are warm and rich, and even the sharpest notes that Celine hits never sound too brittle (such sterility is a criticism often leveled at her music). Dynamics are also perfectly modulated. Bass is strong and impactful, but not overpowering. As you would expect, Celine's voice is very prominent in the mix, but not at the expense of her backing -- the elements simply flow together perfectly.    If there is any room for complaint, it is that perhaps the mix makes too little use of the rears. However, the crowd at Caesar's Palace is simply a dull, lifeless one -- Celine crowds are hardly the same raucous group you'd find at a Metallica gig -- so this is a front-heavy mix. I'm not going to fault this Blu-ray for that, as it's a Celine show, and this is about as perfect a sonic reproduction of it as I could imagine.       The Supplements: Digging Into the Good Stuff       'Celine Dion: A New Day... Live in Las Vegas' comes to Blu-ray in a package much more impressive than I expected. Housed in a very elegant fold-out keepcase, there is a considerable amount of documentary material here spread over two full Blu-ray discs -- this is no chintzy Blu-ray/DVD combo that you often get with music discs. Add to that a neat 40-page collectible booklet (which includes liner notes and lyrics to all of the songs performed during the show), plus all of the video-based extras presented in full 1080p/VC-1 video, and this is a strong supplemental presentation. (Note: Subtitle options on all of the included documentary material include English, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Chinese, Korean, Thai and Portuguese.)     Documentary: \\"Tribute to the Fans \\" (HD, 41 minutes) - Okay, these people are freaks... but they're nice freaks. The DVD producers behind 'Live in Las Vegas' paid to fly in a cross-section of over two dozen diehard Celine fans from all around the world to one of her shows at Caesar's Palace, and the resulting travelogue is a psychologist's dream. These people act as if they are meeting God herself, but to Dion's credit, she's always gracious, even when confronted by insanity that borders on dangerous obsession. Eeek!        Documentary: \\"A New Day: All Access\\" (HD, 120 minutes) - A very cool behind-the-scenes look at the entire conception and production of 'A New Day...' I know, I'm using thewords \\"Celine\\" and \\"cool\\" in the same paragraph, but this is such an utterly thorough, intimate, and well-paced look at the show that I can't imagine any Dion fan being disappointed. Even more unique, it actually presents the entire concert over again -- the doc is paced in \\"real time,\\" so as the show progresses song-by-song, we are taken beneath the stage and behind the scenes, to see how the \\"magic\\"is created. Even if you hate Celine, you'll likely find \\"All Access\\" quite fascinating.        Documentary: \\"A New Day: The Secrets\\" (HD, 53 minutes) - In some ways, I found this perhaps the most insightful of all the docs on the disc, because the sheer magnitude of the production can't help but impress. Here, we learn all about how they did some the legitimately wow-inducing tricks during the show, such as making various dancers fly without the appearance of wires, as well as seamlessly blending the on-set props with the gigantic LED screen behind the stage. Pretty neat.          HD Bonus Content: Any Exclusive Goodies in There?       There are no high-def exclusives.         Final Thoughts       'Celine Dion: A New Day... Live in Las Vegas' is simply critic-proof. If you love Celine, you'll absolutely love this spectacle, and if you hate her, well... you'll probably hate her even more after watching 90 minutes of her earth-shattering warble. This Blu-ray is simply flawless, however. The video, the audio, the extras -- it's a perfect package and a virtual love letter to fans. Team Celine, this Blu-ray is for you!
0767020308|2.0|This version of Emma doesn't begin to capture the essence of the heroine, Emma. Jane Austen's Emma, while possessing some inbred snobbery, is still a highly likable, innocent character who develops and matures as the story moves. The Emma in this adaptation is not only snobby, she's boring and seriously lacking qualities to make her even likable. The whole video lacks the lightheartedness Jane Austen infused in her book and which the Gwyneth Paltrow version captured so beautifully. If you liked the book, get the Gwyneth Paltrow & Jeremy Northam version instead, and save yourself a lot of disappointment.

Not up to par with the classics like the Godfather series, ONce Upon A Time in AMerica, Goodfellas, etc.<br /><br />Washington delivers a solid performance.

1402590407|5.0|Alexandra Fuller tells a story about growing up in farms in Zimbabwe as it became independent and then in Malawi as her parents worked to make a living among expats and natives.  She went to a white school which emptied out of the white students at independence and then filled with the black children of the neighborhood.  They had a servant who was a gifted tracker.  She was invited into the home of a very poor black family.  As a child she was able to see and do things the adults couldn't.  Alexandra has a wonderful recall of the details of childhood.  Lisette Lecat has a perfectly clear and delightful voice with a British accent that makes hearing the details a pleasure.
B00006DEF9|5.0|Ah, the good old days of true talent and clean entertainment. I remember my father talking about this movie, and finally my husband and I got to see it. It was so good that we let our 9 and 6 year old daughters watch it with us as they each play the piano and violin respectively. They love old movies, and this has turned out to be their favorite. We hysterically laugh through most of it, appreciate the music and dancing, and our girls have even memorized some of the lines from the movie as they imitate the character Lena. This is a \\"must have\\" for a family collection of dvds. A classic musical comedy!
B00004SW9R|5.0|There's absolutely nothing else out there like this one.  Swampy and funky psychedelic voodoo gumbo music with chanting background vocals, mandolin, clarinet, tribal percussion, harpsichord, organ, and an odd and bizarre arrangement of instruments which creates a strange and smoky nocturnal atmosphere like a ritual under a full moon on a hot summer night in the bayou jungle.  Dr. John Creaux, the Night Tripper, is the &quot;Grand Zombie&quot;, our sort of Halloween guide on this after hours voyage which can be a party of the weirdest kind as well as an equal parts earthy and eerie head trip.  Give it a spin.  Your record collection will never be the same.

B000JK8OYU|5.0|We went to Vegas to see this show, it was amazing. The way the music is put together is great(hey you can't complain with anything Paul and Ringo do.)  This CD was offered at the show for $30 and amazon was offering it for less than $10.  What a savings!
B0011ZNAIC|3.0|We found this movie to have good, simple messages that teach children how to be more aware of the environment and how there are consequences for actions and that things are connected. We really like how it is put across in a fun way. The only thing we did not appreciate much was the romantic allusions between the bee and the human lady - if it were more of a friendship that was suggested, we wouldn't mind. Does everything have to have romance in it - even children's movies? The ending of the movie was a nice surprize and made up for the minor disappointment of the romance stuff. Overall, a nice movie.
B0013V33DG|4.0|It's hard to write about this Covent Garden production without comparing it to the Teatro Carlo Felice production from 2005 which is also on DVD and features Juan Diego Florez. (In fact, both productions are updated to one of our 20th Century \\"World Wars,\\" this one to WWI, the Teatro Carlo Felice production to WWII.) So, I'll compare the two since some readers may just want to buy one of them. I gave the other five stars and this one four, but I wouldn't make the choice on that basis alone. If you want to see what played at The Met in the spring of 2008, or if Natalie Dessay is one of your favorite performers, this is the DVD to buy.<br /><br />Juan Diego Florez sings spectacularly in both productions. In this production, he does not encore \\"Ah, mes amis,\\" so you'll have to do with just nine of his thrillingly precise high C's. However, I think he's more relaxed at Covent Garden, having added two years to his onstage experience.<br /><br />Patrizia Ciofi of the Teatro Carlo Felice production cannot compete with Natalie Dessay as a comic actress. Beverly Sills called the role of Marie, \\"Lucille Ball with high notes.\\" That describes Dessay's performance perfectly. Her high notes are indeed the highlight of her singing and her comic antics are a delight to watch. As I wrote in my review of the Teatro Carlo Felice production, Ciofi is not a natural comedienne. But, in my opinion, Ciofi has the superior voice; it is fuller, more varied in tone and more textured. She creates a more operatic Marie.<br /><br />The Teatro Carlo Felice production gives the relationship between Sulpice and the Marquise a flirtatious turn. It adds a lot to their otherwise rather dull roles (dull compared to other supporting roles in Donizetti comedies, such as Dr. Dulcamara and Giannetta in \\"L'Elisir d'Amore\\").<br /><br />Finally, the Teatro Carlo Felice production comes with a second DVD devoted to behind-the-scenes material that is as good as it gets. (I describe it in detail in my review of the Teatro Carlo Felice production.)<br /><br />There are several reasons you might prefer this production to the Teatro Carlo Felice of 2005 even though I think the other is of higher quality overall. First, the Covent Garden production is the same production and the same cast (except for the speaking role of the Duchess of Crackentorp) that played at The Met this spring and was shown in movie theaters around the world. So, if you want to see that Met production, this is the DVD to buy. (Of course, Covent Garden features a different chorus, orchestra, and conductor.) Secondly, if you love Natalie Dessay, I recommend this production over Teatro Carlo Felice.<br /><br />I thought the Teatro Carlo Felice production had more to offer: the encored \\"Ah, mes amis,\\" the superior singing of Patrizia Ciofi, the delightful relationship that develops between Sulpice and the Marquise, and finally, that bonus DVD. You can't go wrong with either production.tion.)

B000LPI68W|5.0|The Professional represents a very rare synthesis of heartfelt drama with searing action with emotional undercurrents.

6305428050|5.0|One of those movies that is easy to watch many times. The plot is simple and almost-believable; A babysitter gets in deep trouble while taking the kids out in an unauthorized rescue mission of a run-away friend.  The cast plays well within their rolls, from the innocent child to the obnoxious teen. It is very entertaining and time goes by very fast.

B000AOEMXM|2.0|When this show first came out, I expected it to be a sort of retro-styled homage to the original series. Instead, I was bored by the steady diet of bland-looking, uninteresting villains, bizarre time warps, etc. and just wanted something a little more solid and original, which would have better continuity within the Trek universe. Also, I think I wanted Captain Archer to be a little more like Captain Kirk, who certainly would not have taken a shower with Lt. T'pol and then not even attempted to do anything more! Being a major fan of the original Trek, therefore, I actually became more interested in this show just before they cancelled it because they started going back to the basics and bringing back old characters like the Romulans, Andorians, etc. Too bad the show couldn't be saved in time, however.<br /><br />P.S. Since this show was in essence supposedly a prequel to TOS, it probably could have actually benefited by ditching some of the sleek, 21st Century production values and making the ship, as well as the planets they visit, a bit more gritty and cheesy looking, thus satisfying the nostalgic cravings of us old-time Trekkers who grew up with TOS. Maybe also have the captain cut loose a little and get naked with an alien babe or two in a moment of madness? If only someone could convince the folks at Paramount to do something like that now!  :-)

I got this DVD on Saturday April 26 and started it that night, WOW I have done workout DVD's but never really felt the workout the way I do with this one. My 8 and 6 year old sons are begging to do it with me, it looks easy but it is a workout, I recommend this to anyone who needs a new workout. My body is killing me and soo soo sore and I didnt want to do the workout this morning because I was sore but I made it through!!!
B00008GKEG|5.0|I remember in the 80's the vhs documentary called \\"The comlpete Beatles\\" which was only two hours. then in 1995 we had the privilege of seeing the the three night documentary of Anthology which wetted our lips a bit , especially with new Beatle songs to come with it. So I hev been in  a Beatles faze recently ,so after two years of thinking about this release , I decided this past Sat. to finally purchase this set on Dvd. I decided to watch a chapter a day so i wouldn't cram it all in and get bored , so that sat night I watched part one of the DVD , then Sunday morning I stared with part two and just kept going because I could not get enough. Now I have finished watching the set , and I still want more.  This is more complete of a history on the band that the actual titled \\"Complete Beatles\\" will ever be. I will cherish this set for as long as I live.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|What is the point of this movie, other than wasting my time? Aside from being an obvious rip-off of, let's see . . . War of the Worlds, Blair Witch, Godzilla, Alien, several video games, and, oh yeah, 9/11 (that's classy), I can't see why this movie was made. There is absolutely NOTHING original in it. The plot is tired and ridiculous. The CGI effects were OK but unremarkable. As far as I can tell, there was no script. But the worst thing about this trainwreck was the complete and utter self-absorption of the gen-x cast, crew, and \\"director.\\" Apparently, everyone in Manhattan is 25, white, and attractive. The only satisfying part of the story is the fact that all of the smug, annoying \\"actors\\" get killed. Ordinarily I would have labeled that comment as a \\"spoiler alert,\\" but this turkey was already rotten before it left the store. And as for the viral marketing campaign . . . who cares? What does that have to do with the quality of the movie? I don't care how they sold this thing -- nice package, but the product sucks.    As a long-time science fiction fan, I've always been interested in alien invasion stories. But watching Cloverfield was the first time I wanted the aliens to win. With movies like this, earth doesn't deserve to survive.

0385733577|3.0|This book is not a great book, but it's not a bad book either. Teen twins Josh and Sophie are working part time jobs right across the street from another and are happily going about their days when they are soon swept up into a world of magic and mayhem they never dreamed existed. I loved the aspect of the author creating fictional characters out of Flamel and Dee, but as one other reviewer mentioned, to title the book the Alchemyst, and then not have much alchemy in the book was very disappointing. If you are a reader who likes non-stop action and lots of cool magic, you'll love this book. But for me I felt it was all flash and bang, one action scene after another that just doesnt stop to take a breath, and in between there was no substance. The characters are well developed and all likeable, however I felt that the bad guy of John Dee, wasnt really a great evil enemy, he was a bit of a wimp if you ask me. He should have been much more terrifying, and like Flamel, he used minions to do his dirty work. In fact, I found both the characters of Dee and Flamel very lame.  The magic used however is very creative and fun and used not in the ways that other YA fantasy stories use it. My major gripe with this book is that the author threw in way too many myths and legends, gods and goddesses and mythical beasts from around the world. It was too much and there were too many. The author had this big stew pot where he just tossed in every legendary myth and creature and then stirred it around and ladled out muck. I think if he had geared the story around one featured myth from one culture, say Norse, or Egyptian, or Celtic, it would have had much more depth to it. We find Egyptian sphinxes and cat goddesses, Excalibur, vampires, Odin, golems and ghosts, Babylonian, stories of Atlantis, Greek, African....it was just too much to throw all these elements in the pot to come out a polished novel. The other thing I found hard to swallow was that all the events in the book took place in two days. There was too much action and too much travel from one spot to the next, too many rollercoaster ride events to make a two day time span believable. But, if you are into thrill books that are fast paced and don't care too much about substance or a well developed background story, you might like this. There were aspects that I did like, some I didn't like, but on the whole I cant give this a rave review. I might pick up the sequel to see if the story develops more or just to see how it ends, but I cant say I'll be running right out on the release date to get it. It's a fun book but not fabulous.in two days. There was too much action and too much travel from one spot to the next, too many rollercoaster ride events to make a two day time span believable.

B00004YC2F|5.0|Quite Simply: You will be on your feet applauding at the end of this preternaturally glorious performance of Rachmaninov's 3rd Piano Concerto.  It is absolute perfection on all accounts - Levine's, the Berliner Philharmoniker's, the sonic landscape provided by the engineering team...but above all, from Aracdi Volodos' keyboard wizardry.  This Rachmaninov album is more than fleshed out with astounding solo performances from Volodos; a particular highlight is his transcription of the Op. 19 Cello Sonata.    A Jewel in Volodos' Crown!
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|Once again we are entertained by the best of the best. The Duke, John Wayne, in one of the older movies. But still full of adventure, fun, laughter, action, and Americanism.

Prepair to stay on the edge of your seat. Another great John Wayne western. Enjoy.
B000XTCBWS|5.0|This Testament issue of Keilberth's 1955 Bayreuth Ring Cycle is a glamorous album, almost overwhelming to listen to.  The combination of singers of this caliber and the extraordinarily powerful stereo sound can leave you stunned!<br /><br />In honesty, though, the Krauss 1953 Cycle is a better performance!  Where Keilberth tends to be episodic, with momentum sagging in more than a few moments, once Krauss starts, his performance never stops spinning irresistibly forward, never loses it's tautness or onward momentum.  It's almost breathtaking to hear works of this size seem totally unbroken over their entire length.  (They didn't nickname it \\"the miracle Ring\\" for nothing!)<br /><br />Most of Keilberth's cast also sang for Krauss, but in most cases the earlier performances were fresher and, importantly, more spontaneous. Where there are cast differences, for example the Rheinmaidens, walkures, Loge, Fricka, and even Sieglinde, the advantage is with Krauss, sometimes by a large margin.<br /><br />Overall, Keilberth gives a good performance, whereas with Krauss, there's no sense of performance - the drama of the Ring seems to actually be happening in front of your mind's eye!<br /><br />However - - , the unbelievably gorgeous and powerful sound Decca gave to Keilberth can make an enormous difference in the overall experience, there's no question about it. So, if you want to luxuriate in an extraordinarily rich-sounding<br />performance, Keilberth is for you.  If you want to hear Wagner's vision made real, it's Krauss, despite the loss of impact in orchestral sound. (I've gone through the Laudis and Gala issues of the Krauss cycle, and have settled on the Archipel set, which has considerably more impact, presence and clarity in the vocal performances than I found in the Opera d'Oro set and isn't much different in orchestral perspective.)  Hard choice -- get both!!!! (If the Decca folks, who were there at the time, had recorded the Krauss cycle in this kind of sound, itreally would have been too good to be true!)<br /><br />MORE THAN A YEAR LATER, 9/09 - I enjoy this Ring cycle even more than I did originally, but I recently got the 1953 Bayreuth performance by Keilberth, and - - WOW!  I was so stunned after listening thru it the first time I had to put it aside and listen to some of the other top performances - this 1955 Keilberth, Furtwangler's '50 Scala, the Bohm (which I really don't like much), Barenboim's (which I think served conductor and director more than Wagner), and of course the superb Krauss.  I then returned to Keilberth's 1953 set, and found it just as stunning as it was the first time!  Despite all the efforts to \\"universalize\\" the Ring and make it about infinitely intellectual things, the truth is that it's really a saga of unbridled unrestrained emotion and the effects it has on existance, and that's what Keilberth focuses on in his 1953 reading.  It's an up-front in-your-face performance that will singe your eyebrows and take your breath away as you try to control the adrenaline!  No kidding!  It's not something I'd ever thought I would or could say, but his '53 Ring cycle is an exciting, even thrilling, and (unbelievably) FUN experience!  My guess is that it's probably what Wagner had wanted it to be, being a composer of theater works, and I'd also guess that as time passes it will become one of the very highly-regarded performances available to us. If you can get your hands on it, listen to the third act of Siegfried -- if you're still breathing calmly and are unmoved, ignore all of the above, but be sure you had your speakers turned on!!

Thank God for people like him amongst our country's best - the one's who keep our families safe at home.
B000O599WG|5.0|Once again we see The Duke taking command and working to make things right for a town full of people who have been done wrong. Full of action, fun, adventure, laughs, and a good dose of Americanism. John Wayne loved his Country. And he would fight to keep it the way it should be. Some of the best entertainment you can buy. And you can see it over and over as much as you want. The Duke has always made the American People feel proud of thier Country. And he does it once again. A top notch western.
B00000JGHL|3.0|Pacino has been my favorite actor ever since his amazing performance in Heat. It has always bothered me when people cut him down saying that he doesn't give a serious performance but  that he relies on overacting and shouting. After watching this film though I must agree. He gives an excellent performance that is very touching and subtle but  is ruined by a scene in the middle of the film where he resorts to shouting and overacting. Paul Schrader (Taxi Driver), Nicholas Pileggi (Goodfellas), and two other writers contributed to the script which focuses on government corruption in the Big Apple. John Pappas (Pacino) is the well liked mayor and Kevin (John Cusack) is his loyal assistant. Frank Anselmo (Danny Aiello) is a union boss who promotes himself as a friend of the people but is being told what to do by a powerful mobster. Bridget Fonda plays a tireless investigative reporter who knows that none of these men are what they seem and is determined to tell the citizens the truth. A rogue cop has a meeting with a drug dealer one rainy morning. He isn't wearing a vest and he doesn't have any backup to assist him should things go wrong. He has gotten a tip from the dealer's cousin as to where he can find his man and when all three of them come face to face they surprise each other and guns are drawn. In the chaotic shootout the cop and the dealer get shot as well as a six year old boy who was being walked to school by his grandfather. All three die. The story quickly breaks all over the news and the mayor has to address this tragedy. He makes a hastily assembled speech without knowing all the particulars and he assigns Kevin the task of finding out what really happened. This sends Kevin on a search for answers in which he finds out more than he ever wanted to  about Pappas. The mystery deepens when Kevin tries to figure out whose bullet struck the kid. Was it the cop's or the dealer's? The legal system is indicted as well since the dealer should have been in jail but ajudge let him walk. Martin Landau plays the conflicted judge and proves that nearly all the government officials in this film are corrupt. The scene that nearly spoils Pacino's overall performance is when he delivers the eulogy at the  boy's funeral. His advisers have all warned him that appearing at the funeral is not a wise move but he insists that he must be there to inspire hope and unity. The speech starts off sincere and builds from there. Soon Al is shouting and his eyes are going wild and he's slamming the pulpit with both fists. He works the mostly black congregation into a frenzy. We've seen this before and for the first time I realize that there is a time and a place in a Pacino film for this kind of outburst and at this particular moment   it doesn't feel right. Al does this better than anybody and even though it's entertaining to watch it comes at a price. Pacino is back to serious acting in the film's final scenes. By this time  Kevin  knows the truth and confronts Pappas  at his mansion before he is to speak at another memorial. Kevin is devastated that his mentor has been lying to him and Pacino plays the scene as if he were Kevin's father and Kevin is his grown son who no longer needs hims. The film has a lot of talented people involved and even though the story isn't that shocking and is confusing at times City Hall is a decent enough movie.

006112429X|5.0|Even after reading this novel twice I am unsure as to who is in the right or wrong: Kevin or Eva.     As someone who has no interest in having children, I felt a great deal of sympathy for Eva. How does one raise a child when that elusive mothering gene refuses to kick in? But perhaps the problem isn't Eva, who does show deep maternal love towards her daughter, but instead is Kevin. Are some children born unlovable?     The plot is important, of course, but to dwell too long on the particulars robs the reader of the delightful unfolding of complexity that elicts both intellectual and emotional responses. Let me instead comment on the writing.     This book is not for those who would rather read Nicholas Sparks or Danielle Steel. This book expects its readers to know language, revel in language. Lionel does not write \\"down\\" to the readers; on the contrary, she expects that a reader is versed in language and grammar and expects a book to be not only entertaining but well written. What a delight that is!     The best part of this mastery of language comes the recognition that perhaps it's not the author's own use of language but Eva's instead - a highly intelligent, literary, capable woman who refuses to be obsequious to slavish convention. Her voice propels the book and her voice is one of superiority marred by the realization that her life is overshadowed by her son, a son she was reluctant to create in the first place, yet now commands her life in all respects.     I cannot recommend this book more - I think it offers not only a great story, but a wonderful trip through the structure of language, to me its greatest selling point.

6305364648|5.0|I just want to say that this is one of my favorite films of all time. I say that because even after repeated watching it remains very fresh. I would like to add just one more thing that suddenly struck me when I watched it again last night and that is... the film makers were definitely inspired from the hit TV show of the 80's \\"Scarecrow and Mrs.King\\" with Kate Jackson. Films like \\"True Lies' are indeed rare treats. I can't wait for the great James Cameron's next film 'Avatar'.

I highly recommend this gorgeous and important film, enjoy!

B000HIVIOW|1.0|I ordered the version that this company \\"advertises\\" which has David Bowie doing an opening narrative. What I received does not have the David Bowie narrative as I ordered and paid for.  I know that there are two versions of this same story - one with David Bowie and one without.  I know what I ordered and what I received is not what I ordered.  I just read prior comments in which fellow purchasers experienced the same issue.  I am not very happy and not going through the headache of trying to return the item and start all over again somewhere else.  Just know that if you do buy this, you are purchasing the standard version, NOT the version that is advertised with David Bowie.  Other than this, the story is beautiful, one of my favorites.
B000O599WG|4.0|In Rio Bravo all the familiar stock characters are there- the taciturn two-fisted sheriff: his undependable sidekick: the young, inexperienced kid; the girl from the saloon; the old drunk or village fool for comic relief. Hawks takes these worn clichés and turns them around, works against them. The stock characters are portrayed realistically, in terms of how things probably were. John Chance, played by John Wayne acting against his usual image, is not the infallible lawman. In fact, though he always refuses help - for fear of getting men with families killed - he always needs it, and luckily for him it it's always there. Dude is more than undependable. He is a wreck of a man, self-destructive, humiliated, without any reason to live. Feather is not merely a pretty barroom singer; she is a strong, intelligent, independent woman who influences the hero far more than he does her. Stumpy is comic, but he is no relief. His foolishness is a carefully calculated mask to hide his fear and lack of belief in himself, qualities that he shares with the other characters. The plot is that of the hackneyed Western. The story is about five flawed people who desperately need each other without wanting to admit it, who teach each other self-reliance and self-respect, and who manage to redeem themselves with the considerable help of others. The action is moral as well as recognizably physical, and the subject is human dignity.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|It's not every director who can shoot an entire film with a hand-held video camera and make it engaging. But, for my money, that is precisely what director Matt Reeves has achieved with \\"Cloverfield.\\" I was admittedly quite torn about catching this in theaters last January. For every five people in my immediate circle who were praising this film to the high heavens, there were at least the same amount more who claimed it was just as bad as \\"The Blair Witch Project.\\" Much like that film, the camera does tend to shake. But, when you're running for your life while still trying to document everything you're witnessing, that pratfall is ultimately unavoidable. It did not, thankfully, detract me from investing my interest. And, unlike \\"Blair Witch,\\" I actually had a visual threat in the guise of a truly unique and terrifying creature to react to.    That same creature, incidentally, makes its abrupt and unexplained arrival on the very night five young New Yorkers decide to throw a going-away party for one of their own. The first fifteen minutes of the film eases you into these characters, giving you just the right amount of insight into who they are and what they're all about. But, once the head of Lady Liberty comes crashing down the street outside their building, the real thrills begin! This ferocious invader, standing nearly thirty stories high, is certainly a formidable threat in and of itself. But it soon becomes apparent to our protagonists that it is not, by any means, alone. The rampaging monster is host to a multitude of smaller parasitical organisms that drop off from its body and scuttle along the ground like scorpions. One bite from these vicious critters, without giving too much away, would make anybody pray for a bullet.     As a lifelong giant monster fan, I had a blast! Roland Emmerich, who ten years ago helmed the ill-received \\"Godzilla,\\" could easily learn a thing or two from \\"Cloverfield.\\" It was everything that film could and should have been. In termsof overall mood and atmosphere, I would probably rank this right alongside the Japanese classic, \\"Gojira.\\" I admit it may not be everybody's cup of tea, particulary for those who, like me, utterly despised \\"Blair Witch.\\" But there is still much to savor here.     Among that, predominantly, is the special effects team. Had I not, for whatever theoretical reason, realized this was a fictional movie I was watching, I would have sworn somebody had captured a genuine monster rampage on their video camera. And, amazingly, despite the fact this whole thing takes place in Manhattan, the vast majority of the film was actually lensed on Paramount's back-lot in Los Angeles! Talk about an illusion! This is why I so rabidly savor all those \\"behind-the-scenes\\" featurettes most others, my own spouse specifically, take for granted. The DVD may not retain the same lasting impact of the theatrical experience, as most of my peers have already outlined. But, for the uninitiated, it does offer some invaluable insight into what exactly made this the box-office hit it quickly became. This review ultimately represents my own opinion. However you potentially judge it is entirely up to you.

B00005NB8K|5.0|Although I have never agreed with drug use at all, I have always enjoyed the music of Jim Morrison and the Doors. (and many other groups of the 60's and 70's)...   I also love the acting ability of Val Kilmer, and he is awesome in this role. The movie is very well made, the music is fantastic, the storyline is wonderful, yet so sad...   I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who likes the Doors...
B000AP04L0|5.0|A must have! This DVD is great and arrived in great condition/new. If you've ever had a job you hated you can surely enjoy this comedy! As always, arrived in a timely manner thanks to Amazon!
0385338724|5.0|As usual we can rely on Sophie Kinsella to write a five star book.  And again she does not disappoint.  This is a wonderful read.  I don't think it helps to write about the storyline becuase every new page brings a laugh, groan or general feeling of wellbeing.  I always look forward to Ms Kinsella's work and I can't wait for her next book because Remeber Me? was a winner.

0451191153|4.0|This book has been reviewed to death.  I can't remember how I came across it, but I'm glad I did.  It is awkward reading, yet it sucks you through.  The characters seem to be be either black or white with a supporting cast of gray.  It is a worthwhile read.
B0010ZR160|3.0|I had heard a lot about this movie and I was excited to get it.  Most of the performances were very good and I thought Casey Affleck was good and believable in this role. Michelle Monaghan made a good team with him and was gorgeous as usual.  The other major cast members gave good performances.   The story is intriguing where you have to follow this guy go through the investigation and he gets some bum leads and some good ones.   The thing I didn't like about the movie was the didactic that the state knows better what to do for kids as opposed to their parents.    Why did Ben Affleck need to shove this bleeding heart liberal message down our throats at the end?  It ruined the movie for me.  Almost a really good movie.
B000HCO83Q|3.0|If they make another after this It better pick up all the slack in this one, this was bad, not horrible, but bad.
1400063515|3.0|For all the interesting stories, Black Swans has essentially the same message as Taleb's earlier book \\"Fooled By Randomness\\"; market prices do not follow a bell curve, and instead have a lot more unexpected extreme events. That said, most investment-related books tend not to linger on this issue, so Taleb is providing a reminder of something critical in markets. His style does come across arrogant, and judging by the bibliography (as well as the main text), he does want to show the world he is widely read. The stories are fun, but at times they are tangential to his thesis. The problem with reading his book is that it leaves one thinking that all investment returns come from chance. I find Mandelbrot's ideas of \\"gray swans\\" more appealing in that respect as it hints at the possibility of some skill. Taleb says he is a fan of Mandelbrot, so it would have been nice for him to explore this idea more. The book may not be the most inspiring for those involved in markets (we're all rolling dice), but a much needed reminder of the role of chance.
0805066691|5.0|There's a saying - \\"history is written by the winners\\" and you never realise how true it really is till you read books like this one, which tells the story of the \\"losers\\" in history from their own point of view. From the moment of discovery of \\"the new world\\" it has been a story of decimation of the native tribes and this is the first account of the American West I've read that consistently gives the Indian point of view.  You realise reading this that they didn't really stand much of chance against an onslaught of greed and dishonesty that engulfed their lands.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this story is not unique and has been repeated, with variations, in many places in the world (eg Peru, Mexico , Australia & Canada) what is somewhat surprising is that as much as survived as it has of what the Indians thought of the constantly broken treaties and massacres of their people given their almost universal illiteracy.  (Much thinner histories survive from other countries where similar events happened)<br /><br />Any study of the spread of white culture in the 19th century in America should include books like this - they are a needed dose of reality and give depth to a story that otherwise is extremely one sided and provide a history that needs to be remembered in its own right.
B00104QSOM|2.0|We acquired this movie because it had won several awards and the main character is played by one of our favorite stars, Daniel Day-Lewis, but as the movie unfolds, we found ourselves disappointed by the film. While the performances are excellent and the story a clear indication of where ambition, corruption and big business, specially the oil industry can take individual passions, the lack of humanity of some of these individuals is simply abhorrent.    The film delves into the beginnings of the oil industry in the United States, seen through the life of a self made oilman by the name of Daniel Plainview, masterfully played by Daniel Day-Lewis. He travels the country identifying opportunities where to buy land that yields black gold, oil, to gain power, wealth and status.    It is during the early part of the 20th century and we get the impression that the process was brutal, without regard to the cost of human life and at times with dire consequences for the families that lived on the land where oil was found.    The movie confronts religion and family values against capitalism and the acquisition of power, and it is terrible to see how a young man who claims to be a prophet forces Daniel Plainview to accept religion in exchange for land where to build a pipe line, later paying back by having to renounce his beliefs in exchange for money to cover debts resulting from the market crash that leaves him penniless.    Not a movie I will see again... anytime soon.
B000K1P66W|5.0|This same book was loaned to my husband about a year ago.  He was having an issue with another close family member and was almost consumed with guilt over the actions of that family member (actions which he has no control over). He doesn't read much but between the person who loaned the book and myself, we convinced him to read it.  It took awhile for him to finish because he was really interested in it and wanted to understand each of the 4 agreements thouroughly.  It isn't a particullarly hard read but after each chapter or two, you need to stop and reflect how it relates to your life and how you can incorporate the ideas into your future thinking.      My husband had me order this book so he could have it as his own personal copy and also I ordered another copy for him to give to his sibling.
0452289963|5.0|Excellent life-changing book.  Might be too deep for some readers, but if you want to be enlightened and really be more at peace, read it and use the online resources at Oprah.com as well.
B0000047CX|5.0|In history, seemingly all great things are happenstance. One could certainly say the same about this serendipitous recording. A quiet, gentle, beautiful record of 8 songs (and 2 reprises) it created a time capsule of that era that surprisingly stands up to todays standards. A great album to relax to, put it on when you need to seriously unwind without drugs or alcohol. It works amazingly well.
B0017QDH3S|4.0|A decent Sci-Fi.<br />It is worth an evening of your time.Suspenseful.I'll give the acting a C+<br />I just wish Hollywood would quit misusing the Lord's Name.<br />There is no need for it,doing so diminishes the quality of a movie.<br />There is one scene of a blatant violent killing ,which I found to be totally unnecessary.<br />I wouldn't recommend it for a family viewing because of this.Very little swearing though.<br />I was disappointed with the ending.<br />Rather an abrupt ending that left no closure with several questions unanswered.<br />Special effects was slightly above average.<br />A good watch but definitely not a favorite Sci-Fi of mine.
B0000VCZK2|4.0|Great set.  Couldn't bring myself to buy it for 90$ when it came out.  But well worth the current price.  The addition of the director's cuts and what not are great, the extra story line pieces that had been cutout really help to further the character development.  Only downside is the crappy aspect ratio on all movies but ALIENS (which is the correct 16:9, 1.78:1ish, ratio), 2.53... Who has a 2.53:1 TV???  NOT ME!!!  Buy it anyway, great set.  But complain about the aspect, maybe we can get movies that actually fit our high res 3K$+ TVs...
032147404X|4.0|and a reasonable read.  he even has a sense of humor.  He gives you a scenario and then tells you about how to do or correct it.
B000H0MKOC|3.0|This one's worth a rental just for the scenes involving Congress and the lobbyists interactions with his son.  There are a few funny moments, but it seems like they could trim it down to an hour and stick it on HBO. Hard to rate higher than 3 stars due to several points of utter boredom when nothing is happening at all.  Some interesting arguments are touched on about the hypocrisy of  the governments stance on tobacco and the lobbyists response.  There's also a sprinkling of dark humor, but there's too much wasted time in my opinion.  3.5 stars on a good day

B000I5YCCO|5.0|I think Taylor Swift is one of those likeable artists who will stay around for a while til shes in her 30's or 40's.  I like her much better than the overhyped Carrie Underwood.  While her voice may not be as impressive as Underwood, she does have good songwriting ability.  I first heard of her when I heard \\"Tim McGraw\\" on froggy here in Pittsburgh.  It was so good and original!  I was waiting to hear more from this new talented country artist.  Then I heard the 2007 single \\"Teardrops On My Guitar.\\"  It was a nice surprsie!  I decided to take a listen for the rest of this album.  The rest wasn't bad either.  If you like the radio singles then there's more to offer besides that.  My favorite song is \\"Picture To Burn.\\"  I wish she would have won Best New Artist for the Grammy's instead of the overrated Amy Winehouse and I'm sure I'm not the only one!  I highly reccomend this to country and non-country fans alike!
0783230079|4.0|I missed this when it came out.[[ASIN:B00000IQW5 Always]] is another one about a ghost with unfinished business that got to me.<br />Holly Hunter ( from Always) and Kyra Sedgwick ( from [[ASIN:630471193X Phenomenon]]) are two of my favorite actresses.<br />The late 80's and early 90's was a very spiritual period.<br />This movie is one to see with your family!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Very good workout.  The instructor (Jillian Michaels) doesn't go too fast which a lot of the exercise instructors seem to do.  She explains the movement by describing how to do it, what muscles to concentrate on, and which muscles this works.  She goes slow enough to work the muscle instead of just doing the motions.  Produces a good sweat!!
B00154GEFU|4.0|I love it when bands get together and put out albums.  Asia has been a very long time coming and it was worth the wait.  This is everything I hoped for and expected.
B0000X61UU|5.0|I used this item in VHS format and needed the DVD now, since pretty much no one has tape players anymore. It was much easier and the video is a great total body workout, especially for anyone wanting to tone and tighten without bulking up.
B0014127BO|4.0|First off, why isn't Bryan Adams still a staple on the radio or pop charts? This import CD has everything we all know and love from Adams.  Jim Vallance even pops in with some song writing help and makes this a real piece of art.  Bryan doesn't really rock out anymore but this CD is full of great pop rock songs and I enjoyed all of it very much.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This dvd is amazing.  I am a mother of 5 and have been working out for about 5 years now.  I was starting to turn into the cardio queen, getting bored with my routine, in a rut and not pushing myself.  My body stopped changing and I was just maintaining.  That was not good seeing as I am still 15 lbs overweight and need more toning.  After watching biggest loser I have become a fan of Jillian.  I decided to order her tape in order to lose the last 15 lbs and tone up.  I am on day 10 of doing this tape and I can already see a change in my body.  I was amazed.  I started with level 1 and moved to level 2 after about 8 days.  Level 2 is really hard for me and I am sure that I will be on level 2 for at least 3 weeks until I master it.  I can't wait to see the changes in my body after 1 month.  I doubt that I will lose 20 lbs but will be happy if I lose 10 plus more toning.
B0012QE4OY|3.0|Yes, this movie is cheesy and totally lacks a plot line, but the dancing is amazing.  I was especially blown away by Moose.  I never expected that nerdy character to bust out \\"Michael Jackson-style\\" on the stairs.  Dancing in the rain is also totally unbelievable, but it doesn't make the choreography and soundtrack any less entertaining!
B000E41MS6|5.0|My husband loves it!! He is a Dr. Who fan and missed a few episodes from Series 1, this was a great way for him to catch up and re watch old and missed episodes
B0000640VO|4.0|The first word that comes to mind after watching this film is \\"cute\\".  The main character is a joy to watch and the other quirky characters make it interesting.  I highly recommend this movie if you're looking for something fun and romantic.
0452289963|3.0|This book was certainly inspirational, and had many good guidelines for living a stress-free, happy life by focusing your mind away from daily monotony and worry.  I did feel, however, that there was so much hype by Oprah and online surrounding the content of this book, that I was a little disappointed by it.  The begining and ending chapters are the best, while the middle is full of material that just repeats what was already covered in the previous chapters and also goes out on a limb a little too far.  Some of Mr. Tolle's points are far-fetched, but overall he has good advice for those looking for peaceful living and spiritual growth.
B000077VR3|5.0|I am always looking for a good dance movie and they are few and far between, but this movie definitely fit the bill.  This fast-paced movie has great musical scenes, and the acting between the musical numbers is also great--not cheesy.  My favorite scene is \\"Roxane\\".  It cuts to several different scenes and features great dancers and singers.  I was very pleasantly surprised by Ewan McGregor.  You have to see this movie!
0385338082|4.0|This book is an interesting, and very quick read.  It's completely predictable, and some of the situations that Emma gets herself into are a bit over the top, but all and all it's a good read, and it will make you laugh.  Not as good as Shopoholic though I must say!
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|I've been an R.E.M.fan since I used to see them at the 40 Watt Club in Athens....back in the day.  IMHO this is their best effort since Monster!   It's sooo good to have the boys back!
B0011HOEY4|5.0|This film, American Gangster, was a real treat.    I especially enjoyed the unrated extended version of this film.A far more satisfying finish, I feel.
B00005QXDD|5.0|Yeah, it is side-splittingly funny.  But it also rocks like crazy and the songs are well-crafted and tuneful.      Some people have said the spoken-word tracks get old after repeated listenings.  Fine, take off all the spoken bits and you still have a solid album's worth of songs.  I think the comedy bits only total about 10-12 minutes.    Songs like \\"Wonderboy\\" and \\"Tribute\\" are literally as good as it gets in rock music.  They are classics and hold up well against just about anybody.     Some people complain that numerous songs are very short, clocking in at about one minute or so.  Well, I guess those same people have a problem with quite a few Beatles songs - especially on albums like the White Album.  Those same people would have to totally denigrate most of the long medley on \\"Abbey Road\\".  There is nothing wrong with a short song, as long as it is a good short song.    And yes, I do realize I was talking about the Beatles and Tenacious D in the same breath. They deserve it.  The D are rock gods and this album is gift to we mere mortals.
B00000IOSU|5.0|I could never consider ANYONE who gave this CD less than four stars and a music lover. My musical taste is rather eclectic and includes everything from opera, new age and Celtic to acid rock (except for rap, some cry-in-your-beer country and hip-hop). This CD is a gem to be prized in any collection. Sarah McLachlan has a fantastic voice and the music to accentuate her talents.
B000QUEQBI|5.0|One of the best action movie of the last five years. Danny Glover in bad guy really worth.
1594200106|1.0|I could not believe the legion of rave reviews for this book.  It was trite and melodramatic.  The translation was bad . . .I'd expect more from the daughter of Robert Graves: i.e., just how common was the use of the word \\"ecosystem\\" in the early 1950's?;  I assume that the main character was \\"nauseated\\" and not \\"nauseous\\" ....although the whole book was \\"nauseous\\" to me; and a spider is not an insect.<br /><br />I staggered to the 400- plus page finish line. . . . at the end, all I could think of was that there are so many books out there to read, so little time, and I wasted valuable reading time on this.  I know I'm going against the grain here . . . perhaps I'm just missing something.
B000WCDI64|5.0|Just finished watching this dvd and was blown away.... she is more amazing in concert than in her studio performances. This is the mark of a true talent... and to those who said she was \\"loaded\\", I disagree.. she was sometimes too moved by the lyrics of the songs she had written at a very painful point in her life, that it was easier for her to not explain.... AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0689865384|3.0|This is the first book in the Uglies Trilogy by Scott Westerfield. The book follows Tilly and Shay, two Uglies who are waiting to turn 16 so that they can get their operations and become Pretties. Pretties are all beautiful and get to live in New Pretty City where life is a party and beautiful all of the time. Everyone becomes a Pretty when they turn 16 without exception. While Tilly yearns to become a Pretty Shay wants to escape Uglyville to see what lies outside of the city. Shay is worried about the Pretty operation; what if more than just your appearance changes?<br /><br />Does the above sound like a shallow premise for a story? Well it is kind of. Although it makes you think a little bit (and I mean a little bit) about what would happen if everyone was perfect and beautiful. Although the story really isn't about that and maybe if it talked more about that it might have some substance.<br /><br />I realize being 30 I am not the main market for this young adult novel; but it seemed like surfacey and overused material for me. I think even young girls reading it will figure out what is going by the first chapter of the book. In tone it reminded me a little (tiny) bit of the Tripods Trilogy by John Christopher; except with young girls, and it was all about being pretty and identical, and humans actually have it pretty darn good, and there was a little love story, and I guess it's been about 15 years since I read the Tripods so maybe it wasn't all that similar. I really think it had a similar tone to it though.<br /><br />By the end of the book I am still not sure if people being turned Pretty is all that horrible. I think you were supposed to think it is the worst thing in the world but I wasn't all that convinced.<br /><br />All the above being said. The book was simply written, easy to read, a very quick read, and entertaining enough that I finished it. Given all I have heard about these novels I already purchased the next two so...I will probably read the next book in the series even though I am not all that enamored with it. It gets 3 stars for an \\"It's okay, I guess\\". It didn't offend me but it didn't work my mind or thrill me either.<br />karissabooks.blogspot.comam not all that enamored with it.

B00005JA2B|5.0|Kansas bred progressive rockers simply called Kansas' fourth album Leftoverture was released in October of 1976.<br />By 1976, Kansas had three albums under their belt. Their 1974 debut which went nowhere (but had memorable songs like Can I Tell You and Lonely Wind), their early 1975 effort Song For America (with the title cut and Down the Road) showed promise and growth but their third album released later in 1975 Masque (with Icarus and The Pinnacle) sold less and Kansas were faced with being dropped from Kirshner Records (a label distributed by CBS Records (now Sony BMG) which was owned by rock impressario Don Kirshner who helped shape the career of The Monkees and launched the TV series Don Kirshner's Rock Concert).<br />As a result, singer/keyboard player Steve Walsh, guitarist/keyboard player Kerry Livgren, guitarist Rich Williams, bass player Dave Hope, violinist/vocalist Robbie Steinhardt and drummer Phil Ehart went to Studio in the Country in Louisiana (the studio was so named as it was in the middle of a swamp) to record their fourth album with producer Jeff Glixman. At the time, Walsh suffered writers block so it was up to Livgren to write the material and boy did he deliver.<br />We open the album with Kansas' first US Top 20 hit, the rocker \\"Carry On Wayward Son\\". The song was composed at the last minute after the rest of the album was written. This was the song that put Kansas on the map and I can see why as it is a guitar and keyboard driven rocker. This song is being played right now on some radio station (in its 1984 remix form but this is the original mix on Leftoverture). Next is the philosophical piece and a great song called \\"The Wall\\" which was Livgren's piece about man's place on Earth and where does God play a role. Ironically, Livgren plus Hope would become Born-Again Christians in 1979. Next is another great rocker called \\"What's On My Mind\\" which is just an awesome song and why Livgren was not ever picked to be one of rock's greatest axe slingers aside WIlliams remains a mystery. The album's first side ended with the epic \\"Miracles Out Of Nowhere\\". This epic has Walsh and Steinhardt on lead vocals and reminds me of Yes, ELP, Genesis and Pink Floyd musically with its changes in dynamics, tempo changes and so forth, especially the end where it goes fast then ends with violin, organ, tympani and the inevitable gong.<br />The album's second half starts with \\"Opus Insert\\" which is another great piece. It goes from fast to slow then to a carousel organ-type middle section with synthesizers before going back to the music for verse and chorus then has a reprise of the intro and the bridge to end this song. Next is another great piece called \\"Questions Of My Childhood\\" which is driven by synthesizers and acoustic guitars and is a great song. Next is my second favorite on the album called \\"Cheyenne Anthem\\" which speaks about the fall of the American Indian tribes and the struggles to adapt to change. The music is amazing, acoustic and slow for the verses then goes to a fast middle section with synthesizers, organs, drums and violins. Then back to acoustic intro before ending with full band. Awesome song! We close the album with the fittingly titled \\"Magnum Opus\\" which is an eight and a half minute epic. The first 2:30 is nice and relaxing, especially the Howling at the Moon part but then we go all throttle fast for a few minutes before slowing down then speed up again before ending in a majestic way. Shame musicians can't play like this anymore.<br />Leftoverture was the album that made Kansas a household name and reached #5 on the Billboard album chart and sold four million copies in the US alone and made them the top American progressive rock band out there.<br />The album was re-released as a remastered CD for its 25th Anniversary in May of 2001 and sounds amazing. Also, it has extra songs which were a spirited live version of Carry On Wayward Son which buries the Two For The Show version by a longshot. Next is an awesome version of the epic Cheyenne Anthem from December, 1977 and rivals its studio counterpart.<br />Leftoverture still sounds competent and fresh today and has aged better than any disco trash record.<br />RECOMMENDED!rsion of the epic Cheyenne Anthem from December, 1977 and rivals its studio counterpart.   Leftoverture still sounds competent and fresh today and has aged better than any disco trash record.   RECOMMENDED!
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|Cloverfield did not live up to its hype in my opinion.  Maybe it's because I watched the dvd rather than see it the theater, but I just kept feeling that it was a leadin for another movie.  Of course, watching the \\"extras\\" I got it that they had a very limited budget, and I have to give the production props for very good cgi work.  I just expected more.
B000002UHG|5.0|Pink Floyd keyboard player Rick Wright released his second proper (and as of September, 2008, his final) solo album Broken China in October of 1996 in Europe and here in the US in March of 1997.<br />Broken China was Rick's first solo album under his own name since his 1978 classic but wrongly overlooked Wet Dream (we're not counting 1984's disastrous collaboration with ex-Fashion member Dave Harris as the duo Zee which released the album Identity).<br />On Broken China, Rick collaborated with Anthony Moore, whom had worked on Pink Floyd's 1994 album The Division Bell writing the lyrics for \\"Wearing The Inside Out\\" and Anthony wrote some lyrics on 1987's A Momentary Lapse of Reason. Like Floyd bandmate singer/guitarist David Gilmour, lyrics weren't Wright's strong suit but came up with pieces of music like no tomorrow.<br />Broken China's concept is based on actual events Rick had experienced with his then-girlfriend and now late ex-wife Millie whom battled clinical depression which she triumphed over.<br />Wright employed a team of superb musicians to assist him on Broken China including guitarists Tim Renwick and Dominic Miller (Sting), drummer Manu Katche (Peter Gabriel and Robbie Robertson) and bass player Pino Palladino (The Who, David Gilmour among others). We also hear cello from Sian Bell, oboe by Kate St John (ex of Dream Academy) and guest vocals by Sinead O'Connor.<br />Broken China opens with the beautiful instrumental \\"Breaking Water\\" which is musically the son of Cluster One from The Division Bell. It segues into the track \\"Night Of A Thousand Furry Toys\\" which is a very catchy song about those precious influential early years of one's development as an impressionable child. The subject of child abuse is discussed in \\"Hidden Fear\\" in which Wright showcases some hidden vocal talents that wasn't heard in the Floyd catalog since Obscured by Clouds' \\"Stay\\" and soon we're back into instrumental territory with the sinister \\"Runaway\\" which ends the \\"catalyst leading to condition\\" portion of the album.<br />The next two tracks \\"Unfair Ground\\" and \\"Satellite\\" are great instrumentals with Renwick playing great tasty guitar solos on the latter. The album's standout track \\"Woman Of Custom\\" is next and Dominic's acoustic guitar is accented by a strong vocal delivery by Rick. The second section closes with \\"Interlude\\" in which the album reaches new dark conceptual lows sealing depression.<br />The short \\"Black Cloud\\" is a intro to the album's greatest track \\"Far From The Harbour Wall\\" which is the closest representation of what clinical depression is on album and also Rick's reaction to it. \\"Drowning\\" is a downward spiral yet powerful instrumental into total darkness. \\"Reaching For The Rail\\" features Irish songstress Sinead O'Connor delivering a vocal performance that must have hit pretty close to home for her, given her abusive childhood experiences. Though I didn't like Sinead's music, she does a great job on this track as does Renwick whose guitar solo here is SUPERB.<br />The album's last four songs finds happiness starting with \\"Blue Room in Venice\\" which is a great piece. Next is the gorgeous \\"Sweet July\\" which is a great showcase of Rick's tasteful piano, coupled with Miller's guitar. The rocker \\"Along The Shoreline\\" is next and sounds like the son of \\"Run Like Hell\\" but is positive though, and serves as an epiphany of love and respect with Renwick adding another Gilmour-esque solo and a superb Wright keyboard solo. Sinead O' Connor gets the album's last word on \\"Breakthrough\\" which gives the album a happy ending. Her voice is perfectly well suited here too in what's naturally a song to be sung from the female perspective. Works out perfectly! Rick performed this track with David Gilmour on the latter's 2002 Royal Festival Hall concerts which was documented on the David Gilmour in Concert DVD in 2002.<br />While Broken China is a great solo record and in my Top 10 of best solo Floyd efforts of all time, the album was criminally overlooked as Hanson and The Spice Girls heisted the music scene in both the US and UK. Sales notwithstanding, this record is superb.<br />RECOMMENDED!on and The Spice Girls heisted the music scene in both the US and UK. Sales notwithstanding, this record is superb.   RECOMMENDED!
B00005JPTK|4.0|Will Smith was very good in this movie and I enjoyed this interpretation of the novel.  Nothing is ever as good as the book, however.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|The film version of Pink Floyd's The Wall was released in August of 1982.<br />The movie did fairly well at the box office. It initially grossed $23 million which was alot of money back in 1982 considering it was competing against films like E.T., Rocky III and the first Poltergeist. I first saw the movie when my father rented this movie for me when I was 9 (I am not joking folks, this was in September, 1985 as I had been a fan for quite some time by then).<br />It is still a great film even today though some say too overdramatic. The screenplay was written by Floyd bass player/singer/lyricist Roger Waters amd the film was directed by Alan Parker (famed for the movies Midnight Express, The Committments and Evita) and starred Boomtown Rats frontman (and future Live Aid and Live 8 organizer) Bob Geldof in the leading role as Pink.<br />Originally, the film was to be footage of the band performing The Wall concerts at London's Earls Court but was scrapped at Parker's request (though this footage is available via bootleg in not bad quality).<br />The movie tells the story of Pink, a rock star whom had a traumatic life. His father died in WWII, had to contend with an overbearing mother, cruel sarcastic teachers, an unhappy marriage and a successful music career. One night after calling his wife and hearing she cheats on him, he invites a groupie into his hotel and loses it.<br />The character was based on part-Waters, part-Keith Moon, part-Syd Barrett and part fascism.<br />The film is noted for having the unreleased tracks When The Tigers Broke Free (parts 1 and 2), a new version of Mother, the studio version of What Shall We Do Now. Plus new versions of Another Brick in the Wall (part 3), Is There Anybody Out There?, Bring the Boys Back Home and Outside the Wall. Also, Bob Geldof does the vocals on both parts to In The Flesh (one with a brass band). The rest of the tracks were re-mixed and/or edited.<br />Gerald Scarfe's animations in this film are the same as the ones shown at the original Wall concerts Pink Floyd performed in 1980 and 1981.<br />This DVD (which was re-released with new artwork to coincide with The Wall album's 25th anniversary with a new slipcase cover and artwork) has bonuses of The Other Side of The Wall documentary as aired on MTV in 1982, the Another Brick 1980 video filmed to promote the album and aired on Don Kirshner's Rock Concert and Midnight Special, the theatrical trailer and various other surprises.<br />Highly recommended!l Wall concerts Pink Floyd performed in 1980 and 1981.   This DVD (which was re-released with new artwork to coincide with The Wall album's 25th anniversary with a new slipcase cover and artwork) has bonuses of The Other Side of The Wall documentary as aired on MTV in 1982, the Another Brick 1980 video filmed to promote the album and aired on Don Kirshner's Rock Concert and Midnight Special, the theatrical trailer and various other surprises.

B0010YSD7M|4.0|The Ark of Truth is well done as a conclusion to Star Gate SG 1. It wraps up the last major plotline very well. I especially liked the way that it starts in the past so you see the begining and then jumps to the present to start working on wrapping up the series.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|This album is my very first time completely listened to Cash ! I was shocked & moved by 'First time ever I saw your face ' , never expect one can express this song like that . Then , Give my love to Rose , In my life , Hurt , Personal Jesus , changed my point of view too .     Since I have this cd , I played it hundred times & I get addicted to it . I started to collect his other works . Now I got more than 20 of his cds.    I'm still addicted & guessed it last in my lifetime !
B0002IU988|4.0|I am not a passonate music fan. I don't listen to just one thing.  Somedays I will play Mozart in the car and other days I will rock out to Country. I was a very unlikely fan of Creed.  I reluctantly went to a CREED show with some friends and was moved by the adoration of their fans.  I then bought the CD and loved it.  Then they broke up.  Nothing since Creed gave me the chills until AlterBridge.  At first I wasn't that crazy about the singer on the cd because I was expecting the low baratone sound of Creed, until I saw them live.  WOW!  I have a real appreciation for the band.  I especially love the bass lines.  The cd is great but a live show is AWESOME!
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Horrendous.  First off, it uses the old \\"shaky cam\\" nonsense, which went out of style many years ago.  Please, folks -  only Blair Witch made that work. I don't like gore, and I don't like heavy violence, and there was none of that in this movie - it was PG-13 for a reason - but you see nothing, and you understand nothing.  The lousy shaky cam nonsense is bad enough to make you close your eyes in parts, the acting is awful and the plot non-existent.  If you are over 15, forget it, what a complete waste.  This is one of maybe 4 movies in my entire life I turned off out of simple boredom after about 40 minutes.  Just awful.
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|This is a fabulous movie!  I don't care how historically inaccurate it is; I didn't watch it to learn history!  I watched it to be entertained, and it did just that.  It was as good as the first Elizabeth movie, and it makes me want to look for the next installment of Elizabeth.  Because of these movies, I thinks she's my favorite queen.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|Bloody good show, I say, bloody good.  Tim Burton's vision and direction, spot on.  Sondheim's score and actors who can carry a tune in a cup, if not a bucket, brilliant.  I loved Helena Bonham-Carter, the lovelorn Mrs. Lovett.  She's just as deranged, if not more, than the rest of this motley crew and I wouldn't even begin to compare this performance to the legendary Ms. Landsbury.  She starts out meek and ends on a high note folks, or is that a shriek?  In any case, cheers to taking on the challenge.  Messers Depp, Rickman and Cohen surprised me.  Depp's at a disadvantage--he's not English, but with his recent and prolonged stints as Cap'n Jack, Sir James Barrie, John Wilmot - The Earl of Rochester, to mention only a few, he's reached a fairly happy medium in his delivery, both in dialogue and song.  Warning:  the violence is graphic and disturbing, but oh what a film.  You'll shudder with antici........................pation.

0861714911|5.0|I had been attracted to the pali canon for some time, but where do you start? This book will give you a very good impression of what 'the word of the buddha' is. It contains translations of a broad selection of the original texts, while the introduction and commentary are truly helpful for putting it all in perspective. For me, this anthology proved to be the entrance gate to a wealth of texts that I would probably not have started to read without this wonderful book.
0739366408|4.0|I gave this five stars for the story... however, the book is really five and the audio book is 4 stars being as it is abridged. I am not a fan of abridged audio books but couldn't find this priced right unabridged. Either way this and Day by Day Armageddon (A Zombie Novel) are two must reads if you are into zombies and what might happen if things go really wrong! The interview format the voices used all lend to an authentic story of a look back on a horrific event and those who survived. As you listen you can actually imagine this happening, and that to me is the most entertaining and spooky thing about World War Z!
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I bought this and returned it two days later.  Battery wouldn't hold a charge for more than 5-10 minutes (package says will run for 45 minutes).  I wanted it for mostly picking up pet hair - what it did bother to pick up ended up all over the unit instead of in the collection cup.  Took it back and got a refund...
B00127RAJY|5.0|Phew! You want a hard workout in a short amount of time, then this dvd is for you. I am quite fit but it is still challenging and exhausts you, yet you feel amazing once you've completed a level. It has 3 levels with 1 being the 'easiest' but still works up a sweat. The workouts are well planned out and you utilize more muscles in the one exercise which is tiring.No resting so you complete it within 22 mins,including cool down.  It is great for shifting those last stubborn pounds and you learn how much your body can take and how hard you have to push through that plateau to reach your desired weight. Highly recommended, as with all the Jillian Michael products...results gauranteed....if you follow it strictly! Good Luck, you can do it.

B000000OUJ|5.0|Everything about this album is amazing -- classic Wu banger. From the cult classic film samples Shogun Assasin to RZA's awe-inspiring production to GZA's elder of wisdom like lyrics and flow.     Everything about this album is on point. I still listen to this album casually to this day. For those who have never heard \\"Liquid Swords\\" or and are fixated on the modern 'money and cars' commercial hip-hop paradigm garbage and want to know the true essence of hip-hop is buy this. Other Wu albums rival close but this is the cream of the crop. Every track is dramatic -- true art in every form. Lyrically GZA is the best MC in the group, while RZA is the most talented overall in my opinion. GZA raps about topics that cross life on the streets, crime, chess, 5 percenter teachings with a methodical laid back flow. The combination gives my ears orgasms. Also I get 200th review!
0765316889|5.0|I read this entire book in 36 hours! I thouroughly enjoyed Mistborn#1. This book is an even better read. I highly recommend this book with all due haste. This book was as solid as a single story book as any I have read. He has mastered telling a story Plot in one book, even though the series may be headed for multiple books. The plots in the past two books have started with a goal/problem, and by the end of the book they get resolved/fixed etc.<br /><br />I think it is a shame that emerging authors have a weak way of connecting with the mass market. I will honestly say that I would have maybe never read any of his books, if it were not for Harriet \\"tapping\\" him as the author to finish the Wheel of Time's final book. I wanted to read Brandon's book to get a \\"measuring stick\\" of his writing style. He is unequivocally capable of holding his own with the \\"big boys\\" of Epic Fantasy. Look out Martin, Goodkind, Weis&Hickman, you have a young buc on the scene that will BE a force in this genre.<br /><br />On his webpage is an Ebook that is in beta... Yea tech-term-style beta. You can read the story now even though it has not been officially published. I think it is on edit 4 or 5 OF 12 with TOR.<br /><br />Sanderson you have a life time reader.
B000E1155E|5.0|Amazing album, they are a great band...honestly, just buy this, you won't be disappointed, and this is not some fangirl from the UK...(its a fangirl from the US)...but nevertheless, I think everyone will enjoy this music.
0810994739|5.0|I read the first Wimpy Kid novel to my three sons and when we saw this novel at the store there was no question if we'd pick it up or not. We couldn't wait to be transported back into Gregory's life. We laughed and laughed. Rodrick Rules was the best entertainment we've had reading. It's simple pictures bring Gregory's family and friends to life, the way he sees them and we were once again filled with glee. Can't wait for number 3!
B001886LQU|5.0|So I got my Steelbook Edition. Sure its nothing to be jumping off the walls for. But hey, its a nice metal case, has the movie and what not in it. I guess only negative is that you can get a deluxe ver. @ Target and get Rob's Goin to Japan Party Mix. Or Im sure Walmart had some extra. Every big store had their plus to it. I guess bottom line. If you bought the original version, stick with it. If you want to spend $30-50 more for the Steelbook, (some cases $50-99 now online) then go for it. If youre a fan and collector of monster movies, then get it. Otherwise, stick with the boring ver. Movie suggestion, get some drinks, pop the movie in, and start hitting the drinks when the party gets going.
0452289963|1.0|While I can agree with him that an awakening is about to occur, I think, believe and expect that Eckhart Tolle is wrong about the nature of this awakening. His is a false awakening because in writing about his awakening too often he repeats the lie that myth is truth. The true awakening will occur when the many of our global culture reject the lie that myth is truth in all of it's various forms and accept the truth that myth is myth. The true awakening will occur when we acknowledge that the mystery of existence makes possible an infinite number, diversity, and variety of myths only limited by our creative abilities and powers of imagination. The true awakening will occur when we choose to believe in the truth of the one myth out of all made possible by the mystery of existence that enable us to have the highest esteem of self and world that we can possibly imagine because doing so creates emotional balance within our minds and our lives that is conducive to happiness and health; not because of the lie that myth is truth.

B00104QSOM|3.0|Hands-down, this movie gets five stars. Go out and see it now. Buy it. Maybe the 1-disc edition, though. As a special edition, this dvd is lacking compared to P.T. Anderson's other, more thorough dvds. The whole thing is housed in a cardboard slipcase and folder which leads me to believe they didn't want to use plastics in the manufacturing of it. That's fine with me; it's kind of nice to see a slim, simple dvd package these days. But the special features on disc two are just as slim. It takes about twenty minutes to sit through all of them. There's a slideshow of pictures that influenced the look of the movie-actually pretty interesting, though it lacks context. And some deleted scenes, which were probably deleted for a reason. Lastly, there's a black and white film on the history of oil. Nothing really special.  I can't stress how awesome this movie is, but I'd recommend buying the 1-disc edition because of the price.
B00000I2PG|5.0|I'vd had this album for years in vinyl and I just bought it in CD format to play it in my car. It's an album you'll never get tired of listening to. The throbbing beat, the lavish orchestration, and the corny lyrics are a winning combinaion.
B00003CX8V|5.0|When watching `The Apartment' I expected something completely different.  I expected something outlandish and slapstick and more in the vein of `The Odd Couple' and I think that because I really had no idea what this movie was about.  I didn't bother reading the back of the DVD case because I knew I wanted to see it based on its reputation alone.  Why spoil the surprise, and so I brought it home and popped it in and here I am now, writing my review of one of the best comedies I've ever seen.<br /><br />The reason `The Apartment' is so great is because it is extremely smart.  It's funny, sure, but in an honest and believable manner.  It's witty and original and the chemistry between the stars Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine is effortless.<br /><br />The story is not a simple one to explain without giving too much away, and I hate giving too much away so I will attempt this the best I can.  Jack Lemmon plays C.C. Baxter, a junior accountant for a New York City firm, who found an interesting way of climbing the corporate ladder.  Baxter (of `Buddy Boy' as he is called by his workmates) lends out his apartment to the married men he works with who want to entertain their extramarital flings without their wives knowledge.  This act leads to some confusion among those living in Baxter's building, garners him a bad reputation and proves to be quite the inconvenience to him, but professionally he is `moving on up'.  Then he meets the beautiful Fran Kubelik and things look as though they might move in the right direction socially for him as well; but there are still a few roadblocks he must maneuver through before he's home free.<br /><br />Jack Lemmon is irresistibly charming here.  His `loser' Baxter is endearing to the viewer.  When Fran asks why she can't fall in love with a man like him you are just jumping at the bit to convince her that he is the man for her.  Shirley MacLaine is also great as Fran, truly mysterious but in a compelling way.  She's sweet and charming and naturally and genuinely relatable.  Fred MacMurray is fantastic as Sheldrake, Baxter's boss.  He's got this genuine charm that aids to his manipulative nature and gives him a sense of reality.  He is so real.  Jack Kruschen is also great as Dr. Dreyfuss, but I would have nominated MacMurray over him if it were up to me.<br /><br />`The Apartment' is a charming movie that is funny but one cannot overlook its dramatic air.  There is a lot in this film that is `no laughing matter' so-to-speak, for it deals with some very serious subjects such as infidelity and suicide.  Thankfully writer/director Billy Wilder approaches this with candor and grace, delivering a serious film that, while not making light of the subject, manages to infuse enough honest humor to make it utterly enjoyable.uinely relatable.

B0010YSD7M|4.0|The Ark of Truth did not disappoint.  It kept me on the edge all the time, waiting to see how the story would resolve itself.  The interplay between the characters was as good as expected, and the problems were really of the impossible type...a good challange for SG-1!  I really was expecting more space battles. For a problem this big I thought they should have sent all three Daedalus class battlecruisers to the Ori Galaxy and have a big fight with some motherships; but no deal.  Overall the production values were better than your average SG1 episode and it does its job in leaving you wanting to see the next movie in the series.
B00177Y9ZC|3.0|David Rice is one of those guys who has a troubled childhood.  His mother has abandoned him when he was just a wee child.  His father is an abusive alcoholic.  To make his life worse, he's bullied at school.  There's only one bright spot in his life...his crush, Millie.<br /><br />Then, one day, he soon discovers that he can teleport.  Upon discovery, he abandons his lonely life and makes a comfortable life for himself.  However, there's a secret organization of hitmen that seeks to eliminate jumpers (teleporters) because they believe that only God should have this ability.<br /><br />The \\"cat and mouse\\" game is interesting.  The escape from the Paladin hitmen forces David to seek help from another jumper and Millie, his high school crush, whom he hasn't seen in years.<br /><br />While a fascinating movie, the story isn't quite perfect.  There's just too many loose ends, leaving you wonder how did such things start or end.  It looks like a sequel is possible.  If so, hopefully, we'll get some answers.
B000002VCT|4.0|The third Alan Parsons Project album was kind of lost in the middle of his Sci-Fi progressive epic [[ASIN:B000JLQSW4 I Robot]] and the hits that started coming once he released [[ASIN:B0012GMWJS Eve]]. It is one of the few APP albums to not notch a top 40 single. It's also the last of his truly old-school free-from FM Radio rock albums, playing heavily with the instrumentations and the concept.<br /><br />For this album, it was the Pyramid Craze and the fascination with King Tut that informed the songs. The unconventional instrumentation of \\"In The Lap Of The Gods\\" was the last time Parsons would enter into that kind of symphonic lustre, and APP's trademark instrumental style makes two appearances with \\"Hyper Gamma Spaces\\" and \\"Voyager.\\" The terrific ballads drop in with \\"Shadow of a Lonely Man\\" and Colin Blunstone's well sung \\"The Eagle Will Rise Again.\\"<br /><br />The thematic leaning towards making monuments to yourself (\\"What Goes Up\\" and \\"You Can't Take it With You\\") make for intriguing, thoughtful songs, while the goofy \\"Pyramania\\" is the song that actually does fiddle around with the Pyramid theme (and may be the most humorous thing APP ever recorded) the most. But the main theme of the album, man's quest for immortality, is the over-riding purpose of the songs. Be it our desires and doubts toward be the biggest and most noticed (\\"If all things will fall, why build a miracle at all?\\") to our own refusal to acknowledge our folly (\\"The last thing of all that was on my mind was the close at the end of the show\\" from \\"Shadow of a Lonely Man\\"), this was the last Alan Parsons Project to really touch me emotionally. While future and more popular albums ([[ASIN:B000IOM1Y6 Eye in the Sky]], [[ASIN:B000IOM1Z0 Turn of a Friendly Card]]) are still good albums overall, they were more focused on a glossy and streamlined sound. \\"Pyramid\\" was a grandiose goodbye to the 70's, and still holds a special place in my CD collection.<br /><br />So where's the remaster, already?
B0011NVC9I|3.0|Gosh, I remember reading *Beowulf* for Freshman Comp way back when I first started college.  For some reason, along with *Gilgamesh*, this story stuck with me.<br /><br />Anyways, I was looking forward to this movie to see how it would be played out in a film.  In addition, I was curious about this style of animation.  I was somewhat impressed but, at the same time, I couldn't hold my laughter.<br /><br />The scene where Beowulf stripped his clothes and slept naked while his men created noises to draw out Grendel.  I couldn't help but think of this portrayal of Beowulf as a \\"mature\\" version of Prince Charming in *Shrek*.  The attempted creative ways to cover Beowulf's manhood was just cheesy.<br /><br />Aside from that, *Beowulf* was a fresh approach on retelling the classic story.
B00104W8T6|4.0|The soundtrack is a great example of utilizing artists from the past with the music of the present to deliver an outstanding package, which works well with the moods of the movie.<br /><br />In what could be a playlist from a college radio station, there is oldies and classic rock (Buddy Holly, The Kinks and Mott the Hoople's timeless anthem, All the Young Dudes), with a solid helping of the indie scene through Sonic Youth, Cat Power, Belle & Sebastian and Kimya Dawson, as a solo artist and her bands - Antsy Pants and Moldy Peaches. The real gem - which encapsulates the film - is Michael Cera and Ellen Page on Anyone Else but You.<br /><br />By pulling music from a variety of sources, the soundtrack is a real as dialing in the college DJ on the car radio before driving out of the high school parking lot immediately after school.
B00004W55E|5.0|If you like jazz and R&B, you'll love Rachelle Ferrell and this CD. She has a range unlike anything I've heard since Minnie Riperton. Buy this CD, you won't be disappointed.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|If you like cheesy horror movies that have no focus other than 'kill the monster' and 'don't answer the phone'...this is not the movie for you.  On the other hand, if you like excellent ORIGINAL movies that keep you tense throughout and leave you wishing for hours more...this is your movie.  I became so involved with the characters that I almost forgot it was supposed to be a scary movie.  Then the monster comes and I responded with, \\"oh yeah, there's a monster in this movie\\".  Ultimately, this is a movie about PEOPLE.  About what people would do in an unthinkable situation.  While for many people this movie won't be their 'bag of chips', I maintain that many people are sheep.  This is an excellent showing of Drew Goddard's talent and what a good \\"horror\\" movie should be.
B000YKE87W|5.0|Kaufmann's artistry was new to me, and this recording was a wonderful introduction to this sensitive artist.  The performances of familiar works were all made fresh by his distinctive approach.  Will look forward to hearing more of his artistry in the future!

B000R7HY0K|1.0|Watching Death Proof is an excercise in patience as this is the most boring movie I have ever seen.  Judging by the writer/director and how good Planet Terror was, I thought Death Proof would be a blast to watch.  I was wrong and therefore subjected to about 100 minutes of alleged actors blab their way through this film.  I guess its called character development which went the way of the DoDo in the first 2 minutes.  The scenes with the cars were bordering on idiotic and again we are subjected to a pile of dialogue by the actors.  Whats Quentins thing with womens feet in almost every movie he made?<br /><br />If you own Death Proof on DVD use the case as an ashtray or coaster. If not, save your money and definitely two hours of your life and watch a test pattern instead.

1591396190|1.0|I read this book with much anticipation after some of the highly rated comments and the hype surrounding the text.    Quite a disappointment the book turned out to be. At many points of the book it was quite obvious that the authors are using flawed analytics to explain events post-hoc. The so-called strategic mapping can be so easily manipulated to give one company the desired shape as opposed to a see-saw pattern just by the ordering of the criteria on the X-axis!!! Many of the supposedly strategic \\"blue ocean\\"-creating differentiation values by the companies are by no means intentional or deliberate as the authors would liken them to be. And what of the decline of these blue ocean companies in the book in recent times? Are they suddenly in a bloody ocean in such a short span of time from the publication of the book?    Read with a fistful of salt...

B000000WZ4|5.0|it was a long and hard road for depeche mode to come back and release this album and to me they succeeded with leeps and bounds, spawning 4 hit singles in the process.     fav. songs: it's no good, insight, barrel of a gun, home.     hell, the whole things great.
B0013FBS20|4.0|I thought the film was well thought out and written (adapting it from source material).  My only hang up with the film is the CGI night creatures that plagued Robert Neville's existence.  Its was teetering on the borderline of being too cartoony.  Other than that, I loved the film.
B0011ZNAIC|2.0|Started out pretty good but then it went on a tangent about bees suing people (and apparently U.S. courts effect THE ENTIRE WORLD) and I just lost interest in it at this point.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I've always been interested in this movie, but not sure what I think of it.  Technically it has earned its award in my book, and also has earned a five star rating.  But if the stars were used in my case to reflect how much I liked it, it would be a two.  I checked it out from the library, watched the first 45 minutes, and then fast forwarded to the final half hour, seeing the trial and ending to know how things came out.<br /><br />One person rightly said there are hardly any redeemable characters in it.  The protagonist is an adulterous murderer who thinks only of herself.  It questions if there is any real judgment.<br /><br />I would compare this to \\"A Clockwork Orange\\".  Both show the depths of depravity.  The difference?  The Kuberick classic reflects the emptiness of the depravity, while \\"Chicago\\" has fun with it.<br /><br />I thought the blur between reality and fantasy was very effective, which added both to its uniqueness and its disturbing quality.  I loved the acting as well.  There were also some good points, such as the lawyer telling Rene's character that she should be happy with her freedom.  Too many people are not happy with what we should be happy with.<br /><br />One thing I missed was the conviction of the foreign girl.  I found that hanging scene very depressing, and I did miss why she was convicted.<br /><br />Another reviewer said \\"All That Jazz\\" and \\"Cell Block Tango\\" stick with you, and he was right.<br /><br />This was a well done movie, but it is one I would have been fine not seeing.  Just because it is good art does not mean it is good.
B000HC2LI0|2.0|The packaging and dvd quality are excellent, however, the subtitles are terrible-I had to turn them off and use my TV captions. The subtitles on the discs are abbreviated and often summarize incorrectly the words being spoken-and, after all, the series was wonderful because of the words being spoken. They've done a disservice to the hearing impaired.

B000R7HY0K|4.0|This is the version of the grindhouse experience that went up in the cinemas in Sweden, the doublebill version didn't get shown which at least I would have liked to have seen and it's also not coming out on DVD, so I can not compare this extended version with the cinema version with the missing reels. But this is a tour de force that never releases it's grip on it's audience with it's full speed ahead mentality. Kurt Russell delivers one of his best perfomances ever and Quentin Tarantiono's direction, script and choice of music propels this film into a frenzied ending where the young women he has been terrorizing on the road gives him his just punishment.  If you like films such as [[ASIN:B0007WQGR2 Dirty Mary Crazy Larry (Supercharger Edition)]] or [[ASIN:B00013RC8O Vanishing Point]]this is highly recommended.  Added May 8,  I have just seen the excellent japanese 6 disc \\"Grindhouse - the complete box\\" which includes the US theatrical release version as well as the extended versions of \\"Death Proof and \\"Planet Terror\\" the presentation of the films is excellent the DVD's looks like old vinyl albums and the box is dressed with lobby cards for both features. Now that I have finally seen the theatrical cut of the film, I can't understand why it wasn't exhibited here in Sweden, as it is an excellent piece of filmmaking and I give it a rating of ****½.   It is available from amazon.co.jp,but is Region 2 encoded so it won't playback on US (Region 1) DVD players.

B00014TJ7K|5.0|From the first note to the last, this is an exceptional recording.  The compositions, lyrics, rhythm section and soloists all shine throughout.  George Harrison's voice has rarely sounded better.  And he's as clean a bottleneck guitar player as anyone I've heard.  The sound quality of the recording couldn't be improved upon.<br /><br />These performances come from the hearts of musicians famous for their ability to wear their hearts on their sleeves.  Essential listening for all pop music fans.
0393324818|5.0|Lewis somehow manages to make a book about statistics and payrolls interesting by turning it into a character piece. Makes me wish Billy Beane was the GM of my favorite team. My only criticism is that the book applauds the Oakland A's for signing players who overperform, but in hindsight, we know half the Bay Area was juicing during the period the book was written.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is an awesome workout!  Not for beginners.  I wasn't sure what I would think of her.  I find her kind of annoying on the show, but I like her no-nonsense attitude.  So after two weeks I've lost 4 lbs and jeans are getting looser.  I've been doing the workout everyday (minus 1) for two straight weeks.  It is HARD, don't be fooled by 20 minutes.  However, it is short enough that even a full-time working, busy mother can squeeze in a workout EVERY DAY.  I am not bored at all. With 3 workouts and the option to use heavier weights - this one will keep you going for awhile. She takes her time explaining and giving you enough time to properly do each move.  I really like that she doesn't rush through sit-ups and emphasizes form.  I wish the cool down was longer, but I just stretch for a few more minutes after the video is done.  This is the best $13 I've spent in awhile.  :)

B000062XGD|5.0|\\"Castaway\\" (with Tom Hanks) was a good movie until the end, when it grabs the brass ring of greatness (in my humble opinion).<br /><br />It wasn't enough that he survived the island.  (And remember, he didn't get out by just hanging on;  he found a way to get beyond the reef.)  He must now decide if he is going to survive the loss of the love of his life.<br /><br />If you have ever realized you let go of a great love, then you understood what was great about it.  You have the chance to take that realization, growth, and self-awareness to your next relationship, making it worlds better that the first.  But its not that easy.<br /><br />It takes courage to move on and trust that the future contains unknown miracles. Ironically, that courage may be the thing your next love finds most attractive about you.<br /><br />I absolutely adore the last scene.  He is literally at a crossroads in the middle of nowhere.  He must chose between a misery to which he is completely entitled, or once again, scraping together whatever courage he can find.<br /><br />I imagine that he turns his car around, and drives back toward the woman with the wings (another great metaphor).  We don't know if they start a relationship.  But it doesn't really matter because we know he will continue to find the courage to move on.<br /><br />Of course, I imagine that they do.  I imagine that she initially sees him as an odd, mildly attractive man of her own age.  They discuss the package he left at her door, which leads to an offer of iced tea and a  discussion of his experience on the island which takes all afternoon and into the evening.  Afterwards, she can no longer see his face as clearly as she can see his heart.

B000N4SADC|5.0|Hiromi's star continues to rise with this album.  This is one sizzling quartet, with all the chops to make her compositions breathe fire, and yet all the passion to keep it genuinely human and warm.  Let's run down the track list:    The opening of \\"Time Difference\\" seems at first to harken back to Rick Wakeman's prototypic \\"Six Wives of Henry VIII\\".  But the pot is stirred very early on, with lots of slithering, microtonal dialogue between Hiromi and guitarist Fiuczynski.   On balance, a wonderfully virtuoso opening for the album.    \\"Time Out\\" is a rollicking up-tempo shuffle with an infectious sense of fun, even as it revels in its dissonances.  Some great solo work by Fiuczynski here.    \\"Time Travel\\" is a complex episodic work.  The feeling of floating exhilaration at the beginning (nice solo work from Grey) gives way to a caffeinated drum riff whose challenge is soon taken up by the rest of the group with zeal.  The highlights throughout this composition are too numerous to list, but my personal favorite is Hiromi's distortion-laced Rhodes solo (both a rarity and a delight).    The wistful \\"Deep Into the Night\\" brings us down to earth with what begins as a soulful ballad, but eventually slips into \\"power ballad\\" territory.  There is drama here, but it is never overblown.  Lovely work all around, though there was a moment or two I wish might have been mixed with as much care as the artists were pouring into it.    \\"Real Clock vs. Body Clock = Jet Lag\\" returns the sense of edgy fun to the proceedings.  For some reason, this composition seems like the kindred spirit of Bela Fleck's \\"Couch Potato\\" to me, what with all the mercurial moods swings and broad humor.    \\"Time and Space\\" is a loping (and occasionally lurching) minimalist groove in search of a melody.  Though it veers dangerously close to filler territory, there are some tasty solos that redeem the track's diffidence.    \\"Time Control, Or Controlled By Time\\" begins as a furious tarantella, but alternatesmoods several times during its eight-and-a-half minutes.  The centerpiece is a remarkable solo from drummer Valihora, capped off with another excellent piano solo excursion.    \\"Time Flies\\" returns to the sense of the ethereal, introduced by a keening whistle-like solo that seems suspended in time alongside lush piano chords.  Eventually the track reveals a ballad-rock mood whose chorus takes me back to, of all things, vintage early-80's Yellowjackets (my musical equivalent of comfort food, in other words).  Even after eight minutes, I didn't want this track to end.    Finally, \\"Time's Up\\" closes the book on this gem of an album in a manner totally appropriate to the proceedings.    This was my very first Hiromi purchase... though I have also purchased \\"Brain\\" and \\"Spiral\\" since then, I keep coming back to \\"Time Control\\".  I expect it to stay in my CD changer well beyond her next release (which is due pretty soon now).
B00127RAJY|4.0|I have only done the 1st set of 20 minutes of exercise and it gives a great all around workout - I'm very impressed with it - the only slight drawback is that you have to listen to the introduction every time - you aren't able to fast forward through it - that gets a little old.

B000YRY8BG|5.0|I really enjoyed this Miniseries!  I would love to see more Movies like this made!  The acting was well done by all cast members!   This Miniseries has a little bit of everything that makes for a great story that will keep you going and wanting more each Episode.    Mystery, Suspense, Murder, Romance, and that great dry British Humor here and there to make it even more fun and appealing.  It has a lot of twists and turns within the story to throw you off and keep you guessing till the shocking end! I'm not giving it away!   But keep a hanky handy.  I let a friend borrow it, she told me today she just started the first Episode. She's hooked and already loves it!

B00127RAJY|5.0|I am a 38 yr old male, I never could see myself doing an exercise dvd..until now. I lost 40 lbs last yr by watching my food intake and walking 3 miles per day, finally my weight loss stalled so I thought i would mix it up with a video. I purchased this one and did it for the first time Saturday morning...my legs are still sore, which means its working. I feel I'll have no problem losing my last 20lbs with the help of this video.<br /><br />It's pretty quick paced but it hits on almost everything and it taught me some exercise's that I can do without the video, at night while watching TV, during a commercial i'll just get on the floor and go 20 crunch's or so.<br /><br />Weight loss is not easy and you have to want it, if you truely want to lose weight I feel this video will help you, but nothing will help unless you really want it and watch what you eat. Working on strength, cardio and abs all in 20 mins is great for someone like me that works 10-12 hrs a day and has 3 kids at home...its quick yet effective. Do your self a favor and get the dvd and never look back!<br /><br />UPDATE: I have been doing this for 5 days now and have lost 4 1/2 pounds! I am so glad I decided to get this dvd, you will be too.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I greatly enjoyed the John Adams HBO Miniseries. I am going to miss watching. I thought it was a wonderful depiction of life during this time period. Like others, this show made me more interested in learning more.  I intend to read the book that was based on the miniseries. I wish there more shows like this on TV that are worth watching. I also, thought that the acting was excellent and ofcourse Tom Hanks did a great job.

B0010YSD7M|4.0|This is a good video. For SG1 fans, it will be most enjoyable. In fact the way it was produced/edited is more like a feature film. The difference is subtle but it is there. Possibly it's to make the video more appealing to those unfamiliar with series as well. But this just my hunch. I'm not a movie expert.<br /><br />If your an SG1 fan or just a sci-fi fan, it's worth the purchase price.<br /><br />Bill Swingle<br />Janesville, CA
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I would have preferred another season, but I'll take what I can get. This was a great wrap up of the story line as well as a good edition to my SG-1 DVD collection.    I'll be waiting for the next opportunity to drop some dollars on the next SG-1 DVD coming in the summer.
B000002KHF|3.0|I like Van, and this is a pretty good CD,I guess. I just find that I'm not that motivated to listen to it very often. Moondance has been played to death and the rest of the songs are just okay to me. Actually, most of Van's stuff is just okay. This CD's best songs are at the beginning, the songs diminish in quality as the CD progresses. As usual, the lyrics are never beyond servicable. Van has a tendency to write rhymes instead of interesting lyrics. \\"These dreams of you. So real and so true\\", \\"Everyone, everyone, everyone ,everyone\\", \\"And it stoned me to my soul, stoned me just like going home\\". Not very inspiring, or interesting. It's a nice Sunday morning CD, I suppose, but not as good as Astral Weeks--another CD with its share of bad lyrics. \\"As I venture in the slipstream between the viaducts of your dream.\\" Pretentious and sometimes, unintentionally funny. You're better off downloading individual songs form Van's catalog. His CDs are just too spotty.
B000NVI1IO|5.0|AC/DC proves again why they are ROCK N ROLL giants.  With a stong single \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\" and awesome tracks like \\"Safe In New York City\\" & Satallite Blues this album is a real ROCK N ROLL winner all the way threw.  Solid musicianship, solid production, and simply solid no BS ROCK!
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|At first, I was a bit worried when I heard that Lady M was collaborating with so many hip-hop masters.  I wanted Madonna to stay true to herself, even if it meant - as she constantly does - reinventing her image, style, and music. Now that I've gotten the new CD, I am more than relieved - I am thrilled with this album.<br /><br />Sure, \\"Four Minutes\\" is a loud, silly, hypnotic mess of a hit. But it's not really characteristic of the rest of the songs.  \\"Give it to Me\\" (the second single) is another assault on the senses while still being undeniably catchy.<br /><br />However, I am really most impressed with \\"Miles Away\\" (poignant, heartbreaking, and still entertaining; it updates the \\"Cherish\\" era with modern sonic appeal while adding a little of the vibe of the recent hit \\"Apologize\\"), \\"Incredible\\" (which takes the listener on a mad, wonderful, dance journey), \\"She's not Me\\" (retro mixed with edge and a rather biting lyric) and \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" - which definitely shows the influence of Justin Timberlake in a good way.<br /><br />\\"Miles Away\\" and \\"She's not Me\\" seem to comment on Madonna's own relationship with Guy and offer some rare insight into her own world while still maintaining an upbeat and commercial sensibility. Madonna, thankfully, might have moments of reflection - but she never loses the urge to dance and avoids the potential of being maudlin.<br /><br />Overall, Madonna has given us hooks galore and seems to be doing an homage to her first, classic, self-titled album while also keeping things innovative and contemporary. Sure, she's using hit-makers of the day - but she's making them work for her and serve her own vision first.  Bravo to Her Madgesty!<br /><br />Lawrence Stern
B00009MGR6|5.0|AC/DC proves once again they are ROCK N Roll Monsters!  Love the cover art on this album is very nestalgic.  The 80's gave us two great things:  thrash metal and more AC/DC albums that stayed true to their pure rock sound rather than going bubble gum/manufactured \\"rock\\" like Def LEppard or Motley Crue.  Hail AC/DC!!!  Solid release, great songs, great remaster.
1401300529|3.0|I found the opening chapter of this book, which depicts the US soldiers blindly stumbling into well-prepared Chinese ambushes, to be utterly engrossing. Unfortunately, Halberstam couldn't keep it up through the book.    As a nice survey of the first few years of the Korean War and its underlying causes, this is a good book, but while Halberstam does a good job going into the political causes, with long chapters detailing the motives of MacArthur, Truman, Stalin, and Mao, I was disappointed that he didn't spend more time with the soldiers who were on the ground. Their stories were far more compelling, but Halberstam doesn't spend nearly enough time with them.     In addition, he glosses over the last few years of the war and the public's growing disaffection with it.     As a starting point for learning more about Korea, this works pretty well, but I thought the lack of clear focus was a disappointment.
B000089RV6|5.0|This album came together after the untimley death of Bon Scott.  After aquiring a new singer in Brian Johnson they set out to make an album that would be a salute to Bon, this was that album.  The songs are amazing and still rock staples to this day, the production is great, the performance captures the energy of AC/DC perfectly and the vocals are intense.  Amazing album and one of the best selling ever that actually deserves it.....
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|\\"We really wanted to sound like ourselves but not sound like ourselves. It was always going to be difficult.\\" - Geoff Barrow, Pitchfork Media interview, Apr. 7, 2008.<br /><br />Geoff Barrow and the rest of Portishead had every reason in the world to feel this way. When Dummy debuted in 1994, it didn't sound like anything else and wasn't even expected to sell 50,000 copies. It's hard to believe in this day and age, but Dummy's dark, torchy pop punctuated with hip-hop beats and swimming in a sea of bass had never before been co-opted by anyone--not even Massive Attack, who had approached trip-hop from more of a dance perspective. It blew up, sparking a trip-hop genesis in alt-rock circles looking for a viable (and similarly angst-ridden) alternative to grunge, especially in the States. Now, of course, Dummy's sound is everywhere, from the umpteen upstart trip-hop bands that subsequently appeared to spy films, cocktail parties and massage therapy commercials. So we would be forgiven for not being bowled over by Dummy today, and Portishead would be forgiven for wanting to distance themselves from it.<br /><br />When last we heard from Portishead, it seemed as though they were packing it in for good, leaving us with a slightly less fresh self-titled album in 1997 and a live recording at Manhattan's Roseland Ballroom in 1998 before retreating into the shadows. Always something of an enigma and quite shy of the press, it was left to us to assume that Portishead was frustrated with how their crown jewel had been assimilated and watered-down, and that they were too daunted by the challenge that Barrow mentioned above to record a third album: How do you sound like yourself and not sound like yourself? All of which makes Third--a record that wasn't even supposed to exist--such a cryptically dazzling triumph. Third is no Dummy: It's much bleaker, makes precious few references to pop, and attains a level of creepiness that Dummy's strangest song, \\"Wandering Star,\\" only suggested. Yet one listen to Third is all it takes to realize that nobody else is making music quite like this, and this is how Portishead still sound like themselves. In fact, hearing Third in 2008 may clue us into what it was like to hear Dummy in 1994.<br /><br />Counterintuitive as it may seem, the first thing to do when approaching Third is to forget about trip-hop and all the associations it carries. Barrow's drums stay far, far away from a hip-hop swagger; rather than providing a backbone, these diverse rhythms teeter on edge with the rest of the music and add another ominous layer to the mix. \\"Plastic\\" uses amped, clipped drum rolls that send the song screeching to a halt about a dozen times, and \\"We Carry On\\" is driven by a scary tom-led tribal stomp (Morcheeba this isn't). Barrow doesn't cop out by adding bassy undercurrents for cheap mystery; instead, he punches up the compression and keeps the sound trebly and brittle, giving the impression that everything is flying right at you even when the songs stand still. Third may be stubbornly unsexy, but that doesn't mean it's not alluring. Indeed, it wields an odd magnetic power that draws the listener ever further into its disorienting abyss, even when all of the elements jump bluntly out of the speakers.<br /><br />By the same token, Third's allure doesn't make it an easy listen, and it can be particularly heady when experienced in one straight pass. The sequencing feels all wrong, moving up and down and up again in the most unsettling of ways. After the distorted anti-song \\"Silence\\" kicks the record off, Portishead dips into the heavily narcotized haunted house of \\"Hunter,\\" where Beth Gibbons' vocals drift sleepily and hypnotically through the arrangement. \\"We Carry On\\" is followed by the 90-second respite \\"Deep Water,\\" which sounds like Gibbons fronting the Ink Spots over a ukulele melody, before being gunned down by the incessant staccato rapid-firing of \\"Machine Gun.\\" Through it all, Gibbons sings like an innocent bystander; divorced from and frightened by the music around her, she becomes our stand-in for its unfamiliar territory. She contributes little to the record compositionally and melodically, but remove her and obliterate a sizable chunk of Third's emotional punch.<br /><br />The members of Portishead are noted experimentalists, but they don't just make cool sounds for fun. The backward-looped guitar on \\"Nylon Smile,\\" the warped ascending scales on \\"Hunter,\\" and the many other weird noises that crop up on Third contain an element of caution like aural barbed wire: As unpleasant as they may be, they're there to keep us from venturing somewhere truly dangerous. The creepy Portuguese television program that begins \\"Silence\\" seems appropriate, since listening to Third can feel as though we're tuning into a channel that we're not meant to know about or watch. I imagine that trip-hop in its nascent form--Massive Attack's Mezzanine, Tricky's Maxinquaye, and yes, Portishead's Dummy--was originally meant to invoke this sort of forbidden underworld, but that somewhere down the road the plot got lost, and its darkness and foreboding turned into something more manageable, fashionable and marketable. By rescuing trip-hop from a fate of Banana Republic soundtracks and putting their extremely personal stamp on a tired genre, Portishead have re-established themselves not simply as masters of their craft, but as reinventors of it.frightened by the music around her, she becomes our stand-in for its unfamiliar territory.

The setlist on here is excellent, the performance is second to none and fully captures AC/DC's live energy.

0307265730|2.0|Don't get me wrong--I think Jhumpa Lahiri has a way with words and telling stories as was evident in her first book, Interpreter of Maladies.  Interpreter was like a breath of fresh air with short stories that truly helped a reader transcend to human reaches of pain, joy, disappointment, hope and many other emotions.  I think that the writer is great at short stories, horrid at the long novel (I was tremendously let down with The Namesake) but needs to change up the formula.<br />I was excited that Jhumpa Lahiri was coming out with a book of short stories again but upon reading the first few stories, I was nothing short of crestfallen.  Although the stories themselves are not written badly, I am getting really tired of the same old formula she's using.  It seems like almost every one of her stories revolves around Boston, involves an American-born Indian struggling with either their own culture or a family member, and of course involves Indian parents and their struggle coming to America.  OK I get it already!<br />These stories didn't provide any new insight, I felt, that she didn't already communicate to me with Interpreter of Maladies.  I ended up getting really bored and tired of her always leaving stories hanging with no resolution in sight.  Some of the stories almost seemed pointless (the last one in the book is a prime example) to even write.  After writing about having such emotion and turning around and completely ignoring that emotion just to have the character regret seems so tiresome, trite and overdone in her books.<br />The writer is obviously talented and I am not knocking on her ability to write mellifluously--however her stories need a breath of fresh air so I don't feel like I'm reading the same story that has been slightly altered 10X.

B0012Q732O|4.0|The entire film is basically a manned up version of a chick flick. a would give it 5 stars but it was not the film people expected it to be, there for 4 stars. I loved the Special FX and the epic scale of the story and the many creatures of the past. but its NOT an ACTION EPIC. A new thing for Roland Emmerich.<br /><br />The story is a young couple is jerpordized when the young woman is captured by slavers. The man of course will not let them get away with it and follows them around the world until coming upon a civilization ruled by a false god who uses countless slaves to do his bidding. The main character units many tribes ravaged by this evil and puts together a rag-tag army to overthrough the god and free all the slaves including his beloved.<br /><br />Like i said the film is basicaly a male version of a chick flick. Loads of FX driven action and spectacular visuals \\"10,000 B.C.\\" actually has nothing to do with any time period, rather its takes the best from many periods and puts them together in one film. It works but it is misleading.<br />The action is all because of one mans love for his woman and his undying quest to be free with her.
B00008WT5M|5.0|This was the third coming of AC/DC in the early 90's.  The whole album is packed full of great classic songs that still get the place jumping today.  Very well put together, amazing song writing, great sound quality and generation defining songs.

Do not ever doubt MANA.  Their enthusiasm for their music comes out loud and clear.  The vocals are great; the sound quality is great; the drumming, the vocals; DAMN!!! The only complaint I have is the setlist.  I wished they would have played more songs in this concert live c.d.  They have so many more classic songs they could've performed.

I love Mana's music and always will, but to the record companys..PLEASE DON'T CUT THE FANS SHORT!!!     The 2 new songs on the album are classic Mana...These guys just put out hit after hit....    What about Alex's drum solo as well or Sergio's guitar solo?

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Always controversial but never strays from the absolute truth. Moore's films are always evocative and anyone watching this and only seeing political agenda really isn't watching it for any other reason. PBS recently did a similar report about comparing and contrasting the health care institutions of different nations. Though PBS showed more examples of different styles of health care institutions, the bottom line for both documentaries is that American health care system needs serious overhauling.
B00005QAPH|5.0|Many previous reviews, by those who appreciate this film, I wholeheartedly agree with.  I will refrain from repeating the praise and reiterating Fellini's motivation behind making this film and simply explain what made this movie a joy for me, personally:  This was my first Fellini film and it was an absolute pleasure to watch.  As an artist myself, and having an appreciation for films and the creative process as a whole, I found this film to be inspiring, humorous and unique.  I admire Fellini's ability to carefully weave dream, memory, and the \\"present\\" so cohesively and with such fluidity - it's a great juggling act that is masterfully crafted and eye opening to experience.  I respect Fellini for the honesty and for the soul he has poured into this film - and furthermore, I appreciate his masterful ability to express it.  If you love film, if you love art, if you love the creative process and want to watch a movie that beautifully celebrates the magic of creation itself, I could not recommend this movie more.
0143034901|5.0|I finished this book at precisely 1:15am this morning. That is about 36 hours after I started reading it. I couldn't put it down, but I had to in order to do tasks such as eating, bathing, and going to work! The first thing I did this morning was to open this book from the very beginning and once again, enter the haunting world of The Shadow of the Wind. It's a heartbreaking tale that twists and subplots down the most awesome rabbit holes. I loved every single page and laughed out loud through Zafon's amazing and colorful voice. This is a must, MUST, MUST read that you will never forget. The best thing is of course...The End.

B000ZN802W|5.0|Into the Wild is one of those movies whose images stay with you after the screen goes dark. This is a tribute to the subject-- a tragic and confused young pseudo idealist, Christopher McCandless-- and Sean Penn and his crew.<br /><br />McCandless has just graduated from Emory University. He's bright, well-liked, talented, the world is his for the taking-- it seems. Then he chucks it all, burns his money, abandons his vehicle, donates his graduate school fund to charity and hits the road. He's a leatherfoot, hoofing all across the country from Atlanta to South Dakota, on to California and finally to his goal of the utopian loner's dream world of \\"Alaska\\". Alaska is quoted here because it represents far more for McCandless than just a remote place full of emptiness and nature. It represents the \\"wild\\" - that gorgeous and challenging place where he can find himself, or so he thinks.<br /><br />He's on a wild goose chase with himself but doesn't quite understand or realize it. He thinks he's stuffing life and experience and learning into all the time that he has-- he's abandoned everything including his sister and parents. In fact, he refuses to communicate with them at all. Their heartbreak, worry, fears, and frustrations are with us the viewer at all times and we wonder (as do a few characters in the film) silently, \\"how can he do this to them\\"?<br /><br />Chris hits the road hard. He takes odd jobs, and goes from frustrated relationship to the next one. But they always are frustrating because he simply will not give of himself. They aren't frustrating for him, but for those who want to befriend him. His search for personal meaning is truly little more than an avoidance of his own personal demons, mostly from his parents' history and rocky marriage. He is surrounded by love, people who want him, his company, his brilliance and soft, caring approach to the world. He is attractive to others, but he loathes himself somehow. In the wilds of the Alaskan wilderness he thinks he will find what he is looking for and he does, but not in the way that he expected.<br /><br />Again and again, people that Chris meets offer their friendship to him and sometimes their love. But he cannot accept it. Something in him prevents him from accepting love or truly giving it. Perhaps it would be contrary to the loner path that he'd chosen?<br /><br />This is a sad story, so beautifully filmed. The acting is spot on, too.<br /><br />Hal Holbrook plays an old man with a painful secret of his own. He knows that Chris and he are two of a kind and need each other. We in the audience also know this. Holbrook is Chris' chance for stability and a home, the true path to insight for someone whose core issues are built upon a perceived betrayal and lack of love from others, mainly his parents. It's a hard moment for the viewer when Chris walks away from Holbrook abandoning another fortunate opportunity for healing and happiness, but it is not so hard for Chris whose focus is solely on getting to his personal nirvana that he understands and expects Alaska to be.<br /><br />Alaska is a beautiful but challenging place. Superbly filmed, it is easy to see how Chris would want to be there, challenge himself and try to find himself, alone-- try to find a way to fit in with others which is truly the issue-- alone.<br /><br />The exact cause of Chris' death is not fully known. The book's author and Penn both make the case the McCandless accidentally poisoned himself. But later tests on the suspected plant material recovered from his camp site cast serious doubt on this theory as no poison was found.  According to the diaries that he left behind he had decided to return to civilization but a raging river full of spring melt prevented him from doing so. He stayed in his camp, wasting away. But only a mile away was a perfectly usable crossing, and less than half a mile away was a still part of the river where he could have fished to his heart's content with only his hands asthe fish were so plentiful there. But he did neither and apparently chose to stay and face his demons and his new understandings alone.<br /><br />It is not clear if Chris is a hero-- the lone introvert heading into the wilderness akin to Thoreau to find the \\"truth\\", or rather a spoiled city boy with only ignorance and dreams and personal pain and perhaps some mental illness driving him on.<br /><br />The locals in the wilds of Alaska often speak of such people who come to Alaska to find themselves, swollen with pride like the rivers full of melting snows. And they have little respect for them, as they tempt fate and the extreme wilderness and usually lose.<br /><br />McCandless affected everyone he met in a positive way. His writings are those of a young man still trying to understand but so deeply haunted by something he could only identify at the very end that was at the heart of his troubles. The tears of his parents, his friends, and even his own at the end are palatable in this beautiful film by Sean Penn.<br /><br />This is a deeply troubling story of someone who so needed help, was offered it-- but would not or could not accept it.<br /><br />The world is full of Chris McCandlesses going about their daily routines. And perhaps this is why his story has such resonance for so many. He chose to break out of the life he was living, a life that gave him no comfort or solace-- and stride into the unknown to find one that worked for him. It may be a loner's story or a vagabond's tale, but there is a universality about the demons that haunted Chris, and his single-minded yet unfortunate response to them.<br /><br />There is no glory here, and little to reflect upon but the pain of someone who is unable to stop, unable to find another path-- until his dream of Alaska and the wilderness with all its perils was met and its lessons pulled from it at whatever the cost. This is a superb film.pparently chose to stay and face his demons and his new understandings alone.

Great personal stories and filled with incredibly useful information that's boiled down to useful little nuggets rather than running on for page after page of dribble.<br /><br />As a professional photographer I only expect a single \\"aha\\" from any book I read.  This had dozens!  I'm so impressed I may attend one of his workshops.
0765316978|4.0|...by adding my voice to it. I discovered John Scalzi via word of web right here on Amazon and took a chance on the first in this series \\"Old Man's War\\".   I loved it so much I went right for \\"Ghost Brigades\\" and got all Summer of '67 on that one, too.  So, \\"The Last Colony\\" was next in the deck and, surprisingly, turned out to be my favorite of the trio.   Now I'd give all three books four stars but Scalizi's Zelazny-esque wicked sense of humor and lean but bomb-pumped prose really shines on this, the latest in the series.   I was going to say \\"last\\" (seeing as how he alluded to it being so in his  acknowledgments) but I see (Yay!) that another book \\"Zoe's Tale\\" is scheduled to be published in August of this year.  Happy, that makes me.     If you love Military SF with heart, soul and humor you will love all three of the books in this series.   An aside, you might wonder why I didn't give them five stars? Well, as wonderful as they are I tend to save that fifth shiner for books that I will read a billion times over a lifetime. Books like \\"Lord of Light\\", \\"Neuromancer\\" and \\"Dune\\" get my cinco de starro ratings, but it doesn't mean that Scalzi's books aren't superb reads...because trust me, they are.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|It's hard to beat a hot dance track poured over sexy,suggestive lyrics... a trademark strength Madonna shows off well (with a wink) in her latest CD, Hard Candy which once again, delights/appalls the planet with a fashion-fetish-inspired cover crotch-shot...can YOU think of a better way to save the world's adorable orphans?!!!Her new sound is inspired by the \\"back in the day\\" hypnotic dance beats of the Philly/Soul-Train era club scene. Always living in the 'now', Madonna's usually bankable instincts to pick the \\"it\\" talent of the moment to enhance her musical output has kept her work well ahead of others in her over crowded genre...with ever younger, lip-glossed lolitas ready to arch their backs and coo for the masses and foaming-at-the-mouth-hungry to sign that zillion dollar contract! On Hard Candy,she's incorporated the urban R-n-B style sounds and sexy, macho-hip-hop energy of three hot music men Pharrell, Timbaland and Timberlake and by doing so, insured that her music stays current, fresh and vibrant. She admitted to having to share \\"diva-space\\" with the three younger, in-demand hotties (a first for her), but it paid off ,in spite of all the scheduling/ego dramas.  The first three dance tracks totally hit the mark and are impossible not to move to followed by a few softer, but still very strong, tracks offers a perfect groovey-loungey mood. Upon repeated hearings,the tracks grow on you fast. Just don't overthink the lyrics,just enjoy it for what it is...what it's been.Afterall, \\"bubblegum\\" is always sold in a \\"candy shop\\".As she's stated in her promos for this CD, there's always room to have fun (and dance-damnit!) dispite all the negative energy in these chaotic times.I can easily see some of these tracks being played on and on and on during the endless pride marches, rally's and parties this june 08.The sugar-dance-pop loving target crowd all lit-up for a diva bragging \\" got no boundaries and no limits, if there's excitment put me in it, if it's against thelaw, arrest me, if you can handle it, undress me...give it 2 me\\" YEAH!!!! A very dancable, upbeat final CD after her 25 years at Warner. Sweet exit
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Don't start this unless you have time to watch all 4 hours at once.  You won't be able to turn it off!  Simply wonderful!  The acting is fabulous.  Richard Armitage as John Thornton is a very brooding, passionate character.  I hate to say it, but he's better than Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy!  If you liked Pride and Predjudice, this is a must have.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|\\"Hard Candy\\" is not \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" but it's just as good and appealing. Madonna strikes out again to conquer the dance floor with songs that have a more urban flavor to them but remains true to her pop roots. I'd say many of the songs keep with a disco/throw-back sound without the sound effects and overly-processed voices from her past few albums of the 2000s. Best yet, Madonna really does shine in this effort by offering a sampling of songs that are upbeat, fun, containing hidden gems and surprises that'll satisfy most listeners.<br /><br />While I felt `4 Minutes' was a weak song (though catchy and entertaining) and featured Justin Timberlake more than it did her, the other songs on \\"Hard Candy\\" are far better and classic Madonna. The best songs are those produced by Pharrell and The Neptunes who really offer her a fresh sound with great dance beats. `Heartbeat' is a must listen with the great Madonna message of embracing dance as a way of salvation and ignoring the hang ups that come with age. It also contains a great breakdown section, something that's new for Madonna and adds a new edge to her songs produced by this group. `Give it 2 Me' is very pop and in-your-face, anthem-like with Madonna proclaiming she can't be stopped. `Miles Away' offers the album a great pop ballad, perhaps her best ballad since the \\"American Life\\" track `Love Profusion'.<br /><br />The other tracks are fun and keep from being filler tracks. The only track that I'm not entirely sold on is `Spanish Lesson' though it contains a great breakdown with Madonna taking on the school-master persona and demanding we the listeners do our homework and she'll give us more work. The album begins to step away from the dance theme with the last two tracks, offering an odd but still entertaining serious view of Madonna. I thought `Voices' was a near epic song and good choice to close out this chapter of her career, with Madonna asking who really is in control and ending with church bells rather than the clicking clocks that run throughout \\"Confessions on a Dancefloor\\" and this album.<br /><br />In all, this was definitely a pleasant surprise. If you're afraid this is Madonna mid-life crisis attempt to compete with big artist of right now, don't. Though she works with some big names in Hip-Hop, this is just as pop as \\"Confessions\\" and fun and dance-like, with Madonna being less preachy and simply giving us more to dance to than to think about. Some of the Timbaland/Justin Timberlake tracks do seem a bit tame and lacking the fun, light spirit Pharrell and The Neptunes injected into her songs, but in all, it's good. \\"Hard Candy\\" offers a little something for everyone, just as the lead song suggests. This is one cd you'll want to add to your collection and thus far one of the best to come out in 2008 thus far.clicking clocks that run throughout \\"Confessions on a Dancefloor\\" and this album.

B0016QNSFQ|5.0|There are no genuine philosophical problems Wittgenstein assures us. It is philosophers who create so-called philosophical problems by confusing themselves with words and misusing language. All philosophy can offer us then is a kind of therapy which can get us over these linguistic confusions.<br /><br />But there sure are problems in life. There are scientific problems for one. And there are also ethical problems. There are religious problems. Wittgenstein has problems with himself and this is comically explored by the celebrated director Derek Jarman and with a script penned by influential literary critic Terry Eagleton.<br /><br />It is basically a play. There are some props and costumes and all of it is shot inside with nothing but black backgrounds. The English actor (Karl Johnson) is a veritable Wittgenstein look-a-like, does the accent perfectly (as far as I can tell), and also does a very fine job capturing the intensity of the tortured genius. All other performers are engaging and among the historical figures that we encounter are Bertrand Russell and John Maynard Keynes.<br /><br />Definitely of interest to anyone fascinated by the eccentric, and somewhat mad, legendary genius philosopher and not to be missed by any fan of Jarman. It's about time this little cinematic gem \\"Wittgenstein\\" is available on DVD.<br /><br />See Terry Eagleton's comments on the making of this film which can be found in his _Figures of Dissent_.
B0016HNOXQ|4.0|Imagine yourself lost in a shiny steel labyrinth, walking and running<br />in the silence, the sense of someone or something after you and the<br />feeling of dread that stirs. That is the feeling one gets from<br />listening to \\"Third\\", the aptly titled long awaited third album from<br />UK Trip hop trio Portishead. Lead singer Beth Gibbons has still got<br />her high pitched spidery voice, which perfectly contrasts the bleak,<br />stripped soundscape provided by Geoff Barrow and Adrian Utley.<br /><br />The album sounds like the soundtrack to some classy horror flick,<br />(something like the Nicole Kidman movie \\"The others\\") where nothing<br />happens most of the time, but you keep expecting something to.<br />Desolate, skeletal beats, scraping noises, the tiniest of electronic<br />flourishes, their ten years away obviously wasn't spent studying their<br />peers on the pop charts. If you're looking for something sunny, catchy<br />and upbeat, I'm afraid you picked the wrong CD!<br /><br />\\"Wounded and afraid/Inside my head \\"Gibbons wails on the largely<br />instrumental opening cut \\"Silence\\" and with that, you're ushered into<br />their musical lair. Lead-off single, the aptly titled \\"Machine gun\\"<br />sets Gibbons' desolate vocals against a staccato of percussion and<br />dark strings. \\"Hunter\\" is a moody ballad, \\"Deep water\\" is a brief<br />cabaret/showtune-style song with backing harmonies that sound like a<br />foghorn, while bursts of edgy guitars erupt every so often in \\"We<br />carry on\\".<br /><br />My favourites are \\"The rip\\" (which starts off as a haunting piano<br />ballad with a droning synth build up midway) and the melodic \\"Magic<br />doors\\" (which has a sax break that sounds like lots of disembodied<br />saxophones being played backwards).<br /><br />While not as instant and melodic as their brilliant debut \\"Dummy\\"<br />(most of the CD sounded alike to me at first), this is one that will<br />definitely grow on you if you let it. Dread was never so inviting.
3832790810|5.0|To say this book is massive is a understatement. You get your $70 worth on this one. Production values are really high. The paper stock is thick and lush. The photography is beyond words. The women are amazing. Nothing to fault here.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|Determined to make a bigger splash in the US (despite the quite<br />respectable sales of her last CD), Madonna ropes in two teams of the<br />hottest producers, Timbaland, Danja and Timberlake on one hand, and<br />Pharrell Williams on the other. \\"Hard candy\\" is Mrs Ritchie's 11th<br />studio album, and I must confess, when I heard with whom she would be<br />working, I half feared the result would be some anonymous sounding Hip<br />hop/R&B.<br /><br />I needn't have worried. The only songs leaning in that direction are<br />the first two (\\"Candy shop\\" and \\"4 minutes\\"), everything else sounds<br />more like the stuff she's done on her last 4 albums. It's very much a<br />dance/electronic album with lyrics generally about love and dancing,<br />and it reminds me of Britney's last album which was done by the same<br />teams (minus Timberlake). The mood is upbeat (there are no real<br />ballads), and according to Pharrell, she pitted both teams against<br />each other to see which came up with the better product.<br /><br />At twelve tracks, she keeps it nice and sweet. Opening cut, the<br />thumping \\"Candy shop\\" (with stabbing synths and Eastern-sounding<br />string breaks) makes loads of innuendo laden references to sweets;<br />\\"Don't pretend you're not hungry/there's plenty to eat/I got Turkish<br />Delights\\" she purrs. \\"4 minutes\\" is the lead-off single and is a duet<br />with Justin Timberlake (he gets to say \\"Madonna, huh!\\" a lot), her<br />second duet single ever, after the rather dismal one she did with<br />Britney (\\"Me against the music\\"). It has a killer chorus, though I<br />find rather grating that riff that threatens to drown out the vocals<br />during the verses. It has already become her 37th US top 10 hit, and<br />60th UK top 10 hit.<br /><br />\\"Give it to me\\" is just ok, it doesn't move me, and to think this is<br />pencilled as the next single. Hopefully, the remixes will be much<br />better. \\"Spanish lesson\\" is an attempt at flamenco pop, think Timberlake's<br />\\"Like I love you\\" (which like this was produced by Pharrell) or N*E*R*D's<br />\\"She wants to move\\". The Flamenco-style music is nice, but the lyrics<br />are puerile and her voice sounds whiny.<br />Not quite another \\"La isla bonita\\", \\"Who's that girl\\" or \\"Spanish eyes\\", but still, it is silly fun.<br /><br />My favourite moments on the CD are when the Pop sheen bursts through<br />all that layering. \\"Heartbeat\\" (which starts off with the sound of a<br />heart beating) is catchy Europop with a Hip hop beat. The tender<br />\\"Miles away\\" (with a sparse sound, nice guitar strumming, electronic<br />flourishes and a disco beat closing it) features heartfelt pining<br />lyrics; \\"You always have the biggest heart when we're six thousand<br />miles apart\\" she sings. \\"Beat goes on\\" is an eighties style groovy<br />number (similar to her \\"Holiday\\") with a very laid back rap by Kanye<br />West, though it does seem to lose its groove in the final minute. I'm<br />sure I'm alone on this, but I prefer the leaked version I heard last<br />year. That was more stripped with fast strummed guitars, different<br />verses, and no Kanye. The fantastic \\"She's not me\\" is very reminiscent<br />of Chic, complete with scratchy guitar, though the final two minutes<br />or so seem to go nowhere for too long. \\"Dance 2night\\" is another<br />extremely catchy dark eighties style groovy number (I love the bridge<br />before the chorus).<br /><br />The frenetic piano sprinkled \\"Incredible\\" features syncopated beats,<br />(I love the swirling synths that come and go) but still has a ballad<br />feel, as does the beautiful quasi-symphonic \\"Devil wouldn't recognize<br />you\\" (with haunting choir-like harmonies) which reminds one ever so<br />faintly of co-writer Justin Timberlake's \\"What goes around\\" or even<br />\\"Cry me a river\\". Closing is the theatrical semi-ballad, \\"Voices\\" (the<br />opening vocals are so Queen-like) which sounds like some movie score<br />especially in its closing minute.<br /><br />A natural follow up to \\"Confessions on a dance floor\\" though better<br /> (in my opinion) and I find I can't stop playing it. Fun and incredibly groovy!
B000002UB6|5.0|After uncovering this CD in my large collection a few days ago and popping into my computer, I remembered again why I once worshiped this   album, and this great band in general. Although I don't listen to The Beatles as much as i used to, there music is still as fresh as it ever was.    Despite plenty of recongniton years after its release (Rolling Stone couldn't help but include this as one of the many Bratles albums to make the cut for 500 greatest albums) \\"Let it Be\\" seems to be the forgotten Beatles album. This is not suprsing considering it was released after the band broke up, and its entire existence only seems to remind fans of the Beatles great demise in those finaly two or three years.    For those who have seen the Beatles Documentaries, they know that this album was recorded for a documentary and that during the recording, things were quite tulmutous between the fab four. The Recording sessions took place in a hot stuffy room, and a lot of the stuff was recorded live. This is all greatly reflected on this album, as certain songs (Two of Us, Dig a Pony, Ive Got A Feeling, MAgge Mae) lack that squeeky clean sound that the majority of The Beatles' catalog contains. Still it is these songs that makes \\"Let it Be\\" the album that it is. For modern fans of The Beatles, looking to buy this album, they known that most of the other songs are classic singles already accesible on various Compilation albums. Not to put down songs like Get Back, The Long and Whinding Road, or the title track, but for the consumer who's looking to buy this product, be aware these are not the songs you should be looking to buy this album for.     All of the songs i've mentioned so far fall into the endless list of Beatle classics, in my opinion.\\"Dig a Pony\\" and \\"I'Ve GOt a Feeling\\" both have a unique gritty rock and roll sound that cant be found in any other BEatles Song. Harrison also provides two of his best and least well known tracks with \\"For YOu Blue\\" and \\"I me MIne\\". Then of course there are the hits, which are slightly different from the single versions many others are more more familiar with. FIrst of all, this album contains the far superior version of Across the Universe, as opposed to the B -side version available on PAst Masters 2. Also, i am partial to the slightly modified guitar solo in the album version of \\"Let it Be\\", featured here, which is also about 20 seconds longer then single version.  If i'm not mistaken, the \\"Get Back\\" version here is actually slightly shorter then the single, but it really doesn't make a difference.     LEt it Be is an essential to any Beatles collection, as it features some of their less known rock out tunes still with a WHite Album-esque attitude. Let it Be is simply another one of the many classics this amazing band put out.
B000UJ48UO|5.0|Along with \\"Platoon\\", \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" is one of the best anti-war films concerning Vietnam.  This Special edition which is the 2nd one to be released in HD & blu-ray is a big improvement over the first edition.  Also there are interviews with the cast members such R. Lee Ermey, Matthew Modine, Vincent D'Onofrio & Dorian Harewood. The image is sharp and there is very little grain at all. This belongs up there with Kubrick's own \\"Paths of Glory\\" as one of the great anti-war films of all time.  Perhaps George W. Bush should have seen this before making his fateful decision to send our troops in harms way!!
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|The title should have been a warning. Just like Erotica, this is one big dud! The cover is really tacky and horrible: a woman of her (mine!) age should know better and the music is really dismal. Do not get me wrong, her last record was really pretty good and even the live one after it was quite nice but this one is really staggeringly bad. OK so she is doing some duets with some very current people, but the whole thing is a mess really. Musically she has allways managed to follow the trends and to be above everybody else. Here there is a lack of melody that is the real killer. OK, I got it cheaply but I was expecting a lot more from her because she has shown herself to be quite talented and able to survive all the trends.
B000JLTR8G|4.0|This belongs in Robert Mitchum's filmography as one of the best films he did in his later years.  Granted he went back to the westerns that he did in his earlier years with little success, this genre-breaking off beat film noir reestablished his flagging film career for a long while longer. Along with \\"The Friends of Eddie Coyle\\", Big Mitch could still show us he had the vinegar to be a fine film actor. Definitely recommended for Mitchum fans and action buffs, Mitchum blends well with Japanese superstar, Ken Tarakura, who would later star in another noir film, \\"Black Rain\\".  But this is the better of the two thanks to sensitive direction by Sidney Pollack and a great script by the Schrader brothers.
B0010VD7EO|4.0|This is an excellent, fun album.  In the reviews I've read no one seems to mention the prog aspect of this album.  It took a while for my brain to find the connection to Daft Punk, but the connection is there nonetheless.  Dust of Discovery, play Face to Face, then listen to Electric Feel.  Il est très similaire n'est-ce pas?
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Hard Candy has finally arrived.  I have been waiting impatiently for this release.  I have to admit that this is one of Madonna's best albums.  For those of you who are worried that this album is too Timbaland/Pharrell/Timberlake, FEAR NOT! . . . This album is very much Madonna.  The songs are amazing and the overall feel of the album is amazing.  4 Minutes does not represent the album properly.  There are many other tracks that are much better than the first single.  Gems like Give It 2 Me & Incredible give a better insight into what Hard Candy sounds like.  Don't be quick to judge and take a listen.  You're in for a sweet surprise!!    Here's a track by track review:    Candy Shop:  This is pretty much the same version as the one that leaked months ago.  Im guessing Madonna        liked how it sounded so she didn't bother to change it.  Still it is fun to listen to.    \\"My Sugar is RAW\\"    4 Minutes:  You all know this one.    Give It 2 Me:  Definitely one of the best tracks.  It has a modern pop sound with some 80s influence.  Very fun & energetic.    \\"Get Stupid, Don't Stop It\\"    Heartbeat:  Love the electro-sound of this track.  More of  a mid-tempo song but still good enough to dance to.    \\"See My Booty Get Down\\"    Miles Away:  Very Sweet.  Obviously for her hubby Guy.  This song features some acoustic guitars as well as some dance flavor towards the end.    \\"You always have the biggest heart when we're 6,000 miles apart\\"    She's Not Me:  This song reminds me of Sorry.  M letting the guy know that no one compares to her.  Good sound and great lyrics.    \\"She doesn't have what's ours\\"    Incredible:  Hands down the best song on the album.  Love how the momentum builds up as the song progresses.  Just an amazing dance song.  \\"Sex with you is . . . Incredible\\"    Beat Goes On:  Looks like Madonna took her advice from the demo and tried something new.  Although I liked the demo it felt like it was missing something.  This version feels complete and Kanye's rapfits perfectly.  Has a nice pop/urban sound to it.  \\"Don't sit there like some silly girl\\"    Dance 2night:  This song is okay.  I was expecting this song to be upbeat like 4 minutes.  The lyrics are good though.  \\"You don't have to be beautiful to be understood\\"    Spanish Lesson: Very fun and upbeat.  It's great to hear M singing some Spanish again.   Although the translations aren't 100% correct it is still to hear some \\"lessons.\\"  This song really makes me want to get up and dance.  \\"Yo te quiero means I Love You\\"    Devil:  Im glad that this song was finally conceived.  Love the dark feel to it.  Many compare it to Cry Me A River but I think that it is way better than River.  Another great gem.  \\"Even the devil wouldn't recognize you BUT I do\\"    Voices: Another dark track.  Very haunting.  Good lyrics and emotional ending.  Very similar to the ending on Push.  \\"Who is the master & who is the slave?\\"    Ring My Bell: The pre-order track.  This song is decent.  Too bad it didn't make the final cut.    Remixes:  The remixes are decent.  I really like Junkie XL and the Oakenfold mix of Give it 2 me is amazing.    So here's the review.    Hope that you will enjoy the album like I am right now.  Don't be quick to judge and   listen to the album.  Forget the whole Timbaland & Co. and their attachment to the   album.  Madonna definitely takes the wheel and the producers take the back seat.  I   recommend this album to all fans, newbies, and anyone looking for a great workout   album.  Remember to \\"Work up a sweat cause that's what music's for.\\"
B0001HLVS2|5.0|An action movie thats really a drama. The director brings us on the ship, we're immmersed into their world. We're onboard. Director Weir wants us to know what it was like to be onboard a ship at war in 1810. See it. Hear it. Smell it. And most importantly, feel it.     And we come away thinking that this was not an easy life.     The mix of action and human drama is very entertaining. Thrilling battle scenes, yes, but the movie is not about this ship chasing that ship. Its about the relationships of the men. Because on a ship what did they have?, they had other people. The relationship most explored is the one between the captain and the doctor. They are friends, yes, but have different views on some things.      The acting is fantastic. Crowe is charismatic, and its fun to watch him shift from strong leader to jolly captain. This captain cares about his men and Crowe can show it with just a look in his eyes. Bettany and Pirkis are wonderful too.    The movie is also visually beautiful.     Theres something for everyone here because the movie tugs at your heart and your brain. Ship lovers will love it, so will British Navy buffs, so will naturalists. Everyone will. So come aboard.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|From the first song to the last, The Black Parade takes you on an unforgettable journey.  It brings up the common question, \\"what happens when we die?\\"  My Chemical Romance paint a vivid image of what they think happens.  In the first song, we are introduced to our protagonist, The Patient.  As his life ends, we are thrust into a fresh round of possibilities.  Do we all go to Hell?  Does Death come to us as our fondest memory?    The Black Parade is a masterpiece and is surely epic.

006135323X|1.0|Again, a fleeting glimpse into the obvious!         We all know that no economic model, let alone crude and simplistic models based on skimpy hypotheses, is a reliable measure or predictor of behavior.  This book's theses are rehashes of some economic notions that have already been fleshed out, rehashed, and exhausted in the simplest psych 101 readings.  This just shows that exaggerated credentials, slick packaging, a few skilfully placed \\"reviews\\", and make-it-easy short chapter slicing and dicing will always sell a few books these days.         Worse is the utter implausibility of the experiments - stuff that just didn't happen because people wouldn't do it (any more than soldiers in the Union Army sang The Battle Hymn of the Republic as they marched (\\"Be jubilant, my feet\\"????) or Soviet troops rushed to their deaths shouting,\\"For Stalin\\"!  Come on....         I can see the author and some of his colleagues from some Academia D-list giggling over cheap, pretentious red wine about pulling the wool over the eyes of their lumpen-readers for a few extra bucks.  Don't let those bucks be yours!
B0013FBS20|3.0|This version is a poorer film than the classic The Omega Man.  It is worth watching for the effects, which are brilliant, and Will Smith is always watchable, but it adds nothing in terms of telling the story to the original version.  And where it deviates, as it often does, the story is the poorer for it.    I'm also against the idea of including the alternating ending, which just seems like a cop out to me.  The makers of a movie should have the courage of their convictions and present the one version that is the story they want to tell.  By including two versions, both seem less \\"real\\" and neither seem particularly satisfying.

0756404746|4.0|There is so much to like about this new author that it might seem cruel to write mainly about this novels shortcomings.   It seems to verge on being the start of an intense new fantasy series, and the love of storytelling, woven into the plot itself, is evident.   But too often the author falls back into cliched situations and characters, such that at times it seems merely like a darker version of Harry Potter (and that is not meant as a compliment).  Pitifully few of the characters are given any great depth, and too many of the situations are overly contrived and illogical.  I will be buying the sequels, as I believe this author will improve on this promising first effort.  But if I could talk to him I'd ask him to have a clearer vision of his main characters and then ensure that they act more consistently with their personalities, strengths and weaknesses.  The 4 stars are three for this book, and one for showing promise.

B000VWYJ86|5.0|truly enjoyable movie, fight scenes much better choreographed than the first Bourne movie.  Lots of allusions to the first two so be sure that you see those first.  It's a shame that this is the last one, they keep getting better.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Now, I've seen a lot of reviews listed discussing how this album doesn't reflect the rough, anger-fueled music of the Linkin Park of the past, and after my first listen this is the same feeling I had.    But then I gave it another shot. And another. I gave it time to soak into my mind. I asked myself, \\"Why did Linkin Park decide to take this lighter sound?\\". Then I realized that they decided to take the approach of letting the lyrics speak for themselves instead of forcing the sound into the listener. Give this album some time, look past what it is missing from the older Linkin Park albums and see what it has gained. I have done this and I believe that \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" is as good as \\"Meteora\\".
0061245097|4.0|Cat is back and One Foot in the Grave is one of the best sequels I have read in a long time. Jeaniene Frost has written a new super-heroine that can play as dirty as the boys and won't take the injustices of life sitting down. The only other character I can compare her to in recent memory are Anita Blake from Laurel K. Hamilton or Eve Dallas from JD Robb.<br />One Foot in the Grave takes place four years into the future. Cat is no longer that naive, uncontrollable girl with a chip on her shoulder. Cat has grown into a sharp and intelligent woman who still kicks butt and comes up with the best comebacks and one-liners you can imagine. Cat is still a bit down on herself in terms of self-esteem and still thinks of herself as an outcast. She has become the head of an undercover group that works for the government. Even though she was basically blackmailed into taking this position, she has fought very hard to be in control and the \\"go to\\" person in almost every situation that arises.<br />Cat is half-human, half-vampire, and the department she works for is comparable to Homeland Security but for watching and experimenting on vampires. The powers that be want to know where vampires come from and how they can be stopped.In Halfway to the Grave, Cat hated her vampire side, now she is more comfortable in her skin and embraces it in a way. And the reason she does is due to her vampire lover she had to leave behind, Bones.<br />Cat has a hard time giving and receiving love, but when it came to Bones she was a goner. Cat has a lot of questions about her lost love. Has Bones wandered the world looking for her? Has he totally forgotten her and gone onto another lonely girl? Could Bones be dead? All these questions will be answered in ways you will not believe! I guess you can say it is not much of a spoiler since Cat and Bones are the ultimate couple, so you can expect to see him make an appearance. And with his appearance, Cat is yet again launched in uncharted waters. Bones may come across as a witty playboy type of guy, but he has great insight on a person.<br />One Foot in the Grave has quite a few twists and gasps that I did not see coming. Every thing comes out with a bang and you will meet some over the top characters that will make you laugh till your stomach hurts.And, the other thing Jeaniene can do very well is write a good quality love scene.<br />One Foot in the Grave is an excellent, paranormal urban fantasy that did not disappoint in the least. Jeaniene tightened up certain problems I had with Halfway to the Grave and wrote a story that is fast and furious.<br />One not to be missed!<br /><br />Katiebabs<br />[[ASIN:0061245089 Halfway to the Grave (Night Huntress, Book 1)]]oss as a witty playboy type of guy, but he has great insight on a person.

B000FVE3BG|5.0|I have 10 watches and this is one of my favorites.  It is a big watch but not too big.  The blue dial and gold edged white numbers are eye catching.  It is not a heavy watch and although I am not left handed I love wearing this watch.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|WOW..My detest is going to be happy to see me after this one. This CD is all sugar and sweet. I'm loving it. Just when you think she can not out due herself, she does it.

B0012E6R3W|5.0|I can honestly say that I lost interest in Testament, and thrash in general for that matter, in the early 90s as the scene splintered off into a million directions as a result of the death metal takeover and grunge revolution. I've always considered Souls of Black to be the last REAL Testament record. Yes, I know. The stuff they've released since then has probably all been great. But I just had no desire to check any of it out. Testament was just not Testament without Alex, in my opinion, and The Ritual was just a bit too \\"hard rockish\\" for my tastes.     Well, that changes today with this release. The classic lineup is back with an excellent album that seems to be tailor-made for those of us who will always have that classic thrash sound in our hearts no matter how old we get. This album totally takes me back to a time when metal was exciting. The riffs are crushing. The vocals are right on. The solos are phenominal. Just all around awesome. It sounds...no kidding...like a remastered The New Order. I'm totally floored that they were able to recreate that magic so many years later. Just awesome.    I'm super excited to see many of the classic old school thrash bands return to their purest form. Now if only Metallica would wisen up and give us another Puppets...
B000005DQR|5.0|When Endtroducing came out, there was little if anything like it anywhere. It's hard to recapture that same feeling more than 10 years after the fact, but in my mind, this remains one of the top 50 innovative albums in music. Simply incredible turntablism.
B00005176F|5.0|The CD was exactly what I wanted and was delivered exactly as promised. I'd do business with them again anytime.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|This has the flavor of classic funk (specifically the later years of Motown) but with a new twist. It invoked in me the same sensation as when Jamiroquai first came out. There's something wonderfully and comfortingly familiar while having plenty of newness so it doesn't come across as too-safe retro tripe.
B000ZN8036|1.0|I know, I know.  Everyone loves Into the Wild, but I just don't think they understand it very well.  I do understand it, however, and it's not a good film at all.    I've taken a film course, so I know a thing or two about what a good movie has to have in it in order to entertain the audience (be it comedy, musical numbers, animals, or violence).  This movie has none of that but instead follows this scruffy teenager around as he explores the meaning of life by burning up money and engraving things.  I will give Into the Wild credit for being the best movie ever about engraving things into a belt, but it doesn't have too much competition frankly!    Emile Hirsch and Sean Penn are great in this movie, but there's nothing that really grabs you as an audience member.  Why doesn't Emile's character Christopher/Alexander ever fall in love?  That would really hit one out of the ballpark for me, Joe Viewer, because I would be like very interested in how he and his girlfriend were going to survive.  But I don't want to see a movie about some dude talking to himself for 2 1/2 hours!  At least if they made just one of the animals talk back to him (like Disney does so well), then it would have made much more sense.    All in all, I think this movie is beautiful to look at, like Christie Brinkley, but doesn't have that much substance because there's no dramatic tension or life revelations other than 2 1/2 hours is a long time to be sitting down.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I don't have anything to add to everyone else's rave reviews but my review is here simply because it deserves my 5 stars. Fantastic soundtrack.

B00025ETIW|4.0|MCR keeps getting better with each album. I think little of their first release. This (their 2nd) is much better but not as good as the third (3rd=The Black Parade - which is the most recent at the time of this review).    This album is good, it shows promise, and it has a few real gems. However there are too many disposable and/or forgettable tracks for me to give it 5 stars.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|After hearing the first two lackluster tracks (4 Minutes and Beat Goes On), I was expecting another uninspired American Life-type bomb. BUT, as the Madonna gods would have it, those two songs are the weakest of the bunch. And brilliant numbers such as Heartbeat, She's Not Me and Incredible showcase how Madge has her fingers placed ohso perfectly on the pulse of pop music and the mainstream - and how she alone knows how to combine the best-of-music today into the \\"next best thing\\" for tomorrow, which is what Hard Candy is.
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|First of all, I love theme albums. To me, an album should feel like a whole entity, not a shuffle of stuff that happen to be from the same artist. Theme albums aren't the only way to pull this off, but they are a great way to do so.    The Black Parade is the campy pop sensibilities of Queen, the dark epic story telling of Pink Floyd (a la The Wall), the drums of Smashing Pumpkins, the bass and rhythm guitar of Green Day, and the lead guitar of Guns n Roses. These are all things that I admire deeply. So why the uneasy feeling when I listen to this album? I think it's because it's too close to all of those things. If you told me that this was a super-band made up of members of those groups, I'd believe you. The similarities to The Wall are especially over the top. I love The Wall and was at first really excited to see the influences of it on The Black Parade. But as the album went on, the similarities became just too numerous. I can tell MCR is extremely creative but there was too little that was uniquely MCR among the homages.    This rant aside, I do still really enjoy The Black Parade. I don't purchase many CDs anymore but I'm very glad I got this one.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I have been a Madonna fan since the beginning & I have to say, I like this album a lot. Confessions was fantastic & one of my favorite M Cd's. From the Prince feel of \\"Candy Shop\\" to the melodic \\"Voices\\" and \\"Miles Away\\"; I am digging the album. \\"4 Minutes\\" is a good pop/hiphop trance which served it's purpose ( getting M back on the radio). Give It 2 Me is a cool disco pop song. Two of my favorites are Heartbeat & Beat goes On. Both have the feel of her first album/singles from the 80's, but still have a current vibe(I could have done without the Kayne rap, but it serves its purpose). \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" has been around for a few years and was reworked for this album. It's a good song as well, although I'd love to hear the Mirwais version. This is a good straight up pop and dancee album. A good summer fling with Madonna that brings her contract with Warner Bros to full circle.
B00133KHCY|4.0|I really enjoyed this film, though it is a little off of regular film fare.  Maybe \\"unusual\\" is a better term. Actors all do a great job.  Definitely recommended !
0316010669|3.0|Snap judgments are arrived at by a ruthless pruning of information, which our brains process without our being aware of it. A good snap judgment occurs when the information which has been discarded is irrelevant to the matter in hand; a bad one when it is not. An overload of information leads to a paralysis of judgment, which is why information-gathering bureaucracies are often not merely inefficient but grotesquely error-prone.  Gladwell's book, which starts well enough, meanders and begins to go off the point about halfway through. This is probably because the subject cannot sustain a full-length study without digression. His style is conversational and easy to read but (for me at least) too colloquial.
0525950079|3.0|There are much wittier criticisms on this novel already, but I'd like to voice my disappoints as well. The followup novel to Pillars of the Earth lacks much original thought - it feels like formula writing and the ending is pretty poor. The antagonists are killed off, shipped out or dismembered out of convenience and the story ultimately makes you wonder if you've been wasting your time with this epic nonsense.
630460288X|3.0|In the future, everyone lives in harmony; no one smokes, swears or dies of unnatural causes; and popular radio stations play advertising jingles from the 20th century.

The peace loving futurites can't cope with the situation, so resort to defrosting John Spartan (Sylvester Stallone), the man who originally captured Phoenix but who was also arrested for killing over 30 civilians in the process.    \\"Demolition Man\\" is an enjoyable film that had the potential to be better. With Daniel Waters (who also wrote \\"Heathers\\" and \\"Batman Returns\\") as one of the script writers, the script does have moments of his trademark black humour, but not enough to hide the fact that this is a typical, big-budget studio action film. The cast of the film is incredible and includes, among others, Stallone, Snipes, Sandra Bullock, Benjamin Bratt, Nigel Hawthorne, Rob Schneider and Denis Leary, but many of these actors are criminally underused (especially Leary, as the rebel leader, who only appears for about 10 minutes in total). Nevertheless, the vision of a future so perfect that fun has basically been outlawed is interesting and Snipes is in the role of his career, hamming it up as the villain.
B0016HNOXQ|4.0|Lets be honest, this album isn't going to change the world.  I became a Portishead fan just as their second album was released, so it's so nice for them to be back...but after a decade, many would be happy with ANYTHING, no matter how bad.    Fortunately, this is a pretty decent album.  Hunter, Nylon Smile, The Rip, Small, and especially Threads (I consider it the best on the album) are all good tracks.  The others don't stand out as much, my finger itches to the > button when they come on.  Deep Water is garbage (sorry).    If you are a Portishead fan, or even like them a little, you should buy this.  If you are not yet a Portishead fan, buy the first two albums (Dummy and Portishead) and THEN purchase this if you like those two (just as you should watch Episode 4, 5, and 6 BEFORE the others).    Glad they are back, and let's hope that we don't need to wait another 10 years to hear them again!
B000KX0HVY|5.0|This 2 disc CD is wonderful! We have listened to it several times and it never gets old.  The song selection is wide range and covers everything from sentimental to romance to rock! I would recommend this to everyone!!
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|Before, Madonna made producers; now she is going along with the bandwagon and letting producers make her. The result: unique and modern pop perfection. With production done by The Neptunes, Timbaland, Justin Timberlake, and Pharrell, Hard Candy is Madonna's most mainstream album to date.    (1) The album starts out just like the album cover--sour. \\"Candy Shop\\" is easily the worst song on Hard Candy, and possibly the worst of Madge's career with lyrics eerily similar to 50 Cent's \\"Candy Shop.\\"  (2) But there is no need to worry Madonna's Hard Candy picks up right away (maybe \\"Candy Shop\\" was just a tease for the rest of the album) with her addictive first single \\"4 Minutes\\" which features marching band horns and sharp bass. Justin Timberlake and Madonna hit a homerun with this monster single.  (3) The album continues with Madonna's second official single \\"Give It 2 Me,\\" an upbeat, dance anthem where Madonna excels blending hip-hop and pop.  (5) Two more tracks later is the simplistic, perfectly designed \\"Miles Away,\\" and aside from the first verse (\\"I just woke up from a fuzzy dream.\\"), it is one of the best songs on Hard Candy--and one of the best of Madge's career. Everything about \\"Miles Away\\" is pop perfection: the addictive chorus, the simplistic background guitar yet heavy bass, the enticing hook, and the beautifully crafted bridge in the middle; the song is timeless.  (6) Yet one song later, we have the opposite. Although Madonna's voice sounds great, \\"She's Not Me\\" lacks exactly what \\"Miles Away\\" has. It has an out-of-place hook, distorted bass, and a mediocre chorus.   (8) \\"Beat Goes On\\" showcases Pharrell's perfection in production--mixing a striking, up-beat sensation featuring a solo by Kanye West. Madonna lays it down on this one. Who would have thought Madonna could have pulled a song like this off? Not that I ever doubted Madonna, but this song was a surprise to hear.  (10) By now one might expect to find a song like \\"Spanish Lesson\\" where Madonna blurts out random Spanish verses, but mixing it with hip-hop never really works.  (11) \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" is a song where, besides the distorted bass, just works. Something about Timbaland beats mixed with Madonna's tantalizing voice creates a seductive, slow hip-hop/pop sensation. It is a recognizable smash hit.  (12) It ends, on a great note with the addictive \\"Voices\\" where Madonna proves she can just about anything even hip-hop.  (Bonus Track) But if you grab the bonus track, the album doesn't end with \\"Voices,\\" instead ends with an out-of-place, borderline annoying (no one should sing the chorus over and over again, not even Madonna) song \\"Ring My Bell.\\" It proves exactly why it is a bonus track and did not end up making the final album.    Overall, Hard Candy is a surprisingly appealing hip-hop/pop sensation. Even though it might not be the most original Madonna album in a while, it is undoubtedly one that she shines on--Madonna proves once again that she is the queen of pop.    Download: Give It 2 Me, Miles Away, Beat Goes On, Devil Wouldn't Recognize You, Heartbeat
B00005RHGL|5.0|Tombstone is a favorite movie of many of my family members ranging from my 9 year old daughter to my husband to my father and brother!!  We all love it and it never grows old or boring.  Val Kilmer absolutely makes the movie with his wonderful rendition of Doc Holliday.  We could watch this movie every day.  The extended cut has scenes that you do not see on regular television and makes it very worthwhile to buy this one.
B001437DMA|4.0|Disclaimer: I have listened to Joe since \\"surfing\\", have almost all his works, and have seen him live. I am a fan.<br /><br />One has to admit, Joe has made a good living and effort making a certian kind of album. Some might say he makes the same album each time. However, he is doing three things: One, pleasing his fan base. Two, experimenting with new sounds and textures. Three, keeping true to his roots.<br /><br />In \\"Professor Satchafunkilus\\" one can find \\"old favorites\\" in the styles of some songs. You can find unique new sound experiments, and songs that just flat out rock.<br /><br />A true fan will understand this. I am sure others will pick it apart because of the \\"new\\" sounds or different perspectives it takes on in his exploration of different syles of music. It is a good solid effort that I am happy to buy.
B00169XU8I|5.0|In a career that spans the course of 3 decades, countless number one singles, 6 world tours, over 2 dozen motion pictures, more than 60 music videos, 21 full-length records, dozens of books, 3 long-running stage productions, multiple lovers, 2 marriages, millions and millions of fans from as far as the eye can see, tens of thousands of magazine covers, and more than half a ton of bleach, not to mention truckloads of conical braziers, gold teeth, rosaries, lacy bustiers, crucifixes, bolero jackets, oversized hoop-earnings, navy blue berets, cowboy hats, henna tattoo, limited edition Louis Vuitton Murakami bags, custom-made Hermès wrap-around sunglasses and in her newest incarnation ~ Black Chanel Boxing Gloves...Is it any wonder that the Maven who invented the word WANNABE, who is everyone's favorite High-Holy Priestess of Re-Invention...is The Most Celebrated Person on the Globe...?     Warner Music has faithfully released limited edition CDs since \\"Ray of Light\\" (prior to that, they only did it intermittently in certain countries or only on a promotional basis,) and this one for HARD CANDY is the very best! I'm crazy about this because it is so unique and well put together and it actually includes extra pictures and that cool little candy box! Also, the new limited edition CD is finally priced at sell-through prices (in the past they would always be at least forty of fifty) and it's finally offered up quickly at the same time as the regular CD is offered! ...This also includes 2 remixes of \\"4 Minutes!!\\" And there's a very beautiful booklet with over 30 pages!! This is exactly what fans want! Get this and keep it sealed!    ...Queen Madonna never does anything that is less than flawless, nor does she ever do anything that is less than a complete and total ostentatious exhibition. HARD CANDY is certainly no exception to the rule because it's a spectacle! Like a really huge bulging...jawbreaker, Madonna's newest CD is a sugary mouthful that's always hard and ready and still very delicate and soft to the touch! At first, it may appear tart, but the more you play with it, the sweeter it tastes! All you need are a few Altoids and maybe a Malrboro for afterwards. ...On this CD Madonna gets down like never before, as she sings about what she loves, loathes and lusts.      What's wrong with not leaving anything to the imagination? As far as I'm concerned: Absolutely Nothing. With her huge oblong-shaped golden championship belt and her legs spread apart and her mouth partially open, this innocent bystander fantasizes that this pulchritudinous purrer would jump out and spring to life. The New Madonna (my goodness, if I got a buck every time someone referred to Madonna as \\"the new Madonna\\" I'd be a very rich person) is almost uncontrolled and maybe even vulgar in her initial appearance; but the more I gaze at the pictures inside \\"Hard Candy,\\" the more I see my muse. This is such a youthful and energetic Madonna who's just beginning to explode and boil over with severe sensuality. ...You know, there's an ugly rumor going around about Madonna (we all know that the poor thing has been called everything in the book and has been accused of sleeping with every warm body on the planet,) this time they're claiming she's 49. Can that really be true? It can't be, because she doesn't look a day over 29.    On this 12-track studio-album, her final studio CD from Warner Music (note to self: there will be a greatest hits CD out at the end of the year!), Madonna includes her worldwide hit, [[ASIN:B00171NTU4 4 Minutes]]! 4 MINUTES is Madonna's singing-anthem with her new BFF, Justin Timberlake; they both sing about how they'd like to save us all. And if that's not enough, last moth, Madonna made headlines around the world when she proclaimed that she wanted to \\"save Britney!\\" It's not easy, but if anyone can do it I'm sure it's Madonna. \\"4 Minutes\\" is a quick track that is very easy to listen to (it's no wonder Z-100 plays her lead-single every hour and every day!) The single has already reached number one in more than a dozen countries around the world, it's just a matter of time for it to top the Billboard Charts in the US. Everyone, please stand by while Madonna takes off, straight to the top of the pops.     Madonna opens the CD singing: I'll be your one stop (one stop) Candy Shop... This song reminds me of an intricate illusion because it is so magical. Actually, Madonna's entire CD is talismanic because as usual she is courageously treading new waters for the very first time; without blinking once! Some of the other stand-alone tracks on this CD are: \\"Miles Away,\\" \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" and \\"Give It 2 Me.\\" Just like all the other songs on this CD, these are the types of tracks you would expect to hear at your favorite club, on MTV or even coming out of someone's hooked-up fire-engine red Mustang as they come rolling by. Because these songs totally have such a universal message that draws you and I in, while appealing to everyone else in between.     1) CANDY SHOP - 4:15 (produced by: Madonna & Pharrell Williams)    This song reminds me of Madonna's hugely successful single \\"Hung Up.\\" But in \\"Candy Shop\\" Madonna uses the sounds of synths and electronic equipment, her lyrics are both strong and funny. As usual Madonna is often using innuendo as she sings \\"Don't pretend you're not hungry, there's plenty to eat...\\"    2) 4 MINUTES - 4:04 (produced by: Madonna, Timothy Mosley, Nate Hills & Justin Timberlake)   (featuring Justin Timberlake)  This is one of my very favorite songs on the CD for all the same reasons why the entire world loves it. 4 Minutes is fast and beautiful and breathtaking. Madonna's theme de jour on this track is love and s-e-x! This song totally sounds futuristic; I wouldn't be surprised if my grandbabies listened to this song.    3) GIVE IT 2 ME - 4:47 (produced by: Madonna & Williams)    Warner Music and Madonna are very interested in using this song as the 2nd single for \\"Hard Candy,\\" because it helps bridge the gap between Madonna's older sound and newer sound. On this track, Madonna's pure bubblegum pop as she sings \\"if you can handle it, undress me...\\"     4) HEARTBEAT - 4:03 (produced by: Madonna & Williams)    This is such a fantastic studio album track because it has the potential to be a number 1 single. It has such a catchy hook but it's not one that will knock you out too soon.    5) MILES AWAY -  4:48 (produced by: Madonna, Mosley, Hills & Timberlake)   It's ethereal, mid tempo and guitar-heavy. It has that fabulous hand clapping bit during the middle which reminds everyone that Madonna's an original who sets her own rules.    6) SHE'S NOT ME - 6:04 (produced by: Madonna & Williams)    OMG so much like \\"Thief of Hearts.\\" Madonna sings about someone who's obsessed with her and who dresses like her, but there can only be one Madonna!    7) INCREDIBLE - 6:19 (produced by: Madonna & Williams)    A ravishing slow ballad which reminds me of what Madonna said in her \\"Something to Remember\\" CD, \\"it's about the music & it's always been about the music.\\"     8) BEAT GOES ON - 4:26 (produced by: Madonna, Kanye West & Williams )  (featuring Kanye)    This song has come a long way since it was first leaked to the net, last summer. Fans will appreciate the album track much more because it's totally reminiscent of New York's underground disco life of the 70's and early 80's that Madonna was so much a part of. Kanye is such a superior singer, producer, entertainer who both compliments and adds to something already perfect!     9) DANCE 2NITE - 5:03 (produced by: Madonna, Mosley, Hannon Lane & Timberlake)    Madonna has totally retrogressed to her \\"you can dance\\" days with this record because it's totally hedonistic and pleasurable and danceable. Although it does have somewhat of a dark feel to it.    10) SPANISH LESSON - 3:37 (produced by: Madonna, Williams)    Madonna opens the song with, \\"Yo te quiero means I love you.\\" This is a fast-moving Spanish/English track. As Madonna's fans know already know, she has a passion and a talent for singing in Spanish.     11) DEVIL WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU -  5:09 (produced by: Madonna, Joe Henry, Mosley, Hills & Timberlake)   Madonna purrs \\"Over and over you're pushing me onto the floor and I keep coming back for more\\" in her sexy sweet-sounding melody that is all too familiar by now. This song isn't exactly a ballad but it does have a somewhat somber tone, as it opens.    12) VOICES - 3:39 (produced by: Madonna, Mosley, Hills, Lane, Timberlake)    This is perhaps Madonna's most out-there track. She saved the most unique and personal song for the end, with lyrics like \\"Are you walking the dog or is that dog walking you.    13) 4 Minutes ~ Tracy Young House Mix Edit     14) 4 Minutes ~ Rebirth Anthem Mix Edit     On this 12-track studio-album, her final studio CD from Warner Music (note to self: there will be a greatest hits CD out at the end of the year!), Madonna includes her worldwide hit, [[ASIN:B00171NTU4 4 Minutes]]! 4 MINUTES is Madonna's singing-anthem with her new BFF, Justin Timberlake; they both sing about how they'd like to save us all. And if that's not enough, last moth, Madonna made headlines around the world when she proclaimed that she wanted to \\"save Britney!\\" It's not easy, but if anyone can do it I'm sure it's Madonna. \\"4 Minutes\\" is a quick track that is very easy to listen to (it's no wonder Z-100 plays her lead-single every hour and every day!) The single has already reached number one in more than a dozen countries around the world, it's just a matter of time for it to top the Billboard Charts in the US. Everyone, please stand by while Madonna takes off, straight to the top of the pops.     Madonna opens the CD singing: I'll be your one stop (one stop) Candy Shop... This song reminds me of an intricate illusion because it is so magical. Actually, Madonna's entire CD is talismanic because as usual she is courageously treading new waters for the veryfirst time; without blinking once! Some of the other stand-alone tracks on this CD are: \\"Miles Away,\\" \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" and \\"Give It 2 Me.\\" Just like all the other songs on this CD, these are the types of tracks you would expect to hear at your favorite club, on MTV or even coming out of someone's hooked-up fire-engine red Mustang as they come rolling by. Because these songs totally have such a universal message that draws you and I in, while appealing to everyone else in between. These songs all fit together precisely and have such an urban-retro sound that's almost coercive; this reviewer wouldn't be surprised if Madonna took up cage fighting in her next video. Even though Madonna worked with a slew of optimal producers, \\"Hard Candy\\" still has a very raw feeling that is almost reminiscent of [[ASIN:B000002MFN Erotica]], because there's such a dark sonance to it. But like [[ASIN:B000002NJS Ray of Light]] this CD does offer some hope of a new beginning as well, because of its sleek sound that's polished, edgy and very fast-moving. Of course if you go to your local record store (do they still call 'em record stores?) you'd find this CD in the pop section because that's just what Madonna's been for all these years; popular. However, on \\"Hard Candy\\" she mixes just a touch of disco, R&B, hip hop, hard rock and maybe even a dash of Catholic Guilt for good measure!      Madonna would never stop until she amassed a complete and total masterpiece. Compared to her last CD, 05's blockbuster [[ASIN:B000B8QEZG Confessions on a Dance Floor]], Madonna really had an abundance more to get off of her music-loving chest on \\"Hard Candy.\\" This is a dance record, but more than that, it's an inner-reflection to the catalyst's heart. When asked about the differences between these 2 CD's recently, Madonna said: On \\"Confessions,\\" which I wrote all the lyrics to, I wanted to stay away from anything serious... and with this one I wanted to dig deeper and go to a different place.For me, it's a true collaboration, intellectually and artistically.      Here she comes, are you ready for her? To Kick off \\"Hard Candy\\" Madonna will be performing some of her latest, greatest hits at Roseland, tomorrow, for a special invitation-only concert; for only her luckiest fans. The Roseland concert will be streamed on MSN, and she'll also be performing at 2 other special events in London and Paris. If you miss her don't worry though because Madonna plans to kick off her Hard Candy World Tour at London's Wembley Stadium next September. Hello...Gorgeous. Ester is Back...! ..Music stores like the Virgin Megastore in NY, London and LA are giving away free gifts to celebrate the release of \\"Hard Candy.\\" And, there's a ton of stuff for \\"4 Minutes\\" as it was simultaneously released around the world, at the same time as HARD CANDY! There are about a trillion different CDs, records and lots of other promotional items in commemoration of \\"Hard Candy.\\" Here are just some of the merch you could expect to see from everyone's favorite Goddess of S-E-X:    \\"Hard Candy\\" Limited Edition \\"Candy Box\\" CDs overseas: In addition, there will be a limited edition for Japan, the UK and Australia. But (with the exception of the Japanese lyrics/characters) these CDs will be no different from the US limited edition release and these will likely not be available on Amazon (however, you can find them on eBay or through esprit.)      \\"Hard Candy\\" Commercial CDs from Asia: There is an awesome CD from Taiwan which includes a Taiwanese lyric booklet and a pull-out picture that some sellers are calling a \\"poster.\\" There's a very rare CD from China which is pressed in very limited quantities. And there's a Singaporean CD which is also very similar to the US release. In addition, there is also a [[ASIN:B00151W394 Japanese CD]] which includes the lyrics to the songs (in English & Japanese) which Amazon is offering. The Japanese CD also includes the bonus track \\"Ring My Bell.\\" Although, none ofthese other CDs will be offered on Amazon, but you can find them on eBay.      \\"Hard Candy\\" Commercial CDs from Europe, Australia & South America: These aren't very special and are nearly exactly the same as the US CD. Amazon will not be offering any of these CDs, except for 1 which is pressed by [[ASIN:B0017PCLTA WEA ]]; only die-hard collectors would get this, though.      [[ASIN:B0016OOM7Q Hard Candy 3-LP Vinyl w/ CD]]: This includes the full-length album on 3 special edition vinyls, 2 of the LPs are \\"candy colored,\\" and this also includes the full CD, as well!      \\"Hard Candy\\" Cassette Album: This is again something for only die-hard collectors. The US & the UK stopped manufacturing cassettes at least 5-6 years ago. However, this album is available on cassette in Malaysia and Thailand. These will not be sold on Amazon, but you may be able to find them on eBay.      [[ASIN:B0018CAANG Hard Candy downloads & bonus tracks ]]: This includes bonus remixes for \\"4 Minutes\\" as well as the tracks \\"Ring My Bell\\" (through iTunes) & \\"Give it to Me.\\"      Promotional-Only LPs, CDs & other items: There is a US & UK promo LP. In addition, I am told that there is a very rare promo LP w/ gatefold from Japan. And there's a promo CD from the US, as well as a lot of other items such as acetates and promotional CDs for \\"4 Minutes.\\" There will also be a picture disc released for at least one of the singles and WEA may also put the full long play on p/d as well. You may be able to find some of these items on eBay, or a better place is through esprit.     ...You will experience merriment of emotions which run the gamut of abhorrence to delectation as you listen to this record, \\"Hard Candy.\\" This is the reason why Madonna is not just an artist, but the Defining Pioneer. With her freshest work of art, this modern-day iconoclast is asking the question, giving the answer and simultaneously luring the listener into her den of pleasure, all at once...!

Over time, Madonna has proved that she is the most ambitious and the busiest bee in the universe. Not only is Madonna the only pop star from the 80's who is still around, but she is also still making innovative music. That's what makes her so astonishing. While all of her former contemporaries are busy either in rehab or making horrible infomercials, Madonna can claim her rein as the Queen of Pop. If you're a new fan or a longtime fan trying to complete your collection,   here's a list of all of Madonna's full CDs:  * Madonna (July 27, 1983) (studio album)    * Like a Virgin (November 12, 1984) (studio album)   * True Blue (June 30, 1986) (studio album)    * Who's That Girl (July 21, 1987) (soundtrack)  * You Can Dance (November 17, 1987) (remix long play)  * Like a Prayer (March 21, 1989) (studio album)  * I'm Breathless (May 22, 1990) (film inspired)   * The Immaculate Collection (November 13, 1990) (greatest hits)  * Erotica (October 20, 1992) (studio album)  * Bedtime Stories (October 25, 1994) (studio album)  * Something To Remember (November 7, 1995) (compilation)   * EVITA (October 25, 1996) (soundtrack)  * Ray of Light (March 2, 1998) (studio album)  * Music (September 18, 2000) (studio album)  * GHV2 (November 13, 2001) (greatest hits)  * American Life (April 22, 2003) (studio album)  * Remixed & Revisited (November 24, 2003) (remix extended play)  * Confessions on a Dance Floor (November 15, 2005) (studio album)  * I'm Going to tell You a Secret (June 20, 2006) (soundtrack)  * The Confessions Tour (January 30, 2007) (live long play)   * Hard Candy (April 29, 2008) (studio album)     You will experience merriment of emotions which run the gamut of abhorrence to delectation as you listen to this record, \\"Hard Candy.\\" This is the reason why Madonna is not just an artist, but the Defining Pioneer. With her freshest work of art, this modern-day iconoclast is asking the question, giving the answer and simultaneously luring the listener into her den of pleasure, all at once...!
B000ZN802W|5.0|t has been a while since I have watched a movie that evoked such powerful emotion. There is much controversy about this young man's life - ranging in the extremes - admiration or pity. That's what great movies and art usually do, they don't leave you with clear cut answers, but leave you with more questions and leave you thinking about the deeper things of life. Life in general as well as our own personal lives. I am really intrigued by this young man's life, and am now set on reading the book. The movie was beautiful to watch - the scenery across the U.S., as well as the pure, unpretentious Emile Hirsch. (*Spoiler) At the end of the movie, I was left devastated - mourning for a life that ended so quickly, and so alone. A tragic ending as he realized in solitude that \\"happiness is real when shared\\". Many might say that he was too reckless and stupid - not enough preparation and planning - that some even go as far to say he got what he deserved. Yet those that judge him so, do not know how much life he lived in those last few months in freedom. You might live a whole life, being safe, secure, in a planned, structured, comfortable life. The few months he lived in the wild, may have meant just as much as or even more, than a lifetime lived in fear and complacency.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|In a career that spans the course of 3 decades, countless number one singles, 6 world tours, over 2 dozen motion pictures, more than 60 music videos, 21 full-length records, dozens of books, 3 long-running stage productions, multiple lovers, 2 marriages, millions and millions of fans from as far as the eye can see, tens of thousands of magazine covers, and more than half a ton of bleach, not to mention truckloads of conical braziers, gold teeth, rosaries, lacy bustiers, crucifixes, bolero jackets, oversized hoop-earnings, navy blue berets, cowboy hats, henna tattoo, Louis Vuitton Murakami bags, custom-made Hermès wrap-around sunglasses and in her newest incarnation ~ Black Chanel Boxing Gloves...Is it any wonder that the Maven who invented the word WANNABE, who is everyone's favorite High-Holy Priestess of Re-Invention...is The Most Celebrated Person on the Globe...?      Queen Madonna never does anything that is less than flawless, nor does she ever do anything that is less than a complete and total ostentatious exhibition. HARD CANDY is certainly no exception to the rule because it's a spectacle! Like a really huge bulging...jawbreaker, Madonna's newest CD is a sugary mouthful that's always hard and ready and still very delicate and soft to the touch! At first, it may appear tart, but the more you play with it, the sweeter it tastes! All you need are a few Altoids and maybe a Malrboro for afterwards. ...On this CD Madonna gets down like never before, as she sings about what she loves, loathes and lusts.    What's wrong with not leaving anything to the imagination? As far as I'm concerned: Absolutely Nothing. With her huge oblong-shaped golden championship belt and her legs spread apart and her mouth partially open, this innocent bystander fantasizes that this pulchritudinous purrer would jump out and spring to life. The New Madonna (my goodness, if I got a buck every time someone referred to Madonna as \\"the new Madonna\\" I'd be a very rich person) is almost uncontrolled and maybe even vulgar in her initial appearance; but the more I gaze at the pictures inside \\"Hard Candy,\\" the more I see my muse. This is such a youthful and energetic Madonna who's just beginning to explode and boil over with severe sensuality. ...You know, there's an ugly rumor going around about Madonna (we all know that the poor thing has been called everything in the book and has been accused of sleeping with every warm body on the planet,) this time they're claiming she's 49. Can that really be true? It can't be, because she doesn't look a day over 29.     On this 12-track studio-album, her final studio CD from Warner Music (note to self: there will be a greatest hits CD out at the end of the year!), Madonna includes her worldwide hit, [[ASIN:B00171NTU4 4 Minutes]]! 4 MINUTES is Madonna's singing-anthem with her new BFF, Justin Timberlake; they both sing about how they'd like to save us all. And if that's not enough, last moth, Madonna made headlines around the world when she proclaimed that she wanted to \\"save Britney!\\" It's not easy, but if anyone can do it I'm sure it's Madonna. \\"4 Minutes\\" is a quick track that is very easy to listen to (it's no wonder Z-100 plays her lead-single every hour and every day!) The single has already reached number one in more than a dozen countries around the world, it's just a matter of time for it to top the Billboard Charts in the US. Everyone, please stand by while Madonna takes off, straight to the top of the pops.      Madonna opens the CD singing: I'll be your one stop (one stop) Candy Shop... This song reminds me of an intricate illusion because it is so magical. Actually, Madonna's entire CD is talismanic because as usual she is courageously treading new waters for the very first time; without blinking once! Some of the other stand-alone tracks on this CD are: \\"Miles Away,\\" \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" and \\"Give It 2 Me.\\" Just like all the other songs on this CD, these are the types of tracks you would expectto hear at your favorite club, on MTV or even coming out of someone's hooked-up fire-engine red Mustang as they come rolling by. Because these songs totally have such a universal message that draws you and I in, while appealing to everyone else in between.     HARD CANDY TRACKS   1) CANDY SHOP - 4:15 (produced by: Madonna & Pharrell Williams)    This song reminds me of Madonna's hugely successful single \\"Hung Up.\\" But in \\"Candy Shop\\" Madonna uses the sounds of synths and electronic equipment, her lyrics are both strong and funny. As usual Madonna is often using innuendo as she sings \\"Don't pretend you're not hungry, there's plenty to eat...\\"     2) 4 MINUTES - 4:04 (produced by: Madonna, Timothy Mosley, Nate Hills & Justin Timberlake)   (featuring Justin Timberlake)  This is one of my very favorite songs on the CD for all the same reasons why the entire world loves it. 4 Minutes is fast and beautiful and breathtaking. Madonna's theme de jour on this track is love and s-e-x! This song totally sounds futuristic; I wouldn't be surprised if my grandbabies listened to this song.     3) GIVE IT 2 ME - 4:47 (produced by: Madonna & Williams)    Both Warner Bros. and Madonna are very interested in using this song as the 2nd single for \\"Hard Candy,\\" because it helps bridge the gap between Madonna's older sound and newer sound. On this track, Madonna's pure bubblegum pop as she sings \\"if you can handle it, undress me...\\"      4) HEARTBEAT - 4:03 (produced by: Madonna & Williams)    This is such a fantastic studio album track because it has the potential to be a number 1 single. It has such a catchy hook but it's not one that will knock you out too soon.     5) MILES AWAY -  4:48 (produced by: Madonna, Mosley, Hills & Timberlake)   It's ethereal, mid tempo and guitar-heavy. It has that fabulous hand clapping bit during the middle which reminds everyone that Madonna's an original who sets her own rules.     6) SHE'S NOT ME - 6:04 (produced by: Madonna & Williams)    OMG so muchlike \\"Thief of Hearts.\\" Madonna sings about someone who's obsessed with her and who dresses like her, but there can only be one Madonna!     7) INCREDIBLE - 6:19 (produced by: Madonna & Williams)    A ravishing slow ballad which reminds me of what Madonna said in her \\"Something to Remember\\" CD, \\"it's about the music & it's always been about the music.\\"     8) BEAT GOES ON - 4:26 (produced by: Madonna, Kanye West & Williams )  (featuring Kanye)    This song has come a long way since it was first leaked to the net, last summer. Fans will appreciate the album track much more because it's totally reminiscent of New York's underground disco life of the 70's and early 80's that Madonna was so much a part of. Kanye is such a superior singer, producer, entertainer who both compliments and adds to something already perfect!     9) DANCE 2NITE - 5:03 (produced by: Madonna, Mosley, Hannon Lane & Timberlake)    Madonna has totally retrogressed to her \\"you can dance\\" days with this record because it's totally hedonistic and pleasurable and danceable. Although it does have somewhat of a dark feel to it.     10) SPANISH LESSON - 3:37 (produced by: Madonna, Williams)    Madonna opens the song with, \\"Yo te quiero means I love you.\\" This is a fast-moving Spanish/English track. As Madonna's fans know already know, she has a passion and a talent for sining in Spanish.        11) DEVIL WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU -  5:09 (produced by: Madonna, Joe Henry, Mosley, Hills & Timberlake)   Madonna purrs \\"Over and over you're pushing me onto the floor and I keep coming back for more\\" in her sexy sweet-sounding melody that is all too familiar by now. This song isn't exactly a ballad but it does have a somewhat somber tone, as it opens.     12) VOICES - 3:39 (produced by: Madonna, Mosley, Hills, Lane, Timberlake)    This is perhaps Madonna's most out-there track. She saved the most unique and personal song for the end, with lyrics like \\"Are you walking the dog or is that dog walking you.     These 2remixes are included on the Special Edition: 4 Minutes ~ Tracy Young House Mix Edit & 4 Minutes ~ Rebirth Anthem Mix Edit...! And, RING MY BELL - 3:54 ~ is included on the Japanese CD.     These songs all fit together precisely and have such an urban-retro sound that's almost coercive; this reviewer wouldn't be surprised if Madonna took up cage fighting in her next video. Even though Madonna worked with a slew of optimal producers, \\"Hard Candy\\" still has a very raw feeling that is almost reminiscent of [[ASIN:B000002MFN Erotica]], because there's such a dark sonance to it. But like [[ASIN:B000002NJS Ray of Light]] this CD does offer some hope of a new beginning as well, because of its sleek sound that's polished, edgy and very fast-moving. Of course if you go to your local record store (do they still call 'em record stores?) you'd find this CD in the pop section because that's just what Madonna's been for all these years; popular. However, on \\"Hard Candy\\" she mixes just a touch of disco, R&B, hip hop, hard rock and maybe even a dash of Catholic Guilt for good measure!      Always the tireless perfectionist, Madonna would never stop until she amassed a complete and total masterpiece. Compared to her last CD, 05's blockbuster [[ASIN:B000B8QEZG Confessions on a Dance Floor]], Madonna really had an abundance more to get off of her music-loving chest on \\"Hard Candy.\\" This is a dance record, but more than that, it's an inner-reflection to the catalyst's heart. When asked about the differences between these 2 CD's recently, Madonna said: On \\"Confessions,\\" which I wrote all the lyrics to, I wanted to stay away from anything serious... and with this one I wanted to dig deeper and go to a different place. For me, it's a true collaboration, intellectually and artistically.      Here she comes, are you ready for her? To Kick off \\"Hard Candy\\" Madonna will be performing some of her latest, greatest hits at Roseland, tomorrow, for a special invitation-only concert; for only her luckiest fans. The Roseland concert will be streamed on MSN, and she'll also be performing at 2 other special events in London and Paris. If you miss her don't worry though because Madonna plans to kick off her Hard Candy World Tour at London's Wembley Stadium next September. Hello...Gorgeous. Ester is Back...! ..Music stores like the Virgin Megastore in NY, London and LA are giving away free gifts to celebrate the release of \\"Hard Candy.\\" And, there's a ton of stuff for \\"4 Minutes\\" as it was simultaneously released around the world, at the same time as HARD CANDY! There are about a trillion different CDs, records and lots of other promotional items in commemoration of \\"Hard Candy.\\" Here are just some of the merch you could expect to see from everyone's favorite Goddess of S-E-X:     [[ASIN:B00169XU8I Hard Candy Special Edition CD w/ Candy Box]]: Besides, the standard album, as well as all of the singles & remix CDs for \\"4 Minutes\\", there's also an awesome limited edition CD for the full-length album. Warner Music has faithfully released limited edition CDs since \\"Ray of Light\\" (prior to that, they only did it intermittently in certain countries or only on a promotional basis,) and the one for HARD CANDY is the very best! I'm crazy about this because it is so unique and well put together and it actually includes extra pictures and that cool little candy box! Also, the new limited edition CD is finally priced at sell-through prices (in the past they would always be at least thirty five or higher) and it's finally offered up quickly at the same time as the regular CD is offered! ...This also includes 2 remixes of \\"4 Minutes!!\\" And there's a very beautiful booklet with over 30 pages!! This is exactly what fans want! Get this and keep it sealed!     \\"Hard Candy\\" Limited Edition \\"Candy Box\\" CDs overseas: In addition, there will be a limited edition for Japan, the UK and Australia. But (with the exception of the Japanese lyrics/characters) these CDs will be no different from the US limited edition release and these will likely not be available on Amazon (however, you can find them on eBay or through esprit.)      \\"Hard Candy\\" Commercial CDs from Asia: There is an awesome CD from Taiwan which includes a Taiwanese lyric booklet and a pull-out picture that some sellers are calling a \\"poster.\\" There's a very rare CD from China which is pressed in very limited quantities. And there's a Singaporean CD which is also very similar to the US release. In addition, there is also a [[ASIN:B00151W394 Japanese CD]] which includes the lyrics to the songs (in English & Japanese) which Amazon is offering. The Japanese CD also includes the bonus track \\"Ring My Bell.\\" Although, none of these other CDs will be offered on Amazon, but you can find them on eBay.      \\"Hard Candy\\" Commercial CDs from Europe, Australia & South America: These aren't very special and are nearly exactly the same as the US CD. Amazon will not be offering any of these CDs, except for 1 which is pressed by [[ASIN:B0017PCLTA WEA ]]; only die-hard collectors would get this, though.      [[ASIN:B0016OOM7Q Hard Candy 3-LP Vinyl w/ CD]]: This includes the full-length album on 3 special edition vinyls, 2 of the LPs are \\"candy colored,\\" and this also includes the full CD, as well!      \\"Hard Candy\\" Cassette Album: This is again something for only die-hard collectors. The US & the UK stopped manufacturing cassettes at least 5-6 years ago. However, this album is available on cassette in Malaysia and Thailand. These will not be sold on Amazon, but you may be able to find them on eBay.      [[ASIN:B0018CAANG Hard Candy downloads & bonus tracks ]]: This includes bonus remixes for \\"4 Minutes\\" as well as the tracks \\"Ring My Bell\\" (through iTunes) & \\"Give it to Me.\\"      Promotional-Only LPs, CDs & other items: There is a US & UK promo LP. In addition, I am told that there is a very rare promo LP w/ gatefold from Japan. And there's a promo CD from the US, as well as a lot of other items such as acetates and promotional CDs for \\"4 Minutes.\\" There will also be a picture disc released for at least one of the singles and WEA may also put the full long play on p/d as well. You may be able to find some of these items on eBay, or a better place is through esprit.      You will experience merriment of emotions which run the gamut of abhorrence to delectation as you listen to this record, \\"Hard Candy.\\" This is the reason why Madonna is not just an artist, but the Defining Pioneer. With her freshest work of art, this modern-day iconoclast is asking the question, giving the answer and simultaneously luring the listener into her den of pleasure, all at once...!
B000P0J02E|5.0|This CD is great to listen to if your are cleaning house or typing on computer, etc. If you loved all the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, this is the soundtrack for you. When you hear each piece, it brings you back to each scene of the movie.

B000P12LWY|5.0|Even if you are not a history buff like I am, you will love the Tudors Season 1.  The story lines are fast paced and exciting, and the eye candy for both men and women is extensive!
B00003CXA2|5.0|Still one of my favorite movies! What a great story! Even though it's a bit longer than most, this is one for the movie appreciation classes of the future! From every angle of movie-making (how in the world did they create Tom Hanks shaking the president's hand?) this one reminds me of Citizen Kane and the lengths Orson Welles went through to create a movie for the ages. Phenomenal!
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|I think it's really cool that Madonna decided to do something different with this album, and gave the techno music a break. It's a good album, but Confessions was much more cohesive and stronger. I just wish people would just give Madonna more credit instead of bashing her creative choices. There were only a couple of songs I did not like, but other than that it's a great record to dance to.<br /><br />Candy Shop-The best song on the album!!!!! It's a great song to listen to and she should definately released this as a single. You will find the phrase \\"My sugar is raw...sticky n sweet\\" catchy in your head 5/5<br /><br />4 Minutes-Another great song to dance. It will keep you moving on the dancefloor and the ironic part of this song is it's exactly 4 minutes! 5/5<br /><br />Give It 2 Me- Cool. It sounds very retro. 5/5<br /><br />Heartbeat-I just love the part where she says \\"see my booty get down\\". 5/5<br /><br />Miles Away-Great 5/5<br /><br />She's Not Me-Don't really like this song. 2/5<br /><br />Incredible-I wasn't too crazy with this song. It was like listening to paris hilton and I don't like Paris Hilton. It was okay at least in the beginning. 3/5<br /><br />Beat Goes On (featuring Kanye West)-I like this song. the duet with Kanye West was cool. It reflects the dance music of the 70s especially the R&B soul. 4.5/5<br /><br />Dance 2night- Good. 4/5<br /><br />Spanish Lesson-Not really my favorite. 3/5<br /><br />Devil Wouldn't Recognize You-Good. It sounds awfully alot like JT's What Goes Around. 4/5<br /><br />Voices-Wonderful 5/5
B00005K3O4|4.0|The movie starts out in the typical 1980's fashion. Bad music highlighted with make out sessions in the woods, geeks with coke bottle glasses and lots of cheap beer. At first you'd think this is the run of the mill type B-Movie, that is until the klowns land in their circus tent spaceship. Curious people cannot seem to resist the colourful tent in the middle of nowhere. Once the klowns get bored of the woods, they wreck havoc on the bewildered towns folk. The klowns are somewhat clumbsy and oversized, but pack a lot of killer gags. How can one resist pies that melt people to the bone, popcorn that borns little klowns, colourful toy laser guns that kill or shadow puppets that can eat groups of unsuspecting people? Want more, how about really bad acting, sub par script, super low budget sets with even super lower effects and scary looking klowns with sharp rotten teeth. Even better yet, it all seems to work in this campy and cheesey cult classic.
B0011QC9U6|5.0|Saw this movie in the Imax theater (in 3D) and it was awesome. And now that I have it on HD DVD its still just as good. Especially on my nice 42\\" Flat panel (1080p). One of the best looking films of 07.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|I have never been too excited about any past band members going out on their own to do solo projects UNTIL NOW! this cd is awesome from beginning to end and Nikki Sixx did a fantastic job! I can't wait to hear more of his work.After each song is over I couldn't wait to hear the next one. I have read the book \\"The Heroin Diaries\\" and this is a great addition. I most definitely recommend this to any of Nikki's fans, Sixx A.M fans or even those who have never heard of either...if that's possible.
9626343532|5.0|These Sherlock Holmes adventures are very enjoyable and entertaining either at home or in the car. This is not an actual production with actors and sound effects, but a single person David Timmons, truly a \\"man of a thousand voices and dialects\\"..... both male and female.<br /><br />The \\"read by David Timmons\\" on the box implies is David just reads the stories, however he acts out the stories using a variety of voices to bring the various characters to life...a marvelous and talented performance by him.<br /><br />In my opinion Clive Merrison is the best audio book Sherlock; however David Timmons is definitely a respectable second!
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Madonna is pretty much the only female artist I will listen to these days. With respect and a nod to her age (almost 50), some of the tunes on this album were shared with a party full of VERY youthful 50-somethings on Saturday night (Madonna had made these tunes available for listening on her myspace over the past weekend). Every single tune had everyone up on the floor fast-beat dancing and the slower tunes were nice to Salsa dance to! It's not quite as disco as \\"Confessions\\" but is still extremely rhythmic with full backbeat. Not truly hip-hop, as earlier reviews might have suggested. There are some wild remixes out there for \\"4 minutes\\", the very best of which is Bob Sinclair's Space Funk remix - full-on disco'ish. Everyone seems to believe that Madonna is merely jumping on the Timberlake/Timbaland/Pharrell/Kanye bandwagon with this release, but oh, my god, the lady most definitely holds her own with these nouveau powerhouses.<br /><br />And my 26 year old daughter, who adores Timberlake of course, absolutely loves \\"4 Minutes\\" naturally. She swears she'll be first in line today to get this new album.<br /><br />Best cuts on this album are \\"Candy Shop\\" and \\"She's Not Me\\" -- great lyrics for both - \\"Candy Shop\\" is full of sweet tongue-in-cheek double entender, and \\"She's Not Me\\" is just a fabulous dumped lover-type song. Great for listening to post-breakup and broken hearted.<br /><br />I didn't think much of her in the 80's but now I personally admire her - I am turning 50 2 weeks after she does this year. The gal simply has style, everlasting endurance, energy and class. Go Madonna! Please come to Seattle for your Hard Candy tour!
B0014DBZT2|4.0|From the start of the album to the end, Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds never disappoint. It is the perfect companion to last year's Grinderman album.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|Instead of using traditional movie camera film, the producers of \\"Cloverfield\\" decided to rely instead on film from a hand-held camcorder to shoot the scenes of the movie.  The result is a fairly scary film, but the camcorder filming is very difficult to watch.    As for the movie itself, Rob (Michael Stahl-David) has just received a cushy new job in Japan.  Rob's brother Jason (Mike Vogel) and his girlfriend Lily (Jessica Lucas) have decided to throw Rob a surprise going away party.  As the guests begin to arrive, Jason asks his friend Hud (T.J. Miller) to videotape some goodbye messages for Rob.  Among the guests is Rob's ex-girlfriend Beth (Odette Yustman), who has shown up with her new boyfriend.  Also there is Marlena (Lizzy Caplan).  Rob and Beth get into a heated argument, and she and her boyfriend leave the party.    Just as the party's beginning to get going, a loud noise occurs outside and all of the lights in Manhattan suddenly go dark.  Something very large has begun an all-out assault on the city.  The startled guests run outside to see a large creature destroying buildings, vehicles and other people. Instead of running away from the creature, Rob, Jason, Lily, Marlena and Hud decide to try to rescue Beth, who's apartment is in mid-town and just happens to be directly in the path of the creature.  Hud has also kept the camcorder running.  What results is a frantic trek across mid-town Manhattan in a desparate search to save Beth before the creature gets there first.  Will Rob and his friends survive, or will the creature get them?    I thought this movie was scary in some parts, but I had a difficult time watching due to the constant jumping of the film.  I thought that the camcorder idea was interesting, but it did make viewing the movie much more difficult than if it would have been filmed in a normal manner.  Also, I was disappointed that I never got a real clear look at the creature.  I thought that the special effects were pretty good, especially the head of the Statue of Liberty rolling down the street.    Overall, I did enjoy this movie, but I think it could have been better.
0307155102|5.0|I always purchas this book for baby showers and any gift for very young children.  It is wonderful to use for early language development or anyone wishing to learn the English names for nouns.  My son wore out three copies and I always kept at least one copy in my classroom as well as my home.  Cheryl White
1416960953|5.0|Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide is a must have for the fan of the movie and the books.  My son read all the books in the series, then saw the movie.  He saw the Field Guide and just had to have it.  Found it on Amazon.com and purchased it, since it arrived he hasn't put it down.  He has even gone back and reread the books since he has the actual Field Guide to see the 'creatures'.  Definitely won't be disappointed with this one!
B0007TKNIS|1.0|Of all the singers at their disposal, the guy they chosen for Phantom sucks!  He's flat and off key many times, and is just horrible.  Sub par performance, plus really crappy makeup effect for the Phantom as well.  Christine and Raoul are well played and are the ONLY glimmer of hope.  This is a rental ~ not a purchase.  It's not a movie you'll watch over and over.  I've seen the play several times with many different actors from Michael Crawford to Robert Guillaume ~ and a muppet would have sung better than this clown.  What a disappointment!
B00005JKED|5.0|Well , it was a great movie, the quality seems perfect and i enjoy getting dvd or whatever from Amazon . I will shop here more. i shop on here more than i do @ phyisal locations . for dvd's & games
B0013BNY2Q|3.0|Stipe's vocals are best when you can't quite make out what he is singing.  Even better are tracks where the lines you can make out don't make sense either.  Accelerate's lyrics unfortunately continue the clear departure from greater works.    Unlike the vocals, the overall sound of the recording is less than crystal.  It is almost as if R.E.M. is trying a tad too hard to sound like a fresh-from-the-scene band rather than an experienced music machine.    There is nothing like previous delights involving two-headed cows, voices of Harold, heads there to move you around, or  swallowing the ocean.   Cohesiveness is harder to describe, but you know when you don't hear it.    The short time of the album may be a concern, but Spoon has produced an album recently of similar duration that had enough to keep me coming back over and over.  Opinions differ, but for me I like the good stuff -- even if you can spare just a pinch.     This is certainly a better album.  However, I find myself left with the existential question, \\"Is it only good because Around the Sun was so bad?\\"
B0012K1ILW|4.0|Another great album by Erykah Badu. Don't expect every song to be like Honey and you wont be disappointed.
B000003JAB|5.0|This is truly a classic and my favorite album of all-time.  From Day of the Eagle to Little Bit of Sympathy this album is Trower is at his best.  There's not a single bad song on this album.  If you know Trower then you obviously know this album and if you're not familiar with him then buy this disc.  You may choose the two for one version or if it's still available the version with bonus live tracks is also terrific.
0345479092|5.0|This book is great for the first time moms, it talks about different feelings and reactions to motherhood, most of people think that maternal instict flow by itself and all that stuff, but is not always like that, the circunstances are different as well, and most important the book does not really generalize, I mean it does not say \\"the babies are always like that\\" or something.<br />Also describe some experiences of Tracy when she worked for several couples in US, and she talks about different ways that first time mothers faced the motherhood, this was very interesting cause is a big challenge combine motherhood and career.<br />It has a great concept which is EASY: Eat, Act, Sleep, Yourself. It is not a rigid system that demand to be followed a rigid schedule, is just a guide that can be adapted to each particular child. And it teaches your children to follow routines. And also offer time for yourself, have a baby is demanding and exhaustive!<br />About the breastfeeding, Tracy does not really talks agains breastfeeding, she just state that every woman has the right to choose and not to feel guilty about it, by the way my niece is 6 months old, he only received breastfeeding 1.5 months and so far he hasn't suffered any sickness. I still believe that breastfeeding is better, but if somebody because of a circunstance choose not to breastfeeding she shouldn't feel guilty.<br />Regarding the issue of attachmental parenting, I see it in this way: I guess the nature says we have to keep the baby with us, I just watched in TV a program about gorillas and they bring the babies with them all the time, but the current life style many times does not allow to do that, because for example, I have to return to work 3 months later, so I can't carry on my baby all the time. But if somebody else likes this style and is able to do it is great, but there should be options, there is no only one an absolut truth.<br />As always it's important to know that we need to know how to read, it means read, understand, use our common sense, question the issues, and compare.derstand, use our common sense, question the issues, and compare.
0446691437|4.0|I got this book because it came so highly recommended from various artists I know and respect.<br /><br />I read thru it in one night (not a large book) and can't say I feel its as \\"mind blowing\\" or as \\"the best book ever\\" as others have told me.<br /><br />It's a great book if you are floundering and don't know why, to look at how you are self saboetaging yourself and your art/creative career.<br /><br />I think its a good book, if you know what your problems are, working on them but still slipping back into old habits.<br /><br />I think its an so so book if you know these things and are actively doing better for yourself.<br /><br />In the first section- he talks about the various forms of Resistance and why it impedes progress and growth. That is really helpful for those who can't see what they are doing wrong. The second section just goes over all the points in the first.<br /><br />There are a few things that I really didn't agree with in the book such as \\"workshops are a waste of money\\". I don't think any amount of education is a waste of money, even if the lesson is you don't need to spend $$ on the current level of learning.  Another was \\"dreamers never go anywhere\\". Everything in the world started as an idea in someones head, or their 'dream'.  I agree that people who ONLY dream but don't act never go anywhere, but dont' say every dreamer is a loser-its just not true.<br /><br />Overall, its helpful. Definately not the best book for me at this time, but I know it will be a breakthrough for many people. 3 years ago I would have said he could be channeling my life so I can see how it would resonate with alot of people.<br /><br />I would recommend James Ray's books/dvds in addition to this book if you are serious about wanting to change your life on every level too.
B000000OAC|4.0|Queen's prolific output in the 70s was typically schizophrenic and News of the World represented the extremes of Queen's capabilities.  With everything from rock to soul to ballads to jazzy blues standards thrown in - the album's repertoire reflected the individual musical personalities of the band occasionally working together (as with the opening songs), or at times, diverging in their own style.<br /><br />The album's strongest tracks - We Will Rock You and We Are the Champions - defined the group as a superband, and made them instant legends.  Even if they had never recorded another song, those two tracks would remain synonymous with Queen.  Unfortunately, because of this as well, the rest of the album (in my humble opinion) has had a somewhat tougher time living up to its knockout opening.  Where A Night At the Opera builds up towards the majesty of Bohemian Rhapsody, the trajectory and magnetism of NOTW tapers off a bit.<br /><br />That's not to say that this is a bad album.  But I've found it (like A Day at the Races) slightly fragmentary.  But no-one should be surprised, for to listen to Queen is to invite the unexpected.<br /><br />The other real gems for me here are Spread Your Wings - another classic Queen song - and Melancholy Blues.<br /><br />Fight From the Inside is aggressive and cool.  Get Down Make Love is pure Queen camp and kitsch (ala Death on 2 Legs), while Sheer Heart Attack is Queen's versatile nod to punk rock.  It's Late is nice too.  All Dead All Dead is incredibly melancholy.  The remaining tracks - while not filler, don't hold up so well for me and have been performed better by the band in other similar incarnations.<br /><br />Although the album remains indispensable for most Queen fans, I'd like to say this is really a 3.5 star album for me compared to Night at the Opera.  Far better than A Day At the Races, it's worth getting to experience Queen approaching their 70s peak.  Queen was truly astonishing in their abilities and this album displays some of their genius.
0307265730|5.0|Beautiful writing, compelling stories. I don't even like short stories but I love this book.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|I had to buy this soundtrack as soon as I saw the movie, \\"Once.\\"  The soundtrack did not disappoint.  Of course it includes the incredible Oscar winning song, \\"Falling Slowly,\\" but it also includes many other moving musical gems.  It's a fairly mellow listen, but the angst of Glen Hansard's character over his lost love comes through on several tracks.  These are songs about being in love and losing love, and they are well worth buying the full CD.

0307387151|5.0|Ian McEwan's absorbing novel will transport the reader quickly into the world of 13 year old Briony Tallis and the people who surround her.  The first part of the book lyrically describes a lost world, pre-WW II Britain, and the privileged life of the Tallises. We are transported into the rich inner world of Briony as we glide through her acute perceptions and fanciful imaginings.<br /><br /> The second part of the book, containing graphic descriptions of a brutal war, is rather rough going.  As a mother, I found myself identifying with Briony's mother, Emily, whose life was devoted to protecting and nourishing her offspring; and then, contrasting Emily's constant attending, multi-tasking, balancing often conflicting motives among her children---to the merciless scenes of destruction and death during WWII.<br /><br /> The central theme is Briony's misunderstanding of two encounters between her older sister, Cecilia, and Robbie Turner, and the disaster this brings upon them.  Despite the serious repercussions, this misunderstanding could be viewed on one level as a slender thread upon which to hang a novel.  McEwan's masterful presentation of inner and outer realities, and his depiction of a long-ago time with its pleasures and horrors, elevates his tale into an artful endeavor to be savored.
0061245097|3.0|I wanted to say that I absolutely loved the first book in this new series, Halfway to the Grave and I was eagerly anticipating this next one in the Night Huntress Series. I very quickly realized that it was not what I had been hoping for.   In the book, One Foot in the Grave, four years have gone by since Cat Crawfield last saw Bones, her former lover. He quickly reenters the picture and helps her out like he did in the previous book. As a reader I did not feel like any time has gone by and the characters certainly don't act like their separation, due to Cat's well-meaning attempt to protect the people she loves, has been much of a trial at all for either of them. I was extremely disappointed when Bones meets up with Cat again and has almost no hard feelings for the way she ran and hid from him for over four years. It felt completely anticlimactic and I was left wondering why the author would even bother setting up this separation in the last book only to be so quickly resolved in this one.   I had other issues with this book, one was this general sense of choppiness in the storyline but also with the characters. We're quickly introduced to her best friend Denise who we do not really see too much of and really is only used as a way for Cat and Bones to coincidentally meet again when they both attend Denise's wedding. In the beginning a member of Cat's team dies  and yes, we've been told they've known each other for four years, but I really couldn't have cared less. I especially did not like the attempt at an emotional ending when they brought him back to life as a ghoul because I kept thinking, who is this character and why should I care?!  Having said all that I am not giving up on the author. I think this was a transitional book in the series and hopefully the next one will have better timing and character development.

B00007KQA3|5.0|If there was any one single book I would peg for being inaccessible to a successful film adaptation, it would be George Orwell's \\"1984\\".  How could any director bring to life Orwell's cautionary, almost unbearably nightmarish literary dystopia to the screen without screwing up even in the tiniest way?  Orwell's body of work is remarkable not only for the scope of his political imagination, but the tiny idiosyncrasies of imagination which make the reader uncomfortable.<br /><br />Well, kudos to Michael Radford, because he did exactly that, and then some.  This is perfect.  And I mean perfect in the classical sense; without flaw.  I remember first seeing it on the Sci-fi channel as a kid and it lodged in my memory like a tick; the scenes with Winston (played with a kind of wounded, vulnerable purity by Jonn Hurt) and the melancholy monster O' Brien (played with a chillingly resigned, Shakespearean delicacy by Richard Burton) in the party's interrogation/toture chamber are absolutely unforgettable.  Despite being his last role while dying of liver cancer, this has to be one of Burton's best performances.<br /><br />The future is not some paradise filled with new invetions or moving sidewalks.  It is an impoverished, shrapnel ridden hell where Winston narrowly navigates his way to something like life, at least inside.  His job as a member of Oceania's Party is to destroy the past; he scratches out newspapers, discards photographs of party members (or not), and against his own will takes place in the gigantic Crime Against Humanity that the world has become.  Radford's aesthetic sensibilities were perfectly surreal; the telescreen of Big Brother is still, beige and illuminated, and you actually feel as though he is \\"watching\\".  Orwell obviously took a lot of inspiration from Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia; as Winston and Julia (played wonderfully by Suzanna Hamilton) stand and cheer, the man on the telescreen looks a great deal like Rudolph Hess.<br /><br />Winston and Julia lose, just as in the book, and badly.  Everyone is a traitor (sound familiar?).  Burton easily takes Winston in, betrays, tortures and successfully brainwashes him.  \\"Humanity is the Party\\".<br /><br />I cannot believe that some of the reviewers here have the guts to claim there are no parallels between this film and our world.  Just as in the movie, we are continually lied to about war, who we are fighting, and as O'Brien tells Winston, we are drugged on notions of false \\"victory\\".  An obvious parallel is that during one week in Winston's Oceania the country is at war with Eastasia, then Eurasia: at one period of time we are at war with Iran, the next Iraq, then as an afterthought perhaps, Afghanistan.<br /><br />Anyway, this is more than a must see: this is an work of art that cannot be missed in this lifetime.as in the book, and badly.

B000ETQR3Q|2.0|From my son: Monkey see, monkey want. I got the Longshot for Christmas '06.  The moral of the story is: don't believe everything you see in a commercial. It showed great accuracy; what a joke.  And the commercial claim, \\"Everything you need to blast your skills to the next level.\\" should have been, \\"Everything you need to spend $30.00 on, to ruin your kid's Christmas (or any child's birthday.\\").  Bottom line: this gun stinks, and I would DEFINITELY NOT recommend this toy.  To ANYONE.
B0012E6R3W|4.0|For once it's refreshing to see a band's promise about a forthcoming release actually live up to how they hype that it will sound like.<br /><br />Testament's 1st album of all new material in 9 years  was billed by the band of having the songwriting style of their classic 80's material while featuring the much more aggressive playing style/production of 1999's The Gathering (which is still a most amazing album.)  Well, that's what we got with The Formation of Damnation.<br /><br />To be honest, this isn't as great of an album as The Gathering was, and this is coming from a long time fan who has been listening to the band since 1987.  I still greatly appreciate their classic material but I felt that with The Gathering the band really reached their apex (depsite the fact that Chuck Billy and Eric Peterson were the only 2 original members left in the group by that point).  But The Formation of Damnation is still a very good release that will please long time fans (of Bay Area thrash in particular) while not being quite as earth shattering as it needed to be to convert current audiences into new fans.<br /><br />Song wise the album isn't as thrashy or as brutal as the Gathering with maybe the exception of the crushing title track.  Writing wise a lot of this sounds like The New Order and Practice What you Preach styles with a more brutal guitar/drum attack.  Chuck Billy still occasionally dips into his 90's death metal growl at times, but he doesn't do it nearly as much as he did during that period. He sings here much more in his older style and while his range isn't what it used to be he still turns in a tremendous performance. Returning original lead guitarist Alex Skolnick does his usual brilliant guitar work and drummer Paul Bostaph (who played on their Return to Apocalyptic City E.P.) does his always solid and fantastic drum work. Original bass player Greg Christian returns and I was a bit disappointed by how root oriented his playing was on this album, but it still does fit, just don't expect some of his memorable bass lines from yesteryear (with the exception being the final track Leave Me Forever which features a fantastic bass line throughout and was co-written by Greg Christian ironically enough).  Eric Peterson still remains one of the most criminally underrated rhythm guitarists (who also can rip great leads) in all of metal and his riff work here is great as always.<br /><br />Seeing as this is basically a new fresh start for this band,  it should be interesting to see how they are able to build on this release as while not being their best work is still much better than a lot of people are probably expecting out of it.expect some of his memorable bass lines from yesteryear (with the exception being the final track Leave Me Forever which features a fantastic bass line throughout and was co-written by Greg Christian ironically enough).

B0014KD46W|5.0|As well as pays homage to it in a way that only one of the original maestros of Rock could do! A must Buy for Winwood Fans. This work brings Classic Rock into the 21st Century! I see that working with Eric Clapton for the past year has brought Winwood back to his Blind Faith and Classic Traffic Roots i.e. John Barleycorn era. Many of the chords sound familar, I heard chords from past Traffic works like Empty Pages, Paper Sun and Dear Mr. Fantasy in some of the new tracks, as well as similar chords from Yes's Roundabout on the new tune We're All Looking.  The collaboration with Clapton on Dirty City not only revisits the Blind Faith (all too brief) era but expands and enhances each artists growth over the last 40 years!  Hopefully new Rock Artists will listen,learn and move forward into this Expansion of Classic Rock. The door has now been swung open, it is up to the masses to keep it that way. Classic Rock could retake front and center from the long vast wastelands of Pop, amateur contests and Corporate Rock.  Kudos to Winwood for taking the risk and leaving behind his more recent commercial works like Back in The Highlife Again and Arc of The Diver. Steve is one of the leaders today in rock/jazz, rock/folk and rock/blues. Long Live Rock!

James Woods delivers a razor-sharp, thoughtful and compelling performance as Shark, and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute.  Jeri Ryan was enjoyable in her role, as were the other characters.  Finely crafted story arcs and nice camera work on the entire series in a fast-paced, engaging format that's very re-watchable.<br /><br />Mostly I really liked James Woods in this series, he was fantastic - nice job, and thanks for doing it right.  Great example of a world class actor breathing life into scripts that extended their range dramatically... it shows.  Edgy, well-told and professional.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />-ken
B001437DMA|5.0|Joe Satriani's new album is quite eclectic, diverse, and really showcases many of Joe's talents and his songwriting  abilities, which I think are especially evident on this album. From the moment I popped it in my CD player I was instantly impressed, entertained and was definitely \\"ready to rock\\"! The extra DVD in the package is just icing on the cake, with some great moments from in the studio! The whole segment on \\"I Just Wanna Rock\\" was hilarious, especially when they slapped aluminum foil all over Joe so he looked like this robot in his song! Great stuff!<br /><br />Speaking of great stuff, the music in this album is excellent and displays lots of new sounds and techniques. Some heavier songs like \\"Overdriver\\" and the closer \\"Andalusia\\" are some real treats! There are a couple slower songs like \\"Come on Baby\\" that take a bit longer to get going but are still very nice pieces of music nonetheless. My favorite songs are \\"Revelation\\", Musterion\\" \\"Diddle-Y-A-Doo-Dat\\" and the aforementioned \\"Andalusia\\". The last one especially is cool because it starts out with this Spanish-sounding guitar, hand claps, and an upright bass and then about halfway through cranks up into a cool rocker - a superb song to end the CD with!<br /><br />In all, Prof Satch has delivered a terrific piece of work, one of my favorites right up there with \\"Surfing\\", \\"Crystal\\" and \\"Is There Love\\", among the rest, all of which I love to listen to! Can't wait to see him in concert! If you haven't yet purchased this album, I would absolutely recommend it. There is something for everyone in it without being too weird. Thank you Joe for giving us yet another wonderful work of art!

B0013D8LOK|4.0|If you can stand the violence of this film (which, to be honest, is more theatrical than realistically done) this is a fun movie. The music is very intricately orchestrated and sung and the look is very Burton-esque in it's stylized appearance. Johnny Depp brings some real gravitas to his role as a barber who has had everything taken from him that he has ever loved.
0743298039|5.0|A dear friend of mine recommended this book to me. And after knowing that her taste in literature is fantastic, in my opinion, I immediately picked this up at the local library. I am quite impressed.<br /><br />Diane Setterfield's language is gorgeous, and she really has a way of making the story flow. I found myself frustrated if I had to stop reading and go into work. I just wanted to know all of old Miss Winter's, as well as Margaret Lea's, secrets. Not knowing and having to wait until the end was maddening -- and I love it when a book gives me that feeling! You can have a few thoughts in your mind on how exactly the story was going to end, but I honestly did not know everything when I thought I did -- just like Margaret.<br /><br />I admit that the part between the beginning of the book and the middle started to somewhat lose my interest. Well, it's more that I found it a little disturbing, like the people who didn't like the book. But above all Diane more than makes up for it as the story goes along. In fact, I felt that my brief loss of interest didn't even occur as I liked it more and more as I went along. My recommendation is to give it a try and keep going. If you find yourself not enjoying it at first, maybe as it goes along you will begin to. I know that sounds absurd, but I always feel that giving a book a chance is worth it.<br /><br />All in all, I would say that \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" is a pretty darn good book to read. Definitely the type of book that you want to either curl up under a blanket or lay in the grass and become engrossed in. A book that has you try and \\"skip ahead\\" like Margaret does, but you still don't know everything like you thought you did. You'll know what I mean when you give it a try.
B00005JPMZ|4.0|This is a mostly enjoyable rendition of our terrapin friends. The story is pretty basic and straightforward, but it definitely feels like they developed it with a companion video game in mind. Many scenes just feel like they were meant to be great levels on the video game based on the movie.<br /><br />If you can get past that, however, the action is actually done quite well.<br /><br />The one thing that is really missing here is the lightheartedness of the first films. Whether you loved or hated those films, they definitely had more humor than this rather dour version. (I personally loved the first two, but the third one suffered from much more than sub-par animatronics due to the fact that the Jim Henson Company wasn't interested in doing the third one.)<br /><br />Not to say that there is no room for a more brooding version of the turtles. It works, for instance, rather well for Raphael since he is by far the more broody of the bunch. Leonardo also does a fair amount of brooding himself, always wondering what more he could be doing as the leader, not feeling up to the job. However it does Michaelangelo and Donatello a disservice. Their strong point (as characters) is largely built around their playful, quippy, snarky attitudes in situations of great danger. They get a couple of quips out here, but they feel forced and there are not enough of them to really get a feel for their characters.<br /><br />On the whole, I enjoyed the movie well enough, but I would have definitely preferred more for the cinematic return of the Turtle clan.<br /><br />**Mild Mild Spoiler Alert**<br /><br />They hint at a possible sequel, and I do hope that they get it out. This movie was largely bogged down by the attempt to re-introduce the characters to the movie-going audience. (April as a ninja? C'mon.) A sequel, however, would not be thusly hindered. Hopefully they could spend more development time in creating a very intriguing story and less screen time with the brothers fighting each other.

044022425X|4.0|Jamie and Claire establish a settlement deep in the North Carolina mountains far from the winds of change which has racked their lives. But the DRUMS OF AUTUMN concerns their daughter Brianna and the man who loves her enough to travel through time, Roger.<br />Neither of the second generation are strong enough to compete with the power of Jamie and Claire Fraizer. Time outs stop a story in its tracks and this installment in the series is no exception. If the reader is familiar with the story and has read the previous books then it is an acceptable read. But as a stand alone the title does not have enough substance to sustain it.<br />Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and SINS OF THE FATHERS.
B0016HNOXQ|3.0|been a long time, i didnt even know if they were still together, but they are, by far the best two song on this long awaited cd are WE CARRY ON and MACHINE GUN, some of the other songs, well, kinda dull the cd need some more of what these two tracks have. But, i feel i have heard this kinda sound before.....YES, if you like this kinda sound then check out the first two cd by the group flying lizzards the lizzards where way before there time, I am not saying this is not good, it has to grow on you. I just think if they would have done a few more songs like the two best track, it would have been a 4 for 3. god knows they have had enough time to make this cd great. It seems like they were too afraid to make it too pop. Like i said before, if you like this, take the time to check out the first cd release by the flying lizzards, yes its got the cover song MONEY. But after all these years for them, it still holds up. hope 3 can do the same as time goes on.
0385335997|5.0|The Battle of Culloden (1745) destroyed the Scottish nation, which only in recent years has regained national sovereignty. I was hooked before OUTLANDER because my own ancestors were expelled from Scotland after the 1715 rebellion to become the Scotch-Irish who emigrated from Ireland in 1721 bringing the red hair and green eyes with them. The very interesting thing about these early Americans is that both the men and women could read and write.<br />Diana Gabaldon creates outstanding characters who bring them to vivid life, not just faded names on deeds, wills, and church records. The VOYAGER bring Claire Randall and James Fraizer back together again and moves them through many adventures including Jamie's sea sickness to the shores of the American continent.<br />The historical details and events are so accurate you hang on every word for the thrill of what will happen next and a window into the journey taken by your own.<br />Who can resist a love story so powerful and enduring it transcends time like that of Tristan and Isolde to become a part of the fabric of our language?<br />Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and SINS OF THE FATHERS.

B0016HMYEQ|4.0|\\"Cloverfield\\" is a good movie. It is the best use of the \\"Blaire Witch\\" method since \\"The Blaire Witch Project\\" itself. This style keeps the movie from being just a 21st Century \\"Gozilla\\" remake, which would have to have been as bad as all other \\"Godzilla\\" sequals and remakes. Here, you are always in contact with the human situation and their disasterous plight - Nevermind if this stuff could ever happen. Who were all those people running through Tokyo streets in all those \\"Godzilla\\" movies anyways? How many close calls, and phone calls, did those guys make before getting squished by godzilla monsters? I bet they each had a back story. And who cares about a godzilla's back story or motivation? City-leveling, malevolant monsters are unsympathetic brutes and do not get a say. Maybe this movie isn't for everyone, but it would not have been as powerful if shot in the normal way we are used to feature films. The special effects are good. The acting, pacing, also good. The terrible thing is shown enough. Any more footage of it would hurt the realism of the movie. I saw \\"Cloverfield\\" on a PC screen in relatively low-rez, and still got a kick out of it. I highly recommend you see \\"Cloverfield\\". Even on the very off-chance you don't dig it.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Madonna brings us her latest album Hard Candy and it does not disappoint. The album is full of dance club hits with a splash of r and b mixed in. This is another good album from the biggest selling and Most Successful Female Recording Artist In History. I meant to give this album 4 out of 5 stars but I can not change it. If you are expecting a genius record like Ray of Light, Music, Confessions, or American Life (yes that was a great NOT political album at all) you will be disappointed, but if you are looking for fun care free music you will really enjoy this.<br /><br />CANDY SHOP is a great song to start off the album. The song is a very energetic song that is similar to the version that was leaked months ago, but this one has more beats and layers added to it. She seems to be having a blast singing this and brings back lots sexual innuendos for this song. Madonna sings \\"All the suckers are not all we sell in the store. Chocolate kisses so good you'll be beggin' for more. Don't pretend you're not hungry I've got plenty to eat. Come on in to my store cause my sugar is sweet!\\" This is a great song that will get you in the mood for the dance club or for working out at the gym. I do wish the album would have opened with a stronger song though because this one is a bit weak for an opening song.<br /><br />4 MINUTES was the first single from Madonna's Hard Candy album. The song is a very energetic radio friendly track that stays in your head. After being ignored by U.S. radio stations with her last 2 albums American Life, and Confessions on A Dance Floor, Madonna decided to take a different direction and work with hit makers Justin Timberlake and Timbaland. The result forced radio to no longer ignore Madonna and 4 Minutes became her most radio friendly hit in years. Madonna sings \\"I want somebody to speed it up for me then take it down slow there's enough room for both.\\" The song peaked at 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and became Madonna's 37th top ten hit pushing her past Elvis Presley as the artist with the most top 10 hits in history. 4 Minutes hit 1 on the Hot 100 Digital Song charts and is expected to bring her total sales for the single to over 1 million in just 5 weeks out it being out.<br /><br />GIVE IT TO ME is the next single to be released. The song also has a catchy beat that will sure get the dance floor crowd going. Once the chorus starts the club feel kicks in with the synths and Madonna sings \\"Give it to me, Yeah No one's gonna show me how. Give it to me, Yeah No one's gonna stop me now.\\" This is a great choice as the second single and shows Madonna still can come out with one heck of a killer dance tune! The remix that is on the Hard Candy Deluxe edition from Itunes is a great remix, and makes me wish believe the remixes of some of these songs might just outshine their originals.<br /><br />HEARTBEAT is one of my many favorite tracks on the new album. The song opens with a heartbeat sound and some synths, and has an amazing beat. The song has a great r and b/dance feel to it and is sure to heat up the charts and the clubs. Madonna sings \\"This complicated life I try to do my best. I always tell myself it's all just a test. For me it's an escape cause dancing makes you beautiful.\\" Heartbeat is classic Madonna  in top form and one of the best songs on the album! I wish Madonna would have stayed more in tune with songs like this on the new album.<br /><br />MILES AWAY is the closet thing to a ballad on the album. It starts out with a guitar and then turns in to an upbeat song with some sad lyrics in which Madonna sings \\"When no one's around then I have you here. I begin to see the picture, it becomes so clear. You always have the biggest heart, when we're six thousand miles apart.\\" This is one a beautiful slow songs Madonna, but lacks the power of her true ballads.<br /><br />SHE'S NOT ME has a funky beat to it in which Madonna describes is about the ultimate jilted lover. Madonna sings \\"She started dying her hair and wearing the same perfume as me. She's started reading my books and stealing my looks and lingerie.\\" This Madonna song brings us back to those Thief of Hearts Erotica days.<br /><br />INCREDIBLE is another great song that I really dig. It has a very positive message and an amazing rhythm. Madonna sings \\"Remembering the very first time you caught that some ones' specials eye. And all of your care dropped, and all of the world just stopped.\\" The song takes a interesting turn at the 3 minutes and 53 second mark when the synths once again kick in and the song gets a little more dancy. I think if the song jumps around a bit too much, and if it would have stayed more consistent or been shortened by a minute or two it would have made the song that much better.<br /><br />THE BEAT GOES ON is a much better version than the song that was leaked a few months ago. This is a groovy song that seems to have a Marvin gay feel to it. Kanye West makes a special rap cameo on this track and it surprisingly works really well. Madonna sings \\"You don't have the luxury of time you've got to say what's on your mind. Your head lost in the stars, you'll never go far it's time for you to read the signs.\\" This is another song I ended up enjoying even though it has a rap sequence in it.<br /><br />DANCE 2NIGHT is a mellow song with a funky 80's retro beat to it is which Madonna once again sings with Justin Timberlake. Madonna sings \\"You don't have to be beautiful to be understood. You don't have to be rich and famous to be good. You just gotta give more more more than you ever have before.\\" When the song reaches the 4 minute and 22 second mark it sounds like something off of Justin Timberlake's last album. Good song but something seems to be missing and it just seems to be a bit too bland for what we have come to expect from Madonna.<br /><br />SPANISH LESSON has a very urban tribal beat to it. To me this is the albums weakest song and my least favorite song on the album. The beat is very interesting to say the least but the silly lyrics and the beat just don't seem to do it for me. Madonna sings \\"If you do your homework maybe I will give you more. When you do your homework get up on the dance floor.\\" I think this song takes away from the quality of the album, and wish there would have been a better song put in its place.<br /><br />THE DEVIL WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU is a song a lover who can fool everyone but their partner. The song has samples of thunderstorms and rain that add to the very dramatic beat of the song. Madonna sings \\"Waiting underneath the stars there's something you should know. The angels they surround my heart telling me to let you go.\\" This is a song that takes close listening to the lyrics to really appreciate this gem.  The song sounds very similar to Justin Timberlakes \\"Cry Me a River.\\"<br /><br />VOICES is a slow song about a person who seems to enjoy playing with others emotions. Very nice beat with Madonna singing in a monotone sort of voice. Madonna sings \\"First you say you love me. Then you wanna leave me. Then you say you're sorry you play the game so well. I bought your illusion you're the greatest salesman. How could I refuse you when you sold it to yourself?\\" To me this is one of the weaker songs on the album and one of my least favorites.<br /><br />The album is very good, but it is no Ray of Light. By no means is this a bad album, but she has had better ones. After listening to it just seems like Madonna's voice is all over the place. I know the girl can sing, (think Ray of Light, Express Yourself, You'll See) but it seems like here her voice is not showcased to the best of its abilities, and comes across at times as very teeny bopper and a just plain weak. I love Madonna and really wanted to give the album five stars, but in all fairness she has done better albums and I expected more from her. I will say it's hard to believe Madonna has been with us forever changing and evolving for over 25 years. Very few artists have had the staying power this woman has had. It is nice to see someone who has not become a victim of celebrity, but a true survivor who leads a clean life and is one heck of a business woman. Even as she approaches 50 she still teaches us all that it's never too late to become a better version of yourself!!!ing to say the least but the silly lyrics and the beat just don't seem to do it for me.

B000V1Y43W|5.0|This is one of those Pixar flicks that does a better job of character development than 90 percent of the real-people films being released today.  Bugs' Life comes to mind as another positive example. It's a Disney production that even an adult can watch over and over.  I've gotten into it enough that I'm urging my family to consider a vacation out west driving Route 66.<br /><br />They said that when talkies replaced silent films, several years went by before they recovered from showcasing non-stop voice chatter and got back to real artistry in film making.  It's ironic that in this day when production houses (and audiences) can't seem to get past the gee-whiz of special effects, we need a pure animated piece to take us back to the real human-quality magic that movies can deliver.<br /><br />And then there's the Blu-ray video quality.  Holy crap!  This thing is knock-your-socks-off.  Animated films have an advantage in that everything can be simultaneously in focus.  Shadowy details can have a little contrast and sharpness added, and so-on.  The sound effects can be optimally synthesized for 5 channels.  There are simply fewer compromises.  The result is that in 1080p on an 11.5 foot screen, this is as good as I've seen, period.<br /><br />A movie about talking cars sounds dopey.  You may fear schmaltzy sentiment.  Expect to have exactly the opposite reaction.  Get it and get it now!<br />Tim Naff

B000002GJH|5.0|In Seattle, the grunge movement had already gone underway a few years before it was made a national phenomemnon in the early nineties. These earlier years of the Seattle scene were alot less produced, and alot more underground sounding. Also, they scream in a lot of ways about flipping off the establishment and embracing the demons and not to mention, are excellent records. Many names on the scene at this time went on to bigger and better successes once the ball got rolling, but one of the big names in Seattle before the grunge boom was a band called Mother Love Bone. Their ride was cut short when lead singer met an all to common demise in '91.<br />When the scene boomed, it was apparent to many that a tribute needed to be payed to the man, and his contributions to the scene in general. The remaining members of the band put this one together, with a few of their friends from Soundgarden, and an up and comer at the time, Eddie Vedder.<br />I'm sure many have heard the song HUNGER STRIKE on the radio, as it still continues to get frequent radio play, but the rest of this album is an absolute classic, with song for song being a collection of hidden gems.<br />The album is a good line between the early grunge scene and the scene that became a huge commercial success. I recommend this to anyone who is new to bands like Soundgarden and Pearl Jam etc. and I also recommend going back a ways to bands like Mother Love Bone and any of the above bands albums before 1991. You will notice that a lot of them are a lot more free spirited, and I always see this album as one that ushered in some darker days... but thats what made grunge popular in the first place, no?  A must have for alternative and grunge fans... Temple of The Dog.
7799623519|3.0|Just a friendly warning-For those of you who, like me, have listened to this album a million times, it's quite jarring when Empty spaces abruptly ends...This Chinese import is otherwise a beautiful set, but I guess in China, YOUNG LUST in just unacceptable-I just can't help think that considering that the song content itself is not all that offensive-the title term is never actually sung-someone could have instead just translated the title to something like \\"Young Groupie\\".....

B00NN78PKY|4.0|In 2006 Barack Obama reflected in print about contemporary America. He issued THE AUDACITY OF HOPE: THOUGHTS ON RECLAIMING THE AMERICAN DREAM.    For every person who reads this well crafted book from cover to cover there may be hundreds who do no more than dip into at random or scan the table of contents for one or two chapters to select. It is for the many not the few that I offer this little review.    There are four portions that are musts for any reader:    -- (1) The book's DEDICATION:      --To \\"MY MATERNAL GRANDMOTHER, TUTU,  who's been a rock of stability throughout my life,  and  MY MOTHER,  whose loving spirit sustains me still.\\"    -- (2) The PROLOGUE.    -- (3) CHAPTER THREE: Our Constitution    -- (4) CHAPTER SIX: Faith.    If these four segments do not attract you, I suspect that you will not go on to the other seven chapters on Republicans and Democrats, Values, Politics, Opportunity, Race, The World Beyond Our Borders, Family and the volume's Epilogue and Acknowledgments.    -- (1) The DEDICATION. In the spring of 2008 Senator and Presidential candidate Barack Hussein Obama is 46 years old. In 1995's DREAMS FROM MY FATHER, 34-year old \\"Barry\\" (so named through high school by everyone or shortened to \\"Bar\\" by his Kansan grandfather), Obama highlighted his life from birth in Hawaii in 1961 to his first visit at age 25 to Kenya, birthplace of his by then deceased father. His American ancestry was 100% white and the three persons who nurtured him longest and knew him best were his mother and her parents. Readers of DREAMS FROM MY FATHER are left in no doubt of his affectionate indebtedness to those \\"big three\\" Americans who brought him up.    -- (2) The PROLOGUE. Here Barack Obama lays out what THE AUDACITY OF HOPE will provide a reader. Some background: in October 1992, aged 31, Obama married fellow Chicago lawyer Michelle Robinson. They now have two young daughters, Malia Ann and Natasha. In 1995 Obama made his first successful run for the Illinois Senate. He was re-elected in 1998 and 2002. In November 2004 he was elected to the U.S. Senate.     We learn in the PROLOGUE that THE AUDACITY OF HOPE flows directly from his U.S. Senate race: the recurring bread and butter concerns he heard expressed over and over as he campaigned across Illinois (p.8). Obama says that he runs for elective office to honor a specific tradition in American politics, one \\"based on the simple idea that we have a stake in one another, and that what binds us together is greater than what drives us apart\\" (2).    Obama, was not yet a Presidential candidate when this, his second book, was being written. He asserts: \\"we need a new kind of politics, one that can excavate and build upon those shared understandings that pull us together as Americans\\"(9). The remainder of this well written book invites readers to join Senator Obama in a kind of archeological dig, an \\"excavation\\" into the history of America's values. Some values, some unifying forces are dimmed, buried, all but forgotten. The junior senator from Illinois invites readers to rediscover those values with him and to apply them to today's needs.    -- (3) CHAPTER THREE: Our Constitution. \\"For ten years before coming to Washington, I taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago\\"  (84). Obama faced students who thought they knew the Constitution without having read it. Despite whatever ways thoughtful Americans differently interpret that venerable document, all share a sense  of the fundamental personal rights enshrined in it (86). How can Americans hold together in practice a government proclaiming almost anarchic personal liberty? How can we cling in practice to our constitution when some legislature or some court makes a law or a decision with whose outcome we passionately disagree? (88).    The Senator empathizes with Justice Scalia's opinion that the original understanding of the founders must be followed. But in the end he comes down behind Justice Breyer: the constitution \\"is not a static, but rather a living document and must be read in the context of an ever-changing world\\" (90). Our democracy, metaphorically, is not a house to be built, but a conversation to be had (92). The Constitution gives us a \\"road map by which we marry passion to reason, the ideal of individual freedom to the demands of community\\" (95). A good part of this chapter goes to details of Senate practice and especially its not yet forgotten partisan debate over filibustering.    -- (4) CHAPTER SIX: Faith. Here are some excerpts and parphrases. \\"I was not raised in a religious household\\" (202). His mother regaled young Obama with tales of hypocritical preachers and self-righteous church women met in her growing up years in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas (203). But she also provided through books on family book shelves a working knowledge of world religions. To her, \\"Religion was an expression of human culture, not its well-spring (204). In Chicago as a community organizer, Obama realized that he needed to belong to a community of faith (206). He chose the African American religious tradition, with its power \\"to spur social change\\" (207). \\"Out of necessity, the black church had to minister to the whole person.\\" For American blacks salvation had to be both individual and collective. \\"I was able to see faith as more than just a comfort to the weary or a hedge against death\\" (208).    In politics liberals and Democrats must not abandon God and religion to the far right (214). They must find ways to pitch policy arguments in language powerful for both religious and non-religious Americans (216). It took Baptists and evangelicals to mobilize earliest pre-ratification support for the Bill of Rights (217). Religion must not be driven from the public forum. But our democracy demands \\"that the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal, rather than religion-specific, values. It requires that their proposals must be subject to argument and amenable to reason(219).    The other chapters of THE AUDACITY contain passages as good, but none better. If these snippets do not make you want to read more, nothing will. -OOO-
B0013FFMOK|5.0|If you are the sort that cries at movies, better have a fresh box of tissues before you start this one. It's a heart-wrencher, a gut-wrencher (yes, there's blood and violence), and ultimately one to make you think.  Think hard. Robert Neville (Will Smith) really does save the human race, but probably not the way you thought when you saw the previews. Don't let anyone tell you too much about this one: it's worth all the startle responses, shocks and emotional kicks in the gut.
B000VSBX34|3.0|In spite of being in the right place at the right time, Richard Lester never was (and still isn't, I suppose) all that great of a director.  He has ruined many a possibly good film with cornball theatrics.<br /><br />While it is extremely important culturally (and a far superior film than HELP!), I'm not much of an avid fan of A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, either (the Beatles movies don't really get good until MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR - yes, that one is flawed too, but it's still a fascinating, psychedelic home movie).  When Lester just allows the Beatles to be the Beatles in both films, they are pretty sublime.  When he actually makes them do stuff, they come off as really stilted.  The best moment in HELP! comes early, when the Beatles are just hanging out in their one-room/four-bed flat, or later when they are hanging out in Buckingham Palace, somewhat sordidly talking about chopping Ringo's finger off.<br /><br />In contrast with these fleeting moments, the cheap parody of James Bond action and iconography that comprises the rest of the film is joylessly uninspired.  To see the Beatles at the mercy of a half-baked romp just feels like a massively wasted opportunity.  The great cast (especially Eleanor Bron) is similarly stranded with little to do.  The Monkees did a much better job with this kind of mediocre material.<br /><br />After having seen the film on this recently restored dvd (and the film does look great, especially all the musical numbers, which make viewing/owning the dvd worthwhile), I was struck by the near-paranoid anti-Indian xenophobia of the film.  This is only months before George Harrison began embracing Indian music and philosophy; of the four bandmates, I imagine he hated this film most of all.
0671646788|5.0|The Magic Of Thinking Big is coming up on its 50 year anniversary, but the wisdom in its pages resonates timelessly.  A lot of what is contained in this book is what some would call common sense.  If you were blessed with an environment that treated this information as common sense, you are lucky.  For the rest of us that read this material, we will have our thinking altered drastically.  I have become aware of a gap between what is taught in textbooks and a lot of what one experiences in \\"the real world.\\"  That information is contained in this book.  In school attitude is often touted, but seldom taught. In fact, my first thought after finishing this was \\"why is this stuff not taught in schools?\\" I know of no other book that will ease the transition from awkward adolescence to the dog-eat-dog world of adulthood better than The Magic Of Thinking Big. Oh, what could have been if I'd been handed this book when I was 12 or 13.  You may have to adapt some of the dated examples and tips on dress to your situation, but by and large these principles will help you live a better life.  I recommend this book to anyone who is sick of the status quo, wants to move up the corporate ladder, or just wants some understanding in how the world works.  One of the most helpful books I have ever read, period.<br /><br />Also, a lot of people have contrasted this book to Dale Carnegie's How To Win Friends...  For what it's worth, I feel that each book has its place and that different personalities will relate to one book better than the other.  For my part, I found Magic Of Thinking Big more helpful and easier to read than Carnegie's book.  That's not to demean How To Win Friends... because I know people who have been drastically changed by that book, too.  Both books have proven helpful to many people.  That doesn't mean that one is better or worse than the other, they're just like vanilla and chocolate ice cream; two different flavors of the same stuff.
B0013FXWU6|2.0|This is not a movie, it is a compilation of scenes that in most cases, have nothing to do with each other.  There is no story here.  I kept waiting for some semblance of a plot but it never came.  My 2-star rating is due to the beautiful cinematography, but that's it. Lousy soundtrack sounds like fingernails on the chalkboard. And the last scene?  I give up.  No clue!!
0446402389|4.0|I generally don't care for serial killer stories, I find that everyday \\"regular\\" crime holds plenty of drama and is much easier to connect with. However, the Soviet setting of this debut thriller intrigued me enough to dip into it for a few pages, and the writing on those first few pages swept me into the story very quickly. For the first 3/4, it's an excellent grafting of the serial killer genre onto the everyday horror of the early-'50s Stalinist era Soviet Union. Unfortunately, Smith succumbs to the thriller writer's temptation of having a huge plot twist toward the end, which unnecessarily sabotages what had been a grim and realistic story to that point. It's one of those twists that comes out of nowhere, and really doesn't serve much purpose other than as a \\"gotcha\\" moment -- the story could have worked just as effectively without it.<br /><br />Other than this one vastly annoying flaw, the book is excellent. After a chilling prologue in the famine-devastated Ukraine of the 1930s (a famine engineered by Stalin, it must be noted), the story opens in 1953 Moscow, where we meet Great Patriotic War hero and militia officer Leo Demidov, as he pursues the interests of the state in tracking down its enemies. Smith takes plenty of time to build up the totalitarian setting, where fear and paranoia reigned, and reason was a luxury unavailable to the state. If you were a suspect, you were guilty, since the state did not make mistakes. The story focuses on Demidov, showing the privileges his family enjoys due to his position, and the precariousness of his position as a jealous underling plots to destroy him. (This underling is the weakest element in the book, as his hatred for Demidov is a critical catalyst several times in the story, but the motivation for it is far too one-dimensional.)<br /><br />It isn't until 1/3 of the way into the book that the serial killer plotline starts to assert itself, and Leo begins to realize that the same killer might have struck hundreds of miles apart. It's also at this point that I realized that Smith was taking the case of the real-life Soviet serial killer Andrei Chikatilo (aka \\"The Rostov Ripper\\") and moving it back in time a few decades. The killer's background, physical details, MO, and more are all based on the Chikatilo case. (I find it a little bit odd that while the \\"further reading\\" section at the end of the book makes a passing mention to a book on the Chikatilo case, Smith doesn't explain who Chikatilo was or just how directly he drew upon the case for the book. There have been several non-fiction books written about the case (such as [[ASIN:0060177179 Hunting the Devil]]), and two mediocre films based on it: [[ASIN:0783116934 Citizen X]] and [[ASIN:B000CR7R7U Evilenko]].) In any event, once Leo starts to suspect the existence of such a killer, he is severely hamstrung in his ability to do anything about it -- partly because the existence of such a madman is incompatible with the utopian ideals of the Soviet state. To admit such a killer would be to admit the imperfection of the state.<br /><br />As Leo's star falls, he is also subject to a shock in his personal life which makes him question everything. Galvanized to find and kill the serial killer as an act of redemption, he manages to enlist some help even as he comes under further pressure from his nemesis. A classic trope of the thriller is that the hunter/truth-seeker becomes the hunted, and Smith pulls just such a maneuver off brilliantly. The book picks up momentum, and other than the unnecessary plot twist mentioned above, races toward the climactic showdown with great skill. It's an excellent debut novel, and should have wide appeal to fans of thrillers, the serial killer subgenre, and fans of Martin Cruz Smith.It's also at this point that I realized that Smith was taking the case of the real-life Soviet serial killer Andrei Chikatilo (aka \\"The Rostov Ripper\\") and moving it back in time a few decades.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|I think in order to understand this movie, you have to have some semblance of intelligence.  It's not for your \\"average joe\\", blue collar, working class kind of person.  But if you have what it takes to watch and get this movie, it is one awesome movie.  I love movies that make you feel, make you think, and this is definitely one of those movies.  Like someone else mentioned, it's not about addiction per sea.  It's about hope and dreams and how easily they are lost.  It's about life and how it can sneak up on you and destroy all that you thought you were.  It's about how easy we can get lost and how those around us don't even see it happening until it's too late.  If you want a mindless, dumb movie, don't watch this.  However, if you want a movie that will make you think, make you feel; a movie that will stay with you even after you are done watching it - then this is the movie for you.
B000059GEI|2.0|Where do I begin?  First of all the story line was weak.  The movie seemed to drag on forever.  I breathed a heavy sigh of relief when it was finally over.  Seriously, how many different versions of Alexander's Ragtime Band can a person listen to in a single movie and not go insane?    Now for the good parts.  The costumes were gorgeous.  The dancers were very talented.  They made complicated steps appear effortless.      Overall, the movie was over the top during the musical numbers and weak during the non musical scenes.  The contrast was almost too much to bear.  There are many other musicals that balance the two, but not this one.
B00180R06I|5.0|The rat-toothed Nosferatu and the charming Transylvanian Count are the best known examples of early vampire movies, mostly because there weren't very many others at the time.<br /><br />But more often than not, \\"Vampyr\\" gets passed over when you talk about early vampire movies -- and that's a shame. Carl Th. Dreyer's masterpiece (loosely based on the works of J. Sheridan Le Fanu) is a straightforward little story wrapped in a hazy cocoon of dreamlike imagery and haunting direction. From the very beginning, this movie clings to you like a spiderweb.<br /><br />Occult student Allan Gray is staying at a hotel in the French countryside. But after being woken by a strange old man's cryptic warning, he finds that the inn is swarming with eerie supernatural happenings, including shadows that move independently. After he departs, a strange old man lets an ancient crone out of a closet.<br /><br />And when Allan arrives at a nearby chateau, he finds that the owner has been murdered, and his daughter Leone is suffering from mysterious wounds. After the girl is rescued from a strange old crone, she begins acting predatory toward her sister Gisele -- and the weird old doctor says that only a transfusion will save her. But the doctor is in league with the vampire -- and is working to destroy Leone...<br /><br />\\"Vampyr\\" has a pretty simple storyline, loosely based on a couple of J. Sheridan Le Fanu's short stories (including the classic \\"Carmilla\\"). But it's not the plot that makes this movie a classic -- it's the powerful, ghostly visuals that permeate it. And the beautiful real-life settings (the inn, chateau and church) don't hurt the  atmosphere of it all.<br /><br />In many ways, \\"Vampyr\\" is like a silent movie -- the characters are quiet, text cards intersperse the scenes, and several minutes are taken up by printed text from the \\"History of Vampires\\" book. In addition to this, the visuals are so powerful that it's almost a shock when one of the characters actually speaks out loud. Even then, nobody says anything unless it's actually necessary.<br /><br />Dreyer films this movie as if it were a choreographed dream, letting the camera drift through ornate rooms and hazy hills. And he often fixed on striking images -- pale feverish faces, still windvanes, cloudy skies, scythes, and the movement of shadows on walls and the ground. And there are some spectacularly creepy moments, such as when Leone starts baring her teeth gleefully at Gisele, or Allan watching the view from inside a coffin.<br /><br />And he steeps the entire movie in dreamlike effects -- hazy countrysides, skeletons, floating girls, and shadows that can dance and move independently. These strange effects are done almost effortlessly, adding to the feeling that you're surrounded by the unreal. Dreyer even puts a note of humor in from time to time, such as the dancing shadows with their little folk band.<br /><br />Julian West (aka Nicolas de Gunzburg) does a pretty solid job as our unflappable hero, although I question how his suit remains pristine all through the movie -- and he does a glorious job in that bizarre dream sequence. Sybille Schmitz has a small part, but is wonderfully feral as she starts to turn vampiric, and Henriette G&eacute;rard is unspeakably creepy as the ancient, stone-faced vampire who wants other people to suffer as well.<br /><br />Criterion is apparently giving \\"Vampyr\\" the treatment it sorely needs, cleaning up the prints in an effort to restore the clarity. It's also got new subtitles, loads of information about Dreyer, his filmmaking and the creation of \\"Vampyr,\\" articles about it, the screenplay and one of Le Fanu's short stories. Nice to see this underrated little movie is getting the attention is deserves.<br /><br />Carl Th.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Wow, what a workout and in only 20 minutes. I have been a member of Jillian's website for 4 months and have been doing the circuit exercises she has for me everyday. This dvd just blew those out of the water. I thought they were challenging. Woe, is all I can say. I love this dvd and look forward to doing the exercises with the knowledge, that I will get ripped in no time at all. Jillian rocks and is such a motivator. If you are looking for a fast, hard workout, that works all the muscle groups, then this dvd is a must for you.
B0013FXWU6|3.0|All this hype and for what? Well, I suspect that the majority of very high ratings are from people who felt compelled to be PC about the film mainly because it won awards and they allowed that to influence their sentiments. The only intriguing thing about the film was Daniel Day-Lewis' \\"John Huston acting style.\\" (Perhaps this was the comic element of the film?) On the other hand Paul Dano should be given more credit for his performance than I believe he has been. Thank goodness for the fast forward button on my player.
0061245097|5.0|I have been anxiously awaiting the release of One Foot in the Grave since the moment I finished the first book in the Night Huntress Series --Halfway to the Grave -- in October. My hope was that the sequel (One Foot in the Grave) would be every bit as good as the original. Guess what? It's even better!<br /><br />The witty sarcastic tone of the first book (along with Cat's hilarious inner banter) is even more honed than before. This book retains the perfect balance of romance, suspense, action, and humor that made book one such a joy to read (and re-read.) The humor is funnier, the romance is sexier, the action is more edgy, and --as unbelievable as it seems-- Bones is even hotter. I would be lying if I said I wasn't grinning like an idiot throughout much of my marathon read today.<br /><br />The main characters have evolved without changing the core of who they are. I was pleased at the presence nods to some of the characters from book one, and there were new characters that quickly become important to the reader, (which I hope to see again in book 3, At Grave's End)<br /><br />All in all, it was everything I hoped it would be, and more. There is no doubt that Jeaniene Frost is comfortably finding her place amongst the most talented authors in the genre, and I expect to see many more great things from her.<br /><br />Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll just order takeout for dinner and curl up for a reread of my new favorite book.
B0016HNOXQ|4.0|Long vanished from the music scene, Portishead have finally reemerged with a new album. Hallelujah for that.<br /><br />But this isn't quite the same Portishead as before -- the music here is more raw, minimalistic and dark, with a ragged murky edge that replaces some of the trippiness. While its flavour is quite different from Portishead's earlier work (and this album is best heard with as few comparisons as possible) the beautifully bittersweet \\"Third\\" is a haunting experience on its own.<br /><br />First, a man recites the Wiccan rule of three... in Portuguese. Not sure what that has to do with anything, really.<br /><br />It's followed up by \\"Silence,\\" a darkly vibrant mass of violins, urgent drumming and dark ripples of synth. But then it slows suddenly, and Beth Gibbons sings in a soft, fragile voice, \\"Tempted in our minds/Tormented inside lie/Wounded and afraid/Inside my head...\\" She adds in a wispy, plaintive voice, \\"Did you know when you lost?/Did you know when I wanted/Did you know when I lost...?\\"<br /><br />By this point, you should have a pretty good idea what you'll think of \\"Third.\\" Whether you love it or you hate it, you'll know.<br /><br />The dark, fragile sound of that first song carries over into the fairylike \\"Hunter\\" with its growling guitars, and the songs that follow -- tense elusive pop laments, organ ballads riddled with weird flapping and echoing synth noises, satiny rattly piano-synth melodies, and even a light little acoustic song that sounds mildly out of place, but makes a nice little lightweight oasis in all the dark stuff. The album rounds out with \\"Threads'\\" bleak web of windy synth, crashing drums and eerie guitar.<br /><br />The song that really doesn't fit in here is ironically the first single, the rather repetitive, jarring drum-a-thon that is \\"Machine Gun.\\" Sorry, but even Beth's haunting vocals cannot make this spiky song work.<br /><br />I'm not surprised that people thought that Portishead had broken up -- after all, it's been eleven years since their self-titled album came out. And in that time, many a musical trend has come and gone (including electronic ones) and most trip-hop bands have settled into other sounds -- usually acoustic or dancepop. Well, Portishead doesn't do anything so predictable -- in fact, the result is utterly UNpredictable.<br /><br />That trademark noir sound is gone. Completely gone. Instead we have a bleak, post-apocalyptic-dream sound, full of darker, tattered instrumentation, strange sounds and dark stretches of blipping/sweeping synth running just underneath. And yet if you listen to it without the comparisons of their previous albums, it turns out to be very compelling.<br /><br />There are some lighter moments, like the acoustic ballad \\"Deep Water,\\" but these softer interludes are overshadowed: we've got generous servings of growling grimy guitars and softer cycling ones, drum machines, sweeps of delicate piano and strings, and solemn soaring organ. But sadly, no horns. Seriously, where are the horns?<br /><br />Beth Gibbons' voice sounds incredibly pretty and fragile, like a piece of silk just about to tear. Pretty perfectly suited to songs tinged with sorrow (\\"Somehow turn me around/No matter how far I drift/Deep waters won't scare me tonight\\"), even in their more positive moments (\\"Wild, white horses/They will take me away/And the tenderness I feel/Will send the dark underneath\\").<br /><br />Those expecting another \\"Dummy\\" are going to be deeply disappointed in \\"Third.\\" But take it for itself, and its bleak, eerie beauty will start to show.t.

B00004SCX6|4.0|Very quickly, I enjoyed \\"Baby One More Time\\" and parts of \\"In the Zone.\\" I think \\"Britney\\" was her best. I didn't much like \\"Blackout.\\"<br /><br />The record starts great with the catchy \\"Oops I Did It Again.\\" That is a nice opener. Another real high point is 'What U See Is What U Get.' That is not only a great song, but it carries the message to be happy with yourself and not worry so much about trying to please others. (They may not be worth it.) Another major high point is 'Can't Make You Love Me.' This song is catchy and has a hard rock edge to it.<br /><br />While her later record \\"Britney\\" showed stronger effort, this 2nd one is also great.
B00169XU8I|5.0|Here comes Madonna's latest effort, \\"Hard Candy\\". With the hit single \\"4 Minutes\\", and its trumpets, heavy beats and Justin Timberlake being everywhere, it's not very hard to imagine what this album is going to sound like. It would be pointless comparing it to anything Madonna's done before, since she is as diverse as always, but the album is very cohesive and consistent musically, and quite ingenious lyrically.<br />The opening track, \\"Candy Shop\\" is a minimalistic track with a killer bass line and very, very suggestive lyrics. It's reminiscent of Kylie Minogue's \\"Slow\\", but it's very Madonna - fun, sexy and a great album opener. Next comes \\"4 Minutes\\", the J.T. collaboration, and one of the strongest and club-friendliest songs on the album.<br />\\"Give It 2 Me\\" is a fun, dance song with a very fun instrumental and catchy chorus. \\"Heartbeat\\" is an ok song, but I consider it a filler. And then comes \\"Miles Away\\", the first ballad on a Madonna album since \\"Easy Ride\\" closed her 2003 effort American Life. It is a great, personal song which ranks among the best on the album. \\"She's Not Me\\" is also a great song, with hilarious lyrics, which unfortunately is over six minutes long, and therefore grows dull and loses its initial bite. This is the problem with most of the tracks on the album. Other great tracks include \\"Incredible\\" and the moody, atmospheric \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\".<br />\\"Hard Candy\\" is essentially Madonna proving (unnecessarily) she still is the Queen of Pop, as if we could ever forget. It's a fun, thought-out collection of songs that scream Madonna's still in the game. Not only that, she's the varsity coach!<br />This limited, special \\"Candy Box\\" edition of the album includes the CD, with two remixes of \\"4 Minutes\\", which are good, but less catchy than the original, a booklet and a pack of mint candies.
B000FC1AOI|1.0|I'm so confused right now about this book...!     When I first read this book, I thought it was wonderful! As soon as the movie came out, I went to watch it, and I also really enjoyed the movie. It was a real tear-jerker.  However, parts of the plot from \\"P.S. I Love You\\" were similar to a Thai movie I watched last night, titled \\"The Letter.\\" In this Thai movie, a woman from Chiang Mai falls in love with a man from Bangkok. The two fall in love and get married. However, their happiness is cut short when the husband suddenly dies of a brain tumor. Before the wife decides to move back to Chiang Mai, she receives a letter from her dead husband. As it turns out, her husband had written a series of letters to her before he died and arranged to have them sent to her after his death. The letters help her move on and she moves back to Chiang Mai and gives birth to their son.   Weird, huh? \\"The Letter\\" was released in June 2004, and it's a remake of a Korean film which was released in 1997. Could it be coincidence that the plots of \\"P.S. I Love You\\" and \\"The Letter\\" are so similar??
B000BNI95Y|5.0|Amazon's five stars cannot do justice to Bebe's Pafuera Telaranas, an album that deserves six stars.  I cannot listen to this album without it effecting me emotionally.  One song makes me want to cry and the next one makes we want to date her.  She rails against abuse.  She expressively describes making love and thinking about making love.  Bebe touches on subjects that few Spaniards would.  Themes like \\"thinking of you with my hand\\", \\"taking advantage of a stranger sleeping in the park to satisfy a curiosity for the taste of 'honey'\\" \\"the yearning of her vagina that can only be cured by his thing,\\" and so on.  Despite the fact that this work is explicit, its subject matter is handled as art and spoken as only a woman could speak it.  I highly recommend this album, but if you speak Spanish, I suggest not listening to it at work, as your mind will wander.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|The combination of both mystery and hype really intrigued me about Cloverfield before its release; I started seeing TV spots that hardly gave away anything and I saw posters of a headless statue of liberty all over New York City. I'm a huge fan of the TV show LOST, so when I heard the producer of this film was J.J. Abrams, (LOST's creator) I was immediately sold. I went to the theaters opening weekend with two of my friends (both who ironically have motion sickness) and from the moment the film started with the \\"Classified\\" screen, I was hooked.    From the moment things started going down in the city, I found it hard for my eyes to leave the screen and I was on the edge of my seat. What a thrilling experience! The FX of the monster was nearly flawess (in my opinion, if it looked phony or cheesy, this film would've failed. Period.) The \\"Alien-esque\\" spawns of the beast were also very well done (one of the characters meets a horrible fate due to one of them.) While my friends were a bit bothered by the shaky-cam, I wasn't annoyed in the slightest... it only added to the realism (like the Blair Witch Project, another movie I found to be creepy and unique.) I actually cared for the characters in this film and wanted them to make it out of this situation alive.    I read a LOT of negative reviews for this film on Amazon, to my surprise, but I guess it really is a love-it or hate-it film. I personally LOVED it and found it to be an exciting and different take on the over-done \\"monster invades the city\\" films. I felt as though I was in the movie, seeing everything through the eyes of the characters and the ending was perfect. Also, people are complaining about NO plot or not enough information given... um, yeah, that's sort of the point! We see only what the characters see which adds to the exciting mystery of it. It wouldn't make sense if a scientist appeared out of nowhere and explained everything about the monster (put clues together and build your own conclusion.)If you haven't seen this yet, ignore all the hate and give it a try (with an open mind--and in a dark room with the volume cranked up.) Highly recommended.
0452289963|5.0|I first encountered Eckhart Tolle's philosphy some decades ago when I read with great interest his famed book, \\"The Power of Now.\\"  In his \\"A New Earth\\" he brings us further along the path of understanding the manner in which we can best live our lives - in the now.  Now, with those decades behind me, I find in this book even more pertinent advice for the living of my life in a fully realized and productive manner.  It was of interest to me as well that Eckhart Tolle has not lost contact with his universal knowledge and respect for the wisdom of world religions, philosophers, and writers which we have inherited.

B0015D3Z4O|5.0|The people that are giving this cd one star probably havent even listened to her new cd, nor will they.  They're just Madonna haters, and like to express their opinion and be heard because their just so insecure about theirselves. OR really young and thoughtless kids.  Who cares what they think?  This cd is everything i've read about and more.  It will debut at number one, and I predict it will rate right up there with Ray of Light, as far as sales and one of her best.

B000URDEB0|4.0|\\"Dark Passion Play\\" (2007) is female-fronted symphonic metal band Nightwish's sixth full-length release, and first with new vocalist Anette Olzon. It builds on the epic, orchestrated style of \\"Once\\" (2004).<br /><br />Tuomas Holopainen, Nightwish's keyboard player, does the vast majority of the band's songwriting, and deserves more credit than anyone (including Tarja Turunen) for the band's success. He has written innumerable fantastic songs. On \\"Dark Passion Play\\", however, it seems like he and the band got carried away with the orchestration (which is quite good) and forgot to write good songs.<br /><br />Previous Nightwish releases were filled were filled with catchy melodies. Here, beyond \\"Amaranth\\" and one or two others, we really don't have that, and while Nightwish's musicianship continues to be top-notch, there are quite a few songs here that aren't particularly interesting.<br /><br />Olzon is a thoroughly competent singer, but sometimes her vocals don't work with Nightwish's style. However the switch to her is hardly the disaster some claim. Marko Hietala does more singing on this album, which is fine - his voice fits Nightwish's more aggressive songs well.<br /><br />Nightwish got a little too fancy here, and all in all, this album is solid but not great. This doesn't mean the good times are over - Nightwish has enough talent to get it together and turn it around. It begins with the songwriting.
B000N6TYLW|4.0|The seventh season of Gilmore Girls continues to follow the main themes, however it does not seem to have as much drive as the previous seasons.  There is not the anticipation of \\"what's going to happen next.\\"  It was obvious that the show was winding down and coming to its' conclussion.  The last episode leaves all of the main themes open to possibilities.  The writers don't seem to resolve anything, but instead lead you to believe how things will probably turn out.  I was not as impressed with this season as I had been with previous ones.

The only reason for the review title is that if you are enraptured with this piece and love this interpretation to dire obsession, well, there is possibly one better recording. Surprise, it's by the same pianist, Richter, and in the same year, 1959. Do a search for \\"Rachmaninov\\" and \\"Richter.\\" It's on the Yedang label, among others, and conducted by Kurt Sanderling.     Richter's interpretation is identical, not surprising given it's the same year. All you can do is play each version, one beside the other, and pick your favorite moments from each... a slight accent here, a clearer run there, it's a tossup. The other recording is less clear (live?) but has better bass response, which makes a difference. Sit back and marvel at the vast talent.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|This is a solid new disc from the fabulous Madonna.  A brief track by track review:    CANDY SHOP(8/10) Fun opener with lots a sexual overtones and entendre. Good song.    4 MINUTES (9/10)We all know it--whats to say    GIVE IT 2 ME (11/10) One of the four best songs on the disc (along with HEARTBEAT, MILES AWAY and SHE'S NOT ME).  Great dance music not a lot of thought required.  It's CONFESSIONS with and edge. Single #2 I believe.    HEARTBEAT (10/10) Great hook, great chorus.  I love this songs    MILES AWAY (11/10) Beautiful song. Very strong vocally.  I hope it is released as a single.    SHE'S NOT ME (10/10) a nice swipe at wannabe's veiled as a jilted lover song.  But she's not concerned--she knows she can do it better!    INCREDIBLE (8/10) Fun filler with hopeful lyrics about good sex.    BEAT GOES ON (6/10) The leaked version was much better.  This is very different than that version.  The first half is fine but it breaks down in the middle, punctuation by a horrid and irritating rap by Kanye West.    DANCE 2NIGHT - (9/10) another great dance song    SPANISH LESSONS(8/10) More fun filler.  Spanish phrases loosely translated into English    DEVIL WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU (8.5/10) Slower, funkier song--good lyrics    VOICES (9/10) Gotta love a Madonna song that starts \\"who is the master who is the slave)--solid dancey song    Overall a great album.  I five 9 out of 10 stars (BEAT GOES ON drops it from a 10 out of 10)
0765316978|2.0|I'm sure die-hard Scalzi fans will burn me at the stake for this and maybe I've just been spoiled by Old Man's War and the Ghost Brigades, but I have to say that I was dissatisfied with the final book in this series.    The banter between the characters, per the author's usual style, is entertaining but fails to compensate for an underdone, flimsy storyline. Add in an uneven pace, a linear supporting character here and there, and clumsy, forced sequence of events and out pops The Last Colony.    I think Mr. Scalzi was ready to move on to another project and pushed out the book simply to close out the trilogy. Simply put The Last Colony is an awkward, disappointing ending to an otherwise fantastic trilogy.
6305428557|5.0|I have actually also read the book, which tells you something about the impact this movie had upon me.  In it Monger points out one of the great ironies of the story- the man with the longest and most enigmatic nickname did not need one:  The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain was quite probably the only man named Anson living West of the Welsh border.  He wasn't named Williams, Evans, Jones or Morgan. That he had one was a mark of the respect and admiration that the townfolk had for the schoolmaster.  And understandably: In the course of the movie we see a high class Englisman fall in love with a place and a people, not just Betty From Cardiff.      This is a story of a miracle that these humble Welsh folk wrought for themselves: A miracle of love, courage and healing in the midst of awful war [OK, there's a wee bit of skullduggery as well]. It takes place towards the end of the First World War- at a time when the lives of ordinary people had been brutalized through the sheer shock of massive loss- scarcely a single family had not seen a husband, son or father die- and if not your own family then you had lost a friend to the war.    Hugh Grant's character, Anson, is himself a victim of shell shock or what we would now call PST. He has been reduced to a pale shadow.  But he wants to live again, if only he can find the courage.  To me this is the real theme of this movie- that to love takes courage, but you cannot really live unless you love.   That truth underpins the emotional climax of this movie: It is exemplified most of all in the character of Anson in that moment after the sun has gone down on the last possible day when the town's dream of officially restoring the status of their mountain can still be attained: The moment when Betty asks him to stay the night atop the mountain so that he can measure it in the early morning light before he has to leave.  She takes an extraordinary risk, putting her reputation permanently on the line by offering to stay the night with him to keep him company.  Of course, what she is really offering him is far more than merely a single night. And then we watch a miracle unfold as Anson finds the courage to fight past the trauma of war and his class prejudices to accept her offer of a lifetime of love. It is a truly moving, indeed tearjerking moment because we can actually already see that this is a decision that he will never, ever regret, no not even for an instant- no matter what his highbrow family might (no, make that absolutely will) think of his bride. It is a truly beautiful moment and Tara Fitzgerald and Hugh Grant were never better than at that moment in this movie- acting so good that we see the future of their characters unfolding before them.    As you can tell this is a favorite movie of mine. I watch it at least once a year.
0312117337|5.0|Zen and Nonduality:<br /><br />I can only talk about this deck as part of the spiritual genre known as nonduality, which speaks to the experience of oneness, especially with God or reality itself. Nonduality is the wisdom or deepest knowing of Zen, but not only Zen, also Sufism, Kabbalah, Advaita, Buddhism, Gnostic Christianity, quantum theory, and other fields.<br /><br />The nonduality  genre consists of teachers, students, scriptures, sacred structures and sites, rituals, practices, books, films, audio and video recordings, websites, blogs, emails, all the subjects they bear on, such as religion, philosophy, psychology, quantum physics, and the genre of nonduality also includes this deck of cards.<br /><br />The Book and The Deck:<br /><br />There are two parts to this deck. One is the deck. The other is the book that accompanies it. The book states very plainly how this deck differs from other tarot decks: \\"Osho Zen Tarot is definitely not a traditional tarot in the sense that you play with prediction. Rather it is a transcendental game of Zen which mirrors the moment, unwaveringly presenting what is here, now, without judgment or comparison.\\"<br /><br />The book itself describes the deck within the context of traditional tarot decks. The framework made up by the Major and Minor Arcana is explained. Recommendations are given for how to play the transcendental game of Zen, including card layouts and the frame of mind to keep.<br /><br />Then each card is pictured (in black and white) and the theme is described concisely and profoundly by means of an excerpt from the vast body of Osho's writings. As well, there is a brief commentary on the card itself, about the picture, the symbolism, the meaning, the application to your life.<br /><br />Freeze Frame the Now:<br /><br />Between the artistic card itself, the Osho reflection upon the theme, and the commentary, a moment of deep understanding and insight becomes possible. When that card is part of a layout of cards, then that understanding and insight becomes part of a bigger transcendental construction. The result is that the present, the moment, becomes crystallized so that you can examine it.<br /><br />If you want to crystallize the now, do a layout with these cards, and examine the crystal's angles, colors, points and planes. Become aware of how the universe creates you and act sensibly from that knowledge. That's what this tarot deck is about. I use it once in a while to turn the moment inside out. Mostly, it's fun.<br /><br />Jerry Katzanscendental construction. The result is that the present, the moment, becomes crystallized so that you can examine it.

B000000XB9|5.0|This c.d. captures the great sounds that is distinctively Creedence. Their version of \\"I heard it through the grapevine\\" is by far the best I have ever heard. Great song selections make this a c.d. you will never get tired of!
B000Q66HBE|3.0|If you didn't read my review for their other cd, I bought this one at the same time as Scream, Aim, Fire, based off of the title track single. The rest of that cd was disappointing. Each track dropped a little more to the emo sound. I heard that this one could not compare in aggressiveness to the newer one. Although it is not as heavy as the title track, this one is more consistent and heavier then the end of SAF. Both are listenable but I was expecting heavier.
B00026WU4G|5.0|The first time I heard music from INFIDELS was on Pandora Radio on the inernet. I don't remember them playing this music on local FM. The song EYE AND EYE appealed to me and is why I bought this CD. I used to think it was EYE FOR EYE, BUT I was wrong. Bob Dylan has a good mellow sound to him on this album and I could listen to it over and over.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I have been listening to this CD for weeks now in my car, I just love it.  It is one of the few CD's where I don't even need to skip tracks I just hit  shuffle and go.  This album, in my eyes anyway, really redeemed Linkin Park after LPJZ which was just awful (spare me the hate replies if you liked it, this is my opinion and a way to judge the album before you buy it).  This album is more melodic than Hybrid Theory, Reanimation, and LPJZ and is, as I said, a brilliant successor to Metora.  The songs are well written, well played, and well conceived and I am yet to meet a Metora lover who didn't like this album as well.  If you enjoy style of bands like Greenday, Blue October, My Chemical Romance, or AFI you will probably enjoy Minuets to Midnight.  The above in mind, it is almost impossible to accurately rate music and artwork so listen to it before ya buy it.  Theres my two cents, take it or leave it.
B000ICM5VW|5.0|This film makes Kong so lifelike you'd swear he was real. With scenes worthy and reminiscent of \\"Jurassic Park\\" and action similiar to an \\"Indiana Jones\\" movie wrapped up in amazing sets and costumes it's one you'll want to see more than once and share with your friends. The strange \\"love story\\" endures better than ever as the classic technology vs. nature theme unfolds. I'd rate this as a \\"must have\\" for the DVD library.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Wow!  I cannot express how great this CD is.  I've been a lifelong Madonna fan and each new Madonna music release is quite exciting.  I happen to love Madonna's voice either singing the ballads or the dance thumpers.  I want Madonna to have fun again and Hard Candy delivers it!    I love all the songs, especially 4 Minutes, The Beat Goes On, Miles Away, Dance 2Nite and She's Not Me.  I never doubted Madonna in working with Timbaland, Justin, and Pharrell.  It's great to see the younger generation wanting to work with a legend such as Madonna.  I know some fans were put off by her recruiting popular producers already but that's the sound she wanted.      This is a more than worthy follow-up to Confessions.  I haven't stopped listening to it since I've gotten it.  Madonna just makes me happy and this CD makes me love her even more.  Can't wait to see her perform some of the songs live!
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|This album is way different from her past albums of dance.  Fortunately older Madonna fans will appreciate the older retro 80's vibe this album has.  People who don't like change or reinventions in life are warned that this is still dancey but it has the R&B beat of dance.  I suggest for people to buy this album because it is different and another reinvention of the invisable Madonna!
B000AR9YQ4|5.0|Being a big fan of Basia, I learned about her beginnings with Matt Bianco.<br />Much in the same style as Basia, Matt Bianco is an enjoyable blend of; Salsa/Jazz/Swing/R & B and pure fun. A must have for Basia fans and those who enjoy upbeat happy MUSIC.
B000002RXS|5.0|I bought this on recommendation of a friend as I prepared to sing Carmen in a chorus, so I have listened to it perhaps 20 times.  I never get tired of Callas.  Some of the other reviewers said she was past her prime.  Maybe that's true for pure vocal quality, but her feel for the role is outstanding and, though this is just audio, you can see her sneer, watch her flirt, and chuckle with her intonation.  The chorus isn't great, but mine will be better.
B000UBMWG4|4.0|The first Blu-Ray I've purchased/seen. Much greater detail than NTSC or than I remeber as on the big screen at the movies.

B000VAPZM2|5.0|After watching High School Musical 2 on the Disney Channel,  my kids wanted to see it again and again.   I liked the character of the movie, it is refreshing to see a kid/teen oriented movie that doesn't promote illicit activities and unsavory lifestyles.    Kudos to Disney for remembering that kids need good, wholesome entertainment in this day and time and the music is great, too!    If you are looking to buy a teen/kid  friendly movie this is the one to buy.  It fun to watch and great for the whole family.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|Not since teaming with Dallas Austin and Babyface for 1994's \\"Bedtime Stories,\\" has Madonna's choice in collaborators been so deliberate. Then, she was trying to claw her way from the \\"Sex\\"-era backlash and, although a spotty effort, it did yield the biggest chart success of her career (\\"Take a Bow,\\" 7 weeks at #1). This time around today's hip-hop hitmakers, Timbaland, Justin Timberlake, Nate \\"Danja\\" Hills and Pharrell, helm her quest to regain relevance within an ageist industry (no other reason supports why \\"Hung Up,\\" which went on to sell over a million copies in the U.S., was all but ignored by radio).     The first exposure to this new urban sound came with \\"Hey You,\\" 2007's Pharrell venture for Live Earth which is arguably one of her worst singles ever produced for mass consumption. For a song meant to be inspirational, it was joyless. And, that was before she started rambling nonsense about \\"poets and prophets.\\" \\"Candy Shop\\" and \\"Beat Goes On,\\" both also with Pharrell, leaked shortly afterward fueling speculation from critics and fans alike that Madonna's next effort would be a banal misstep in line with her much-maligned rap on \\"American Life.\\"     \\"4 Minutes,\\" the lead single from \\"Hard Candy\\" and a duet with Justin Timberlake, did little to ease those fears. Madonna all but gets swallowed by the Timbaland/Timberlake/Danja production within a rush of horns and cowbells (and not much else). She doesn't even sing her own song's title! And yet, the strategy worked as \\"4 Minutes\\" is her highest chart peak (#3 thus far) in eight years breaking Elvis' record of the Most Top Ten Hits of any artist (37).     It was with trepidation then that I dimmed the lights, plugged my earbuds into my ipod, and opened this bag of sweets.     \\"Candy Shop,\\" identical to the leaked version, as an introduction to the album seems slightly less ridiculous though it is still hard to swallow such not-so-subtle innuendo as \\"I've got Turkish delight baby and so much more.\\" The \\"My sugaris raw/sticky and sweet\\" potential remains unrealized. It is a shame it was not reworked in the same vein as the almost unrecognizable and infinitely improved, \\"Beat Goes On.\\" With its \\"Get Down, Beep Beep\\" bounce, it along with \\"She's Not Me\\" and \\"Dance Tonight,\\" are more pure Disco than anything on \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" and return an element of fun to Madonna's vocals that has been absent lately. Clearly, Madonna still wants to dance.     In fact, a large portion of \\"Hard Candy\\" is about dancing itself, a long time theme in the Madonna lexicon but never in such quantity. \\"Heartbeat,\\" a true gem and return to dance-pop form, recalls \\"Into The Groove\\" with its \\"when I dance, I feel free\\" sentiment while \\"Give It 2 Me,\\" the catchy second single, picks up where \\"Over and Over\\" left off with her boasting I can go on and on and on (though the dated \\"Get Stupid\\" breakdown is way too forced).     With an album so hell-bent on getting us up off of our feet, it is the softer confections that showcase some of her best work (if not give fuel to the tabloid fodder). \\"Miles Away\\" is a perfect summer jam with its \\"you always have the biggest heart when we're six thousand miles apart\\" lament on long distance love. The gorgeous \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You,\\" a song that has been talked about for years, gets a \\"Cry Me A River\\"-esque update and contains her most clever lyrics since the Patrick Leonard days. And, \\"Voices\\" is another melancholic exposition on a troubled relationship: Treat me like a curse then tell me I'm your savior.     As with any box of candy though, there are always a few sour pieces: \\"Incredible,\\" a mini opera of sorts about fighting to rekindle that initial spark, begins pretty enough but ultimately suffers from over-production. While the cutesy, nasal delivery on the literal \\"Spanish Lesson\\" harkens on Nikki Finn annoyance.     Madonna has once again emerged from another \\"Re-Invention\\" remaining true to herself. With a career that has thrived on being under-estimated, should there ever have been any real doubt? \\"Hard Candy\\" fulfills any sweet tooth craving and, as the boxing theme to the album cover suggests, Madonna is not about to go anywhere without a fight.

B000JJS8TM|5.0|Once again, for the umpteenth time, Sir George Martin shows us what can be done with the melding of what was recorded on a few analog tracks, a few well placed microphones, and merging it with todays technology.  You will not beleive what you hear.  Overlain tracks, of different songs, but somehow it makes perfect sense.  Segues from one track to another, seamless joinery, what a treat to hear!  And best of all, very little over-doing it in the digital processing world.  All the digital editing and processing seems as though it belonged there the first time the recordings were done, 40 years ago.  ...Might have something to do with someone who *was* there having freedom to do this effort.<br /><br />Gorgeously mixed, huge, wide, deep sound stage, there's something new to be found at each and every time you listen to it.  Headphones might reveal some little background aberations from some of the original material now and again, but so what, it's original.  This is a must have for any life-long Beatles fan.<br /><br />Just buy it.
0800141660|4.0|I found this version of Sense & Sensibility to be OK. However, I think I prefer the Masterpiece Theater one better.  Though this had all the elements needed for the production, it just seemed a little watered down in comparison, like they were watching the budget and had to cut a few corners along the way. Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, Kate Winslet & Alan Rickman are all recognizable Hollywood names, but they seemed a bit wooden for my taste, especially Hugh Grant. He acted like he was fairly bored with the whole thing.... I am glad to have it for comparison, but I will probably not watch it often. (I had not seen the other version until after I purchased this one). If you like to buy films for the stars in them, then this is good choice for you. The story is still there, but the Masterpiece Theater version is a bit meatier!
1582701709|1.0|There are so many unbelievable and twisted things implied (and even said outright) in The Secret that I cannot understand why Oprah would fail to call Rhonda out like she did James Frey (I say this rhetorically, of course). People have already pointed out  the major problems...but there are loads of little things, too, that collectively destroy some of Byrne's claims. Take her quote of Winston Churchill saying: \\"You create your own universe as you go along\\" (p.36).<br /><br />This is laughable. Churchill did, indeed, say this. Only, he was quoting someone else--and mocking them, calling this claim \\"absurd\\"! In fact, in context, he was flat out mocking Byrne's claims altogether. How ironic is that? Either Byrne knowingly and deceitfully twisted his quote to serve her own purposes, or (more likely), actually didn't do any real research and took the already-misquoted quote from a new-agey flip calendar.<br /><br />Here is the actual context from Churchill's early autobiography (which you can find on Amazon, listed as Winston S. Churchill (1874-1965): My Early Life (Fontana, London, 1972, pp 123-124):<br /><br />\\"Some of my cousins who had the great advantage of University education used to tease me with arguments to prove that nothing has any existence except what we think of it. 'The whole creation is but a dream; all phenomena are imaginary. You create your own universe as you go along. The stronger your imagination, the more variegated your universe. When you leave off dreaming, the universe ceases to exist.' These amusing mental acrobatics are all right to play with. They are perfectly harmless and perfectly useless.

B000T05R8Q|2.0|Believe me, I have given this CD several chances to grow on me but I just can't get through it. I don't get it. But not because of ignorance, or lack of 'musical appreciation' as some reviewers who love this album suggest. I get the music, I just don't get all the praise. This album at least had the potential to sound great, and should have sounded great. But it doesn't. Recorded at Abbey Road Studios (called, EMI at the time), the same studio that produced the Beatles, the Hollies, the Zombies and other great artists of the day. A studio proven capable of great sounds! Yet what we get is an amateurish and sloppy first record. The recording levels waver all over the place. The bass looses the drum beat several times. Guitars, at times, are out of tune and distorted due to recording levels being too hot. The performances and arrangements are also amateurish. Definitely acid driven! Some claim it to be experimental, and that's what gives it it's charm. I beleive it to be an experiment 'gone awry'. Syd may have had the potential to be a great artist (no genius) but there are only a few signs here, IMHO. That's just my opinion hardcore fans, so pull back the firing squad. There is much more genius to be found in several artists first outings, but not here. These guys were still learning their craft. Some good ideas, for sure, but nowhere near genius (I do like `Lucifer Sam').

I don't know, I just feel sorry for anyone retarded enough to thing something this obviously false was true. The Da Vinci Code is an insult to my intellect.

0385338724|5.0|The world's reigning queen of frothy chick lit (translation: literature for women, girls, grandmothers, mothers, non-male creatures in general), Sophie Kinsella (author of the Confessions of a Shopaholic series and more) is back at it again with her seventh novel, a stand-alone titled \\"Remember Me\\" about a twenty-something London executive's bout with amnesia.  The plot centers around 28 year-old Deller Carpets employee Lexi Smart, previously a snaggly-toothed, frizzy haired, slightly overweight low-level employee who wakes up after a three-year car-crash-induced coma only to realize she's now a slim, sleek, polished spitfire who is dubbed \\"The Cobra\\" by her subordinates.  Not only that, she also has a gorgeous millionaire husband, a posh mansion in one of London's ritziest neighborhoods, and a whole plethora of glamorous, nouveau riche socialite friends!  What more could a girl ask for?  Only nothing is that easy for Lexi, as she realizes that her new life is not exactly what it's cut out to be, and that being rich, slim, gorgeous, and popular isn't everything (especially when all your friends turn their back on you and your nasty elitist new attitude).    The premise is interesting (albeit rather cliche, which is to be expected) with a hilarious execution; however at times the plot tends toward meandering, and the ending is a bit abrupt.  In general, it's a highly amusing, entertaining and quick read.  Perfect escapism for a lazy Sunday afternoon or a long plane ride.  Kinsella is the master of this sugary genre, and no one else in the field (including Marian Keyes, Bridget Fielding, Jennifer Weiner) can touch her when it comes to pure, unbridled, romantic comedy style hilarity.  Don't expect a \\"War and Peace\\" style experience with this book. If you enjoyed any of Kinsella's Shopaholic series, you're not going to walk away disappointed with Lexi's adventures.  Beware of the \\"Mont Blanc\\" chapter of the novel, as it will most likely have you gasping for breath after laughing like a hyena for half an hour.

B000Y7U98C|1.0|I rented this movie expecting a bigger-budget version of \\"Solar Crisis,\\" a cheesy and underappreciated Japanese vehicle for an aging Charlton Heston in which the sun is going out and has to be reignited by a nuclear bomb.  Sadly, \\"Solar Crisis\\" is much more entertaining.<br /><br />\\"Sunshine\\" starts off ponderous and self-important, rather than stately.  Early in the film, when the crew assembles around a dinner table for some Exposition, we know we're in trouble.  First, the crew is simply unbelievable; with the future of Earth at stake, no one would select these clowns to deliver the Earth-saving payload to the sun.  Second, the scene is a direct ripoff of the post-hypersleep dinner scene in \\"Alien.\\"  I didn't get that until my wife asked if this was a gory movie.  I replied that I didn't think so, but had the same feeling myself - until I realized where the scene came from.  Of course, in \\"Alien\\" the dinner scene is a masterpiece of economical characterization and exposition, half-improv'd by skilled actors, and in \\"Sunshine\\" the dinner scene is a trite, useless way to kill a few minutes.  And there's not even a chest burster!<br /><br />As \\"Sunshine\\" progresses, it's clear that the movie is 50% \\"Alien,\\" with about 25% \\"2001\\"--primarily evident in the ponderousness, but also in the slavish copying of the pod-to-airlock explosive transfer of astronauts through vacuum.  The remainder of the film is the aforementioned \\"Solar Crisis,\\" with a helping of \\"Solaris\\" (the 70s vintage Soviet one that dragged even worse that Clooney's) and \\"Event Horizon\\" thrown in.  \\"Sunshine\\" manages to make even \\"Event Horizon\\" look good in comparison.<br /><br />In the end, there is some undefined monster guy, who is baffling and pointless.  Is he human?  Is he an alien?  Is he supernatural?  Is he a hallucination?  I won't give you a spoiler, because I can't; we never find out, and you have to figure it out for yourself.  If you're still awake.<br /><br />(As a former spacecraft engineer, I will spare you the things about this movie that made my brain hurt, like why a spaceship built on a crash schedule has so, so much room for 8 people, why a spaceship with gravity control would never be built like \\"Icarus 2\\", and why it would actually take about the same time as a Caribbean cruise to get to the sun if humans had that technology.)<br /><br />On the plus side, the cinematography sure is pretty, and those with the Blu-Ray disc will obtain the full benefit of that.  But, similar to \\"The Fountain\\", if you plan to use this disc to show off the glory of Blu-Ray, turn off the sound and put on some music instead.  It's not like you'll miss any plot.<br /><br />Derivative, shoddy, boring and awful in every way, this is a film to avoid at all costs.  \\"Sunshine\\" is not even entertaining as a bad film.  Too bad, because Boyle is a fine director who has put together far better films than this.about this movie that made my brain hurt, like why a spaceship built on a crash schedule has so, so much room for 8 people, why a spaceship with gravity control would never be built like \\"Icarus 2\\", and why it would actually take about the same time as a Caribbean cruise to get to the sun if humans had that technology.)

B000FBJ9Z6|3.0|Darwin's _Origin of Species_ is a phenomenal work and was truly brilliant and insightful at the time. It's a classic of science and it's one of those books that everyone should read.    That said, this particular Kindle edition of the book is disappointing. Primarily, the text is fully-justified rather than normal left-aligned (right-ragged). (This means that spacing between words varies so that the last characters of each line end up being aligned along the righthand margin, and the first characters are still aligned along the left margin.) It's a well-known principle of typography that justified text is harder to read than ragged text -- the spacing between words is variable, so your eyes have to work harder to move over the text. I don't see why this edition would have made that choice.    If you want to read this excellent book, you might consider a different edition.
B0007939NO|5.0|I enjoyed this musical more than I ever imagined.  The backdrop is obviously painted, but after a few minutes one doesn't even notice it anymore.  The songs are charming and the dancing is lovely.  Especially the ballet with the two leads.  There are a lot of traditional Scottish elements in the story.  With the main theme of the story being a love story.  Overall it is delightful and one finishes the movie feeling like singing and dancing away!
0375424474|5.0|This book could serve as a great supplement to a high school or even college biology course. Despite the title, it focuses more broadly on comparative anatomy and explains where, how, and why much of our body developed the way it did. While some of the basic points I recalled from my high school biology days, they were never explained to me as clearly as Shubin is able to do. His writing makes years of evolutionary history and complex science accessible and fun to read, especially for someone (like me) who only has a short amount of time to read books for relaxation. He also seamlessly integrates various fields of biological science, from paleontology to DNA analysis, to explain his larger point. I only wish I had read this in high school, when I was still deciding which career path to chose.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I love this movie!  It's a little long for some people, but even my boyfriend liked it!  That's how good it is!
B000AP04NI|4.0|It is nice to see a musical set in the Wild West era.  The main thing that holds me back from considering this a worthy film is the message given to the one fellow to commit suicide.  The reasoning being that he will be remembered then.  It is all done very lightheartedly, but still that seems to be a rather peculiar message.  And one that keeps this from being a family film, I do believe.  Some of the other songs are rather enjoyable, however.
B000YXMMAE|4.0|My niece insisted that I fill in the gap in my music collection w/ some Radiohead.  I was going to get In Rainbows when it was free anyhow, but never got around to it.  This album is great!  Fits in well w/ with my New Order/REM/Fountains of Wayne taste.   Gotta say that I don't love O.K. Computer--I bought that one too after hearing good things.  It's too abrasive for me now--I think I would have loved it as a teenager, though.
B000RJO578|4.0|Very funny movie, if you can appreciate the British making fun of the Hollywood blockbuster macho cop-buddy genre. The premise is funny, the dialogue is funny, the characters are funny, and the action is funny.  You know the tired old cliche in those Hollywood cop movies, one of the cops is divorced, married to the job, and it's just so melodramatic-stupid.  Well in this spoof, the protagonist plays that part more like a gung-ho workoholic, the kind we're more likely to find in real life, which is much funnier.  You also know how thinly two dimensional and predictable the bad guys are in American mainstream cop movies, well the ridiculous twist here is that the bad guys are quaint English villager types, it's an absurd twist that had me grinning when I wasn't laughing out loud.  There's no serious message here, but if you like English humor, and action-comedy, this could be the best of 2007 for you.
B0017P7MOO|3.0|Great album.  I tend to love anything from this band.  One Day Like This and Grounds for Divorce are wonderful tunes.  The depth of sounds and lyrics makes Elbow stand out from the crowd.      But okay, over a couple of listens, I'm left with 2 thoughts.  1.  Does anyone think the mixing is a bit off?  It doesn't seem as a cohesive sound as pass albums.  The \\"symphony\\" sound is a great direction, but the levels, volumes, etc. are off.  For example, the horns in Starlings are too weird.   They don't fit.   2.  Most songs get \\"catchy.\\"  They start to bite and really grip me but then suddenly fall away.  Starlings is a good example of this.     Overall, if you like Elbow, don't be afraid to buy the whole album.  Enjoy.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|If you are concerned with how these short tracks amount to an album.... worry not. It is a fantastic cd. Much like the movie it amounts to way more than what you think. Eddie is fantastic. The packaging is brilliant as well. Absolutely worth the money. I put off buying it for a while and now I wish I hadn't waited so long.
B00008G8M4|1.0|This is a really stupid movie.  It's not original in any way, a bad montage of tired science fiction and action comedy cliches that make the movie both highly predictable and completely unexciting.  The epitome of special effects without sensible plot.  Even the talented actors in here go to waste with foolish lines, impossible physics, over the top action sequences, the movie is just bad in every way possible.  It's interesting how the high minded science fiction with the cheesy special effects in the 1960s (Star Trek envisioned a future where we somehow cured poverty and racism), and the feel-good triumph of good over evil (Star Wars made us all cheer) of the 70's, gave way to the explosions for the short attention span audiences at the close of the 20th Century.  To enjoy any science fiction movie, you have to buy into the fictional science of the movie, it has to seem realistic.  Well that wasn't too hard in Alien, because we can all relate to being scared of something we don't really know or understand.  Here's a typical problem in Independence Day.  You ever rent a car, and find you can't just pull out of the airport parking lot because you can't figure out how the unfamiliar car starts up, gets into gear, where the headlights are, the wipers, the seat controls?  And yet, in this movie, you can apparently hop right into an alien flying vehicle and not just take for a spin, but save the planet.  The only time I saw this horrendous movie, I saw the \\"I sure picked the wrong day to give up drinking\\" line coming from a mile off, and the fact that the script writers would try to pull this off years AFTER \\"Airplane,\\" well it really makes it clear that Hollywood doesn't think very highly of the typical American moviegoer.
B0000A118M|5.0|John Coltrane-A Love Supreme *****<br /><br />Being a massive Miles Davis fan but not owning much jazz other than Davis, Coltrane came highly recommended, especially A Love Supreme. So I finally broke down and bought it, and my only gripe is with myself, that I didn't buy this masterpiece sooner! Upon hearing the title I assumed it was a spiritual album of sorts, and I was correct. The album symbolizes Coltrane's search for music, spiritual, and cultural freedom. Though I'm not sure he live long enough to see all those things go into effect, I am pretty sure he did gain his musical freedom.<br /><br />A Love Supreme plays out like a suite of hope, redemption, and remorse. The power of McCoy Tyners piano through out adds elements of life to a bleak bass line like that of Jimmy Garrison (and by bleak I mean melancholy). Coltrane's tenor saxophone is chilling at times, especially during the droning 'Psalm' which closes the album. But what makes this album especially memorable for me is Elvin Jones. His playing through out the album is phenomenal. Some of the all time best drumming I have ever heard. 'Pursuance' has easily the best drum solo of all time! Eat your heart out John Bonham! 'Acknowledgement' opens the album with a bold statement wrapped in polyrythyms, While 'Resolution' like the title may suggest seems to be the answer or counter part to 'Acknowledgement.'<br /><br />As you all know A Love Supreme is a classic jazz album, but more than that it is a classic album of all time branching more that just jazz. So do yourself a favor and don't put it off any longer as I did. Because this must be heard to appreciate because my review chances are did not do it justice.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|A terrific series with brilliant cinematography! I DO wish that the producers (Tom Hanks certainly had the say) had left out the use of the tobacco drug. We don't need smoking or other use of tobacco in ANY movie. Otherwise, a memorable series that everyone over the age of 12 should see! I understand that the DVD extras as really supposed to be something. I've already got my order in for the set.
B000MCH5P4|3.0|Babel is really three unrelated films that have been combined by the slimmest of threads into one film.  There is the old saying that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Unfortunately, this film parts is greater than the whole.  Each story is interesting but when combined together they lose their individual punch.    The main story is about a boy who does something very stupid that sets up a series of events that changes everyone's life.  In a middle eastern country a shepard buys a hunting rifle to protect his flock from jackals.  He sends his two boys to tend the flock.  He gives the rifle to the oldest son.  After the missing a jackal, the boys blame the rifle.  The gun was suppose to have a range of about 2 miles.  The boys take the rifle to a ridge.  The older boy aims at a passing car that is at the bottom of the ridge (I assume that it's about a mile away.) and misses it.  The younger boy takes the rifle and shoots at a passing bus.  It appears that he also missed but then the bus suddenly stops.  The boys are overjoyed that they hit the bus.  But soon that joy is overshadowed by the fact that it turns out that an American tourist has been shot.    This storyline spirals out of control on two fronts.  The local government reacting to the finding the shooter and the treating of the wounded woman.  The first part is more interesting than the second.  Although, Brad Pitts performance as the shooting victim's husband is brilliant and Oscar worthy (but as a Supporting Actor, as this film really has no leads.)    If developed further, this would have made a fine film on it's own.    The second story involves a Mexican housekeeper trying to attend her son's wedding in Mexico.  But the problem her employers are out of town and she is responsible for the two children.  When she can not get anyone to take care of the children, she takes them with her.  The problem occurs when they try to return to the US.  This story is connected to the main story by the children belonging to the woman who was shot.  But there are too many problems with this storyline to enumerate.    The third story is about a deaf Japanese girl whose mother commited suicide and she is having trouble coping with life.  So she decides to act out sexually.  First \\"flashing\\" some boys at a restaurant and finally trying to seduce a police detective.  This story is very flimsily tied to the main by the rifle used to shoot the tourist was owned by the girl's father.    The film takes place over five days and this also created a credibility issue with the first two stories.  This is a film that wants to tackle too many issues on how the establishment oppresses poor.  But when you look at the main conflicts, the characters did very irresposible deeds that lead to their demise.    The only reason to see this film is Brad Pitt's \\"Best Film Performance.\\"  It really is.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|This is the funnest, most thoroughly enjoyable album Madonna has put out in years!  I love practically all of the songs, it is so fun and cute!  Standouts are Give it 2 me, heartbeat, devil, dance 2 night, beat goes on, voices, she's not me, and miles away!! Highly recommended, Madonna is back in top form!!
B00009RDGA|5.0|I came acrosst this movie late one night on cable, and it is now one of my favorites.  Tatum O'neal is wonderful.  There are some great extra's on the DVD as well.
B0012QE4Q2|4.0|Seeing that this movie is from a novel based on historical events, the general gist of the story may not be unfamiliar to most, although the accuracy of some of the content may be debatable.<br /><br />Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):<br /><br />1. Henry VIII (Eric Bana) was a handsome, hunky, hunka hunka burnin' love<br />2. Anne Boleyn (Natalie Portman) and her sister Mary (Scarlett Johansson) were babelicious babes<br />3. Married Henry didn't have an heir, so he wanted to pick up a spare<br />4. Sir Thomas Boleyn had tons of ambition and a couple of daughters to spare<br />5.

Off with her head!<br /><br />Warning to students:  Quoting the above in History class may be detrimental to your grades.<br /><br />More hysterical drama than historical drama, this movie seems more \\"Desperate Housewives\\" than period piece, but there's no denying that the costumes and sets are stunning, and the lead actors and actresses simply amazing, despite the lack of the proper accents.<br /><br />I'm going to vote for the entertainment factor here.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, April 28, 2008<br /><br />(*from the song by Herman's Hermits)
B0014KD46W|4.0|The new Winwood CD opens in fitting fashion, with \\"I'm Not Drowning,\\" a catchy acoustic blues number co-written and entirely performed by Steve (the one-man band act he's been known to do over the years).  The song is one of three standouts for me on the new long-player, the others being the soulful \\"Raging Sea,\\" featuring excellent guitar work by Jose Pires de Almeida Neto, and the much-heralded Winwood-Clapton single, \\"Dirty City.\\"  Some of the other songs at first seemed less substantial, such as a pleasant, smooth 7-minute tune called \\"Fly,\\" but I've appreciated those songs more on the 2nd and 3rd listen.  This is not Winwood's all-time best recorded work, but it's a respectable enough collection of new songs from a former kid prodigy who's still putting out good material in his fifth decade as a professional musician.
0307387151|1.0|I'm no stranger to long, involved novels; as a matter of fact most of my favorites are 400+ pages with plots so multi-layered and characters so complex you'll need to take notes just to keep up.  Although the genre I read the most is `mysteries,' I'm not wedded to just one type of book so, tried \\"Atonement\\" mostly due to all the hype.<br /><br />The first half or so of the book seemed alright--I wasn't keen on the paragraph-long sentences and the overwrought descriptions of just about everything, but not a big deal; figured I could live with it.  However, when I reached Part II (Robbie's Dunkirk exploits), that's when it became a struggle for me to even continue.  Nothing so far had impressed me, but as I've experienced many times before, there are authors who will work the reader hard, but the payoff will be worth it.  So onward I went to ---- what?  The most inane denouement I've ever read.  I actually felt cheated and this is a feeling I don't often get with my reading.  And this is the twist/ending that practically everyone was saying was brilliant?!  I actually re-read the last section just to make sure I didn't miss anything; perhaps some nuance that slipped by me, etc.  Nope.  Read everything, understood everything, and still felt cheated.  Deflated doesn't even come close to describing what I felt.<br /><br />Those greater than I, I'm sure, will be eager to comment on what a nitwit I am for \\"not getting IT,\\" it being what the rest of the civilized world gets and Philistines like me don't.  So be it, I welcome whatever comes with graciousness, but stand by my one-star review.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|The main gripe that i have with the movie obviously is the handy cam that they used throughout the movie.  The story was alright mixed with a bit of action as well.  But its too freakin annoying to spend an hour and a half watching this bounce all over the place missing shots and just making a mess of what could've been a half decent idea.  The monster that attacks the city....very, very scary (not really).<br /><br />Apart from the sproadic action and other things.  Cloverfield just turned out to be a clever idea that didn't come close to equally the sum of its parts or the massive hype that it generated from pretty much all corners of the internet.  That being said i'm not disappointed with purchasing it, but given the opportunity again.  I would probably just rent and watch it for an hour and 20 minutes then promptly return it the next day.<br /><br />None the wiser to the ending which i must say i didnt even come close to liking at all.  Word of advice if you love movies that have your stomach all over the place to the way a movie's shot this one is perfect for you.  Otherwise don't waste your money believe me.  You can spend that on something worthwhile like a barf bag perhaps.
0452289963|5.0|This book is worth its weight in gold!  I have participated in the televised classes using each chapter. This week we finished Chapter 9 and the last week is coming up for Chapter 10.    I do believe that the consumer/reader should be prepared to read and re-read many of the chapters.  This is not a book of fiction that can be read in one night.  It will take thought,effort and time to allow the material to settle in your mind and spirit.  Some people may not be ready for this voyage into understanding \\"Who they are!\\"
B00127RAJY|3.0|I have enjoyed these workouts[[ASIN:B00127RAJY Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred]]-while they are short, they are are definitely hard and useful. My only complaint is that there is no meal plan included with this product, or a chart of when to do each workout. Maybe that is self explanatory to some people, but I would prefer a chart that gives me an idea of how to start. In the video, Jillian just says move on when you think you're ready, but if you are still eating the way you always do without a thought to calorie intake, what good are you really doing yourself?
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|[[ASIN:B0016HNOXQ Third]]<br /><br />The last few years have been really good to me in terms of new music that I can listen to, but no group has been able to fill the void left by the absence of Portishead for way too long.  That's why, like so many fans, I have been salivating over this album ever since I heard they were working on it.  In fact I've been playing the [[ASIN:B000001FI7 Dummy]] and [[ASIN:B000003TSP Portishead]] albums almost continuously over the past 3 days before I got a hold of this.  :)<br /><br />Well, I listened to teasers and clips and then when I got my paws on my copy of Third I listened to it over and over.  I am very happy to be hearing Portishead again.  Sure, if I was forced to compare, I would have to say that `Dummy' still has no equal among their three studio albums and their other stuff too.  Still, this album is more experimental but isn't as far off as I thought it was going to be based upon the initial reviews I read.  This album is a winner for me.  It only took 4 listens for it to really grow on me.  At least now I know that they are working on more stuff, and I have no doubt that they will continue to produce great music as long as they keep making new stuff.<br /><br />They put out several teaser tracks over the past year that ended up making it on the album.  `Machine Gun' is one of those tracks, and it will undoubtedly be one of the first singles.  It just has a lot of mainstream appeal relative to other stuff on the album.  Something about that constant machine gun background that fits so well.  I'm surprised that some have singled out this song as being their least favorite, but I expect to hear this song commercialized and played often. The lyrics are another story, and you can be the judge as to the deeper meanings of this and other tracks.  ;-)<br /><br />But my favorite tracks are `Nylon Smile,' `Plastic' and `Magic Doors.'  `Nylon Smile' kind of feels like the Portishead we know and love.  `Plastic' takes advantage of that amazing voice that Beth Gibbons is famous for.  Not everybody likes it, but everybody has to take notice when they hear it!  And `Magic Doors' is just an awesome all-around song that in my mind joins the best of the new tone of this album with the best of old-school Portishead.<br /><br />But as a whole this album is a new direction.  Tracks like `Hunter' and `Threads' take the slow melancholy we have come to expect from Portishead and expand upon it.  And tracks like `Silence,' `Nylon Smile' and `We Carry On' add a faster urgent beat that makes them more club friendly.<br /><br />`Deep Water' and `Small' add the most food for thought to this album.  Each of those songs is a mood piece that really takes the melancholy this group is known for to new depths.<br /><br />All around the tracks seem to have put the Vocals more in the background than previous albums, which for me is a shame.  You still hear her voice come through, it's just with more effects and distance to soften it.<br /><br />Even though they are very different groups, listening to this album has really reminded me of Radiohead's progression over time from albums like [[ASIN:B000002UJQ OK Computer]] to [[ASIN:B00004XONN Kid A]] and [[ASIN:B000YXMMAE In Rainbows]].  This is not nearly as drastic a transition as Radiohead made from their earlier albums.  Yet we still see the progression of a band moving more and more into new and more experimental directions.  In a sense the melodic quality of the vocals have been toned down on this album just as they were on those others.  The rhythm and soundstage have been moved even more to the forefront on `Third.'<br /><br />I for one am happy with this and I will look forward to whatever Portishead produces next.<br /><br />Enjoy!ibbons is famous for.

0790729628|5.0|Blade Runner was a five star movie that had an exceptionally good plot.  It also featured astounding special effects which were amazing to see on the big screen.  Much of this work was done with large scale models and fog machines that really helped to establish the atmosphere and feel of the film visually. Several of the screen and sound effects were taken from Ridley Scott's Alien, including computer graphic screens and miscellaneous electronic sound effects.  In addition, the sets, models, and costumes were wonderfully organic, as were the original sets of Giger's from Alien.<br /><br />The story concerns humaniod robots in the first quarter of the 21st century that have intelligence and agility at least as great as that of the genetic engineers who designed them.  The robots are called Replicants because they are physically equivalent to human beings down to their organs, blood and bone structure. The strength and speed of these androids is much greater than that of a human, and they can be a great deal of trouble to deal with.<br /><br />The story takes for granted that such advanced robots possess true consciousness and are quite willing to fight and even kill human beings in order to continue their existance which has been intentionally limited to a life span of four years.  This is one of the few robot films to come out of Hollywood which does not depend on Asimov's three laws of robotics for the story.<br /><br />One new science fiction twist on robotics used in this film is the implanting of false memories of childhood, parents and a long prior existance. Though false, these implanted memories mean a great deal to the androids at the \\"emotional\\" level who carry photos of their false history, parents and childhood homes even when they are aware that these memories are false. This was a totally new concept to me as a long time fan of robots in science fiction film and gave me a new perspective on the value of memories.<br /><br />The film stars Harrison Ford who plays a special law officer or Blade Runner. As a Blade Runner he is authorized to use deadly force in the pursuit of \\"Replicants\\" to terminate (or retire) them on the planet Earth where their use has been banned.  The story becomes even more interesting when the Blade Runner falls in love with a beautiful female Replicant who is used to calibrate the andoroid detection software used by Blade Runner detectives.<br /><br />One scene which was particularly effective involved Harrison Ford revealing to the female android that she is artificial, something she has been unaware of since activation because of her false memory implants.  This is the scene in which Harrison Ford falls in love with this very beautiful \\"woman\\" because of her well portraid vulnerability, emotions and sadness at learning that she is artificial.  She is deeply hurt and shattered by the new knowledge and the tough Blade Runner instantly falls in love when she breaks down and silently cries after hearing his revelation and convincing evidence.al law officer or Blade Runner.

It doesn't matter if you're the only one in your neighborhood that is adhering to the changes, it has to start somewhere.

B0012E6R3W|4.0|I've being a fan since the mid 80's through thick and thin.  No other band comes close to TestAmenT's dedication, musical craftsmanship and contributions to the music scene.      With this release TestAmenT stands their ground and blasts out with each track the skills they finely tuned over 2 decades.  Attention grabbing vocals by Chuck, lightning fast riffs from Eric, jaw dropping solos from Alex (you are still a guitar shredding God!), Greg pounding the crap out of his bass and Paul filling in on drums.  All of this equals = the perfect example of the legendary thrash  gods re-united giving their fans what they want.  A masterpiece that will be hailed throughout time.    To the younger generation of fans.  Do yourself a favor.  Run and get this CD now.  Can't find it - demand it.  Crank the volume to 12 and make your parents know that metal hasn't died.  It's crawled back up from the underground and taking over!

B000002B2T|5.0|Can't say much more than I enjoyed this CD more than any Alice In Chains, or any other 90's Seattle scene music! Lots relative to the pain of heroin addiction, which Staley suffered and died from way too young. The CD lyrics, with the facts surronding Staley's demise, make it eerie to the point of good music causing gooseflesh! This CD is awesome. Good luck finding it anywhere else off the shelves. The bargain of my life was this CD, right here!

1401322336|4.0|I just love to watch Jamie on his BBC program, and this is the first of Jamie's books that I've purchased. (I'd now like to order one more of his famous books).<br /><br />Anyhow, what I simply love about this particular cookbook are all of Jamie's wonderful HINTS and GOOD INFORMATION that Jamie lays out for the reader at the very beginning of each Chapter and also within each sub-category.<br /><br />Because I've seen Jamie on TV so many times, I am very familiar with his (rather cute) lingo, such as \\"dollop\\" and \\"knob\\",for example. His lingo does not turn me off,as some have stated,  but rather, I like his way of speaking because it makes Jamie seem more REAL to me! .....And because Jamie projects such an approachable personality, the readers (and TV viewers) are, of course, instantly drawn to him and his cooking style.<br /><br />YES, there is a photo of every single recipe, and YES, that is a good thing!....As another commentator stated, \\"there is alot to be said for photos of every recipe\\".<br /><br />Some of the recipes would be hard for a beginner to duplicate , or even to comprehend. For example, \\"The Squash Sage and Amaretti Risotto\\" would be a difficult recipe for a beginner cook to visualize. Yes, the photos are tantilizing, however, some of the combinations may be hard to phathom (from a novice cook's perspective). Another example is the \\"Squid with Black Pudding stuffing and sticky tomato sauce\\" (hum???), or the \\"Perfectly Cooked Crispy Duck with Spiced Plum Chutney\\". Would a beginner \\"get it\\" or be turned off? (Just something for beginners to keep in mind).<br /><br />However, if a reader of this book has seen Jamie actually cook on TV and has seen how his chosen flavors can actually \\"work\\", then MOST of the recipes in this book are very doable,FUN,and exciting! These are some of my favorites:<br /><br />~~Summertime Tagliarini , p. 68<br />~~The best Onion Gratin, p. 333<br />~~Must-Try Red Cabbage, p. 358<br />~~Overnight SLOW Roasted Pork, p. 174<br />~~Rib Roast, p. 154<br />~~White Fish, p. 222<br />~~Black Cod, p. 226<br />~~Lemon Drizzle Cake, p.383<br />~~Easy Shortbread, p. 412<br />~~Schnitzels, p. 182<br />~~Baked Ham Shanks, p.162226  ~~Lemon Drizzle Cake, p.383  ~~Easy Shortbread, p. 412  ~~Schnitzels, p. 182  ~~Baked Ham Shanks, p.162
0143038419|4.0|Gilbert has an infectious style, a great sense of humor, and a gift for storytelling.  While the book is uneven, there are unforgettable moments (i.e. learning to quiet her incredibly unquiet mind in the ashram).  She may have had a book deal before writing it but it still felt honest to me.
B000FFJ85I|3.0|So basically, I am another one of those advocates for the older, hardcore punk sound that AFI used to wield on \\"Very Proud of Ya\\" and \\"Answer That\\" but in the past decade or more, there has never been an AFI CD that I haven't been able to listen to.    This CD actually might be better than some of the middle material that AFI put out, like \\"Sing the Sorrow\\" and \\"Art of Drowning\\"    Well, no, it's not. I wouldn't lie to you. Truth be told, this is the worst CD AFI has ever put out, having said that if you can put out your worst CD and get a three star rating from me, that says something about your band. Even though this is the CD that proves that AFI will never acknowledge, let alone return to, their punk roots, they can still make some really good music. Tracks like \\"Kill Caustic\\" and \\"Miss Murder\\" can be quite enjoyable for the fans of the old material, and the new softer and more experimental stuff like \\"37 mm\\" and \\"Love Like Winter\\" are actually quite enjoyable. The thing is you have to be in a certain mood to listen to this stuff, and it's not a CD you can \\"rock out\\" to, persay.    Having said that I must say that the vocals are so much better than their last three or four albums. Has anybody noticed that I can listen to an entire AFI CD such as \\"Sing the Sorrow\\" only to realize that I can only understand like 20% of the words Davey's saying, and that's not even exaggerating. Davey's voice changed alot from 2003 to 2006 and for me that's a welcomed change. I can actually understand him now for the most part.    I'll keep this as short as I can 'cause I'm sick of writing long reviews. If you buy this it's a gamble whether or not you'll like it. You probably will learn to accept it simply because it is AFI and it will grow on you, just keep an open mind. Know that this is not \\"Answer That\\" or \\"Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes,\\" heck, it's not even \\"Sing the Sorrow,\\" but it is pretty good, and the addition of influences from different decades of music while keeping an overall steady sound is not an easy thing to do and these guys should be credited for that.    Highlight tracks: \\"Kill Caustic\\" \\"Miss Murder\\" \\"The Killing Lights\\" and if you're into short little lullibies, \\"Prelude 12/21\\"

Not a geek, not an airhead, not a stereotype just fabulous!  Veronica is real and the acting is awesome, storylines with great twists.. I wish this show hadn't been cancelled but thankfully we can watch a couple of seasons worth on DVD.

0452289963|2.0|If you're one to blindly believe whatever you read, this book is for you.  It gets a bit cheesy for those of us who tend to question and analyze that with which we're presented.

But there's no way I'm going to ever say to my significant other, \\"What you just said really activated my pain body.\\"

B0012QE4Q2|3.0|\\"Is the audience really supposed to believe that Henry the VIII--the most powerful man in the land--would divorce Catherine of Aragon, separate from the Catholic church, and put England in upheaval simply because Anne refused to sleep with him until he jumped through all her hoops? \\"I have torn this country apart for you,\\" he hisses at her before finally getting his way.\\"    So states the Amazon Review for this movie.  At first glance, the comment would seem to make sense...until we remember that a group of crazy men were willing, in 1938, to start a world war and have millions of people executed for the sake of their own personal power ambitions?  After the lessons of the 20th Centry, is it too incredible that a King would tear his country apart for the sake of a woman he desires?
B0002CHIJW|1.0|Cut from the same mold as Last House On The Left, this is another highly disturbing & unsettling hour and a half of a woman being savagely raped & humiliated.  I couldn't recommend NOT buying this more.  Rape scenes have always disturbed me, but to make it even worse is the fact that the woman in the film is raped for what seemed like an endless ten minutes by one guy, then another five to ten minutes by the next & so on.  Five dirtbags, one after the other raping the woman & the rapes went on for a good twenty to twenty five minutes.  The only reason I watched to the end is, as horrible as it was, I wanted desperately to see them get what they had coming to them, & they did, but it is no consolation for the gratuitous nightmare that poor woman went through.  Really sick flick.  Not entertaining on any level.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|The so-called reviewer at the top of this page is on glue. This far surpasses what the crue has ever done. Much deeper in composition and lyrics than your average rock album. It paints images that tell a story of one man's struggle with addiction in a very lush, operatic way. I can see this being made into a rock musical play. I feel it stands up to the best of the best of the concept rock albums. It deserves a listen.
B000068IEU|1.0|This ranks right up there with I Spit On Your Grave.  I can't conceive how some fans of cult/horror films would possibly find something like this entertaining & want to put it in their collections.    It is NOT entertaining or enjoyable in the least.  Almost an hour & a half of two young women being raped & tortured by pathetic scumbags is not my idea of a good movie.  It is unnerving, unsettling & very sad.  I would have given it zero stars if I could, but that wasn't an option, I guess.  I strongly recommend not buying this film, it is well beyond redemption. In any case, don't say you weren't warned.
B000MV9026|4.0|The quality of the DVD is excellent but the subject matter is somewhat disturbing.  The movie is aimed at children but the problems mentioned in the movie (arctic pollution, overfishing, etc.) cannot be resolved easily and the movie's resolution is a disappointment.
B00003CXRP|5.0|I thought Tom was superb in his character as someone who alway holds it together, and then all of sudden he losses it. I thought Wow! what would you do to survive. He and his imaginary friend Wilson. I thought only Tom could have pulled this off. His acting was fantastic how he cried for his friend Wilson and I cried too. You can actually feel the pain that he felt for his friend. I was wondering why he didn't open that one package. you found out at the end. Great movie.

B0014Z4OQG|2.0|So, feeling like a big idiot for spending hard-earned cash to see this garbage film? Did they stamp the word \\"Sucker!\\" on your forehead as you left the theater? Bought the DVD? Worse yet, did you take a date to this movie and thereby ruined the occasion?    Fear not! You are not alone. Here's an easy way to recoup some lost dignity (though not your cash), maybe even gain a bit of respect: intellectualize and philosophize about it.    First, you must throw out the notion that you saw a horror-sci-fi-monster flick. No, no, no...what you experienced was actually symbolism, social commentary, and psychological analysis. Forget the puerile suggestions of a Sept. 11th allegory; you must delve much, much deeper than that.     Our cinematic journey begins in NYC's Central PArk West with a bit of morning-after nonsense involving our protagonist and this babe. They video tape a date to Coney Island (how quaint), then quickly moves to a SoHo loft party the following month. A lot has happened in the interim: our hero received an uber promotion in his company but this requires relocating to Japan; also, we are subtly informed that our hero and his girl friend have remained incommunicado since that one night stand the previous month. Why? Beats me, but for someone so savvy as to live in a SoHo loft, move up the corporate (we assume) ladder and land a dream job while still in his early twenties, he sure comes across as a Hamlet-esque dolt. But I digress.    On the occasion of this party we meet the next group of unidimensional characters- a \\"how-dare-I-be-so-beautiful\\" clique of upper echelon Obama voter types. In other words, just the sorta people you'd expect to live and party in SoHo. There's the best friend whose portable camera documents the events as they happen (in the process recording over the tape of the lovers' date to Coney Island, but more on that later). Then there's our hero's brother and two other babes, one of which is truly stunning.    Believe it or not, tensionbuilds at the party (Say it ain't so, TGav!). Our protagonist feels chagrined that his former girlfriend arrives towing some Adonis looking dude and he lets her know it. She storms out. Our hero then wallows in self pity \\"woe is me\\" moment. Now the fun begins.    Far away explosions, the lights flicker. This being L.A. it must be earthquake...err.. NO...scratch that... This being Kansas it must be tornadoes... whoops..let's try again...this being NYC it must be terrorists. Okies, lets go with that. But of course this is not the case. We are teased with a glimpse of a tail here, a shadow there. Flaming debris falls from the heavens faster than you can say \\"a screaming comes across the sky\\". Pandemonium ensues. Everyone bolts to the streets below.    Now comes the \\"money shot\\" of this movie. IMO, a good 50% of gross ticket sales this movie made can be attributed to this one scene ubiquitous in trailers and commercials. Yes, none other than the Lady Liberty head conveniently landing scratched but otherwise intact despite the distance and velocity catapulted (they don't make statues like they used to) just as our heroes emerge outside. Sadly,the director neglected to include dead tourists mangled corpses visible in the crown, which is the statue's observation deck and usually full of people. Granted, the action took place late at night, but would've been a nice touch anyway. Maybe it can be CGed in the BluRay release. But I digress again.    Now, once we realize that what we have here is in fact a monster run amok in NYC and bent on mayhem and destruction, we could've had a nice formulaic H'wood flick. But nooooooo. The director instead turns cerebral and tries to learn us somethin. So furrow your brow, sport a concerned look as you slowly stroke your chin and ponder the double-secret meaning behind this waste of perfectly good celluloid (or videotape, as the case may be).    You see, life gets more complicated the older we are and full of bitter sacrifices. Despite his great professional gains our hero has lost his own liberty, the freedom of choice is kept in check by consequences, in this case abandoning his true love in order to seize an opportunity. He realizes this I think in the alley as they run. His friends, too, chose, to their detriment. Somethings sacrificed, however, cannot be undone. Just don't try to convince our hero of  that. Or his ditsy entourage.    And waht of the monster? What is it? Where did it come from? Notice its inexplicable appearance just after the girlfriend makes her exit and how it follows the group during their forlorn quest. Could it be a symbol of our hero's angst and inner turmoil of love lost never to be regained, of regrets, the chaos of his life in general despite its superficial attractiveness? In the brilliant 1985 movie \\"Brazil\\", the hero Sam Lowry fantasizes a battle against a giant Samurai warrior, which symbolizes suppressive totalitarianism. Similarly, this creature could be just a symbolic figment of the protagonist's imagination as he sits there morose and all at his own party pondering his past decisions.    Or perhaps he willed it to be real, to destroy the material world which entraps him. Much like in Ghost Busters, but instead of Mr. Stay Puft marshmallow sailor let lose in NY, this time it's the Mother-of-All-Sushi monster giving lower MAnhattan some payback. And how apropos the Godzilla analogy considering he's moving to Japan! Had it been PAris where he was going, I'd have expected millions of arrogant waiters materializing to ridicule everyone's taste in wine thus driving all Americans to suicidal madness. Not quite the dramatic effect though.    It kills his brother, his best friends, it destroys the only shred of innocence and happiness remaining in his life up until then. We see only a few moments here and there of the original tape recording they made in Coney Island when life was still simple and less grown up. Interestingly, this patchy broken glimpse into that day is about as much as we see of the creature itself. We can understand it but never appreciate it in full and uninterrupted.    And in the end? A sense of final happiness as the recording ends and the tape continues with the original footage of an earlier life. So does the indestructible monster finally die, defeated by the couple's admission of love? That depends if you're a romantic or an existentialist.    This was one lousy movie smartly but deceitfully marketed. It is nauseating not because of the faux-amateur hand-held camera technique, but rather by virtue of its amateurish acting, simpleton plot if taken at face value, and arrogant presentation. If I pay to see a brain dead monster flick, then please deliver what I want. I can get plenty of allegory from reading Dante, and there's plenty of honest experimental and enigmatic cinema out there without the need to ambush the public.    But oh, yeah, I forget..it's a deep movie. Allegory and stuff.

0307346617|1.0|This book is terrible.  As all the other negative reviews have pointed out, each character in the book is indistinguishable from the next, which I suppose hardly matters since we only meet each one for a few pages anyway.  Here's an interview with a Chinese guy - we know he's Chinese because Brooks has him use a couple Chinese words in his interview.  Hey now, here's a Cuban guy - how do we know?  That's right, he says 'cabron' a couple times or something.  Is this the Japanese guy?  Well of course it is, he just said a couple words in... Japanese!  Those are some pretty brilliant characterizations.  An Italian general uses high school football as a metaphor at one point, and no I don't mean the soccer kind of football.  Know many Italian generals that drop American football references into their daily conversation?  The editor of the book must have been just as indifferent in reviewing it as Brooks was in writing it.<br /><br />Brooks' attempts to provide plausible explanations for the events that take place actually are so ridiculous that they only serve to take you further out of the narrative.  A sub descends to the limits of its crush-depth, but the zombies have no trouble surviving down there... WTF?!?!  We're told the zombies decay and eventually 'die', but in the next sentence it's mentioned that if you lock them in a room for three years, they'll magically survive to be as potent as when you first left them... HUH?!?!  Soldiers need special 'bite-proof' kevlar armor.  I've got a better, cheaper idea - try denim, that stuff is more than tough enough to stop blunt human teeth!  Modern artillery, bombs, and automatic weaponry designed solely to shred the human body into a bloody smear are impotent against the zombies, and humanity's greatest equalizers are... sharpened shovels?  WHA?!?!?  It just goes on and on...<br /><br />Actually worse than 'Fitzpatrick's War', which is cut from the same cloth as a future-history retrospective, and that book is godawful...
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|I love music and i love Madonna ever since she bursted onto the scene in the 80's. But like most iconic artist of her time & genre like Janet Jackson she has lost her SPUNK! Madonna lost it when the 90's rolled around but made a comeback with Ray of Light in 1997 since it was something different but by no means was it a great album as the critics hailed it to be. For this decade i predicted one more comeback based on the fact she was working with Timbaland who does wonders for many other artist. When i heard she was working with Pharell i was a bit disappointed. To make a long story short i'm a realist i am not going to sugar coat anything. This is a pretty bad album. The lead single is ok but doesn't have the HOOK to reel you in & make you feel invested. I purchased the album hoping other tracks would be worth wild but my calls have fallen on deaf ears. The album is beyond awful.<br /><br />As stated she hasn't done anything interesting in many years. Her mini mouse healium voice she had in the 80's which was quite appealing is obviously gone since you evolve as an artist. She completely goes off the deep end on this album.<br /><br />Everyone who rated this a 5 star album i would love to know if they actually listened to the whole thing & if they are even true fans of R&B music.<br /><br />This isn't a great album. I feel like it's an acquired taste like Gwen Stefani's The Sweet Escape. Experimental music with producers that were the IT producers a few years ago. Perhaps the album would be good if she didn't co-write the songs with the producers. I feel her co-writing messed with their mojo.<br /><br />Considering she's suppose 2 be a trendsetter she decided to work with these producers in 2008 when everyone already used them back in 2006.<br /><br />So much 4 trendsetting. For this album she should of been using the following producers:<br /><br />Darkchild/Stargate/The Dream/Tricky/Scott Stortch/Soul Shock/Danja and Will.i.am. Darkchild has done wonders for Janet Jacksons comeback. Stargate & The Dream wrote \\"Umbrella\\" for Rihanna and also \\"Touch My Body\\" for Mariah. Pharell is just ruining this album for me. Timbaland is sooo 2006 even though he did wonders for Nelly Furtado and i do think he is a good producer if Madonna doesn't co-write the songs with him.<br /><br />The album so far is disappointing & so is the lead single.<br /><br />Britney was smart. She worked with the same folks but didn't co-write any of the songs. Not 2 say that her album was any better.<br /><br />Also please bare this in mind. Madonna has been in the business for almost 3 decades. Like any job you have there comes a point where you feel you've mastered the art & it's no longer a challenge. You become so GOOD at what you do that you become INVALUABLE. Like a long running sitcom with no more jokes to tell, its time to lower the curtains.<br /><br />Madonna please stop playing your FANS the way you have for so many years.\\"Umbrella\\" for Rihanna and also \\"Touch My Body\\" for Mariah.

B000Z1LOBI|5.0|Yes it's a turn in a heavier direction for Testament, and less \\"thrashy\\". Nonetheles this is an excellent, catchy, brutal album with crushing production that is grossly underrated and overlooked. Heavy, memorable, melodic guitar hooks, punding rhythm section, excellent writing, and Chuck really bellowing from his guts, adds up to one of the most memorable albums from 1997, a metal masterpiece, meant to be cranked. If you didn't like it, you don't \\"get it\\".  Amust-have for any Testament fan and for any fan of good, powerful, well-crafted metal with top-notch lyrics.
B000002NJS|4.0|Like most artist as famous as Madonna you reach a point where you lose your SPUNK. For Janet Jackson she did 3 GLITTER albums back to back. Her GLITTER's were All For You, Damita Jo, and 20 YEARS OLD. For Madonna the arrival of the 90's was when this pop diva's time seemed to come to an end. Instead of addictive pop songs she seemed to soften with time and giving more ballads then anything else. But being a true fan i still brought every CD. After a few duds back to back it would be 1997 where we saw Madonna at the top of her game again with something different, creative, and CUTTING EDGE!! Now this album is great but in no means a masterpiece the way the critics hailed it to be. With any release from a commercial artist you will be lucky to find 5 good songs on a 12 track album while the rest turn out to be DUDS!!! Overall this is a pretty good album. The ones after this were total DUDS as well and in 2008 with the creative team of Timbaland i expected to see this diva back on top with another come back. Instead HARD CANDY disappoints and more like a treat that's a bad memory of Halloween.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Haha... I just liked the movie because it challenged me intellectually, contrary to other Hollywood works... It also included a piece of Beethoven's 5th which I was playing in my school orchestra at the time. But overall the idea developed in the story just blew me away.
B000OZ2CZW|2.0|A 1 TRICK PONY!!!!! She realizes her albums only get carried by how addictive & well produced the 1st single is. I can see why she releases a new album every year. 1 song doesn't make a great album and doesn't carry it to multi platinum success. Every commercial artist these days seem to be releasing DUD albums. It's so hard to even find 4 to 5 songs that are good on any new release these days. Beyonce please take note that 10 songs does not make an album. Cassie 9 songs & 2 interludes do not make an album. As for Rihanna, your strength lies in great POP tracks. Please don't try with the ballads. In the song Unfaithful you sound like your whining non stop. Now please stick to what your good at and it's called great POP songs without a trace of R&B because I don't hear the R&B in your voice at all.
B0013J559S|3.0|Not a shoot 'em up action film like an American film might be,<br />this has high class/ low class London meeting over<br />some very dirty secrets in a bank vault.<br />It seems to be a European version version where R rating borders on X.<br />It has humor and torture among all the sex and nudity,<br />but is well filmed and the acting is mostly pretty good as well<br />( better than Hollywood's norm these days at least!)<br />I just don't like the level of dirt involved here.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|I thought the concept of the movie was brilliant, and I really enjoyed the monster trashing NYC.  The only drawback was the collection of slacker, twentysomething, dude-esque nincompoops running around in front of the camera.  The monster should have knocked off these folks right away.  Next time, let's have way more monster and way less nincompoops.
B00005JLSE|5.0|This is one of the best movie adaptations of a musical.  I love how the action is mixed into the staged songs.  Catherine Zeta-Jones is excellent and I thought that John C Reilly was unexpectedly phenomenal.  I have a few very masculine guy friends who resisted seeing it and thought it would be horrible--they ended up loving it, too.  Fantastic!
B00009W0WM|3.0|Casablanca is a good film but not a masterpiece. The story is bit boring but the love triangle is the best part of the film. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman had incredible chemistry together, they are magic on-screen. This little black & white film noir is a classic but expext some flaws. Take it or leave it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Tough workout!  Start with level one even if you think you are in good shape.
B00003CXFV|1.0|Erin Brockovich is a slow, boring, and contrived film. Julia Roberts didn't deserved that Best Actress Oscar, that honor should've been given to Ellen Burstyn for Requiem for a Dream. Robert's acting is pretty bad in this film, she's given better and heartfelt performances than this! Albert Finney is the only one who makes a lasting impression. The story sounds good but doesn't translate through film. Don't waste your time and money on this turkey.
B000NVL1XQ|5.0|The movie offers an overview of pre-judgement and prejudice of the law enforcement community of the time. Denzel's acting is absolutely perfect as he portrays his role. Mr. Washington, said it himself on an interview, that he liked his acting better in this movie, than in Acadamey Award performance in the movie \\"Training Day\\".
B000I2JDEY|3.0|Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? is a classic film from director Mike Nichols. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton set the screen ablaze, they play Martha and George who have a bitter and intense relationship. Taylor received her second Oscar for this film. Some of the dialogue is too long-winded and overwhelming which makes this film boring at times. This satire is good just not excellent, it's a mixed bag for me.
B000FZEQSM|4.0|The story has continuity as it develops the main theme of the movie. The leading actors deliver a superb acting.
B000OVLBF8|3.0|Ghost Rider starring Nicholas Cage is a fun but predictable film. Cage is wonderfully cast as Johnny Blaze but jeez who's dummy who cast Eva Mendes, that gal can't act! Peter Fonda, Sam Elliott, and Wes Bently also star, each have great moments in the film. The special effects are the best thing in the film but the story is muddled so that's why I give the film only three stars. Definitely one to watch, give it a chance.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Great CD...great to listen to while working out and running on a treadmill.    Stand out tracks:    INCREDIBLE  THE BEAT GOES ON  GIVE IT 2 ME
B0013J1WKY|5.0|All I can say is Christina's delivered a strong performance which hard for other singers out there to compete. I really enjoy watching this dvd and I dare to say that this is the best concert that I ever seen.  This dvd is a must for Christina's fan to own.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|This CD is another piece of c..p that is loaded with made up sounds and from it you can see that Madonna can't sing at all. Weak lyrics and bad songs. Don't buy it because will be a waste of MONEY. I am selling it because is horrible..... Terrible CD. Instead try something else. Try something better. This ALBUM really sucks!!!!<br /><br />Madonna please retire!!!!!
1416523359|4.0|after reading all the negative reviews i felt it was necessary to give a positive one.  i loved this book, i read it in 2 days, so it is certainly possible that it is able to keep one's attention easily.  lisey and scott's story is incredibly poignant, the story of a life together with a little twist, brilliant.  people keep complaining about the language used in the book, come on, give me a break. it is not that hard to follow and the language is the key to the story, it makes it what it is and i loved it, it was one of my favorite things about this novel. i think people need to stop comparing this to other king books because clearly it is not the same.  i can understand why some die hard fans might be unable to digest lisey's story, but i think you have to appreciate it for what it is, it is not every other story he has ever written and frankly i think that is refreshing.<br /><br />so yes, if you find it challenging to read something a little more complex, not so straightforward, then maybe you should skip this.  but lisey's story is a great book and i think it is sad that just because it isn't the same predictable horror novel people are not giving it a chance.
B00169XU8I|5.0|It's tough to be a pop star when you are Madonna, possibly the most hardworking woman in the world. The recent Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee returns for her swan song with Warner Bros., Hard Candy. While Confessions on the Dance Floor was decidedly electronic disco, Hard Candy is what Madonna does best - a dance record without all the preaching and profundity.<br /><br />Candy Shop, the opener, is outright campy with a hypnotic beat and tongue-in-cheek lyrics like \\"Come on in to my store, I've got candy galore. Don't pretend you're not hungry, I've seen it before.\\" Give It To Me  may have been co-written by Pharrell Williams but reeks of early Madonna circa 1983 (think Everybody). 4 Minutes is the crowd-pleaser of the moment but is not the best on Candy. Heartbeat is where Madonna goes basal, singing about dancing and being so free on the dance floor, all to a hard rocking beat. It's so glorious that you'd immediately imagine yourself working out a sweat to it.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Timbaland and Justin Timberlake work their magic through tracks like Miles Away, a glowing electronic track about long distance love; She's Not There with its funky trademark interlude/bridge; and Incredible, Madonna's ode to hubby, Guy Ritchie's powerful bed thrusts. Devil Wouldn't Recognize You, the stylish ballad about infidelity, is set to grace Madonna's live tracklist in years to come. The album closes with the most lyrically introspective song about breaking free, Voices.<br /><br />Hard Candy is what happens when FutureSex/Lovesounds meet Confessions on a Dance Floor. Yet, at any given moment, it's hard not to notice this is a Madonna album after all. It's been a long while since Madonna just wants to have fun and get into the groove. Like a song from her last album, like it or not, our grand lady of pop is here to stay.<br /><br />The limited edition comes in a DVD case with two bonus remixes of 4 Minutes,a pack of candies and 16-page hard booklet.
B00169N0BK|5.0|I recently purchased the Colormunki and I had to submit a review. In short I am blown away. I currently use the more expensive EyeOne Photo at work....I think it cost around $1500.00. Well, the Colormunki does a great job, I have used it on my Dell laptop as well as my iMac and both look great.<br />I then built 2 profiles for some papers I use often. Both profiles revial the ones I made with the EyeOne.<br />I have not used it for a projector yet, but, from what I have seen I am sure it will be great.

B00130UFY2|4.0|Movie was great, but the slow download means the on demand feature is too slow to be practical. It took 30 minutes to BEGIN the download and about two more hours to actually download!
B0018CA996|4.0|Portishead - where have you been???  Welcome back!!!  This new album is a welcome return, though old-school fans from the early and mid 1990's will miss the trip-hop sound that Portishead helped create.  That said, it's a logical next-step for the project and sounds good.  Not many radio-friendly tracks on this album but who cares?  It's a well-crafted album.  Hopefully we won't have to wait over a decade for their next one!
B000LV63SQ|4.0|According to the liner notes off the vinyl album, Pete Townshend and the late Ronnie Lane play all sorts of instruments and \\"very involved mind games\\" not to mention the fact that taken as a pair, and as the photo attests, they are truly the rock & roll cro-magnons when it comes to their looks.  But appearance means nothing when it is talent that counts, and the mind games resulted in a pearl of a recording effort.  There was a hint of what Townshend and Lane were capable of on Evolution on Who Came First.  The hint blossomed with Rough Mix.     The other reviewers have it right, the two gems on this are Keep Me Turning and Heart To Hang Onto.  Street in the City is overproduced in my opinion, but the rest is a solid effort, with an especial nod to Till the Rivers All Run Dry, a great last cut on a par with Pavardigar on Who Came First.  Townshend as a solo act is not The Who, he is Pete Townshend and teaming up with Ronnie Lane makes as sublime a product as can be found.  The supporting cast is superb, with Eric Clapton helping out on guitars, Henry Spinetti providing a steady beat, and Rabbit on keyboards.    You don't need to be a Townshend or Lane fan to appreciate Rough Mix, just someone who loves to listen to rock and roll.  RIP, Ronnie.
1416523359|5.0|While it wasn't much in the way of suspenseful, scary, or frightening, in the tradition of most of King's work, 'Lisey's Story' shines through King's wonderful attention to character development and emotion. He makes you like the characters, namely Lisey, as she battles grief over the loss of her husband.     I know a lot of fans will say they didn't enjoy it, and that's perfectly reasonable. King's writing style has greatly changed over the last decade or so, and this is a very different story than anything else he's written. For one thing, it's a romance, a genre King has done generally little with. But nonetheless, King shows his versatility when it comes to writing, and it made for a very good story. I'd have to say this is one of my favorites of King's work, and I've read pretty much everything by the man    Very good, and it's something I will probably read again.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Perhaps a little farfetched but a movie to lift your heart.  A great movie for any age.
0618871713|5.0|An absolutely brilliant, hard to put down and very moving story. I go back to it often and think about it always. Beautiful, witty, hilarious.
B00007GZR5|1.0|If you want to know about Heaven and Hell, it's all in the Bible. God has already given us a glimpse of both and this movie isn't even close.<br /><br />The main issue I have with this movie is that the message, theme and core story of the film are not original and created ideas of the author and script writers. The author didn't just sit down and think up the idea of God, the afterlife, Heaven and Hell and the ways to these places. God has provided us with all of this information in the Bible and most people know this. God tells us of these places and how anyone will enter into either domain. Apparently, the author disagrees with what God has told us and has taken the and descriptions of those places and twisted them into his own vision. Which makes this whole idea a blatant lie, contradiction and attack on God's word. The author and movie makers knew this and did it anyway. This is why I diagree with the whole concept of the story and film. This also makes reviewing the actors performances, cinematography, graphics, and music score moot.<br /><br />In this movie, you can make your own Heaven, and God has no name as not to offend anyone (political correctness strikes again). He's portrayed as \\"somewhere up there\\", even in His own Kingdom. The name Jesus isn't even spoken, even though He sits at the right hand of the Father and is Lord, king and judge of all. I thank God that this idea of Heaven isn't even close to the real one. People just hang around or fly around and create their own customized heaven, nonsense. People are also exactly the same in this heaven as they are on earth. Theres pain, anger and swearing in this idea of heaven. You can even take God's name in vain there!!! I don't think so. God's Heaven is peace and joy for those who have called upon the name of Jesus Christ as Lord before death. In the movie, everyone is totally consumed with their own feelings for each other and there's no love for God which should be the greatest and strongest love of all. There's also the option of reincarnation, which is also not Biblical at all. Why would you ever want to come back here anyway after you were already in Heaven? The real Heaven that is, not this boring and self indugent one of the movie. The Bible also makes it clear that no one can cross over from Heaven to Hell or Hell to Heaven. This movie disreagards that too and makes that possible. God gave man dominion over the earth, but Heaven is His.<br /><br />Which brings us to the other side, Hell. This movie also directly contradicts the Bible by saying, \\"the real Hell is your life gone wrong\\". No, the real Hell was made for the devil and his demons. Hell is also a place for those who've rejected Jesus Christ as Lord. God's word clearly states that there is only one unforgivable sin, and that is to blaspheme the Holy Spirit, which means to reject Jesus Christ as Lord and make God out to be a liar by denying the truth.  The movie also says, \\"Hell isn't all fire and torment\\". That's also wrong, God has already told us that it is. All of our senses are intact and there is searing heat, pain and knowledge of where you are and that you put yourself there by rejecting God's way of salvation through His Son Jesus Christ. The movie also allows for those in Hell to go to Heaven. Wrong. Judgement is final and eternal. God is in control. But the movie yet again wants man to be in control. The Hell in this movie is a total joy and paradise compared to the real Hell. In the real Hell, there is no moment of peace, even to sit and be depressed. No one returns and all is ultimate suffering and torment. But the worst of it all is being separated from God forever and knowing that you could have accepted the free offer of salvation through Jesus Christ.<br /><br />This movie portrays secular society's false sense of hope that we're all basically good, without need of salvation and that as long as we don't kill anyone, we're all going to Heaven. It's just not true. We're all sinners,just the same and all in need of salvation. God doesn't send us to Hell, without Jesus, we're already on our way there. We're already condemned and sitting on death row. Jesus bore the sins of the world on His own shoulders so that we may forgiven and be freed from condemnation. We can be saved if we'll just accept what He did. Repent, call upon his name and ask Him into your life as Lord and Savior. You can know God now and His great and abounding love for you. Now is the time of salvation, life can end for anyone of us at anytime. Call upon the name of the Lord while He may be found.<br /><br />Jesus said, \\"Trust in God, trust also in me. In my Fathers house are many mansions, if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you. I will come back and take you with me that you also may be where I am. I am the way the truth and the life. No one comes to the father except through me\\". (John 14:1-6)<br /><br />Because God so loved the world, He sacrificed His only Son Jesus Christ, and all those who repent and call on the name of the Lord Jesus will be saved. God didn't send His Son into the world to condemn it but that the world through him may be saved. (John 3:16-17)ed of salvation. God doesn't send us to Hell, without Jesus, we're already on our way there. We're already condemned and sitting on death row.

B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Like most others...I was a bit skeptical at the beginning.  While I absolutely love Timbaland's production on other records, I wasn't quite sure about his working with Madonna.  Madonna??!?  Of course, anything he touches usually turns into dance music gold...and this is no exception!  Even the Pharrell-produced tracks are good...except for Spanish Lesson....which really could have been left off.  This album is, hands down, one of the best--if not THE best--of 2008.  What I found so intriguing is that even though Madge had hip-hop producers work with her, the results are so \\"her\\", and more dance than hip-hop.  Even Kanye West's contribution on \\"The Beat Goes On\\" is more danceable rap than gangsta, and it really adds pep to that track.  I have a feeling a lot of people were expecting Madonna to go all Missy Elliott/Lil' Mama/Soljah Boy on us, but we should know better!!!    The two best tracks on this CD are by far \\"Heartbeat\\" and \\"The Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\".  The latter is so good, it leaves you humming the tune long after you hear it.  The former is a great dance track all by itself, but the remixes for this should be absolutely awesome (if it becomes a single).  The two singles \\"4 Minutes\\" and \\"Give It 2 Me\\" are actually kind of weak compared to the others, with \\"Give\\" being a great tune for remixing! (I can't wait for that!)  The closer \\"Voices\\" is also really good, and those ringing dark bells at the end are a great way to close out a great album.    All in all, this whole album is great, and sorry Mariah, it's better than E=MC2.  This one has the potential to be a real contender for most albums sold by the end of the year.  Keep your fingers crossed!
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing; I love it, and it's a very strong effort; there is only one song I can appreciate, and it's the first single, \\"4 minutes\\"; it's the weakest song on the album, it sounds banal; that song has nothing to do with the other songs and with the whole album; I can't understand why Madonna has wanted it as the first single; it doesn't represent the album.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love that this workout video is not meant to be for experts right away!  There are three separate workouts on here: beginners, moderate, and hard.  Jillian uses simple moves that get your heartrate up and you feeling good about exercising!  I have tried a LOT of exercise videos, but have quit them all - this one I am sticking with because I: 1.) Can feel the effects right away and 2.) It's only a 20 minute workout!
B000QQFKYE|4.0|You have probably gathered by now that this is a surrealist film in David Lynch's most extreme style.  (I should probably say watching it is a surreal experience as it probably isn't strictly a surrealist film).    The imagination, drama, and power for which we love his work is all there. And so is the mystery, in spades.  If you thought Mulholland Drive was hard to understand or, in simpler English, didn't make sense, you ain't seen nuffin' till you've watched this one.      The typical comment of artists when facing an enquiry of something hard to understand is to declare the question invalid.  There's nothing to understand, it just is.  But everything has to have some standard against which it can be judged.  If it isn't supposed to mean anything, if the plot isn't supposed to make sense, if there is no answer to the question whether a certain incident is a scene from the film within the film or a scene in the actress's \\"inland empire\\" of the mind, then there must be some other route to appreciation or coherence.  If I tell you I had a weird dream, and proceed to list a meaningless series of random events, that won't be very interesting to you.  It may be interesting if I succeed in showing how those events are symbolic for actual conflicts in my life.    So the question we need to ask is whether the lack of narrative is justified, whether all this weirdness, mystery and incoherence actually achieves anything.  Does it add up to some real insight about this unfortunate lady's mind or does it just tell us that she was as deranged as we feel on leaving the cinema?  In the case of Mulholland Drive I was in no doubt the answer was yes, it was justified.  You couldn't express the events of the film as a logical narrative but you felt that the strangeness pointed the way to an understanding of what Lynch was trying to say.      My question is by definition very hard to answer.  It may be worth watching the film just to try to answer it.  (But bearing in mind how long and slow it is, that's not certain).  In my view the case for Inland Empire is much weaker than Mulholland Drive.  Mulholland Drive was definitely a good film, and one that rewarded a second viewing.  After watching Inland Empire I was unconvinced.  Maybe a second viewing would have convinced me, but I didn't feel like watching it again.
B000BO0LKY|5.0|Mariah Carey is one of my Fav. Singers.  I really love all her albums.  She stays true to herself and her type of music.. No matter how she dresses or does her hair :).  Oh,  and by the way.. who ever added the tag suggestions of fat, flop,  and terrible.. Quit hating.  You have to really be jealous to take the time out to insult people online.  either jealous or really inerested.  Mariah Carey makes money for her singing.  People do like her.. regardless of what she does with her life or looks like.

0800177975|4.0|Im one of those few people who got the joke. I got the joke back in 1993 when it came out. I know that this movie was meant to spoof those absurd action movies.<br /><br />Premise: Daniel gets a magic ticket from a movie store owner given to him by Houdini. While watching the latest Jack Slater movie, Daniel gets transported into the movie itself and ends up joining Jack Slater(played by Arnold) in his crazy adventures. This particular adventure involves Jack finding out the killer of his brother.<br /><br />Opinion: There are plenty of good things to say about this movie and a few bad things to say about this movie. The action is plentiful and the sets look great. That kid is annoying little wimp though. The humor hits(the outlandish stunts, shooting TNT away with bullets, the hackneyed catchphrases, a funeral filled with strapped mob families etc)as well as misses(Slater's daughter screaming like an idiot while thrashing a bad guy in her room and the cartoon police cat WTF?). My biggest gripe with the film is that it has to constantly explain itself through that craven kid. Its obvious that Daniel is the voice of reason in this movie and what an annoying voice that is! You mean to tell me that somebody breaks into your house armed with a knife, dares you to stab them in the back with the knife and you do nothing? What a wuss! Besides these flaws, this movie is still underrated gem that is worth picking up. A noteworthy satire on ludicrous action flicks.
B000PWQPAC|5.0|Fantastic movie if your a fan of the show you will LOVE this , all our favorites are back ! takes off right were the tv program left off ! the voices are all the same which I love ! I've watched it 4 times already just LOVE it !
0790731002|2.0|I remember me and my brother going to see this movie in theaters when it first came out. My jaw dropped at how bad it was. Batman and Batman Returns are both classics but the sequel went down the tubes when Joel Screwmacher(of St. Elmo's Fire fame) was allowed to take full control of the Batman franchise. It's not as bad as Batman and Robin but it's still kind of weak for an installment in the Batman series.<br /><br />Plot: Edward Nigma/Riddler(Jim Carrey) plans to destroy Bruce Wayne for ignoring his idea of a mind control device. Two Face is hell bent on destroying Batman for a freak accident that disfigured half of his face. Riddler and Two-Face team up eventually to destroy Batman(Val Kilmer).<br /><br />Opinion: This movie is so far from what Batman is that it's insane. Tim Burton's stunning and dark appeal was traded for light and fluffy approach to the series. The Riddler was bent on confusing people with riddles not a machine that drains IQs from unsuspecting victims like this  movie has him doing. Jim Carrey's role is The Riddler is excruciating and Tommy Lee Jones role as Two-Face is more over-the-top than his role in Natural Born Killers. Nicole Kidman is about as wooden as a Lincoln log in her role as Chase Meridian. Val Kilmer as Batman is like having Brendan Fraser or Pauly Shore play James Bond. Val Kilmer is a great actor but he looked like he was sleepwalking through this movie. The action scenes are somewhat decent but thats it. And when Batman walked away from Chase Meridian with a smile on his face after she said that she was in love with Bruce Wayne is the corniest scene ever. Only get this to complete the collection. This movie is one of the reasons why Batman Begins exists.
0670018651|5.0|Finally, perfume criticism is coming into its own.  With this bracing, educational, and witty guide, Turin and Sanchez blow away the empurpled PR prose and provide a much-needed reality check.  And, fortunately for us, they do it with style and verve.  Their respective writing styles turn the book into a page-turner.  Luca in particular manages to describe how something smells with a lapidary precision that occasionally takes the breath away.     Of course I didn't agree with some of their reviews; so what?  I'm just thrilled somebody finally had the chutzpah to say \\"Hey, this stinks\\" as well as the more usual glowing praise.  Candid and opinionated discussion can only be good for the perfume industry in the end.      Who knew perfume reviews could be this much fun?
B0000024TT|5.0|Yeah, I know, I sound like an ole curmudgeon, well I am and am happy to be so. I was living on the island of Ibiza back in the '60's when this album arrived in Santa Eulalia on the back of a Harley. Like many of us who were fortunate enough to have been around back then and lived to tell tall tales, Leonard does not get older, just ages like fine wine. A couple of other albums that appeared in Art's Bar around that time were Nashville Skyline and The White Album. We were/are blessed to have had such music as the soundtrack to our journey. Before leaving England and setting out on the road in the early 60's the hottest band around was Georgie Fame, I was in the Flamingo the night he recorded the live album.  If you aren't familiar with his eclectic body of work, do yourself a favor and check it out, he's also older and grayer but still grooving.  Patrick Monk.RN. SF. Ca.

B000SX9NAC|5.0|The first thing I need to acknowledge is that I usually hate Dance/ so called Electronic music, primarily for terribly repetitive lyrics and music that only approaches a good idea after a lot of mixed drinks. Still, when I heard \\"North American Scum\\" with it's sarcastic/ironic lyrics and catchy melodies, I was hooked. Yet it would be several more months before I would get the rest of the album. Hearing them live on the World Caf&eacute; playing \\"All My Friends\\" and other tracks made me reconsider, like \\"Get Innocuous!\\" and \\"Us V Them\\" along with Amazon's bargain price. The witty lyrics and catchy music make this an outstanding listen. This is the perfect album to drive around with as well as work out to and yes, even dance to.
B000002U82|2.0|This is not a rock album. This is a sad,maudlin effort that has enjoyed the benefit of mass hypnosis. It's not really bad, but, it was just a group of young people trying to tell us about life that they hadn't experienced yet. It sounds mostly like teenage angst. I'm sure the halucinogens they were using had stunted their emotional growth and made them think they were being profound. Either that or they knew what they were doing and the jokes on us.
B0013BNY2Q|3.0|Somewhere around the turn of the century, R.E.M. got scared. They were losing fans, their album sales declined, and their status of superstardom was starting to dull. Rather than just take it on the chin and follow their own muse, they exuded much effort to win back their fan base. The last ten or so years have been quite a struggle for R.E.M. and I really do feel bad for them. Which is why I wish they would just do what want to do. \\"Accelerate\\" is an album that R.E.M. felt they had to make rather than wanted to make. The lack of sincerity is palpable.    It's nice to hear R.E.M. loosen up. \\"Accelerate\\" negates \\"Around the Sun\\" in almost every way, which is nice. The only thing they didn't fix was the material. You can chop your songs down to two minutes, push the tempo and crank the guitars as loud as you want; that does not guarantee a superior album. And Michael Stipe still can't find a decent melody if you gave him a map.    Right out of the gate, \\"Living Well Is the Best Revenge\\" feels like a deliberate rewrite of \\"Bad Day.\\" As they approach the chorus I find myself anticipating Michael Stipe to sing \\"Broadcast me a joyful noise...\\" My wife, who has been an R.E.M. fan since her high school days, is frequently bothered by the amount of recycling going on inside of \\"Accelerate.\\" If listening to an album is that distracting in such a capacity, then go back to the drawing board...again.    \\"Accelerate\\" isn't all quite as pale as that. \\"Horse to Water,\\" \\"I'm Gonna DJ,\\" and to a certain extent \\"Hollow Man\\" don't have traceable precedents in the R.E.M. back catalog. However, every time I hear \\"Until The Day Is Done\\" all I can think of is either \\"Swan Swan H.\\" or \\"Try Not to Breathe.\\" If R.E.M. would buckle down and make an album out of the aforementioned songs, that would be some honest acceleration.    But the whole shebang got oversold. People spent too much time talking about a \\"return to form,\\" a phrase I severely hate. Pop/rock bands need to move forward, not regress. All R.E.M. is doing is sprinting towards the past.
B000002HGD|5.0|I cannot put this album down. Moby released it in the 90s, but it resonates loudly, even today.  Moby's talent is obvious here.  I recommend it highly.
B0007VCZ50|5.0|Let's face it. If you buy this DVD you are interested in Sting. You get alot more but as other reviewers have said it is not a full concert video nor a full flavor of the transformation of the songs. But you will get a very interesting look at Sting as he left the Police and went out on his own. Every Sting fan should see this.
B00000J6AG|5.0|This is the album that got me hooked on Moby. I've been a fan ever since.  It goes without saying, I recommend it very highly.
159562015X|3.0|This stuff is nothing new. It's the same old personality trait test reworked and reworded. Whether you take this, a myers-briggs test, or some other personality test, you'll learn what your personality is like. It's pretty common sense that extroverted people annoy introverted people. That one personality trait can compliment or cause conflicts with someone else's trait. That said, I wouldn't discourage someone from buying this if they needed to take a personality test. Just don't waste your money if you've already taken a different test such as a myers-briggs.
0061251305|5.0|There is a tidal wave of Leadership and How To's out there on the market.  Having read most of the best sellers, this book stands out as one that will have a lasting effect on how Leaders and Managers think of their mission.  I particularly enjoyed the development of the levels/stages of teams.  The sought after level five is where history is made and teams see beyond their current task.  When you get right down to it, it is about legacy.  Are you enriching the lives of others or not?  The authors cleverly use real life case studies that give us a guidepost on just how to make this a reality in our own lives and businesses.    I plan to keep this one close to my desk and refer back to it many times.  It is an excellent teaching and coaching tool for developing effective teams.
0747593779|5.0|It's a long time since a book made me feel angry and want to jump into the pages to defend the characters but that's how this novel made me feel. I found it a really gripping read with depth and realism that made me reluctant to put it down.<br /><br />I confess to knowing very little about Afghanistan and whilst I'm certainly no expert now, I do feel I have much more of a flavour of the country and it's people. It's easy for me to be indignant and say what I would do in certain situations but in reality, and as this novel shows, there are so many factors that go into making decisions that are life changing. Frustrated as I felt at times at the unfairness of things, I can understand why Mariam and Laila went along with the paths that were offered them.<br /><br />I was genuinely shocked by the way the women and children are treated by some of the characters, oddly enough less by the physical abuse and more of the mental abuse and inequality.<br /><br />I was impressed that religion doesn't actually play a big part in this book, instead it's an insight into Afghanistan culture over the last three decades.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|A 10-year hiatus is enough to make even the most optimistic fan doubtful. Portishead decided to stop making music together back in the late nineties, so it's hard to believe that there were many people out there holding out hope for a comeback by the time the band started to reemerge in 2005. But now, basically 11 years after their last studio album was released, the trip hop pioneers have been gracious enough to give us another fantastic album; whether we were expecting it or not.<br /><br />From the very beginning, long time fans will notice that Third has a very different feel from their previous two albums. The album begins with a seemingly insignificant soundbite of a man speaking in Portuguese. He speaks of the Wiccan \\"Rule of Three,\\" which is similar to the \\"golden rule\\" in Christianity or Karma in Eastern religions. Essentially it means that any energy put out by a person will be returned to him, be it good or bad. The lyrics of the song reflect this cyclical idea. Beth moans in the song's chorus, \\"Did you know when you lost?/ Did you know when I wanted?/ Did you know what I lost?/ Did you know what I wanted?\\" It is a haunting way to reintroduce yourself to the world, but in many ways its sets the tone for Third.<br /><br />On \\"Hunter,\\" a neo-noir masterpiece, Beth's vocals float hauntingly over acoustic guitars and a jazz kit. In the chorus, Beth coldly questions, \\"And if I should fall/ would you hold me?/ Would you pass me by?\\" The song breaks down several times with a jarring 4-note synth line that serves to add to the song's already frightening nature. \\"Nylon Smile\\" is more in line with Portishead of old, with a very cool reverse-synth line that carries throughout the song's 3 1/2 minutes. Beth sings of self-doubt and her need to change into someone that she can stand. She sings, \\"I struggle with myself/ hoping I might change a little/ hoping that I might be/ someone I want to be.\\" It's a beautiful song despite its depressing subject matter.<br /><br />\\"The Rip\\" is a personal favorite of mine, being the first song on the album that got stuck in my head. In the song's first half, Beth sings, \\"Wild white horses/ they will take me away/ and the tenderness I feel/ will send the dark underneath/ Will I follow?\\" over a simple acoustic guitar and what sounds like an oboe in the distance. Those lyrics are gorgeous, people. Also gorgeous is then the acoustic guitar that is soon replaced with a moog-ish synth sound. It's one of the album's cooler moments and I can't get enough of it!  It's followed by \\"Plastic,\\" a less poppy, darker affair.  Its chorus is complemented by bombastic drums and a thick electronic buzz-saw of a bass.  The production here is incredible, taking seemingly incompatible parts and making them sound fluid and natural.<br /><br />\\"We Carry On\\" takes a bass-heavy, industrial beat and carries it throughout its length, adding in sketchy guitars and minimalist drums as it progresses.  It's one of Third's most memorable songs, if only for its persistence.  Where other songs tend to be somewhat reluctant, this one charges out of the gate and never lets up, forcing the listener to perk up and listen intently.  \\"Deep Water\\" is the album's only \\"upper.\\"  Featuring nothing but a ukulele and vocals, it is a hopeful song about overcoming adversity.  Beth sings in a childlike whimper, \\"I'm drifting in deep waters/ alone with my self doubting again/ try not to struggle this time/ for I will weather the storm.\\"  It's one of my favorite songs on Third, mostly because it's a glimmer of hope in an album that is as bleak as they come.<br /><br />\\"Machine Gun,\\" the album's first single, features a commanding drum loop and Beth's haunting vocals almost exclusively.  Beth is left to harmonize with herself, and the end result is truly affecting.  Still, the song can get a bit repetitive by the time the haunted house synths come in at the 4-minute mark.  It's a decent song, to be sure, but there is better on Third.  Case in point: \\"Small,\\" the album's longest and most chilling track.  It starts out softly, with Beth crooning, \\"If I remember the night that we met/ tasted a wine that I'll never forget/ open the doorway and saw through the light / motions of movement, and I felt alive.\\"  It slowly builds, adding an upright bass and harmonies before busting out with one of the album's trip-hoppiest chord progressions.  After several minutes of uptempo grooves, the instrumentation once again drops out, leaving only the bass and vocals.<br /><br />\\"Magic Doors\\" gives the albums one of its catchier tunes, and it's one of the few that I can even picture myself singing along to.  It features Third's most upfront arrangement, with lush instrumentation throughout, including, a steady drum beat, synths, a piano, and bass.  It's a great song, and a wonderful change of pace.  The band slows things back down for the closer, however, and it's simply stunning!  \\"Threads\\" is a song that is brilliantly arranged, with nothing feeling excessive or lacking.  It changes pace unpredictably, and features Beth's best vocal performance on the album - possibly ever!  The moment comes at about the 4:05 mark when Beth begins singing with every ounce of her being.  To be honest, the first time I listened to  Third, I wasn't that impressed with Beth's vocals.  I felt like she spent too much time trying to sound like a floaty witch, even when the music didn't require it.  But this one moment completely negated my concerns, and made me realize just what she was trying to accomplish with her vocal stylings.<br /><br />If Third could be described in a single word, that word would be \\"claustrophobic.\\" From the very beginning to it's amazing conclusion, Third is an album that exudes hopelessness and despair. Listening to it, I can't help but close my eyes and picture the band playing inside of a tiny cell, desperately longing to be free.  There are glimpses of hope - beams of light shining through a tiny cell window - but the overall mood that is conveyed with Third is incredibly bleak.  As such, many of the more radio-friendly sides of Portishead have been shed to make way for a sound that is much more raw, more emotional and real. Whether this album is even definable as \\"trip hop\\" is debatable. I have heard the term \\"torture chamber pop,\\" applied too, which is definitely headed in the right direction. As it stands though, Third is a difficult album to define, and Portishead should be credited with that.  It is an album whose technical merits are outdone only by the emotional shadow that it casts on its listener.  It is unlike anything I've ever had the pleasure of hearing, and it is a journey that absolutely needs to be experienced!<br /><br />Key Tracks:<br />1. \\"Hunter\\"<br />2. \\"The Rip\\"<br />3. \\"Deep Water\\"<br />4. \\"Magic Doors\\"<br />5. \\"Threads\\"<br /><br />9 out of 10 Start chilling track.

B0000AUHPK|5.0|I received this video quickly and much to my surprise.  It is a good movie which really helped me to understand the book better.
B0013BNY2Q|1.0|I was really disappointed in the CD. The only song I liked was Supernatural Superserious and maybe Hollowman. The rest were horrible. I was expecting a return to the old REM and it was'nt at all. I did not like it at all. I will think twice before buying another REM CD these days.
1594489505|4.0|Before reading this book, I knew absolutely nothing about Afghanistan, its people, its culture, or its government except what I had heard in 45-second blurbs on the news after 9/11.<br /><br />I've read the negative reviews and didn't find those claims to hold true for me.  On the contrary, I felt that the author did a fine job of portraying the plight of the protagonists without demeaning them or painting them as pitiful or pathetic.<br /><br />I thought the story was very, very touching... very moving.  I also found the story left me wanting to know more about this country, its people, its culture, its government.<br /><br />It's nice when fiction is set in reality.  I look forward to reading The Kite Runner soon.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because Steinbeck's East of Eden is my benchmark and this book didn't come close enough.
B0016HMYEQ|2.0|Yes, I think Paramount is worried.  After just watching JJ Abrams \\"Cloverfield\\", I see why they have delayed the opening of the new Star Trek movie.  Wow!  What a dissapointment this movie was.  I was never hooked into the idea that these people decide to document their evening of terror.  If this is a sampling of the new Hollywood wonder boy Paramount might want to consider going back to the drawing board before a real icon is trashed.  Where can I go to get my 14 bucks back?

0316010669|3.0|Gladwell does great in 1st and 2nd gears, however his premise never really gets rolling. He fails to bring the whole idea together of any formula for the idea of thin slicing. He merely says it exists, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. In another place, he says with rare profundity that it tends to work more with monumental decisions and less with incidental decisions, but even then he's rather vague about it.    The whole concept is highly fascinating, though all we get from this book are bits and pieces. A book needs a measure of coagulation.    One example of fuzzy reasoning in the book was the part about how a man's height makes people treat them differently to a significant degree. Gladwell cites a survey of CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, indicating that 58% of them are six feet or taller, while among the general U.S. population, only 14% are six feet or taller. He concludes that boards of directors are biased toward the tall. One problem here that Gladwell overlooks is that a more likely explanation for the phenomenon is that tall people feel more confident about themselves and assert themselves more, as well as other genetic considerations. But Gladwell's answer to everything is discrimination, which is a short-sighted approach.    I did gain valuable insight from the incidents and studies mentioned. It's just that there's a critical chapter missing, namely a conclusive conclusion. So now how do we apply these ideas, Mr. Gladwell? I sincerely hope this is not a cliffhanger for the next book.    In a study this promising, I want a discussion that gets past 2nd gear. This reminds me of a classroom lecture where the instructor leaves out significant parts and gives the class an assignment to figure out the answers for themselves. Not having the luxury of raising our hands and having things clarified, it's incumbent upon Mr. Gladwell to give a more specified and in-depth outline for us to follow. I came away feeling very incomplete.
B00177Y9ZM|3.0|Being a huge Star Wars fan, I decided to see Anakin and Mace aka Hayden and Samuel in a new sci fi movie. The terrible reviews this film received prior to it's release didn't dissuade me in the least because everyone has different opinions. I found Jumper to be well made, with excellent visual effects and great worldly locations. The actors looked good and did well with what they were given. It's insane action sequences are followed by some slower 'talky' moments, that move the film along through to it's short end, with what looks like a sequel set-up. I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel that touches on some backstory of the 'jumpers' and 'paladins'. If you want to see a boring critics darling, good for you, but, if like me, you like thrilling action, neat stunts and fast paced sci-fi thrillers, this is your ticket.
B0013SJ44Q|4.0|HISTORY:<br />With the groundwork of his first two albums behind him, \\"Pain In My Heart\\" in 1964 and \\"The Great Otis Redding Sings Soul Ballads\\" in early 1965, Otis Redding stepped into the Stax recording studio on McLemore Avenue in Memphis on the 9th of July 1965 to quickly slap down his 3rd album. And quick was the optional word. In one long adrenalin fuelled session (broken up by night gigs the band had to attend - only to reconvene in the early hours of the morning), its 11 songs took less than 24 hours to produce. In fact, Otis flew out of Memphis the very next day to do another gig! It is of course now recongnised as a bona-fide 60ts soul classic and this \\"Collector's Edition\\" is here to celebrate that.<br /><br />TOM DOWD was the Engineer, ISAAC HAYES, JIM STEWART and DAVID PORTER were the Producers and the Stax House Band were the session players:<br />WAYNE JACKSON and GENE \\"BOWLEGS\\" MILLER on Trumpets<br />ANDREW LOVE on Tenor Sax<br />FLOYD NEWMAN on Baritone Sax<br />ISAAC HAYES and BOOKER T. JONES on Keyboards<br />STEVE CROPPER on Guitar<br />DONALD \\"DUCK\\" DUNN on Bass<br />AL JACKSON, JR. on Drums<br />EARL SIMS on Backing Vocals<br />(Jones, Cropper, Dunn and Jackson, Jr make up the nucleus of Booker T. & The MG's)<br /><br />\\"Otis Blue/Otis Redding Sings Soul\\" was released in the USA on the 15th of September 1965 on Volt 412. It charted on the Pop Albums chart at a lowly number 75, but hit the big number 1 spot on the R'n'B LP chart of that month. It was released in the UK in February 1966 on Atlantic ATL 5041, originally in Stereo only - but later re-issued in 1967, again on Atlantic, but this time in both Mono and Stereo (587 036 for Mono and 588 036 for Stereo). Any sixties variant of the vinyl album has always been hard to find in playable condition here in the UK - and pricey too - so this 2CD Rhino \\"Collector's Edition\\" released on Monday 28 April 2008 in a welcome addition for soul fans everywhere.<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />It has the same specialist gatefold digipak packaging that Universal's 2CD \\"Deluxe Edition\\" series and EMI's 2CD \\"Collector's Edition\\" sets have - all wrapped up in an outer titled slipcase. There's a 16-page booklet with detailed liner notes by ROB BOWMAN who has conducted interviews with the album's engineer, the late TOM DOWD, Bass Player DONALD \\"DUCK\\" DUNN and Trumpeter WAYNE JACKSON among others. It pictures US Volt 7\\" singles and UK Atlantic 7\\" singles from private collectors, has a few black and white shots of Otis himself and detailed session notes.

Otis Redding `live' must have been an awesome wonder to behold - you can only imagine what it must have been like to be in that audience - to see this force of nature literally slay an audience - and you get a sense of it 30 seconds into \\"Shake\\". It explodes out of the speakers in that Sixties joyful way. The silver suit, the huge charisma, the guttural vocals, the band complimenting him - brass section choppy and tight - guitar, bass and drums funky as f**k - what a wow! In some respects, the live versions are far better than the studio ones `because' they're so `alive'. The live tracks are ballsy and far better recorded than you would imagine - they also give you a more rounded picture of the man and his talents - and to some degree - what all the fuss about Redding is all about.<br /><br />The Stereo mix on Disc 2, however, is disappointingly drenched in hiss - and on the slower ballads like \\"Ole Man Trouble\\", the Sam Cooke cover of \\"Change Gonna Come\\", the William Bell song \\"You Don't Miss Your Water\\", the Smokey Robinson & The Miracles cover \\"My Girl\\" and particularly \\"I've Been Loving You Too Long\\" - it detracts way too much from the magic of the songs. Personally I find them very difficult to enjoy with a wall of hiss blasting out `over' the instruments. The hip shakers like Solomon Burke's \\"Down In The Valley\\", Sam Cooke's \\"Shake\\" and the Rolling Stones \\"Satisfaction\\" fare far better - they sound great - really alive and kicking - with the wonderful low-down groove of B.B. King's \\"Rock Me Baby\\" being a particular highlight (has a wicked Steve Cropper guitar solo).  Basically the effect on the stereo mix is that brass and piano are in the left speaker with the vocals and guitar entirely in the right with some imaging in between.  It works brilliantly on the mid-tempo Sam Cooke cover \\"Wonderful World\\" too. And when I A/B the 1992 remaster by Rhino with this 2008 version, the differences are there - much LOUDER and CLEARER. It's just such a shame about the hiss levels on some of the tracks.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />A classic album in a lovely package and one that fans will have to own.

It's just such a shame about the hiss levels on some of the tracks.     SUMMARY:  A classic album in a lovely package and one that fans will have to own. For those not wanting to fork out the near £15 price tag the hard copy commands, ITunes is offering the entire 40-track double set for £8.99 as a download (no booklet unfortunately).
B0000VCZK2|2.0|I haved played a number of the disks. Some skips on a few. Overall the price was good but quality is still suspect.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Ok.. I was really worried that Hard Candy will dissapoint me and will show Madonna trying to follow mainstream music and let go of her own identity and re-invention... I WAS PROVED WRONG!    This Album surprisingly showed me how Madonna no matter whom she worked with... She gets things done her way! She makes Producers not they Make Madonna... Madonna really proved with this effort that she is still in the dance pop Genre and hopefully will always be..     Infact, this album is more danceable than 'Confessions on a dancefloor'  and its still Pop only with Heavier beats added to it.      'CANDY STORE' is the first song here and it sounds more like an intro to the Album.. the song is 'sweet and raw' as Madonna claims.     '4 MINUTES' offcourse is one of the albums highlights and Maybe the best candy here.    'GIVE IT 2 ME' has a killer beat.. really reminds me of madonna's first album... this song will surely be an ultimate club hit.    'HEARTBEAT' WOW. For Years Madonna didnt give us such song that you can really call POP. very much like luckystar ..    'MILES AWAY'... Accoustic song about loving a person when he's far away..  Really good song that can be a single.    'SHE'S NOT ME' Has this 70's beat to it. You cant like this song without high volume.    'INCREDIBLE' First i didnt like this song but it grew on me... maybe coz it's lengthy (6.18) so it needs time to digest... Very original beat here.    'BEAT GOES ON' This song is nothing to what was leaked last summer. the beat and lyrics are so different you cant compare. Kanye West appears on this too. 80's club Beat make this song a Sure HIT in the clubs. one of th albums best offerings.    'DANCE 2NIGHT' This song is realy cool and it features justin.. very sweet music and really good to dance tonight.    'SPANISH LESSON' I really like this song but its too short! it's style really reminds me of Gwen Stefani's.    'DEVIL WOULDN'T RECOGNISE YOU' Recalls 'Cry Me A River' but even Better...  This song is a single worthy song.. it has the word 'HIT' written all over.    'VOICES' The final track is a dark song with church bells added to it. Madonna and Justin Timberlake questioning 'who is the master and who is the slave?'    Well for what i know after hearing the album... Madonna is certainly the master.  Everyone worried that this album wont be as good as 'confessions' You are wrong. It will really exceed your expectations...  Madonna gave 12 songs that are realy sweet, pop, danceable, sexy and above all EAR CANDY.     No Kabbalah teachings, No Motherhood issues, No adoption process stories appear in this cool offering from her Madjesty. JUST CANDY to make your day Happy.
