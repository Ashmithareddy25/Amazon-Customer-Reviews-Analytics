B009KEN87O|5.0|This is a fun game.  It reminds me of Space Invaders, Galaga and other arcade games from the 1980's.  It play great on my Kindle Fire HD.
1401307787|5.0|This book is one that I will treasure.  Each time I read it, it provides more insight.  Kabat-Zinn<br />Is a beautiful writer.  His choice of words is a gift to the reader.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I give this game 5stars. the graphics were great. it has an interesting plot and I like the interactions within the story. this game also has a bonus game that involves Jim that is fantastic.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Who loves you pretty baby?<br />This song can always make me smile on my worse day.<br />..........come to me, baby you'll see =)
B005Q1W10A|5.0|One of the best mini series ever.  The acting is superb and the story line is well written.  Once I began watching, it was hard to leave it for later, so we watched most of it at one sitting . . .
B004CFAWK2|5.0|Wonderful!  Hard to put down. I was sad when it ended and will read it again. Have shared with all my friends too.
B004M3GDI4|3.0|Its bright and will take a beating, but its on the heavy side.  I bought it and the Black Diamond Storm to use on a sailing trip.  I thought the Petzl would be better with the waterproof over the water resistant Black Diamond.  I used the Black Diamond the whole trip because its lighter, more comfortable, has adjustable brightness and the red light was great for night vision.  I think the Petzl is better suited for caving or rock climbing.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|this game is awesome and i even play it all day its very addictive and challenjing but i think its cool
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Good lord<br />How much more dithering and dallying must we read while G Martin ekes out his words and regurgitates the same drivel we've read time and time again?<br />Every chapter borrows immense tracts from the previous chapters about the subject. Very little new has happened, and I find myself at the end of another disappointing book.<br /><br />How many books does he thinks he needs to write to make more money?<br /><br />Please Mr Martin, get back to the tight and interesting and evocative story telling of your first three books, because since then you've just been going up,your own b*m, and you're taking an awfully long time about it.<br /><br />Erich
B009KEN87O|5.0|brings back fond memories of when both the times and the games were simpler.  lots of fun. graphics are perfect for the type of game.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The trilogy kept me at the edge of my seat!!! I would recommend to anyone up for a thrill!! Fantastic!!
B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|Fun game to play...plays exactly as it should...you have to get used to using the controls of the kindle but once you do it works great.
B00275EGX8|4.0|Awesome movie totally loved the awesome movie like totally dude you gotta see this flick its freaking awesome bro bro
0545265355|5.0|Totally absorbing - the world created by Suzanne Collins in her trilogy is credible throughout. I was entranced, and like very many others I read all three titles back to back for a complete Katniss overload!
B0042AGN7I|5.0|you have to see this movie if you never have especially in blu-ray it is an amazing watch and so real
B00785P2QC|5.0|its very good game and very addictive I like it a lot and it doesn't take long to load great
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I couldn't put it down. Definitely buy it if you are looking for a good read!! Will read more from this author :)
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I was disappointed when I saw the note from Google that it would stop its Reader service as I had been using it for years and become accustomed and comfortable with the way it works. Following a story on the Lifehacker blog for alternative readers brought me to Feedly - and I'm so happy it did! Feedly automatically synchronised my Google Reader feeds and presented them in a format I was comfortable with. Presentation on the Kindle Fire HD and my PC are great. It's more impressive than Google's Reader and I wish I'd moved over to it earlier.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|We have been waiting to watch this again since seeing it in the Theater. I am astounded by the actors and the music. You absolutely cannot go wrong with this purchase.
B00BRR66SA|1.0|Mr Timberlake limits himself by sticking to one producer on this album. Some of the songs sound the same and some sound like songs from his previous albums. In short the creative range is lacking. It's not news to anyone that Mr. Timberlake's vocal range is limited but the production on his previous albums has always been innovative. This album may be okay to play once with a few singles deserving more repeated play for light occasions. Maybe that's the intent of the artist and if so it's still mediocre. Its not worth it.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Awesome show!!!! The characters drive the show with their struggle for power and the Iron Throne.  Season 3 is going to be even better!
B00899ES5C|5.0|I ordered this series because I would keep forgetting what night it was on TV or which channel it came on and I would miss it. So I watch them on the weekends instead. I am a older woman and thought this might be to young and I would not be interested in it but I am hooked on Pretty Little Liars. It has so many twists and turns in it. Just when you think you have it figured out something different changes your mind. Love it!!!!
B007FEFLTO|3.0|The characters seemed more one dimensional than in the first book.  And it read bit like a history book, lurching from one historical event to the other.  It did hold my interest but not in a &#34;page turner, can't wait &#34; manner.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|An amazing story about those who dedicate their lives to keeping America free and safe. Maya's focus and dedication to her mission is inspiring. As those around her succumb to political pressure or are eliminated by assassins she only redoubles her efforts and determination to the effort to find UBL. The seals who must enter the compound and find Bin Ladin are shown in the difficulty of their task. They must avoid killing women and children without exposing themselves to the brutality of the men in the compound. I appreciated the detail shown such as the townspeople coming to the compound to see what was happining. I had not thought about what was going on there in Islamabad when the raid took place. There is danger, intellegence, politics, courage, and all in a story that really happened. God Bless America and those who keep it free. Could I have been brave enough?
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Almost as good as my bejeweled games on the computer.  Great graphics.  My kindle fire does it proud, the colors are wonderful and the jewels are easy to touch.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|super fun, and easily navigated. my neice, who rides,  cant get enough of it! the graphics are good, and we havnt experienced a glitch yet. kid friendly, and enjoyable.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Here Susan Boyle teamed up with Donny Osmond & the entire recording was very good.
B009ZUKY52|5.0|Music creation is a hobby of mine, and I love the ability to play melodies or just test out synths, etc on a keyboard.<br /><br />This keyboard is great because the various knobs and sliders can be configured to almost anything in most music programs.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for a reasonably priced, solid midi controller/keyboard.
B0060MYM7O|3.0|I notice that this version is like half the price of the \\"complete season\\" version, does this include all the episodes? Why is it half the price?
B008SOS63S|5.0|This is the first time i have listen to his music and it was great. I have never heard of him before.
B009X01ELC|5.0|Easy to install and use.  Much nicer than others I've used on iPad.  The slots make it easy too prop and read in either landscape or portrait.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game, been playing for a few weeks and can't put it down. Simple enough to be addictive but difficult enough to keep you playing. Good stuff.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|enjoyable from beginning to end, there is something everyone can relate to from the 20 plus crowd to the 40 plus, a deffinite must see !!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game has it all, hidden object, problem solving and a good story line. The graphics are amazing and game play is just hard enough that it doesn't frustrate.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book. It's good in most parts but rarely the book gets boring. I would recommend this book to anyone who loved the others.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My 5 year old loves to play this game. It took her a little to get the hang of it though. The graphics and sound is great but I wish she could earn more diamonds.
B00336G7HI|5.0|i like it. useful. it is a good battery. have a long working time. and it is not expensive. so
B00006RCNJ|5.0|I had never seen a performance from the Royal Albert Hall and just a great experience.  Just like I was there.  Thoroughly enjoyed the performance.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|nice script and good acting, not usually a fan of this type of movie but it was worth the time.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Interesting and deserving of the critical accolades and awards. I would watch it again but then I'd need to rent it again.
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|The absolute worst of all the DIE HARD movies...and I loved the first 4.<br /><br />Story that makes no sense other to twist and turn,hyper direction and bruce looks like he didnt want to be there.<br /><br />The joy and humor is lost. There are complete action sequences that are cut together that also make no sense. A 15 minute car chase...I dare you to follow what th hell is going on.<br /><br />Remember how exciting the firt one was? well, this is the polar opposite of that in every way. we saw this in the theatre and we almost left a couple of times.<br /><br />This is Hollywood film making at it worst and is a horrible money grab. This movie did nothing but kill the franchise in my eyes.<br /><br />I want to believe that there is a ton of footage on the cutting room floor that did not make it to the film...how else do you explain a exchange in a cab where we never see the cabbie again?<br />How are we suppose to buy the idea that his own dad doesnt know his son is working for the government?<br /><br />Maybe there will be a directors cut that explains all this...but the movie i saw was not good.<br /><br />This movie mad me sad. I wanted to like it. I even went in with low expectations.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Interesting look inside of Germany during WW II; moving characters and story line; unusual, but compelling writing style. Will recommend.
B0053O8ARI|4.0|Stupid quick fun. great cast and some edgy humor that keeps me coming back for more. I really enjoy the show.
0385349947|5.0|For the life of me, I can't understand all of the negativity that's being cast on this book. I read all kinds of books about all types of things and I don't ever remember deciding that the person writing the book was too privileged to be able to teach me anything. In some ways, the detractors prove Sheryl's point. Men seeking to climb the corporate ladder don't sit around and talk about how Donald Trump, Warren Buffet and George Soros are too privileged to be able to understand their plight. It's just plain silly.<br /><br />Sheryl doesn't claim her book to be for everyone, but it was definitely exactly what I needed to hear. If it's not for you, fine. But don't criticize the woman because she decided to tackle real issues that prominent women have been silent on for years. Thank you Sheryl Sandberg. You're my hero.
B009OCR1X4|5.0|Lush, deep,  beautiful crisp sound that complimented the film. I love this soundtrack , its one of my new favorites.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Cool time passer. Keeps. Your mind off things. One thing that needs changed is large hill in beginning needs to be cheaper.  Sets the challenges off balance as its there forvever untill u get the resources
B002BIULQ2|1.0|i couldnt take anymore after the first 30. this must appeal to little girls but it hurts when 'girls' try to b cutsy sugar sweet whatever, eh! give ma an action flick or something fast!! this dvd will go in the used to be sold pile along with the other 291 copies for sale!
B000JQU1VS|5.0|it was great  I love mysteries and this had plenty.  Read it on my Kindel and it was convenient and easy.
B005OT2YVA|2.0|The human characters are so incredibly lame that they ruin the movie, none worse than the main character and his parents.
B003PTP4S6|5.0|These two were made to make music together and this CD confirms that.  However, there is one annoying thing about this cd and that is that some tracks have no gap and other tracks seem to almost run into each other.  This would appear to be a musical/producer decision and not a technical flaw or problem.  CD is worth every penny no matter the price.  This CD most assuredly does not disappoint.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Very addicting, I got it and then got my husband addicted! Glad we picked it up on it's free day!
B008N9AAQ4|4.0|For those familiar with Baraka, and the eye-popping boldness of that film, Samsara makes that look like a DVD movie..  The colors and resolution are simply jaw dropping.  Once you get your jaw off the floor after the opening scenes you can enjoy lush colors, detail, and 7.1 sound. In one scene with monks building a mandala you can see each grain of sand.  I have a Panasonic plasma and watching this at night with all the lights off is a tour-de-force in this type of film making.  Bravos to all who put this together.  The only 'bad' thing about this movie is finding it at a good price.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a well written, story with plenty of twists in the plot that makes it hard to put down at any point. Unfortunately is about a group of self-centered people I could car less about.
B000000OE7|5.0|A beautiful album and wonderful tribute to Freddie Mercury.  Songs are deep.  Glad to add it to my Queen collection.
0380730405|5.0|\\"Moonlight can play odd tricks upon the fancy, even upon a dreamer's fancy. As I stood there, hushed and still, I could swear that it was not an empty shell but lived and breathed as it had lived before.\\"<br /><br />Rebecca has become one of my favorites, with its heavy atmosphere and setting, mood, its building suspense and tension, and its slowly but effectively told plot. While reading I was reminded of Bronte's Jane Eyre, as it has many similar elements and qualities. However, I think that the biggest difference lay in the main protagonist. Jane is clearly the star of Bronte's novel, showing a strength, resolve and independence that is admirable. Here, in Rebecca, it's not any one person, but Manderley itself that holds influence over all. No, not the mousy narrator, nor ghostly Rebecca, nor sinister Mrs. Danvers, not even complicated, brooding Maxim hold more power than Manderley. Manderley creeps into the conscience of all, having a life of its own. It is a symbol of all the mystery within the novel.<br /><br />The plot is not complicated, yet the mysteries that come to the surface make it entertaining, and the author does an excellent job of withholding key information to keep us guessing. A young, inexperienced, naïve, young woman marries Maxim De Winter, a mysterious man whose wife had died a year earlier. Stepping into grand Manderlay, our unnamed narrator is clearly in over her head. Within her own mind, she has an overly romanticized image of what life and marriage will be like within these walls. In truth, she barely knows Maxim, and certainly doesn't know the many other secrets that surround the estate. Manderley is an immense residence, a sprawling estate, and Maxim's new wife, who comes from a humble, lower class background, is overwhelmed with her new role. She must learn how to manage the place, entertain guests, be the proper host, and, in short, be the new Mrs. De Winter. These are big shoes, indeed, though and she is constantly reminded that sheisn't the other Mrs. De Winter. She's no Rebecca, seems to be the whispered word from the servants and guests. As Maxim's sister Beatrice reminds the new Mrs. De Winter, \\"you are so very different from Rebecca.\\" For Rebecca De Winter is seemingly more alive than dead, and makes her presence felt. As the narrator tries to adjust to her new life, she learns more about Maxim, Rebecca, and the many secrets from years past.<br /><br />Another place where De Mauerier excels is in the timing and pacing. What would a Gothic, atmospheric story be without key, unforeseen and unexpected shifts and twists? There are a few key shifts that throw us off a bit and come unexpected. Things aren't always exactly as they seem; neither are people. There's also a level of ambiguity about the passage of time and the world between life and death. This is especially evident when the narrator explores the very rooms that Rebecca lived in, the very clothes that she wore, the bed she slept in, even the notebook that she wrote in. It seems that Rebecca is all around.<br /><br />Rebecca is simply an amazing novel, and a definite read for a rainy, dreary, cold night by the fireside. Also, there is an excellent film version done by Hitchcock (although the plot is altered somewhat).<br /><br />Definitely recommended!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter and she loves it. It's a really cute movie about sisters. We haven't seen any of the other Tinkerbell movies though, so I'm not sure how it compares to the others.
B00979CS50|4.0|If you are a fan of Neil Young you will probably like this album.  It is his traditional run away style with Crazy Horse.  Good listen if you are a fan.
B006M9NJFG|5.0|just like all of the products Bear Grylls puts his name on, this one is good. the canteen is durable and the cup is large and sturdy.
B008EZVNO0|4.0|I like Van Morrison for the most part....good album overall.  I grew up with him on the radio so I still listen to him.
B001I45UFC|5.0|I decided to read the Chronicles of Narnia because I never read all if them before and certainly not in order from book 1 to book 7.  However, now I know that I am on a really special journey. Reading the books in order is answering questions that I only could wonder about. The characters are all that I remember and I am so glad to be travelling along on my trip through Narnia with these brave heroes. Give yourself a treat, too!
0061906220|5.0|All three grandkids love this book.  It didn't take them long to memorize it and now are reading it to me with great enthusiasm.  The grandson (age 2) calls Grandma on the phone and reads me his bedtime story.  So much fun!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I stumbled (good word-you'll see/read - eventually) across this author and this compilation of 5 Shorts. After the 1st one, I added up the $ cost of the next 4 & decided the least expensive way was 2 just get the \\"1 thru 5\\" book collection. It all has 2 do with Sci-Fi but still held my interest & captivated me like so much other than that. It is a GREAT series, & I cannot wait 2 read more of this author's work. I highly recommend the 1-5 book!<br />WOOL OMNIBUS. Silo Saga! Download it!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I enjoy the feel and challenge of the game...I highly encourage you to get it especially since it is free.
020530902X|5.0|I used to write, both in High School and in College, for the school newspapers, and this was a vital reference for everything that we did. Granted, that was prior to the internet boom and being able to find things on-line; however, I've found that I am far more productive when I move away from the computer to write, so having this on-hand is critical. This, a dictionary and a thesaurus are the key ingredients to writing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE this app because...<br />1. There are no glitches that I have cought<br />2. Great colors and graphics<br />3. Awesome power up's<br />4. Cool boards<br />5. Cool people<br />6. Great theme's<br />7. And soooo much more that it would be to much to mention<br />I think this is one of my many favorites of apps. Thank you for a great app :)
B00BI73CVI|1.0|This is not the type of movie I like long, slow at times. Couldn't understand the music and very dark and depressing.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It was kind of a fun app because...<br />1. You got to play against other people (multiplayer)<br />2. I loved teaching the horses to do tricks<br />3. The horses looked pretty real<br />But ... It got a little boring after a few minutes because there was not much to do but feed it and do races.<br />Maybe the app would be a little more fun if you could dress up your horse or groom it.<br />I think it would also be fun if you could take it places. I think this could be a really great app with just a few improvements.<br />Thank You :)
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Best way to charge the Kindle, well contstructed, adaptable.  We had an original kindle charger that was very flimsy and didn't last more than 3 months.  This one should last much longer.
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|Love this little light.  Great for tent or for power outages. Only takes 3-D battery's and just follow the directions on putting bottom of lantern on and it is very easy!  I would recommend this lantern very highly.  The the price it can't be beat!  This is my third lantern like this.  Has three bright, med or blinking light.  Also a small green light that always blinks so you can find in the dark.  My first still has the same batteries now for over two years.  Amazing!
B0007939NO|5.0|Love Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse. Definitely a classic musical! Great songs and dance scenes coupled with a unique story. I definitely recommend it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|the game subway suffers is a game that is interesting and fun and wow it amazing in so many ways
B005NFJAZS|5.0|This is my absolute favorite musical! Love the songs and the story. Shirley Jones and Robert Preston have some great chemistry between them. If you're a band kid or have played a musical instrument, you'll love this musical!
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Donald Fagan's best solo effort. I can relate to the lyrics. Can'stop listening to the CD. Art work on CD cover is awesome. If you are a Dan Fan you are going to love this one. If you are not you may be converted.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|Been looking for a reasonably priced case. As usual found it on Amazon. Holds my camera & the extras. Sincerely feel the camera is protected even though it's a light weight case.
B009LAP9JW|5.0|Chapter 22 in the Season One Victoria Grayson got on the Plane to go to Washington DC<br />What happen to them and the evidence?
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Great game, hours of fun, does take a while to build up money but that's also a good thing because it makes you play the game and take your time. Great buy
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|This is a series that I follow, as I enjoy the recurring characters and the unusual twists to the stories.  Preston and Childs do a good job with these novels. Enjoyable reading.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is the best .this the type of game that I would play all the time .<br /> fun. excitedly cool. impressive. I like the way it's set up as well. not boring. good ways to power up
B00007BKVC|4.0|It had been so many years since I had watched this film, but it was required for a college class.  Great movie, wonderful acting and a film I highly recommend.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Really addicting game! My kids get annoyed waiting for me to give them a turn with the tablet. Easy to play, which is definitely a plus when you are down to one hand  due to a sprained wrist!
B00BUAEYVK|1.0|I wanted to LOVE this movie.  Unfortunately, the folks in charge seem to have blown their special effects budget on ridiculous stunts and explosions instead of bloody makeup and a filthy T-shirt.  The first Die Hard movies were good because John McClane was mortal, albeit tough -- half the fun was watching the good guy work through the pain and win in the end.  The last movie in the franchise, \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\", strayed too far down the path towards Michael Bay-esque absurdity (semi vs. F-35, for God's sake) and, sadly, \\"A Good Day to Die Hard\\" seems to have completed that journey.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All of the 3 books keep me smiling, curious,  and wanting for more about their relationship after marriage and children<br />The emails and text were great through out the books. I was excited through out all the books and the books helped in my relationship with my husband.  Please create more books about Christian and Anastasia or others subjects of interest.  Great writing and like to read more of your creative adventures
0062060562|2.0|I only order books that say &#34;good&#34; or &#34;very good&#34; - I believe this one was &#34;good&#34; - it was not - it should have been &#34;poor&#34; or &#34;acceptable&#34; - cover bent - several pages folded over,  It is readable but I think it was advertised with the wrong condition.
B000GDH9JQ|4.0|I specifically liked the dance movements in the film.  The story line wasn't much but seeing the two very different styles of dancing<br />portrayed together was great. Seeing two masters of dance  in action was so worthwhile
0783225547|5.0|This movie is well-made. It will not disappoint. The cast is stellar, the plot is excellent, the special effects are great. The movie is taunt, thrilling, unnerving and has moments of real emotion, love, concern and bitter-sweetness. Sit back and enjoy!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Wow this game is like your taking care of a real horse. I think it is great for kids to take responsabilitie in this game so Ill give them 5 *
B009KEN87O|5.0|Harken back to the days of Space Invaders, with a modern twist. Solid game play &amp; very addictive. Nice job!
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|THE IMPOSSIBLE is one of the more viscerally gripping movies of 2012. It has enough problems to prevent me from calling it great...but it is nonetheless a \\"must-see.\\"<br /><br />The great tsunami that killed hundreds of thousands of people in 2006 was one of the greatest disasters of modern times. But as we often do, we tend to forget these things over time...but surely such an event was worthy of remembering via cinema, which is one of our greatest ways of remembering the past...imperfect though those recollections may be. When this great wave hit the coast of Thailand (and many other countries), there was literally no warning. People stood dumbfounded and amazed as an unfathomably huge wall of water wiped everything out of its path. Lives were snuffed out in an instant and dank misery was left everywhere in its wake.<br /><br />THE IMPOSSIBLE tells us just a tiny portion of this epic disaster, as seen through the eyes of one family: Henry, Maria and their 3 young sons (it's based on a true story and a real family). This is a happy, comfortably upper-middle class family that has come to the coast of Thailand over the Christmas holidays. The kids squabble a little bit, but other than this, we see no hint that this isn't a perfect family. We like them immediately during the few minutes we are allowed to get to know them. Then on December 26th, they are playing around their resort pool when suddenly they hear a loud noise. Within seconds, water is bearing down on them...and because they've had just enough time to see that this water can take down entire palm trees with nary a pause...they know they are in trouble. The only thought is to grab the kids and duck.<br /><br />Maria (Naomi Watts) is badly injured in the ensuing flood, and is briefly all alone. She reunites with her oldest son Lucas (Tom Holland) and the two of them share wretched travels together before they arrive at a hugely overcrowded and overwhelmed hospital. They believe they are the only survivors oftheir family.<br /><br />Although the trailers of the film give away much more, I hesitate to do so just in case you haven't seen them. The plot developments are very important, of course, and JA Bayona keeps the tension high. He's best known to US audiences for this Spanish ghost story THE ORPHANAGE, and he does know the value of restraint. This film is actually, remarkably, PG-13...which means much is left to the imagination. We see little gore and death (compared to what our jaded sensibilities are accustomed to), but we HEAR enough to fill in the blanks. Bayona realizes we ultimately care more about this family than we do the carnage, and he keeps his camera tight on them as they react to the horror around them. (This is not to say the movie is \\"suitable\\" for kids...but I think teens and above SHOULD see this film. It's an important piece of modern history that deserves a respectful look.)<br /><br />Three great things about this film. First, the special effects are truly special. We get huge shots of roiling waters and debris, with Watts and Hooper tossed about like tiny corks. HOW this was accomplished is beyond my understanding, but it is completely and utterly convincing. While we've certainly seen more \\"spectacular\\" destruction on films like 2112...this is the best \\"realistic-scale\\" mass destruction I've ever seen. The you-are-there feeling is pretty darn intense at times.<br /><br />Second, the attention to little details of design is great. The hospital in Thailand, for example, has a floor simply awash in fluids of the victims. The grime everywhere feels very real and icky. You understand immediately how a disaster could turn a modern, well-run hospital into a cesspool of infection and disease. (As so often happens, many survivors of the initial assault will succumb to the horrible conditions of their care.)<br /><br />Finally, the performances are first-rate. Ewan McGregor is a master of playing the nice guy, and we've seen this from him many times before. But he's got a couple of scenes where he nearly breaks down with emotion, and thus we're reminded that this guy has got serious, broad acting chops. Young Tom Holland is really special in his role...smart, scared, funny, fierce and fragile. And this works all the better, because most of his scenes are with the remarkable Naomi Watts. She gives one of the most PHYSICALLY powerful performances I've seen in ages, and certainly one of her best performances. It is through her that we feel the physical toll of this event. She gives a huge performance, but it never feels over-the-top. I've always been a fan of Watts, but we haven't seen much of her in recent years. Boy, is she back!<br /><br />There is plenty to take issue with as well. I know this is a true story...but I suspect as with all \\"true\\" stories, some liberties have been taken with the details. A few plot developments, especially near the end, have too much of a Hollywood manipulation feel to them. As though it was felt even more tension was needed, it felt like events may have been embellished. And the point of focus for this story is certainly up for debate. Is picking a lovely, affluent white couple and following them, to the almost complete exclusion of the citizens of Thailand (who surely suffered greater loss) the best way to tell this story? Certainly, it's a compelling story, but since there won't be 20 different movies about the tsunami, but perhaps only this one (yes, I know there was a TV movie that no one saw), there is a danger that history will remember this event inaccurately. THE IMPOSSIBLE is yet another example of a primarily \\"non-white\\" event seen through the eyes of white characters.<br /><br />That being said, I believe THE IMPOSSIBLE should be seen. While it isn't exactly a pleasant time at the movies, it is a well-crafted, well-acted and gripping time.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|My 2 year old daughter loves all of the Dr. Panda games!  They keep her entertained for quite a while and they are educational too!  She loves putting the groceries in the cart and I teach her the names of all the fruits and veggies.  She always wants me to play this game with her and I don't mind because it's a really cute game!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Sad, funny, violent and ultimately sad. A book I couldn't put down until I was finished. Give it a read.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wow. It was almost painful to read this yet a great comfort at the same time. I love his honesty, quirkiness, and sick humor. If you have been or are chronically ill you will GET the nuances, the sick jokes, the small asks that are big feats.

B00BSBU4EC|2.0|Amazon seems like a fantastic company to do business with but as far as their instant video quality, IT'S TERRIBLE! Every so often, we rent a movie where the streaming is so on and off again that eventually we end up leaving the room or switching on our Hulu or Netflix. We never even got to enjoy this $5 movie for a full 15 min without an interruption!!!
B00AJLHUAS|5.0|Subtle reworkings of classic tunes that bring you right to the era of Gatsby.  Magnificent musicianship and arrangements. You can't help but be enthralled!
B00BKELJZ0|5.0|I heard an interview of Hiromi on NPR. The theme for the album sounded interesting.  Apparently the songs move from a sound of an alarm clock that wakes her up in the morning, to different moods as her day progresses. The Trio works well.  I can hear slight influence of Chick Corea, but overall it is her own sound and style.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great Read. tMakes one wonder why human beings are so fallible. Can't wait to start reading book two. I want to read all his books.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is really fun I would recommend it to the fans of temple run! :) :) :) :) :)

140053271X|5.0|I Ordered two by accident didn't think the first order had gone thru. anyway on the order after writing to the seller to see if they could mail ASAP they did at no extra cost to me so my grandson got it for his birthday. On the return of the other they have been gracious and approved the return which will be mailed back today or  Monday. They have been wonderful  to work with and very kind  to a senior citizen that sometimes messes up(orders). Thank you soooo much for your kindness and my grandson loves the Nook.<br />I recommend them highly and I dont give recommendations so easily. I was a customer service rep and always prided myself at being a caring cust serv rep. Im tough on others because I want them to treat me with the same level of cust service as I did. Thank you so much for treating me as a person and not just as another order. God Bless Bianca and Carla
B007MU85D0|5.0|I always like it when I pick up something new thinking I'll like it and end up loving it.  I'm a big buyer of single songs but buying the entire MP3 album was absolutely the right thing to do on this one.

B004J4WLB4|4.0|Timing out of the foster care system will damage the most resilient soul, but an appreciation of beauty, nature, and an ancient language of a time gone by will offer the path to healing.
B004EPZ0AC|4.0|We took my 4 yr old to see this in the movies and she was not interested at all.  Didn't captivate her one bit. I did think they tried a little too hard this time around with the movie. I was reluctant and I thought, yes maybe they should have left it alone.<br />We have since watched again since On Demand and now....she can't watch it enough.  She loves it!  So I think maybe it should have been a DVD from the door.  So she loves the songs and watches it repeatedly.  If she is happy...I am happy TWO! (wink)
B0033H7VI6|4.0|This is a beast of  a knife! I waited for this to become available for a few months and finally BOOM. Great handle, sharp edge and you can carry this in the feild and use from peeling an apple to splitting small logs. I dont care for the sheath but its nice quality. I'll probably get a custom leather one made. This would be a great gift for any outdoorsman.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|This is one of the best memoirs I have ever read. Quite a page turner- I could barely put it down!<br />What an amazing life Ms. Parker has had! This book truly reads like fiction. I really feel for her; the way she describes her myriad of experiences is so crystal-clear and moving, unlike so many other memoirs that relate a timeline of events with little actual insight into the person. Exceptionally well-organized and well-written. Just wonderful!
B00BF11STU|3.0|I'd really give it about 3 1/2 stars if I could, but Amazon only lets you give full stars.<br /><br />I'm active duty military (not a Navy SEAL...I'm not that hardcore), so maybe I'm a bit more biased in my review of the movie and tend to give it a better rating than some people would.  I thought it was a decent movie but not as great as I expected.  I did get to gain an insight into how things worked in the CIA in trying to track down UBL, even though I realize this wasn't a 100% accurate depiction of the process.  I'd still venture to guess more of it was pretty true than not.<br /><br />My biggest complaint isn't about the movie itself, but rather about how horrible Amazon's Instant Video service was when we tried to watch it tonight.  I won't be watching anymore movies using this service.  In fact, I only used it to watch this one because I had a credit from a gift I bought for one of my kids at Christmas.<br /><br />Note:  My complaint about Instant Video didn't lower my rating.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|Hat's off to Dave Grohl. Well made documentary and the audience clapped and cheered at the end when seen in the theater.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|High praise for author Hugh Howey for this book and the Wool Series! I loved this series! The drama, suspense, action, characters, and dystopian world that Howey created in this series is amazing. As each installment finished, I couldn't wait to read the next. And now, having finished this first part of the series, I cannot wait to get started in the second part, Shift!

B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This is way better than the original because there are way more things you can do in this like multiplayer
B009O07NMA|5.0|As other reviewers have said, this is one of those rare albums that you can pop in and listen to from beginning to end without skipping anything in between. Florida Georgia Line combines a country sound with influences from pop, rock and even a little rap/hip-hop. As a result, all of the songs are fun and upbeat (with the exception of \\"Stay\\", the only serious song on the album), with catchy lyrics that will be stuck in your head all day. I have been listening to this almost nonstop since I bought it a few months ago. FLGAL makes me wish warmer weather would hurry up and get here so I can cruise around with my windows rolled down, blaring their music. I absolutely cannot wait to see them in May with Luke Bryan!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its so fun to play and i enjoy passing the time with it. i play it all the time. GREAT
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I have not enjoyed a series so much since &#34;I, Claudius&#34;.  The story is so complicated, with so many characters, sub plots, etc., that one has to watch it more than once to catch everything.  I like the fact that captioning is available because I have some diffictulty understanding British/Irish speech patterns. The series (and the novels) are courageous with cutting edge violence and eroticism.  Not for the squeamish, but that is all right as this reviewer is not  As far as the story goes, as soon as the viewer thinks he has it all figured out, they throw a curve.  People you thought were &#34;immortal&#34; and beloved of the author can get killed off!  All bets are OFF!  Anthing is possible. Damn him!<br /><br />I particularly like the simultaneous interviews in commentary mode.  It is fun to hear the parfticiapnts discuss how they were freezing to death in cold damp Iceland, while the cast in Croatia are having a blast enjoying Dbrovnik night life after the shoots.  Also, it is intertesting to learn that the actors who play the most despicfable creachers on screen are acturally the nicest people one would ever like to meet.  How disconcerting.<br /><br />Why is it that most of those interviewed cannot resist humming along while the title music plays?  It merely shows how greatful they all are to be involved in a career project of a liftime.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I absolutely love this game and i cant get enough of it. Its so hard to put it down. Great passtime!

B000HC2LI0|5.0|Great serie and cast. pity that in Italy has been less successful than it deserves because of the television networks.
141690977X|2.0|The advice in the book is, for the most part, good.  However, I found it unnecessary the way that Greg is portrayed as a previously \\"bad\\" guy who has somehow evolved into this infallible font of wisdom, while the women in the book (even Liz) are portrayed as giggly middle school girls.  Sure, they keep referring to themselves as \\"smart,\\" but you have to actually ACT smart to appear that way, not talk like a vapid middle schoolers and just keep SAYING you're smart.  I felt that the narration portrayed a bunch of simpering, clueless women relying on the oh-so-clever man (Greg) to help them solve their relationship woes.  Why couldn't your happily married woman-friend give the same advice?  Why did Liz come across as so pathetic and unable to think for herself?  My girlfriends don't titter and coo over guys I've dated who are bad for me, as apparently all these women's friends do--they straight up tell me the same kind of advice that's offered in the book.  Also, not only are people of both genders horribly stereotyped in this book, they're discussed as if they're different species.  The issues discussed in this book go beyond romantic relationships, since the fundamental message of \\"don't associate with people who can't act like decent human beings\\" applies to all situations.  Anyway, I guess the book was supposed to be dumbed down for \\"laypeople\\" or whatever, but I found it kind of one-dimensional and not offering any kind of real depth or intellectual content.  Also, I hope you're not someone who hangs out with shy men or who is into open relationships or anything, because the advice in this book seems to only fit if you're very mainstream in your views and behaviors.  If you seriously need a swift kick in the booty to get out of crappy relationship patterns, this may help, but try not to gag on the stereotyped portrayal of women as giggly, stupid girls who need the help of some man to sort out their personal problems.
B00BOXZAJ8|4.0|Imagine my surprise when this movie showed up this weekend out of nowhere, without any advance advertizing, on a single screen for all of Greater Cincinnati. I figured this wasn't going to play very long here so I went to see it right away.<br /><br />\\"Upside Down\\" has a very intruiging premise: there are two worlds very close together but each with their own gravity. As the movie opens, we are informed of the basic three rules: 1. All matter is pulled by the gravity of the world that it comes from, and not the other. 2. An object's weight can be offset by matter from the opposite world (inverse matter). 3. After some time in contact, matter in contact with inverse matter burns. Wow, get your head around that! As the movie opens, we see young/eventual teenagers Adam (played by Jim Sturgess) and Eden (played by Kirsten Dunst) find each other in striking distance from opposing sides of a high mountain. Adam pulls in Eden with a rope, and as Eden is hanging/resting upside down in a rock, they kiss (hello, Spiderman upside-down kiss replay, anyone?). Eventually they are found out and as Eden is trying to get back to her \\"Up\\" world, the rope is shot and she takes a bad tumble, causing amnesia. Fast forward 10 years, and by complete chance Adam (from the \\"Down\\" world) see that Eden is now working at TransWorld, the 'evil' company that controls everything. Adam is developing an \\"anti-gravity\\" matter that also serves as an \\"anti-aging\\" creme. That appeals to TransWorld and he gets hired. Adam is bent on finding Eden and reconnecting with her, even though she has no memory of him and her teenage romance with him. At this point we are not even half-way into the movie, but to tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br /><br />Several commments: first and foremost, this movie is the most visual original movie that I have seen in a long, long time. It is slightly reminiscent of \\"Inception\\" in its visuals, but then does it one or two times better than that, just outstanding. I just couldn't stop marveling at how the images of the two \\"upside down\\" worlds were presented to us. That said, I thought that Sturgess was badly miscast as Adam. Even though he is in reality older than Dunst, he just looked like a boy next to her. On the other hand, Dunst just shines in this movie, continuing her strong streak in recent movies like Melancholia and Bachelorette. Kudos also for the nice soundtrack, scored by Mark Isham, a favorite of mine. The screening that I saw this at today here in Cincinnati was poorly attended (only 2 people besides myself), so if you get a chance to see this in the theatre, do not wait, or otherwise catch it on DVD. The plot lacks some emotional pull but the visuals will win you over.hen does it one or two times better than that, just outstanding.

B0074MZSWW|1.0|First of all the cd was delivered on time and packaged well.<br />Secondly, the female vocalist has 'pipes' among the best I've heard in years. Outstanding.<br />BUT, this is possibly the worst recorded album I have heard in decades. And I own 2,000 cd's. It is painful to listen to. The company that released this POS should be ashamed of themselves. The engineers that made this album should be banned from ever working again.<br />I can only hope they get a better crew to produce and engineer their next album.
055358894X|3.0|I heard great things about this book, so i jumped into it like a fat kid in a carton of ice cream. It reads fast, and he creates a decent world for it to play out in, but there is nothing in it that makes me say wow, no moment of wow where you just have to put the book down for a moment and let your mind digest what you have just read.<br /><br />It's worth the read, buy it used if you can or check it out at a library. But by no means is it a get it signed, put it in a case and cherish it for all time type of book.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I loved this game at first. It has many different rooms and lots of players. It's also easier to get a bingo than other games I have tried.<br /><br />The downside is that near the end of a round, if a lot of people bingo around the same time it freezes not just the game but also my kindle. I have to then hold down the power button for 20 seconds to shut down my kindle. It really sucks when I am close to a bingo. This only happens to me when I am in a room with a lot of players.<br /><br />Another thing is that I have powerplays that I cannot use. The game prompts me to buy more even though I have 20. I sent in a complaint, and they told me to get the updated version which amazon does not offer.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|great movie can watch over and over never get tired of it.  Chevy chase is great as always  all his moves are great.
B006GWO5NE|3.0|Nice cord. Still has loose connection inside port of kindle, it's jiggly. Amazon needs to make port bigger inside kindle like on iPhones. So cords make a stronger connection inside.
B009X01C64|4.0|Well made,  rotating function excellent idea. Comments about not being able to plug in usb while watching movies is wrong, just rotate 180 degrees and orient plugs to the top.  Would buy again.

B00ARF93AQ|4.0|The last Dredd I saw was [[ASIN:B008C0C1Y8 Judge Dredd [Blu-ray]]] which was good in its own way. This release however takes Dredd in another direction with more grit and way more gore than the Stalone version. Slow motion helps emphasise the most gory parts in a well directed film with decent acting which isn't something you tend to find in most comic movie adaptions.<br /><br />If you don't mind seeing blood, guts, brain fragments and teeth shattering from inside the mouth and out of the cheek (yep that happens) and you like Dredd then this is a must see.

B007Y5IAV0|5.0|Serj's third solo album finally delivers what we all knew he could: high-energy, awesome music. This is less euro-poppy than his earlier albums, and the lyrics get a bit preachy, but that's to be expected. Personally, I freaking love it. I listen to it while grading tests, and find that I grade much faster with Serj's help.

B00ANGICRE|5.0|...without the slightest suggestion or hint of embarrassment by either the actors or the director.You get to see everything except a &#34;willie&#34; which is kept out of sight although that is the one thing that apparently works well! I have always liked and admired Helen Hunt as an actress and now you can be assured that she has a lovely body as well! The whole story was told on film with great sensitivity and the humour involved comes across exactly right.John Hawkes does a superb job  as the main subject of the story. Highly recommended.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I loved this book.  Heard it was not necessary yo buy the book but I disagree.  It is so informative.  I had no idea of the health bennifits.  I am really excited by what I read not just for loosing weight but becoming a healthier person

B00985E3UG|5.0|I give kudos to this author.  I just can't stop reading this book.  Usually I'm reading fiction books on my Kindle and I have a non-fiction book or two that I look at every once in a while. Currently I am choosing this book every time I open my Kindle.  It's so well written and easy to read.  Mr. Moss is an amazing storyteller.  I am learning so much and I am so greatful for his research - it's truly amazing how in depth it is.  But that's not the best thing - it's how the author tells the tale.  It's such an easy book to read - and you wouldn't think it would be.  I think this book should be required reading for everyone today.  It is infuriating to learn how the industry folks, including big tobacco, have duped all of us but at the same time, but at the same time we can learn from history to not let it continue.  This book is a way to help everyone understand the issue and come to their own conclusion.  I know the information in this book has helped me truly embrace a more healthy lifestyle.  I used to struggle to not buy the potato chips and packaged cookies because I was on a \\"diet\\" - now it's easy to pass them over in the grocery store.  I am choosing (most of the time) to not be manipulated by the people that created them.  The cravings, the ridiculous amounts of additives and sugar, the misleading statements - just so the consumers would continue to buy these overpriced snacks and food items.  Now the whole dirty secret has been exposed.  I recommend this book to everyone.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|Still trying this out. Not sure what to expect but is already downloaded and installed so will have to work with it.
B00ALYY6ZA|1.0|Book says there are 30 days worth of recipes; there are only 10 days of 500 caloric intake and 10 of 600 caloric intake. Most of the book appears to me as an infomercial. However, I will follow some of the recipes and I will fast two days a week.

B0060MYM7O|5.0|The Blu-ray has a great picture and tons of special features. The story may stray a little from the books but it stays true to the overall story and may be even better.
B00004WEJZ|3.0|I am going to do this review in a different fashion then some of the previous ones.  First off I did not buy this off of Amazon, I was lucky enough to find this at record store just my luck because it is out of print, WTF MGM! (for those of you who are not aware MGM bought the rights to this film a couple years back, just so they own everything Bond related).  The great thing about this movie is of course the return of Sean Connery to the role of Bond, if it wasnt for him this movie would suck soooooo much.  The reason being is because this is a remake, meaning everything here has already been done previously in Thunderball, and yet because of Connerys return this is a must have for Bond super fans.  The movie starts off with a great opening action scene, but the problem with the intro is that you dont get that familiar gun barrel sequence that we all know love and the theme....well its kind of lame.  Once movie gets going its really not that bad, idk why fans hate it so much there have been cheesier EON Bond movies.  This movie has grit, like all of the earlier Connery Bond movies its just great to have to have that again.  Sean Connery just has this likability about him, he was the first cinema Bond and he paved the way for all the other actors.  If you are a die hard fan and you get a chance to pick this movie up, do it because you never know when or if you will ever come by it again.  After all as of this review, its out of print and pretty rare!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I choose the rating of this book five stars it grabs your attention.  After reading one page your hooked. I would recommend this book to anyone has seen the movie movie and who is a big fan of twilight series.

B00A757EFW|5.0|Lots of fun, i love this game, it entertains me during hours. It´s a classic, i love it, it´s great.
0142420891|5.0|This review was difficult to write. I didn't even know where to start. All I wanted to do was pick up the book and reread it. Because it was amazing, heartbreaking, and beautiful. I loved it even more than If I Stay.<br /><br />&#34;She kissed me good-bye. She told me that she loved me more than life itself. Then she stepped through security.<br />She never came back.&#34;<br /><br />I loved reading from Adam's point of view. The writing was so, so good. Some moments were really intense. And I felt like I could feel everything he was going through. His love, anger, loneliness, and anxiety. I just wanted to comfort him and tell him everything was going to be okay. Adam's emotions were so strong that, even though I love Mia, when he got angry and upset at her I couldn't help but to get angry and upset with her too. Like Adam, all I wanted to know was why she left and why she did this to him. When Mia finally told him, I was shocked. I was not expecting what she said, and it hurt so much. But it made complete sense, and I couldn't hold it against Mia.<br /><br />Like Mia's story, the majority of Adam's story is told in one day and includes flashbacks, which were really great. But Where She Went is a bit different. There are chapters this time. The book is longer. And there is some other things. But I don't want to reveal too much, and I won't say whether or not Adam and Mia have a happy ending. I will say though that I believe Gayle Forman gave us everything we wanted to know and more. Closure being one of those things.<br /><br />I hope I haven't overhyped the book. I don't want anyone to feel disappointed. (Although, I do think the hype is deserved, and I believe it lives up to it, but this is only how I felt.) If you loved If I Stay, I don't see how you won't love Where She Went. And if you didn't love the previous book, I think you should seriously give this sequel a chance. Where She Went made me appreciate If I Stay even more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game. I like it because it makes you think about what you are doing next. I think all the players out there who like this game will go GAGA over it. If you have skill this is the game for you.<br />  There are some mishions in this game too. It'll ask you to go on facebook and play with frends and things like that. You also have a store where you can buy things like a mystery box or power ups. You can also buy different subway suffers and boards.<br />  This is a wonderful app for everybody. Kids can play as well as adults. The levles are good when you beet then because you get more multiplayer.<br />  That's why you need skill for this game.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Author seems good at tricking the readers.<br />Liked the characters well enough.<br />Timely setting in today's political climate.<br />Good contemporary novel.
B008220D5K|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this movie. I don't understand why it has so many low ratings on here. We were laughing the entire movie. It's more realistic romantic comedy.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I can never seem to put the book down. Terry Goodkind is an amazing author his books just suck you in.

B007N5YIUS|5.0|This is nothing like the original angry birds.<br />You have to think hard and out of the box.<br />The gravitational influence of nearby planets has to be taken into account for instance.<br />Very challenging.
B006M9NJFG|5.0|I can't believe it it is the best canteen out side water can't get in the canteen and the material that it is made out of is the best I was hiking one day and dropped it 30 ft and saw that it had no scratches no dents no nothing it also has very good grip and the steel cup that comes with it is also nice cooks very well and I left it in the rain for a couple of days and it had no rusting on it so if I were you I would get ir

B0014WSX2K|3.0|This product is a 10 CD box of John Coltrane's 1950s recordings for Prestige, Riverside and Blue Note.  It is NOT the Blue Note reissue CD [[ASIN:B0000A5A0T Blue Train]], but the tracks released on the original Blue Note LP are included in this set. So all the other reviewers here are reviewing a different product. That is not very helpful, Amazon.  This Membran reissue is a cardboard box containing 10 CDs in cardboard sleeves. There is a track listing on the back of the box and on each sleeve, but there are no notes and no indication of the recording artists (other than John Coltrane), the date of recording, or the original label and LP release.  These are the original labels' most recent CD reissues of the contents:  Prestige:  CD 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8 from [[ASIN:B000000ZC3 The Prestige Recordings]]  Riverside:  &#34;Trinkle Trinkle&#34; and &#34;Nutty&#34; from [[ASIN:B000000Y2F Thelonious Monk With John Coltrane]], two of three tracks by the Monk/ColTrane quartet recorded at the Five Spot in 1957. The third track &#34;Ruby My Dear&#34; is omitted: in its place we have the studio recorded Monk/Coltrane duet &#34;Monk's Mood,&#34; most recently reissued in [[ASIN:B000FBHCQO The Complete 1957 Riverside Recordings (2 CD)]].  Blue Note:  &#34;Blue Train&#34; as originally issued on LP, without the alternate takes on the Blue Note reissue CD. [[ASIN:B000AV2GCE Thelonious Monk Quartet with John Coltrane at Carnegie Hall]].  Membran is a lower tier German reissue label. Higher tier reissue labels try to obtain the best possible sources: original mix and broadcast tapes, unplayed collector vinyl, etc. They provide booklets with detailed playlists and scholarly notes, and occasionally they even pay royalties to living artists. Membran simply copies the work of others and sells it cheaper. They appear to observe EU copyright laws. I  own a few of their classical reissue CDs and I have seen no signs of corrosion or other deterioration in 15 years.  I give this one star for the shlockola production and five stars for price: hence the three star rating. To me, these are Coltrane's most interesting recordings for Prestige without Miles Davis, his most interesting recordings with Thelonious Monk, and his first great album as leader. If you are on a tight budget, this reissue cannot be beat for price: but to get the most out of it, you will need a Coltrane discography or biography.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Has any word you can think of. I don't even know why I am doing a report on a DICTIONARY!!!!! Oh well,congrats and thank you Mr. Oxford.
B0058YPL66|5.0|This DVD not only has the first great season of Once Upon a Time, it also has several interesting bonus features.  It's interesting to hear the &#34;why&#34; behind the story.
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|The bottom line is below the edge of the screen.  In theory that shouldn't be possible since the app should adjust to the default screen size.  There is no way to get to the data.  I like all the other data provided by the app but since I can't see it all, this app is disappointing.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|I say &#34;a little&#34; only because when I purchased it, there is literally the tiniest of boxes where you can select standard vs. hd.  Strangely, I thought it simply would be HD from the  jump, and HD is the standard nowadays for nearly everything.<br /><br />Bear in mind I'm not confused about the terminology, just that the default option is standard def AND that the control for which option you'd like is so very tiny.<br /><br />Please Amazon, change this poor of UI.  Make HD the default setting, and for goodness sake make the selection UI more apparent.  UI is all we have when interacting with your company, and it should be better.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Not to be confused as a &#34;Space Invaders&#34; clone - which I probably would have been happy with. Considering I am a HUGE fan of Galaga, Galaxian, Phoenix, and every 80's &#34;invaders-inspired&#34; shooter - this one still managed to blow me away (pun). The graphics are perfect hybrid of 2D/3D look and feel. I believe the quasi-8-bit look was made to make some one like me nostalgic - and only adds to the experience! The game play and variety of challenges give it a HUGE replay factor. I thought I'd put it down after I played it once or twice. Nope. I want to see if I can get all them stars!<br />Lastly, I absolutely love it when you power-up into the &#34;Invincible&#34; mode the whole perspective goes &#34;3D&#34; (with the vantage point of being behind your ship). HA! Unbelievably clever and down-right fun.<br />Voxel Invaders is far and beyond your standard/classic shoot-'em-up - while retaining the classic feel so many of us love.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|A good game(amazing graphics!!). but you do the same thing over and over again. I think they should make it different everytime like subway suffers.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|A puzzle game with captivating music?! Wow - they really blended several gaming elements perfectly. Almost addicting without the frustration of other puzzle games. Navigating may seem tricky at first, but once you learn about &#34;slowing and speeding&#34; time - it's all in how much you want to control or risk as you drift and float around. You can also zoom-in, zoom-out with an unreal sense that you are looking at &#34;real organisms&#34;. Never thought I would enjoy it this much. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games, captivating music and stunning visuals. Endless ability to play over and over in Arcade mode!
B006L9B6TI|5.0|This is really a wonderful tool on getting you to count your blessings. I highly recommend it to anyone struggling with depression, &#34;bad luck,&#34; or simply having trouble feeling happy. It makes you realize that you cannot get anything more in life if you're not happy and grateful for what you have now.
0345803493|5.0|I have already read all 3 books on my Kindle and was just blown away.  Yes, \\"juicy\\" at times, and I have read books like these but I had to see for myself what all the hype was about.  In just a few days, I have read all 3 and I am so sad that they are over.  I had no idea how many books were in the trilogy and was looking for a 4th after finishing the 3rd.  I was seriously hooked and would escape on my Kindle any chance I got.  Stayed up way too late several nights in a row.  Just amazing!  Well written, great characters, awesome story lines.  Highly recommend!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|i bought it because it brings the main DVD, Blueray, and Blueray 3d, plus you get a digital download. loved it
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I got sucked into these books recently.  Given all the hype about these books, I just had to see for myself.  Can we say, addicted!  Well written, couldn't put my Kindle down and really enjoyed all 3.  Outstanding!!!!  Highly recommend!
B004UJ81IA|5.0|This is just a fun read.  I didn't know much about Robert Louis as a person but, I always liked him as an author.  This book was a surprise to me and of course the price was right.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have heard all of the hype about these books but just recently decided to see what all the hype was about.  So about 15 minutes ago, I finished this book, the last of them.  I honestly had no idea there were only 3 books to this trilogy and I am so sad now.  Fantastic books, all three.  I couldn't put my Kindle down to stop reading these.  I stayed up late every night reading more and more.  I carried my Kindle everywhere and every chance I got, I would read and read.  I couldn't get enough and can't believe it's over.  Well written and although very \\"juicy\\", I was seriously into these characters and their lives.  I felt like I could feel everything that Anastasia and Christian were feeling, the ups and downs.  As a 37 year old mother of 4 children and having been married for almost 17 years, I needed these books to spark something in me.  It's like a fantasy world and I went there by reading these books.  I just can't say enough.  I highly recommend reading the triology.  Just so awesome!!!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Colorful, fun and extremely addictive. A must have game for jewel game fans I could not believe that it was free. Also very age friendly, my eight year old loves it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I would recommend this book to most my friends. The story line that isn't about sex is great. I wish it didn't give such vivid details about the sex most the time but other than that I loved it.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Real problem with the transmission but the movie was good.  I would watch it again if the transmission was better.
B004AFFZNI|1.0|This does NOT work with the Hero3, even though it does come up as the right thing for the 3 here on Amazon. It looks like GoPro screwed up cause they list on their website the same model number as Amazon shows & the one I purchased. If the 3 requires a DIFFERENT Skel Case than the 2, shouldn't they have different product numbers?
B0098VXBIA|2.0|There were 2 parts that my wife and I enjoyed when she was about 20 weeks pregnant. But it wasn't that funny and mostly boring.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|It is fairly entertaining but the the liberties this film takes with history are just inexcusable. Hard to believe it won best picture.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is fun. And you can do lots of stuff on it I just wish you could ride the horses. If you like horses you will probably like this app!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is really horse loving. in a way it can teach kids about reasponsibility. the grafics are good! cool!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was very good, but the ending was too sudden. The twist of the love and the terror was a brilliant combination.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|wonderful series - so happy to have it home on DVD.  great writing, great characters, fabulous setting.  the DVD arrived on time.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|if YOU LIKED THE ALIEN MOVIES YOU GOTTA HAVE IT!!! IT'S WORTH THE PRICE.  MUCH CHEAPER THAN BUYING SEPERATE. GIVE IT A TRY!!!
B001QMCJ1Y|5.0|great, fabulous, heart warming story that is timeless and family friendly - a wonderful story for all ages.  the DVD arrived on time.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My 4 y.o niece Loves this game! Amazing graphics & animation! Easy to complete tasks with quick feedback for kids while giving a virtual experience of caring for a horse.

038532653X|5.0|When I began to read Skellig I didn't know what to expect. It turns out that this lack of knowledge was really the best way to enter the story so I won't say much about the plot here. I will say that Skellig is a truly remarkable book. It is strange and haunting. It is moving and powerful. It is sparse and simple, yet deceptively complex. The story is both fantastical, yet completely real.<br /><br />I read a lot of YA and middle-grades book and I know that David Almond intends for this to be in the YA category, but I will keep it on my personal shelf instead of taking it to my 5th grade classroom. For one thing, there's more cursing than I like to have in my classroom books. But my primary reasoning is that this book is just so powerful. At first glance it seems like a simple story about a strange man, but there is so much hiding between the lines and within the characters. In this way, Skellig reminds me of the Little Prince - a book written for children, but best understood and appreciated by adults.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|High quality app with 3d graphics that are fun to look at. Better by far then all other hungry shark apps. could be worth 1.99 but its free! play as several different species. all around entertaining, my favorite app in my collection.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love the app, creating different combinations n wake up feeling refreshed and better than just going to sleep without it. Have recommended it to others and some have used it and love it as well.
0307888681|5.0|Loved this story.  Great story development and depth.  Lots of detail looking at the Zombie apocalypse from various cultures.  Can't wait to be disappointed by the movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing-balls I love it I play on it every day!! The updates are really good and take you around the world xx
B0083Z614S|5.0|i love this story  always have always will why do you want more words when i don't have more to say
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|A slow relaxing game except during challenge mode when you have two minutes to complete the puzzles in and it progresses from super boring easy in glass to a little more difficult in the stone which is as far as I've made. I like this puzzle game and would recommend for those who enjoy puzzles.
B00AYJCEYC|5.0|I gave this CD to my Mum as a Mothers Day gift as my Mum loves Michael's music. My Mum loves the CD and is delighted Michael has taken on such an iconic group of songs.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an amazing game for horse lovers. Get this game as soon as u can. U can take care of ur horse while training them to compete in jumping competitions. Take them through and over many obstacles. Make sure to keep ur horse happy and healthy. Get this game now!!!!
B00BF11STU|5.0|This is one of the great movies of all time for some of the same reasons that LINCOLN received so much acclaim.  Nevertheless, dirty deal-making and bribery that were employed to pass the 13th Amendment in a severely divided House in 1865 must seem relatively tame compared to the depiction of nauseating and disgraceful acts of torture and humiliation inflicted on prisoners in efforts to extact information concerning the location of Bin Laden.  This movie is unappologetic in its quest for realism and detail.  However disturbing it is -- and it really is disturbing in many ways -- the search for Bin Laden and for some measure of justice or closure following the dreadful crimes of 911 is as much a part of the history of our own time as was the final, legal destruction of Slavery in 1865 for those who suffered through the Civil War.<br /><br />The acting was first rate as was the depiction of the assault on Bin Laden's compound.  While Maya and the leading specialists in the operation were given prime focus in this movie, it is also clear that the effort required the skill and intensely hard work by many individuals as well as a good measure of luck. One can empathize with the frantic and seemingly unhinged Maya as she scrawls numbers on the office wall of her CIA boss  ---  29, 51, 100, 129 etc. --- depicting the number of days after she unveiled the location of what she is utterly convinced is the hiding place of Osama Bin Laden before action was finally taken.<br /><br />You will want to buy the dvd and re-watch certain sequences as the complex and difficult process may not be easy to absorb in one viewing.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I have nothing but good to say about Nichilas Sparks.  I have loved each book U have read.  I am only comparing this book to the ones I consider to be five star ratings. I normally love eaach of his books
B000FCKBCU|5.0|She's dead on with what being an attorney is like (big firm life anyway). It was like reading about my own life, and I am now also transitioning to something else so it was really perfect. Easy fast read! A++
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is kind of temple run but your timed and there's many obstacles. But it's really fun so if your looking for a racing challenge, this will be the the game for you!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I am in my 30s and cannot WAIT for the next Riordan book. When i first began reading them I looked into how accurate his depictions of the different Gods are and he REALLY does a Wonderful job. FAST read, energetic, creative... LOVE THESE. ALL SERIES.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I love this game even though I suck at it!!! It's great for when your bored or  Just at home sitting around!!!!!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This app works great on my Kindle Fire. There is an add but it's at the bottom of the screen out of the way. If all you need is a basic calculator than this will the job done.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game! The game has renewable energy and new quests to keep you intrigued. I could play for hours!
0307916812|5.0|My daughter is a lover of this series. She has read them multiple times and loves listening to them as well. Product quialty is excellent.
B005FISBTO|3.0|We were very happy to get season six then the dvd failed so I returned it and received replacement which had the same problem. We were able to play it in another dvd player so we all ended up in one bedroom watching it. I suspect that it was a poor quality dvd. I ordered season 7 and hope it plays well
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book. I like how it ties in all the love between Peeta<br />and Katiness.  And how she saves there lives, by fighting for her love for Peeta and that she is poor in the beginning and then in the end is becoming rich and slips away from Peeta. Have to read it...you will love it
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This movie was written and produced very much like a book. I enjoyed this aspect which kept me engrossed in the story. It's a story of right and wrong, good and bad and all the emotions of life. A movie you have to &#34;feel&#34; to really enjoy it. You may have to watch a second time (and well worth it) to get truly involved. I also really liked the 3D cinematography giving this film its stunning effects and showing nature in its beauty as well as fury. Also, the ending has a &#34;food for thought&#34; twist. You'll have to see the movie to make your own conclusions.<br /><br /> Overall, a very good movie with a compelling story and excellent visual effects.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Absolutely not what I expected, but very good. Well written and absorbing,  with very flawed characters who become strangely endearing.
B00AZM7IQC|4.0|I really liked this show for its excellent production value in exhibiting the Cirque Du Soleil shows in stunning 3D. I was very happy to see some of the acts closeup in this filming. I have seen a few live shows (O, Ka, Mystere & Michael Jackson) and really enjoy this type of entertainment. I always sit within the first 5 rows and have not been disappointed. 5 Stars for the live shows!<br /><br />I really didn't like the plot (if you can call it that), about a girl searching for an aerialist, basically giving the film a venue to pass from scene to scene of the various shows which include the ones I mentioned except for Michael Jackson. If you like this type of acrobatic entertainment, you will enjoy this movie. I am pleased to have it on 3D to show my guests something out of the ordinary.<br /><br />Again, a very good presentation of the Spectacular Cirque Du Soleil Shows.
B00AYCOUOG|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from any new material by Suede.  After seeing them in 2010 in London I was impressed by the fire and passion the band had in them playing live. That passion is abundant on Bloodsport.  I have listened to the CD multiple times and it justs keeps getting better.  The songs, lyrics and hooks are amazing. The single \\"It Starts and Ends With You\\" is nonstop perfect British pop with as much amazing hooks you can cram into a song and still have it flow perfectly. I loved Suede in the 90's and this album has made me love them again.  My only hope is they tour the US.  If you ever liked Suede you are going to love Bloodsport and if this is your first encounter with the band you will end up buying thier early back catalog.  Once again brilliant return.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This is quite possibly the best book I've ever read. Lengthy, yes, but it took me all of 4 days to read this massive 600 pager. There is never a break in the action. A bit graphic, though, I must say. Elizabeth Haynes has no problem putting in ever detail of their sex!
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|when I bought it and donloded it it said I didn't own the app but I bought it please help
B00AREIAI8|4.0|great game. especially for horse lover's. graphics are done very well. almost life like. definately one of my personal favorites
030758836X|5.0|I'm not a big book reader but just finished this one and really enjoyed! Hard to put down at times. Great story telling and characters...hear they are making a movie based on book...can't wait! Want to read author's other books now.
B003O86FMW|5.0|started a little dull, but eventually turned into an adventure would recommend it for anyone wanting a little adventure take a peek
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|this game is just like Mario and I'm the type of person who loves Mario so by saying that I'm also saying I live this game
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am still learning all the features, but I love being able to have my bible with me anywhere and being able to have so many versions as a reference.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I have read all the Beautiful Creature series and I loved the whole thing.  It was interesting to see how the characters changed and grew during their years together.  I started reading the series because of the movie preview and I couldn't quit until I had read all of it.  i enjoyed it very much and will be looking for other books from this author.
B000YPWBQ2|5.0|Spiegel im Spiegel (mirror in mirror) is performed 3 times on this SACD, on different instruments: first on violin and piano, then viola and piano, and finally, cello and piano. Inbetween, there are 3 other works:<br /><br />* Variationen zur Gesundung von Arinuschka - for solo piano<br />* Für Alina - for solo piano (Alina is Pärt's daughter)<br />* Mozart Adagio - for violin, cello and piano<br /><br />The works are restful, simple and minimalist ... perhaps even moreso than usual for Pärt. The performances are neat, clean and polished -- just right ... They are easy pieces to play, but not everything that is easy, is easy to play well. And the sonics are super (I listen in stereo) and seem to match the ethereal character of the works.<br /><br />Definitely worth buying (even though the playtime is perhaps a little short at 46 minutes). Beautiful SACD.<br /><br />I believe it is out of print, so I would not procrastinate either.<br /><br />Performance:4.5<br />Sonics: 5<br />Recording resolution: unstated<br />Superjewel box: Yes
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|Runs perfectly on my kindle fire hd...<br />Beautiful graphics, a nice change from the usual blood and darkness.  Lots of hog, and puzzles.  Not too hard or too easy, I rarely need the hint button but I still have to think.<br />Nice music, very relaxing.  I highly recommend it.
B003UGLCIA|1.0|The 1 star is only because I am chicken.<br /><br />I saw this around age 10ish or so.  It scared the crap out of me then and still does.  I have tried for 20+ years to re-watch this movie; during the day with friends, with Bibles all over (even clutched in hand)...etc.  So I buy it; what was I thinking?  It is and always will be the SCARIEST movie ever.<br /><br />About the seller, all good.  I received fast arrival and it arrived in excellent condition!  Just haven't gathered enough Bibles or people to come and watch it with me yet.  :(<br /><br />This is this a well written, directed and acted REALLY SCARY MOVIE!.
B004PHE9F6|5.0|I really like that movie, real races scenes and as said in the extras, very difficult to happen again. I recommend it.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Fun time waster, great levels of difficulty and tons of fun power ups. I was not excepting the shift to 3D.
B003L77GG0|4.0|Kina loses my attention at times and seems rushed but i had to get it caus its smallville.If you into smallville get it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love love love this game!!!!! my friend and i play it all that time i just got it today and im already addicted!!!!
B00A85EMVK|3.0|Top Gun is a great movie and perhaps the fact I've seen it many times impacts my rating a little.  If it were a new movie on 3D I may have rated it a little higher.  The 3D in the movie is just ok...
B0093OGBL6|5.0|As the artist of many Michael Jackson portraits, I got a copy of Dr. Moriarty's book about MJ last fall. Since then, we have become professional colleagues in our shared admiration of MJ and in our desire to advance his legacy.  I do this with my artwork and she with her book. She has written a very caring book about MJ. As a long-time admirer of Michael, I hope that my portraits of him can help to inspire others to enjoy his music, to appreciate his artistry, & to continue his humanitarian activities. I also hope that Dr. Moriarty's book will inspire people in the same ways.  Alex Krasky, Las Vegas Artist
B003L77GG0|5.0|this is a good item gave it 5 starts , it works well i would buy this again as needed
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|This microphone works just fine and is a real bargain for the price, in my opinion. I highly recommend it.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|It was like War and Peace, but written by Boris Karloff and Vincent Price, different and Well conceived and written.
B00005JM1F|5.0|I love using the amazon fulfillment my movies always come in 2 days,movie came wrapped & with a note attached because it was a gift I like how it came I'm going to order one for myself if you love your movies quick& fast major sure at the bottom it says fulfillment by amazon you are sure to get your movies quick and without the extra shipping fees
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Being bias toward the Harry Potter series what else could I say.  I can't wait to get a bigger tv.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This calculator is well designed! It functions well, and it looks great. I like that it retains your last calculation. Love it!
B003L20IJM|5.0|A welcome relief from sex and violence and a really intertaining movie for all ages.  Will enjoy it for years.
B00B99KJR0|2.0|It's almost like other similar games, except it tries to push other free trial games EVERY TIME you play.  Totally sucks for a purchased app.
B002LC8HF0|4.0|A bit longer then it needed to be but the ending is worth it.  A very different take on the &#34;dark lord&#34; story.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Good series. The last one was missing a little action at the end. I wish there was a longer conclusion.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|purchasing the complete second season of game of thrones on blu-ray has turned out as a great success. the product was safely packed - it didn't have any damages but a few small imprints. the blu-rays work fine and the extra dvds are great too.<br />putting it in a nutshell it is a must have for all got-fans. :)
B005S9EJ14|4.0|Since a friend of mine enjoys good movies, I decided to give this film as a gift. I'm sure it will be enjoyed to the fullest because of the reviews. The friend was happy to receive it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cable is much more sturdy and longer than the original, it helps when I have to plug it farther away. Also seems to be a tighter fit and doesn't fall out.
B002ZG97M4|3.0|Frankly, I would have given this a one, but as I mention in other reviews I watch movies with my son and he said it was a &#34;5&#34; so I split the difference. His opinion is it is fast paced, entertaining with excellent dancing and well worth watching again (we had seen it at the theater). And he put it on his wish list so I bought it. My opinion is it is a pale poor imitation of the original
B006LSZECO|3.0|I loved 90% of it, but I HATED the ending. It was just unfortunate to get that invested in a book and have it end so poorly.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I went with my son to see the movie, and we both liked it so much we actually saw it 3 times. It is very rare that we agree on something this much. The plot is solid and the music is amazing, and obviously even after seeing it 3 times my son put this on his wish-list and I got it for him as a gift.
B001BANK32|5.0|Having watched the movies (and &#34;knowing&#34; the story) I thought this book wouldn't scare me. I was wrong.<br /><br />Now, I am very much looking forward to finding out what happens to Danny in 'Dr. Sleep.'
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I used this on the original Kindle fire and now on the updated Kindle Fire, it works great, graphics are solid and I haven't had any of the issues or bugs other reviewers have mentioned. I do find it a bit harder than the other ones, but that is not a negative in my eyes. I enjoy a good challenge!
B00AFOS6P2|4.0|Even though  \\"Push The Sky Away\\" lacks the intense emotional `punch' of \\"The Boatman's Call\\" or \\"No More Shall We Part\\", it's still the best album Cave has released in years.  The songs, many of them, are quite beautiful in an ethereal fashion and the lyrics are as dark and literate as you'd expect from a man whose vocals are marked by the intelligence and authenticity that only masters like Dylan, Cohen or Tom Waits can deliver.  Cave obviously wanted a unity of atmosphere in these songs, perhaps a desire for the listener to regard the album as one piece of work and not a collection of casually related songs. But I suspect a little variety might have raised the emotional ante here, and the inclusion--in my opinion at least--of a few songs like \\"Abattoir Blues\\" or \\"Messiah Ward\\" would have been welcome, possibly giving a greater depth and resonance to the final work.  That work is solid, haunting, understated (perhaps too understated at times), and quite beautiful; it's a nice change indeed from the raucous din of the Grinderman recordings.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Well worth the .99, would definitely recommend for Kindle HD.  Tells how much time you have to do various things.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|More of a mystery, of finding who Gray really is and to why he is the way he than of sexual arousal
B00A0SQBDM|3.0|I purchased this game as a full game only to getpart way through it and it said I couldn't go any further unless I wanted to unlock full version! I paid for full version! I was ripped off,even though it was a good game.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This was a great bargain! I love this movie and the message it gives. I purchased this for my son but really wanted it for myself!
B002NZK5TG|5.0|Purchased for someone else. Process very easy, will be using this site in the future for my own purchases ...
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Fascinating reading.  Learned a lot.  The book may scare some people.and they might starting they thinking that they have the disease, but most people can go the their doctor and have the enzyme test.
0880796863|5.0|I really enjoyed the book to these cards.  It gives great explanations without being too over the top on any specific path.  I am really not any kind of specificly religious person, and I could relate into the book.  The cards themselves are beautiful and easy to handle.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a fun experience with different horses and hope to train them and feed them I would recommend this little kids
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton is one of my favorite authors - I love the way she writes.  The Secret Keeper is just as good as The Forgotten Garden and her other books.  It is an enjoyable read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is subway surfer.I love this game because it is so fun for kids that are young and old.It encourages you to keep playing.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|When you think nothing new can be written about slavery - here comes Kathleen Grissom with The Kitchen House.  I am so glad that I didn't live during this horrible time in history but glad that a gifted writer can remind us of the freedoms we enjoy today.  It is so easy to portray all whites as mean and all slaves as good - something Grissom does not do and that is why this book is worthy of mention.
014241493X|1.0|I'll admit, I'm sure being a 30+ Mom of three doesn't make me the target audience for this book but after reading another of his books, I picked up this one.  The story itself is okay. I liked it overall (a fast not thinking too much about it read). I was very disappointed and turned off to the point of almost putting the book down. I was really upset that the author who is obviously a man with a wide vocabulary felt the need to use the word \\"retarded\\" multiple times in a derogatory way. Had I not been fairly well into the book I would have stopped.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|I have seen this movie numerous times over the past fifty years and it still scares me. Psycho and Rear Window are the best movie Hitchcock ever made. The sequels and remakes could never capture the magic of the original. If you cannot capture the magic of the first movie,, which is impossible, then why even try.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I downloaded a few different calculators before finding this one.  I have been using this regularly and have not been disappointed.
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|It took my kids a few minutes to get in to this movie, but then they were hooked. The black and white is a nice touch. The style appealed to me as an adult.
0385360169|3.0|Evidently the author has a strong desire for sexual relations. The first three CD's seemed to tell of a love story that would bridge the gap of a successful guy with extreme wealth and a naïve college girl. From disc 4 and to the end it was sex in detail. By the time it got to disc 16, it was boring. It should have an -X- rating on the label.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My kids (ages 7-9) love this film. They saw it in the theatre and were thrilled when I could get it on Amazon streaming. The jokes are perfect for their sense of humor. Note: it's one of those movies that your kids will repeat lines from for a long time after!
0385344228|5.0|How inconsiderate of you. Don't you get it? People want to be surprised, not told about the result of a mystery/court room thriller, especially in one elementary sentence. Thanks for ruining it.<br /><br />UPDATE: The story was well-written and absorbing. Hence, the now 5 star rating.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|not as awesome as sonic but awesome and you get to kill zombies I mean what can be more awesome than that!!!! &lt;3 I'm a girl and I love violent games and sonic and my little pony espiacally sonic and my little pony couples go sondash.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Excellent app ideal for letting you know what battery is remaining and how lo it will take to recharge & by what. Sell worth the free download.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|easy way to pass the time - I love playing this for a quick game or sometimes ill play for nearly an hour or more at once. its like playing in an arcade but better
B00171EO0I|1.0|Must have been poorly made as if failed to keep running before movie was over.  We had to buy it from online in order to see the end.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Very entertaining. Makes me want to live to be 100. Seems like a long time. I hope I can stay as healthy as Allen.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so fun you can make you own world and play multiplayer with all kinds of materials and supplies.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love jetpack joyride beacause my cousin got it on his game and I think its really cool you should get it.
B006G3MZRQ|3.0|This movie has it all. Predictability, cliches galore, bad acting and an obviously too old Nick Nolte. The best thing about this movie is that I didn't spend any money on it.
0060919760|3.0|Sorry, this was a gift for a friend and I didn't read it so I can't judge it.  However, I know he is a good writer on his level.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this is a great app for everyone. my dad is turning 40 something this year and this all he plays. its also great for the fires.
B00BF11STU|1.0|I got more out of live news reports.  Intel is straight forward, Nd there hasn't been a decent film about the &#34;inner workings&#34; since Syriana.  So it boils down to making a choice, as a historical recreation for posterity, well, best get the opinons of those who actually saw it unfold.  As entertainment, it might have been more interesting to see him go to trial if he hadn't died.  Or, one might ask, is he really dead, and not in some black ops prison, as some claimed the Russians took Hitler.  The script was flat that enough that I fell asleep for most of it.  I should have just done a rental; now I own it, sheesh! I'd love to see a movie about Adam Gadan gettin it---rotten trader
1452101248|5.0|This is one of my favorite cookbooks ever!<br />It's packed full of all sorts of recipes and the photography is also excellent. Everything really does taste as good as it looks! I have yet to make one and not like it. Brilliant, easy to follow combinations of ingredients and instructions. You will not be disappointed!
B00127RAJY|5.0|While she is very demanding she is also a great instructor. Personally, I like her instruction style; always wanting you to give more and do your best. It did kick my butt because this was the kick start to a new workout plan but it is also what I needed to get started! I think it is good for workout beginners.
B004JRVQX0|5.0|This iLok serves well to hold my licenses and authorizations for my recording software. Never had a problem and feel it was money well spent.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I am a business major and got this video to fill me in on what happened during the housing bubble. It was very interesting and informative! Plus it got me more interested in my classes and allowed me to actually participate during class discussions.
0545265355|4.0|I've wanted this boxed set for awhile. I was happy to find it at this price. It's a gift for a family member who's a &#34;Games&#34; nut so it'll work just fine.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|This movie is funny most of the time, the rest is vulgar and obnoxious. Silly entertainment. There are some very funny situations, but Ted did get to be too much for me.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Great quality and easy to use very happy with this product. I would recommend this item for other Kindle users.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|this classic thriller filmed in Monaco has suspense, beauty and wit.<br />I loved the gorgeous dresses of Grace Kelly. A must see, good family entertainment.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Takes a bit of time to get coins, but if you're patient this game can be very fun. I really enjoy it..:)
B00APUYWYA|5.0|A fun, entertaining, young audience movie. The singing is what actually makes this movie successful.<br />Good and light family entertainment
B00A85EMVK|4.0|Very nice collection. I would have given 5 Stars but the picture of 3D version is very corny. Some like it , I don't - for 3 D I would prefer a completely clean smooth picture.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|well I think it should have less bumps and go little slower and more time or no time at all!!!;)
B001608QVS|5.0|Very nicely made collection with absolutely superb picture, sound & extras, including some nice memorabilia. I would reccomend this to every film buff, also to watch it on a big screen through a good HD beamer.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|If you like superhero movies, or action movies, or comedy movie, then you will like this movie. It has everything a movie needs.
1616550414|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my son.  He loves it.  The book has a LOT of great, useful info on Zelda.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Lena claimed both sides light and dark which is what people have been mostly.  The love between Lena and Ethan works for the moving forward of Casters mortals omnibus alike.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Game of Thrones will catch your attention and not let it go. Can't wait for season 3 to start next week. Had to order HBO just so that I could watch it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a wonderful series! It's going to live with me for quite a while. Rarely am I so moved by a book.
B007URCTOG|4.0|This was a good romantic movie.  The movie seemed a bit flat at times but it wasn't a fatal flaw.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is perfect for people who want a fun game that you can play while relaxing.  I recommend this game for all horse lover's. Great graphics and gameplay, plus a variety of custom aspects such as the saddle, horse (Like my favorite the rainbow unicorn), And of course the costumes.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It was just as good as the first one. I can't wait to read the next. Was up at night reading and avoiding sleep.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book makes me understand the real live of US Navy SEALs more. It also takes me through another side of the service men, not the killing engines as we used to know before.
B009KEN87O|4.0|Old dog with some new tricks. Great retro game done right. Not a straight rip off but a worthy homage to top down shooters of the past.
B0041CGP02|5.0|I don't know why it took me so long to get a Bon Jovi cd!  So very glad I did!
B004SOR4H6|1.0|This app never works for me. On any of my devices. I must be either tech dumb or too savvy. I dont get it.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I love all the english women in this movie. Joan, Judy and Maggie are English stars of stage and theater.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|Had to have it to open latest version PDFs no worries. I can take it or leave it. Provides little more ability to see pdf docs, so thtas cool I suppose.
B007JGAR6U|5.0|A perfectly sized small flash, fairly powerful, manual and auto control, works excellently off-camera, and perfectly matches with the X-Pro1 and is fine on the smaller X-E1. Doesn't bounce so that could be an issue for some. I love this thing!
B0085W09ME|1.0|Definitely not what I was hoping ti would be. Appears it is a European app.I get quotes and such in USd, but then if I want to see details or purshace, it changes everything to EUR. UGH!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't put it down - such an intriguing and uplifting story.  It has a dark side that makes it interesting & the sexy parts made me blush and I loved it!
0156030306|5.0|I am a grown man, and I cried for the last 30 mins of reading the book. I won't spoil anything, although this is a classic and I'm sure many people intersted in reading it know the bulk of the story. I knew what was going to happen and I still enjoyed it immensely. This is one of my favourite books I've ever read, and has added to how I view people around me. Heartbreaking and beautiful.
B00BCOGM78|5.0|LET THE RHYTHM HIT 'EM.<br /><br />15 more words required for me to post this review online so I am done.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is very fun and enjoyable! I use it in my down time, and it helps me relax. 5 stars!
B000TO0T4O|5.0|Really good book. I have read Alex Rider a lot. Never thought he would do what I just read. I wonder what happens next!!!!!
B003PIUBZS|5.0|And even though it's true, and I'm not gay, btw, I still love this show! Sure, I wish they didn't turn it into a gay porn show, and I would never have believed it if someone had told me before seeing this that I would love a gay porn show, but it's a fantastic show! It's a fantastic series. I happen to love almost anything that has to do with the Roman Empire, because that's one of my favorite historical periods. I loved the HBO series, Rome, and all those Roman Empire movies from the 50s and 60s. It's a shame Andy Whitfield died of cancer, but that new guy is doing a great job, and the show hasn't missed a beat. Bottom line, Spartacus, in all three seasons, and the prequel, too, is over the top violence, over-the-top sex, over the top everything, but one hell of a great show!
B000RD0RDU|2.0|Fortunately this was cheap enough that it I can just chalk it up to being something that you might want to have in your hand so you can really see if it is the item/connection/whatever that you’re looking for.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great game. Definitely fun to play when you are bored. There is this really cool feature that when you get this item it makes the game go from 2D to 3D.Very creative and fun. Good job!
0545265355|5.0|As a busy academic type, my life has been filled with piles of journal articles and textbooks for many years, leaving little space for the pleasures of fiction.  I have tried to remedy this sad situation, but with little success.  The Hunger Games Trilogy has cured me!  Up till 2:00, sometimes 4:00, couldn't put it down...I found myself bubbling over with enthusiasm of all kinds:  for the story, the characters, the writing.  What a gem.  A classic, for sure.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Unlike a number of reviewers, I found Zachry's section the most creative & fun to read. The author is a master of dialect-writing and even creates his own in a very believable way. It takes patience to read & appreciate this book, and some parts are tedious (especially the Thriller section, which goes on & on & on). While I wouldn't call it 'brilliant' or 'masterful' as some do, it's definitely worth the time & will stick with you when lesser works have been forgotten. The book is interesting structurally, but as for plot- It's 6 different tales with very weak links to join them, but I did like it and found it worth reading.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is good for all ages. I love it. Somehow the game was reset so I had to start all over.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|well thought out. glad I found it. Its a little slow though but that could be because of the electronic I'm  using.
1616550414|5.0|This book is wonderful!<br /><br />It ties the full Legend of Zelda mythos together, to what extent it can be.  Plenty of art, interesting notes from the creators.  I would highly recommend this to any Zelda fan.
B00A2H9L2E|5.0|This is a great sequel from the first Silent Hill. A newcomer to series wont be lost even if they missed the first movie. I recommend watching the first movie and then this one.
0446619078|4.0|The Last Cayote is Michael Connelly's fourth Bosch novel. The first third of the story is slow and boring as are most beginnings in Connelly's novels. But, wow, does it pick up in midstream and finishes with more twists, turns and excitment than on a Grand Prix race track.<br />In this novel we learn more about Bosch's youth, much of it spent in various foster homes. He, along with the reader, finds out more about his mother, the role she played in his early life, and how and why her life came to an abrupt end. There's also just enough romance and sarcastic humor thrown in to make it interesting.<br />This is by far the best Bosch novel Connelly has written. He keeps the reader on edge and tense throughout. The suspense is genuine and spills onto every page. Michael Connelly is surely the master of intrigue. The reader is constantly shocked by the unexpected. Believe me, this book will keep you up nights.
B001NU4CM8|5.0|My husband has been looking for this album forever, and I was surprised to find the download on Amazon.com.  He was so excited and delighted to be able to listen to one of his favorite albums from the 1970s.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent book. I do wish I had read the book prior to watching the movie. The movie images polluted my visualizations. That said, the movie was pretty true to the book as the author worked with the producers. Looking forward to reading the next two books :)
B000244FDW|4.0|I've taken some time to read many of the reviews here.  I think it helpful to know something of the qualifications/limitations of a reviewer.  I'm a middle age, married man.  I like to read.  I like many types of books and movies.  I've been enjoying reading Jane Austen's novels these past few months, then researching the internet for favorite film versions of the stories.  I've only Northanger Abbey to finish now and I'll have read all six novels.  I've also purchased several dvd adaptations.  I'm not a scholar of Austen, and I certainly don't have profound insight.  But I think I read with fairly efficient comprehension. Reading her prose and syntax is very entertaining, but I believe it would be easy for careless readers to miss the subtlety if they don't pay attention.  I was constantly pulling out a dictionary, or re-reading entire sections.  And since I'm not from the England of 1800, the visualization of film makers is helpful to me to more clearly imagine the settings of the novels.<br /><br />Like many who have posted an opinion here, I enjoyed reading Pride and Prejudice.  I actually read it twice in a row a few months ago.  I'd seen the Greer Garson film adaptation a few times on Turner Classic Movies, and I very much enjoyed the BBC Jennifer Ehle version when I recently watched it after reading the book.  I purchased the BlueRay dvd.  I recommend it.  I agree that it is easy and fun to watch it repeatedly.  I've also seen the much later film starring Kiera Knightly, and I like it also.<br /><br />The older BBC Elizabeth Garvie version is available on Netflix, and I also found a dvd copy locally at a bookstore.  The picture and sound quality suffers in comparison to products of today's technology.  But the product isn't very expensive, and the viewing experience is pleasurable.  Many of these reviews for this serial version compare it to the later produced Jennifer Ehle serial.  For me, there's an unfairness about that since the principals involved with the Garvie version didn't have the advantage of seeing the later product.  So I watch this older series with a respect for its originality.  I like the adaptation very much, I like Ms. Garvie as Elizabeth Bennet and she matches closely what my mind's eye pictured her.  (I still remember when I was a younger man.  Ms. Garvie was a lovely young woman.)  I like the stage play quality which I take as intended.  That does give it a less \\"film perfect\\" aspect, but it doesn't bother me since I read the book more as a play than a reality.  There are many scenes in the book that would have been lit only by candle light.  This adaptation attempts to reproduce that effect, there are shadows across the faces sometimes.  Any criticism of lighting or production values is lost on me.<br /><br />My opinion is that the only relevant comparisons should be made to the original source material....the book.  Some characters/actors in this film are closer to what my reader's imagination envisioned than their counterparts in the later films.  Other characters are better represented in the later films.  As the saying goes, \\"there's no accounting for taste in art\\".  The five sisters in this version are attractive and look enough alike to believe they're related.  I like the portrayal of Mary particularly.  She isn't unattractive and she's more complex than assumed.  While pretending to be anti-social, she actually very much wants to participate and succeed socially.  I still haven't seen a Mr. Collins that reflects what I read.  In the book he is very young, like his cousins.  His youth is what gives his behavior as a suck-up to Lady de Bourgh much of the humor of his character.  He tries very hard to act older, and more important than he is, which Mr. Bennet especially enjoys.  The film actor for Mr. Collins seemed too old for my idea.  The actor who plays Kitty is attractive, but seems a little too old as well.  Jane Bennet was attractive, as required in the book plot.  I could agree withMr. Darcy that she was the handsome woman at the assembly.  Mr. Bennet was correctly portrayed as something of a disappointment as a father to his daughters, and his marriage an example of the type of disappointment that Elizabeth and Jane wanted to avoid in their own lives.  Mrs. Bennet was written by Austen with a great deal of irony.  If you know that, you can find it in this film as well.<br /><br />There's a momentary scene where Miss Anne de Bourgh attempts to reach/connect with Elizabeth when they say their good-byes.  It's telling that she's a captive to her domineering mother, and would love to express herself as freely as Elizabeth is able.  I'm anxious to re-read the book to look for that theme.  If it isn't in the book, I still thought it added something of value to the play.  Like many of the others who have recorded their opinions here, I could go on with more.<br /><br />For me, two very important moments in the book are, one, when Elizabeth reads Darcy's letter and realizes how wrong she had been in her judgements of Darcy and Wickham.  How \\"...I, who have valued myself on my abilities...Till this moment I never knew myself\\".  This is included in the screen play.<br /><br />The second event I looked for, and I think my most noticeable impression was the lack of this scene, is where Elizabeth confesses that her feelings for Darcy began to change when she finally saw Pemberley.  The book scene is between Jane and Elizabeth after both their engagements are established and Jane is catching up on events unknown to her.  Superficially it seems unbecoming of Elizabeth to attach value to the wealth of Darcy's estate, etc.  But I read it as a watershed moment when Elizabeth began to understand the significance of what Mr. Darcy was offering her.  It wasn't just romance on the table.  Not only was she becoming aware that Darcy was an admirable man, but also he was offering her an inclusion in a generational continuity of benevolence that he'd inherited; and that he had to, and wanted to, respect.  This would be something she could justifiably be \\"proud\\" of.  I thought these were important elements in the book and I think Jane Austen thought so also.  Although there is a film scene where Elizabeth reflects on the many responsibilities that Darcy shoulders as the principal resident of his community, this last impact on Elizabeth (or at least the dialog from the book I was expecting) wasn't included in the film.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know?  It's strangely fun to read the book and get lost in it...even for an old man.  I need to re-read the book now that I've seen these several films.  I think there's a tendency to half remember dialog from the book, hear it again in a film, and then say the film was faithful to the book when it really wasn't the case.<br /><br />At any rate, I wanted to add my approval of this film to the data base here.  I understand a little of the passion of readers of Jane Austen, and their possessiveness of the story of Pride and Prejudice.  I assume that many fans are relatively young people.  I think many over-react to the film versions, but I admire their affection for the source material.  I don't have many problems with books adapted to film.  I finish by repeating my opinion that the comprehension that readers possess as a habit or skill (or their lack of it) is evident in reading some of their criticism archived here.  And comparing the BBC Jennifer Ehle adaptation (which is great but isn't always faithful the the book) to this older stage play film doesn't seem sensible to me.

B00A17AD36|4.0|This artist brings out the wild things in women when I play it for them. The beats and lyrics mix and match so well together, its hard to not want to be in the mood to make love. I wholeheartedly recommend this item. The only issue is there are not enough great tracks, but the few I know you will choose, are spectacular!!

B009L7MD44|2.0|First of all this product claims to do exactly what every iOS device holder wishes you could do. In reality it does some things but, not everything you would hope it to do. The product I received had version 2 firmware, the developer provides instruction on the website on how to upgrade the firmware. Problem is that the information provided in the pathetic book provided with the product directs you to a website that is no longer valid. The information on the website of hyperdrive.com has the information but it requires lots of digging. The instructions for upgrading the firmware are inaccurate, the &#34;DropBox&#34; support is not included, you have to download &#34;Apps&#34; from their website and install them. The instructions for these are also misleading. I have yet to get a successful connection to infrastructure mode on Wi-Fi and share data or set up DropBox (partially because the apps are in Chinese not English).<br /><br />Furthermore, I really hoped to move my iTunes videos to an external hard drive and be able to play them directly. Guess again you can not do this. All videos have to be played through their software or web interface, same with accessing other files. I still have not figured out how to save files from the iPad to the hard drive either.<br /><br />I have over 20 years in the tech industry and a degree in computer sciences, this product is a great concept, but poorly executed. I hope that future revisions to firmware make it operate better.

B0006AAS5G|3.0|Large second hand should be fixed, makes tacky on bezel decorative only. Also, I wish Amazon and others would follow more standard practice of advertising watch size without crown, this is a 40 mm watch, not 43mm. I have a big wrist and find 40mm wears a little small so returned it. That's just me and others may be fine with size.<br />It is a nice looking piece, and if you are looking for a Daytona homage for under a hundred bucks, it's worth a look.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|It is a funny book and a great way to continue the sequel... hopefully there will be many more to come
B00B9E29CI|5.0|I really liked this book because it tries to highlight the areas which can help children excel at school and beyond and how non cognitive skills are important apart from IQ. It was a very enjoyable book to read. It gives a good stand point to a lay man as to what ails the education system and what can be done to improve how education is imparted in low income children's schools who stand deprived from good quality education.

0765334798|1.0|I just finished reading Redshirts. The joke about Star Trek redshirts has been done, and while I do appreciate his humour the author fails to shed any new observations on a tired trope.  Scalzi is a hack.  His world-building skills are non-existant and he perpetually relies on his readers to fill in the blanks while leaning on other, more creative authors, efforts.  I honestly cannot figure out how Scalzi has recieved the acclaim he has.  He even admits in the first coda that breaking the fourth wall has been done before (and better) and later acknowledges he's a lazy writer.  I agree.  ....alot.

B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is much better than the Solitare that came with my Tablet.  It has many options to personalized it to your taste and it is one of the rare games that allows adjustments for a right or left handed player.  What it is missing is a automatic &#34;End of Game&#34; message.  Would like to see that feature added as a future update.
B007MJSSCY|5.0|Ok, is there a movie where it bombs when Maggie Smith is in it?  I don't think so ... this was a surprise story and very heart-warming ... about a young boy learning about his family's history - knowing where you come from.  This is what I love about Europe - they actually care where they came from - their roots.  The story is told in a fanciful manner!  Watch it!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy this game! It's good fun for horse lovers. The graphics are quite good and the competitions are one of the best parts.

B002ZG99N6|5.0|The Town plot-wise is essentially the same as 'Heat' with a younger cast and set in Boston. That said, 'The Town' is a great movie. Kudos to Mr. Affleck both for his acting and his directing. Great also is Jeremy Renner as his unstable second in command and Blake Lively as his suffering X. I couldn't believe she was only like 23 when she did this movie. She comes across as someone much older and world weary. The whole movie is full of great supporting performers. Lots of things going on in this movie; struggles between class and family legacy. A great movie I never tire of watching.<br />By David Feeney, Author [[ASIN:B00CWRQAJY Terror On The High Seas]]
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I found the first two books better.  But I still liked this one very much.  Although Katniss' character gets a little much with all her agony.<br /><br />A \\"nice quaint\\" ending.  Not very exciting though.
B001TODCII|5.0|By David Feeney, Author [[ASIN:B00CWRQAJY Terror On The High Seas]]<br /><br />As I've said before, every decade has a film or two in the action genre that defines the age; Dirty Harry 70s, Lethal Weapon & First Blood 80s, Point Break 90s.<br /><br />I remember spotting a commercial for Taken on YouTube several months before the film arrived in the US. The film opened in Europe and made it's way slowly about the world. I kept tracking its earnings and was psyched to see it. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Taken is a relentless action film. When Brian Mills' (Neeson)daughter is taken by sex slave traders while on a trip to Paris, Mills, a former CIA special services type springs into action.<br /><br />Seldom does a move live up to it's trailer. Usually the trailer showcases the best action scenes to lure an audience in. Not so with Taken. Taken delivers on the promise of its trailer. Daughter taken + Daddy goes ballistic = lots of dead scumbags!<br /><br />I cannot overemphasize this last point. Every scene in this film serves only to give Neeson more people to kill...all to our delight. I saw this in a theater with a good crowd. People were cheering with every shattered skull, ruptured larynx, bullet between the eyes or steak knife to the heart. Neeson is a force of nature as he moves from one act of carnage to the next.<br /><br />He even shoots his friend's wife! How's that for badass?<br /><br />There's also some great dialogue to boot.<br /><br />'I'll tear down the Eiffel tower if I have to!' (He says this to his friend in the French Secret Service!)<br /><br />'Now's not the time for dick measuring, Stuart!' (He says this to his X-wife's new husband!)<br /><br />'You either give me what I need or this switch will stay on until they turn the power off for lack of payment on the bill.' (He says this to a dude he's electrocuting)<br /><br />and who could forget...<br /><br />'I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.'<br /><br />Jeepers. I'm ttrembling as I type this.<br /><br />Be warned, there's no philosophy here. No attempt to understand why they do what they do. Nobody plants a placenta in a garden or remembrance or any of that nonsense. Neeson just leaves the dirty buggers behind. I don't know how many people he kills in this movie. I tried to count but lost track in all the excitement.<br /><br />For those of you who haven't seen Taken see it. And just remember...there is a Taken 2. And yes, the dummies come after him again.<br /><br />But no, it's not as good as the first.<br /><br />Enjoy.I can tell you I don't have money.

B004NSULHM|5.0|That's right! Now before you angrily start the circulation of OK Computer biased hate on this review, I ask you to step back and read what I have to say.<br />The reason this is my favorite Radiohead album is because of it's amazing ability to grow on you. More than ANY other Radiohead album, this record feels real complete. As my top 2 Radiohead albums are In Rainbows and this one, I would compare this to In Rainbows in this way: When In Rainbows was released, it was their best album to date. Why? Because of it's magnificent perfection in how it flowed together so beautifully. This album has the same awesome flow, but it's more jagged. There's scattered ideas here, but they are PURPOSELY scattered. Especially when 'Feral' starts, that song to me is like all the ideas so far in the album tripped on a rock and fell all over the place. It's a beautiful mess, though. So basically, In Rainbows draws you in because of it's relaxed appeal, but this album is ambitious and spastic and draws you in with it's strange nature. I think In Rainbows and this album compliment each other. Since Radiohead's off their record label, these albums display Radiohead in a great stage of their career, experimenting without giving a plucked hen about what anyone else thinks. This album gets a perfect score of 100/100.<br />NOW GO ON AND HATE I DON'T GIVE A PLUCKED HEN EITHER
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I just love this show.  I love the characters, the boldness, and the clever attitude the entire law firm staff has.

B00BHWG0EK|1.0|I love Star Trek TNG and would give the whole series 4 and 5 stars.  I am giving this product 1 star, because I agree with the first reviewer.  Why release it again at such a high price? Itapparently has no extra features and the new packaging is obviously inferior to the first released dvd's.
B0020TS5LU|1.0|This DVD froze constantly and the color completely disappeared 15 minutes in.  This is the second DVD I have purchased from Amazon that had this problem.  I won't be ordering DVD's again.

Most of my co-workers stepped back and wouldn't touch it, even though I clearly showed them it was a toy-- and I had control of the remote. We've adopted him as mascot, even though NO ONE wants to sit with him or get too close. Great! (Note: you will need one of those itty bitty small phillips head screwdrivers in order to open the battery chamber).
B000LC4TJ0|1.0|I didn't even listen to the whole thing. I watched a few minutes, and listened to 30 seconds of the overture. And that's all you need. This is a nightmare Figaro from hell.<br /><br />I understand the impulse to take the great artists of the world (Shakespeare, Mozart) and update to make them more relevant. I honestly do. And sometimes the impulse to update works. For example, I saw a production of Schiller's Mary Stuart with the fabulous Janet McTeer on Broadway, and all the men were in suits. It was perfect, highlighting the ruthless and businesslike nature of the men who surrounded these women and attempted to use them for their own ends. To put them in capes and ruffs would be to hide their manipulation in romanticism. It made Schiller's themes all the more clear.<br /><br />But sometimes--particularly in a postmodern academic and artistic world--we take great works of art and \\"make them in our own image, in our own likeness\\" in a way that serves ourselves rather than the intentions of the artist. And this Figaro is such a one. It strikes me as revisionist for revisionist's sake--emperor's new clothes--trying to make Mozart into a man that has seen two World Wars and world wide epidemics. And--hate to break it to you Harnoncourt--Mozart was not a 21st century postmodernist. He simply was not, and to try and change his work so dramatically is to argue that his original vision (on surface level, opera buffa; but on a deep level, a profound commentary on marriage, money, and what makes people truly happy in the domestic sphere) doesn't matter. And I think his original vision did, does, and will matter.<br /><br />Moreover--Netrebko as Susanna!?!??! Who the HELL made that decision? She's bad enough as Mimi (seen at the Met in the gargantuan Zefirelli) but her Susanna is atrocious. She's a sexpot and a diva, and, don't get me wrong, I love her for it, but neither of those is either MiMi or Susanna. The whole POINT of Figaro is to contrast the incoming 19th century beogeoisie but contented fidelity with the outgoing 18th century aristocratic flippancy and heartbreak. And Netrebko cannot do contended (but clever) 19th century style beogeoisie. She cannot. I adore her Violetta, and I think she would make a brilliant Tosca (though apparently she thinks she's too cool for that). But Susanna? Give me a woman like Elizabeth Bennet vocally: witty, clever, sharp, but at her core, modest, virtuous, and fiercely faithful to those she loves. Casting her was perhaps the biggest mistake in opera history.<br /><br />If you care about Mozart's original vision of mischief and good-humor, with a subtle message on marriage and money, (once again, the analogy to Jane Austen seems appropriate), spend your money on the Solti recording with the London Phil. No one can beat Sameul Ramey (except perhaps Bryn Terfel, also seen at the Met). TeKanawa is......lovely TeKanawa; indescribably elegant and mournful. The energetic Lucia Popp sounds like her name: full of quickness, cleverness and vitality. And Fredica VonStade? Wonderful as Cherubino.<br /><br />As far as DVD goes, I think the recent David McVicar production plays up the sexual tension in such a way that makes it accessible to modern viewers and non-opera goers, so I'd strongly recommend that one. Spend my Fourth of July (of all days!) ironing and watching it. That is an example of an successful update (though could we truly call it that? It's only to the 1830's, where the Count and Countess seems even more outdated in the century that loves the individual and the non-aristocratic). It succeeds in making Figaro slightly darker and less merry without plunging wholeheartedly into the abyss in the way that Harnoncourt does. Honestly--we have the Requiem, which is plenty dark. WHY do we need to darken Nozze di Figaro? Other than to pat ourselves on the back and congratulate ourselves for how fresh and modern we are? It smacks of arrogance, truly. Don't waste your time; don't soil your soul.

B005S9EKCW|5.0|I watched this last night. Still choked up today. Casting was superb, very well chosen. Acting was tremendous. Some reviewers criticized the singing of some of the actors, but in this adaptation I think the acting skills mattered more. Where voice talent was needed most, it was supplied by Ann Hathaway and Samantha Barks. Ann Hathaway (Fantine) delivered such a powerful and sadly too short performance-that's the character-though she reappears at the end as a heavenly apparition. Her performance alone is enough to want this movie. A tale of almost superhuman Christian forgiveness and charity-could be a parable. A definite must see.

B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Had me on my edge of the seat. As soon as I finished one episode, I was ready for the next, but didn't want to watch to fast because I wanted to take it all in and give it time to brew in my mind. It's been three weeks since I finished watching the entire season, and scenes still pop into my mind. Highly recommend to those who love dark movies. Nice twists, and unexpected turns. Highly enjoyable.

B007TK77QE|4.0|After reading it twice I found the book frustrating but also enlightening in terms of character development.<br />I felt truly sorry for Krystal in the end and it was very tragic but I think that it may well serve as lesson in humanity and seeing life from someone else's point of view.<br />I would hope that compassion could win over greed, selfishness and arrogance in similar circumstances.<br />Rowling shines a torch on a disfunctional community and therefore shows us ways to change this in the real world.
B0064NTZQ2|2.0|First, the handwritten typography reminds me a lot of 'Silk Stalkings'<br />Nothing wring with that but I can't help wondering why<br /><br />For a show titled 'Drive', car scenes are minimal<br /><br />The lighting and use of silence try to make this show edgy and dark<br />And in a way, it is a preparation for the increasing brutal violence<br /><br />I would have preferred action over mindless violence<br />And the use of blood and gore as accessories<br /><br />Nice haunting music<br /><br />In the end, I found too much unnecessary violence<br />I don't mean the violence was unnecessary<br />But the way it was inflicted and the director's treatment<br />(Not giving details so as not to spoil the show for those who have not watched it)<br /><br />The show tried hard to stay away from typical Hollywood predictability<br />If you like very paced shows with a lot of blood, go for it<br />If you like moody, pseudo film noir without violence, perhaps give this a miss

0307476464|3.0|If nothing else, 1Q84 really stimulated my dream generator at night.  I had some of the strangest erotic images, new fantastic images, and aggressive moments in my dreams in the weeks of reading this odd book.  Though I disliked the repetition of the writing, it also allowed me to read a couple chapters before I went to bed and remember the plot.  The translation was fine.  I won't rehash the plot.  I agree with previous reviewers NOT to read this book first if you are not familiar with Murakami.  The Wind Up Bird Chronicle is far superior, more concise.  There is certainly enough slow brewing suspense to motivate reading to the end, but the ending?  Loose ends with the Dowager I would have liked to see clarified.  I was unhappy with the ending...almost too pat. Unlike the likelihood of my reading \\"Wind Up Bird Chronicle\\" again...I doubt that I would ever want to read 1Q84 twice.  If there is one image that comes to mind...The Garden of Early Delights by Hieronymous Bosch--complete with goats, funny groups of people, odd and not so odd eroticism, strange birds all thrown together...depicts this strange novel.<br /><br />I am looking forward to \\"South of the Border, West of the Sun.\\"
B004YXE438|1.0|this is a first for me it says it is free but when you go to download,  it says the price has changed since I looked at it.  then I cancel the download a go back an it is still advertised as free!!!!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app has been updated and is MUCH better than it was before. You CAN mix sounds without a problem and adjust the volume according to your needs. It has a stop button that allows you to stop the app before you leave so it is not playing in the backround.<br />I would definately reccommend this app as a sound machine.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is a very fun game for all ages. I would sugest it for anyone. if your kids get bord they will love this game
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I would give this a 5, but I am having trouble with some of the functionality. For instance: When I try to mix any of the feeds that have more than 2 ingredients, I can't get the bucket to move to any of  the other ingredients, so I have ended up wasting gold AND gems on horse feed recipes that I can't even finish.<br /><br />Another problem I've run into is the paddock cleaning game. The premise goes that if you're given a rake you're supposed to clear a weed and if you're given a shovel you're supposed to clear a dung heap. It took me over 10 minutes to complete one of those games because I'd try to click on one of the appropriate messes and I'd get no response. I had to click around the screen like a random madwoman to have things cleared away. It was ridiculous.<br /><br />Has anyone else had any of these problems? I would love any advice I could get.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Great book to read. Can not wait to start the next book in this series. A must read series for all.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Great book. Actually liked this book better than the first.  This book gets more involved with the characters and their places in the series.  Looking forward to the next book.
B0085Z8F4A|2.0|Knowing that this movie is set in the &#34;Alien&#34; universe and timeline, I really wanted to love this movie, or even like it.  I don't have to dive in to the horrible &#34;jigsaw&#34; plot, as others have already done this.  The only reason this gets 2 stars instead of 1 is due to some really good acting.  Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to save itself from all of the plot holes.

1439153663|2.0|While I didn't vehemently dislike this novel, once into it I read it quickly because it didn't absorb me. It reminded me of a romance novel with weak characterizations and emphasis on plot. The main character, Lavinia, true to romance genre, grows up to be a beauty (altho a very dumb one), amazingly myopic in her evaluation of people and inability to steer her own life effectively. The characters are cardboard, either all good or all bad. Not much nuance in either plot or characters. By dumb luck and not brains everything turns out perfectly for Lavinia -- she frees the slaves, runs a successful farm and lives happily every after.

B00B1ME3DQ|4.0|I read in an interview by guitarist of clutch Tim Sult, he said it was to be the heaviest album by clutch to date. I was excited by those words. Really heavy clutch, cool right? Well...its songs, save one, are fast paced, but so is all their stuff, even the jazzier funky-er ones. But heaviest ever? Hardly. See Pitchfork & Transitional Speedway for comparison. And Blast Tyrant. And the lyrics don't seem as inspired as all, I repeat, all of the previous albums. Could Clutch be loosing their edge finally? Maybe it will grow on me...all clutch albums have been that way for me. But always because they were so differient from their previous releases it would take me awhile to hear what is was they were trying to accomplish with a new album. This one though, was just...uninspired sounding. They don't seem to be pushing any envelopes with this this one, not even any paper clips. There are a few instantly likeable songs. Earth Rocker, Crucial Velocity & Gone Cold are a few. But no guitar riffs that sound genius or original. Its still better than all the other rock garbage out there by a mile. But I'm still disappointed with this one even after fourth and fifth listens to it. Its almost like they did this one because it was expected, not because they were inspired to. Hmmm...I just don't know what to make of it...its kind of forgettable. Words I thought I would never say about a Clutch Cd. Maybe they just set the bar too high with Beale St. And everything else up to Earth Rocker and it would have been a tour de'  force from anyone else. I will listen to it more and perhaps add to this review later.<br /><br />Oh...and they brought the pure rock at the Dallas tx show for sure. But was a \\"fan favorite\\" set. Wish they had played some of the songs that not everyone on the planet says are their favorite clutch songs. If they had played \\"Mr Shiny Cadillackness\\" that would have made my year. And J.P. came out for the hard core wait around fans, got an autograph on my copy of LIVE ATTHE HI-FI BAR, my absolute favorite clutch Cd. Next best thing to seeing them that Cd is. I don't mean to brag...no, I do. I'm definatley bragging, it was an awesome night!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|this was a nice, relaxing brain candy type of read.  Really enjoyed it, did not see the movie, but daughter said the book was best so glad I didn't see the movie
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This is one of the old movies that all the critics say is great and know what? They are correct.
014241493X|4.0|And the last book I read on John Green Box Set. Among the four this is on second place. And also I think John Green gets better with every book he releases.<br />And also this confirms my theory that I have said in my review about An Abundance of Katherines. Nerd Guy gets affected by and Enigmatic Female. (Although he changed his formula with TFIOS)<br /><br />What I like about this book is how good the female is. Among all the female characters he used in his books, Margo for me has the most character and is the type of character that had many layers in her personality and you see a depth in that character.<br /><br />Q, I found him a little irritating at times and also very obsessed. So in contrast among all John's male character he is my least favorite. His bestfriends are actually much more cooler and interesting for me.<br /><br />But yup why did I like the story? I like how \\"detective\\"-themed this book is. They are searching for clues all thoughout the book up to the end and its really fun for me when they discover the breadcrumbs left for Q to follow. Also the pacing is the best. I think every part is interesting and important to the story (boring parts are minimal).<br /><br />And also the most important to me in this book is that I saw a story which shows that people are not 2-dimensional. They are not paper with personalities like Black and White. We can see that there can be a million sides to a person's personality.<br /><br />I am not a psychologist, but for me I just interpreted the Paper in this book that people have layers of personality, people can be fragile, people can be mysterious, and people sometimes just want to be free and fly to wherever it wants to go. And also sometimes that falseness of a person wherein we just see whatever it wants us to see.<br /><br />The adventure and events here in this book  is light hearted but at the same time heavy I think. I like the dynamics of the characters.<br /><br />All in all I give this book 4 whales.

B00ADGSIRS|5.0|During his time as a member of Kraftwerk,Karl Bartos was apparently something of a musical archivist-using a number of tape machines to record different synthsizer,computer and electric keyboard loops and snippets that were floating around as raw material as Kraftwerk were producing the music that would be so massively influential to future generations. Karl knew they would probably be of some use to him,someday. But he didn't know exactly when. Then came a period between 2010 and this release where,in the midst of conceptualizing his next album,he decided it was now appropriate to construct some type of form out of all the unfinished bits and pieces he had taped during Kraftwerk's fruitful constructivist period. So he added his own new album concept into fleshing out these musical archives,and the result is this new album.<br /><br />  Not surprisingly this album has the flavor of a classic Kraftwerk album in their heyday. But there's a very strong individual flavor as well. \\"Atomium\\" opens the album,a very orchestral and cinematic venture atypical of Kraftwerk's more stripped down approach. It sounds like the opening of a feature film almost until snippets of vocoderized conversation about the rise and fall of the atomic age kick in,and one realizes it's something else.  \\"Nachtfahrt\\",\\"International Velvet\\" and even the largely instrumental closer \\"Hausmusik\\" are all happily melodic,minimal electronic pop firmly in the late 70's Kraftwerk tradition of the form. \\"Without A Trace Of Emotion\\" and \\"The Tuning Of The World\\" strike more somber chords,as a longing for a grand creative subculture and,with no irony lost,a sense of humanity even in electronic music making up the lyrical form of these songs.<br /><br />  \\"The Binary Code\\" is a nearly two minute embodiment of \\"the video game sound\\" synthesizer composition in action,likely a taped loop unmixed from it's approach. The almost industrial house approach of \\"Musica Ex Machina\\" as well as the far more experimental sound abstractions of \\"Instant Bayreuth\\",\\"Vox Humana\\" and \\"Rhythmus\\". These songs are a lot more complex rhythmically and melodically. And sound as if they come from the mid 80's as Kraftwerk were regrouping to record as they reflect the influence of electro-funk/hip-hop to some degree. There is a flavor to this album of a compilation of unreleased Kraftwerk material. But if one digs a little deeper there's quite a lot more of Karl Bartos the individual as well. He has a thoughtful and reflective personality,illustrated in the in depth liner notes on this CD,that comes across loud and clear on his musical and lyrical choices. It's an excellent recording I highly recommend to anyone who has a strong interest in Kraftwerk and the electronic music revolution in general.und abstractions of \\"Instant Bayreuth\\",\\"Vox Humana\\" and \\"Rhythmus\\".

B005EHILV4|4.0|I use this unit to interface between my studio monitors and my Macbook Pro, which it does very well. It is indeed Plug and Play, and works nicely with both Logic Pro, Ableton Live and my Macbook's audio settings. However, be prepared to spend a few minutes figuring out the audio settings on the unit itself in order to get sound recorded into your software.<br /><br />My major gripe is, I bought the unit after reading \\"Phantom Powered\\" in its description, and I was expecting it to work with my AKG condenser mic. Not being a real audio professional, it was an especially confusing process for me, because if you are using the unit's headphone out, you will be able to hear the condenser mic and it'll sound full, even if it's not getting the proper voltage of phantom power, but it won't transfer that fullness to the recorded sound. The label on this product makes you think you're getting true 48v power, and it takes, in my opinion, too much searching to find out that you're really not - it's actually something in the range of 11v to 15v. This seems almost like false advertising.<br /><br />After getting an external phantom power unit (accomplished for about $20 - [[ASIN:B000XUUXB8 Nady SMPS-1X 1-Channel 48V Phantom Power Supply for SCM Series Microphones]], I finally was able to record with my condenser mic and it does a great job - clean sound that, with the right setup in Logic (which can take a little effort), doesn't have any delay/latency issues. I haven't gotten it to play totally nice with Ableton yet, but the sound quality is still good.<br /><br />One more complaint - if you are a sound amateur like me, don't expect the unit to be able to record your electric guitar directly from the instrument. Sound pros would probably read the last sentence and scoff with sound pro haughtiness at its ignorance, but I thought the included preamp on this unit might eliminate the need for an external amp before running your instrument cable into the mic input. Not the case - you still need to connect your guitar to an actual amp first (as far as I know).still need to connect your guitar to an actual amp first (as far as I know).

0316187216|5.0|Shy is a hard woman with a dark past. Lamb is a giant of a man and a bloody coward. But he's the closest thing to a father Shy and her two young siblings is ever going to have. When Shy finds her farm burnt to the ground and her young brother and sister taken, Shy and Lamb take off cross country to find them. It is a journey that will cost them everything they are.<br /><br />\\"What do we do if we catch them?\\" she muttered, keeping her voice down. \\"Chances are they're going to be armed and willing. Better armed than us, that's sure.\\"<br /><br />\\"Recon we'll have to be more willing then.\\"<br /><br />There are many detailed characters in Red Country but none is as riveting as Lamb, a quiet man who kept his head bowed for years, farming, raising children that weren't his own. Perhaps the story of Lamb draws from too many familiar tropes (the lone warrior, ronin, etc.) but Lamb's journey, dialogue, and challenges haunted me weeks after finishing the book.<br /><br />  I didn't want no trouble,\\" said Lamb. \\"It blew in anyway. Trouble's got a habit that way.\\" He pushed his wet hair out of his face, and his eyes were wide open, bright, bright, mouth open too, breathing fast, and he was smiling. Not like a man working his way up to a hard task. Like a man enjoying getting to a pleasant one, taking his time about it like you might over a fine meal, and of a sudden Shy saw all those scars anew, and felt this coldness creeping up her arms and down her back and every hair on her standing.<br /><br />Elsewhere Captain General Nicomo Cosca leads The Company of the Gracious Hand, a fierce bunch of mercenary murderers and thieves, accompanied by a feckless lawyer named Temple. The Company of the Gracious Hand has been hired by the inquisition to route hidden pockets of rebels, which they mean to do by burning and pillaging their way across the country. It's a red country indeed.<br /><br />This is a fantastic book that spans many characters, miles of travel, and battles. No one ends the journey unscathed, definitely not Lamb who turns out to have a much richer and darker past than Shy ever suspected. Abercrombie's First Law trilogy is also fantastic but the characters are so dark that you almost stop caring about them. In Red Country, Shy, Temple, and definitely Lamb are dark, broken characters and yet you never stop rooting for them to succeed. They are forced into many hard choices, each with a hefty price to pay, and each conflict brings an uneasy resolution. Yet the dialogue has so much sly wit and humor that the book never seems TOO dark or bleak. There is a spark of hope and warmth that keeps the balance.<br /><br />Joe Abercrombie is a modern master of the anti-hero and Red Country is his best work to date. I highly recommend.the journey unscathed, definitely not Lamb who turns out to have a much richer and darker past than Shy ever suspected.

B003L0V758|5.0|The ArchAndroid is an incredible concept album with many elements that will be lost on a lot of fans of your typical, safe, radio R&B. It follows the story of Cindi Mayweather, an android, and Anthony Greendown, a human. Weird, right? Genius! Though there are some clear mainstream standouts like Tightrope and Cold War, each song should be listened to in order so that the listener can follow the unfolding story. The first track, Suite II Overture is a beautifully composed orchestral piece, which sets the stage for the rest of the album. A personal favorite of mine is 57821, featuring Deep Cotton. Not only do I find the melodies beautifully haunting, but the lyrics really draw you into the story. The final track, BaBopByeYa is a perfect ending to this musical display of an album. It really showcases Janelle's amazing vocal talent. Her voice just seamlessly weaves itself in and around the music, neither one overpowering the other, but fitting together perfectly to convey the mood of the album.<br /><br />Janelle Monae is truly a musical genius, and I look forward to being able to see her live. It's sad that the industry keeps categorizing her as R&B Neo-Soul. I enjoy these genres, but to lump her in with those types of artists is a mistake.

B007REV4YI|5.0|I didn't really care for Quantum of Salace, but this one was a really good bond movie. If you are a Bond fan I would recommend getting this one.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|An absolutely delightful production.  There are surprises galore!  Can't wait for season 4!  One of the best series I've seen.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|It's quite frankly astonishingly brief, captivating and inspiring. Must read for all who still grapple with the notion that NK isn't a problem worth addressing.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|I must say that upon first listening, I found Spirits Of The Western Sky simply okay. My admiration of Justin Hayward's talents required that I give the music more than one chance. I'm certainly glad I did. The songs on the CD grow on you with repeated listenings. I now rank the music as some of his best. Though still undecided on the final two electronic takes on I Know You're Out There Somewhere, I give this CD two thumbs up.
B007HO392S|5.0|I love her, I think she has a fantastic voice and this cd, once again shows it. Great songs and love Two Black Cadillacs and of course Blown Away.  Also happy that it was included in the auto-rip catagory as i purchased this for a friends birthday and i got the free auto rip of it!!  Score!!
B00BCZU8WM|1.0|Wow mr. timberlake, What the hell happened there this album was a stinker the only good song on this album was &#34;blue ocean floor&#34; and the critically acclaimed hit song &#34;mirrors&#34; other than that boycott this trash, if it wasn't for mirrors being a hit then this album would have been one of those &#34;one hit wonder&#34; albums which i can definitely say is the case here, there's nothing new here all the tracks from track 1 all the way to track 8 sucked, most of these tracks lack diversity, composition, passion etc. I could go on and on this album overall is very mediocre, save your time, save your money. I think it's pretty much time for mr. timberlake to call it quits on his career because this album was god awful.
B004TI5N38|3.0|The story was going well but when Sam was a casualty that turned it for me.  She could have made the ending more believable rather than sit and describe the crime at the end.  It was like 300 pages of lead up at 20 of making it all make sense.  Could have been a lot smoother and Sam didn't need to die.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Keeps you hooked until the end. I could not put the book down and finished it in record time. I will definitely reread this multiple times
B008FTAAG2|5.0|By a happy squence of events I stumbled on \\"Blood.\\"  That song was the first song I have ever heard from In this Moment.  After the first time hearing it, I couldn't wait to get home and check out some more by this band.<br /><br />There are other In this Moment albums out there and I have previewed them all.  None of them capture me like this has.  The others just sound like screaming and bad screaming at that. I wouldn't drop a dime on a different CD by In this Moment.  This review isn't coming from a die hard fan of this band.<br /><br />This CD has a great balance of showing off what the lead singer can do.  The band brings that edge to the lyrics and her vocals to make this CD into a great showcase of what the band is now.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is so fun! but glitches and makes me fall off the cliff.but great deal.You should get this app... all my cousins play it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really love love love all of these books.  It was so informative.  I couldn't put the book down.  I can't wait for the movie to come out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it. it's so fun I can play it all day long. if you get the Easter one you can get 100 eggs it's so fun. :(@)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really love love love all of these books.  It was so informative.  I couldn't put the book down.  I can't wait for the movie to come out.
B001GCUO16|5.0|Wolverine has always been my favorite X man. And i doubt anyone but Hugh Jackman could play him so well. This story of his origin is exciting with great special effects. Liev Schriber as his brother is great
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really love love love all of these books.  It was so informative.  I couldn't put the book down.  I can't wait for the movie to come out.
0425252868|5.0|I first learned of this book through a review in my Sunday paper.  I waited until it was available on Kindle to purchase it.  The wait was more than worthwhile.  This book would have been an interesting read even if it had been a novel. But, as a true story, well told and written by Mr. Makos, it is a very, very special work!!<br /><br />It is very hard for those of us who were brought up during the 40,s to realize that there were \\"good men\\" in the armies opposing our forces during the war with Germany.  Mr. Makos informs us of a virtuous but nationalistic German pilot (an ace no less!) who showed extraordinary compassion for a wounded opponent in the heat of battle.<br /><br />Mr. Tom Brokow rightly named the men and women of the 30's and 40's The Greatest Generation.  Not only is that true; but, in some cases, this epitaph may also be applied to some of the opposition.  The Greatest Generation is almost all lost to us now; it is worth remembering their bravery, self-sacrifice, and often, nobility as examples to those who follow.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Trying to get a better outlook and my life presception.  Was recommended my a fellow counterpart.  Was very interested in reading
B009R5GR1K|5.0|I love this app for my kindle. I use it mostly when doing my homework and have had nothing but ease. I highly recommend this app.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I was not disappointed with this latest edition and I think anyone who is a fan will be happy with it.  Can't wait for the next one.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love it, it's very comfortable, it has many compartments for any kind of camera gear. It's big enough to carry all my camera (body), 2 lenses, lens hoods, charger, etc...and also The price is amazing!!!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I loved this story because it had everything.  It's a spy thriller with lots of WWII spy stuff but with an unexpected romance.  It sort of reminded me of the end of the original King Kong movie after he's been killed and he's laying there dead and they ask if the planes got him. The answer was something like it was beauty who killed the beast because his love for her was his demise. The spy is a ruthless cold hearted killer but he completely falls for her.  I would bet a man or a woman would love this book.
B00849F82E|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone looking to expand and understand on a deeper level their faith. .
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Long ago, in a far off distant land/time known as 1985, I remember waking up and going into the living room and seeing a wrapped box and hoping that it was a Nintendo. And that feeling of hope and of excitement when it was opened and it was a Nintendo is the same feeling that I got from watching this film. Simply put, the creators of this movie know what it was like to be a kid in the 80s, playing nintendo or some games at an arcade (I was a huge Pac-Man fan).<br /><br />The story revolves around a \\"bad guy\\" in the game Wreck It Ralph. Ralph has been wrecking for 30 years but he is bored by it and just wants to be accepted by the denizens of the house he keeps wrecking. Those people do love Fix-It-Felix, and Ralph wants some of that love. I sympathize with Ralph. I get where he is coming from and he makes for a good protagonist for our story.<br /><br />The story really kicks it into gear when Ralph leaves his video game, traveling down wires to a Game Junction and goes in search of a medal that he thinks will get him accepted by the people of his game. We see a world at war with alien bugs and a world of candy where people race for accolades. But something sinister is going on in the Sugar Rush. Along the way Ralph ends up causing havoc in two different games but really, he learns a few things and helps a few people and watching it all play out is really wonderful.<br /><br />This is the fifty-second Disney animated feature and I haven't been so excited by one since the Disney Renaissance of the late 80s when Little Mermaid, Beauty and The Beast, The Lion King and Aladdin all came out. The movie is beautiful. The characters are awesome and the movie left me wanting to watch even more.
B00BMVTTJ4|1.0|Really, I love fantasy and sci-fi and am self professed nerd but this was totally overblown crap. Could of cared less about the characters, the dramatic 'monologues' sappy and insipid, and at least in the first series I felt some respect was paid to the source material not so here. I won't drop another dime into this&#34;trilogy&#34;.
B0091REZMW|5.0|It grows on you.  I wish it regenerated energy faster because you have to wait a lot to play but when you do play it is great.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is definitely a favorite of mine.  You have to see ahead several moves or you never finish the game.
B0074QGGK6|4.0|Lately I've had the feeling that I'm not actually equipped to write what I want. This book has very basic advice but that's exactly what I needed. Plus, I want to be writing, not spending hours over self help texts. This was short and sweet; I can go on my way feeling like I have some direction without having wasted time.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Although the game feels a lot like Pandemic, there's definitely less of a lucky factor and much more control, the Neurax Worm and Necroa Virus are wonderful additions, for its price it's a ton of fun.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|The Night Circus is a beguiling tale of how love & dreams abound.  Some are meant to be and others not.  Each character is painted through the eyes of the author as a masterpiece of mystery.  Thoroughly descriptive and enchanting, the reader becomes pulled into a vivid,dream like state and experiences wonderment in all character's and scenes.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I wanted to read before the movie. So glad I did. The way the author tells this story is captivating. I highly recommend.
6305622914|5.0|I ENJOYED THIS WHEN I SAW IT AT THE SHOW.  IT'S VERY FUNNY, GOOD STORY, BUT YOU NEED TO WATCH IT MORE THAN ONCE BECAUSE OF THE ENGLISH ACCENTS.
B009VMN3RA|4.0|Was not exactly what I expected but in the end it was worth reading. Remember there is always three sides to every story. Yours, mine and the truth.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|No educational value, but my four year old daughter loves this movie! My daughter watches these movies over and over again. She loves everything Monster High.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The beginning of the book was good, but as it went on, the story was dragged out when they were making their way to the Capitol. I was expecting the end of the book to be more exciting too.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|One of the best games I have played.  Makes you think and pay attention this details. Addictive, can play for hours!
B0099Y2YL6|4.0|Downton Abbey is one of those shows that is worth having on Blu Ray. The production is wonderful. Both my wife and I can watch it over and over again and see more and more with each viewing. If you are a Downton Abbey fan, treat yourself to the Blu Ray version.
0316017930|5.0|This book is great in the way it applies logic to explain the unusual. The many case studies examined by the author are fascinating and insightful, often relating extraordinary success to common sense, hard work, and extensive practice as opposed to mystery and prodigy. The book provides lessons we can all use in practical application.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this and I just got it today. Beautiful animation and fun mini games. For anyone who loves horses. :)
B00AB0Z88S|1.0|I bought this Video After seeing the Academy Awards and seeing it was nominated for 11 awards.. the clip and visiuals were beautiful.. BUT.. I paid $28.00 for this in 3D.. It was awful!!!  Soo disappointing.. I want my money back!!!
B009XWD02G|1.0|This app sucks...it won't let me download any songs It just makes a fart noise whenever I try to get one -_- don't get it just save yourself the time
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Took forever to download. Once it finally did it would lock up and force close. A huge waist of my time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Beautiful graphics and audio it really helps me loose time. The horses movements were extremely realistic and the different activities are amusing and wonderful. I recommend this product it was absolutely worth the time.
B004SUDQE0|5.0|It is a plain and simple film.  Just sit back and enjoy.  You don't have to wade thru computer generated anything.  Breathtaking scenery.  Microcosmic village.  The measuring of this mountain was possibly the most exciting thing to ever happen to them.  It gave them a chance to exercise their sense of morality, physical wherewithal and sense of community as well as religious faith.
B00095NX9G|5.0|I watched a lot of belly dancing on youtube and Rachel Brice really hit me. I'm a beginner and would like to do it right, somehow it's frustrated sometimes when I go to the belly dancing studio. The instructor did not really know my problem and I did not really understand her explanation. I'm now practicing with Rachel's DVD, and I have to say I'm getting to know, to feel some thing about belly dancing. Thanks to the DVD and thanks a lot to Rachel Brice. I'm sure I can get back to the studio and know what's going on there and catch up.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Dude you've got to buy this game! Its AWESOME!!!! If you dont like it (wich i find impossible) then you are a BIG FAT LOSER! So unless you DO want to be a FAT LOSER, BUY THIS GAME NOW!!!!

B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's sooo realistic I feel like I'm running through the jungle. I would definitely recommend this game. It's way better than Temple Run 1
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love a book that grabs my interest right away and Hopeless did just that.  I couldn't put it down.  The relationship between Sky and Holder was so special it made me want to cry.  They had so many issues to deal with in their young lives and had no one to turn to except each other.  Holder had some serious issues in his life, yet he was so gentle an patient with Sky.  It was the 1st book I have read written by Colleen Hoover but have now ordered the others.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Having watched the Academy Awards and then seeing [[ASIN:B00AHTYGRW Argo (Blu-ray/DVD Combo+UltraViolet Digital Copy)]] and now Zero, I can tell you that in my opinion the better movie didn't win. As noted, it was felt the controversial depiction of torture lead to a snub by the Academy. Shame. Anyway, this is the more cerebral of the two recent movies on the killing of Bin Laden. The other being, [[ASIN:B00A34LXEK Seal Team Six: The Raid On Osama Bin Laden [Blu-ray]]] which focused mostly on the Seals training for the operation. Zero instead spends the first part of the movie focusing on the CIA and in particularly, Maya, the analyst who realizes that the key to getting to Bin Laden is through his courier. The last quarter of the movie being the actual raid.<br /><br />The transfer itself is excellent and the soundtrack was excellent during scenes with explosives and firefights. The disappointing part is the quality of extra features, none lasting more than 10 minutes. Maybe a collectors edition will come out but we are all still waiting for one for director Katheryn Bigelow's last big hit, [[ASIN:B00275EGX8 Hurt Locker [Blu-ray]]].<br />.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE SUBWAY SURFER IT IS AWESOME!!!! Love the great graphics! It has great sound but the prices for your characters are a bit overboard. But keep up the great job!!!!
B008220C38|3.0|Love the lead actress but in this Keira is not particularly good or even well cast.<br />And it pains me to say that... see below.<br /><br />I love the director... his Pride and Prejudice was extremely well done... different than the equally well done BBC version... from years before... but in this case... the creative idea of using the same stage to tell the story... although admittedly clever and well worked out... simply narrows the great panoply of human emotions and breadth of political comment and historical moment that is so precious in the story.<br /><br />It was a very interesting idea that nearly destroyed its host.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Ms Knightley or of theater... and/or the book... or of 18th/19th Century historical centered... stories in general... then certainly you should see the movie.<br />But I think you will notice the same problems... you will like the movie... but like it less as the days go on.<br /><br />The idea of mixing a 50s look with the 19th century was clever in the costumes... and extremely... well realize. Yes the gowns are beautiful creations that look like they might have taken off in that day... still I don't fault that change... the gowns of that day... giant hooped dresses... are not appealing to our eye.<br /><br />Hint to Ms Knightly:<br />Your girlish charms that are so appealing and your loving spirit especially... of other humans that comes so well through in much of your work ... should be your guide.<br />Although expanding your psychic perception in your movie fans... is a common demand of agents and of your own creative needs... what is more important is that you take your unique personality on the screen and use it to create a moral comment.<br /><br />Sounds strange... but dose humanity ever today need to remember its moral foundations and real... \\"conserved\\" moral actions... and the consequences of immoral actions too... for they are what is almost totally missing from movies as we are being programed toemulate... in real life... the West's downfall.<br /><br />Those who tell you that you must carry the newest social crest of change are liars, rather... restate ancient values in your chose of scrips because your spirit of playful interest in others an self effacement with laughter... that came so clearly through in Pride and Prejudice... is desperately needed.
030758836X|5.0|Once I started this book, it &#34;grabbed&#34; me.  I read it during every spare moment over two days.  Can't wait to discuss it with the rest of my book club.  The two main characters, while fascinating, were also disgusting in their self-immersion, disregard of the law and of the feelings of others.  They deserve each other, but since they also impact the lives of others, I wish they could be punished in some way (other than by each other) for their behavior.  Interesting and enjoyable manner of story telling, different from most I've read.  Well worth the purchase price.
B0097JYVAU|5.0|Souffle statistics.<br />Light, but leaves room for more.<br /><br />Some interesting pictures of some very colorful characters.<br />Worth a read? Yes.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Liked this game.  The graphics are clean and crisp. Would buy other games from developer.  There were enough levels to keep me busy for awhile but I didn't get bored. :-)
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|As stated above we (my four year old and I) love this movie. It is wonderfully done, Pitch (the boogie man) has enough creepiness, but doesn't go over the top. We just shared this movie with friends who have children ranging from 2 to 6 with rave reviews as well. It reminds children to BELIEVE as well as encourages them to conquer their fears. It shows them that THEY are in charge of what they are afraid of, fear is not stronger that belief. I just love the animation, the fun spin on traditions and ideas...who ken that, THAT was how all those eggs were hidden at Easter?! I highly recommend this movie over and over again.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I LOOOOOOOOOOVVVVVE THIS GAME SOOOOOOO MUCH MORE THAN ANY OTHER GAME.especially when I'm bored.I love it so much I love love love love it
B000FCJZ4K|4.0|This book was given to me by a dear friend who thought the theses laid out in the book would resonate with me. They did resonate indeed. It was nice to read Mr. Ferrazzi's anecdotes and be reminded that if you first seek to help others, countless rewards you shall receive. Great book and I highly commend it to others!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The walking dead is the best show I've ever seen! Not only is there suspense and zombie killing but there's also a great storyline involved in the show. If u have never seen the show u should really take the time to watch all the episodes from the very first season.

B0089AD8IO|5.0|This was the return of a favorite character of mine, loved the original but this steps it up quite a few notches.  A great series starter and a must see to understand the series that come after
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had a lot of meaning. About things I can relate to and life it's self. I will tell every girl I know to read it. This is one of my all time favorite books. I felt like I was right there in the story living it with the characters. This is a must read!
B004RQVVGU|4.0|Why is Amazon advertising the 2011 Legacy edition of this product, but displaying the reviews of the 2002 version of this?????<br />I want to know what people who have bought THIS version think, NOT the 2002 version.<br />Wake up whoever is in charge; you are deterring potential customers with negative reviews.<br />I know the 2002 version is crap, what about the 2011 version with the restored original bass and drums?<br />NOTE: I rated this only because I had to in order to get this question out there, I have not heard it yet.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Help kids learn responsibility. It is a fun game and keeps the kids interested and coming back. My girls love playing and now I'm hooked on it. They like the training and grooming the horse. Keeps them entertained for hours.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|Enjoyed having watched it. Had no problems<br />and really liked this version better. x x x x x x x
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I have had this game for a while now and I play it every day.  I am so glad that I found this game and that my friends showed me how to upgrade to Subway Surfers Rome.
B0030BOCEG|5.0|I own all the albums, HIM has been my favorite band now for 8yrs. This album to me, is very inspiring and beautiful. I like this album because it feels as Ville is pouring his heart out, in these lyrics and it's very beautiful. I love the range on his voice, the nice smoothness and soothing sound of voice as he sings these poetic lyrics. I simply adore this album. I would definitely recommend this album.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|They did a very good job converting the book into tv. Not an easy task at the best of times. If you enjoyed season 1 then season 2 is better.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I'm addicted to this game. Now I'm a level 14 and my whole family is playing it. If you are reading this download this app. :)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am not a fan of post-apocalyptic stories, but downloaded based on the high ratings.<br />Absolutely devoured this book. And the next. Can't wait for more.<br />Hugh Howie writes incredibly well.<br />Characters are great and developed to where one cares about them.<br />Story is tight, and flows exactly where you want it to go.<br />New, relevant and interesting twists around many corners.<br />In my opinion there is absolutely no weak point anywhere in this story.<br />Whatever Hugh Howie writes, I'm reading.<br />Look out Hugh, another buck heading your way!
B00A85EMVK|5.0|why they were not 3d in 80's, i hope to see it on a bigger screen, but not in france ...
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We love the closed captioning as my husband is hard of hearing and the accent makes it difficult to catch all of the words.  It arrived quickly and in great condition.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Im addicted to this game. It is very fun. Has many rank ups and a lot of levels to play on!
B005AC65TS|3.0|..but to be fair, I really became a fan during the early 90's and thought he peaked around Perfectly Good Guitar and Little Head. Nine times out of ten, I'll just put the Live album on shuffle and blast my eardrums. This is a well-executed production, just not that much of what I like from Hiatt.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I liked it so much I got another one of her books. It is also very good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is so fun it can get hard but its so fun I think that you should consider making it money if people like it as much as I do they will buy for so much money

B000MGATTE|5.0|I am currently rereading this book. I love this book. I am quite sure Mr. King's near death and subsequent rehab time with his wife Tabitha gave them a lot of time to talk about their marriage. I consider this book to be a love letter to Tabitha King, and a way to acknowledge that even though she is as famous, that she is his love. I find that to be a wonderful thing... why bother with wealth and fame if you don't have love? I almost lost my husband in a car accident and went through the rehab, PT and OT... and post concussive disorder, which almost drove him insane. That period of time was hard... but losing him would have killed me. This book feels like the Kings took a good look at what their long marriage has gone through. The stalker and Boo'ya Moon seem to represent difficult times  dealing with addictions and the frightening events they have dealt with regarding REAL Deep Space Cowboys. I love this book for the story itself... but after reading On Writing, I think there is a subtext to Lisey's Story of a real married couple and how they have stayed together.
B003CRM6QO|5.0|Yes, it's pure camp.  But it's pure and simple fun all the way through.  I own the DVD version which is practically unwatchable nowadays with how small the actual picture is.  The Blu-ray version is fabulous, however.  I've seen little details in the movie that I missed prior to my first viewing of this disc.  If you like the movie, you owe it to yourself to pick up the Blu-ray.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Like Temple Run 1 this is a fast paced game that requires a lot of hand and eye coordination.  There is a lot of movement.  It's challenging, exciting and fun to play.  It's also one of those addicting action play games that you can't seem to put down.
B002BWP49C|5.0|great movie a big fan. I now have I have all of the series except for breaking dawn part 2 and that will be next :)
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|This is a lot more interesting than the other hidden objects games I've played. I like it<br />Very very much.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|This was a very boring app.  Do not get it!  It takes way too long for coins to regenerate.  Plus, there is no action at all, just a wall pushing at coins.  This app is pointless.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|Disney movies are classics and are for all ages. I can watch many times and never get tired of it  :)
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|This movie is perfectly done. Remember, it's NOT the book, it's a movie - stylistically and visually compatible with it's epic predecessor (LOTR) with continuity flaws below 5%... it's as good as filmaking gets! The score, effects, and acting are stunning. It's a treat to see familiar characters (which, if you're watching chronologocally serves as their introduction) and the decision to make it a trilogy was brilliant (not a hasty cash-grab as others might accuse) because NOTHING will be left out. There will also be loads of material included from the appendices, and a few new twists and takes on this beloved classic (namely, Radagast's role) I proudly purchased the blu-ray, and the target exclusive blu-ray that came with a LEGO mini-figure of Bilbo, knowing full well there will be an extended edition one day. The menus are set-up as user friendly, the transfers of the film and all special features are crystal clear, and the sound is amazing. Think of it this way: The more copies you own, the more you have to pass down to your kids! Keep up the excellent work, Mr. Jackson!
B0053O89JM|5.0|The DVDs were in great condition and I really enjoy the show.  I have ALL eight seasons.  It is sad that they ended the show!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is marvulous. Put let me tell you about it. First you start out with nothing. Then you chop wood and make a shelter. Then you face many different monsters such as skeletins, creepers, zombies, and spiders. There are rumors of endermen, tall, black mobs that have the ability to pick up blocks and teleport.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|Super fun game, my kids love it even more than I do.  Easy to learn and fun to play, what more can you ask for?
0744014549|5.0|This is the first art book that I have purchased,and it was well worth the money. First of all, the quality of the pages, and the front/back cover, is very high and sturdy. Second, the art is just beautiful. From the environments to the characters, all is full of detail that sure left me in awe. Finally, the book is a whopping 272 pages! This seems as a huge quantity to me, in which I am more than happy to have bought this book. Overall, I am surprised at the quality and content of the book, in which it was definitely worth my money,just as the game.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|A trip back to the familiar sounds of Donald Fagen and Steely Dan but still fresh and new. A good addition to my collection.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I like the new disney animation studio movie and hope to a sequel or more like this from disney. My son and I really enjoyed this one.
B0085TKAW6|5.0|A wonderful insight into the life of people during this period. Ken really explores his characters and how they are thinking and feeling. It so good to see a male author develop some great feisty female characters. Recommend this to anyone who loves great characterisation set around a tumultuous period in our modern history.
B00A0HQ9GM|5.0|I LOVE 21 out of 23 songs, and the other 2 songs I really really like. That is so rare to have an album filled with so many amazing songs. I have had this on repeat for a few months.
B008AYA7WE|2.0|I love the Tetris style games, but I found it to be difficult to play on my kindle. The pieces didn't turn the way I wanted them to and to slide the piece all the way to the other side it sometimes drags it all the way to the bottom instead. Great concept but bad design.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great read, grabbed my attention from the first page. Done in a tasteful way and did not reveal anything of extreme value.
1616550414|5.0|The book is very detailed about every Legend of Zelda game and goes in-depth. Overall, the amount of content in the book is satisfying. Truly an item for fanatics of the series.
1609611543|5.0|This book has changed my life.  Following Dr Davis' recommendations, I have been able to lose 35 lbs in 4 months and many inches off of my waist, so that my pants are way too loose!  I feel much better and plan to follow this eating plan for the rest of my life.  I have given copies of the book to all of the physicians and nurse practitioners with whom I work, in the hopes they will pass on the knowledge to their patients.

B0015RFCZ0|5.0|I was an abused young boy in a one parent family. In order for that young boy to survive things around him that he could neither comprehend nor understand, and have any control over he created his own world. August was his music. For me it was the AAF/USAF. Always never giving up on hope, in orfer to survive as a young boy.

B00BF11STU|1.0|Without question this movie endorses the use of torture. Torture is presented as a good faith, effective method of getting intelligence. Evidently Bigelow and Boal want the viewer to ignore all the consequences of torture. Those aren't important. Viewers also need not worry about the real world contradictions. For example the fact that a trained Arabic speaking FBI interrogator was replaced with a CIA narcotics agent who didn't speak Arabic and had no interrogation background. Or that FBI agents were replaced by CIA contractors who were more interested in proving their warped theories in human behavior than getting reliable intel. Ignore the Saudi ties to 9/11 which have been covered up by the Bush and Obama administrations. Ignore the fact that CIA personnel who obstructed al Qaeda investigations before 9/11 were also leading advocates of the torture program. Ignore the fact that many CIA officials cashed in with the post 9/11 expanding growth industry of privatized intelligence. Tough on terror is the only thing that matters.<br /><br />I would guess Jessica Chastain was cast mainly because she has similar screen charisma as Julia Roberts. Even with her gruff demeanor she still comes across as the \\"all American girl.\\" This sort of quality is exactly what a Hollywood Director would want in order to make the viewer more comfortable with the use of torture.<br /><br />I read the book The Triple Agent: The al-Qaeda Mole who Infiltrated the CIA by Joby Warrick which is the non fiction account of the Khost suicide attack. In ZDT I found it strange the way Jessica (real world Jennifer Matthews) was presented so unsympathetically in regard to her cavalier disregard for base security at Camp Chapman. It made me wonder why Bigelow chose to portray her in such a manner. In my opinion the tone of ZDT seemed to mock Matthews. It would be interesting to know what Boal was told by his CIA sources about the attack. There is something very strange about the real world and ZDT versions of the Camp Chapman attack. The explanations given to the public to explain the lack of security come across as untrue. For example we were told al-Balawi wasn't searched because Matthews didn't want to offend him. If true that concern was easy to overcome. The gate guard could have searched al-Balawi and Matthews could simply have apologized (real or fake apology it doesn't matter) for offending him. Or she could have blamed the gate guard for ignoring her orders. The point is that the public explanations don't ring true. I see no reason to take the CIA's narrative at face value. For all I know there was another breach of security and CIA officials blamed Matthews for CYA purposes.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Great Detail on the horse and a Great story told . . . . . . . . . .

B000Q6ZG5M|5.0|Harry Potter Movies were in best condition. also best quality in blue ray . I wish I would have checked for whole complete set,before buying individually.<br /><br />But it was first time watching any movie in blue ray,THERE REALLY IS A BIG DIFFERENCE.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoy Nicholas Sparks' style of writing. I am able to see and feel what the characters are going through. And there was a twist at the end I wasn't expecting. I loved it! If I hadn't had to put it down to go to work and sleep for example I wouldn't have stopped until I read the whole thing in one sitting! Highly recommend. Another success Mr Sparks!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is definitely one of the greatest books I've ever read and it really opens your eyes to how individuals think. It takes a really good book to keep me interested, and The Perks of Being a Wallflower captivated my mind enough to read the whole book in two days. Excellent job Stephen Chbosky.
1616550414|5.0|Excellent value for any Zelda fan!  Definitely should buy!  Very good quality binding and great art and interesting tidbits of info.
0865479410|4.0|I didn't find this book depressing I found it realistic. . I'm sick of the \\"feel good\\" gurus who promise a happy life if you just buy all their expensive books,CDs or whatever like there is some magic formula and they are the only ones that have it or the one's who write books that say wishing will make it so.  This is a common sense way to look at happiness.<br /><br />It isn't a book that is bogged down with alot of information from every person that ever wrote anything about happiness or all the different things that could make a person happy.  The author was looking for solid answers and I was surprised that he went to a retreat to meditate which he found helpful so his mind was open.  He gets down to the meat and potatoes as to what would work to help a person manage their lives better no magic answers but a different way of working within reality.<br /><br />If you find yourself singing, \\"Don't worry be happy\\" this book is something you should read it will save you from all the energy it takes to fool yourself into thinking affirmations really work.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This is a great app, I can keep a diary, write a book, or record anything in this app. It even has a password option!
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Tommy Lee Jones is a good actor.  This was not your typical movie of  cops and bad guys. This is what made it good and worth watching.  Jone's portrayal of a law enforcement officer who won't give up no matter what , is done in typical Jone's style.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|This game is amazing. I constantly wreck the trains just because the explosions are hilarious. There are quite a few levels also.
B0094K1WZE|2.0|One expects a lot of action, but this one had so much that was unbelievable.  This to me was one of the worst Mission Impossible's. There are two positives about this movie, the locations/scenery and the ending because of its' personal touch.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|When you watch someone on youtube installing this the first thing they say is (well maybe wash the CPU, or wear a static band) is only use a little.  This tube comes with a LOT.<br /><br />Awesome
B003EVWDR0|3.0|I have heard this is an amazing movie, and I definitely want to watch it. The problem is I can't rent it, which has put me off from buying this. My children have been pestering me for a week now, but I'm not sure I can commit to buying it.
B00BKTFABE|1.0|This app is overhyped and poorly written.  It stays in portrait orientation and does not even manually change to landscape.  While the graphical interface is pretty, it is buggy, and is not particularly intuitive.  The built-in camera in the Fire HD is poor enough, but this app does nothing to help you take advantage of it.  Unless all you want to do is take \\"selfies,\\" this app is a bad choice.  Unfortunately, there aren't any other apps that work much better.
B00B19DMUE|4.0|I think this movie was fantastic. The slow build of what the demon was doing to Emily, the daughter, was excellently done.  She didn't open the box and automatically become possessed; it was a slow build as it would be if a real possession were occurring.  The way they made the special effects that were used with the girl's eyes were a fantastic touch.  So often in these films you see the person's eyes roll in the back of their head but this time each moved independently of each other and they were moving sideways rather than up/down which added an air of creepiness to it, I think that's a good term here.<br />I know some people will complain about the lack of blood & gore but personally I found the amount used in this film were perfect; after all, blood and gore doesn't make a horror movie good; it's what is left to your imagination such as when they don't show very much of what happened to Emily's teacher that makes a horror movie special.  I've seen many movies that had a ton of blood/gore and the movie was completely horrible, such as the Evil Dead movie.<br />In closing I'll say this; it isn't often that a horror movie or a movie in general leave me with the chills after it's done being watched but this film actually did.  The man who played the father, who also happened to play the dad in the Supernatural series, really knows how to work the facial expressions and emotions; the way he looked when his daughter was fighting the possession and when he first figured out it wasn't human it added something special to the movie; that really tugged at your heart strings & believe me, that isn't easily done; especially in this day & age with the movie industry.  I would highly recommend this movie.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The characters and drama just got deeper and deeper in Game of Thrones!  It does not disappoint one bit.<br /><br />The package is also very well done, and a great value for Blu-Ray, DVD, and digital copy.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST BATTERY APP I HAVE FOUND. IT GIVES YOU ALL THE STATS AND INFO YOU NEED TO GAUGE YOUR CONDITION BEFORE YOU START YOUR DAY SO YOU AREN't suprised by a power shortage.

B008B68IUY|5.0|with this order had no problem actually bought several things but this I get very good time and I recommend it
B009HEJXFS|4.0|the movie was good but the best part is being able to watch on demand without having to leave the house. when we ordered this movie; we had been laying around the house and my husband mentioned wanting to see this movie, all i had to do was one-click ordering and plug in my HDMI cord. no running to RedBox

B009439HEY|4.0|I saw Steve Hackett twice live before. Can't wait to see him live again with this album. The reason this music still sounds and feels good (despite new singers or musicians) is simple. I heard 1st piano concerto by Peter Tchaikovsky many times performed by various pianists. You can like some over others, but music is GREAT!! I feel the same with all Genesis material. It is just excellent. Compositions, songs and themes. Very advanced and innovative. Comparing to other rock bands from the same time, Genesis is clearly ahead heading the top echelon of prog rock bands. Genesis, Pink Floyd, King Krimson, Gong, Soft Machine, VDGG.. they all did it \\"progressively\\". I guess these tunes will be listened to in 50 and 100 years as well. Thank you Steve again.
B0084AYLK8|5.0|Very few of Hardy's characters ever are hard to empathise with, and it's especially hard not to do so in the case of the Mayor, who definitely, in typical Hardy fashion, has had more than his fair share of disappointments and setbacks.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really liked this story. It was very touching  and emotional. I highly recommend it, be assured it will bring tears to your eyes.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Very fun game but I get to a certain point and there's sound but screen is black and I can't do anything
B004EWFV9K|5.0|Henning Mankell is my passion this year.  I enjoyed this story most importantly, because I understood the background. I Normally must read slow to visualize Sweden from the words.  The Dementia and Alzheimer's that may be plaguing our lonely Kurt sadden me. The character is coming to an end. :(  I feel as if I know his thoughts.  The story itself revolves around the politics of the Military, maritime, and nautical settings that are also within my world. The comparison throughout  between our 2 countries was intriguing. I love reading Mankell late at night while the men are out to sea on the boats working. I have lost many hours of sleep (and energy to work, shhh...) to finish another Mankell. I am never disappointed. I will go to Sweden one day to request Mr Mankell honor me with an autographed edition. Now, on to &#34;Before The Frost&#34;......
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this game is great! my only wrongs with this game was it being very slow in the beginning, and the lack of coinage compared to temple run. other than that,the game is awesome!
B003JQLHY0|5.0|Superb value, great design. A canonical diver's style watch.<br /><br />But please understand what an Automatic watch is. It DOES NOT EVER USE A BATTERY. This is an automatic watch, not quartz.  Like EVERY watch made before 1969, this watch is completely mechanical.  It does not wind, but uses an \\"Automatic\\" winding feature built in to the movement. Do you complain that a manual transmission will not go into 2nd? Some automatics wind, the SKX... do not. Just give it a shake and it will be wound somewhat and your natural body movements will keep it wound, however it will only run for about 40 hours without motion, like almost every automatic.<br /><br />Also, like almost every analog watch with a day display, it is bilingual.<br /><br />So you will need to read the instructions.  Do not be a foolish consumer, be a wise one.
0399536108|5.0|You have to be accountable for yourself. That's the only way this book will work.<br />You have to believe that you don't have to do what others think you should be doing.<br />It is incredible.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this game. My friend has it and I've been trying to find it on the app store but I couldn't. She had it on her phone. I'm just glad I can finally play it on the kindle. Get this game!
B009KEN87O|5.0|simple fun addictive.  just an overall good game to play.  definitely worth the free, probably would have paid the money for it as well
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow! I don't have a lot of words to describe how i feel after reading this book. Even though i pretty much figured out the little twists and turns the plot took, i still couldn't stop reading.  It was heart wrenching, funny, sexy, and thought-provoking all in one.
0345529057|4.0|You cannot predict where this story will go.  The story just keeps getting deeper and deeper.  As each character unfolds the reader sways between thinking them a hero or villain and then with a twist the other side of their character is revealed.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I am hooked on Downton Abbey and was thrilled that I was able to get the DVD and see the third series without having to wait for it to come to PBS.  The show keeps you wanting more and I can't wait to see what happens next, but hate coming to the end of the DVD knowing I will have to wait another year to see what will happen to the family next.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys good soap and would like to see into the lives of our friends across the pond.
1401310400|4.0|Great read!  If you are a fan of Castle you will enjoy this book. You can picture the characters from the TV series as you read and this makes an even more enjoyable read.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Phones are not the best game controllers.  This is the kind of game phones are excellent at and Quell is one of the best.
B0027Z2T8C|5.0|If you enjoy martial arts movies and have a sense of humor I think you will love it.<br /><br />A lot of it is a spoof on action movies and/or the old kung-fu movies so you can't take it too seriously. That said the fight choreography is excellent. If you watched the old cheesy kung-fu movies on the weekends growing up you will appreciate the movie even more. Even my wife who is normally into these kinds of movies liked it. 'Nuff said.
0440237688|3.0|First rating: 3 stars (but depends) - If the book was written for the 5th to 6th grade reading level (as many have pointed out that it was for a class assignment), the book did a good job, given today's school system. I remember reading things by Audobon and Shakespeare between 3rd and 5th grade back in nineteen-forgotten. I hope it was the intent of the author to target this demographic as an audience. Otherwise, I would have found the short, simplistic sentences difficult to read and formulate an accurate picture of the scenes.<br /><br />Second rating: 1 star for technical accuracy. The book talks about things like leveling the hills and climate control but as Jonas journeys outside of the community, he never notices anything that would have been responsible. ... For example, in the end, he encounters hills and snow but no environmental barriers to keep such climate from drifting into the community. There is also very little information about how the giver has the ability to transfer memories or why he has none after giving them to Jonas yet knows enough to discuss them with Jonas on how to deal with them.<br /><br />Third rating: 2 and a half stars. I give the author the benefit of the doubt here in that it was written several years ago, however, the following items were still issues then but were not addressed in the book. First, given that the community is so 'plain' and non-emotional, the game using weapons would have been foreign and more than likely forbidden. Such 'violence' would have long been eradicated from the community. ... Similiarly, the community seems to have each family unit containing one each male and one each female parent unit along with one each male and one each female child units. ... Given the community and it's 'advances' in just about everything and how such 'parents' were chosen, there should be no reason to not have two men or two women parental units. Especially since sex doesn't seem to be necessary for procreation within the community. ... Also, since everything is supposed to comply with 'sameness' would not the idea of Lily wearing ribbons in her hair because she is a girl be counter to such sterility? ... Should not all the child units wear the same hair style since they all wear the same clothing style and shades of gray?<br /><br />Forth rating: 4 1/2 stars. This is for having the foresight to see where our current society is headed! One cannot offend anyone else or be made to publicly appologize and all the rest robotically response in acceptance! The treatment of the old, infirm, children who don't measure up (even by a couple of ounces)! Ones who question authority too much. Etc.<br /><br />I do have some questions though and will probably have more as time goes on. - Does their technology have some sort of cloaking device that would prevent people from 'elsewhere' from being curious? if all the hills were made level, what holds the river in place? Have they never wondered about where the river flows to and from?<br /><br />Finally, there are many who rated the book a single star. From reading their other comments, I would say that they did so because it points out the type of society they themselves want for us and don't like the prospect of being in a culture where any remaining individuality has been either bred or legislated out.<br /><br />The book reminded me of the movie 'Serenity' where in the end, we find that a very violent race was created by removing such traits from others. Those remaining lost so much of themselves that they lost the very will to live and just laid down to die where they stood.<br /><br />As Capt. Kirk told Spocks half brother &#34;I need my pain!&#34; ... It is indeed what gives us our humanity.

0439796644|5.0|GREAT movie, good book.  I have read the book once, and would recommend it for young readers.  I have watched the movie thrice and laughed and cried with joy each time.  I love the way the camera captured the horse's expressive glances.  I LOVE horse books and movies but have NEVER ridden one.  Go figure.  I love reading Seabiscuit and the movie was OK, but I wish that movie  had given me the connection with the horse the way War Horse did.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I had a lot of fun with this game. Some of the puzzles were pretty hard but not impossible. Worth the money for sure.

B0060MYM7O|4.0|Why sticking only 10 episodes in 5 Blu rays?? their capacity having much space, it feels unfair to have so many discs thus inflating the price. Bonuses are not better than the first season and the concept of finding stupid eggs to watch uninterresting bonus scenes that were cut should be more natural. For reference, Lost had more interresting content and hidden at the same time.<br />Anyways, I may advise people to go for the DVD version unless it's pretty much the same problem...
B0013ND30M|5.0|This was one of my favorites and my daughter loves this movie too she watched it like 40 times one right after another

B007SGM084|5.0|These books were not what I expected, learn a lot of new things Great love story, a book for both man and woman
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is great. Even better that was free. Great controls, cool retro graphics and sound. People need to make more solid games like this.
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|This is a very well made game.  The art is very well done and playful.  The gameplay is challenging and unique without being too frustrating.  Each level tests your skills in a different way, whether it's planning a route, utilizing the environment, or just flat out sprinting to the finish.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Nice retro game, enjoy it very much. A nice mix of space invaders and galaga.  Looking forward to the next game.
0345803485|2.0|I have never written a review on a book, and would hate to write a bad review since I also write. I just think of something that my nephew once said. \\"If I want to read a story, I want to read a story, not porno. If I want to read porno, I don't want to read a story.\\" Other than that she was very repetitive.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|I only got this because it was free but, I have to say that I am glad I did. I haven't been able to stop since I opened it. Totally addictive.
B008645YH6|5.0|A friend of mine introduced me to Marina and the Diamonds and I fell in love with her music! The beats are catchy and she has a lovely voice. Her songs are all hits!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|AMAZING I RECCOMEND IT FOR ANYONE!!! I HAVE IT ON MY KINDLE FIRE AND IT WORKS AWESOMELY..but i do wish that u could lik private chat ppl... but other than that its AMAZING!!
B003N5VOUO|5.0|In the movie My Name is Khan, Khan needs to tell the president \\"My name is Khan, and I am not a terrorist\\" because his wife tells him to, and, ostensibly, he takes things literal. The movie lets us know this is related to Asperger syndrome, and that Khan can't differentiate between hyperbole and real comments. He always does what he's told. He has to. Shibani Bathija, the writer, leads us to believe Khan's quest is a symptom of his disorder, much as Cervantes does in Don Quixote.<br /><br />But it's not. At one point, Mandira tells Khan to always hold her son's hand. He promises he will. But the son won't let him. So he stops. While on his quest, Khan returns to Georgia to see Mama Jenny. Mama Jenny tells him to leave. But he stays. Did he break his promise to Mandira by not holding hands, or did he obey her son?  Why didn't he obey Mama Jenny? Several people tell Khan to stop his quest; even Mandira asks him to. But he doesn't. In other words, Khan is better able to cope with conflicting orders and promises than Bathija implies. That means something else drives him.<br /><br />Bathija takes care to show Khan has more agency than we suspect. It's not Asperger syndrome that keeps him going. What keeps him going is irrational passion borne from love. It's the same passion in Romeo and Juliet, and in James Joyce's \\"The Dead.\\" Khan goes back to Mama Jenny because he loves her. He has to talk to the president because he loves his wife. Mandira blames her son's death on Khan being Muslim. His quest is to redeem himself, to her. He's not forced to see the president, or Mama Jenny. He chooses to.<br /><br />India has the largest Muslim population in the world, though only twenty per cent are Muslim, and the film plays on populist notions of Hinduism and Islam. Hindus are peaceful. Muslims are violent. Those roles are switched at the beginning, and then switched again, and then again and again, arguing a good and bad dichotomy is in everybody, and we have to choose a side. In one viewing, Americans get a bad rap, and I suspect Bathija deliberately wrote the most violent characters as white to elicit that response. Every character is American, by marriage, by naturalization, or by birth. Some choose to see that. Others don't.<br /><br />And making that choice is the driving force of the plot. At first glance, we see the world changing around Khan: as he goes on with his goal, people learn to love. But the reverse is true as well. As characters embrace each other, Khan becomes more successful. It's chicken and the egg to decide what leads to what, and, to me, it doesn't matter. The catalyst of the story is a man decides to do something. The catalyst in each character is they decide to love their neighbors.<br /><br />The heart of this movie, then, isn't simply a story of a man triumphing over odds, or just a love story. Nor is it just a critique of Muslims and America. Ultimately, this is a story about people taking control of their lives, and people deciding to change. And that's always an important story, no matter how cliche the representation might seem. Life doesn't have to be as it is. All it takes to change it is persistence.<br /><br />And the decision to do so.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|This show is amazing  and great  any one need to have this show on there colection i do recomended to anyone
0374531269|5.0|This book was a difficult book to read emotionally but I feel quite strongly that the message it carries is an important one. It should be required reading in High school so that all these young people with their technology addictions will know where  smartphones, tablets, computers, t.v.s, stereos and mp3 players get the minerals that make their gadgets work. It's hard to read about Mr. Bael's story without imagining what if it were my child... or my niece or nephew? What it it were me? Mr. Bael had an incredibly difficult life, one that I can't even begin to imagine properly, but the story of his life is so very important to the entire world around us. It's a great read. Keep a box of tissues nearby since I guarantee you it will make you cry!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Game of thrones is one of the best tv show on tv and this second season was great and amazing looking forward for the third season
B0034DGPEU|4.0|As with many books, I found that the problems and heartaches and treacheries which took many chapters to put forth, were wrapped up very quickly in the end.  I was hoping for a &#34;happy ending&#34;, but it needed a bit more &#34;meat&#34;.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|Well this show is like no other show with lawyer it diferent but it have all the stuff for a great entertaiment show to have
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A well done game and a lot of fun. If you know about horses or even if you do not, there is a lot to enjoy about this game.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Enjoyed this game. Played great on my Kindle Fire HD. Just took some time to load. Also the unlock was on sale for only 99 cents!
B00466HNHM|3.0|Movie is great, however.......<br />Without a doubt, this is the worst picture quality of any Blu-ray disc I have seen to date.<br />Actually looks below DVD quality.  Badly needs a remaster for HD.  Then I'll buy it.
0802473156|5.0|This book can bring your marriage/relationship back to life. Fall in love all over again but this time have the tools you need to understand your partners love language. I've purchased 3 so far but I keep giving them to my girlfriends who feel like they are more like roommates with their partners than wives.<br />It can save your marriage if you want it to! Everyone in a relationship should get one. Best wedding gift ever. You don't have to wait. You can start with the tools instead of searching for them later when you need them.
1932100385|5.0|This book is not an easy read, but it is a very important read, nonetheless.  Highly recommend that everyone read it and start changing their lifestyles for the better.
B009LH1Y1W|3.0|I started watching the first 7 series gratis on Netflix........couldn't believe the show has been on almost a decade. Most of the episodes are juvenile and I guess are primarily eye candy for young ladies or poofs. Amazing how this show has managed to have an 8 year run...........so far!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Referrers and what they want to do when you have a girl who gave me a friend request for my little pony them to say that cat is a girl in the USA and will continue in the first time in the USA's
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Full of action and cast with superb actors. I had a great time watching this movie. Great period piece and full of awesome action. I will buy a copy after renting it. Worth a second and maybe third look.....or more with time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wonderfully written book.  Just couldn't put it down.  Captures your interest until the very end.  Love the return to 13 years earlier throughout.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I had a great time watching this movie. Great story line but I wish Willis would get off this &#34;training my successor&#34; type of movie and go back to being the bad assed action actor that he is.
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|I gave this book 3 stars because the plot is good, but very simple. I think this is a good book for a child's bed-time story.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Even though he didn't direct this film, this is yet another Malpaso Production that is of very superior quality. Clint is sure getting up there but seems to still get around pretty good and his acting skills have improved with every movie he has done. Great actor and a superb director and most likely the greatest man in Hollywood (and has been for one hell of a long time now).
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This was a hard book to read.. At some parts I wanted to yell \\"What the hell are you doing?!\\" And others I was just smiling to myself.. but I think I threw my kindle against the wall more than once. I'm not saying this isn't a good book,  because it is.. I'm saying be prepared to want to scream or cry.. or both at the same time.. This book is amazing, please read it, but heed my warning:)
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|There is just something about Milla and the Resident Evil movie franchilse that keeps me coming back. Now, if Milla would just consider a light &#34;surgical enhancement&#34;, life would indeed be perfect!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This game after a few days of release has been pretty good so far... hut there are some cons.... first off you have to purchase glu credits to continue further on in the game which sometimes kinda sucks and the fact that in huge waves it keeps freezing up on you and it takes forever for the game to respond.... but there are a lot of great things that are in the game that will continue to grow and hopefully this game will achieve in the future...
B00BHMETKC|3.0|This is an enjoyable movie, no doubt but there were SEVERAL movies last year that were far superior to this movie. Affleck is Hollywoods &#34;Golden Boy&#34; now though so I guess they felt they had to throw him the Oscar bone. The movies content sure didn't warrant it. Worth a rental not a purchase.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|The story line was really good.  The movie COULD have been done without the horrible language in it.  In our present day, the children who could have gotten a lesson on alcoholism/drugs from this movie don't need to use the foul language accompanied with the story line.  Denzil Washington is one of my favorites.
B0055OK2T0|2.0|For whatever reason I just didn't like this movie. I guess I just miss Jason Bourne, the only character Damon played that I ever cared for. I guess it is a fairly decent &#34;chick flick&#34;.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Just started playing this game and have really enjoyed it so far. Although I think it will become addictive its a lot of fun to play! :)
B00AEFVRB2|3.0|This is a fairly decent drama with excellent acting by everyone but is far from McConaughey's best. I am glad I just rented it and didn't spend money on a keeper DVD or Blue Ray. The story line is disjointed and the ending completely unsatisfying. It is a movie FULL of very talented actors though.
B00BPLDCVM|1.0|I agree with all the negative reviews of this album. Who ever approved this so called soundtrack should be fed to a herd of Zombies. The awful remix of the main theme just butchers Bear McCreary's incredible masterpiece which sets the mood of horror and what is coming to grip us. If my cat ran across a keyboard and howled, it would sound better. Producers, give us a true sound track album which includes the music written for this one of a kind and original tv series.Amazon, how did you get the real title that you want us to pay $.99 for a download. Can you get the rest?
B005LAIIPS|5.0|It is not as good as the first Bourne movie but is at least as good as the second and third Matt Damon version. Jeremy Renner is twice the actor that the self promoting Matt Damon is so that is another plus. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story; great writing; was a wonderful read for three different generation's of my family.  Would recommend for any age over 12
B004LWZWGA|5.0|In my opinion this might be the best of the three Batman movies featuring Christian Bale. Lot of action, lot of heart showing the obstacles Mr. Wayne had to overcome to save &#34;his town&#34;. Great movie that I will enjoy for many years!
B0030Y11XS|5.0|This documentary just validates my disdain for the ways in which our American &#34;System&#34; is flawed. Unfortunately, there is very little we regular people can do because we don't have the courage to unite and fight back. Because of our attitude and failure or refusal to demand that our elected representatives represent OUR interests and well-being, we're going to continue to be at their mercy. In other words, we're going to continue to GET what we'll ACCEPT!
B004HAEGP4|4.0|I have always thought Jovovich is super hot and only wonder why she has never had &#34;augmentation&#34; surgery......heck with that, she is still hot, a good action actress and her Resident Evil franchise is simply awesome!
B008ENA74E|5.0|A well written tale of the investment banking industry, what people do and how decisions are made.  Also on Goldman Sachs management style and their company values.  I found it an exciting read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|So much more action and drama.  Need to move onto the last book.  I had friends tell me they didn't like the second trilogy but I thought it was fantastic!
B00B7ERH04|2.0|It really does nice tricks but it is so slow that it doesn't works as quickly as I though. It doesn't worth your money.
030746363X|5.0|Without a doubt one of the best book I have ever read. The information is life changing, I couldn't stop reading it!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Bruno Mars have become my new musical addiction! I love his music and lyrics. Is a great artist, looking forward to his concert this summer!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a fun game best horse's  ever .I think that little one' s would love it.<br />Hope u get it
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read all 3 of E.L.James trilogy of 'Fifty Shades' and was wishing it would continue. She has quite the<br />imagination of kinky sex, but for the rest of just plain evolving 'love', she's got it together. Unlike many<br />romantic novels, there's a really good story theme right to the end.Just begs for another book with the<br />same characters but all stories have to end someplace and so she did so and did it well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love love love it its so fun you should get it.I have no trouble getting on and off of the game.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|In my opinion this is the best of the Temple Run games! The scenery changes the further you go. My 3 kids have been fighting for turns to play this game since I downloaded it. In my opinion totally worth the .99&cent;
B004GHNIRK|3.0|The good parts of this book were really good, but the bad parts were really bad!  Was it really necessary to write two chapter explaining the sewer system of France?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is super fun with no glitches and very realistic graphics. Plus ITS FREE!!! I have it on the kindle fire and hope you like this game.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Not infinite worlds, no redstone, needs a lot of updates.  I am somewhat disappointed with minecraft pocket but still very fun.
B008220C56|3.0|It was beautifully filmed but I did not care for the way the story was presented. I would have enjoyed it so much more if the story was presented straight without all of the theatrical stage sets breaking up the story throughout the film.Still I was compelled to watch it and would reccomend it worth seeing for the beautiful costumes alone.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Awesome game needs a bit more but over all awesome. I would tell all my friends about the game and rule the world.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Very interesting plot and idea. I that with so many silos the story can continue with different characters. Hugh has created a very complex and interesting future. I would be interested to find out if he believes in Quantum Jumping and alternate universes.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the book! Can't wait till my kids are old enough to read it!<br />It was a little bit of everything romance action thrill it was a great book to read
B009KEN87O|5.0|When I read the previous reviews, I knew that I had to give this game a try.  It did NOT let me down at all.  Thank you so much for bringing those long-behind years back to me.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|Great book, excellent pictures. Very easy to follow. Made it very easy to learn how to make these types of bracelets.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|Kind of boring uh and a long I didn't get the ending at all. this movie was a disappointment to me I thought it would be more exciting than it actually was.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|I bought this on the strength of the trailer - something I normally do not do. Hathaway and Jackman were definite draws, but unfortunately in the scope of the bigger picture (vs. the trailer which was focused on them), they do not pop as anticipated. I can't over estimate how much I LOVE Hugh Jackman's singing and acting, but I think the part was too much for him. He was good, but not great. As far as Hathaway, well, she's not got the talent for Broadway. Her acting is fine, but her singing is weak - especially when combined with acting. It was like she was trying to act the songs instead of just feeling them. It came across as way overdone. The radical weight loss and cutting of her own hair makes a dramatic story, but didn't help her performance. Once Hathaway (Fantine) dies, the movie picks up A LOT.<br /><br />Crowe, well, I don't even know why he was cast in a musical. He sings like he talks. His two solos were his strongest.<br /><br />The standouts, in my opinion, were Bonham-Carter and Baron Cohen. \\"Master of the House\\" is always a show stopper, but this was magnificent. I had to see it twice. There are obvious differences to the stage show, which is expected, but the differences are what make it work. Redmayne (Marius) gave a surprisingly good performance as well! Who knew the guy could sing? He was excellent! He's definitely moving up in the world. Barks (Eponine) and the ensemble revolutionaries were EXCELLENT. The non-Hollywood stars made the whole thing vibrant and alive.<br /><br />I couldn't have imagined how the creators could pull off a film version of a theater production, but they succeed wildly.<br /><br />Maybe I am sentimental and emotional, but the story is FABULOUS. The sets, costuming and make-up make the perfect impact. I am probably drawing on my emotional connection to the theater production as well. When you add it all together, it is a thoroughly enjoyable experience.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Not what I expected at all, surprised me twice in the game, and my 7yr old can play it too. WORTH PLAYING!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I normally stay away from the virtual pet games, just not my type of game.  But there was something about this game that caught my eye. First thing first.  If you have a regular size smartphone, be ready for a  disappointment. It was difficult to see on my Galaxy S2, but on my Note 2... fantastic!<br />Other than that I am hard pressed to find any fault with the game.  It runs at your pace. And takes care of your horsewhen your not there.  I just putz around and it's fun. The graphics are really amazing.  That is the greatest feature to me.  Check it out.
0439023521|5.0|One of my favorite books.  Katniss is a strong female lead who you will begin to care about a great deal.  The action is fast paced, and it has the perfect amount of romance.  Although parts are predictable, the end was unforeseen.  Much better than the movie!
1607885204|5.0|Amazing, funny and very eye opening. Loved it! I think Ozzy has been misunderstood..lol..maybe not. All in all he's gone through alot of crap in life. How this man is still alive is beyond me. Someone was definitely watching over him. As for his wives..well kudos to them for putting up with his nonsense. Especially Sharon. Now that's a strong woman..to be almost killed by your husband and drop the charges because she truly believed he wasn't a bad guy, it's just he was someone else when he was high. That's true love my friends or they both are just plain crazy! Lol...great story and a must read! My first ever Biography:) very cool!<br />PS..The narrator, Frank Skinner was awesome!
B0000714BP|5.0|I received the DVD quicker than expected and was happy to see that.  It is in great condition and I am happy with my purchase.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I read this book for the first time quite a few years ago. It still holds its charm for me.
1594487154|4.0|Wait, I'm not a \\"salesperson\\".. However, what about the two dozen emails (or more) that you've dispatched earlier in the day, each attempting to persuade the other party to go with your suggestion, or the conversation you just had with your spouse or children where you tried to do the same? Isn't that also \\"sales\\"? You may not think of it as such, but we're all in sales - at least, that's the premise of the book.<br /><br />The book covers several themes: the history and the evolution of our definition of what it takes to be a salesperson (from the world of information asymmetry, where the salesperson had an upper hand, to an opposite world, where the customer now frequently knows much more), the shifting social norms and definitions of what or who a salesperson is, and finally, how to succeed in this brave new world.<br /><br />Well written and an engaging read with plenty of hands on examples. The ideas are not new, but thought-provoking nonetheless.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I bought this for my college athlete, and he has used it many times in many conditions and it has held up well with no problems at all. It has a lot of nice features he uses on a daily basis.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I feel this game is pretty good. overall for a free app its the poo. so download it and take a big wiff!
B008YRVW0I|4.0|Very fun and addicting. Great graphics. Need to upgrade and open more levels. If you love three in a row games you will like this.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|So I started this series when I was young but never finished so I decided to start again. I really love this book especially how it's written. You get to know the characters and personalities of each person. I can't wait to read more!
B003CN4R74|5.0|Man, I'm blown away listening to this with the headphones... all I can say is that this album frakkin ROCKS!
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I love the movie Les Mis, and did did have lots of the main songs on there. But of course, there were many songs that weren't included. In my opinion, these were probably the general favorite type of songs. Great nonetheless.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Love Mumford and Son's energy.  Not one bad song on this album.  I recommend this music highly. Anyone who likes great music that is unlike any other will love this album.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|So funny! I loved it so much! The endings are always the best part ;) Perfect for a girls movie night!
6305428050|4.0|My sister and brother in law recommended this to me, and said that it is verrrry good. I have yet to view it, so didn't feel I could give it 5 stars, but based on their review I had to give it at least 4 stars!
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book came highly recommended on a Facebook book reading page so I tried it. The language is awful and I hate the ending!!!! It's like no ending at all! Just I'm done with this story it's to long. The end!
B004CLYKMC|5.0|I read this whole book in only one day. I thought it was a really interesting memoir and captivating commentary on parenting, birth order, mother-daughter relationships and the clash between \\"east versus west.\\" I disagree with critics who have mistaken this biography for a parenting guide and have taken offense. It's clear to me that this book is not meant to be instructive, merely entertaining and hopefully enlightening. I definitely found it to be both. I related to each of these characters in different moments and found myself hating them in others. I highly recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|What clean fun. My son and I have a lot of fun . It really teaches him a lot. He is five and really gets into it
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|This game is very fun!!! It really passes the time. I play it every chance I get. I really love the sounds of the little characters when they fall out of the carts!!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Not much to say here<br /><br />Everybody knows how good this movie is<br /><br />Just make sure to get the high def version
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I loved it but wish there were more episodes it seems as though they keep decreasing the number of episodes in tv series
B000002UA0|5.0|I love this cd.It is how the Floyd recorded and arrainged it to be.This being the English version not the american with the hit singles included.The Pinks were very meticulous in how the songs were arranged.One of the few albums from this time period that still sound fresh.Syd in all his glory,whimsical lyrics and tunes for the young at heart.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|I like it had song from Trinity movie.. It was good to see some modern music and music from some of the old westerns.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|Great Book! Love Dan Brown.  He really makes you think. I would recommend this to anyone who &#34;thinks outside the box&#34;.
B0072OFM28|5.0|We own all seasons of this series and plan to order them all! Outstanding series from cable TV, the last season is on right now and will be sorely missed.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|thought it would be better but guess not. very slow at moving and not a lot of action. effects not too great either
B005COO1X6|5.0|are just the best! No matter how long or short the stories, you just get involved! You won't be disappointed.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I bought all of the books he's published after watching the first season of this cable series and plan on buying the rest. Great story!
B005LAII8K|2.0|I couldn't figure it out, and every one that seen it said the same thing. I also seen it on the big screen and the manager gave me my money back as I couldn't figure the movie out.
0375507256|5.0|So I bought the book! Great story but wish I had seen the movie. The story line is complicated, but its a great book!
B008ALA6DW|4.0|Works great, but expensive.<br />Also, if you have the latest macbook air, you can't plug a thunderbolt ethernet adapter and a mini display adapter at the same time, since they use the same (and only) port.<br />If you plan on using both at the same time, consider the USB variant.
0553801473|5.0|I bought the series after seeing the movie on cable! This some of the best fiction since Dune and The Dark Tower! You'll love this series!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app! It is very fun and addicting. You can't possibly ever get bored with it! It is hard to believe that such a wonderful app is FREE!
B008SVFX96|5.0|Saw this guy on TV and loved his music! If you like rock, you'll love this CD, order without fear.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is the best non-fiction book I have ever read.  It is very readable and interesting.  It puts Lincoln's life together with other political figures of his day.  You get not only the political but the social and moral issues of each participant.
0525952926|5.0|Realistic characters, involved writing. When I dream about the stories, it's a great book! Can't wait for the next one, You won't be disappointed!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is the best and if you don't like it this game is not for you but this game is the best
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Soon to be a movie! Read the book first! I bought it on kindle as well as hardcover. It weighs a ton and I needed to take with me for a hospital stay. Didn't want the weight in the waiting room. As usual, king writes a compelling story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I so cool and lot people play it. You get to play with your friends and it<br /><br />So fun to play
B004HW7JMO|5.0|We've followed the TV series faithfully and plan on purchasing all the DVDs. The last season is on right now and it will be missed , so were buying the DVDs because the action and story are so good.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Amazing plot line and writing style.  No spoilers here... Get through the first third of the book and you will NOT believe how deeply involved and invested you are into these characters.  You will not be able to put this book down.  Start reading early in the day because you will not put it down until all is revealed and done.<br /><br />Anyone who has gone through a troubled marriage will definitely relate to this story.  The author has dissected a troubled marriage with a fine scalpel and allowed us to further examine the remaining pieces... to our disbelief.  Be prepared for an unsuspected ending.
0345529057|5.0|series of books. Great to accompany the cable series! I just wish the author would finish the last book! Outstanding literature!
B007N6NGYG|5.0|Great graphics, good animation and soundtrack, and a really fun game.<br /><br />No Open Feint, so that's good news if you don't like malware.  So far there have not been any oppurtunities for in-app purchases, which are of course very evil. I will downgrade my rating if they show up later, but for now, this is excellent.
1469984202|5.0|I saw a review of this book and thought I'd like it. I've never read this author before, but I am really enjoying the work.
B008YJFF2M|5.0|I have to hand it to the Boccoli family.  The have produced great movies with great theme songs for 50 years.
0061478784|5.0|Purchased for middle school readers, but I enjoyed it as well! Good story line, great fiction. Quick read for adults.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Just popped this in the car stereo and 'bam' it's like a new record (to me anyway) of my all time favorite musician: Jimi Hendrix!<br /><br />What a powerful, masterful guitar player.<br /><br />One thing I never hear comment on is Jimi's singing.<br /><br />This guy had an amazing singing voice as well.<br /><br />You can instantly recognize a Hendrix tune once the first word is uttered.<br /><br />Amazing how effortless Jimi makes singing and guitar playing appear.<br /><br />True genius sadly taken way too early in life.<br /><br />I am grateful we have this new release as it rocks!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|See the above. nice way to spend some  time. If you like Tetris, you'll like this one! Thanks a million amazon free apps store!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Cool game wish gems was easier to get tho.  Nice graphics to LOVE how you can play and train your own horse.
B00AJLHTU4|5.0|I would never for a second regret purchasing this wonderful, limited number vinyl. Images and Words is one of Dream Theater's greatest albums- one that everyone should own on one format or another. Now that it's on vinyl, though, I can finally hear it in the highest quality format available. Better get this while it's still available because they will sell out eventually. OR get the red/gold swirl vinyl if you're feeling adventurous (and have more money than I do). One way or another, you NEED this vinyl!
B0045XICB2|4.0|This was the third one to come out and of the three by far the best.  It was like a real movie and not a B movie.
B002ZG999U|5.0|Excellant movie and cast,love sylvester and all his buddies,lots of action ..good story line and funny quotes as usual..A classic..
B009KHDT0C|4.0|It was funny and well made....but a great cast.  It had merit as well to the original series of which I was a fan.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Again lots of action,great stars and lots of muscle,just as good as the first expendables..Sylvester is terrific.Looks great for being my age...
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I wish I had read this before I wrote my book and published it on Amazon. Would have saved me a lot of grief fixing all the conversion errors with Kindle.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Harold Fry is a reminder to us all to try and keep perspective during our journey through life. It is a long haul if we are lucky.  This book is a touching reflection of a life lived with regret for a time, but ultimately recovered through grace and courage.  Harold's strength is an inspiration to anyone  looking to make amends.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|a lot like bejeweled but with a plot line. keeps me hooked and I enjoy the challenge. great time killer
B000P0J0B0|5.0|Fantastic  kept me glued to the screen. Woody Harrelson was awesome. A must c. Especially if u are a Tarantino fan.
0062014536|3.0|Please note that while this review does not contain spoilers for Requiem it will talk about major events in Delirium & Pandemonium so please don't read any further if you're new to the series. Consider yourselves warned!<br /><br />Requiem picks up Lena's story right after the ending of Pandemonium, she is still living in the wilds and helping plan the rebellion but life is becoming more and more difficult for the rebels. The society is becoming more organised in their plans to kill the resistance and they have started to bring the war into the wilds. With soldiers killing anyone they come across in the wilds and burning down any remaining buildings they find it isn't going to be easy for Lena and her friends to survive, let alone for them to plan future attacks. At the same time we also get to follow Lena's best friend Hana's story. Hana has been cured and is living a life of luxury inside the city while she prepares to marry the new mayor. Hana's life should be perfect but she is worried that the cure hasn't been fully effective. She also has questions about her future husband and whether he is really the man she thought he was.<br /><br />I absolutely loved Delirium, I'll admit was a little upset with the direction the story took in Pandemonium but the shocking ending more than made up for that so I couldn't wait to read the final book in the trilogy. Now that I've read it I find myself left with mixed feelings about Requiem. I'm not really sure why but the first half of the book felt incredibly slow moving, it was only Lauren Oliver's beautiful writing that kept me reading. The last third of the book was fantastic though, once Lena and Hana's stories started to merge together things really took off and I was holding my breath in anticipation of what was going to happen. It isn't enough to tell you I was gripped, I just don't even have the words to describe how caught up in the story I was.<br /><br />I was so excited by Alex's return, that was something I prayed for throughout the whole of Pandemonium so I couldn't have been happier with his shock appearance. What I wanted to see most in Requiem was more of Alex, I was never a huge fan of Julian so I wanted Lena back with Alex and for the pair of them to work things out. Alex was understandably going to be upset to see that Lena had moved on while he was gone but it was obvious that her feelings for Julian were nothing like her feelings for Alex. It's funny because I think I actually missed Alex more in this book, where he was there but not really there because he was acting so cold and distant, than I did in the last book where he only appeared on a couple of pages! Lena doesn't spend much time with Alex because he pushes her away but she doesn't really spend much time with Julian either. A lot of the time Lena is just sitting around trying to decide which boy she likes most and who she should be with which I found frustrating and a bit boring if I'm honest. I'm just so over books with love triangles, especially ones where it is so obvious who the main character really wants to be with.<br /><br />I did find it interesting to have the two completely different points of view though (although I would have loved a few chapters from Alex's POV thrown in for good measure!). It allowed us to see both what was happening in the wilds and inside the city and it made it clear that neither side was completely right in their actions. I have never been a big fan of Hana because I felt she was spoilt and selfish, especially after the way she betrayed Lena, but I actually started to understand where she was coming from a little better through reading her POV. I still don't think her actions were excusable but at least she tries to make up for it and I think she has come to realise that she shouldn't have behaved in the way she did. I even found myself feeling quite sorry for her at times, as much as her life looks perfect from the outside it really wasn't as good as it seemed and she was surrounded by some very nasty characters who made it quite clear that if she didn't act in the way she was supposed to then they considered her expendable. I felt she was quite brave to investigate what was going on in spite of the risk to her life.<br /><br />Overall I have to say that Requiem wasn't my favourite book in the trilogy but it is still full of the beautiful writing that I've come to expect from Lauren Oliver and I'm glad to know how the series ended. Lauren has left things quite open which I know some fans will love because it will allow them to decide in their own minds what happens next. Personally I prefer a more complete ending, possibly because I lack the imagination to create my own in as much detail as I would like, but I do have a very clear idea about how I would tie up a couple of situations! If you're a fan of this series then you won't want to miss this one and if you buy the UK hardback it also includes a short story from Alex's POV at the end. I'm never going to complain about spending more time with Alex even if it was hard to hear about all the things he went through after he was shot and locked up in the Crypts! I'm still a huge fan of Lauren Oliver and I'm looking forward to seeing what she comes up with next.s surrounded by some very nasty characters who made it quite clear that if she didn't act in the way she was supposed to then they considered her expendable.

B00BF11STU|5.0|Whatever you believe, whatever your politics, this is a must see movie.  The story is recent, the acting is real, and the story is compelling and heart wrenching.
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|For the price, this mouse may outshine its competitors not only by its rigid build, but also by the sheer amount of features it offers. But for me (and avid Razer imperator users) it did not feel right in my hand and here's why:<br /><br />Needs work:<br /><br />1) The mouse its too big and felt like I was carrying a huge rock around my mouse map.<br /><br />2) There is a fin in the right side of the mouse, which gets in the way of my pinky and it feels like my pinky is resting on it. My pinky should be able to go around the mouse and grab it for more control.<br /><br />3) The clicking is too loud for my taste<br /><br />4) I feel like the mouse should be more ergonomic and less bulky.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />1) Nice software, easy to use.<br /><br />2) the 3 keys on he left side where your thumb should lay are well placed, although I found myself putting my thumb on the key closest to me rather than having my thumb on the rubber center.<br /><br />3) The weight options are a nice touch.<br /><br />4) nice braided cable. Something we don't see often with cheap mouses.<br /><br />5) the two middle buttons (one above and one below the scroll wheel) are a nice component. Not something every mouse out there offers.<br /><br />Overall, the mouse was okay for me, what made me return it was that it did not feel right for me. The game I play the most is APB and I need to be able to put near perfect shots on the enemy every time and what I ended up doing was getting killed most of the time. Even after using it constantly for a couple of days, trying out every possible set-up (e.g., setting different weights, changing the DPI) I still couldn't get it to work, mainly because it felt too bulky.<br /><br />If the developers of this mouse are reading this I would advise that they look into creating a mouse that is more sleek, with even better quality components and that it fits perfectly (I mean perfectly) around the hand, no sharp corners or unnecessary fluff. I dont want to bethinking about my mouse when I play I want it to feel like it is an extension of my hand.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|This book was like reading someone's dream notebook. It takes the reader on a journey full of fantasy and wonderful images. But the story itself seemed to take awhile to come together and make sense. The ending of the book was executed in a very contemporary fashion.
0553801473|4.0|George RR Martin gets 5 stars for another fantastically detailed, well written book. Book 5 tells us that has been going on with the other characters missing from book 4 during the same time frame. It then brings it together and goes a bit further.<br />  I am giving 4 stars because the paperback was supposed to be released in October, then it was March, and now it is pushed back to June. I couldn't keep waiting, so I broke down and bought this. My biggest gripe it that the Spanish version was in paperback this whole time!!! That was really upsetting. I have the first 4 in paperback and I like my series to be uniform.<br /><br />Epic series, highly recommended. **WARNING** Please read all previous books first or you will be completely lost.
B001TKKAH8|5.0|Leonard Cohen is, I think, the greatest songwriter who's ever lived. I love him, I've listened to his entire discography multiple times, and this is probably the best debut album I've ever heard. Cohen's poetry just wraps around you, and the sparse arrangements on these first few albums bring out the beauty of it even more. And Cohen is one of those voices that's just made for vinyl; the CD version of this album is great, but there's nothing like putting that slab on a turntable and hearing the warmth that no other format can do.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this calculator is easy to use. It uses full screen, so it is easy to see. Great for your basic math equations.
B003E1QCLS|5.0|I feel like a lot of people, and especially the radio industry, have forgotten about Don McLean except for American Pie (the song). That's a crying shame, because Don is a bloody brilliant songwriter. Every track on this album is great. Buy it, listen to it start to finish, repeat, then get more Don McLean albums. I've had the mp3 version of this album for ages, and finally bought it on vinyl. It's truly a work of art.

B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works much better than the original that had to be  replaced. It seems that it is a better fit .
1781391246|4.0|Many of Lovecraft's ideas were taken from this author, and this author's wording is a lot less dense. My complaint against the book is only that the cover art is printed on a slick binding, and not a dust jacket. i would have preferred a more traditional binding, but it is still well worth the money.
0385349947|5.0|There are a lot of great quotes in this book, such as: \\"To be called ruthless a man must be Joe McCarthy, a woman just has to put you on hold.\\"-- Marlo Thomas<br /><br />However, my favorite quote is not in the book, but is the quote I've used to title this review from Feminist pioneer Gloria Steinem, about the book:<br /><br />\\"Only in women is success viewed as a barrier to giving advice.\\"-- Gloria Steinem<br /><br />This is a life-changing book, if you let it be.  By writing truthfully (with the able assistance of legendary Hollywood comedy writer and journalist Nell Scovell) about her own failings and insecurities, Sheryl Sandberg tells every woman who reads this book that they are not alone if they ever pulled back from their ambitions, whatever they may be.<br /><br />But part of what makes the book is so profound at this moment in our history is the vicious criticism that is being hurled at it.  Mostly, Sheryl Sandberg is being criticized for being a successful woman, and then daring to write a book of advice so that other women might also be successful in whatever they choose to do, whether it's running a company or raising a child.<br /><br />What a spoiled bitch.<br /><br />Well, that's what she's being accused of, at any rate.  You see, according to her critics, her observations are invalid, because she's not a coal miner's daughter or some such, but instead was the daughter of a physician and a woman who fought to save Soviet Jews, for no pay.<br /><br />That's how you get to be a spoiled bitch, apparently.<br /><br />According to Sheryl Sandberg's critics, another thing spoiled bitches do is work really hard in school and get accepted to Harvard.  Because, you see, her parents could afford to send her to that prestigious school, which somehow invalidates what it took for her to qualify. Sandberg's critics apparently feel that her lack of financial need nullified  her scholastic accomplishments.<br /><br />The fact that there has been this much venom spewed at the writer of a business book (does anybody know what Jack Welch's dad did for a living or who paid his college tuition?  Does anyone care?) tells you everything you need to know about how the playing field for women in business is in no way equal.  This book is full of well-sourced research about how men and women in management are viewed differently by both men and women employees, so if you are a woman trying to get ahead in business and feel your gender causes you to be regarded differently than the men you work with, well here's what, you're not crazy after all.<br /><br />But you are also not off the hook.  That's the best part of this book, it acknowledges that things will be different for a woman in the workplace, and then gives you real, practical strategies for dealing with the attitudes of others, and most importantly, your attitudes about yourself.  Because maybe things will be different 100 years from now, but since you won't be alive, this book can honestly help you deal with your life in the here and now.<br /><br />Read this book.  Then give it to a young woman you love as she heads out into the world.  No matter what she chooses to do with her life, this book will help.
B000VBJE9Q|1.0|Great movie, too bad it stops about 20 minutes into the movie. Don't waist your money on DVD's from this company.
B009DT98RK|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect, even given the rave reviews here, but I'm simply amazed by his guitar virtuosity and even his vocals....appears to be having a blast, and really is a show I wish I had seen live....typing this as I'm watching it for the second time....if you like Frampton at all...or even not sure....get this and enjoy!
1402786360|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed with this book, It really just covers basics of making desserts and some are very hard to understand the whys and whats of the procedures.  Yes it does have a lot of material to cover in it and I have look it over a couple times, but I haven't really use any of the recipes in it as of yet.  No recommended for new beginnings.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a great read!  A friend recommended it and I thought I'd give it a try and I'm glad I did.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I was pulled in and had to continue reading to the end. It wan an alarmingly interesting trilogy. Something that was different, but in our day and time sort of feels scarily accurate for the direction we are heading as humanity.<br />The three books went together well, but the story is so sad that there is no way for a happy ending. This needs to be known at the outset. That you are reading about war and degenerated humanity. Prepare to be shocked, yet riveted to the storyline.<br />I, for one, am glad I read this series. It has given me a clearer view of how I want to address the rest of my living in this humanity.<br />Truly thought provoking read.<br />Enjoy!<br />I did.<br />Rick.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I love the game, it does kinda do a birds thing but I have yet to see hostages for the birds to save. I mean who the hell would it even be, Toucan Sam?!?! Plus the FPS feel takes the guesswork outta where my shot will land. Therefore I can concentrate on my favorite part, where to shoot a building to strategically compromise the structure and not kill innocents in the process. Four stars because I think this could be even better with a little work, maybe more intricate or elaborate strategies required. Overall, really good job guys and girls of Miniclip.com (I do not know, work or had even heard of this developer before this game so before someone even starts to say something...)
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|This book is nothing short of a masterpiece by one of the greatest authors of the 20th century.  Arthur C. Clarke is one of my favorite authors.  In this novel he creates such a vivid picture of the last days of mankind.  He creates a compelling story of bittersweet redemption of the human race.  Assisted by a more advanced race called the Overlords.  This kindle edition was perfect. It includes an alternate forward that Clarke rewrote year after the original.

0307341550|5.0|This book is great for anyone who needs to challenge themselves. The subject matter is not always comfortable, and there are several moments when you will question the mental capability of the narrator. This book has stayed with me for a while. I will read it again in a year or so. Great read - great characters.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|The game lacks an Exit button, so it just kept going and going and going... Graphics were good and I love dinosaurs, but I can't stay in the game all day. I had to delete it
B0052UYJDC|5.0|Wonderful, you should read it. I did and I found it quite lovely. Easy, contemplative, thoughtful and more useful than I thought.
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|I would recommend this movie for children and adults alike.  It shows our military as the true patriots that they are.  I flew in the restored B-17 Memphis Belle at Peachtree DeKalb Airport in Chamblee, Ga.

B00340LM8C|5.0|Loved this movie when I was a kid and loved it even more many years later. Grace Kelly was a beautiful women who was perfect for this part. If you've never seen Cary Grant this is the movie to check out 1st.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Tell me of another poor self taught guitarist who effortlessly rolled down and  through  (previously unheard of in rock) 3rds, 5ths, 7ths, and 9ths of a key to land spot on the target in perfect timing--, or who intuitively understood \\"call and response,\\" who would introduce a sensitive 16 bars in the bridge,  expand on its theme in the next 16, then, bend, pervert, and twist it into a punching augmented jazz fury before returning home to the blues?  He did all this and more in just One song: \\"Somewhere.\\" (and filled in the rhythm guitar pieces with an innovation that never played the same riff twice).<br />Clapton said: \\"I only played with the man once for about seven minutes.  But my life was changed from that moment on.\\"
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I still can't believe I missed this TV series the first time around. Keeps you on the edge and wondering if these plots could come true. Liv, Walter, Peter and the rest of the cast are magical in how they interact with each other. Wonder what this group has been doing since the show stopped? Truly a classic thriller.
B001FA0WI4|1.0|Poorly constructed characters, multiple shallow points of view, cliched descriptions, stilted dialogue, awkward plot, risible sex scenes, totally unsympathetic heroine. Absolute drivel.
B00ACBN9CI|1.0|no controls you don't know where your going needs better graphics games like this should be illegal and I wish I. oils give 0 stars

B004XN3FHA|5.0|Needed a flashlight that could light an area 300-400 feet away from the back door. It lights up the entire area as those it was the middle of the afternoon. It is heavy and tough. Haven't measured just how far of an area it can light in the manner it does our fenced in back yard but know it is substantially further.
B00AO686MY|4.0|I ordered this movie on March 15th, and it arrived today. The first thing I did was test the DVD (since there were reported problems with it) and it seems everything has been fixed. The DVD has the proper aspect ratio, so if you ordered yours on or after the 15th, no need to worry.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray Disc, the quality is great. Good audio and video. It's still edited, but that will never change.(If you want to see Jessica Rabbits crotch, get the VHS.) This is the second of the three California scandal movies to get the Blu-ray treatment; the first was Chinatown some months ago. Now if only The Two Jakes would be ported to Blu-ray... Who Framed Roger Rabbit deals with the highway scandal, for those that don't know.<br /><br />The Blu-ray Disc includes several extras, such as deleted scenes, audio commentary, three shorts, making of, and more.<br /><br />As for advertisements, the DB has them but the DVD doesn't. When I loaded the DVD for testing, it went directly to the movie (after an annoying \\"interactive\\" menu sequence). So if you hate ads, and you don't mind the lower quality, the DVD might be good for you.<br /><br />This is a great BD copy of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and better than previous DVD copies. Even the DVD that comes in this set is better than the previous ones.
B001BPJJ82|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Great story. Great imagination and some of the best cinematography I've ever seen. What sets this movie apart is the unreal locations. None of it is CGI. They are all real places that exist in this world. And they are captured perfectly.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very addictive. so fun to play and its just like taking care of a real horse of your own! I recommend people to download this game.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|Such an epic speech from one of the best movies of the 90s. This thing may be one of the best alien blockbusters ever made.<br /><br />There is not a single bad moment in this movie. Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith are choice.
B000002MG1|5.0|Best CD I've ever listened to... If you're thinking about buying this, buy it. It's definently worth the money. 5/5*
B00BG08FKK|4.0|I love the music from this movie. I felt the actors and actresses did a great job singing on this CD. I would give this CD 5 stars, except they cut song off in the middle of the verse. I wish they could have given a complete edition. However, the major songs are complete.
B0008ENIAC|5.0|This movie is Joan Crawford at her very best! The plot and the characters are very believable and the acting is superb! A great movie for anyone who loves not only a top notch movie from Hollywood's heyday but, a movie which has Joan Crawford as the star.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love this version. Fun to play and easy too. This is the version I have been searching for.  Very relaxing.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very cute game. Fun to play. . . . .  . . . . . . . . . .
B0084IG8TM|3.0|I ordered this movie and waited in anticipation the way a child waits for Christmas! I have read all three books and the first book is what really got me hooked. There are quite a few things that it changes that the 2nd and 3rd books hinge on.. (i.e. The Mockingjay pin and how Katniss got it and Prim waking up screaming..? It adds to the drama yes... But it takes away from the story line.) It seems almost like when they made the movie, no one bothered to read at least the 2nd book (Catching Fire) to see what is carried through from the first book. Also, the way the author painted Peeta to be vs how he looked in the movie was kind of a let down... I watched part of the movie before writing this review, I am going to still remain on the side of it's a loose adaptation and only stays true to some parts... If the movie somehow redeems itself, I will update my review... Basically, if you have read the entire trilogy, you will be disappointed... If you haven't... Well you won't know the difference will you? The half of the movie I have watched, all I kept thinking was &#34;This is not right&#34; or &#34;That's not how it was in the book&#34;... As for the pricing of the movie, that is AWESOME! I got it for about 13.00, any other retailer still has it for $20+.
B009KEN87O|5.0|i highly recoment this to anyone who is a fan of old pixelated games. it has an old effect but they gave it a 3d look.
B002ZCY7QY|5.0|At first I was skeptic about buying this Blu-ray because of the region coding.<br /><br />I search a long time for this title with subtitles in my native language , Dutch, and amazon was the only store to have it. I already had a good experience with the customer service of amazon, So that was also a reason for me to buy this title at amazon.<br /><br />For my fellow Dutch countrymen, I can recommend this Sale, no region coding and Dutch subs, yehh.<br /><br />And buy the way great series.
B0091REZMW|5.0|really fun game and I also love how long the game is . its also cool how the items move around and aren't always in the same spot!
B001APM46W|5.0|Spectacular from start to finish; the blend of beautiful slow songs with catchy popular tracks is a joy to listen to end to end!
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|I must agree with many other users regarding the size of this app. It is much larger than it really needs to be, especially when memory is a premium on these devices. I too found no widgets, but I don't think the description even mentioned this app having widgets. The app found my location on it's own, which is what it is advertised to do. If anyone is having a problem with that, their gps and/or wifi might not be on. I am also getting weather conditions AND forecasts. I'll have a better idea of the accuracy of this weather source over the next day or so, but right now it's looking right. I will update my review as I know more on the accuracy issue.
B005PK553C|5.0|Ah now this will hold your attention even if you think horror stories are  ridiculous  as I do but I kept watching one after the other
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Can wait to get mores horses. Love this game great for my kids love it so far! Just wish we could do more with the horses faster.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this  alarm clock app. It's easy to use and I love the way it looks! I would recommend it to anyone who uses an alarm clock on a regular basis or just every now and then.

0312360266|5.0|Was shocked when I saw the price it was more than perfect and where I have never read anything by this author very happy.
B007HC3LHS|3.0|Good but ending could have been more intense.  I liked how the story kept two connected storylines in parallel.  Good book for women who have lost friends and loners with mental health issues they hide
B000E1JOSE|5.0|best because live last concert..good interaction with the group and the audience. Has lots of other stars and he uses them.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|This game is so fun and addicting....the game is complicated and you have  to actually do some work for the game. This game is way better than any free game I've ever had.
030758836X|2.0|Ok I read many books. I am cheap. I use the library. I have waited a long time to read this book. What trash. I can't believe it.  T.he ending was so disappointing. Really. This book sucks  Don't waste your time.

B00961ZGQC|5.0|Fun! Fun! Fun! This song is just fun.  She has great tone and the song has a great beat. Enjoy!
B004HD61KE|5.0|The Devil Colony is about a story that  explores the founding of the country that specifically  push westward and of course, the Mormon connection is absolutly brillant.. you have to read the book to understand.. James Rollins will be in your collection of books!! you'll love his writings. He has you on edge at all times.. I am so addicted to his books and Devil Colony is an absolute  extrodinary read.<br />laur98@yahoo.com
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This was a great movie!  Really clever plot twists throughout, and all four principles were excellent.  Funny, surprisingly moving, and a great treat for anyone who remembers classic arcade, Nintendo, and Sega games.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|The first book was reasonably well done. The second book was less artful. This be is totally stupid. The plot is ridiculous and one sex scene after another gets totally no hum.
B00AQMQBKK|4.0|A really challenging &amp; engrossing game. Make sure to watch the instruction movies &amp; read the play guide before you jump in. The game play is strictly tense strategy similar to a card game - this isn't a shoot `em up action game, which is great for a Lovecraftian horror game. The art is fantastic. My only complaint is the magnitude luck can play in whether you win or loose (even though you used every advantage you had...stupid elder jerk). Still, that one issue hardly ruins this great game.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Absolutely love this game. Catchy music and easy concept game fun to play and yet challenging. Fun for everyone in the family. Plays as well on evo as kindle fire.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This not my kind of book its all over the place.I cant seem to even remember what it was about,<br />would not buy this author again
1423113381|5.0|It wasn't enough, Rick Riordan, to tackle the Greek and Roman Myths with such skill? You still had to go Egyptian, too? Well, at least we know the myths are in good hands with you. In all their glory, crankiness, megalomania, and super-holy lunacy, the Gods and Goddesses of Egypt are here and ready to battle... the Kane kids? The Kane Chronicles, Book One: Red Pyramid takes the unlikely heroes of Sadie and Carter Kane and makes them save the world!<br /><br />Since their mother died, Carter Kane has been on the road with his Egyptologist/archaeologist father, Julius Kane, while Sadie Kane has been in London living with her grandparents and enduring a rather normal life. Both kids see each other only twice a year, but both resent the other. Carter wants Sadie's stable life, and Sadie wants Carter's life with their dad. When the two kids go to The British Museum with Julius, they expect another day of work disguised as a family visit. What they get is nothing they could have expected.<br /><br />Instead of normal exhibit viewing, Julius tells his kids to chain the curator in his office and stay out of the room, which they don't do, of course. When they come in the room, they witness their father summoning someone or something and releasing a scary fire man from the Rosetta Stone. Their father is thrown into a giant sarcophagus and sucked into the floor. Once the police take them back to their grandparents house, Sadie and Carter find out they are being deported and have to leave with their Uncle Amos immediately- a man neither of them know anything about.<br /><br />They are whisked away to NYC and taken to their uncle's magical mansion (atop an abandoned warehouse and magically cloaked). Here they begin to learn their true lineage- that they are the descendants of two lines of magical lines from the Gods- one on their mother's side and one from their father's family. This makes them the perfect vessels for Gods, one where they could hold the Gods without losing themselves like so many have throughout history (Cleopatra). The problem? Sadie and Carter aren't too keen on sharing their bodies with Isis and Horus. Unfortunately, with Osiris stuck in their father's body and evil Set out to destroy the world, they have no choice but to work together with their Gods to save the world, and their dad. Now they must do so with an uncle they don't quite trust, Set creating a Red Pyramid that will make him all powerful, a group of murderous cranky Egyptian legends on their trail, and not much by way of friends except Bast, the cat Goddess, and a crazy baboon who likes to each things that end in \\"o\\" (Dorito, Cheeto, flamingo...).<br /><br />After reading The Lost Hero, I was worried I might have a hard time breaking away from my favorite Greek Gods for this new series, especially since I don't know as much about Egyptian Gods as I do Greek Gods. Boy, was I wrong! This is a great story told from both Sadie's and Carter's perspectives. All the characters, from the two main characters down to the ridiculous baboon who is always getting into trouble, are hilarious, flawed, and endearing. The story is exciting and enthralling, one that will certainly keep any child or adult addicted. If you have a kid who loved Percy Jackson but needs something different, this is what will keep them reading.<br /><br />The reading level is relatively simple, and luckily the Egyptian Gods names are not as tongue-twisty as the Greek Gods (Dionysus vs. Set). The book is rather long, though, and might be daunting to unsure readers. This book would be a great companion for any class learning about Egypt. It shows the Gods and myths in whole new lights that let you really know the stories while still feeling connected to the people and creatures in them. Riordan is amazing, and I hope he eventually decides to tap into the Norse Gods too- I need to buff up on my Norse Mythology now that Greek, Roman, and Egyptian are covered!elves like so many have throughout history (Cleopatra).

0316228532|3.0|I was very disappointed in the language.  The profanity is simply and completely unnecessary and does nothing to further the plot.
0395645662|5.0|There aren't many people out there who haven't read Lois Lowry's classic, The Giver, but I happened to be one of them. Then I talked to my longtime friend (since 2nd grade!) who I often share great YA titles with (and a love for cheesy RomComs) and she told me The Giver was a book that she read in middle school that stayed with her. She still thought about the book 20 years later (god we are getting old). So, I decided I had to quit being a turd and do my YA collection justice with this 1994 Newberry winner. After finishing it in one voracious sitting, I had to ask myself if I would ever learn. I avoided Percy Jackson for years- did I learn? I refused to read Harry Potter, Twilight, and so many more for no other reason than they were popular. Now The Giver. Will I ever learn?! Why do I deprive myself of great stories?<br /><br />The story begins in a utopia. No one feels pain, no one is unhappy. Any feelings of anger, jealousy or concern are to be voiced in family units every morning in order to address and release them. Children are not born and raised with their parents. Instead, a sensible couple the community puts together is allowed to ask for children and they can receive up to one boy and one girl. Only Birth Mothers are allowed to have children, but since all the community members take drugs to inhibit sexual impulses from the time they reach puberty, no one seems to object. When people get too old, they are \\"Released\\" into a better state. If twins are born, the smaller of the two will be released. Even careers are not chosen, but rather given to the people of the community by the Elders after careful consideration. When children reach their twelfth year, they are assigned a career to focus on. Although they can request a career change, it doesn't happen. Instead, people are content in the community. They contribute, they live, and they are content. Nothing more. Nothing less.<br /><br />When Jonas reaches his twelfth year and is assigned, however, it changes everything. Jonas is assigned as the new Receiver of Memory. He is to report to the Giver of Memory, an old man who was chosen as Jonas was chosen, to be given the memories of times forgotten. This includes happy memories, like snow, sledding, warm sun, and fun. It also includes bad memories like pain, breaking an arm, war, and anger. These memories begin to change Jonas, but he is forbidden to share them with others. All he wants to do is show his sister and his friends the colors of the world, the sunshine.<br /><br />When his father, a Nurturer in the nursery, brings home a baby who isn't sleeping well, Jonas takes him into his bedroom at night and shares the happy memories with him. This soothes the baby, but is strictly forbidden, of course. Jonas and the Giver begin talking about leaving the community in order to give the people back the memories of past times, good and bad. It will be traumatic for them, but The Giver will be there to guide them. When Jonas's father announces the baby is going to be \\"released\\", Jonas, who has seen what \\"releasing\\" really is, refuses to leave the baby to that fate.<br /><br />This story is one that will truly rock your world. With so many dystopias swirling around out there, it is hard to imagine one that could sweep you off your feet as easily as this one. Nevertheless, this classic bested me. It makes the reader question their wants, their desires, their hopes. It keeps the reader on their toes and examines what is really important in life. Do we need a life free of pain and suffering? Or will that lead to the loss of all this beautiful, wonderful, and sublime as well. Do we need to experience pain in order to truly know love and happiness when we have it?<br /><br />This book is a must read for anyone who hasn't read it already. Recently a coworker said she was using it in her middle school Lit class, and I was thrilled! (eerily she told me about using it in her classroom the very same day I finished reading it!) To handthis story over to students, especially in a student-driven setting, means opening the door to struggling readers who can't get enough of a story. This will be that story- it will have them questioning everything they have ever known, and then some. And isn't that why we read anyway? To question ourselves, our worlds, what we know, what we think we want to know, and so much more? Don't be afraid to give this story to your children or students- like my grade school friend, they will never forget it!this story over to students, especially in a student-driven setting, means opening the door to struggling readers who can't get enough of a story.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|The author gleefully dances through a twisting, turning plot set in our doomed future earth. In this book, anything goes, and anyone can go at any time - every character has meaning, yet can be totally disposed of because the world is that brutal. Yet for all the macabre death, there is a tender love story contained within - but no romance, sorry fans of lengthy descriptions of people's \\"chiseled hard chest.\\" There is action that he manages to make so suspenseful that I was tempted to chapter jump to follow a character, which I have never actually been tempted to do in my whole life.<br /><br />Mr. Huxley, the author, is famous, he just doesn't know it yet. This book will stand the test of time and be something read as a \\"sci-fi classic\\" 50 years from now. And Mr. Huxley, if you are reading this, please ignore other reviewers complaining about how you are too wordy. They are wrong. I guess they don't understand the whole meaning of \\"suspense.\\"<br /><br />As a professional editor, I never found anything that needed to be removed. Everything within this book served a purpose. Don't change a THING about your beautiful, unique and gripping style of writing.

0694526088|4.0|This is not a &#34;How To&#34; business book. Rather it is an expose'. It presents real-world comparisons of companies that were already good, with those that were able to make the transition from good to great. The comparisons are based on extensive research. The information presented allows for insightful inferences to be drawn from it.<br />I purchased the unabridged version and based on my experience I would recommend the abridged version. Jim Collins tends to beat you over the head with example after example and drags each out unmercifully. Don't get me wrong, I admire Jim Collins and believe wholeheartedly in his work. It's just that he and his group did a lot of research and I assume that he felt he owed it to them, and to us, to provide as much of it as possible.

B003PIUBZS|5.0|Spartacus is an action series that airs on the STARZ network.  It is a great show for the demographic I assume it is targeting (most likely male 18-34).  It tells the story of the title character Spartacus who is enslaved by the Romans and force to fight as a Gladiator in the arena.  In my opinion the story is very well written, with great dialogue.  There is lots and lots of action which is very stylized and reminds me of the movie &#34;300&#34;.  One other thing you should know is there is quite a bit of nudity, whether that makes you less or more likely to buy, it is something you should know up front.<br />Overall a great series that is definitely worth checking out.
B0086HGW42|5.0|I love Lego House, and Sunburn (which kind of reminds me of Tracy Chapman's Fast Car). Great variety on this album, so glad I bought it. Easily several favorites on it - the sound is one that is hard to get sick of ... a chronic problem with CD's even from great artists .. you get sick of their sound by track 11. Not here.<br />My husband really likes Grade 8. My 2 year-old twins like to rock out to the song as well. (Another reason this deserves 5*'s... they are so cute when they dance!)<br /> Thanks Ed.

0307341550|4.0|Gillian Flynn, you sly dog, you. The master of suspense has done it again. I started Sharp Objects yesterday and sort of forgot to ever stop reading it. Sure, it wasn't as twisty-turny as Gone Girl was. And thank goodness for that - I don't think I could have handled another one of those. But don't discount Sharp Objects by any means; this was completely creepy in its own right.<br /><br />The characters weren't my absolute favorite, but Flynn did do a tremendous job of creating a few downright sinister characters. And even though I had my suspicions of who the killer was, I was prepared for any possible outcome. The plot line kept me wanting more...and more...and more. I kid you not when I say I could not put this book down. And of course it wouldn't be a true Gillian Flynn novel without some sort of last minute twist - and oh boy, does she deliver.<br /><br />I didn't love the whole cutting aspect of Camille's character, but I suppose it did add to both the creep factor as well as the understanding of what a crappy adolescence she had in Wind Gap. Camille is a fully flawed individual, and while you hope for her to be able to pull herself together and just be a bit normal, you come to recognize that she's a far way from normal - and any pulling together she can do is 100% temporary.<br /><br />A little clich&eacute;d and a little obvious, yes. But don't tell me I didn't warn you when you get high-power vacuum sucked right into this novel from the first sentence!
B004LROUNG|5.0|In really enjoyed The Litigators as I have all of Grisham's other books. He gets you hooked especially when he goes behind the scenes in the legal world.
B00B99KJR0|3.0|I expected Call to Atlantis around the globe, but this is not as good. Items to match are dull, the sounds for matching are annoying, and some sections seem to give you tons of time, while others don't give enough. Also, the powered up axe or sledgehammer, whatever it is, really doesn't help much. The scenery is really pretty and very detailed, but you don't really get to see it long enough to drink it in. Okay for a free app, but I don't get caught up in this one for hours like I do some of the other match 3 games.<br /><br />Also, wanted to mention the matches \\"freeze\\" sometimes and just sit there spinning instead of dropping out of the grid. Seems a little flaky at times.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|A fun read, it keeps your attention in the same way as most of Baldacci's books do. In don't know if there is any great substance or meaning to come out of the book but I found myself looking forward to any opportunity to pick it up.

0525478817|5.0|I actually had a rough time with this book: not reading it, but choosing to, since this is my 100th book review (yay!), and I knew it has to be something very special. I actually read one of the John Green's Other books, Looking for Alaska, and I actually could form a resemblance between the two books. 1. There is a main character 2. He/she meets a friend 3. He/she gets a new, hopeful life 4. The friend dies 5. Massive shock period 6. Recover<br /><br />Not all the book might follow this trend, but I think it is fine if they do, since it teaches us of loss and grief, and the recovery, and friendships. And hey? Without pain, how could we enjoy?<br /><br />This book features a girl with a serious lung cancer that would have taken her life away by filling her chests with fluids, but miraculously lives, and now stays in support of an oxygen tank. She missed 3 years of her teenage life by cancer, and now gets private (?) educations. However one day, she meets a boy in a support group, who changes her life.<br /><br />It is the classic love story, romance through the times of despair, and it actually has one of those \\"aww[...]\\" moments where, as they still know that one of them could die by cancer, forms a strong bond between each other to the point of nearly inseparable.<br /><br />The book themes around the two lovers, but also around this book, \\"An imperial affliction\\" (not a real book), which features as the girl's favorite book. It talks about a girl with a cancer, who ends up dying, and in the course of her story, talks about life, death, cancer, and family.<br /><br />If you read Looking for Alaska, then you defiantly should read this: it is fun, romantic, and exciting. It might give us the perspective of cancer, and how hard it will be to be in a 24 hour battle every day with your own body.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading it, and although it might not go into the \\"aftermaths\\" as serious as  Looking for Alaska, but it is still great, and the story finishes off clean, like most of the readers will like. 5 stars!like most of the readers will like. 5 stars!
B003VANOFY|2.0|Like many others, the audio on this headset cuts out a lot.  It is usually lasts for about 3 seconds and the reconnects.  This happens about once every 5 - 10 minutes.  It is frustrating to use.  I will annoyingly drop off voice chat for a bit.  I will also stop heading a song I am mostly through.  It is terrible.  If this were not an issue, these would be a great headset.  As is, I cannot recommend this buggy headset.<br /><br />I have tried updating my logitech software and windows itself.  Also tried various locations connected to my computer to try and find a better spot for the dongle (didn't work).  Tried to have the headset powered off a different USB plug.  I thought that getting a more expensive headset would be better than getting a cheap one, but I guess they are all the same in the end.

B000E1ZBFY|5.0|Everyone should see this movie.  It seems to give an accurate description of Pope John Paul II.  His life was full of very trying times and it shows his courage, strength, compassion and also his understanding of most everything.  The actors are all no-name and seem to give that real life feeling & meaning.  The soundtrack was enjoyable Karol Wojtyla's speech after his election as Pope was a real bonus.  Highly recommend this DVD.

The musical score,  the one liners, the funny characters, the reveal of their insecurities all make for a great movie.

B00AI5AQPQ|4.0|One of the best children's books out there. Not only did my son stay absorbed throughout the book and ask for various chapters to be read more than once, but I enjoyed this as well years after reading it as a kid.<br /><br />Now this deserves 5 stars, but some parents can't get passed the harsh language found in various spots. But these areas are easily avoided and doing so will allow you to truly enjoy this classic.

Treat yourself.

1455502626|4.0|NO SPOILERS<br /><br />I've read the first four of the John Corey series, and I'm going to post this on each of them.  Apologies if you encounter it multiple times.<br /><br />I've read each of the first four Corey novels straight through in short order, so let there be no doubt -- I like them a lot. Recommend them for you millions of crime and suspense readers out there. The writing is better than average.  The characters are strong.  The plots are very good -- not Stephen Hunter or Lee Child good, but very good.  Good suspense.  Not a lot of action, but enough.<br /><br />So why not five stars?  Two reasons -- again, not reasons not to read these novels, but things that I wish were different.<br /><br />(1) John Corey is a wiseguy.  No, not a Ray Liotta wiseguy, a wisecracking wiseguy.  But DeMille suffers from the dread Robert Crais Disease exhibited in the Elvis Cole novels.  He thinks he's funny and, while he's funnier than Elvis Cole (and unlike Elvis, is not constantly telling you what a riot he is), he never, ever, stops cracking wise, and far too often it brings the narrative to a screeching, and unfunny, halt.<br /><br />(2) Related problem -- DeMille is so busy showcasing Corey's self-imagined wittiness that sometimes it takes an eternity for the narrative to get anything said.  Lots of domestic scenes with Mrs. Corey that do not move the plot at all, but are there for the two of them to engage in marital sparring.  But that is only a subset of the larger problem, which is that there is a tremendous amount of unnecessary dialogue and explanation and recap and repetition and there are too many really, really, slow spots in these novels.  Unlike the top tier of masters of the genre, these John Corey books invite skimming.<br /><br />Bottom line -- these books were in serious need of editing.<br /><br />Having said this:  Loved 'em all, and in the middle of one now.  What's good about the Corey books is real darned good, and I commend them to you.  But you'll soon learn where to start skimming, and if you self-edit you'll probably like them enough to give them an additional star.
B008N1V11U|4.0|This was my favorite app on my kindle until it randomly  said I don't have enough data to keep playing it! So it was pretty awesome untill now. I don't want to delete it because I will lose all my data on it. So if you get this game don't download any big files. But anyway this was totally a really good app.
3899554698|5.0|I spent over an hour several days in a row just enjoying all the details in the maps. It's a book that combines graphic design with personal cartography - the interaction of people and the world. Some of the pieces were commissioned for certain goals (corporate prospectus, travel guides) but all of them mix whimsy, wonder, and a slightly skewed (or narrowly focused) worldview to create the maps. It looks great on the coffee table and would be a great resource for a classroom/play room.
1400069289|4.0|it is actually a very good book to read. I start watching myself and try creating new habits.<br /><br />the book helps to read people around me more.<br /><br />Not sure how persistent i can be with my new behavior and habits, the book certainly gets me to think and read myself more.<br /><br />if you want to kill some time, reading this book should be one of things on the list.

B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Please note that I saw this on a movie channel so that I can't comment on the quality of the DVD release or its features.<br /><br />A decent Bond film although not quite up to the standard of the best of the original franchise, but then the standards of the original are so high that one must take that into account when reviewing any Bond film. Still, the plot of a brilliant but evil former super agent who has everything worked out years in advance required too much suspension of disbelief. The pacing is uneven, with the movie dragging in places, although it does pick up in the final 1/3 of the movie. On the plus side the dialog is snappy, Craig is good, but Javier Bardem is the standout as the evil former agent gone rogue. In one scene, Bardem projects a smooth Latin sensuality, appearing to come on to Craig after he is captured and bound, to which Craig responds (Bond being galant as ever), \\"What makes you think it's my first time?\\", which got a big laugh from the audience. It may not be the best Bond film but perhaps it's the kinkiest. :-)  Ralph Fiennes in a supporting role is also a plus. The action scenes were good but not great but again the standards are so high with a Bond film that good isn't good enough--it has to be great to pass muster. Reprising a few famous elements from the earlier series is also plus, such as the original Aston-Martin car. Craig does a fine job though and his Bond is a more realistic Bond who is smart, tough, and resourceful but who is also human, has his faults and even a  vulnerable side. It's still a fine movie and last but not least the sound track is excellent and really adds to the film's ambience.

B0006GANN2|5.0|A great movie classic.  Gene Hackman was superb.  Conceived as a documentary that was made into an action film, I can understand why New York cops raved about it.  Too bad it isn't shown more often on the movie channels.

1611134226|2.0|I am a long time Preston/Child fan and always look forward to their latest book.  However, the \\"Helen Trilogy\\" lacks what I most like about their stories.  The fun of former novels isn't present in this latest series and in \\"Two Graves\\" it becomes downright maudlin.  The great repartee between Pendergast and D\\"Agosta is gone.  The dry humor isn't present.  And the brilliant, enigmatic character of Pendergast is replaced by a self-pitying, confused bore.  I'm glad that this is the end of the \\"Helen Trilogy\\" and hope that Preston/Child will get back to the brilliance of their former books. Helen was never a likeable character (and I might add, dead a long time), so one wonders why they went there?  Also, this tangent of \\"personal issues\\" has subtracted from the mysterious, enigmatic and amazing detecting skills of Pendergast and made him merely unpleasant and rather stupid.  The meandering story lines are confusing and don't seem to tie in to each other, at all.  Granted I am only half way through the audiobook, but am considering not finishing it.  I'll try to stick to it a little longer to see if the story works itself out, as all of their other books have, but I have my doubts.  The Nazi thing is just so ludicrous, passe and downright creepy.<br /><br />I understand that writers who turn out so many great stories, can have a slump, now and then.  So, I expect that future novels will get back on track.  After all, these guys are great story tellers.  I'd rather wait longer for a really great story, then have them toss out less than appealing stories due to public pressure for more.  As always, Rene Aubergenois does a great job with the narration.
B00BYOEMTQ|2.0|There was almost nothing worth watching about this movie for me and my wife. We loved the Lord of the Rings movies, but the plot of the Hobbit was all over the place, the characters were shallow, the acting and dialogue were cheesy, and there was very little action for a nearly 3 hour movie. Definitely not recommended for adults.

There are theorists, sitting with pencil and paper, fueled by expresso and heated disputes with colleagues, turning over abstract ideas in their minds. There are engineers, pushing machines and electronics well beyond the limits of existing technology.  And most of all there are experimenters, bringing the machines and the ideas together to discover something new about nature.  Modern physics at the cutting edge involves projects that cost billions of dollars and takes decades to complete, requiring extraordinary devotion and a willingness to bet high stakes in search of unique rewards.  When it all comes together, the world changes.\\"<br /><br />The above extract comes from the prologue of this extraordinary book by Dr. Sean Carroll.  He is a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology and an author.<br /><br />Note that in the above extract that a \\"boson\\" is a collective term for all particles that carry a force.  For example, the photon (a particle of light) carries the electromagnetic force.  The \\"Higgs\\" in Higgs boson is after British theoretical physicist Peter Higgs (born 1929).<br /><br />This book deals with science and thus reality.  The Higgs boson helps humanity with reality by answering this question:<br /><br />Why do most particles have mass?<br /><br />Personally, I read this book to learn about the Higgs boson but found that this book is so much more. (This book treats July 4, 2012 as the day the discovery of the Higgs boson was announced.  Actually, it was tentatively announced on this day.  As of March 14, 2013 there was tentative confirmation that the specific Higgs boson that was being searched for was actually found.)<br /><br />Each chapter begins with a brief summary of what the chapter is about:<br /><br />Chapter (1): \\"In which we ask why a group of talented and dedicated people would devote their lives to the pursuit of things too small to be seen.\\"<br />(2) \\"In which we explore how the Higgs boson has really nothing to do with God but is nevertheless pretty important.\\"  (The Higgs boson has infamously been labelled \\"the God particle.\\")<br />(3) \\"In which we tear apart matter to reveal its ultimate constituents.\\"<br />----------<br /><br />(4) \\"In which we trace the colourful history of the unlikely pastime of smashing together particles at ever-higher energies.\\"<br />(5)  \\"In which we visit the Large Hadron Collider [LHC], the triumph of science and technology that has been searching for the Higgs boson.\\"  (The LHC is the nine billion dollar \\"particle smasher\\" or \\"atom smasher\\" that may have found the Higgs boson.  The LHC's home is at CERN, the laboratory in the northwest suburbs of Geneva, Switzerland and the birthplace of the World Wide Web.  A \\"hadron\\" is a particle that can be broken down into smaller particles.  For example, a proton is a hadron.)<br />----------<br /><br />(6) \\"In which we learn how to discover new particles by colliding other particles at enormous speeds, and watching what happens.\\"<br />(7)  \\"In which we suggest that everything in the universe is made out of fields: force fields that push and pull, and matter fields whose vibrations are particles.\\"<br />(8) \\"In which we scrutinize the Higgs boson and the field from which it springs, showing how it breaks symmetries and gives the universe character.\\"<br />(9) \\"In which we figure out how to find the Higgs boson, and how we know we've found it.\\"<br />----------<br /><br />(10) \\"In which we draw back the curtain on the process by which results are obtained and discoveries are communicated.\\"<br />----------<br /><br />(11) \\"In which we relate the fascinating tale of how the \\"Higgs\\" mechanism was invented and think about how history<br />will remember it.\\"<br />(12) \\"In which we consider what lies beyond the Higgs boson: worlds of new forces, symmetries, and dimensions?\\"<br />----------<br /><br />(13) \\"In which we ask ourselves why particle physics is worth pursuing, and wonder what comes next.\\"<br /><br />Notice that I divided the above chapters into six sections.  The first section (composed of chapters 1, 2, 3) is an introductory section that details some elementary particle physics, gives explanations, etc.  The next section (chapters 4, 5) explains particle or atom smashers in general and the LHC in particular.  Section three (chapters 6,7,8,9) is more particle physics with explanation of the Higgs boson.  The fourth and sixth sections are composed of one chapter each.  Section five (chapters 11, 12) is an interesting section where the Higgs boson's past is explained with predictions of what the future of particle physics may bring.<br /><br />For those readers who want to learn about particle physics and the Higgs boson, I would first read sections one and section three.  After that, the other sections can be read in any order.<br /><br />Throughout the book are peppered black and white illustrations that illustrate important concepts.  Also included are two sets of colour photographs.<br /><br />Finally. for those who think they may get lost in a \\"particle soup,\\" there is an appendix that provides a brief \\"summary of the particles and their properties.\\"  Two other interesting appendices are also provided.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book provides the exciting story of how the human desire for understanding led to the possible greatest scientific achievement of our time!!  It is truly a glorious time to be a thinking person and to be able to appreciate this momentous achievement!!!<br /><br />(first published 2012;  prologue;  13 chapters;  main narrative 280 pages;  3 appendices;  further reading;  references;  acknowledgements;  index)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen PLETKO, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXXorces, symmetries, and dimensions?\\"<br />----------<br /><br />(13) \\"In which we ask ourselves why particle physics is worth pursuing, and wonder what comes next.\\"<br /><br />Notice that I divided the above chapters into six sections.

B00AU15HPC|3.0|This CD has some high point and some low points.  The re mixes of I know you're out there somewhere sound like they were having fun in the studio, but I find myself turning off the CD when it gets to those songs. I don't like that there are 2 songs that are repeated. I love It's cold outside of your heart but the song gets cut off before it's over( don't know why ). Love to hear Justin and his guitar on Eastern Sun. Justin's voice just doesn't sound as strong as it used to, but I still like listening to him. Still, the CD is a must have for Justin fans.

B0083SBMBM|1.0|What can i say? The title to my review says it all. This movie is utter crap. Humanity must have seriously degraded if the avengers is considered \\"the best of the best\\" in cinema. The movie has THE GAYEST main villain of all time, i swear i wouldn't be surprised if the actor for loki came out and said he was gay. This movie is extremely cheesy and has jokes that would appeal to 5 year olds. I'm 19 for God's sake, i want mature material when it comes to awesome action movies, not kid-friendly nonsense; this is why i found nolan's batman trilogy so interesting, because it wasn't just dark, it was serious and i could actually take it seriously where as the avengers almost had me laughing at the end with the unbelievably corny lines; seriously, i almost fell out of my chair in laughter when loki said \\"I'll take that drink now\\" the whole movie's plot was utterly predictable. It went like this; bam bam bam boom cheesy dialogue, cheesy dialogue, bam bam boom boom, cheesy dialogue, cheesy dialogue, the end. The movie is retarded, why people absolutely worship this movie is something i will never understand. The script is so corny and stupid that the good actors, Robert Downey Jr., and Samuel Jackson, did their best to make their performances good, but it came off as corny. This is without a doubt the most overrated bad movie of all time, not even batman and robin was this bad at least that movie was funny with Arnold's witty one-liners whereas the jokes in this movie wouldn't make my ten year old friends laugh. Disney seriously needs to stop making live action films and needs to stick with classic 2D cartoons, like Lion King 3, Treasure Planet 2, and Princess And The Frog 2.

0385737955|3.0|The Maze Runner is like black ice -- very slick and fast, but not very deep. Dashner's narrative moves like a rocket; the short chapters click past in a blur. If you think of it as Lord of the Flies meets Escape from Colditz with the Nazis replaced by giant mechanical killer maggots, you'll be in the right neighborhood.<br /><br />Dashner's world -- the Glade and the surrounding Maze -- is easy to visualize and follows its own (rather twisted) logic, an accomplishment alternative-world stories don't always manage. Like Thomas, the POV character, you're expected to suspend disbelief in a major way through the first few chapters, but after that everything follows the foundation laid down at the beginning.<br /><br />Young male readers will likely enjoy bashing through an entire YA novel that doesn't involve a romance or revolve around the hero trying to get the girl. The Glade is an entirely male world: fifty teenaged boys and one girl who comes late to the party (and doesn't get a great deal to do). Thomas aside, about half a dozen of the boys become actual characters while the rest serve as red shirts to be killed in suitably ghastly ways. None of the major characters travel through much of an arc. The story, much like the Maze itself, exists to pose problems for the characters rather than to make them grow. It does this in a highly efficient manner at breakneck speed, leaving you hanging at the end of every chapter, and it's entertaining to watch the characters try to figure it out. The dialog is generally credible for the milieu and characters, if rather more PG than the R you'd expect from the circumstances. You may even become attached to a couple of the boys.<br /><br />As with a lot of thrillers, though, once you stop to think about what's going on, you'll start to see the holes in the plot. Fifty teenaged boys trapped in a killer world for up to two years, and then a beautiful girl suddenly shows up...what could possibly go wrong? In this world, nothing; apparently no one has a sex drive. And why aren't there any girls in the Glade? Once you find out how and why the boys got there, you're likely to be offended by the gender bias if you have two X chromosomes. Anyone who's seen a teenaged boy's bedroom will marvel at the general orderliness and smooth functioning of this micro-society. And why does it take over half the story for this group of supposedly highly intelligent people to make the realization you'll come to by about chapter five?<br /><br />The Maze Runner is fast, kicky fun. It's not The Hunger Games with a male Katniss; it's more like the kind of film Ahnuld would've made if he'd been a teenaged action star. If that's what rings your bells, then dive right in.

B002GHIPYI|2.0|I bought these headphones about 4 months ago and spent A LOT of time with them both for gaming and music. I wouldn't consider myself an audiophile, but I do appreciate good quality sound for what I'm doing. My setup is pretty simple - just my gaming PC with a Creative X-Fi Titanium sound card. All music I used for testing was in FLAC format.<br /><br />First off, my biggest complaint about these headphones is how uncomfortable they are. Even after bending them so they don't clamp as hard and buying aftermarket ear cups for them (another $16.00), I still found them to hurt my ears after wearing them for a while.<br /><br />Sound wise - yes, the highs are exaggerated. These cans are a poor choice for those who like to listen to rock or any type of metal music because of those piercing highs. For gaming, it's not as bad, but the sound stage on these is pretty poor to begin with - enough so that I wouldn't even recommend them for budget gaming headphones. I couldn't believe how lackluster the sound stage was compared to my Audio Technica AD700's. Although the AD700's are more than double the price new, the HD681's stop making sense when you factor in the cost of new pads and that you can find AD700's for used on eBay for around $60-$70. Not to mention the AD700's are some of the most comfortable cans I've ever owned.<br /><br />What's funny is that I also compared these to Audio Technica ATH-M10's, which turned out to be much more comfortable, sound better for music (after doing some heavy EQing), and actually cost less too! The HD681's wouldn't bother me that much if it wasn't for how uncomfortable they are, but that's really the defining factor in my decision to deter people away from these. The only positive I will give is that they don't feel cheap (unlike the ATH-M10's), but it's not enough to redeem them.
B001GKJ2F2|5.0|Great action, enthralling story line and superb acting. I love this movie and I wanted to have it for my Angelina Jolie collection. A definite must-watch for any Angie fans out there!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Always real lyrics coupled with that raspy, throaty voice with amazing tempo & beat show the true talent of this band.<br /><br />Happy they come on the radio now, to give a break from the routine pop music!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Love this little app. Never had problems with it and it's great for shopping on the go. I use it a lot
B003Y2XI8W|4.0|Smooth & elegant sound that mellows your mind. This band works with creating a melody that literally calms you down. Well, it does for me.
B000EYK4KI|5.0|One of my favorite Angelina Jolie movies, to date. I adore her and Brad Pitt in this. Their interactions on-screen show why the work so well as a couple off-screen. Good humor, action and lots of sexy romance! Such a great, epic movie!
034580404X|1.0|Sadly I did not read the reviews of this trilogy and I purchased the whole thing. I had to force myself to finish the series, at times wanting to put my head through the wall. This is the worst writing I have ever encountered, pure garbage, trash, the list goes on. I do not understand how this got published, I do not understand why it is so popular. This author actually managed to make sex scenes boring. Really boring, like I had to keep skipping them. Holy crap.<br />I do not even know what the characters look like because the writer is unable to describe people, \\"he's so young, he is tall, he is so hot\\" Yup, that's about it. And forget about character development, the most developed character is the butt plug.<br />The characters themselves are rather hateful, I hate Ana and I hate Christian. He is always getting mad, or horny, and she is always just stupid. An English major, seriously? She sounds like a bitchy, empty headed 15 year old, not someone who reads Thomas Hardy.<br />Their conversations made me want to scream, they were pointless, drivel, completely inane. Their exchanges did not add any value to the book, especially with her friends, Their conversations mostly consisted of, how are you, I have missed you, good to see you. And with Christian, they were either horny or mad at each other.<br />In my teens I read V.C. Andrews and I thought that was bad writing, now I will have to read some Jane Austen, or Wallace Stegner to get this insanity out of my mind. If you are someone who appreciates good writing do not purchase this book, or the series.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Did not know God is plural in Hebrew. Interestingly enough, in the Quran , God  refers to himself as &#34;we&#34;.
B008J1QFLU|5.0|Only possible comment is.....WOW!! Even if nothing else the Blu-ray Disc is worth the price on it's own.Grab it while it lasts.
B0090SI460|5.0|awesome
B008ZDC7M8|4.0|I am only ticking one star as I have not seen the movie yet but want to comment on the \\"accent\\" problem mentioned by so many.<br />So many American movies these days should have subtitles as the actors mumble quietly away in a variety of accents that makes for tiresome watching/listening to us non Americans.I absolutely love films from america but the indistinct speech makes comprehension not always easy.<br />I am sure Mr Cousins \\"accent\\" is/will be better than some mumbled regional accent from one of your many states.<br />In conclusion remember that America is not the only country that appreciates film.I impatiently await my purchase .<br />I have changed the one star grading that so annoyed some sticklers.
