B004VMUS9G|5.0|WOW! I really like this helpful app! AMAZING! At first I said wow this wont work but it did! I Love it!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Reminded me of Gabriel Marquez and Gerald Durrell. Outlandish but not so far off to be totally unbelievable.<br /><br />The ending struck me at many levels because it was about how the outlandish and scary reality may be less acceptable than a safe fantasy. At the same time the ending left you wondering what was real and what was not. Always a sign of a good read.
B00BPA6XUK|5.0|Movie was pretty fun to watch. Soundtrack is cool. I would recommend this if you love to listen to instrumental music.
B0067R0APK|5.0|This is the most informative and accurate weather app out there. I trust and am extremely happy with the wonderful precise information.
B005D4YOHI|5.0|Excellent product and my second pair of this style (Newport Sandal). Fits tight compared to old pair but thinking it just needs to stretch out some as it is the same size as my originals. Because of a bad joint behind the large toe on one foot, Keen's are the only shoe that I can wear all day and do lots of walking and have no issues (I also own one other style).<br /><br />I originally bought the first pair of this style for boating, but ended up pretty much living in them for reasons described above.
B004LWZW9C|5.0|A series of really simple, but warm,  stories set in one of the most vibrant cities in the nation, if not the world. Love the New York backdrop.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|Great kids movie but it kept this adults attention too!  The story is good and the effects excellent<br />And they had some great actors
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|Nice movie<br />Clear picture<br />Good sound<br />Good clarity<br />Could not view on phone but can on iPad<br />Can if course watch on computer
B001S86J0I|5.0|I loved this movie! It reminded me so much of Star Trek and the fan culture. It is fun and anyone who has ever been to a Trek convention can so identify with the backdrop. Tim Allen is great as a washed up egomaniac who thinks everyone still loves him when actually they think he is a joke. Allen Rickman never gets out of costume and it is so great seeing him in a comedy after seeing him as Professor Snape! All in all this is a fun no-brainer, Sunday afternoon kind of movie!
B000028U0Y|5.0|Love everything Johnny Cash My Grand Father was a Johnny Cash fan also and I always will be there will never be another like him.
0545128285|4.0|This was a nice easy read. Good to add to any Potterhead's collection. I enjoyed reading Dumbledore's commentary and smiled after reading the story of the three brothers, knowing what happens in the movies regarding the Deathly Hallows. I recommend this to anyone who loves Harry Potter.
B000069HK2|5.0|My girlfriend loves &#34;The Used&#34; she listens to it all the time in the car the CD was in perfect condition
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I'm not a huge fan of Daniel Craig as Bond. This was good though because it centered around M and her interaction with Bond. Like all Bond films ther is plenty of action!
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|What do you mean Orcas/Killer whales? Any way awesome game the full version is better though. Keep making sea animals!!
B007SGM084|5.0|I'm so glad I purchased all 3 books at the same time. I read them like they were one book! Wish they hadn't ended.
074401493X|5.0|I got this because I wanted the keychain, it's heavy duty and pretty detailed<br />The strategy guide is on great hard cover and fully colored and explained (when it came I already beat the game)<br />Get it while supplies last :)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I loved season 1, felt season 2 was getting a bit ridiculous, so worried about season 3. It was definitely as good or better than season 1.
B00CTKHXFO|3.0|Well, nice cover, the artbook could be better: just some MGS covers<br />The games are the same that came with the HD collection and GOTP<br />The only extra is the downloadable voucher for Metal Gear Solid for ps1 and VR Missions, you can buy them on the PSN<br />So, just another MGS collection on my shelf
B0044DEAUA|4.0|Looks good. sound quality is also excellent. Got the product not too long so hope it works perfect as it is now.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use Pinterest all of the time. It's a great resource for any interest. It helps me be creative for kids birthday parties, recipes and more!
B000P407K4|3.0|It was interesting to see again the 1960s viewpoints and attitudes about nuclear war. Though the humor seemed corny or outdated, I really enjoyed Slim Pickens character especially when he rode an H-bomb to annihilation. George C. Scott's character showed the deep distrust of the Russians many shared at that time, and his eagerness to use the bomb highlighted this.
B00992CF6W|2.0|It's not fun it shouldn't be legal the realms don't work and just a good hint survival craft is wayyyyyy better this game stinks
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am so glad I got this one! I wanted to keep going.  Hurry with updates. I want to play more!!! Only suggestion is to add a hint button.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This is so much fun. I'm addicted. I wish there was a way I could earn more tokens to play more games. .. Maybe I just haven't found that out yet.. I wanna play it every chance I get!
B00CDSVZHY|1.0|I expected more from Quentin but this was simply disappointing..... almost went to sleep....maybe I did but could not tell the difference
B00CWY76CC|4.0|the game is tricky but also easy enough to keep playing unlike the other games where I just get stuck and stop playing the game. I love this game because I could keep playing it forever.
B003B02O0A|5.0|I sure didn't expect what I got with these book.  It was much better than i expected.  I didn't want to put it down.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I was a little upset that it didn't have Russian guns or the mp 40 but the app was realistic and lots of fun
B0063IH60K|4.0|I can play for hours very entertaining. it is easy to use and the cards and the background are pleasing to the eye.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|This is working well . It keeps freezing and doesn't let me play videos all the time. Hopefully it starts working so i can watch videos on youtube.
B00C7JFIRC|5.0|good dvd
B00821OX98|5.0|This show is the alien version of the walking dead, love this show! Can't wait for season 3 to be over and anticipate season 4!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|love this game it's SOOPS fun. The coins seem more detailed and the scenery is colorful  and there is so much gold you feel like you're in a wonder land I would so get this app so worth the money!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I have nothing to say it was just amazing it left me speechless, I am Egyptian myself and I really enjoyed it, just started it yesterday night and am on my way to buy the second book, just one thing to say fallahin actually means farmers of some sort, poor people in Arabic have another name, just because you are a fallah or a farmer does not intentionally mean you are poor. But other than that amazing and I am really speechless!
B00000I5Y6|4.0|It's an old CD, I knew the music, no surprises.  CD is good quality and it came in as described and on time.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|This series is entertaining, and we watch episodes to the end because of the new spins put on the court battles.  However, some of the episodes are too slow and seem to draw out a little.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This is a book that every mother should give her daughter to read before she enters the &#34;real&#34; workforce.  As a woman getting ready to retire, I so wish I'd had this resource while climbing the corporate ladder.  Sheryl's perspectives on gender and what it means in the workforce was dead on!  This will be one I keep in my library and refer back to periodically.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Great CD.  Love the music -- songs like this never go out of style.  Great value.  If you're not a Frankie Valli fan, don't buy it.  I like to play it in my car while driving -- makes you want to sing along.
B0063GORYU|2.0|I don't enjoy this game any more.  I did not find it entertaining.  I use the computer for my spider games.
B000QK7YQ2|2.0|It just was not that interesting to a decade-long sport-bike rider.  Enduro and dirt folks are, I believe, the targeted audience.
B0012YYZYK|5.0|Although I did not ever actually watch it, I can say with100% confidence, this is the greatest film ever made.
B00514908S|5.0|This has long been my favorite western. You would be hard pressed to find any movie with a better complete cast.
B006L4MX0Y|5.0|This was A great movie. It subtitled but it is so compelling that you don't notice. It's like The Hunger Games if it were written by Kurt Vonnegut and directed by Quentin Tarantino! Just watch it!
B000GOTESO|5.0|awesome action movie, love stallones persona, great all around movie that i would watch again and again. one of my favorites.
B0097EWK3A|3.0|I like this game but wish it had more specific instruction when one gets stuck and don't know what to do.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is so awesome. The graphics are brilliant and the gameplay is amazing. Over all I give this game 100 out of 100.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Season was great, it was a holiday gift & as advertised the set was in like new condition with barely any wear of packaging. Arrived promptly as promised & was a huge success.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|While reading this book I had sooooo many &#34;Ah Ha&#34; moments, and I am very glad I had them because I know that my career path has been changed for the better. I think that this book is perfect for all woman in business, no matter where you are in your career it will be helpful. I also think this book is great for anyone who is a manager or director and manages female team members.<br /><br />The author is direct and honest, which was a breath of fresh air. I highly recommend this book!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I really enjoyed this first episode. It was nice to have everything summed up in just a few minutes instead of spending all the time with the struggles that past winter. Plus there was plenty of excitment to stay true to walking dead.
B000BNTM96|5.0|Love the dvd and the live cd.<br /><br />Wish there were more performances from earlier tours, but this is a great show.
B000002KLG|5.0|After my husband introduced me to George Benson I totally Love George Benson's music ,Track after track of light jazz / easy listening.this is a great album if you only buy one George Benson album this would be a great addition to your collection!
B000HKYOK0|5.0|It's cheesy when compared to today's production and special effects. But I still love watching the characters and stories over and over...
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Lee Child and Jack Reacher never let you down.  Always has a different approach to Reacher accomplishing his goal.  Recommend look forward to A Wanted Man.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Saw it in order to learn the plot-line since Red 2 just came out. It was better than I expected. Great cast, descent script.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so addiction! I love minions and this game is perfect for me! Could play all night long!:)
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I only wish someone had come up with such a simple and ingenious way to calculate fractions a long time ago. Highly recommended to anyone who needs to do math with fractions.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Ammm very good play is eternamient play she horse is a fine, i am talking jajajaa sorry please i am dont talking english
0375869026|5.0|my son and i read this together and stayed up to the wee hours of the morning because we could not put it down. fantastic life lessons. we both felt inspired to be &#34;kinder than is necessary.&#34;
0061950726|5.0|like history this will not disappoint you. Back then I think people got along much better. With our high tech gizmos we fortunate is really important.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I was let down at the end, its as if the author got bored or just wanted to get it finished.  But the rest of the books was brilliant and I enjoyed it.
B002DEI4NG|1.0|One of the Disks was unreadable.  Unfortunately it was the 4th or 5th disk and by the time we got to watching that part, the warranty was expired.
B008BM9L72|5.0|I was a bit worried that this was a hyped up book with no substance, but boy was I wrong.  This is gripping stuff.  Good job I got the trilogy because I couldn't put it down.
B004HD61KE|5.0|What a read. My son put me onto this book. Seeing that proudly we have Indian blood running through our gains, anyway, the facts in this book were so great, I even remembered hearing some of them way back in my youth.<br />This book has enough adventure and intrigue to keep everyone of any age page turning.<br />A number one book!
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|Excellent movie.  The ocean scenes and the relationship with the tiger are great.  The story and the filming of flying fish and the whale is wonderful.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Works well. Need i say more? charges my samsung 10.1 tablet in a couple hours with my samsung S4 hooked up also. does get warm to the touch but not hot. charger feels of a good quality build not soft or weak. What I like about it the most is no LED. driving at night with it charging is awesome. not light disatracting me. you can look at your device when you plug it in to see if its charging. its a car charger not a home charger. plug it and leave it. your driving....
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I am hooked on The Goodwife  TV series.  The actors are great and I look forward to the next development.  Would recommend this TV series to everyone.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|He wanted a Doctor Who screwdriver. Out of the thousands on the market I chose this. And he is enjoying it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What can be said about Downton Abbey that hasn't already been said.  Excellent show, cinematography, acting, writing, and a bit of a historical perspective of the changes faced by the English Aristocracy in the face of a changing world.  Those that adapted survived, those that rigidly held to their previous way of life didn't.
B003477DVK|4.0|Also conveys a lesson for the life. Not every one is so lucky to have a dog like this one.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|I think this would be appealing to anyone at any age.  We really enjoyed this great family movie.  At one point the video game world had us craving gum drops.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|Once again, OneRepulic has put out a great album.  Not a song on this one that I skip.  Get it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Now I get it!  If the liberal press is touting a book about Jesus than there must be something wrong with it and there is!  It's written by a Muslim, who works overtime to deconstruct the biblical and historical accounts of the life and work of Jesus Christ. The author's point of view is that of traditional Islam which rejects the teachings of Jesus, his divinity, and his Messianic mission in general. The author is NOT an historian, neither is he really a religious scholar. However he is a well-educated Muslim touting Islam's traditional view of Jesus and as such it's a book about his OPINION of Jesus, and is not strictly an academic work. What's really wrong with the book is the way the press is promoting the book as historically accurate while praising the author as a \\"religious scholar\\".<br /><br />The bottom line is this: this is a well written book, (sort of) but it is historically inaccurate because the author has deliberately chosen to overlook well-known, documented facts in favour of accomplishing his mission of upholding Islam's 1,400 year old violently anti-Christian claims at the expense of truth, history, and Christianity. He disputes 99% of historical Christianity's events with the unsubstantiated claims of Islam - and one must remember that Islam set itself up to be a rival to Christianity and not the other way around. I won't even bother to go into detail about his view of \\"Jewish terrorists in ancient Palestine and so on.\\" Ha! Same old story. Same old song. This book is a sophisticated re-telling of an old lie.
B00003CXFV|1.0|The first half of the movie was okay, but about half way through the audio on the movie started to fall behind with what was happening on the screen, and became progressively worse from them on out so that by the end of the movie the audio was at least one scene behind what was happening on the screen. even though I did manage to find some humor though as most of the time by the end when you would hear a mans voice, you would be focused on a female speaker.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love Nemo's Reef. I saw a friend playing it and I started playing it, loved it so much I had to download it too. Once I start with playing it I am hooked for hours.
B002VWNICW|5.0|Well done classic. This version has a wonderful pace and gives justice to the book. Characters are believable and well acted. Attention to historic details of the settings, costumes and atmosphere is excellent.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Was a little more slowpaced, but i enjoyed the ending.  Will be looking forward to the 3rd book.  Well written.
B00A8MGIZG|4.0|when i first saw the trailer for this movie, i was hooked. i immediately went out and found the book that it's based off of and dove in. like most avid readers, i insisted on finishing the book before i saw the movie. i did. then when i watched the movie, as inevitably happens, i was disappointed with the fast-paced gloss over of the actual events and did not feel the same connection to the characters as i did in the book. THAT being said, of course the movie couldn't contain the rich subtleties of the intricate storyline constructed by the author, David Mitchell, and by my own vivid imagination. SO, with that being said, i still loved the movie and enjoyed seeing the visual interpretation of a valuable and moving story that i think is relevant to every single one of us. i DO recommend the movie, especially if you're not a reader...i think you'll enjoy it immensely, either way. just remember to pay attention, it's one of those movies. :)
B00821OX98|5.0|Great show, love the characters and love the story. I hope this show keeps going for more seasons for a while
0375507256|5.0|as some other reviewers have noted, it takes a little time at the beginning to get caught up in the story line, but once you do the fate of the characters at the end of your fingertips becomes important and urgent. the writing keeps perfect step with the different story lines, transitioning into new languages, constructs and dialects with ease in order to convey vividly the six distinctly different, yet all intertwined, stories contained therein. this book has everything: intrigue, danger, love, sacrifice, betrayal, etc. it speaks to the place inside of each and every one of us that feels a deeper connection to the people and things around us...that feeling that something much bigger than us is taking place. it juxtaposes us against the continual death and rebirth of the universe that we live in and highlights the existential and the trivial struggles that come from being cognitive, questioning beings in such a place. it effectively portrays the human struggles throughout several time periods, conveying the idea that life really is just a little bit of history repeating...but how one person, one instance can change the trajectory of our timeline. beautifully written, ambitious, and vivid: i HIGHLY recommend reading this book!
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Loved it!! Found it to be entertaining and not too unrealistic in the life of high school.  The plays are funny yet gives the viewer inside disclosure of the main character.
B000SEI230|5.0|I loved the movie even though it is a chick flick and I'm a guy.  This is the first romance novel I have ever read and I really enjoyed it.
B0046ECJBY|5.0|No one has more expertise on China and the West than Henry Kissenger.  He was integral in opening the door during his years in the Nixon Administration.<br />This book is part historical review, policy analysis, and predictor of one of the most exciting parts of the world.<br />As the first American emissary to Communist China, Kissenger has spent a life time with over 50 trips to personally take the lead for further understanding of this giant.<br />China's influence will expand and this book gives the reader a good foundation of understanding.
B000SEGTI0|4.0|The first 90% of the book was very interesting and hard to put down.  But the last part of the book was confusing and I didn't feel like I got it all.  I would still recommend it.
B004BSFC6Y|2.0|I bought these because my daughter enjoys other Lamaze brand toys. She is 4 months old and pulled the butterfly straight off the sock, then ripped his wings off.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love it. I wish we Could desighn our own horse and pick the breed though. and I also wish there were easier ways to gt gems.other than than its very time consuming In a good way.<br />and mabey quicker ways to get in compotitions too. but u can earn a horse if u get 10 medals. 7 more to go!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|great series!  Sylvia Day doesn't disappoint.  I would only suggest that readers be aware of which book was written first so we could read them in sequence.
B000YDG5W0|1.0|I bought these because I always liked and wanted a pair. I wore them occasionally on weekends. This last weekend I wore them and found after then had ripped out near the small toe. There is only a 30 day amazon warrenty. Be cautious when buying.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Really enjoyed this book, would recommend it to anyone who loves romance novels.<br />Sylvia Day is one of my best authors
098555780X|5.0|J.D. Lenzen  is the best instructor!  I had used his U tube videos for Para cord projects and then got his book and that was also great.  Have tried other books and had difficulty following the directions and pics. With J.D.'s everything from pics to written make the most difficult knots seem easy.
086571701X|5.0|I am very interested in Aquaponics and the book seems to be a very good handbook or resource book.  I hope some day to do some Aquaponic gardening and fish growing.
B008JFUP0I|4.0|This movie was action packed, full of fast cars, full of twists, and had an amazing plot. Levi`s twist I didn't see coming after fast 4. And the twist at the end with Han left me saying I can't wait for fast 7! I recommend this movie to any who like the series and would rank it as the 2nd best after fast 5.
B006MPKD54|5.0|Plot: Detective Harry Bosch of LAPD finds the events behind a number of cases start to merge with the recent suicide of a fellow police officer. In the face of departmental opposition Harry continues to investigate, even travelling south to Mexico in search of answers and in doing so crossing a notorious drug lord.<br /><br />Connelly has crafted one of his best books with this one. The narrative is poetic, the characters well-imagined and the locations authentic. He also lays done clues to the reader that come together wonderfully at the conclusion - leaving the reader beautifully sated. I was engrossed from the moment I began. Chronologically it is the second of the Bosch series and it picks up a couple of months after The Black Echo.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading it.
B0097L29KM|5.0|neil, you're great as was link wray, always straight in your way, the cool way, with great energy, truth sound,  our band Brain Glow is in the same way, we want more lp 's like that
B00B3EJ0OY|2.0|I'm guessing this would be a very good story if it were in English.  The English was printed on the screen, but it disappeared so fast we couldn't finish it and therefore we weren't able to look at the picture at all.  Therefore, we choose not to finish the movie.  It was just a waste of our time.
B00BJB2C8W|5.0|Great album. Really enjoyed this project. I am happy to support Odd Future, and Tyler, The Creator. Well worth $12.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|This was a silly, boring and poorly written work of fiction.  Harlequin use to be a name that you could trust for a well written, interesting and colorful romantic novel. Looks like those days are gone.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Perhaps the best writing in television, Aaron Sorkin and the amazing ensemble cast create the world of the center of the US Presidency. The packaging and presentation of this set is convenient, easy to use, and looks sharp on the video shelf! A great buy!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love Downton Abbey.  This is such a fun, well written show with great actors and interesting characters.  I can and do watch it over and over again. The characters are so believable.  You feel like you are right there with them.  The only thing that I did not like about the show is the death of Lady Sible.  I wish they could write her back into the show.  That would make my day.
B000B589JI|5.0|The very first fuel canister I bought has lasted me over 5 years.  I attach it to my key ring so when I need a refill I have a fill close at hand.  I love it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love it u should get this so funny too<br />I named my minion bananas what is your minions name going to be name it when u get this app
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Fringe is one of the best TV series I have ever seen. I love SciFi, but SciFi TV shows tend to be really pigeon holed. This is incredibly detailed, the character development is great, the actors are great, and the end of the series (season 5), wraps absolutely everything, back to the beginning of the series, up nicely. It's phenomenal.
0061733199|5.0|this book has tons of useful information , better have it and not need it then need it and not have it... unless you are just dumb then carry on!
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|If you love police corruption, this is it. Characters are awesome. Mackie is actually more humane than what you think when watching the first 3 episodes. I'm enjoying the second season now.
B004BCNVOA|5.0|If you are a big Pink fan, like me. I would highly recommend this download to anyone! It has so many of her hits & a great price as well. As always, no problems downloading from Amazon! I would recommend this album to all Pink fans!
0689835604|4.0|Teaches some body parts, like belly button, hands, feet, etc using cute lift the flap fun pages.  We are fans of the Karen Katz books and have many in her lift the flap series.  These are great for infants and toddlers.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|Well, it was good while I had it even though it's been less than a year since I got it.  Now I don't know where it is.  It's either lost or given away.  Would I get another?  Yes...yes I would.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This is one of my favorite series, but this season was err... Crazy!' I recommend this to supernatural lovers ( obviosly) and the tv show to anyone who likes realistic fiction, monster fighting, and cool cars ;)
B009IF8CH6|5.0|So funny and great for the whole family.  I love every character equally.  They all bring something special that the show would be missing without them.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book......I don't think I've cried or laughed harder in my life. It's, tragically beautiful. I recommend it to everyone (beware, there is well.....creative language.)
B0012TWRAO|5.0|Installed easily on my 2013 Ninja 650 as they are true handlebars and not clip-ons. My GPS is quite huge so it does block a bit of my speedometer and fuel gauge but easily remedied by angling the GPS. RAM mounts are incredibly durable and stable! Barely any screen shaking.
B00DFFHUUA|3.0|The movie was entertaining. Typical action film but there was much room for improvement. I was hoping it would have carried more over from the previous movie. Glad I waited until it was out of the movie theater.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Once you start playing Can You Escape, you will be totally hooked. It is challenging,without leaving you feeling stupid :)
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|LOVE THIS GAME ! I'VE been trying to find another game like this .:-)  :-):-)  :-)  :-)  :-):-):-)d<br />  LOVE THIS GAME ! I'VE been trying to find another game like this
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really liked this game.  The levels are pretty quick.  I really had a lot of fun playing these levels with my six year old.  The first couple of levels she could do, but needed some help after that.  If I had a suggestion for the game, it would be to add more levels.
B00821OX98|4.0|Good story.  Not overly violent.  No sex.. So appropriate for teenagers as well as adults. Cable channels could take a lesson from this show.
B004ELSDZK|5.0|This was my first time playing this time of game and I really enjoyed it.  The puzzles were challenging but not impossible.  The map was large but not too large.  Many of these types of games end up being way too short but this one was perfect.
B004GJNFHG|4.0|It was good. Brutal at times but a good foreign film especially for those who are really into movies and like foreign movies
1611761808|2.0|This was a choose read for our neighborhood book club.  Very hard to follow.  Seemed like a bunch of short stories, till you got to the end which was a little to late.  Will be putting it up for sale on EBay....did not like it.
0545265355|5.0|If you haven't read this yet you need too.... simple and easy read keeps you hooked and wanting more.... it is a mind blower! I think catching fire is my favorite its hard to decide!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I use this quite often great for an alarm clock away from home.  Makes checking the weather easier too. Thanks
034580404X|5.0|First two I read nonstop the job third one took me longer to get through but still a great trilogy... not at all what I expected either
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game.  It works pretty much like the one on a desktop. The ads can be annoying sometimes, but it is free.
B00821PCJS|4.0|My wife and I were initially not into the series based on commercials we saw, but over a day of not being sick, we watched the entire first season while veg'ing on the couch.<br /><br />The two-part opening episode is definitely awesome, and sets the stage for the rest of the season.  Give it a try!
B0095MVOMC|3.0|The game is pretty good, just not that many levels.  But I guess you can only do so much with the theme.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is very fun and hard most of the time! But I fond out it is very bad but I tried it anyway and........ LOVED IT!!!!
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Great characters and I enjoyed traveling with them.  However, I would like to know what happened to some of the characters as they sort of dissipated into thin air just when things were hitting up.
B0001I561E|5.0|this was my favorite disney movie growing up and it was worth it to get  it on dvd. My infant son and i will often watch it together
B0064MGU98|5.0|I thought this would just be another &#34;legal&#34; TV series, but it's much more than that. I love the surprises, the hooks, and the characters. I worked in at law firms for nearly 30 years so I can relate to much of what this show portrays. It's definitely worth the $$.
0439023491|4.0|Since the first book was such a satisfying read I was content with not continuing the story, but between receiving the trilogy as a gift and the second movie coming out in November I decided to read on afterall. Although I enjoyed Catching Fire, and would recommend it to anyone who has read the first installment, I found a fair amount of it to be much slower than the Hunger Games, with those parts feeling like filler to me. This is due to, at least in part, by being told the story through Katniss's eyes. If focus was given to other characters on occasion, like it was in the movie, I think the story would be a lot more balanced with deeper character development, but that's not how Suzanne Collins wrote it and I accept that.<br /><br />Understanding the writing style is one thing, but I didn't care for the focus, or lack thereof, in many areas of the book, and there were several missed opportunities at character and/or plot development. Areas I felt should've been expanded on; such as Katniss and Peeta's return to D-12 as well as the victory tour, were either presented in a flashback or vaguely summarized. Also, as other reviewers pointed out, putting Katniss and Peeta into different roles this time around; such as being mentors to their's or Gale's siblings for the Quarter Quell, or Katniss playing a larger role of the brimming rebellion rather than being the reluctant symbol, would've allowed for better characterization IMO instead of simply putting them back into the arena. I get the logic behind the Quarter Quell, and didn't mind them going back into the arena as much as many others apparently did, but it seemed like character progression was a bit stalled during the year CF took place.<br /><br />With a title like Catching Fire you'd think we would actually see the 'fire' start, by showing us instead of telling us, but that isn't really the case. Not necessarily a bad thing once you catch onto the writing style, just don't expect to leave Katniss's POV. Speaking of Katniss, she continues to act as a well-adjusted adult despite so many points contradicting that notion. Also, be aware that the main characters don't actually cause story progression; almost everything is reactionary to the plot elements, which is more realistic in this case IMO.<br /><br />It may sound like I'm being unduly critical of this book; I'd like to think I'm consistently nitpicky with most things, but I genuinely did enjoy the read as much as the previous book and hope anyone interested in this trilogy enjoys it even more. What sold me on this story was the secondary and new characters, particularly the other victors. Haymitch and Cienna really shined here and there were several new arrivals who instantly captivated me.of Katniss, she continues to act as a well-adjusted adult despite so many points contradicting that notion.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a really good game it's also very funny!!!! This game is really creative but it takes a while to load that's about the only flaw in the game
B009EBLCK8|5.0|This show is not just a whodunit mystery show.  It is a study in the relationship between Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. Great acting, great stories.
0316228583|5.0|I bought the \\"Casual Vacancy\\" when it first came out, but it took me a while to actually sit down and read it. And even then, it took me thirty pages at a time, until I hit about page three-hundred, to actually get hooked. But once I was, I couldn't put the book down - each character was developing nicely, and the plot had picked up to an interesting speed. The ending was perfect and had a semblance of happiness to it. I was so happy when all the lies and deception that surrounded the characters was pushed out in the open and they were forced to recognize it. (When I first started, there was not a single character I liked - they were all disgusting. But, taking in mind that the \\"Great Gatsby\\" is also like that, I ploughed through, and I am grateful I did.)<br /><br />It is a really good book. It's a real, gritty story about 15-or-so people and their lives. (As to note all the excessive cursing complaints, I'd like to point out that there was not a lot of cursing. The amount of \\"f bombs\\" that was actually dropped was realistic and added to each of the character's personalities. As well, all the controversial topics like rape and incest that was touched on in the book did not seem forced. Society is actually like that, but people are so private how are we to know?)<br /><br />On a last note, \\"Harry Potter\\": I've read the first two books and then never got around to finishing the series, (though I do know what happens, since I am a part of the Potter generation) and I am so glad that I read \\"Casual Vacancy\\" before reading the rest. It is hard to push away biases and expectations, and even if you say you do it's not guaranteed. I honestly held no magical expectation for Rowling, and am impressed by her writing skill and adept approach at an adult novel (which it is, so don't go looking for a happy, light read).<br /><br />It's a book that makes you think; a great window into many people's minds and motives.<br /><br />I give it five stars!
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Have you ever  started a fabulous book, engaging, well-written, and then have it disappear before you could finish reading it?  The cancellation of Firefly, an incredible series, was one of the most frustrating and cruel decisions ever made by network.  Fabulous acting, great stories, many questions unanswered - and then the rug pulled out before they were finished.<br /><br />But because the fans demanded it, eventually Whedon's miracle arrived, and a movie was made.  We could attribute this to the powers of love and belief, both explicit themes in the movie.<br /><br />A movie is not the same as a television series.  A movie needs more scope, so instead of the ragtag group of individuals trying to scavenge a living and survive without being detected, which was part of the charm of the series, we get to watch them fighting, essentially, two armies.  Devoted fans may also not need some of the exposition.<br /><br />Some little things that I love about both the series and the movie is the use of language.  The dialogue is fantastic: witty, funny, sometimes very apt.  Whedon, like Humpty-Dumpty, is a master of the words he uses, bending them to his will. There's \\"shiny\\" and \\"companion\\" and \\"nethers\\".  And perhaps, my favorite, the use of the word \\"'verse\\" to mean \\"universe\\" - but which of course also has the poetical meaning of the story.<br /><br />Not all the threads left hanging from the series are tied up, but many of them are.  We learn a lot more about River.  We resolve the relationship between Simon and Kaylee.  Mal recovers his belief system.  We have a more sensible explanation for Reavers.  We don't get the background on Inara or Shepherd Book, but at least with the latter he says he's not going to give his life story.<br /><br />The movie starts and ends with discussions of love.  We first learn the love that Simon has for his sister, recognized by, of all people, the movie's main antagonist, the nameless operative.  The nameless operative also understands the power of belief.  The operative is therefore in a better position than Mal at the movie's beginning.  However, the operative is too committed to unquestioning belief and because of this he does things that he admits make him a monster.  Mal, during the movie, also learns to believe again - but his commitment to this is based on a more thorough investigation.  There's a wonderful exchange, in which the nameless operative asks Mal if he is ready to die for his beliefs.  Mal says, \\"Yes - but that ain't exactly Plan A.\\"<br /><br />I do have some quibbles.  Jewel Staite lost the 20 lbs that she gained for her original stint as Kaylee.  Perhaps she's more beautiful without the 20 lbs, but she no longer feels like Kaylee.  And although I can imagine Kaylee and Simon getting together - they're both good people - they really don't feel like a good match.  Also, there seems to be no resolution to Jayne's story.  He finally gets to be considered a genuine hero and perhaps that should have been acknowledged.<br /><br />Nevertheless a wonderful movie and a tribute to the faith of the fans and Firefly's creators.the power of belief.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|I don't get much time to read novels.  When I do,I love to be swept away to learn about other places,cultures,and times along with a good story and characters. I don't give this 5 stars because I still love his first novel,The Kite Runner, the best.
0143121006|5.0|This is the true story of the hunt to find the killer of a Caucasian girl in pre WWII Peking.  The investigation is complicated by the informal multi jurisdictions involved and the unstable government prevailing in China at the time, as there was no central governing authority.  War intervenes so the case goes unsolved until now.

B009Z59ZNE|5.0|I remembered this series from over 20 years ago and even remembers bits of dialog.  I already bought the American version and I wanted to compare the two.  The American version sticks to all the major plot points.  It had to be updated and tailored to the US but they did a good job.  It is one of the best stories.  There is gratuitous sex in both versions that did not appear in the book.  It is just male fantasy and lends a complication that I don't think these ambitions politicians would fall for.<br /><br />some spoilers:<br /><br />I have now viewed to Play the King and The Final Cut.  The package is thrilling.  It is really contemporary and needs no update.  I love the Shakespearian quotes peppered throughout sending me to google to find from which play they were.  \\"Cry havoc and let loose the dogs of war.\\"  Julius  Caesar.  Some complain about the ending but I think it is fine.  Sociopaths are unable to love.<br /><br />I just wish PBS would broadcast it again.  It is a neat trick the far right has constructed.  By claiming that all media is liberal, it has cowed the media to take a right leaning stand.  Thus they are afraid to broadcast this series again, while the American version is just as evil but is now Democrat.  Gag me.
B004LWZW8S|4.0|This was a really good movie and I like it and my friend like it as well it was well done
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The Good Wife is one of the few TV series I have taken the time to follow.  Excellent writing and acting.  Very well directed.  I highly recommend it.  Love the &#34;Marlboro Man&#34;!
B00BN0BZVY|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me and I finally got around to reading it this summer. I read it in two sittings. The writing was very compelling, and the characters quirky. My husband also read it and enjoyed it.

B00DRPVE3M|2.0|I know you definitely need to make some profits from advertisement because the game is free.<br />However, it will make people feel mad at watching the ads whenever they push the icons.<br />The game is interesting, and combined with your friends.<br />I strongly recommend to decrease the frequency of ads.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is the best game. does freeze up a lot and all the adds. but a great game I love it you got to love it
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Extremely powerful. Amazing how a story that seems shallow and simple can reach down so deep and make one think so much. It's unusual for a book be a guide and a way of life rather than just a story that we relate to. Great book!!
B000HL2J0G|5.0|This whole series was my favorite when I was much younger.  It should be brought back for kids to watch today.  The Andy Griffith Show, Leave it to Beaver and many others would provide good quality TV for young minds to enjoy.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|It's fun when you can play it I rage quit it because  when ever I play it , it doesn't said that it could not get data for both me and my friend
B0082PMABC|5.0|Jane Austen is one of my fave authors. I bought the book to compare it to some of the movie versions and of course, the original is always better.  But just in case you're curious, the BBC version from 1996 starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is the most faithful film adaptation of this classic!

B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I loved all three seasons - I'm giving only four stars for Season 3, however, because there were too many story lines &#34;killed off&#34; and the downstairs devil dude seems to continue to be rewarded for his devious, arrogant behavior.<br />Hope the Bates' couple will become a family soon.
B000FA5STS|5.0|Very good story line. Lots of details. Lots of twists. Good characters. Kept me reading well into the night. I read for pleasure not analysis.

159463176X|5.0|I have been waiting eagerly for this novel and it was well worth the wait even though I was not entirely sure about a generational novel. They can be long and drawn out and won't always resonate with you. However, Khaled Hosseini knows how to delve into emotions that we all experience regarding choices that we make and how they resonate through the years.  I found myself at times gathering my bearings when beginning a new chapter.  It was not readily clear where the author was heading, at first,  but his excellent writing skills enabled him to tie up the chapter and where it fits into the novel. It may just be a word, a sentence, but you gradually figure it out - superb!  His writing is never predictable, and he had the ability to draw me into a story that is hauntingly beautiful and unforgettable. This one will stay with me for a long time.  Remarkable.

B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I thought I would really enjoy this game because I like other tile swapping games. However, the game was frustrating. I downloaded the free version but you are limited in your play. You are only given so many lives on the free version. When you run out of lives you either have to purchase more lives or wait a set time limit before the game gives you more lives. Since I didn't want to purchase more lives the game only lasted a few minutes. Then I had to wait for more chances to play. I finally just uninstalled the game because I was tired of waiting to play.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|This film is a great masterpiece of filmmaking! Perfect in every sense. It is Anthony Perkin's masterpiece as well....no other character in film history makes you cringe yet feel sorry for at the same time. It takes a special talent to do that and why he didn't get nominated for the Oscar much less win will never be understood!! Just as Vivien Leigh will always be Scarlett O'Hara, Judy Garland will always be Dorothy, Anthony Perkins will always be Norman Bates.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is outstanding as well...notably Janet Leigh as the doomed Marion Crane. She deserved her Oscar nomination for her performance.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|I purchased this app because my family loves to play this board game. The mobile version is even better than the board game. I like that mobile version calculates all of the scores for each player. Plus, there is no room for cheating since the game will only allow you to place pieces in correct spaces. We now play this game constantly. You can play alone or with multi-players. You can also choose to play the game with or without the river pieces.
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|It's been 20 years since a stand-alone predator movie has been made (besides the alien vs predator movies). I like how it expands on the Predator franchise by showing different worlds besides being set on Earth, although the alien jungle looks a lot like South America. The characters were great, the different kind of predators are awesome, it is overall a worthy entry in the predator franchise.
B00AAQWMB4|4.0|I purchased this game because I often played the board version with my students. This game is great to pass the time and takes all the guess work out of placing pieces or final scoring. You can choose which color you wish to play as well. The only drawback to the mobile version instead of the board version is that, while you can rotate pieces to fit on the board, you can not flip pieces over. Maybe there is a way to do this move but I haven't discovered it yet. However, it is not a deal breaker on the game. I still enjoy playing it.
B001KZVQJI|5.0|This Film is one hell of a ride. All I can say is that this movie looks phenomenal on Blu-Ray and you will be entertained.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Eben's experience was truly amazing.  To not be a religious man before and to experience what he did was a gift from God. There is no doubt in my mind that he truly did experience what he said he did.  There is so so much more to life than what we have on earth. Eben's detail was incredible and I thank him for such an eye opening read.
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|This film, is without a shadow of a doubt, one of the finest, most imaginative comedy horror films ever made. Raimi, has put all the aspects of the film together in masterful fashion. The camera work and sound effects are pulsating, and the timing is perfection. And in Bruce Campbell, the film as a lead actor who gives an exceptional performance. Campbell plays \\"Ash\\", an everyday, supermarket attendant who suddenly finds himself thrown into the unusual situation of having to defend himself against, Demons, evil spirits and even his own possessed hand, just in order to survive the night. I laughed, I gasped, and I gripped the arm of my chair throughout! If you like your comedies, black and hilarious, and your horror, gory and sensational, then look no further. Raimi has created the definitive comedy horror! And its Fantastic!<br /><br />If your a Movie Enthusiast than you must own this on Blu-ray.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|After reading the first in this series, I was eager to dive into the continuation of the story.  It is fast paced & full of history as it connects to so many wonderful characters.  So much of the ugliness of war is clearly spelled out for the reader, which can be tough to read about, but one must rally on to the end.  I enjoyed this reading experience.

I considered buying it numerous times but didn't actually do it. Finally decided to search it on Amazon. SO glad I did. I absolutely loved this book. It was perfect in every way. I loved the characters. They were amazing and fit so perfectly together. They were real and it was so easy to understand and come to love each one of them. I love the metaphors and the quotes from other authors. It was just wonderful. One of the best books I have ever read. Every person should read this book!

It’s a slim book, and it’s written in a deceptively easy to read style, but there’s a lot going on in there and every word counts. And if you get to the end and you want more, start again: the second time through you may see things that weren’t there the first time.&#34;

Amazon won't let me review it without giving it at least one star, so there you go.

B00475AYJQ|4.0|I was a little worried this second in the series couldn't possibly be as good as the first. I had nothing to be worried about. Though there are a couple spots that seemed to drag, and I found myself skimming, they were brief and only a couple. That is why I gave 4 stars, instead of 5. Overall, Rothfuss writes with splendid detail, breathing life into this amazing fantasy. I love this series so far, love the first book, love the second. I cannot wait for the third to be released.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|very good book. i enjoyed it very much. can't wait to get to book 2. give it a try, ok?
B00C3UUZVE|4.0|Out of all the Dr. Panda games my son plays this one and the handyman game the most!  He loves doing the gardening on this one and it will entertain him for about 30 uninterrupted minutes at a time which is pretty great for a 4 year old!
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|A great strategy game to keep you occupied for hours on end. Best on tablets, not recommended for smaller screens.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Love this series!  Great break from reality and to escape into a fantasy world.  Was sad to get to the end!
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|Yet another great album from Clutch. If the title track doesn't get you pumped up I don't know what will. This album holds strong from start to finish. If you haven't listened to Clutch before you'll get hooked. If you're a long time Clutch fan you won't be disappointed.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|It does have a little crude humor which is why it is PG and not G. Keep that in mind. Very Funny though. Love the minions!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Bruce Willis is great as usual. I would highly recommend this movie with a friend and a bag of popcorn!
B001CO42MU|4.0|I have always believed, with an exception here and there, that Johnny Depp was extremely overrated as an actor. His good looks, combined with his outlandish characters, often earn him more credit than he deserves. Having watched the film, Blow, for the first time this weekend, It was very easy to see that Depp does in fact have a lot of talent, and can play more than just a Disney character with too much make-up. I though Depp was good in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, but he gives, by far, his best performance to date in Blow. For those unfamiliar with this true story, Depp plays George Jung, an American who worked for the Median Cartel and was responsible for bringing in an estimated 80% of all the cocaine in The United States, during the 70s and 80s. The story starts with his suburban upbringing and follows his rise to power and finally his fall from grace. Blow was very reminiscent of the kind of film you usually see from Leonard DiCaprio, and while he would have done a nice job in the lead, even he would be hard pressed to top the performance given by Johnny Depp. In the performance of a lifetime, Depp takes you through every aspect of this mans life with ease and really gave us a rare, inside look into Pablo Escobar's operation. He's paired with the lovely Penelope Cruz, who was a disaster playing Jung's wife. Her performance was nominated for a Razzie, as the worst female performance of the year, with good reason. Throughout the film, She's hard to understand and often times screaming like a lunatic. Her character was a very important part of Jung's life and they couldn't have done a worse job of casting. They needed a good looking Latin American woman to portray the part and Cruz was the top name at the time, but her sloppy performance really takes away from an interesting film. I found Blow to be a fascinating look into the other side of the war on drugs. Often times we only hear about what the FBI is doing, but not about the trade itself. Blow is original, cutting edge, and really a terrific film that shouldn't be missed.

B00AZMFO6I|5.0|What will follow will be a sophisticated adult version of a 10-year-old squealing OMG I love this movie, with six L s and about 10 !'s<br /><br />As I write this review there are 285 four and five star reviews two hundred of them five-star, 28 one or two star reviews and 48 straddling three stars. Several of the movie haters speak of technical problems with the DVD and perhaps should not be counted. You should be aware that some folks have had technical issues. Others who speak against the movie seem to be upset that the language is not uniformly dignified. I'm not sure what to say to that. The language seemed very authentic. One soul felt that the movie was to geriatric. I'm guessing they missed all of the advertisements and did not pay attention to the picture on the cover. One negative person sniffed that this movie did not deal authentically with aging issues. This is not an issues movie; Quartet is if anything a slice of life -it is just happens that the slice of life under discussion is very close to the end-of-life.<br /><br />Director Dustin Hoffman has assembled one of those classic casts of British performers who are as at ease in supporting roles as in leading roles and know how to impart a quality depth to every performance. The philosophy on display here is that there are no small roles and small actors need not apply. While the performances and the script tends to favor classifying this is a comedy, the underlining theme is that these are people serious as death.<br /><br />Quartet takes place in a retirement home for British musicians. Overall these are plush quarters but  clearly assignments are made based on the reputation and status of the now retired artists. The story arc revolves around the long ago failed marriage between newly arriving Opera diva Jean Horton (Dame Maggie Smith) and equally diva -ish longer retired Reginald Pajet ( Tom Courtenay). Between them must be resolved first the issues that ended their marriage issues he has never gotten over. And second her loss of confidence in her singing ability so that she can participate in an upcoming fundraiser needed to keep the retirement home open. We can be almost confident how the story lines will be resolved but the brilliance in the writing is to keep us just enough unsure such that the dramatic tension holds through to the end.<br /><br />The real story line in quartet and the reason why I will not shrugged it off as a light comedy is in the nature of the personalities involved. The most immediate fact is that these are old people very aware that they are losing all of their individual capabilities due to their advancing age. These people are very aware that death awaits them impatiently. Secondly these people are all artists used to performing at very high levels. All have had to make sacrifices in the name of their artistic skills and now they are facing the fact that they must now sacrifice their standings as artists. There is an old expression \\"nothing quite focuses the mind like the certainty that one is to die in the morning\\". A premise of quartet is that to the degree that these minds can focus; they are aware that time is against them. Consequently decisions that have been delayed for years have to be attended to rapidly and in such a manner as to leave them neither compromised nor dissatisfied with their decisions. Ultimately these are people who choose to enjoy the time that is left to them.<br /><br />Besides a very well written story, a first class team of actors and one of those classic British Manor home film sets; Quartet is graced with the plethora of enjoyable small things. There is a 2 to 3 second image of a young girl in a white summer pinafore running across a green grass trailing a red shawl. It is visually breathtaking. There is a similar visual of Dame Maggie Smith in a simple, regal turquoise dress suit striding into the dining room which again speaks to what superb cameramen can achieve. Dir. Hoffman has filled the retirement home with real musicians. They are honored in the closing credits and they honor us with beautiful musical interludes throughout the movie.<br /><br />Something else Dustin Hoffman gets correct is that faces do not have to be conventionally beautiful to be beautiful. If there is one thing that American movies tend to render boring it's conventionally beautiful faces. From beginning to end quartet is filled with faces that are not normally allowed in close-ups and the movie is better for this decision.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of small-scale movies that do not require lots of flashing lights or loud noises or huge scale issues. Quartet is homage to art, to artistry and a movie that respects and therefore honors the elderly. This movie could have become maudlin or morose. It has more than a few cliches except that they are all used in creative and original ways. If you haven't figured it out yet I like this movie and I recommend it without hesitation.nt home with real musicians.

1419705644|4.0|This is a great little book written from Abadeer's perspective on the Land of Ooo and its many inhabitants, with margin comments by Marceline, Finn, and Jake. It should be noted however, that there is no \\"new\\" information in this book. Perhaps to some who haven't seen all the episodes (or are just starting to get into the show), some sections may certainly help clear things up, but for the most part this is a book made to accompany the existing canon in a more streamlined fashion rather than give insight into unknown aspects of the Land of Ooo.<br /><br />The book's sections are as follows:<br /><br />-- Detailed bio pages on Finn, Jake, PB, Marceline, Ice King, Lady Rainicorn, and LSP.<br />-- A-to-Z mini bios on recurring / minor characters<br />-- A mini glossary on Wizards<br />-- A mini glossary on Princesses<br />-- Ice King's fanfiction (made to look as though drawn and written by Ice King himself)<br />-- An instruction manual for BMO<br />-- PB's Travel Guide to the Candy Kingdom and Beyond<br />-- Marceline's Travel Blog for Demon Backpackers<br />-- Excerpts from The Enchiridion<br />-- Abadeer's Novelty Spells and Cures<br />-- Rather creepy end pages which I will leave you to discover for yourself, but let this be a warning that it may not be appropriate for young children.<br /><br />Now as much as I enjoy the consistent writing style and voice throughout, there are some missing characters whose absences I can't really understand, particularly when Abadeer really has no business knowing a few of the characters that /were/ included in the book. Granted, I understand that not every single character can be included, but I can't really make a case for every character that was included in the book either.<br /><br />Off the top of my head, here are a few notable characters missing from the A-to-Z mini bios:<br /><br />-- Flame Princess (I would just like to point out that she only \\"appears\\" twice: First in Finn's bio pages when she's described as his \\"rebound fixation,\\" and second in PB's guide to the Fire Kingdom when she's described as the Flame King's \\"very hip teenage daughter.\\" That's it. Nothing else about her.)<br />-- Gumball Guardian<br />-- Cosmic Owl<br />-- Pillow People<br />-- Island Lady<br />-- Prismo<br />-- Psychic War Elephant<br />-- Bounce House Princess<br />-- Lady Rainicorn's parents (as a preemptive note to the angry commenter, Jake's and LSP's parents are included.)<br />-- Sleeping Magi<br />-- probably several others.<br /><br />In short, I still very much enjoyed Abadeer's humor in this book and, while I don't really understand how some characters were included over others, I would recommend this as a gift to anyone who enjoys Adventure Time, provided they understand that they won't really receive any \\"behind the scenes info,\\" as one reviewer has criticized. Read the book description provided by Amazon before you decided whether you would like to purchase the book; it'll save you a world of imagined disappointment.nd fixation,\\" and second in PB's guide to the Fire Kingdom when she's described as the Flame King's \\"very hip teenage daughter.\\" That's it.

B00BB8RKH6|4.0|The opening scene was great; that chick was HOT. I liked the visual of the plane flying upside down, very creative. Think about how many addicts try to blame their problems on others, just like Denzel did in the movie. Drunks and druggies seem to have excuses for everything that goes wrong in their lives, except for the main cause, the booze and/or drugs.<br /><br />I liked how he shocked the court by admitting EVERYTHING instead of constantly trying to hide behind everyone.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Loved the book...didn't like the way it ended. The book didn't answer any of the lingering questions. The ending didn't even give off clues of what might be next. However I still loved reading it and I now can not wait for the next!
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Lets start with the good part. The scenery was &#34;digitally&#34; beautiful. Well now that we are done with that part...<br />1) Acting was forced, I did not care for one character in this movie. Dorothy should land her house on all of them.<br />2) Speed, each scene took forever and needed to be edited down. Was there an editor to this film? Did Disney say hey we need a film that is over 2hr long...make it so.<br />3) Cheesy 3D effects, wow here is a place we can put a object going towards the audience it takes away from the story but who cares. Hey we have 3d in this film, you know what was invented in the 1960's. If you didn't, we will push it down your throat.<br />4) Spoiler: Meg is this wicked witch of the west. Enough said.

B002UBRFDC|5.0|I read this when it first came out and was saving this for long flight abroad but couldn't resist and read it again.  I' m a fan of long novels and of the author and most likely will pick up his other works in digital format now that I have a Kindle. Of course good writing and subject matter had lots to do with my enjoying this the second time around. Good for understanding the culture then and now and the descriptions of events are excellent.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I've never been a fan of the Bond franchise (even when Casino Royale came along and Daniel Craig made his debut), but with this film, I'm hooked. The plot was engaging, the villain was creepy and fantastic (and Javier Bardem did such a great job in the role), and M was awesome as ever. And although I miss the old Q, I highly approve of the new one. For the first time in my years of watching James Bond, I am actually looking forward to the next Bond film.
B0093X805W|5.0|This was THE book that got me interested in reading when I was in 2nd grade.  My teacher (who I had a crush on) read it to us and I found Charlie a relatable character.  Now that I'm 30 it is just as much fun to read. I love this book.  I also want to say that I hate the Johnny Depp version of this movie and will probably always hate any Tim Burton movie that comes out from now on,
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft. the only thing is, is that it freezes up my kindle for about six hours I have to entirely shut down my kindle. its an awesome game besides that. worth the money you paid for. xbox version is much much better though.

B00AG6Z92C|2.0|The orchestra sounded great, but they drowned out Andrea's voice--microphones were too close to orchestra--faulty recording.  I love his voice, but didn't even sound like him

B00819ER0Q|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I'm a big fan of quality science fiction anyway. I can't believe I waited this long to see this. Anyway the acting was very good. Carrey can do the drama; and Ed Harris is as good as ever! This premise was so current with all the reality shows on T.V. these days. It also shows you what can go wrong when our privacy is not is invaded.
B00DDQTKHM|5.0|I admit it. I'm a David Meerman Scott fan. I've read all of his books and every edition of The New Rules of Marketing & PR. This new edition brings new stories, new social media methods, and new approaches for real-time marketing in any organization.<br /><br />I've used many of David's techniques in my own business--using my blog to expand my thought-leadership presence, using Twitter to bring more people to my blog posts. And my own book (coming soon) started one blog post at a time, using the \\"new rules\\" to get customer feedback and real-life stories to hone the content.<br /><br />I think of The New Rules of Marketing and PR as \\"agile marketing.\\" We all want to be more nimble and more in-touch with our markets. David shows you how!
B009NLC1D6|5.0|I enjoyed this movie because; although I knew about Mahatma Gandhi, I really did not know the whole story. I thought Kingsley did an outstanding job! He looked so much like the real character! It was amazing! The concept of Passive Resistance was such a masterpiece of strategy by Gandhi for those times. I can see why Dr. King used it in the Civil Rights  era in this country.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|What a great surprise this one was. The cast was great...there are never enough movies with Stanley Tucci and Ewan McGregor. It was wonderful to see Nicholas Hoult again and Bill Nighy's voice is classic! I love Ewen Bremner as well as he always adds comic relief. Great lovable and hate-able characters. Fun family fun...the giants could be a bit scary for young audiences.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Excellent game for people of all ages! Very funny and entertaining especially when you watch young kids play it. It's a good game to fight boredom and it's FREE!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Downloaded this for my darling BF and may have made a mistake because this is all he wants to do is play this game. hahahah so be careful who you download it for they may ignore you for a while.  ALL in good fun of course
B008M7JODC|5.0|And I have to admit I crushed on Peter a little :)  I ended up watching all seasons and appreciate the writers ending it well instead of leaving us hanging, upset, or confused.
B00006FDCD|5.0|I love the book [[ASIN:B002SR2PKG It]] and I love this 1990 television mini-series, although it's the reason I abhor clowns nowadays.<br /><br />There's a great cast of characters - Richard Thomas, the late John Ritter, Annette O'Toole, Seth Green, Harry Anderson, and, of course, Tim Curry - the perfect demented man to play Pennywise the demented clown.<br /><br />The series is a little dated feeling since it was made in 1990 but the creepiness comes through.<br /><br />The show is 187 minutes long, since it was a mini-series and not a movie so be prepared to sit through it. It's better all in one sitting IMO.<br /><br />NOTE: The DVD has half the series on one side and then you need to flip the DVD over to watch the rest.<br /><br />This is a keeper show for me and I pull it out every couple of years and watch it again. And it seems I always notice something new when I re-watch it. I loaned my last copy out and never got it back so just got this copy and it WON'T be loaned.

B00DQQZNZW|5.0|The songs are ok - there are a couple standouts that are truly great - but it's Stuart Price that makes Electric go. It's a very very enjoyable listening experience thanks to his production. It's as if he puts the Pets, melodies ABOVE the songs...and the base songs he's produced are hardcore dance and very electronic. Excellent album. Good choice by Chris and Neil.

B0041KBWM0|5.0|This is an exceptional, full-length adaptation of Austen's classic. What is especially good about this version is that the lead actress shows an astute understanding of the title character. Emma is a silly, over-indulged girl raised by an ambitious governess and a self-involved elderly father. Emma is a busybody without sufficient information to take on the responsibilities she imposes on herself. That said she has neither guile nor ill-will toward any of her victims. No doubt this is why she is beloved by so many especially Mr. Knightly, portrayed here by Johnny Lee Miller who makes up for being a tad too young in the role with his intelligent interpretation. To date this is the best adaptation of the novel I've seen. Romola Garai is just about perfect as a funny, scatterbrained, spectacularly beautiful Emma.

B00985E3UG|5.0|This book is so well written, documented, well paced, and relevant that it was over the top awesome !  The inside information Moss was able to get from documents and interviews, etc. makes this some of the best investigative reporting I've seen in a long time.  My husband and I were so disgusted by what we learned we actually went through our cupboards and threw out stuff we had been eating for years.  He doesn't SAY the processed food industry is wrong, but he puts all the data in front of you and makes sure you understand that companies operate for profit.    If they didn't  park their inner conscience at the door each morning, they probably wouldn't stay in business.  If we don't use our innate ability to choose what we eat and when, then we are just as guilty of parking our consciences at the bedside each morning when we get up.  Worth every penny.  Give up your processed food for one day or one week and use the money to buy this book.  Even if you don't agree with the info, at least you'll know who the top players are and you can go buy some of their company's stock (and get a good return for investment!).

B000002A46|5.0|Continuing my Mariah Carey Album track by track reviews.<br /><br />Merry Christmas is Mariah's 4th major studio album (excludes her MTV EP) and one of the best selling Christmas albums of all time. Vocally, this is album among Mariah's most impressive and the album features 3 original songs to go a long with a bunch of holiday classics.<br /><br />1. Silent Night: Mariah sings this classic with a mostly restrained breezy vocal. 8/10<br /><br />2. *All I Want For Christmas Is You: This became a holiday classic as soon as it was released. 10/10<br /><br />3. O Holy Night: One of the greatest vocals ever as Mariah makes this song her own. 10/10<br /><br />4. Christmas (Baby Please Come Home): Super fun and bouncy! 9/10<br /><br />5. *Miss You Most: A depressing though still lovely Mariah ballad. 9/10<br /><br />6.

I did swallow some of my own vomit when I saw the advertisement for this recycled Hollywood garbage.  get this crap off my amazon.  wtf?  you don't have to advertise every stupid mainstream crap to me.<br /><br /> you should realize from my buying habits that i am not interested in this and stop trying to shove this sort of crap down my throat...  I buy enough from amazon as it is, and I find these advertisements offensive.  you personalize the store to suite my buying trends, well, trend recycled Hollywood crap that is only viewed because of popular name actors off my site...
B0052VUNHC|4.0|Good book I just don't like how controlling the boyfriend is and how ok Abby is with it.... but I guess that is how the author intended it
B008Q0AJA2|5.0|Love this movie. Entertaining and pretty fun actually. Jim Carey offers a great performance despite the low budget-ness of the film. The story is slowly paced at times but the laughs are there.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|The writing in this PBS series is awesome on blu ray. The costumes & sets are authentic and stunning. I couldn't wait to come home & catch up with this family each evening.

B00COHAUD4|4.0|This was a great switch up on the genre. I was glued to it until they screwed it up at the end, making it maudlin, predictable and cheesy.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I loved this book. It simultaneously made me feel like a kid again while still feeling like an adult. Bittersweet.
B00A77II0U|4.0|I played this game with my two boys and we loved it!  MY 5 year old found some scenes a bit scary but overall fun.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because we had a few glitches towards the end of the game where it froze my screen (I have a Kindle Fire) and would have to totally reboot my device in  order to get it working again!  Looking forward to buying another game from this developer and was well worth the money spent.

1781162646|3.0|A little disappointed in Joyland. Stephen King doing his story telling thing, which he is extremely gifted at doing! Not the \\"horror\\" story I thought it would be. Read through it very quickly. Not surprised to find SK's political views at the end. Just about the time I started thinking: WOW! He has really returned to his old style story telling, with no politics mentioned.......like back before he became famous. Bam! Right in the kisser with his liberal loving, conservative bashing, comments! I don't recommend this book.......and I'm sorry I wasted the money to buy it.

0345472322|4.0|As businesses, school districts and individuals consider the insights Dweck offers, based on her massive research and studies, I am hoping our cultural pendulum swings back toward greater awareness of personal responsibility, the value of honest effort and team building based on shared accomplishments. Based on her research, I know of at least one school that is making a choice to change how teachers praise and critique students...exciting new possibilities are unfolding!<br /><br />Vacuous praise has harmed many children, and many of us as children, creating an entitlement attitude that undermines authentic effort, individual growth and community in many directions.<br /><br />Dweck makes her case clearly. Juxtapositioning of stories from business and sports of both growth mindset and fixed mindset people as who are often recognized leaders in their fields, as well as students and less famous souls, helps define the positive outcomes of being a growth mindset person.<br /><br />This is a valuable book. Thank you Dr. Dweck and all who helped you make an important contribution to other people's lives.<br /><br />The four stars rating, (not five) is because I tend to like spiritual grounding in my reading, believing that spiritual values are important to all growth. This is completely secular, but it is easy to see the spiritual implications of the work and it's applications for our spiritual growth.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Going &#34;gluten free&#34; is only HALF the solution to a serious dietary problem Americans are facing.  &#34;Wheat Belly&#34;, written by a physician goes into the history of wheat and how what we call wheat today is a product of serious genetic tinkering and bares no resemblance to what our ancestors as recently as the early 20th century used in their breads.  I was startled and sickened to know that wheat as we know it was &#34;bread&#34; not for nutritional value, but for higher yields and ease of harvesting.  Dr. Davis goes into great detail that a layperson can understand why eating cereal grains is bad for you and why it could be the reason for the rise in cases of celiac disease and other metabolic conditions such as diabetes.<br /><br />Although I didn't read this book until I was well into my wheat-free lifestyle I am glad I did.  It only furthers my resolve to continue living wheat free and modified &#34;Paleo.&#34;  Be prepared to clear out your pantry and change your life for the better.
B00AG51RU6|4.0|The movie is a suspense-type chase film by a first-time director. Interesting for fans of Henry Cavill as this is the first movie where his character is the major focus and he is not competing with a cast of thousands and/or CGI special effects. He does a pretty good job considering he is working with a very thin story line and not much guidance from the director. Bruce Willis makes a brief appearance as his father and Sigourney Weaver plays her part with gusto. This film has some major pacing issues but I found myself enjoying it in spite of its flaws. I give it 4 stars because I did like it but I am just not sure it would be to everyone's taste..
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Don't like the new format as much as the previous format.  But I still love the app and it is really a necessary app to have.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Too much repeating of other books in series.  Curled toes, some phrases used too much.  Disappointed, dragged on way too much.  What is wrong with writing one book instead of 4?  Too much filler.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Just when you think everyone is happy...oh can't spoil it for you.  JUST WATCH IT....YOU WILL LOVE IT!!  Can't wait for Season 4.

1416583432|4.0|As a dog trainer currently enrolled in a training school, I have a long list of books about dogs to get through. Over 60!<br /><br />Inside of a Dog wasn't on my recommended reading lists, but I decided to pick up a copy I found after my aunt gave me a little Christmas money.<br /><br />Pros: It has some solid science, however much of it isn't discussed in detail. A lot of her mentions are one or two sentences long, and this is disappointing.<br /><br />Cons: Very dry at times. This book is written as if it's aimed at researchers, and seems to use big words just for the sake of it. Maybe that is the way the author speaks in real life or at her job as a college professor and researcher. Although I could understand everything in the book, some of its contents were lost of my older aunt who is just an average joe. She put the book down after a few chapters.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game, it's awesome. The only thing is that you may end up spending more money to buy better dragons and treats..<br />But still worth it. Also, you could never go wrong with rearranging your park!

B00CU8OVIM|3.0|If you're a J. Cole fan you know the guy is smart, has good delivery and can be creative.  What's more you know he comes from several backgrounds and isn't just another dude from the street rapping about drugs and bitches.  So I was disappointed with how much the album devolves into talkin about the role bitches and sex play in his life.  Obviously as a guy who is blowing up we know that's the case, but he is better than that.  I hate to see a guy with real talent who could have the ability to better the rap game with his talent just live in it.<br /><br />You hear songs like Crooked Smile and Runaway and you know that J. Cole could be an impactful artist.  You hear songs like Viluminati and you see the lyrical and delivery talent he has.  He has the whole package, he just underutilized it in this album wasting time talking about monotonous, meaningless topics like bitches.
B0092AKDQK|4.0|These are very short-time CD's totaling about 980 minutes which could have  been packed neatly in 12-13 CD's, not 21.<br />For nostalgics' sake the LP covers could be nicely arranged on those 12 too.  Who cares about covers, anyway ?<br />This is essentially a chamber music collection.  The inclusion of three concertos  (i.e. Mozart's 5th Violin concerto, Brahms' Double & a Vivaldi double ) is poor taste, especially in the Mozart, where Piatigorsky could only be sitting in the audience !!  The orchestras ( except for the Brahms) are mentioned simply as chamber orchestra, without word about conductors.  The Beethoven string trios were not available outside the large collections since the 1970's.  Now, instead of putting them on 2 CD's, side by side as was first released on LP's, they are scattered in three different places.  Bad taste  like this abound throughout this collection.  Perhaps the most problematic is two (2) performances of Dvorak's String Quintet, Op. 81.  The performances are very similar, only miked & recorded differently.  How can you justify this nonsense ?  Now, a few good words :<br />The sound is excellent throughout.  The transfers are seamless & the tempos do not sound rushed at all.  I think the performance of Suite italienne by Stravinsky is superb & unforgettable.  Recommended for the fans of the old chaps only.
B002RI9HUM|4.0|Well founded exploration of mental illness, addiction, denial and recovery. Fast-paced and engaging. Ill read another Keyes in the future.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Fun to play. It needs more explanation for each level. I wish it was easier to earn gold bars. Really fun to play for kids and adults.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Like many of you, I had been waiting for this book to be released for a very long time. And it seemed like every-time I checked Goodreads, the release date kept getting pushed back later and later. I told myself, that this book better be worth all this wait and suspense.<br /><br />The 2nd book in the series Reflected in You, ended with so much happening. First off we got down to the root of what happened in Gideon's past and what is behind all those terrifying nightmares. Second Gideon may or may not be responsible for the death of Eva's half-brother who had brutally raped her when she was younger. With all the new revelations and unanswered questions, I dove into Entwined with You as soon as I picked it up from the library.<br /><br />Was this book everything I was expecting it to be? Honestly, No. Was it enjoyable to read? Absolutely! I really was expecting this book to wrap up the love story for Eva and Gideon. However even before I picked up the book, Sylvia Day announced that there was going to be a 4th book. I was initially thrilled about the idea, but after reading this book I began to change my mind.<br /><br />If I love a character and a story I of course would love to read more about them. However not if is adding more books to the series takes away from the integrity of the story line. And this is what I felt happened with this series. With the decision of expanding the series, I felt like Entwined with you ended up being a filler book. Yes, there are some new twists and turns with the story, some new plots introduced, and it wouldn't be a Crossfire book without some AMAZING sex scenes. But could have all of that been included and the story have wrapped up? Absolutely!<br /><br />But on to some good things. I have to admit that I was one of the readers who discovered this series after finishing the 50 Shades of Grey series and wanting to read another story about tortured love. But I have to admit that apart of me ended up liking this series even more than 50 Shades. I love how both Gideon and Eva have a difficult past that they must over come to be together. Who better to understand what you are going through than someone who has had a similar upbringing. When one of them is having a hard time, the other is the rock that holds them. Their love is raw and pure and unconditional. Seeing them grow as a couple is what saved this story for me. And I'm hoping that the 4th and hopefully last book in the series, brings us the closure that we want to see for Eva and Gideon.n 50 Shades.

B007ZI06FE|5.0|A compelling story set in an alternative late 19th century London, England.<br /><br />In this version of history, much of the male aristocracy is infected with a 'craving' virus that makes them yearn for blood.  They are not vampires as they still retain some of their human morals, or at least as many morals as these titled gentlemen ever had.  Upon the death of her father, Honoria Todd and her siblings have been forced to flee the city for the comparative safety of Whitechapel.  She is being sought by Lord Vickers, who has placed a huge bounty on her.<br /><br />He's not the only one searching for her.  Blade, the man known as The Devil of Whitechapel has also been keeping his eye on her.  He is also afflicted with the craving virus, though he uses his increased strength to help protect those in his neighbourhood.<br /><br />I liked the character of Honoria.  During that time period, there were limitations to womens jobs and she has strived to maintain suitable employment for a middle class.  Blade is a much more complex character.  He has experienced horrors at the hands of the aristocracy, yet he still cares for and protects the people of Whitechapel.  Yes, he wants Honoria for his own devious purposes, but he tries so hard not to take unfair advantage of her.<br /><br />In classic steampunk style, steam machines, mechanical devices and other technology play a role in the story , but they don't take over.  They continue to play a supporting role that allows for far-fetched feats of strength  and firepower to fit into that time.<br /><br />I totally enjoyed this book and the developing relationship between Honoria and Blade. Note, there are  detailed sexual scenes  in this book, though they are not the main focus.
B005MLOKXA|3.0|MOre of a soap opera than presentation of legal cases but interesting anyhow.  Better than most TV shows and worth watching if you can put up with soap operas to follow legal issues.
B0049J3QAY|5.0|Awesome movie! Great entertainment for kids and adults alike. Looking forward to a sequel when sully and boo meet again:)
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|Why did it take me so long to read this book? Because I definitely thought it was so cool! I absolutely loved the storyline. It's awesome to see a fairy tale retelling done like this! I am a big sci-fi lover, so this book really worked for me. We get the classic tale of Cinderella, but with a crazy modern twist! It's set in the future after World War IV in New Beijing (after old Beijing was destroyed in the war). We have entered the world of androids, ID chips, and hovercrafts. The inner geek in me was screaming in excitement. Oh and Cinder? Yeah, she's a cyborg. I will admit at first I was confused. I was like ok, is she a human with cyborg parts? Is she a complete cyborg? (Cause I don't think I'd be into that). Once I figured it out (she's a human with cyborg parts), I felt a lot better because I was having trouble visualizing her. I did find some parts more gripping and engaging than others, but I was interested in enough in the overall story that I found it easy to work through those parts. (Not to mention I've heard a lot of people like Scarlet a lot better, so that was motivation enough to keep going)<br /><br />Again, the biggest thing I loved is the idea behind the story. We not only have the retelling of Cinderella, but we also have a plague that is raging across New Beijing infecting and killing many, an evil queen that is bent on marrying the prince, and the fear that Lunars (a race of people from the moon who have magical powers) are living in New Beijing. The ending seriously bummed me out and I am definitely looking forward to getting my hands on Scarlet!<br /><br />I really liked Cinder. She was a tough heroine who, while under the guardianship of her 'step-mother', was forced to be obedient and help bring in income for the family. Yet, Cinder has spunk and attitude and I really liked that she wasn't this weak, complacent girl who couldn't take care of herself. She is very much a take charge kind of girl and even when circumstances are not the most ideal for her, she is not a damsel in distress. She is very conscious of the fact that she is different and that cyborgs are not looked too kindly on. It doesn't matter how much of her is cyborg or the fact that she can't even cry- her self consciousness really shows her human side. Cinder gets quite a bit thrown at her in this book. She is dealing with a less than ideal family situation, a prince who has taken an interest in her, and a plague that has taken one very dear to her. What's a simple mechanic to do?<br /><br />Let's talk romance for a moment. As I said a certain prince has taken an interest in Cinder. Kai is young and handsome. He first meets Cinder at her booth after having heard she is the best mechanic in New Beijing. After a few more chance encounters, Kai invites Cinder to be his personal guest at the ball. I liked that there was no case of insta-love here. In fact, I was often left wondering- does he even really like her at all? Or is he using her to avoid Queen Levana? I know everyone was all like you're going to swoon over Kai... well, I didn't really. Sure, I liked him, but there wasn't enough between the two of them to make me really form an attachment to their 'romance'.<br /><br />I am definitely looking forward to continuing the series to see how everything is going to take shape. I know we will be introduced to new characters essential to the plot and I am very curious as to the direction in which Meyer will take this series. Again, the storyline alone is enough to keep my interest piqued! Bring on Scarlet!

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Awesome book! I initially read this book because it was becoming a movie and I always read the books first. This book was GREAT! I cried, laughed, my heart raced, and my heart fluttered. If you love Nicholas Sparks then you'll love this book.
B008NA3I30|4.0|A thoughtful and intelligent movie which looks at the relationship between a husband and wife through a pair of eyes that I think many of us marrieds recognize.<br />All of the actors did a fantastic job. The soundtrack is pretty and the cinematography is stunning.<br />It's slow moving, yes, but in the way a poem is.<br />I loved it and definitely recommend seeing it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is a completely different book than what I usually read. It is a wonderful book with a different ending that I was not expecting. I highly recommend this book not only because it is a movie and the book is always better than the movie but because you can feel the emotion, hurt, confusion and everything in between in this book.
B001EJV276|5.0|Possibly one of the best inspirational movies of all time.  I appreciate the true story of the hard work to accomplish a personal goal when no one thought it was possible.

B004H4XDBI|5.0|I fell in love with Mia in If I Stay (and also fell a little in love with Adam through Mia). Her story was so heartbreaking, filled with raw emotion and heavy choices. Where She Went is narrated by Adam, instead of Mia, three years after she wakes up from her coma. Mia left Adam behind for Julliard and never looked back. Now, Adam's band has taken off and the fame isn't what he thought it would be. He's no longer in love with music and still hasn't mended the broken heart Mia left him with. A chance meeting, or perhaps some would call it fate, brings the two back together and Adam finally gets the answers to his questions.<br /><br />I LOVED this book, like REALLY LOVED this book. There are so many similarities between If I Stay and Where She Went that made me love the book even more. The chapters once again bounce back and forth between the present and memories from the past. You will fall even more in love with Mia and Adam, and can feel his heartbreak over losing Mia. It's raw and powerful emotion. Since the story is told from Adam's point of view, some of the writing reads as poetic (which I loved) which fits in perfectly with Adam's lyric writing. The bits and pieces of lyrics from his album post Mia really gives a little insight to him as a character (there are so many beautiful quotes!). I especially loved the epilogue with is written as an article about Adam Wilde three years after the main story takes place. It gave us a small look into his future, as well as Mia's. After the article, are the lyrics to several of his \\"new\\" songs which also give you further insight into what's going on with Mia and Adam and where their lives are headed. I just really can't say enough how much I loved this follow up to an already fantastic book (If I Stay). I will definitely be reading everything that Gayle Forman writes. She is a force to be reckoned with.

It's really fun, and you have the options to personalize the appearance of the texting bubbles, create your own profile name and picture, and you can send pictures to your friends! It has a very smooth and modern look, it sends fast, and works great!<br /><br />My only complaint is that when I compare it to the Samsung Galaxy S III version from the Google Play Store, I could see that the Kindle Fire version was in need of an update. It also stopped a few time on the first run, but I was able to get it fixed.<br /><br />&deg;VERY GOOD&deg; app tho -- Download it and see what you've been missing out on!

B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Bad game. I was trying to find something that wasn't as expensive as Minecraft PE, and survival craft looked like a good alternative. I downloaded it and the first thing I realized were the horrible graphics. It was nothing like Minecraft!!! And really u have to be specific as in a Bay Horse. You couldn't have just called it a horse. I would so much rather pay $6.99 for Minecraft PE. If I could I would give this app -1 stars. I'm so upset.

B004IFYMYI|5.0|I recently gave in and finally bought a Blu-ray player, and so I went shopping for some movies I wanted to revisit for the first time in a long time. In this case, it's probably been 20-25 years since I last saw \\"Taxi Driver\\".<br /><br />Seeing \\"Taxi Driver\\" after such a long time really took me by surprise. Sure I remembered the 'classic' scenes and lines (\\"You talkin' to me?\\"), but there were so many other things that I had outright forgotten. Such as: how Travis (played by incredibly young--and skinny--Robert de Niro) finally manages to get a date with the woman of his dreams Betsy (played by incredible young--and beautiful--Cybill Shepherd), only to then promptly ruin it by taking her to the \\"movies\\". Or Travis' utter paranoia (when flowers intended for Betsy are returned to his apartment, he is overwhelmed by the smell and he worries that \\"I think I've got stomach ache\\"). Or the rather uplifting ending of the movie, which also came as a surprise. Other things that stuck out are that this movie is now a time capsule of New York 1975. It is astonishing to see in what terrible shape New York then was. Really enjoyed the score of Bernard Hermann. I had bought the soundtrack CD some years ago just for that (it also contains some of de Niro's musings seen in the movie).<br /><br />As to the Blu-ray edition: the colors are quite nice but since most of the movie plays out at night, there isn't as much opportunity for the color to truly shine (compare that to, for example, the Blu-ray for the 50th anniversary of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\", which I also recently bought here). As to the bonus materials, there is so much of them that it's almost overwhelming. I enjoyed sampling them. The \\"Making of Documentary\\" is my favorite of the bunch, but there are many, many others. It also includes 12 supersize postcards with stills from the movie. Not really sure what to do with them once you've looked at them once. But bottom line is that \\"Taxi Driver\\" remains an outstanding, if divisive/controversial, movie but with the passage of time I can only see the legacy of this movie grow in stature. If you are a movie buff, this is a \\"can't miss\\". HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!e/controversial, movie but with the passage of time I can only see the legacy of this movie grow in stature. If you are a movie buff, this is a \\"can't miss\\". HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|We first tried Hill Climb on an iPad and liked it, so when it came out on the Kindle Fire we got it for our kids. It's easy to learn, and challenging enough to keep them entertained for a while.
B008HJGPVO|4.0|Meets my needs.  It is very comfortable to use.  It is a very good size and feels right weight wise.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Don't go into it looking for realism.  There isn't much.  But, it is very entertaining, great stars having fun, lots of humor.  It made me want to see Red II.
B003BLPTB0|5.0|Great pair of Clogs for the price. Most comfortable piece of footwear I've ever owned.  Really give these a consideration, you will not be sorry.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is probably the best produced series ever to be on TV.  I have enjoyed ever minute of it trying to figure out the mind-bending plots in this series.  I only wish the series were longer.  If you are a sci-fi lover, you will love FRINGE!!!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app provides what you would expect to find in a weather forecast as well as warnings, radar sand multiple locations. It is easy to use. I looked at other apps before selecting this one. What else can I say.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|The story of Shin Dong-Hyuk is both horrifying and spell binding.  He is a person who was raised without any inkling of human kindness and cooperation.  It was a constant fight for survival as he competed with his mother and every other human being for enough food to sustain life.  He ate rats, insects and the corn from animal feces.  There was nothing that would teach him of human compassion until he met a man who risked death to tell him of life outside the prison where Shin was born and would die.<br /><br />In a desperate attempt for freedom, and food, he was able to flee the camp.  He is the only know escapee of a North Korean prison of that level.  He has dedicated his life to the mission of spreading information and helping the people who still live incarcerated lives, generation after generation.<br /><br />It is hard to put the book down.  It is gristly and it takes a stomach to start reading it.  Within pages, I was spell bound.  It is a story of human survival.<br /><br />Frances Holliday Alford<br />FrancesHollidayAlford.com
034580404X|2.0|I purchased a used set of books on line just to see why it was such a big seller.  I thought the book was trite and repetitive and could not understand the hype!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It was so good and sad...I sat and cried as I finished it! I've never read a book from this perspective and I would like to again.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|I never suspected I'd fall in love with the story of a slew of fictional lawyers and politicians, but this series has always waiting for more.  The characters are well developed into a contemporary situational drama that is believable and never boring.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Really cool game really good graphics just perfect game. This game is great for people that like third person shooter games.
B00720T26E|5.0|Ummmmm..... So I haven't bought this yet, but if someone could maybe just tell me.... The cover is not in English (in the picture.... So is it really in English or not?<br />Thank you very much!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this game is fantastic! Best game ever! I love it it's worth the money it's awesome! Enjoy it!
B000H6SXMY|4.0|All 40 DVDs arrived shortly after my order and my wife has been bummed since we became cable cutters and only watch via internet. Now she can watch a gang of shows in a row without stopping. Seems like a good deal
B00D37UQ1K|4.0|This was pretty good Sci-Fi, with a touch of romantic comedy thrown in. I think it was a pretty good job and I hope to see a sequal from this film.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|WHEN I FIRST STARTED USING MY FIRE l THOUGHT THE WEATHER APP WAS THE BEST. TWO WEEKS AGO THE FORMAT CHANGED AND NOW IT IS THE PITS. I WAS GIVEN AGNEW WA AS A FAVORITE. I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE AGNEW IS AND I CANNOT DELETE IT.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Awesome movies, way better than previous Batman films.<br />If you haven't seen them, you need to do yourself a favor and watch them ASAP.<br />Michael Cane is the best Alfred ever...
1476733953|4.0|At times I could not put it down. Good science fiction book; although at times, it made me claustrophic since it takes place all underground. Good villains!
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|It does take a few episodes to get it rolling,<br />but once it was about 5 episodes in, my wife and I have a hard time not wanting to start another episode to see what happens next.<br />Definitely would recommend this show.
0307346609|4.0|Good Book. Not quite like the movie, but I haven't finished it yet. Book is a series of interviews about the Zombie War.
0375869026|5.0|I came across \\"Wonder\\" in a Children's Literature course.While reading this book I kept thinking that I need to get my 12 yr old siblings to read this book. Even if the student's do not have any type of disability they can relate to the topics of friendships, lost friendships, bullying, and even the topic of dating. I think this book is an entertaining way to have students reflect on their own relationships and opinions.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I liked the concept that the zombies could regenerate their humanity by loving or seeing examples of love. Nice movie.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|when i looked in to this app i saw all the good comments. but when i opened it just crashsed my whole kindle fire. i do not recommend this app.
B006VFLIYK|1.0|After reading about one-third of the way through this book I gave it up.  Story was implausible and uninteresting.  The writing was weak and unimaginative.  I simply cannot understand the good reviews for this work.  Give me a Mike Connelly or Lee Child novel anytime.
B0083GQKQG|4.0|This is an emotionally compelling movie on a timely and sensitive topic - but overacted, and puzzling if you haven't read the book.
B000641D2Y|5.0|Stupid fun...corny, yes...but good for some real belly laughs! We love this movie, not QUITE as much as the first, but it's one of our Christmas favorites. Love the McCallister family and Kevin is the Dennis the Menace of Christmas!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was a sniveling mess by the time I finished. I absolutely loved it. I think that the moral and the lessons learned in this story are lessons I won't forget. I think this touched me more than it might have had I not been touched, through a family member, by cancer. This just goes to show that we are not immortal we are so devastatingly and breakable mortal. Not only was this a great inspiring  story, it was  a beautiful love story. I someday hope that I could have a love so pure as theirs.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|I haven't seen this movie in ages and have been wanting it for some time...couldn't beat the price! Just watched it last night and it was just as good as when I first saw it when I was 14. Still one of my favorite 80's movies and the story line is still relative in today's culture...
B0064MPXFA|4.0|interesting show with good story lines, good scripts and good characters.  I am glad that amazon has this show, as I missed it during the seasons.
B0017P520U|5.0|Ray Winstone has done an amazing job of characterizing the Old English heroic epic poem Beowolf. The imagery was fabulous. I kept forgetting that I was watching animation. It was that convincing. The castle, the mead hall, and all the characters masterfully came to life in this film. Beowulf is a tragic story and Winstone allows the watcher to feel the emotions of the characters. I watched it twice. Well done!
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Same op same op evertday.Tap algae tap sandollars. Getting new fish takes weeks if at all. Fun inn the beginning then gets tedious.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|These guys are great and create music that the entire family can enjoy....My 2yr old granddaughter even gets into their music and loves watching their videos....For the price you get a lot in this combo package.
B003U4UPHG|4.0|Our family is watching this fascinating series set in our home state of Hawaii. Some of us for the second time and enjoying and learning new things with each episode.<br /><br />We highly recommend Lost!
B001EBWINQ|5.0|Best movie ever made... Casablanca has every element necessary for a classic. War, romance, betrayal, friendship, great music with a memorable theme.. What more can be said?
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I think this is an amazing book.  Every teen should be required to read it.  Charlie is a unique character that you can't help but bond with.  I became so involved in the book and with Charlie's emotions.
B00CBRADU2|2.0|It's a bloody battle with Arnold the Hero...what more can I say?  Gotta love that Arnold's back in the movies though.  Nothing unexpected.
159562015X|1.0|Wow. You buy this sort of thing to get uplifted, not descend into cubicle-think hell. To say that I'm disappointed would be a major understatement. The book and test are absolute garbage. The questions are absurdly strange, many couldn't be answered, and the online survey results are contradictory. The results did not match my personality or \\"strengths\\" at all. I had more accuracy with a free online astrological chart. And the way it \\"typed\\" people was so \\"Business Management 101!\\"  All was geared toward some ideal of successful assimilation into some cookie-cutter management strategy for a cubicle-filled universe of drones trying to be better \\"team players.\\" The book seems like it was written by a straight A eight-grader. It was filled with incorrect punctuation ( i.e., consistent overuse and misuse of commas), and was otherwise poorly edited. Come on, people! WORSE than useless! I want my money back, but it's not worth 20 bucks to give this trash another thought other than to write this review with the hope that I can discourage people from buying it and, thus, save them 20 bucks, 2 hours, and some unforeseen depression. What a waste of time, money, and paper - into the recycling bin it goes. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!
B004UID2LC|1.0|I don't mean to be rude but this, SUCKS. It wouldn't download vevo videos, and I don't get why. But what I do like about it is that the videos you download you can watch them anywhere,even with no wife .
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|I really enjoy this show. I took a chance watching it as I never heard of it and I was very entertained.
044042321X|5.0|I have read all the books, my wife & I have seen all the seasons of the TV show. We both love the entire series. My wife is a huge fan of grahic novels so I thought I will buy the first two volumes for her to see how she likes it. She not only likes it, she loves it. The characters are very well done and the artistry is pretty cool. What better way to read a phenomenal story than as a graphic novel. Definitely waiting for Volume 3.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I found this to be a page turner that I didn't want to put down.......the twists and turns were unexpected and yet, right. Well written.  Going to start the second now!
0812550706|5.0|Everything that needs to be said about this book has been said in the other reviews. I am probably late to the party but this book is amazing. I had heard so much about the book, that I went to wikipedia and read the whole story, even the ending!. I still decided to buy a copy and read it completely. Needless to say, i was drawn in and was as surprised with the ending as would someone who did not have an inkling of what was going to happen. Highly recommended
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game was fun to play and a better quality game than some other g5 games that I've purchased recently.  The mini games were fun and there weren't too many hidden object scenes.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|A nice change from other racing games. fun to play and challenging enough to hold your interest. Lots of fun to play.
B00BSZZA3I|4.0|I like this case very much...coz.. it got a dual color and dual protection. easy to handle. easy to keep the phone and remove to clean it....awesome to watch slideshows and videos.  all in all 'am very much satisfied using it..
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I am a newly graduated married female in the business field, recently hired. This book was a major news flash for me for not being afraid to take positions that require travel and for not taking myself out of position for fear of not being able to balance family and work without even trying. Every woman should read this book period... If you don't think you need to read it you do.. I am a typical overachiever, who extremely benefited from this book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have ever seen.  I hope it continues for many seasons to come
B000QCS8TW|1.0|This goes for the book and the tv show.  It is overt Sexualized so it will make more money and it has ruined what was a good story.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is so great to play with your friends on Facebook or just random YOU'LL LOVE IT  VERRY VERRY MUCH
0618918248|5.0|Clear concise logic. A book for anyone who has questions about how religion and common sense relate to their lives.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|Works great, I have had no problems, I do recommend it easy to hook up and just works like it should!<br />Steve
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series.  It is so worth watching.  I can't wait for the next season to begin.  A must see.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Mr. Rollins does dare to dip into the strange and weird world of quantum mechanics.  Weaves this science into his story and explains it so most of us can come away with a basic understanding.  Still, it's the story's characters and twisting plots that always grip me and won't let me go.  Once again I came away reading the book too fast which only means I'll have to read it again.....and soon!  Keep them coming James Rollins......please
B0000942LT|5.0|I love this album its sharp heavy-metal like sound is a pleasure to my teenaged ears! Although I love each track, \\"So Far Away\\" is my favorite. I really like this album because it's very unique, I also love artists such as Fort Minor Falconer, and Nickelback. So I tend to listen to rock/rap more often than not!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is good but it takes awhile to get enough coins and I only have one horse and I want a other
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Awesome!!!!! Can't wait for more levels<br />This is a great game for using your mind. I will def keep checking for new updates
B00AEBBAEU|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite films of all time. Wonderful to finally own in a format that does the film justice.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|The first part is the Indian music that George loved so much. Ravi Shankar's daughter is amazing. Then it moves into the Rock portion. Eric Clapton was the ring-leader for this concert. He's great as always. There are many highlights but I enjoyed seeing George's son play guitar the whole time with all those wonderful musicians. Seeing Ringo and Paul together was awesome. Many more highlights and a variety of styles of music are what is great about this concert.
B007K8ILUQ|5.0|Just as described. I appreciated the prompt service and reasonable pricing. The movie is a great addition to my Kubrick collection.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|This book, like the rest, is great! I love that Rollins always takes you new places and explores new sciences
B009C643OC|4.0|Great game ,challenging to play, please continue to provide free games that are fun and challenge your skills! Go Amazon!
B0014BECF8|5.0|I ordered this CD because I have always been a big fan of George Michael.  His voice is heavenly and very beautiful.  I put on my music and I danced and exercised for 1 1/2 hours.  I felt great!  I am 49 years old and my whole body just a good workout.  I love is oldies and new songs too.  One of my favorite is &#34;An Easier Affair&#34;.  Its one of the reasons I bought it.  The songs from the past still can get me up and moving.  It was a good choice and worth the money.  I got it used but it is in good condition.  Delivery was fast.  I am glad I got it.  You won't be disappointed.
B001NIAQ9I|5.0|Barbra is at her best! The singing is great and the acting is superb hers and Omar Shariff and both look their best!
B00COO2D6O|3.0|game is just ok.  no big improvements over 1.  wish it had more options for weapons if it is going to charge you.  try the free first
B0046H95PO|4.0|This was a good story.  It kept me wanting to read on and I did not see the ending coming at all.
B00CKJTVHW|5.0|Dexter is the best thing that ever happened to tv. Each season gets better and better. May it never end
B005LAIII0|5.0|Though I'd give this film 4 and 1/2 stars due to a few very minor quibbles with pacing, I'm happy to give it 5 well-deserved stars on Amazon because it is such a relief to see a big movie of this caliber of quality and craftsmanship in 2013. Yes, there are still some fine movies being made (even some of the &#34;tent-pole&#34; blockbusters are satisfying) but 'Life of Pi' is as rewarding and, in its own way, as awe-inspiring as any of the current epic releases helmed by bigger budgets and bigger names. Under genius Ang Lee's impeccable direction the uplifting and absolutely heart-breaking tale of Pi and Richard Parker is brought to spectacular CGI &#34;life&#34; with an added and unmistakable dose of dignified Humanity so lacking today, not only in our movies but across our culture. The film is essentially a parable, in my opinion, about the perception of truth and how the human spirit creates magic out of unspeakable tragedy in the attempt to draw meaning and find redemption where there is little of either to be found. Is it the story of a young Indian boy adrift in a lifeboat on the ocean for 227 days with a Bengal tiger as his simultaneous enemy and companion? That, dear moviegoer or movie-watcher, is for YOU to decide. The exhilarating thing about 'Life of Pi' is that you will be amazed by it, and you will find yourself thinking about it. Most truly. Kudos to Ang Lee and everyone involved with the meticulous and admirable execution of this very special film experience. For those who first warmed to the tale via the  book by Yann Martel, rest assured that the spirit of that classic work is painstakingly preserved and adapted with humility and no small amount of splendor. A feast for the eyes, the senses and, especially, for the heart. Adults will hold this film dear, but if you have kids over age 9 (or maybe 12) get them to watch it with you. I have a feeling they will never forget it. It's actually comforting to know that films this lavish and yet so spirituallypure are still being green-lighted by the deservedly beleaguered Big Hollywood Machine. Hope springs eternal, I guess.
B00B2G2RG6|2.0|I love the story , But the gore is on the screen more than the story. And I liked walking dead which was just as gory. Except it was more brief and something I could look away on. On this if I chose to look away it would be almost the whole episode.
B00006FM77|5.0|If you like early Chicago, you need to have this.<br />This is a very extensive ( 4 CDs ) set, with all lilve music from the three first Chicago works.<br /><br />It comes packaged in a nice box with mini-posters and booklet and each CD comes in a slip cover.<br /><br />But what matter is really the music.<br />The recordings are very raw and very intense. The material, if you are not familiar with early Chicago, is very sophisticated, with amazing intrumentals.<br />Nice Horn sessions combined with hard guitar playing.<br />It reminds me a lot of Frank Zappa in the 70's.<br /><br />If you like Chicago for their latter work, with more radio friendly music, be carefull, this is not what you will find here! It's a lot better though!
0307279189|5.0|I don't read many books but when a friend lent me this book I couldn't put it down.  A great story combined with a lot of information and facts. Recommended.
B007L96VCY|4.0|I alwas passed on this album because I didn't know any of the songs.<br />What a wast of time.<br />Now that it's been remastered and repackaged in a nice way, I decided to give it a try, and it's a very good album.<br />This last remaster series has a very nice package, with several photos of Paul and his family and also sounds great.<br />I highly recomend this album to any fan of Paul McCartney and the Beatles.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Freaking hilarious! Brings a whole new meaning to romantic  comedies. Written from a man's prospective is a breath of fresh air. Can't wait to read the next.
B000E0W24S|5.0|This orchestra simply knows how to play Tchaikovsky, a real triumph , also the best recording of these symphonies that I have in my collection. highly recommended ...!!!
B00CL6GAD2|3.0|Although slow at times it was fairly entertaining. Just needed a bit more action to go with it. Zeta-Jones should have had more to say as well.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|This show keeps you coming back for more every time. It never disappoints with tons of drama and suspense in every episode
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|not what i thought it would be. i heard whispers about it and had my mind made up it was poor. someone asked me to see it anyway.  i couldn't be happier. great flick great effects..
B0064X7FVE|1.0|We had the older version for past year and now they changed it into a pile of crud! HATE the new popups all over the place and radar screen is hard to get working right....will b deleting this app and going weatherbug!!
B004SIP7TE|5.0|first of all, this isn't modern downtown NY. it's from back in the day, when this country was getting out of it's diapers. great action, great scipting,.great acting....... come on,.. ya just have to have to have this.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I had this app for my android and purchased it for kindle fire hd to be able to use it while reading. Love the sound updates and the app improvements. It makes sleeping peaceful for this insomniacs even away from home.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|okay. everyone by now has seen this flick and have their own ideas of is it good or bad. so i won't make mention of my review. i WILL say i am an avid collector and had-to-have this.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I'm always checking the weather using this app.  It's helps me plan my day  and that is all I have to say
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|This book offers much food for thought regarding freedom of choice. And the epilogue by the author is a good exercise in finding what events in your life shape your philosophy of life.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|great lines, amazing acting,, great finish.....everything is phenomenal. Christian Bale shines despite his voice. heath Ledger tears it up and this movie just looks incredible and clear on blu-ray
B0076DELIG|5.0|Excellent if you enjoy Michael Connelly,but a word of warning, if you read one, you will be compelled to read everything the man has ever written he is that good!!
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|My 5yr old really wanted this game, but he doesn't get to play it much cause mom is addicted to it to! Lots of fun, the challenges are very fun but even difficult for adults. Definitely worth the $1!
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's really awesome it's the easiest to craft and stuff it's awesome u can create something without the way you have to do it on the computer it's worth your money I swear it totally is.
B00459EZLW|5.0|One of the best sci-fi shows produced. Too bad the networks didn't see that and cancelled the show. Great storylines, characters, and a very interesting twist on the Stargate theme. This show helped to tie many aspects of the show together (even got to see a &#34;seed ship&#34;; the ships the Ancients used to drop stargates off at planets). The show isn't as &#34;light&#34; and comedic as Stargate SG-1 or Atlantis, but definitely has its humor. It's more serious, and some might say &#34;darker&#34;, but it's not over the top. I liked the exploration of technology, and seeing what the writers perceived to be what the Ancient tech would look like a million years before the tech we saw in Atlantis. That gave things a new perspective that I enjoyed exploring. Again, the show was moving well with great potential for more, and I was disappointed in the powers-that-be who decided the show needed to come to an end. Overall, an outstanding addition to the SG franchise, and I'll enjoy it on Amazon now.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Loved the book. I cannot wait for Winds of Winter to come out. I may re-read the whole series.  Great!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love it. I like to see what the weather is doing the day. I like to see what the weather is in other cities where my family lives.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app. It's great. When I first got it, I thought that it would've sucked. But it didn't!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I honestly dont have a specific opinion about this book but it does remind me that we need to be grateful for each day we have and what we have because one day, an unexpected day, may come and take it. People usually say dont take advantage, but why not take advantage? It may be the last time we ever use it.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|it is a very awesome game with lots of good challenging and exciting levels with power ups new characters and on line gaming
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|It was confusing to me. I couldn't keep up with the story. It was too much &#34;back and forth&#34;.It was hard to read.
B000GOTESO|3.0|Good for wasting an hour or so, fun in a I'll grab a snack from 7-11 kind of way.  It's all good:)
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Joss Whedon and superheroes?  Of course it's great! Cool action sequences along with great one-liners - a very entertaining way to sepend a couple of hours.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|The author, Zusak writes very descriptive and easy to read dialog. I loved the Book Thief, so had to get this one also. I read messenger in one sitting. The suspense kept me to the going. But the end confused me a little when new characters were supposed to explain everything.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This program has really gotten under my skin I can't get enough of there actors or these sets or these costums and what great locations!!
B0040I09RM|5.0|Really enjoyed getting into this series. Always saw its of this series, but I never got involved until recommendation by a friend. Now I can't wait to see the rest of the series.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Bought it for my wife as a gift and I listen to it as much or more than she does.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone that can read!  It was the hardest book for me to finish as I would simply end up in tears.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I wanted a simple calculator for my Kindle, and I love this free download. The buttons are big, making it easy to use in the Kindle format.
B004PGAQMW|5.0|I can watch this movie again and again, and I have.  It's a wonderful way to tell the story of how you can't judge a book by it's cover.  Hilariously written, the acting is top notch and I laugh every time.  This movie is right up there with Toy Story and Shrek.  Highly recommend.
B0087HT36U|5.0|So fun! But the kindle doesn't have any new levels. Not even the cowboy level update. I would love to play t on my kindle again.
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|I love Jane Austen.  I think I own every version of every movie made from her books.  Her stories are timeless and still hold up to this day.  This version of Persuasion is actually very good.  While it may not be full of Hollywood-like pretty actors, they grow on you because you care about them.  It is a well-paced version that does an excellent job telling the story of how people can influence or persuade other people's decisions.  How people worry more about what other people think, than what is right.  It's great viewing for a lazy Sunday afternoon.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this movie \\"Man Of Steel\\". I thought Henry Cavill did a great job of portraying Superman. He brought a human element into it. I thought the movie was more \\"real\\" than the movies of the past which was refreshing. I LOVED that Lois wasn't clueless and was a factor to deal with in her own right. Lots of action. Something for everyone.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I just could not stop reading it.  Now I am looking forward to doing the experiments and changing my life! :)
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Enchanting, scary and fantastical. Adult themes told through the mind of a 7 year old. But don't let that stop you from reading this book. You feel the weather in this story. Every raindrop, wind gust and flapping piece of fabric is made all too real. And yes, it ends well...sort of.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|Well, here's a truncated list:<br /><br />It resists being propelled forward, balking up and sideways.<br /><br />If lifted even briefly when running, it fills the air with clumps of crud.<br /><br />Emptying any collected dirt defies reason. One can open only a port slightly larger than a quarter, over half of the collection chamber. There is another fixed port over the flanking chamber -- transparent so one can admire the captive sweepings.<br /><br />Do the designers want users to rap the sweeper so clotted dirt moves toward the single port? If so, my dust is intransigent. One solution: Use a bend coat hanger to scrap the chamber clear.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a good book for reading and the characters are something I would never touch but it is a good read
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great ensemble, great characters, sharp dialogue and another good reason why cable television is burying the broadcast networks as a provider of original serial entertainment.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|I have enjoyed Christopher's books for some  years and also enjoyed the movie, too bad their wasn't a second.  Oh well.
159463176X|4.0|Just a little addition to the other reviews.  The book has a great psychological theme going through it, of attachment and abandonment, and about how it feels to be an expat from a country in distress, and it is a worthwhile read if only for that reason.  It was not the easiest read for me, he bounced around a lot and started sections in the first person without letting you know who the \\"I\\" was, so after figuring that out I had to go back and pick up on the story.  He tells the stories of several related people, some of which are deeply engaging and one in particular that I found very \\"so what\\" because it went into great detail about mundane things about this one person and yet the connection to the rest of the book was weak.  I know, who am I to criticize this author.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is a very good story for what it is.  Have heard it three times on audio and probably will listed to it again.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Really enjoyed the show. This season the plot gets a lot more intense. Never a dull moment. Cant wait to watch the next season.

B00B6ELPIU|2.0|I like the Knife. I love Fever Ray. Sadly, this reminds me of Metal Machine Music. Listen to the samples before buying it blindly, like I did. I deleted it from my Kindle and went back to listening to Fever Ray.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  It is so difficult today to find good family movies that do not have rude humor or bad language or just poor story lines.  I like how it related to Wizard of Oz in terms of story and cinematography.

B00AEBEQW8|5.0|It's a rare thing indeed when my son and daughter (ages 3 & 6) are both equally engaged in the same book, and me as well, but it has been achieved with the The Day the Crayons Quit.  The kids giggled, guffawed, snickered, went to get their own well-loved crayons to hold while listening to me read, and then wanted an encore presentation immediately upon reaching the end.  The creative premise, the charming illustrations, the hilarious individual letters from the crayons-on-strike all served to make this gamble from the library a book we're now buying for our favorites shelf.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Even for a non runner (which I was before this book--and hadn't ever seriously run) I can't tell you how informative and charming this book is. Yes, it motivated me to start running, but even if i hadn't--and that was a real possibility--this book goes into that category of &#34;I will always recommend&#34; because it was such a great read.

B000SEGTI0|2.0|I was expecting more plot. IMO this book hasn't aged well. A comparison to the film Blade Runner isn't even really a fair comparison as the story arc is somewhat unrelated.
B0096HKZ1M|4.0|Very rarely can one create a 'tongue in cheek' homage to a film genre and make it work.  Re-Animator accomplishes this with flying colors.<br /><br />With solid performances and effective (if not spectacular) special effects make it work.

B0064X7FVE|1.0|To be fair I tried using the new version for a couple weeks but finally just couldn't take it any longer and uninstalled it. The new format is very distracting and makes it very hard to see the data through all the ads and poorly chosen background images. The new navagation scheme is no good either and actually makes it harder to find the information you want. Due to these factors I would certainly not recommend this new version. If they decide to bring back the old version or something very similar to the old version then I would happily reinstall and recommend it. For now I have moved over to the Accuweather app and find that I like it very much - perhaps even better than the original Weather Channel app.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Thor was the only character that I was not familiar with from the Avengers so I decided to check it out. If you are one of the few people who hasn't seen the avengers yet, watch this one first. Great movie.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Good but predictable story line.  Excellent character development.  Beautiful camera work.<br /><br />Worth watching.<br /><br />A good nights entertainment with your spouse.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|Enjoyed this. Read the book and loved it. They follow the book very closely and are true to it. Which was very nice, some movies change the line of the story in a book.

B009MO5960|5.0|Can't wait for the next one. Great action, sound and jump scares.  A big departure from the first film in the series but a better film than the last.

1250007208|5.0|This mix of cyber/android/mechanical parts and fairy tale without any pretty moments at the ball was fascinating.  Meyer has a huge career ahead of her, and though I couldn't say the sequel was better, it was still fascinating and worthy of a very promising series.  Totally dig.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|And the Mountains Echoed by Khaled Hosseini is like a patchwork quilt of many colors.  But while some of the patches are brilliantly colored and well anchored, others aren't quite as bright and are attached by only a few threads.  This novel was still a moving story of families and decisions, but it's not up to the same level as Hosseini's previous novels, The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns.<br /><br />And the Mountains Echoed is a multi-generational story that spans 58 years.  It opens in a small, poor village in Afghanistan.  Abdullah and Pari are children without a mother.  When their mother died in childbirth, Abdullah becomes a mother-figure to Pari, even though they now have a step-mother.  These two are inseparable.  For financial reasons, their father, Saboor, will make a very difficult decision that will change their lives forever.  And it's a decision from which nobody involved will fully recover.  And the Mountains Echoed goes back and forth between the viewpoints of different characters--Besides Abdullah and Pari, there is Abdullah's Uncle Nabi, who works for the rich Mr. Wahdati and his wife Nila in Kabul.  There is Idris, a neighbor of Mr. Wahdati who becomes a doctor in America.  There is the Greek doctor, Markos Varvaris, who ends up renting Mr. Wahdati's house after the fall of the Taliban.  And there is Adel, the son of a drug-lord who befriends a village boy, Gholam.  Gholam's father happens to be Abdullah's half brother.  The story also moves from Afghanistan to Greece to the United States to Paris.  But Afghanistan is where so much of the real drama takes place with the turbulent history of the Soviet Invasion, the battle between the Soviets and the mujahedeen, the rise of the Taliban, and then the invasion by America after 9/11.  This is a story of decisions and lost chances and regrets and duty to family and making amends, and the ending is emotional and bittersweet.<br /><br />As always, Hosseini writes beautifully.  One character is stunningly beautiful.  Her less attractive sister observes that \\"somewhere deep inside, her sister understood dimly that her beauty was a weapon.  A loaded gun, with the barrel pointed at her own head.  Most days, she relished her power to derail a man's thoughts with a single fleeting but strategic smile, to make tongues falter over words.  It blistered the eyes, beauty like hers.\\"  Unfortunately, there were times that I thought some of the sub-plots could be a little better developed, or eliminated altogether.  I would have liked to read more about Idris and Timur and Roshana.  I thought the sub-plot between Adel and Gholam should have either been developed more or deleted from the book altogether.  I didn't think that it added much to the story.<br /><br />Still, Hosseini is an accomplished writer and I enjoy reading about the beauty of Afghanistan and their culture.  While not quite up to par with his first two novels, And the Mountain Echoed is still a very moving and enjoyable novel.s stunningly beautiful.

B001NLKXK2|5.0|The book is a must read, especially if you have had an experience with someone who has the disease.

0345404475|5.0|Warning: While I love the original novel I cannot vouch for this rewritten (re-imagined?) version of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Les Martin. Check out the original story by PKD. Be careful which version you purchase (as of July 2013 it is somewhat ambiguous). Oddly, the original novel seems to be out of print. It is shocking to me to rewrite an author's original work. The intention seems to be to make the original novel more accessible and sanitized for teenagers. PKD is a legend that cannot be improved.<br /><br />At least two distinct reader types turn to Philip K. Dick: Science fiction readers and fans of his movie adaptations (e.g. Blade Runner, Minority Report). If you belong in the second group, you will quickly realize you don't exactly get a page-by-page screen adaptation from PKD. PKD is almost Stephen King-like in his character focus and exposition with all the positives and negatives. Also, things just happen, we read about very surreal events that must be taken on faith, a metaphysical theme is infused throughout the work and some philosophical pondering is included. Welcome to the weird, wild world of PKD if this is your first time.<br /><br />Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? is about a bounty hunter who must track six dangerous androids who have escaped from an off-world colony. The basic theme is similar to the film. Most of the characters from the book make it into the film but Rick Deckard's wife gets dropped. So we get some backstory on her. Many other interesting details are explored (e.g. Deckard's/society's interest in animals and living creatures) so ideas from the film get filled out a little bit. Of course, a whole bunch of bizarre ideas show up.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the film be warned you will be thrust deep into the mind of one of the genre's most eccentric authors. Someone who claimed to have a mystical experience in 1974 and was still struggling to cope with it when he died in 1982. Almost every book he wrote after 1974 explored the key event of his life. PKD is legendary for many reasons and the man himself is as interesting as his work (if not more). PKD's writing style hits the uninitiated squarely in the face. PKD explores a lot of metaphysical and other-wordly issues throughout his works and this is no exception. So don't expect a linear read. One of the main differences between the book and film is the treatment of religion. Religion factors heavily in the book where Mercerism is the dominant religion. It involves an \\"empathy box\\" and linking into the collective consciousness of suffering. There is also a commercial religion that rivals Mercerism on TV. In the world of PKD, nothing is as it seems. This is David Cronenberg or David Lynch type imagination.<br /><br />If this sounds too much for you then you can safely avoid the book. It is unforgettable to me but has a distinctly different tone from the film. I would probably admit the film (Blade Runner) was a little better than the novel. They are very different and appeal to different tastes. If you thought the film was hard to penetrate the novel is even worse. There are many essays available on the Internet analyzing the differences between the film and novel that make interesting reading. Fortunately, I quite enjoyed the original novel and the film as many fans do.<br /><br />This is the best and most accessible of PKD's works. Buy this book.er 1974 explored the key event of his life.

Enough said...watch it and judge for yourself, but don't expect  a happy Hollywood ending all neatly tied up in a bow. It's  real life .... which is what makes  European/Italian films such a masterpieces.

It is sad that this is the finale as Flynn has passed on at too early an age. We will miss him and his great characters.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I agree with the person that questioned the age of the writer. The story was somewhat unbelievable and was really about a young girl that had a emotional tantrum in almost every chapter.<br /><br />If you wish to read a good FemDom book, try a m missy book;<br /><br />My favorite was the Tombstone series of three books; [[ASIN:B009M4031G TOMBSTONE: The Untold Story, The First Sissy Maid]] is the first book set in the 1870's.

0399208534|5.0|This is a classic story that is very popular among children and schoolteachers.  This book tells the story of a caterpillar who eats holes through various fruits and other food items.  In the end, he turns into a butterfly.  This is a simple story with few words. The illustrations are nice.  There are holes in the pages where the caterpillar has eaten through the food item, which is a nice touch that amuses children. This can be used as a bedroom or nursery theme for a baby or child.  Matching bedding and decor can be found at Pottery Barn or online. I used this hardcover book as a baby shower gift for a mother who chose this as her nursery theme. Each guest signed this inside cover or one of the pages with a permanent marker.

140006922X|1.0|Reza Aslan, author of the new book, \\"Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth<br />\\" has been interviewed on a host of media outlets in the last week. Riding a publicity wave, the book has surged to #2 on Amazon's list.<br /><br />Media reports have introduced Aslan as a \\"religion scholar\\" but have failed to mention that he is a devout Muslim.<br /><br />His book is not a historian's report on Jesus. It is an educated Muslim's opinion about Jesus -- yet the book is being peddled as objective history on national TV and radio.<br /><br />Aslan is not a trained historian. Like tens of thousands of us he has been formally educated in theology and New Testament Greek.<br /><br />He is a bright man with every right to hold his own opinion about Jesus--and to proselytize his opinion.<br /><br />As a sincere man, Aslan's Muslim beliefs affect his entire life, including his conclusions about Jesus. But this is not being disclosed. \\"Zealot\\" is being presented as objective and scholarly history, not as it actually is--an educated Muslim's opinions about Jesus and the ancient Near East.<br /><br />\\"Zealot\\" is a fast-paced demolition of the core beliefs that Christianity has taught about Jesus for 2,000 years. Its conclusions are long-held Islamic claims--namely, that Jesus was a zealous prophet type who didn't claim to be God, that Christians have misunderstood him, and that the Christian Gospels are not the actual words or life of Jesus but \\"myth.\\"<br /><br />These claims are not new or unique. They are hundreds of years old among Muslims. Sadly, readers who have listened to<br /><br />interviews on NPR<br /><br />, \\"The Daily Show,\\" Huffington Post or MSNBC may pick up the book expecting an unbiased and historic report on Jesus and first century Jewish culture. (I will let my Jewish friends address Aslan's statement on MSNBC that, \\"there were certainly a lot of Jewish terrorists in first century Palestine.\\")<br /><br />As a journalist and author who is Christian I cannot imagine penning a so-called objective biography of Muhammad and then concealing my conflict of interest in national media interviews.<br /><br />In world history there are no religions more violently and anciently opposed than the crusading, fighting, at times blood-shedding rivals of historic Islam and historic Christianity. Even non-violent Muslims and Christians, like Aslan and myself, understand that we hold aggressively oppositional views--particularly about Jesus. National news coverage of \\"Zealot\\" has ignored this conflict of interest.<br /><br />\\"Zealot\\" is written with the self-assumed authority of groundbreaking revelation from a historian. In reality, it is a religious person's opinion about Jesus--from an adherent to the religion that has been in violent opposition to Christ for 1,400 years.<br /><br />Aslan informs us that we cannot trust the Gospel of Mark--because it was written 40 years after Jesus' death. He then chides us to trust his new book, written almost 2,000 years later.<br /><br />I believe in Aslan's right to hold and propagate any opinion. It's a right that, ironically, Christians do not have in many Muslim countries.<br /><br />My concern is that national media coverage be smart and forthright about this conflict of interest, just as it would be if I--a Christian author and pastor--wrote a book about Muhammad.<br /><br />Pouring praise onto \\"Zealot\\" as new information about Jesus, without explaining its author's devotion to a combatting religion, is blatant bias. This same bias would be unthinkable if the Christian and Muslim roles were reversed.<br /><br />With its riveting demolition of Jesus, \\"Zealot\\" will continue to attract interviews--some from reporters who want to see Jesus deconstructed. Many more interviews will come from reporters who simply don't understand that Reza Aslan has a horse in this race. He is not an objective observer, but, to use his own word, a zealot, with religious motivation to destroy what Western culturehas believed about its central figure for hundreds of years. In many ways, this conflict is larger than Christianity and Islam. It is a conflict of Western and Middle Eastern foundations. These are great and important debates that we should welcome, but let's be honest about our motivations, positions and conflicts of interest as we dialogue.<br /><br />Let's hope reporters in future interviews will, being informed, mention the glaring conflict of interest in this Islamic opinion of Jesus. It is no more objective than my educated views about Muhammad, as a Christian.<br /><br />\\"Zealot\\" is not new work from a historian. It is a sophisticated presentation of views that Muslims have held about Jesus for more than 1,000 years.

B00CWV8TIU|3.0|SIDE EFFECTS begins familiarly enough: a patient Amy Taylor (Rooney Mara) is being treated by her psychiatrist Dr. Banks (Jude Law), who prescribes her different medicines to cure her of depression.  It seems, however, that all of them have side effects (hence the title); one of them being to  reduce Amy into a trance-like state where she does not remember what she is doing.  During one of these periods she inadvertently murders her husband Martin (Channing Tatum).  Sent to a psychiatric hospital for observation, she continues to be treated by Banks.  As the action folds, however, so Banks becomes more and more suspicious; all is not what it seems in Amy's case.  No one believes him: in the end he suffers unexpected side-effects, both personally and professionally.  However he uncovers a plot involving Amy and her former shrink Dr. Siebert (Catherine Zeta Jones).  Director Steven Soderbergh builds up the tension through skillful camerawork, lighting and a taut script to create a d&eacute;nouement full of unexpected twists and turns.  The New York settings conspire to create an oppressive environment that only serve to exacerbate the potential side-effects of Amy's and Banks's actions.  Well worth a watch.

B00CL8D83U|3.0|For those of you who are such fans of the PSB you think they can do no wrong, I am basically on your side. I have been a huge and consistent fan for years. Their music has seen me through the ups and downs for years now. However, I am listening to this album and not much is jumping out of the speakers other than,well.. the beat. The electric amps are certainly fired up, but the songs? I can't seem to believe that I am only (thus far) connecting with 2 tracks. The first is \\"Axis\\",an instrumental track that sounds to me like a majestic homage to the genius of Patrick Cowley and is reminiscent of \\"Menergy\\". (Others compare it to Giorgio Moroder, but neither this nor the rather lame Daft Punk homage to that great talent are able to duplicate the eerie aura of druggy decadence he concocted.) The other track I have(sort of)connected with is \\"Vocal\\". The lyric expresses a rather trifling sentiment, but the chord changes may be familiar to anyone who shows up in a dance club with regularity: one wonders how many times various dance artists will repeat minor variations on the chord structure to \\"Holiday\\" by Madonna? If it sounds familiar, listen to \\"Alejandro\\" by Lady Gaga, \\"Love at First Sight\\" by Kylie Minogue, Madonna's own \\"Get Together\\", and lord knows how many others. As for \\"Love is a Bourgeois Construct\\" (a witty, if weighty title)that should've been on Elysium, which prickled with the pissed-offness and disconsolation of old age; it was a bit like an old geezer in a pub, rambling on too long to make its point. Likewise, \\"Fluorescent\\" failed to illuminate my turntable as I'd hoped. I was intrigued by the inclusion of a Springsteen cover, but it merely left me dancing in the dark. In all fairness, sometimes PSB songs germinate and take time to grow, so I may grow to love any number of these tracks upon further listening. That's part of the genius of their work; also, they sometimes put out fantastic remixes of tracks that fail to inspire in their album versions. All in all, I expect to be quite \\"electrified\\" at their upcoming concert; turn the amps up, Boys, and bring it on! As for your future albums, beware of the \\"Enya Syndrome\\" and I hope you are able to follow your musical hearts; I sometimes get the feeling you would like to give the amps and disco ball a bit of a breather and croon something more akin to an album of torch songs. I'll be in the front row.
0385344228|2.0|The son of the Head ADA is suspected of being the murderer of a classmate. That should have led to a lot of suspense, a bonding with the main characters - the parents  of the suspected murderer. But none of the characters is three dimensional, and I found I wasn't rooting for the son, his mom, his dad....or anyone. I kept waiting to be caught up in the story....and then it was over, and with a strange ending that was less than fulfilling. But at least I was done with the book. Disappointing.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I read this book in one sitting and laughed out loud so much my family started to think i was slightly insane. I even remembered parts about the book at random time during the day and laughed out loud. In other words this book is the funniest, smartest, best thing you will ever read. Also will make you wish you could be friends with Tina!

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|If you liked the old Doctor Who, this is a given; you've got to watch it. If you've never seen the old Doctor Who, you may take a few episodes to really get into the show, but its worth it. The characters are great and the twists and turns that comes with taking on the possibilities of all time and space make it worth watching.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love this game.... really enjoy playing it, find myself replaying levels just for fun. And have passed it along to other friends.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I wish there were more movies like this.  ...Ofcourse there is one (The remake \\"Let Me In\\") ...Both are excellent. ..And both are worth seeing many times.<br /><br />If I could only own one, I would choose \\"Let Me In\\". ..Chloe Moretz may be the most talented and charismatic young actress I've seen in my life. ..In comparison, the interaction between the boy and vampire girl seems less natural in this movie. ..In many scenes both the girl and the boy seem frozen and stiff with unnatural expressions and movements.<br /><br />The vampire attacks in \\"Let Me In\\" are vicious. In this movie, they are tame, slow, and non-graphic. But neither movie is a gorefest. Both are excellent dramas with a unique vampire theme.<br /><br />The most glaring weakness of \\"Let The Right One In\\" is the english dubbing (it's terrible). ..I prefer watching with the original swedish soundtrack and using the english subtitles. This movie also looks very dated. ..If I had not read the 2009 release date, I would have guessed it was a movie from the 60's.<br /><br />10 Star System: I would give \\"Let Me In\\" 10 Stars and \\"Let The Right One In\\" 7 Stars. ..Chloe Moretz (\\"Let Me In\\") is clearly the more talented actress. ..I couldn't resist buying both movies. ..I watch movies non-stop, and I rarely see anything as good as these.

The main character makes you really like her and relate to her, the love triangle she is in is not the main point of the show, but keeps the story going.

B00DBSZJRM|4.0|After having seen all the re-structured fairy tales of late, whether comedy (like Anne Hathaway in \\"Ella Enchanted\\") or rather darker (Catarina Scorsone and Andrew Lee Potts in the mini-series \\"Alice\\") and then truly dark (Hugh Jackman in \\"Van Helsing\\") I wasn't really sure just WHAT to expect from this movie!<br /><br />Honestly, I was thinking 'Gretel as a leather clad biker lookin' chick with a hot looking brother? Probably going to be cliche' at best, B-Grade at worst.'  But I was pleasantly surprised!<br /><br />The plot was the same...kids are left in the woods, nifty house to eat, wicked witch to eat the kids, etc., etc. But I really liked the alternate explanation of the how the kids wound up out there and lost...and why.<br /><br />The acting was great, even if Gretel's character was a bit snooty around the edges, special affects were believable and supporting cast was much better than I expected. Probably wouldn't watch it more than once every couple of years if I owned it but I wouldn't leave the house if visiting a friend who had it playing, so am hoping that Amazon keeps it around til 2015!<br /><br />All in all, I really enjoyed the movie. More reliable still, my 22 year old son, Mikey, liked it.<br /><br />And everyone knows, \\"Mikey won't like it. He hates everything!\\"

B004A8ZX2I|5.0|Possibly one of the most overused quotes from Jim Morrison is \\"there are things known and things unknown and in between are the doors.\\" There is no easy way to sum up the film<br />UNKNOWN, since it is a thriller, as well as an action piece. I suspect that the book, in English translation, which UNKNOWN is adapted from, as many more answers, and probably<br />just as many dead ends. Just as the film THE NINTH GATE was a superbly teased out thread from the book le club Dumas, where certain characters become clear only after reading<br />the book. Playing with the theme of the loss of memory is an intriguing element, especially when I had received an amazingly erudite book called COMMUNITY in the same week<br />that I received UNKNOWN, and I could not help but draw some comparisons. When I had looked up the quote from Jim Morrison, I also found another Morrison quote that could quite<br />easily apply to the film unknown:\\" I believe in a long, prolonged, derangement of the senses in order to obtain the unknown.\\" Basically at least the first third of the film<br />could apply to this quote. I must admit that my interest in this film was from a promo where there was no indication of the central film story. The film TAKEN is, in my view,<br />what some may term a rock 'em sock 'em roller coaster ride, where the identities of each character are clearly defined, and you are essentially strapped in for an amazing<br />roller coaster ride that few films can emulate in the exact same way. UNKNOWN requires more thought, more intellect, in the approach that the audience should take with such a<br />potentially involving film. I suspect that this film may not be everyone's cup of tea, as some might say, since key characters evolve, develop, and, at least from my point of<br />view, raise many questions about the nature of who we are, what are our memories, and so on. It seemed Langella enjoyed this role, and got into the intricacies very much. So,<br />suspend the analytical, atleast while you watch the film, and I think you will have an unforgettable experience.

B009NQZVKG|4.0|I liked &#34;The Eye of God&#34; but it didn't seem as action packed as previous Sigma Force Novels. I was disappointed in that. It seemed to end too quickly without tying up some loose strings. I was awfully disappointed at the deaths of some characters, yet intrigued as well by their continuation. Good thought. I will still look forward to the next Sigma Force adventure.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|The pre-World War II Europe was a most fascinating time and place from a historian's point of view. The unresolved tensions remaining from the first World War, new tensions created as a result of it have been gradually building in Germany and surrounding countries. The people's perception of who they are as nations and nationalities became more astute due to a sizable amount of emigration that followed the events of the beginning of the century.<br /><br />The book starts with an unlikely, as it might appear to a modern reader, but quite commonplace at the time, courtship and consequent marriage of one Gretta Weissensteiner, from a relatively well-off working Jewish family and Wilhelm Winkelmeier, a German, whose family emigrated from Berlin to Bratislava, in a newly formed Czechoslovakia in 1931 following the Great Depression.<br /><br />Gretta's character is very likable--a lover of books, especially the \\"Romantics,\\" but the one who can appreciate almost anything well-written. She longs for connections with people who share her passion for books and with whom she can have an intelligent conversation. That was one of the reasons she was attracted to Wilhelm--he worked in a book store and was extremely well-read. He was also handsome, gently spoken, yet confident, and persistent.<br /><br />That seems like a match made in Heaven. Gretta's father also approved--his daughter has found a suitor she liked, who could hold a job, and, very important, was a pure-blood German. If she married him, she and her children would be safe from any possible prosecution in the future. Little he knew of the changes in the public minds that were to come.<br /><br />What follows is the historically accurate depiction of racism and antisemitism of that time. Jewish families, while not fully accepted, were still able to live and work rather successfully in the pre-war Western Europe. That, of course, changed drastically when Hitler and the Nazi party came to the power in Germany. The Jewish people became prosecuted, hunted down, and exterminated. This novel describes this escalation and its consequences. Great focus is brought to the subject by concentrating the narrative mostly on Weissensteiner and Winkelmeier families.<br /><br />What this book reminds us of, is that the \\"quiet\\" and \\"acceptable\\" racism, just like the veiled racism we can often see just by looking outside of the window, is NOT acceptable. All it takes is one crazy ideology or an opportunistic politician, and we could still relieve the horrors of concentration camps and mass graves. Still, this is not a political book. It's a human story, with love, betrayals, and hope. I don't want to give away the spoilers, so do pick up this book and read it. You won't be disappointed.sh people became prosecuted, hunted down, and exterminated. This novel describes this escalation and its consequences.

I was also raised in Texas and was 13 at the time of assassination of President Kennedy.  I have read everything I can on the assassination.  Stephen King's book accomplished everything I could want in a book.  Time travel, the ability to change history and insights into the assassination.  THIS IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!!!!!!!

1781162646|2.0|As a lover of all things Stephen King, I was really disappointed by this book. This book seems to be aimed more towards a younger crowd...high schoolers maybe? It reminded me of a Nancy Drew book or something that I would have read as a kid! Also, you have to read about 80% of the book before anything exciting or spooky even happens. This book is advertised as a horror/mystery about a ghost that haunts Joyland. However, it's more so about the stories and experiences that the main character, Devin, goes through while working as a theme park carnie. I don't see this one being made into a movie.

This album in my opinion is one of my faves its a different take on hip-hop but I'll take it.  I really haven't stopped playing this album along with Born Sinner by J Cole for the past few weeks.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|A lovely game. Very cute graphics,especially if you like the minion characters, with simple but addictive gameplay. Quirky music and fun! Should be a 5 star winner. BUT I have this on my Kindle and playing the game can also be quirky, but not so much fun! I have had the game shut down after playing the intro movie. I have had the game freeze after a level, when I should have gone back to the start menu. These glitches are frustrating, and have stopped me giving it the review it perhaps should have rated.

B006QPX7UI|4.0|\\"Gettysburg\\" is sort of a minor miracle, especially after comparing it with its snooze-fest prequel \\"Gods and Generals\\". this was a monumental undertaking, originally filmed as a TV miniseries, but released to theaters. The director and Ted Turner deserve kudos for bringing this story to fruition. A dedication to historical accuracy and use of actual locations, whenever possible, coupled with superb performances and a compelling script, keep your attention throughout its epic length. Sincere, hearfelt performances are the center of the film, and one comes to see the combatants as human beings, rather than distant historical figures.<br /><br />One minor quibble is the portrayal of Lee (well played by Martin Sheen) as the sole reason for the South's failure to win the battle. Almost nothing is made of Longstreet's failures on July 2, save for a single line of dialog where Lee pointedly tells Longstreet he doesn't understand why the day's attacks were not coordinated. Longstreet got his troops into action nearly five hours late (for reasons still debated by historians) allowing the Federals to reinforce their line. But this side of the battle is not featured in \\"Gettysburg\\". Instead the July 2 footage focuses almost exclusively on Little Round Top and Devil's Den.<br /><br />Throughout the film Longstreet is portrayed as the voice of reason, which he often was. But he deserves some blame for the defeat, because it was again his failure to get his men into position on July 3 that led Lee to scrap his original attack plan and drive on the Union center with Pickett's division. The film is accurate in depicting Longstreet's opposition to that charge, and to the whole battle in general.<br /><br />If you are a history buff, this film is not to be missed. If you are a Civil War buff, hold out for the Director's Cut, featuring more background and detail.
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|In almost a decade of buying music on Amazon, I have never written a review for anything, yet I feel compelled to discuss TDPDH.  I'll keep it brief, and start with an anecdote.  I don't follow AIC loyally and fervently, although I do own the Cantrell albums.  I was just browsing for new music one day, found and purchased this.  Let me say this:  if you grew up liking AIC, I would be very surprised if you don't like this album.  I'm a man in my mid 30s who grew up listening to AIC in high school, and this album immediately made me feel 20 years younger, and what's best, it's all new material, thus why I deem it a contemporary time capsule.  I liked Black Gives Way to Blue, but for some reason that I cannot explain, this album feels much more like the old AIC.  You could probably take every track on here and compare it to an old favorite.  I sincerely believe that if you have a similar AIC fan profile as I, that you will like this album.  It is *by far* my favorite new album of 2013.  It's new yet nostalgic.  Pretty magical stuff.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I really like this game!  It is challenging, quick and just works like I think a phone game should.  Very Addicting.<br /><br />Need more levels now!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I thouroghly enjoyed this game. Its like pac man with sharks with the fates of those less significant than your beast at the tips of your fingers.  Bad part if you dont buy gems or coins it takes forever to evolve.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Anytime I ask my 10 year old daughter what we want to watch?  Downton Abbey!!!  And, my husband loves it, too.  :)
B005HSL626|4.0|Turn off your mind and enjoy ripping apart fruits and see them paint the back wall in their own juices. Ahhh stress relief.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This album is such great example of electronics and instrumental music working together to achieve something great. I would recommend this 100%.
B00338QENI|4.0|Great book.  Good honest view of the characters.  Made me question everything I thought I knew about going to the doctor and &#34;discarding&#34; tissue.

B00B8PRDHE|1.0|nice dvd but ringo in uninspiring, sorry ringo, cant imagine not wanting to be out playing every song with all the great musicians
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|My only complaint is the ending but since I don't want to spoil it for anyone who has not yet watched it, I'll say no more. Besides, I'm in mourning....
B008LA7RM0|5.0|what can i say about the greatest album of all times, if it isnt in ur library shame on you !!!<br />go for it
0848812077|5.0|A very funny and engaging book. Besides Bukowski, this is the only author that made me laugh out loud. The characters range from pitiful and deranged to intelligent and clueless. Toole's masterful use of differing dialects make it unnecessary to use character quotes. Every person in this book is beautifully flawed in some way only to all come crashing together at the end. A great read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|. I really think this game is fun and cute  I wish I could get more gems quicker though. But over all its  fun
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|I have to say I was not sure what to expect when I bought this.  I love the special effects, very well done.  The plot twist was perfect.  The only thing I am left wondering is what happens to all the other \\"clones\\".  I mean if he's 49 and the other is 52 there are a lot of others running around.
B000TO0TCQ|5.0|Very interesting I love Alex rider books they are awesome a nd good<br /><br />It Is very very very very very epic
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Not a huge fan of this period, but the wife is.  She got me interested in the series and, I have to say, this season was the most powerful and touching, yet.
159514188X|1.0|I stopped reading after 265 pgs. This book dragged. I forced myself to finish reading it. I could have easily finished it, but i had enough of the Whining and her silly decisions. Clay annoyed me too... Just a horrible book for me...
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Our penal system is such a mess.  Why can't we provide real assistance to help people prepare for success after prison
B007MDB71O|5.0|Though this movie did poorly in the box office, it's an incredible movie.  I saw it 3 times in the theaters, and I love having it on Blu-Ray.  I grew up loving the books so much, and I felt like this movie did a good job of capturing the essence of the world.  I was a little disappointed with the main character, how he was written and depicted.  HOWEVER, the rest of the cast, particularly Lynn Collins as Deja Thoris and Willem Defoe as Tars Tarkas, was brilliant.  It was really an amazing movie, and I enjoy watching it every time.  :)  If you like the books, you will love the movie.  If you haven't read the books, I suggest watching the movie and deciding if Barsoom (Mars) is where you want to be!
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|As always Brown weaves an intriguing tale that blends science and faith. Unfortunately his very lengthy and overly descriptive verse punctuated with repetition and detailed back story was frustrating. I don't need every detail to enjoy or understand a story.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game it is very fun if you live in the city it's like have one in your back yard
B00063EMJ6|5.0|he's lasted so long.. moved so many people..<br />there's a bit of everything, almost, in this, for NY fans..I think he's done too much<br />over the years to compile a single CD representative.. but I guess we can say<br />the established hits are here.<br />There's more though.. and you should buy it.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|In line with his previous Sigma novels and my expectations this newest installment does not disappoint.  The characters introduced and developed in previous books are further defined and refined.  It is a good read and if you enjoy reading the exploits of the Sigma operatives it is worth your time.
B0002IQMKM|5.0|There isn't anything I disliked. I can pop this CD in the car, which I bought it for and play it all the way through.<br />Great tunes, great musicianship.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I don't know how Neil Gaiman turns a horror novel into a comforting book about childhood, but he did.  This is an enjoyable, brief novel (nearly a novella) with interesting creatures, people, and plot...I've never read anything quite like it.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Interesting way of presenting the story through different people's eyes.  The premise was okay - another post-apocalypse-type story with a different twist
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This was an interesting take on Jesus at a historical figure and addresses the social, economic, and political context in which Jesus lived.  At times, it was a bit tedious, due to the descriptions of the rise and fall of various Roman and Jewish leaders and related movements but that's to be expected of a historical piece.  While I'm not sure that this is the only interpretation of Jesus as a historical figure, it certainly was an interesting one.
B0094M2ODQ|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES, LOVE THE STORY, MUSIC AND LOVE BARBRA. SO GLAD IT IS IN BLUE RAY FINALLY.
B00BY8DNK6|5.0|AWESOME SHOW! DIO WASTHE BEST SINGER OF HARD ROCK AND HEAVY METAL! RIP RONNIE...HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SHOW FOR ALLTHE DIO FANS OUT THERE
B007B6VOG0|4.0|This group reminds me of music I listened to back in the day. The music just makes you wanna sing along and dance to it. :)
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Nice little app BUT IT WILL NOT SHOW A SAMPLE OF THE ALERT!!!!!!! NOW IF YOU WOULD LIKE A GOOD GAME THAT IS BETTER THAN THIS THEN I WOULD RECCOMEND THE 99 DOLLAR GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00947N6D8|4.0|I liked it but expected more. I'm not really sure why but I did. It is done well and the animation is wonderful...
B009NY43NY|1.0|So very dissatisfied with this ending.  The other 1 star reviews have summed up my feelings quite well.  Therefore, I will not repeat what others have put so well. But, I will state this:  Ms. Charlaine Harris- I understand that these characters are yours to write however you please--with that being said, this series would not have continued without the fans purchasing your books and making it a success. I really wish you would have listened to said fans on what THEY wanted.  Speaking as one of those fans who supported you the whole way- I am grossly disappointed.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|This movie is for kids and adults alike. There is some mild adult humor but otherwise it's laugh out loud funny. Truly enjoy it :)
B0058W74UY|4.0|So far, so good.  No complaints.  My daughter hooked me up and it is working very well.<br />Highly recommend the product.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|All ages can enjoy this app. It is definately one of my favorites. I can't  wait to see the next levels to come. Great app try it out, you won't  be disappointed.
0380725398|5.0|I bought this to read prior to a trip to Devon and Cornwall during which we stayed for a few days at the &#34;real&#34; Jamaica Inn, upon which this classic novel and the movie were based.  A wonderful can't-put-it-down story, and the actual Jamaica Inn in Cornwall, of course, milks this book for all it's worth.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I had issues with the game loading and opening at first but now it works just fine. Graphics are awesome.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|I admit I was somewhat skeptical in sitting down to watch this film because of the various unfavorable reviews I had read.  Well - fuhgeddaboudem!  This is NOT a remake of the original movie from 30+ years ago - this is an ultra-modern version of the basic theme of that film, and it succeeds superbly.  It's very rare that a horror movie carries me from the first scene to the last with such a powerful, relentless and unstoppable feeling of accelerating dread and doom.  (\\"The Exorcist\\" is the benchmark for me in this regard.)  But this film did it for me, and because of so many factors, not least of which is the musical score - a brilliant synthesis of different styles and techniques that it can virtually stand alone as an hommage to the horror genre.  The cast is uniformly excellent, the cinematography is astounding, the production values are first-rate and the director obviously had a clear vision of what he wanted to achieve - namely, to scare the living crap out of us - and he does a fantastic job!  A must-see for all horror fans.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This movie is very well done, has cute characters, is a great movie for family viewing and delivers a good message that is well understood by children of all ages on up through adulthood. We all loved it.
B000I8G5B2|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time. I could watch it everyday for the rest of my life and not get bored of it. It is such a smart story and never talks down to the viewer.<br /><br />The music is also my favorite soundtrack of any movie. Michael Nyman did an amazing job with it. It is inspirational yet haunting, especially the track called &#34;The Other Side&#34; which plays during the final swim scene.<br /><br />A lot of people that I know think this movie is about genetics but I couldn't disagree more. I feel that genetics was just the vehicle for the main point which is that working hard will always be better than natural ability. It's really motivational to think about and this movie portrays it the best that I've ever seen.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love it it's awesome and I can't wait for shark week see it August 4<br />2013 it will be awesome
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I love this set od dvds. They are a great buy! I would like to say I would recommend these to everyone who loves the show.
1582701709|5.0|I just got this one in the mail today, but the same person told me about this book too, and from what they shared with me, I can also tell that I will love it too. I'm so sorry but I forgot to add how happy I was about the prices of the books. The condition that they are in are really great for the cost. Yes, I am very well pleased with the service, and also the interval from the time I place the orders to the time I receive the products are wonderful. The wait is not long at all. Thanks again.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Well thought out show. Love the characters and the storie line. A bit predictable but keeps me coming back for more.
B0086213XW|4.0|Surprising movie with rich depiction of the reality of relationships.... forcing consideration of how women show up in relationships expecting the man to make their life have meaning.  Pace fit the topic.  Great ending!
B000MV9026|3.0|I bought the movie for my 4 year old and she loves it.  It isn't one that I am glued to when it's on, but it's fun to watch her dance around when it's on.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This Bingo game is fun to play - you get to start off with playing peeps in NYC. You can chat if you're good enough to chat and play Bingo. I started off with 1 card then 2 then up to 4 which made me crazy LOL - I am sure I got a few bingo's and didn't catch it because I got behind. So, it doesn't really go too fast it's that I'm too slow. I can handle 3 cards and did win a couple of bingo's. Then it popped up a slot game and I played it for a while then realized it was taking all my Bingo coins so I stopped. Went back to playing bingo and then ran out of coins. It then popped up telling me I could BUY some coins with REAL money! NOPE - so sorry not going to do that. So I have to wait for a 24 hour period to play again. They give you some coins daily. I'll stick to that. It's fun if you have some time to play.
B000SW4DV2|5.0|I bought this movie at the request of the 4 year old, but find myself cracking up to the subdued adult jokes that I hear throughout the movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game. It's challenging enough to keep me interested but not frustratingly difficult. I look forward to new levels.
B0055S348W|4.0|A little complicated to connect to printer.  However You have to really read the printer instructions AND the app instructions online.  Otherwise it works great, and quick when hooked up for wireless printer.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|Yes, I am a RODE-IE!  This is a fantastic mic.  I am not an audio pro by any means, use this with my hi-def handy cam and the sound quality is stunning to my amateur ears.  I listen to a lot of podcasts so from that I have high expectations of good, clean, clear audio and this delivers.  I would buy again and again and again.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|...and I got to share them with my two boys ages 6 and 7, who loved watching Indy figure his way out of the predicaments he frequently found himself in.<br /><br />My wife, who dislikes virtually every aspect of the eighties, enjoyed these films; she was, however, critical of the last film's alien premise, complaining it didn't fit well with the preceding offerings. Millennials...(!)<br /><br />Overall a great set to own and feel nostalgic about a bygone era in filmmaking.
B004T0E2S8|4.0|the only reason I'm giving this app 4 stars is cuz i usually have to open it twice because it crashes.
B00BC5I6Q2|4.0|Move over, J.R. Ewing...you have a rival for \\"the man we most love to hate.\\"  This one is badder and smarter than even J.R.  Not as rich maybe but playing for much bigger stakes.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey is every bit as good as Larry Hagman was in creating this indelible character.  I still don't know what it is about either J.R. or Frank Underwood that is particularly likable, but I did find myself rooting for Frank at times in spite of his very bad behavior.  Maybe it's the way he lets us, the audience. into his real thoughts by his asides into the camera, maybe it's his amazing ability to save himself in , Superman-like, in crisis after crisis.  Maybe it's his Southern accent, which reminds me of Tennessee Williams in his sad later years, although I have much more affection for TW than I ever could for Frank.  Maybe it's his sheer maliciousness, his willingness to do things that many of us would like to do but don't dare.  I loved the scene in the woods where's he's been dragged by the billionaire birding enthusiast---the looks of exasperation on his face are pricelss as the rich old guy regales him with bird lore and then recites  lines from \\"When Lilacs Last at the Dooryard Bloomed\\" by Walt Whitman to him and asks Frank if he knows the poem.  Frank, claims he doesn't  and then rushes to the screen and snarls at us that he knows the damned poem!  Somehow I found that very endearing.  Likewise his argument with God which ended in his blowing out all the votive candles in the church!  Very moving, very  funny.<br /><br />Robin Wright is lovely to look at as his wife, Claire.  I didn't find the character very credible...the contrast between her tender moments with Russo's children and her cold-heartedness, seemed like too much of a stretch.  Wright plays sweet and tender better than cold; that would have been more suited to Glen Close. But Wright is more beautiful and eye candy is one thing that this series dishes out by the handfuls.  The whole cast is pretty good.At first I didn't care for the actress who played Zoe, the reporter/girlfriend, but she grew on me.  She has a vulnerability as well as a fierce determination to succeed that makes her an interesting and somewhat likable character, not to mention her willingness to take off her clothes.  There's a lot of that and some viewers may object.  I don't think it's any worse than what goes on in most films these days but it is clearly a device to keep viewers interested. It's a way that the film makers manipulate the viewers just as the young women in the film manipulate their various contacts. There is some hypocrisy, probably intended, that the girl reporters who sleep around for their careers seem to see themselves as superior to the girls who live in trailers and do it for cash but it all amounts to the same thing.<br /><br />The marriage/alliance of Frank and Claire is interesting.  Another reviewer has likened it to the Clintons and this comparison is certainly apt.  Each one \\"allows\\" the infidelities of the other, but, Claire asks, \\"What does she bring us?\\"  Infidelity for its own sake is apparently not ok in her book, only if it furthers \\"their\\" position.  Claire has her own choice between her \\"heart\\" and what she has built together with Francis and we see what she chooses.  I could comment on parallels with other public figures today but I'll let that go.<br /><br />So the content of the series is certainly realistic.  One can only speculate about what new wrinkles will appear in the next season....electronic surveillance...whistle-blowers...men who tweet?  As much as I can cluck my tongue over some of the cheesier aspects of this series, I'll probably be watching it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a very engaging story.  A page turner to the very last page. Don't miss this one or you'll be sorry
B00B2166BS|5.0|This product does what it says. It takes a huge amount of time of to charge my Nexus 10. Less than half the time of the usb cable and wall charger included with the tablet. It only connects one way, so you don't have to worry about inserting it in the wrong way. A good buy if you have the Nexus 10...
B0081336FO|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch performs this part with wit, innocence, absolute egotism and just enough charm to make you fall in love with the character.  Can't wait for more Sherlock!
B00942S4OY|5.0|I love this album. After I got the first album I was very excited for the second one and I was not let down when I first listened to it.
B005BGBPBG|3.0|Actress from Once Upon a Time is the best reason to watch, Jim Halpert isn't bad either, but Kate Hudson's character is soooo annoying.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|It's funny that people still call this a remake when there isnt even an Ash character and different story.  Yes, boo hoo there was no Bruce Campbell.  Get over it!  It was still a great gory tasteful horror movie!  The raining blood chainsaw scene was classic, the opening was a great starting scene, nailgun!, arm chop and fall, miya in the basement slicing the toungue makeout scene, puking scene... it's all i ask for in a horror.  While most horror movies haven't stepped up to the definition of horror over the past 15-20 years, this film defines that!  It's about time somebody stepped up, and I'm glad it was a new installment of one of my favorite classics growing up.<br /><br />Just saying if they make a sequel, don't drop the ball like most sequels.
B005C0DHEY|4.0|Get educated, don't swallow the line about how natural gas is better for the world, better for the US. Watch this documentary and see how bad its effects are on regular Americans.
B00CMKPNBC|5.0|Another great album from Zaz. She is famous in France and all over Europe but just starting to edge her way into the US market.<br />My wife and I can't get enough.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I was so happy to find this app while staying with my mom for a few days. I have always needed background noise in order to sleep and this provides so many different noises to choose from. It also has a timer and alarm clock .
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 1 got me hooked, Season 2 was okay but I loved Season 3. Not that I loved everything that happened...some of it still gives me goosebumps.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I use google for everything i search for, i have no complaints. Its easy to use and always finds what i need.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|I loved &#34;Hot Fuzz&#34; when I first saw it, and it's even better with each subsequent viewing. I think Pegg and company are some of the best &#34;new&#34; moviemakers to come along in ages. Strongly recommended!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I have never been a huge facebook user but do enjoy looking at pictures my friends post. Easy way to keep in touch.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show can't turn it off! Definitely recommend everyone to watch suits. Drama, mixed with comedy and suspense. Can't wait for season 3 to start!
B006Y5H74W|5.0|It's a shame NBC cancelled this show. It was one of the best on tv.  Beats the reality shows hands down.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I found Downton Abbey on Amazon Prime after hearing about it from a few friends. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much even though I'm a fan of British TV. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find I was completely sucked in within the first half hour.<br />The story is very well written, and develops the characters so well that you find yourself thinking about them hours after you've turned the TV off.<br />I was so enthralled in this world that I spent a few sleepless night tearing through all 3 Seasons in a matter of days. Unwilling to abandon the world of Downton Abbey again, I immediately held a marathon viewing of all 3 seasons again. This now rates as one of my all time favorite shows and one that I'll watch over and again.
B005544V6A|5.0|I really enjoy this show - the characters are immediately likeable and the actors fill the roles very naturally. Not the same old Law Firm show.
B00BI5J9BC|5.0|OK, SO I was really hesitant to watch this for a long time. I am a huge fan of the &#34;classical&#34; version of Les Mis and was a bit bothered by superstars performing the musical. Honestly it was so much better than I ever expected. Hugh Jackman is incredible, and although Russell Crow is not quite so incredible musically, he was quite good. It brought more life to the musical for me, seeing everything up close, and I found all the acting to be very good. Some liberties were taken with the music; obviously not ALL music could be included, and the actors had some leway in how they interpreted pieces, I think. Very well done in my opinion :)
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have been shopping for a tablet for several months.  I considered the kindle fire hd but ended up going with the Samsung galaxy 7 inch because it offered some versatility that I was looking for over other tablet brands.  The biggest factor in my search was being able to have my kindle capability.  Even though Samsung has their own version of a book app, I continually use my kindle on android app.I'm loving my tablet and I'm loving reading my books on it.  The ease of purchasing is so heloful too.
B0092D1V5Y|2.0|PW Hack SW is supposed to work! I coughs up passwords, but they don't work.  I even  tried it on my own wifi system at home....No Luck....  But it's certainly worth the price.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Keeps me hooked and makes 40 minutes on the treadmill fly by !  I'm almost thru season 2 and its great also.
B00BLGZUR0|3.0|Good war movie if you like war movies good acting.It depicted how things where in thoughs time an era ww2.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|It was a really good book I liked it I've read It ovar 7 times so it was a good book
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|The first thing I have to say about this game is how fantastic  the graphics are -  some of the best I've ever seen in a mobile game! Once  you get done marveling over  the graphics,  there's a really fun game waiting to be played. Simple  but engaging,  perfect for young gamers as well as platform  veterans.
B005IQ39AY|1.0|Until recently, I would have given this app 5 stars for being an enjoyable time passer. It has become  glitchy and almost unplayable. At some point in almost every game a small ball appears and ends the game, no matter how many balls you have amassed. Sometimes it keeps feeding shooter balls after the board is cleared and won't let you out. So sad.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|It was a great story about a southern plantation with a twist of a young orphaned Irish immigrant.  The developing story between the Irish girl and the slaves was wonderful and heart wrenching.
1452126577|5.0|This book is a lighthearted, fun romp through the mind of my favorite internet cat. It's not meant to be taken seriously and flipping through it brings a complete smile to my face. I am a complete fan of Tardcat though and could not be happier to have this sitting on my bookshelf.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|best book ever  i think every one can relate to this book at one point in life i give this book 5
B000FC1KBG|3.0|Some interesting ideas in the book, but I cannot stand the way it is written. I felt like I was being talked down to while reading and I hated that she called the reader &#34;love.&#34;  It was obnoxious.  I actually read about this in the comments before buying the book and wish I would have paid attention.  If that kind of talk annoys you, then avoid this book.<br /><br />Otherwise, it had some decent suggestions.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|Like calender, very much, place important  appointments on dates, stay placed even when Kindle is off. Love having the date and time on kindle for planning activities. Very easy to use.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Excellent writing and suspense.  I look forward to reading the third book in the series.  Can't wait too see the film too.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Received the sharpener this AM.  Opened the box and tried touching up my pocket knife with the ceramic inserts.  It actually made the knife duller.  In fairness I must say the knife was very sharp as I had just stropped the blade the day before.  I have a few old pocket knives around the house I will try the sharpener on later.<br /><br />I think the problem is the angle that the carbide and ceramic inserts are set at are too bluff.  Would be perfect angle for sharpening an axe however.  It is a well made item though,
B005PK57IK|5.0|It is a good show. Fast moving and very interesting. .Gets better every season -- glad it is available on Prime!
B001S2PT3M|5.0|I am a true fan from the begining and I am just wondering if it comes with Spanish Subtitles, anyone can help me?<br /><br />Regards
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love the game it is a challenge a though I would some times want a hit but it is still fun
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game was so good but after a while it stopped working so now i am deleting it and getting it agian.
075669812X|5.0|I purchased this for my 3 year old because he is a diehard Ninjago fan.  I hear the names Kai, Lord Garmadon, Sensei Wu, and The Green Ninja more than my own.  ;)  He can't read yet but adores it for all the pictures in it.  Even if your child can't read yet, they will love this book.  I paid $9 on here for it, but in the stores I saw it selling for over $20, so this is a deal!
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|My free version on kindle doesn't work right. I don't have the diamonds on the top of screen. Works fine on my droid?
1449410243|5.0|This book is hilarious, but it will only take you 20 minutes to read it.  I loved it, but just wish it was longer.  You cannot be offended easily if you are going to read this :)  It jokes about everything from death to gay people, so be prepared!
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|Thor is a great movie especially in 3D.  New technology allows us to see 3D at home exactly the same as in the theater.  I have Iron Man and the Avengers but didn't know about Thor which appears in the Avengers.  We enjoyed seeing the background of why Thor was on Earth.  If you watch the Avengers but haven't watched Thor I highly recommend that you do.
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|Predictable, poor acting, humor was weak at best, basically felt like a made for TV movie based on the DC sniper.
B007NZQU72|5.0|This book helped me understand and appreciate pieces of my personality that at one time used to bother me. It was easy to read with few technical words and I read through it rather quickly.
0307120007|4.0|This year for Easter, my little boy got a basket of books. He also received some small stuffed animals and a little chocolate, but mostly he got books. He loved it. And he loved this book to pieces, literally. In fact, after I write this review I will have to try to mend the book.<br /><br />I bought this book for his Easter basket because it was on the South Carolina Libraries list of 100 Picture Books for Toddlers. I did not own this book as a child and my mom won't admit to owning a copy. Before I purchased the book, I read some scathing reviews, so I was hesitant, but I figured with a matching rabbit I couldn't go too far wrong.<br /><br />I should say, as if you don't already know, my son at two-and-a-half is a toddler and probably the exact market for whom this book is written. And he loves it! He would not put it down, except reluctantly for bath-time for a week. I can't tell you exactly what he loves so much about it because he seems to enjoy every page. This book appeals to all his sense (alas, even taste) in every sense.<br /><br />If I am lacking in supplies and skill to mend this particular copy, I will be looking for another, hardier version, because he really wants this book back.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Greart game.  Killing my battery though. Can't stop racing. My kids keep stealing my phone to play.  Endless fun. l
B007V4530A|4.0|This is a great book for anyone aspiring to be a better public speaker. Contains sound practical advice. Highly recommended.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This book is a mix of from several genres - I shudder at the thought of putting it into a pigeonhole. An aimless bookstore clerk working nights in a shabby bookstore pays attention to the enigmatic procedures and finds a mystery that has him scouring old buildings, history,bookshelves, type fonts, and the Internet. The protagonist brings his eclectic mix of friends (and the reader) along on a very unusual quest.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I never got a chance to see the pilot of this TV show and now enjoying the whole season!  I'm hooked...

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Someone recommeded I watch the series.  I did not think I was going to like it but went ahead and started watching it.  I got hooked. Just love the series. Can't wait until I can start watching the next season.
B000U618C8|5.0|Perfect for background music while entertaining.  He kept coming up on Pandora.com and I couldn't resist! Ready for the next album.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|The opening scenes got my attention and the music brought me into the right mood.  Let the conniving and deals begin.<br />Actors nailed their role and I liked how, through the use of the camera, I was made to feel like I was in on action.
B007V6PTNY|5.0|This album, along with the Getz-Gilberto &#34;The Girl From Ipanema&#34; album, was my intro to Brazilian jazz in the early 1960's courtesy of my aunt and uncle, and I not only became an instant fan but it was a valuable assist in my learning Latin percussion, piano, guitar, sax and bass. I bought this one for framing, and it is in like-new condition. Everyone should have this along with the other Glberto-Jobim-Getz albums, as well as Paul Desmond's &#34;Bossa Antigua&#34; and Cal Tjader's &#34;San Francisco Moods&#34; featuring guitarist Eddie Duran.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was actually pretty fun. I liked it. Now that I am finished I would like to fine another. Went quick!
B00CW665VI|3.0|Well here is the thing, my boss recommended this book to me, and so I of course read it. I was intrigued at first and interested. The writing style of Emma Chase is so comedic and easy going, it doesn't take long to get into the story line and actually begin wanting more...and then it swims up next to you - you know, the shark she jumps - and it is a struggle from that point forward. I would say it is predictable, but that would be wrapping it in a cloak of Sydney Sheldon and it really isn’t that bad; however, He meets the girl in the bar, automatically you know it is her...everything is so cliché it steps on the stones of boring much too early in the narrative. The writing style never wavers, but what he says and what she says are falling off my tongue and rolling over my lips before the characters get a chance to entertain. I wonder if the story would have played differently had she not used the framing format in the writing. Had the book begun with the chance meeting at the bar...the meeting would have been somewhat of a mystery...but instead, you have a reader who knows what is going to happen except a bit fuzzy on how it will happen...this is when the cliché dialogue and inner conversations mess it up. Everything is turned over to the reader right up front, so therefore the outcome is simple and straight forward where anyone reading can get the feel for what is going to happen. I enjoyed reading it right up until the 8 -10 th chapters and then it became tedious and uninteresting. I am not sure I will read any more of the books in the series. My suggestion the Emma is - make it simple...write the story start to finish and leave some of the detail aside in order that the readers will not get bored.  The reader doesn't need all the feelings up front and each characters full perspective on the other so quickly. Allow them to grow and unfold as the story progresses this way when they finally do kiss or have great sex or anything else it is a surprise to the reader or at the very least less predictable. I liked it for an easy read, but I could ahve written it myself from the information provided in the first two chapters.
B00BXZ3D6Y|5.0|I'm really glad that I downloaded this app. I really Love the interface. You won't be disappointed with this purchase.

B00DMM3WVM|5.0|Great game, very addictive, good graphics, and coins are easy to get. I highly recommend this game, and I don't know why it's not more popular.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Great game play and graphics. Addictive and fun. Definitely worth the buy. Unlike most other defender type games I enjoyed playing through and enjoyed the story.

B004SBX112|1.0|As you may notice, the title doesn't let you know until after you purchase that it is for Android.  Maybe I should just pay better attention and not get pulled into something that isn't in large print.  I paid for nothing.  Can't load on my kindle and I don't have android
B008MM9630|5.0|This app makes my imaginations go wild It is so much fun and cool. I could play on it all day.
B00DHNJCKQ|5.0|Colin Farrell was great. The story was compelling, though there were a few loose ends. I would recommend this for a good ride.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent character development and their believable transformation over time are the earmarks of a well planned series that holds ones interest.  Perhaps the sole detractor is the use of many parallel plot lines which, although well integrated, can cause the time between the exit and subsequent return to a plot line to leave one unsure of where things stand for that segment.  That is however a nit, which is why I leave the rating as excellent.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Just could not figure out what was going on . And Halle Berry with Tom Hanks is an unbelievable match with no chemistry.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|First off, it was extremely easy to set up right out of the box! I plugged it into an HDMI slot in my Pioneer A/V receiver, plugged the USB into the receiver as well, and then switched to the correct input. There is a setup wizard on the screen that will guide you through setup in very few steps. After it was setup, you are good to go. I instantly cast a youtube video in 1080p, and tried out some music as well. There are a couple downsides so far based on my setup but nothing I didn't expect when I bought it.<br /><br />1. It does not automatically switch inputs if you are using a receiver. It only works that way if you plug it into a TV. This is based only on my experience. Perhaps different receivers behave differently. I use a Pioneer VSX-919AH-K ([[ASIN:B001UA6OLS B001UA6OLS]]<br /><br />2. This is a toss up depending on how good your wireless speed is, but I wanted to see if I could stream amazon prime videos in HD. Because it isn't pulling the movie from the cloud, you are using up most of your bandwidth on the HD stream from your computer/laptop. This caused lots of skipping, and loss of quality since there was less bandwidth for the chromecast to eat up.<br /><br />Overall based on my limited usage, I'm very happy with how it is working. Its been seamless between both my phone and computer. If I have anything else worthwhile to inform you about, I'll update my review. Feel free to ask questions and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I really loved the books and loved the first movie. The great think about the movie is that it doesn't stray far from the book<br />like many other movies, IE, The Twilight Series.

B00CAJMGDI|5.0|If you don't listen to this album at least 100 times after buying it, Lindsey will give you your money back.  OK, not really, but you probably really will listen to the album at least 100 times.  Lindsey's sound is fresh, different, invigorating, and irresistible.  Classical violin + dubstep + techno + hip-hop = awesome.  Enjoy.<br /><br />Lindsey, congrats on making it to Amazon's top 25 best-selling albums of 2013.  You're going places, girl!
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|Great Movie. Didn't &#34;suck&#34; me in like other movies with Sean Penn, but still very view worthy. Have fun watching it.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|I found the results very interesting and I think the approach is ideal.  Wish I had done this 30 years ago.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|This was a compelling story  Makes you realize how life could have been in Afghanistan. Wonderful characters vividly described. Thought provoking
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I flip flopped on buying this book for a while, then bought it because it was on sale at Target.<br />World War Z was not what I expected, it was more a collection of short stories. Each chapter is a different persons tale of what happened during the zombie war. The stories were intense. For me they read just like real tales of war, violent, gruesome and highly emotional. Mr Brooks' world building was amazing, he created, or perhaps rebuilt a world, after a global catastrophe. The stories span from China to the US and many countries in between. Each was about the terrifying ordeal of the dead returning to feast on the living. Some stories were military and some from citizens, yet all were riveting.<br />I liked the wide range of tales given not only views from the army facing down the enemies, but also how Joe Shmoe dealt with their loved ones coming back. I found one of the last stories to be the most fascinating. I takes place in the ocean where the zombies are still trudging across the bottom and the interviewer is in the sub and sees what the undersea workers are dealing with. I thought that was really cool.<br />I do need to say, while I really enjoyed the book I don't think it was worth all the hype. It is kind of original in it's delivery, but not so much the zombie \\"genre\\".
0061808121|5.0|This time the critics and I agree: To Kill A Mockingbird is a great audiobook.  I'm sure you've all read this one by now, right?  If you haven't, you need to drop what you're doing and go read it right now.  Like many others, I first read To Kill a Mockingbird in high school.  I vaguely remember enjoying the story back then but I was at an age where I didn't really appreciate books the way I do now.  I am now proud to have a copy in my own personal library and was pleased to find this audio edition at my local library.  This is the kind of book you can enjoy again and again.<br /><br />Every time I pick up To Kill a Mockingbird again, it's like coming home to family.  I sympathize with Atticus Finch, a single father, who struggles to bring up his children in a world full of hatred and prejudice.  I look on as a proud father as Jem strives to become the kind of man his father is.  I can only shake my head and laugh at the antics of Scout.  And my heart leaps for joy every time Boo Radley comes to the rescue.  Harper Lee's amazing characters are as alive today as they were 50 years ago.<br /><br />Written in 1960, To Kill A Mockingbird discusses many topics that are as valuable to us today as they were fifty years ago, and I'm not just talking about racism here, I'm talking about basic human dignity: having respect for yourself and for others.  What I like most about Harper Lee's classic is the intimate snapshot it gives us of life in the post-depression era south.  Not the kind of stuff you'd find in a history book, but the actual daily lives of the people.  Harper Lee captured it beautifully.<br /><br />To Kill A Mockingbird won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1961, and is still part of the curriculum in many schools, as it was in my own.<br /><br />I can't imagine a better voice for Scout Finch than Sissy Spacek.  Spacek's mild southern accent fits the audiobook very well, naturally, since the story takes place in the south.  Also, Scout Finch can be rather sassy at times, and Sissy Spacek portrayed the part very well.  If you want to hear more audiobooks narrated by Sissy Spacek, check out Stephen King's Carrie.<br /><br />If you went to school anytime in the last fifty years, you've probably already read To Kill A Mockingbird.  Just in case you haven't, you really need to.  Pick up a copy today, or borrow one from a friend.at times, and Sissy Spacek portrayed the part very well.

0425267695|5.0|To be honest, I have not picked up and read a fantasy like this (swords and sorcery) in over 20 years. On the strength of the reviews and the fact that I love a good coming of age story, I picked this up. And then powered through it! It was amazing. Character development was outstanding, the story flow was great, and as any good story should, completely sucked me in. When oh when will the second book be published??!!??
B003E48AYC|1.0|The blu-ray worked but the dvd and digital copy did not.The dvd had bemish and did not want to play.The digital copy did not have the code to activate it.So i had to send it back.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|A book made of short and clever stories about how a zombie apocalypse would affect the whole world. I was surprised to find out that it considers the psychological, economic, political and social repercussions an event like this will carry. It’s clear that the book has a lot of research behind.<br />This work will be found fun and entertaining not only to all the sci-fi lovers, but to everyone. It’s not as grotesque as anyone could imagine, considering its zombie thematic.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I use to love the app but you changed it earlier this month and it is so hard to move around the site. I would have given you s 5 before that.
B000HL09MG|5.0|This is a terrific movie in that it exposes an element of society that most people are unaware exists.  The exceptional atmosphere that is created by the fantastic imagery, cinematic display, and unfolding storyline creates powerful and lasting feelings of love, friendship, shock, horror, and sadness.  I wish it would have lasted longer!
0345529057|5.0|I'm only on the second book of the 4 book set I bought (A Clash of Kings). I'm not reviewing over the first two books, but in general, the writing is great, good detail, and I like the set up of each character getting a chapter. I think it helps you get to know who the characters are and how they play into the story as a whole. For me, because of the detail and complex nature of the books, I found it to be a rather slow read, it took me about a month to read the first book (A game of Thrones) while reading a couple hours at a time, several times a week. Still the story is fantastic and keeps you wanting to go to bed later to read some more because it is rather fascinating. It's not a story that seems to have a lot of happy endings, but it's just a great story and would recommend it to anyone!
B00D4FDNIO|4.0|I really hadn't heard this album before purchasing, but it turns out to be one of my faves for the summer.  These boys have a knack for production and anyone that appreciates 90s electronic music with a modern flair will enjoy it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is an excellent product and yes trust me I would definitely recommend this to anyone.  If you're interested please choose it.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The second season is just as good as the first. The recurring characters give the show depth.  The show also gains a sense of humor in the second season.

0071762345|5.0|Likable Social Media was recommended reading for a Master's level course in Viral Marketing I recently took. It was a great read. Easy to understand, casual reading, informative for the beginners in social media. I've already implemented some of his direction and seen the financial rewards. Definitely a good buy!
193700788X|3.0|its not a bad book in general but if you compare it with the previous books its a frustration. ending is not satisfying, everything is left open actually so not much of an ending there. story was boring at some points and also confusing when lots of different stuff was happening at the same time. it felt as though Charlaine Harris was not yet ready to end the story and she got so much on her mind that she squeezed everything inside this as a all together mess. i expected so much more so i was frustrated. well as a result: 'dont get your hopes up!'

B005ELZNH0|5.0|If you are already a fan of Miles then you already know pretty much what you are getting. If you are a new commer, this is a great place to start. For starters the price you can not haggle about. $35 for twenty cd's! They are packaged to look like mini lp's which looks cool. While everyone has thier favorites and some will banter why it may not be included in this set, overall it is a very good spread of his career. A few of them have bonus tracks even. Very highly recomended.
B000PMG16U|1.0|I could not say it better than Lucas on the \\"Making of\\" documentary for Episode I called \\"The Beginning\\" near the end he says, \\"You can destroy these things, It is possible.\\"  Very True.  The Prequel Trilogy would have been better served on Cartoon Network. The HD conversion looks nice, kind of like a gold ring in a pigs snout.  I know longer watch any of the Star Wars movies and don't care one bit about Episode VII.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|It is the replace/spare for the original with a original, nothing more, nothing less. perfect for good price. I need it to replace the one the came with my 18-55 DX, it was a real cheap one.
B004G5ZY7E|2.0|No one thought much of this book.  Hard to follow characters and their names made it even more difficult.  Several of the group didn't even finish it.

B0028RXXE8|5.0|This is an awesome series. It is factual and action packed . The actors and extra's did an amazing job and endured many hardships to make this series one of the best ever made.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|The book really started off great. I've bought plenty of business , self-help, or human nature type books before. This one came at a great time as I'm trying to gain some more self discipline. I really enjoyed the first couple of chapters , even started working toward some goals that are long overdue. That's where the 3 stars where earned. It got me personally motivated which is what I was looking for. The reason it only got 3 stars is because half way through I started to realize the author is going on and on and on and on with story after story about how some company or individual capitalized on human habit. I would of liked a lot more how and lot less who. I don't mind Tony Dungi but If I intended to read his book I would of bought it. I still appreciate the book but along with giving it no more than 3 stars , I'll also be starting the other book I purchased on the topic before finishing this one.
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|Such a nice album full of catchy songs. I really doubt there's a single song on here I don't like.

B007URVZJ6|4.0|This was a real quick read that provides guidance on how to prep your ebook.  It not only provides formatting tips and instructions, but also covers the elements (title page, copyright, table of contents, dedication, preface) that you would normally put in an ebook.<br /><br />If you're thinking about self publishing, the earlier you read this book, the better.  You don't want to have to reformat things later, especially inserting images.

Excellent! 5 star! Totally recommend!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|A real cute movie that is suitable for adults and kids.  While there's a lot of animations that are &#34;for kids&#34;, but contain a lot of violence and adult jokes, this is not one of them.  The humor is something that will make the adults laugh without kids later asking, &#34;What did they mean when they said...?&#34;  Even though it involves villains and heroes, it's not a violent movie.  The most violent it gets is a little gun that freezes people into a chunk of ice.  And of course those little yellow minions are adorable.
B00D8OHPF8|4.0|Who says Joe is weak? R&B can't get any better with the bedroom music of Joe. Joe does not disappoint, ask your lady.
B000JIN3J8|4.0|Probably the version I most enjoyed and closest to the book.  Not as lush as the 90's version but worth the time.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Diamond Dash is a fast paced colorful and fun. It is so easy to learn.<br /><br />There are many rewards to keep the game exciting.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|The movie has the right balance of action, subtle humor and plot twists to keep you engaged.  Unlike a lot of adaptations, I am eager to read the book now.
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|was hard to download to phone, harder to have limited space in phone. the legend games are fun an landd as addicting as candy
B00DYEN5QU|1.0|I hate any bluray that is ultraviolet instead of digital copy.  I like being able to put it on my iPad or laptop.  I have not and will not buy any movie that is ultraviolet without digital copy.
B003E74B24|5.0|I would totally recommend this book. I think everyone should own a copy.  I will tell all of my friends about this book.
0743497465|5.0|I originally bought this book for my husband, who passed it along to me since he enjoyed it so much. It is a great, quick read. Highly recommend!
B005HEK3JW|5.0|A truly wonderful and amazingly imaginative show with tons of great acting<br />And drama. It begs the question, was  the author an alien stranded here<br />On Earth?
B00CXQL828|5.0|This album is really fantastic.<br /><br />Its got balls, its got technical skill and its got heart. The songs are pretty catchy and very well diversified, with all out rocking songs like Six Feet Deeper and Elevate, to beautiful and passionate songs like The Dying and Regret. Richie's voice and guitar work are phenomenal. Billy's base work is amazing as always and MP is a master of his craft.<br /><br />I'm no Angel is my personal favorite track and will make for one hell of a single.<br /><br />I had some very high exceptions for this debut and those expectations have been exceeded. Whether you like Rock, blues or even prog, this is an album well worth picking up.<br /><br />Now all that's left is to see them live.
B002PZC8BM|5.0|A wonderful cast centered around the complicated and intriguing character of Patrick Jane.  Many of the episodes I am watching for the second or third time.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|this game is amazing it keeps my daugther entertained for a while and I somethimes have to help her and this game is amazing
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Why change it when it was so successful?  Don't bother us with &quot;points&quot; and bubbles.  Just the facts,man, like it used to be!  I will be removing this app.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Khalid Hosseini is a brilliant writer. Each character in this book sticks with you and stays in your mind and heart for a long time after finishing the book. The way my eyes see people has changed. We do not know what sorrow or hardship people come from or are going through. Great Acknowledgement at the end with info on the refugee relief effort Hosseini is a part of.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is NERVE WRECKING!  I got so involved in finding groups of three I forget everything else I'm supposed to be looking for.  This game provides a lot of fun and entertainment .
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|The is is the best game I ever played I'm my whole life the graphics and the update is amazing
B00AALX5SI|5.0|I love Katy Perry and I love this concert movie! I could watch it again and again! Definitely a must see for every Katy fan!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great puzzles that keep you interested and engaged. Only bad thing is that it's a little too short and takes up a lot of memory to install. I still think it's way worth it
159463176X|3.0|Unlike his other stories, I do not think Khaled developed his characters that well in this book.  He attempted build  multiple facets but in end, in my opinion, resulted in none that were very well constructed.<br /><br />But what do I know, I am an engineer :)
B004FDPOHC|4.0|It's lacking something not having the movie's visuals. I don't think one does well without the other. Still there's lots of layers and complexities to this score you won't notice on the first listen. A great example of how good electronic music compositions can be.
B00004RJ71|1.0|Well, that's essentially a quote from my wife. My nephew wanted to watch this movie so I looked around for it on Netflix, etc. When I saw I could get buy it for about the price of a rental, I went ahead and ordered it. He and my wife watched it one night and I heard the reviews the next day. Terrible acting, etc. I'd suggest you pass on this one.
B00CLZ4B4I|4.0|was cheaper then going out and buying the dvd and this I can play on any computer that I have around me, keeps me from scratching up dvds while traveling<br />.
B000NGTJTY|1.0|I watched the trailer on this movie and thought it would be good. It has terrible language form the first minute and is extremely violent. I had to turn it off after just a few minutes. It was a waste of my money.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I loved it.  Could not put it down.  Am a huge Gaiman fan and this is one of his many different moods but one of the type I really love to read.  Don't know where he gets his inspirations but I feel he has a rare gift.  He works in so many different mediums that it boggles the ordinary mind.  He and Stephen King are so prolific and versatile it is scary.  They may be \\"Gods\\" or \\"Aliens\\" themselves.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Bearable and watchable because of the special effects.  The real-life actors are overshadowed by the cooler and more impressive Giants.
B000IMKDPC|5.0|I've seen this movie tons and tons of times and yet watching it again after years of not seeing it, I still love it.
B002GYI9C4|4.0|I am a huge fiction fan and had run out of books. Picked this one randomly and loved it!... was hard to put down... the last one of the series felt rushed, though...
B003QSMC18|5.0|My son and I can watch this movie over and over and never get tired of it. My favorite &#34;princess&#34; movie since the Little Mermaid!
B0050XFY4O|2.0|Crazy story line, I never heard of that kind of thing going on but I guess it happens. Brothers? Really?
B00COHAUD4|5.0|I love horror movies and I've been very disappointed with new ones as of late - until I watched this one. I didn't expect the ending and the characters & story were great.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|David Weber has yet again written another exciting and riveting book. The story keeps you reading from chapter to chapter. I not only highly recommend this book, but the whole series as well!
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|I love Ethan Hawke and the story of this movie was great. I love the myth of it all and the &#34;villain&#34; was definitely scary.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Lots of fun for parents and kids and teens of all ages! Having allot of fun with this game! Loooooove it
B00DP3IESY|5.0|What a great surprise! Tom Cruise delivers a great performance! This is the best original sci-fi film i have seen since the 5th Element.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|so I played it on a phone andi loved it then I got a kindle it was biggger I. was so happy then I earned a whole bunch of blunt and I clicked in the mailbox and it spent all of my blunt on 1 pet so I uninstalled and redid all of it but its still fun!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Love the character of Rose. On a more serious note, how many children must suffer at the hands of priests and nuns who are supposed to represent God's love and instead display the worst kind of human behavior possible.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Best series I have ever read. I think I might enjoy it more than Harry Potter, and that's saying something.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|It is awesome it is the best game. You get to make stuff<br />  And if you read this it was  from luke it ii s awesome ggggggggggggggggggggg gghuvfhvggjgu

B005544TRQ|5.0|I had never seen Suits and when I watched it on my Kindle, I got hooked!  I watched Season Two as well and am now watching Season Three on Cable every Tuesday.
B000FA5SMK|3.0|I found the hidden treasure plot uninteresting, but the bio-hazard twist and the final chapters were exciting and what I enjoy in DeMille's writings.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game its so fun and the minons are so funny I really love the outside of the lab
B006MHWXMS|5.0|Combines everything you can possibly need in one app. Syncs with Google and does a great job keeping you up to date for forgetting a loved ones birthday or other special occasion.
B0034G4OWM|5.0|This movie came as expected. Movie plays perfectly and it is extremely funny. Family friendly and great for all ages.
0765325950|4.0|I've been a long time fan of The Wheel of Time Series, having read it from the very beginning.  Some of the middle books after Lord of Chaos fell a little flat, but Jordan (and Sanderson for the last three) picked up the pace with the last few books, returning the reader to the fantastical world created in the beginning.<br /><br />A Memory of Light is a lot different than the other books in the series.  Where most of the books revolved around a central plot with multiple story lines feeding in to and off of, this one had one main focus: The Last Battle.  Literally the whole book was devoted to the battle being waged by light and dark and you are constantly being bombarded with scenes of death and the struggle to survive.  As with any ending to an epic adventure, there will be deaths to some of your favorite characters, ones that make your jaw drop, even though you suspected something like that would happen.<br /><br />Sanderson does a wonderful job in recreating an ending that Jordan had foreseen and prepared for.  There are times where you can notice a difference between their two writing styles, but I didn't notice this too often as I was caught up in the story.  I wish at times that there was a bit more plot than one massive struggle throughout the book, but the way the series was written it was inevitable that the series would end this way.<br /><br />Finally, it is sad that TOR doesn't make the Kindle version available at the same time as the book is published, but it doesn't really make sense why the book would be given so many 1 stars just because of this.  People have forgotten on what they are reviewing.  When the Kindle version comes out, give that a 1 star and lambast it for what it is, but don't rate something that most all of the 1 stars didn't even read simply because they are mad that it's not the version they were looking for.<br /><br />4 stars.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|movie has a good story to it. my wife had to watch it twice she loved.the acting is well done. And the story is well written
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|After reading it, I ordered copies for each of my five children aging from  their mid 30s to their mid 50s
B000HL2J0G|5.0|This program teaches you to use your mind!!  He makes stuff out of almost nothing!!  You have to fall in love with a clean cut guy who doesn't use foul mouth!!
B00B69UQEO|1.0|This is not DM of the 80's, 90's, 00's, and is vaguely recognizable as anything DM.  I know it takes a lot of talent and years of dedication and hard work to be successful in the music industry, and am thankful for everything DM has produced...until this.  When I hear songs from this album it makes me think of someone trying to play an electric piano that is missing half of its keys, in some dark, dingy, run down, back alley bar in a middle of nowhere town.  I still have \\"faith\\" that it is within them to make good music, this just isn't it.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|I grew up watching Beach Blanket Bingo & I loved how similar this movie was.  My 4 boys loved it too!!!  The characters were perfect.  They got an extra kick that the butler from Jesse was the villain.  I just preordered our copy!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is a great book.  I can't wait to read the rest of them.  The HBO series is good but the book is great.
B008N1LL42|5.0|Battleship is one of those &#34; How it could happen &#34; sci-fi - action movies that really makes you think of just how small and alone we are in our little corner of our universe and how at any moment someone or something could decide to pay us a visit. This movie also teaches a good lesson about a guy growing up and his life going in the wrong direction takes a turn when he makes a life changing choice to join the Navy and become someone. I would recommend this movie to anyone young or old but not to young without parental supervision. To sum it all up it's a great movie to watch.
B004ZG5EYC|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  If you have not seen it you should.  The music sound track is fabulous.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|Supernatural has a great storyline and some awesome visual effects. The story is kinda believeable to where this is what may have happened and the way it could have turned out if we lived in parallel universe. There is a spiritual feeling to the story line later on in the show that gives you a believeable feeling like this could have happened or might happen. The actors do a great job in portraying their parts. I would recommend this show to any sci-fi enthusiast.
B00DGKQ5I2|5.0|We came as Romans is a hard working band! And i think they did a great job with this album, even though there isn't anything too different here. What is there is strong! With some great lyrics and musicianship
034580709X|5.0|Jo Nesbo is great and Harry Hole is something else, can't wait for the new one to come out and see what happens nest
B000GTJT0C|1.0|If you choose to buy this, make sure you check your disc right away! I waited 6 weeks to watch it, found out it is a bad disc, and cannot return it because of Amazon's time window for returns! Very frustrating!!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I loved every minute of this series and will probably purchase other seasons.  Very good picture of the world of the time and the oncoming empowerment of women in general.  Also a good picture of the growing middle class and how it came to be.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This was a well written little &#34;book&#34;. I put book in quotes because its not long - more a novella. Gaiman could have done so much more with character development with the magical women and the &#34;creatures&#34;. A really good editor would have given this novella back and said, &#34;Give me 200 more pages.&#34;
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I enjoy always playing games like this one.  Very easy to control, unlike some other games that have such bad controls you'd want to just delete.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|The cast was quite good and it appeared they were having fun making the movie. It was good light entertainment.
B003E6LC6I|5.0|Love, love, love this show.  So much going on at nice, keeps you guessing and has twists you don't see coming!
B000I186FW|5.0|Its the new United States.  Great lesson.  Action and a good plot.  Too many words required to do this :)
B005544TRQ|4.0|Great story lines great characters great writing will keep watching as much of this as I canMust be lawyers writing this
B005COO1X6|3.0|Mile 81 is a boarded up rest stop on Maine Highway.  Pete Simmons lives in near it and he decides to go there when he has nothing better to do.  He was not allowed to go hang out with his older brothers and his friends.  So Pete decides to go to Mile 81 because that is what the big kids do.  At the rest stop Pete finds a discarded bottle of vodka and after drinking it he falls asleep.  Then a mud splattered station wagon shows up  and wreaks havoc.<br /><br />Mile 81 is part coming of age and part horror story. It reminds me of Christine and Stand By Me. I thought that Mile 81 was a bit lengthy and dragged in parts. When car after car came to the rest stop it got really boring for me. It was just an OK read for me.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I absolutely loved this show. I was obsessed by the 2 episode.  Watched the entire first season (15 episodes) in 2 sittings.  I can't recommend it enough.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It was tricky at some points , by  overall a good game . I enjoyed the brain challenge and doing multiple things at once . I also enjoyed the memorization challenge
1451683405|4.0|I have always been fascinated on the topic of free will and love to read various sides on the subject. Dr. Harris helped show me a different side of free will all in fewer than 96 pages. To do this book justice I would compare it to eating a burger from Five Guys Burgers and Fries. The presentation is underrated but when the reader sinks their teeth into its substances a lot of incredible things happen. I tend to highlight quotes or key ideas that I think are interesting or deserve a second look. For as short of a book as this is there are a lot of highlighter marks left behind. Dr. Harris further helped solidify my stance on there is no such thing as free will. Looking forward to reading more of Dr. Harris' brilliant work.
B009CF3P7E|2.0|Love the movie, and the quality is great, but I wish I could download the HD file to my PC to playback through my Media Center that I use as a Blu-Ray, Cable Box, CD player, Pandora player, Netflix, Media library, etc.  I can download the standard definition file, which is better than nothing, but I had to buy it, too, so I had to pay twice to get it to play on my PC in my entertainment system.<br /><br />Which brings me to another gripe.  I am sorely disappointed that Amazon doesn't have a Windows Media Center/XBox Media Center plugin available for folks using that technology.  I have to use my Smart TV's remote to access my Amazon Instant Videos, which defeats the purpose of having an all-in-one box in my system.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|Great acting, suspense, storyline, characters and it keeps you wanting more.  I love everything about it.  Visually they did a great job with this show.
B002RI9PKO|5.0|Loved the book. Must read for PE teachers or any teacher for that matter. I'm not a big reader, but Gladwell had me from the very first page.
B00BNGFGIQ|3.0|I got bored with it after a while.... it's like angry birds in a way.  Just doesn't change as much so i got bored.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|The number goes too fast for 4 cards.  I also have trouble gettiing the numbers to mark on.  Iike to play the 2 cards.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Really enjoyed this season! It leaves you spellbound for season 4. I can't wait for season 4 to come out. Make sure that you watch the first 2 seasons or you will be in the dark. Enjoy!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|What can be said about seeing all your childhood hero's in one movie.  It was great and I can't wait for Avengers 2 to come out.
B000LXHK22|5.0|Russell Crowe is at his comedic best! This is the film that launched Marion Cotillard to US audiences. I can watch it over and over!

B001DCZ4IW|5.0|Fast service.  Glad you had the movie in stock. We really love this movie.  It's a classic. Thank you very much.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|The actors were well known but the material was a bit boring in my opinion.  I think there was too much hype about this movie.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|sorta okay, thought this 007 lacked some finesse and savoir faire as previous actors. Nice actions not many gadgets though.
B000FC146C|5.0|This is one of those books that completely pull you in.  I couldn't put it down.  I &#34;lived&#34; with these people and could hardly wait to get home from work each day to dive back into their world.  Exquisitely written.

B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Very fun game that is hard to put down. Thankfully I have other games that are addictive as well or I'd never put this one down. The graphics are beautiful as well.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I had just purchased a leather bound ESV Bible and decided to download the e-version to my Kindle. I do use the e-Bible most of the time. I carry the Kindle to church for reference and it is easy to find passages of scripture quickly.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I saw this before and liked it, so wanted to add it to my DVD collection.  It's a good movie, with a couple good storiesof friendship and beginning love.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This series has incredible characters with deep character development. The producers have strived for authenticity throughout. Great entertainment and wonderful way to learn a little 19th century history.
0452295548|1.0|lots of good information, easy to read. all you have to do is get involved and be sincere to yourself
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good app. Wish horses where cheaper and easier to level up horses are life like should add a vet section and horse shoeing
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|It was touching and well directed. The movie rightly presented and credit the efforts of local people helping tourists which was not covered much in the media.
B001JI7WTO|5.0|The only complain is that I need to have my PC and I could not watch it on my tablet or ipod.
B00D2ZF3GQ|4.0|I think the first mistake the studio (or whoever makes these decisions) was the advertising and everyone was thinking it was another \\"Avatar.\\"  This picture's basic premise is the relationship between father and son and secondary was the planet and its inhabitants (beasts).  Now once I realized that, I enjoyed it for what it was.  Not perfect . . . but I like Will Smith.  Everyone's expectations these days going to see sci fi movies is very high with all Hollywood has available (CGI for example).  No one expects to see a movie for it's story . . . although I will admit that this was not the best story.  I did read a snippet somewhere that Will Smith used some ideas/theories from Scientology, but what I know about Scientology could fit on top of a pin, can't verify that. Still, I like the movie for what it was . . . summer movie fare.
B000OCZD5G|5.0|I gave it to my husband for his Christmas and he loves this movie. He already saw it thousand times.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|The Luck of the Weissensteiners is an epic historical fiction based Eastern Europe during World War II.  This story - the tale of two families - will captivate readers immediately and hold them mesmerized until the final page.  These two families, one Jewish and one Catholic, find their fates entwined as they fight for survival among the fascist then communist invasion of Slovakia.  It is a gripping tale and incredibly thrilling.  Among all World War II historical fiction novels I would certainly place this within the must-read books.<br /><br />Consider for a moment the beginning sentences of the book synopsis: \\"In the sleepy town of Bratislava in 1933 a romantic girl falls for a bookseller from Berlin. Greta Weissensteiner, daughter of a Jewish weaver, slowly settles in with the Winkelmeier clan just as the developments in Germany start to make waves in Europe. The political climate in the multifaceted cultural jigsaw puzzle of disintegrating Czechoslovakia becomes more complex and affects relations between the couple and the families.  The story follows their lot through the war with its predictable and also its unexpected turns and events and the equally hard times after.\\"<br /><br />I was enraptured with Greta and Wilhelm from the very beginning.  I fell in love with their characters, the setting, the story and the history.  The history of the time is heavy in this novel with very little fictional embellishment but that only made it more delightful of a read for me.  I appreciate the care that Fischer took to verify the accuracy of history and the details of the time.  The embellishment came from the personal stories of the characters themselves; the details of the countries, the political culture and the moral attitudes were all grounded in proven fact and historical accounts of Eastern Europe during World War II.<br /><br />Many historical fiction novels set in Eastern Europe during World War II fall prey to the easy plot of beginning during the height of the anti-semitic attitudes and behaviors.  Very few books that I have read have dared to approach the introduction and growth of this culture.  Fischer did not fall prey to that trap in The Luck of the Weissensteiners.  Fischer approached the swelling anti-semitic movement from the early stages and allowed it to foster and grow throughout the story.  As a result the reader is able to feel a continually growing feeling of fear and trepidation as the story develops.<br /><br />It is challenging to discuss too much of the plot without giving away critical details to the story.  All I can truly say without feeling as though I'm providing too many spoilers is that Greta, a young Jewish girl and Wilhelm, a young German man, meet at a local bookshop, marry and start a family.  They have a wonderful marriage built on mutual love, admiration and respect; that is, until the anti-semitic movement begins to grow and consume the mentality of Eastern Europe.  What follows is a heartbreaking story of love, fear, prejudice and betrayal.  I was enamored with this story and only regret that I read it so quickly.  This is a book that deserves to be read slowly and pleasurably.  I encourage any reader who decides to follow my recommendation and read The Luck of the Weissensteiners to read it slowly and over at least a week to really focus on the story, connect with the characters and savor every moment.<br /><br />Review by Ashley LaMar<br />Closed the Coveranti-semitic attitudes and behaviors.

B009SJ3GUK|2.0|I really wanted to give this 2 1/2  stars for Ms. Lange's performance but it wouldn't let me.<br />Although Jessica Lange is amazing in any role Season 2 just seems to be horrifically violent just for the sake of being violent.Way too much carnage against women and just not a very interesting story line. I watched several episodes thinking it would get better  but it really didn't.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|No more Lisbeth.  I'm sooo sad.  What a character she is in literature.  And what an almighty shame about Steig Larsson's untimely death. Not only did Sweden lose an advocate for human rights and especially women, but the literary world suffered a devastating loss.  I've read he had planned a total of ten books.  Just think of the adventures (not sure that's the correct word) Lisbeth could have gotten up to! If you want to spend several days in the world of Lisbeth Salander, one of the best characters ever created, then immerse yourself in these books.  You won't regret it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|See my Review for Season 2: with the addition that you need to be prepared for some heart-felt tears.  But what brilliant writing, acting, sets, etc.  And (as a history buff), you get a real 'feel' for all the changes that happened during that time. It's my favorite historical period to read about and now I get to actually LIVE it in my heart through this Series.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 was brutal and heartwrenching.  But it is addicting, I need more!  Love Shirley Maclaine I hope she comes back next season!  Sob :(  Cousin Matthew!!!!!  Please tell me it is a dream!!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I had been hearing rave reviews from all my friends, but I said to myself that I wasn't going to even look at the Series: I had too much to do, etc.  Well, in a moment of weakness, I decided to purchase a copy.  I knew I would be bored.  (I really don't know myself that well, always)....I fell in love with it from this 1st Season.  The characters are written in an extremely well-rounded fashion; it's difficult not to like a character because, like all humans, no one is all evil or all good either.  Just when I thought I had each character 'pegged'...something would happen to change my mind and heart.  I don't ever remember seeing anything like it before on the small or large screen.  Maggie Smith, to me steals the show, but this might be due to the fact her character is written in such an lovely eccentric way.  THANKYOU, EVERYONE; the show's writer, the actors and all the men and women behind the scenes that make this delightful/happy/sad/shocking/satisfying series.
B005HEPN06|5.0|just love the series. to me it is the best tv series of the star trek family. i own the whole complete series

B003DZX3SA|4.0|Beauty and the Beast, another Disney Renaissance Masterpiece!<br />found the 2 Disc Platinum edition at 2nd and Charles for (Drum Roll.....)$10.32.<br />So again with my other reviews of Disney movies.  Excellent Movie! Disney knocks another one out of the park!... Not for 30-50 dollars though. Disney knows how to make a buck.  :)
B009YN2M7S|3.0|Nicholas Sparks has been known to be such a wonderful author, but I felt shorted in this book.  It seems that authors these days are putting angels, dreams, imagination, etc. in books and films and it takes away from the validity of the story.  I feel cheated when a character is an angel or an event was a figment of the imagination or you learn they wake up and are dreaming.  I thought Nicholas was a better writer.  How come Jo couldn't be just what the book said she was?  It did not add to the story that she was a reincarnate of a person that died.  Too far fetched to me and very unbelieveable.  I was upset and doubt that I read any more of his books.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is awsome for a kindle not th  best virtuale city game ever but pretty damn good for a amazon app on the kindle well done dudes and thanks.
B00BESNKB8|5.0|If you are a fan of these movies, you will definitely love it. Excellent casting and plot, graphics and music.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This is a great game. My only problems are that it will sometimes give you missions you've all ready done. And only having Internet connection to play. But I recommend to anyone who likes strategy games.
B00COHIFQS|4.0|By reading the story I was expecting more. At the end I had weird feelings about this movie, I wanted to have different end
B008MM9630|4.0|Yeah, it's a cute little game. There's not very much to do, but the plants are cool ans it's not like the money's really tight or anything, just save your jems.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show, great cast! You just want to keep watching it. Amazing stories and thrilling lines. I would totally recommend this of you like lawyer type shows.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. You really have to explore and think. If you like puzzle games, then this one is for you!!
B008Y768XO|5.0|This heartwarming, amazing story held the interest of the oldest and the youngest of us watching it. I highly recommend it for all ages.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game its so much fun the graphics are great and are never blurry! I love my horse shes great. This game is wonderful!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't wait until the next season.  I really got  hooked. The story line really draws you in and you want to see more.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Excellent read. I was emmersed in the story. I loved how the characters all intertwined. Wonderful ending. Highly recommend it.
B008XG1X18|3.0|its okay I guess. sometimes its slow and wont let me on for days. sometimes it just freezes altogether and wont let me on for months.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Khaled Hosseini takes one through the life struggles of two women in such a way that one can see what they see, feel what they feel, and above all, hurt when they hurt. This book has really opened my eyes to the plight of women in countries like Afghanistan. It's a very sad story, yet uplifting in many aspects.  When I was done reading, I felt grateful and fortunate for the life I live.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|A Feast for Crows continues to be like the three that came before, a book I was unable to put down.  I don't want to adventure to end.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I love this game! especially the fact that you can buy all the extras with money you earn with gameplay. I decided to purchase the full version because it's perfect for killing some time.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|This game could be SO GREAT if they fixed the bugs. And made it easier to get the silver coins needed to play the game.  Its annoying because its not free. You have to wait an hour 2 win coins to play or purchase them :-( booo uno!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Very interesting insight into one woman's time in a minimum security federal woman's prison.<br /><br />A fascinating read - it is not the day-to-day life in the prison, it is the cast of characters, many if whom Ms. Kerman calls friends by the end who tell the story.  I would love to know who, if any, of the inmates Ms. Kerman still maintains contact.<br /><br />I finished the first season of the Netflix show based on Ms. Kerman's life - heavily dramatized for the audience but bits and pieces of the real novel have been interwoven within.  Those that are looking for a verbatim retelling will be sorry, but those seeking the true story will not be disappointed.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I like the app but the recent changes make it impossible to read the feels like temperature. I liked the old way better.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is a heartwarming series that the whole family can enjoy!  I highly recommend it... and of course the acting is of highest quality!  Enjoy all seasons!
0151013047|4.0|Unusual (Monologue), Well Written (Simple Language, Good Description, Words flow from one page to another). Deals with very common emotions that people from Indian subcontinent go through while living in USA. Good read even for americans/westerners who like to have an opinion on Pakistan/India and people from that region. Regardless of your nationality, a very good book that lays bare the thought processes in a retrospective manner.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun Challenge . It keeps you thinking and focused on the small details in the room. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a game that keeps you thinking and solving puzzles.
B00BRBIA6C|3.0|Agnetha sounds as beautiful as ever on this album.  The material is not at the same level of quality, though.<br /><br />None of Elofsson's songs stand out as especially well written; none are particularly poor; they are all acceptable love songs, but Agnetha deserves better.  I found \\"I Keep Them on the Floor Beside My Bed\\" to be one of the strongest tracks and the best at conveying the emotions in Agnetha's voice. I wish that Agnetha had contributed more of her writing talents to the album, as she has a firm grip on the style that suits her.<br /><br />In contrast to \\"Wrap Your Arms Around Me\\", the songs on \\"A\\" have a musical formula which is rarely strayed from. \\"Dance Your Pain Away\\"  and \\"Back On Your Radio\\" are the only songs that can't be classified as `soft and slow' or a `love ballad'.  They help add variety to the album, but it is too little, too late.  Ultimately it is not enough to keep the album interesting enough as a whole.<br /><br />The actual music lacks range and imagination.  The synthesized drums work more as a clock, counting the seconds of the album as they flow, seemingly unchanged from song to song.  The orchestration is flat and two dimensional.  There is an over-reliance on swelling strings to provide \\"Oomph,\\" but there is little detail or depth to build anything beyond a simple melody on.  The venture is completely lacking in the richness of ABBA's recordings.<br /><br />The album is not without its charms. \\"Dance Your Pain Away\\" and \\"Back On Your Radio\\" both have a hint of playfulness that is very appealing; while \\"Perfume In the Breeze\\" and \\"I Keep Them on the Floor Beside My Bed\\" come off as very genuine in conveying Agnetha's actual feelings.<br /><br />Overall, the album was disappointing.  It was still very nice to hear Agnetha's beautiful voice.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie, and had one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen. Can't spoil it.<br />Definitely worth watching.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|Fantastic movie!!! Varied differently from the original, but throughly enjoyed it. Will definitely watch the sequel when it comes out.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Fun for the time it lasts.  Not enough levels.  Would be more fun if levels got progressively more challenging.  Whole game is fairly easy.  I am looking for more games like this with more of a challenge.  Would not pay for a full length version, too easy.
B0002VFXFE|4.0|If you need some thermal paste that will keep your CPU properly cooled this is a safe bet. It's affordable, easy to apply, and does the job.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|When I got this game I was glad it wasn't a fake spin off. This game is legitly addicting.bottom line is BEST GAME EVER!!!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I love the story that's all I could say it was wonderful and I would tell everybody to read it
B005544TRQ|5.0|The casting in this show is great. Each character is unique and each gives you a different insight into the Law
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome. This book is awesome. It always kept me on the edge of my seat. I am looking forward to the movie too.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This season teaches that there is no such thing as perfect loyalty and perfect honesty when competing to be the best at practicing Law.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was a wonderful story. Remarkable even. Loved it!!! You should read it its an awesome book. You'll like it!!!!
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|I thought the plot was good! Very Twisted!<br /><br />Loved the actors in the movie!<br /><br />I would recommend someone renting it
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Just about the coolest Kindle game I have played.  Great graphics, creative puzzles, one of a kind (although I wish there were more like it)!
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|I love the actors. The story line is good, but conversation volume was off.<br />for sure renter movie, but glad i watched it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent writing, wonderful casting, outstanding acting, faithful historical depiction, beautiful sets. I could go on and on, but I will suggest that you give this series a try.
1451675046|5.0|Richard Dawkins describes our world in great detail to show how reality appears magical before we know the true facts.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My whole family is addicted to this fun game. You've got to be quick thinking with this fast paced game.
B000FCKC4C|3.0|This is an easy quick read with some admittedly good teachings, but I found it to be pretty basic in it's philosophy and execution.  I couldn't help but feel that the author was trying to hard to write an important allegory, but didn't really have anything new to offer in message or approach.
B00B5AP7NY|1.0|Seven days after ordering this item and two others from this location, it still hasn't even been prepared for shipping.  Be careful.  Do NOT order if (as I do) you need it for a grandchild's birthday.  I am so miffed.  Amazon hasn't done this to me before and I order a LOT from them.
B001BANK32|4.0|I only read this after discovering that King has penned a sequel to come out later this year (Doctor Sleep).  I can't wait to see what King has in store for us...  The Shining will introduce you to a world where nightmares are not in short supply.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Plan to take time with this game!!! Fun though. Lots to do from feeding to cleaning urge paddock to riding in competitions.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Was fun. But could have been explained a little more in the beginning. Enjoyable idea though. Looking forward to more levels.
B008ALAHA4|3.0|Just hate that Apple nickel and dimes you for every little accessory when you move from one generation to another.
B004GYY714|4.0|There's always room for improvement.  The stations connect very fast.  I can swith between favorites in seconds.  Just think about it, one minute I can listen to a station in Seattle and then I can switch to a station in New York in no time.<br />This works much better on my Kindle than it does on my phone.  Hopefully all stations will start broadcasting over the internet.
B0061US58C|3.0|Well my kids (6 and 3 years old) enjoyed it, which i guess is the point. My wife and I weren't as thrilled about it. It was definitely MUCH more violent than the original Cars. Other than  a few of the main characters, it bore little resemblance to the first movie. I thought the first movie was clever, original, funny, and well done. The second movie wasn't nearly as clever or funny. I have to give some credit to Pixar for creating a somewhat original movie. Most sequels nowadays just rehash the same gags as the previous movie, so at least Cars2 was different. But I thought it was too far different than the previous movie. I really enjoyed the Mater's Tall Tales movie, so I was hoping Cars 2 would be more like that.
0979019710|5.0|I rate The Miracle Morning as the single book that motivated me to change my life for the better. If \\"7 Habits of Highly Effective People\\" gave me the framework for success, \\"The Miracle Morning\\" gave me the powers for execution. I highly recommend you to buy this book and change your life forever!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great fun little game.  If you are a fan a must have.  If you're not get it anyway since the minions are too cute not to love.  Only problem you can't just do a quick run, you find yourself just trying one more time.my entire family is addicted including my six year old who has the highest score of all of us.
B005544V6A|5.0|This show has attitude.  What do I mean by this?  This scene from Tombstone comes to mind: [...]  But seriously, Harvey Spector brings the thunder - and it's good.
B007H7XJD4|5.0|It's a great movie and Henry Cavill is absolutely gorgeous and an amazing actor.  Rent it, buy it...but watch it anyway you can!!!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I enjoyed this book and feel it a part of history that more generations of Americans need to learn more information about.
B005HEPN06|5.0|Excellent season of an excellent show. Maybe not quite as fresh as season 3 was in retrospect, but still many memorable hours. Looking forward to getting this on Blu-ray. Until then, this okay quality version will have to do.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Couldn't have made a better one. A simple &amp; Easy  calculator to use &amp; it's exactly what I was looking for.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|What else can I say, that hasn't been said before me... this book is great. And that's without me being an 80s person. I'm born in the mid 80s and most of the things I remember from this period is eating and sleeping. Yet I love video games and this book describes the dreams of every gamer out there. OASIS is a fully immersive virtual reality, where pretty much everything is possible. A world that feels and looks pretty much as the real one, have all the good and over the top stuff, with little to none of the bad. Yet, is it really better than the one we live in...<br />The author manage to deliver a solid, engaging experience. The action moments felt a little rushed tho', a page or two on the story shaping moments would've been good, imho.<br /><br />Anyway, you don't really need my review on this one, just buy it and read it. I promise, you won't regret it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So much better than the Fire Stick - go for this item or a Roku so you don't get disa[ppointed by the problems plaguing the Fire Stick.
B00915G6YE|5.0|This is, by far, one of the best seasons of Dexter among all of the previous seasons. Can't wait for the final season 8 to be out. Definitely worth every single cent of it for fans of the series.
B009AMANBA|4.0|We enjoyed this look at a portion of Lincoln's life.  This movie humanized Lincoln and helped us to see him more as a man than just a legendary historical figure.  It only covered a small portion of his life, but it was an interesting story, nevertheless.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|Nice game, entertaining, simple and couldn't stop playing it. I had no issues with it. I ordered free on the app of the day. Try it!
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|We are fans of the prior Men in Black movies.  With that in mind we enjoyed this third installment.  It provides some back story for J and K, which are interesting to us as fans.
B008602KQI|5.0|Worth Watching....Nice Screen Play...Good Acting..The entire crew in the team ready did a great job and it is a complete movie
B0019LY5IM|5.0|Im a big fan of this show so the review is 5 stars... two thumbs... ten toes!!!! and whatever else!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I've got 40+ years of reading behind me and this was a real jaw dropper.  Perfect book.  Great summer read.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is the best series I have ever watched, cannot wait for its' return ! Sad about the season's finally though!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|What a great book.  Here is the effect it had on me:<br />I am no longer comfortable with the dependency the typical paycheck job has.  The ideas presented candidly are each a small push forward to establishing myself well beyond the financial aspect of life.<br />I'm practicing daily to being happy, making millions and living the dream.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A very well written book that hold the reader's attention from beginning to end. The authors told the story from beginning to end with insights into the thinking of each participant and their life experiences. One of very best books that I have read in quite some time. Highly recommended reading.
B00CWVFPGO|5.0|Totally underestimated the entertainment I'd get out of one of Arnold's traditional action flicks. Almost as if in some of the dialog Arnold was trying to tell his fans something...hmmm. Great movie. Little too gory for my kids, but it was tolerable.
B00C2FFJFM|5.0|Consider Selena's ambitions when creating this album: she wanted to create a completely dance record for her fans, show her transition into womanhood, and say goodbye to music (to pursue a fulfilling acting career) with a sort of pop .. I mean pomp and circumstance.<br /><br />I think most of her detractors (and published music critics) fail to realize that about Selena Gomez. She is not a vocal powerhouse like Demi Lovato or Miley Cyrus, and never set out to be. Like 99% of the Disney girls before her (and the ones waiting in the wings), a music career was handed to her on a silver platter to enhance her brand image. Knowing this, does that mean that the music (the product) is automatically bad?<br /><br />No. Not at all.<br /><br />Selena Gomez has topped the charts, went on tours, and sold millions of albums. Not because Disney was forcing people to buy into it, but because Selena actually is a talented, charismatic, artist that people pay attention to. Her \\"it\\" factor is exactly what's made this album go number one on iTunes almost instantly. She puts her heart into her music, and each album of hers has gotten progressively more polished and emotionally mature.<br /><br />\\"Stars Dance\\" is a cohesive, exciting, textured album that keeps everyone dancing. Even the stodgiest of listeners can't help but coo along with Selena on the chorus of \\"Come & Get It\\". Selena experiments with dubstep (because she loves the genre, not because it's music's \\"flavor of the moment\\"), dancehall, and even urban hip-hop.<br /><br />I've listened to this album at least 10 times when it was available on iTunes a week in advance and I can honestly say that almost all of the songs stand out as pieces of pop perfection. Whether it be the stuttered choruses of \\"Slow Down\\" and \\"Save The Day\\", or the light-as-air electro waves of \\"Write Your Name\\" and \\"Undercover\\", each song has something new to offer.<br /><br />\\"Birthday\\" is admittedly the most risque song of the album, featuring moans and plenty of double entendre lyrics. On the end of album, \\"Love Will Remember\\" is the complete opposite: a somber ballad co-written by Gomez.<br /><br />Every album has a weak point, and in this one it's \\"Like A Champion\\" which sounds too much like a Rihanna copycat with it's fake accent and \\"rum pa pa pum's\\".<br /><br />Other than that, I've enjoyed every one of these songs, even the Target exclusive bonus tracks: \\"Lover In Me\\" and \\"I Like It That Way\\". Selena's vocal attitude varies from sassy to sweet and she makes each song her own. It's hard not to think of her relationship troubles with Justin Bieber on songs like \\"Forget Forever\\". Regardless of whether or not Selena relates to every single lyric of every single song, she knows how to execute them with conviction or emotion when the time is right.<br /><br />Of course all the credit can't go to Selena alone. The brilliant production credits go to The Cataracs, Rock Mafia, & theSUSPEX. The catchy lyrics come from pop-writing heavyweights Ester Dean, Toby Gad, Daniel James, and a plethora of others (with co-writing efforts from Gomez herself).<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend this album to the pop enthusiast or anyone looking for party/workout music, because this fits the bill. I'm looking forward to how Selena translates this album into dance for her Stars Dance 2013 Tour!plenty of double entendre lyrics.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is the best book I have read in about a year.  I have recommended this book to all my friends.  Very well written.  This book made me sad at one moment and happy the next.  Great read.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I started with the Kite Runner several years ago & loved it. Recently I read the second book A Thousand Splendid Suns, I couldn't put it down it was so well written & informative. As soon as I finished book two I ordered And the Mountains Echoed. I was not disappointed, it was as good as the first two. I'm waiting anxiously for Khaled Hosseini next novel. He's become one of my favorite authors.
B008JFUO36|5.0|Science fiction is more than just laser swords and alien space battles.  At its heart, science fiction is about showing how the human condition fairs in a futuristic setting.  Oblivion is the Science Fiction that those of us who love Sci-Fi have been yearning for.  It has heart, it has spirit, realism of character, and a plot that is not full of holes or typical contrived Hollywood bs.<br /><br />If you liked Moon then you will love Oblivion.
B0060QM09M|5.0|This book was delightful reading.  I would be a great choice for everyone from 10yrs up.  The stories give an idea of how things were in England during the 1930's and during World War II and later.  It is rich with excellent writing.  I loved all the books written by James Herriott.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|Such a treat to have all the various versions on one bluray.  The transfer is gorgeous and well worth purchasing.
B004P96WJ0|5.0|Fantastic performances, glorious sound and HD Video! Ressurection Symphony is particularly outstanding. A test for your audio equipment, especially the conclusion!
B00B49L7JY|4.0|Go into it with an open mind and you will be pleasantly surprised.  Don't let anyone tell you anything about it, though, and avoid all synopses so it won't be ruined!!
B004YM6JP0|5.0|I didn't realize I bought the bluray and dvd combo pack, so that was a nice surprise. The show just keeps getting better and better, Can't wait to see more!
B000VDDWDS|4.0|Fantastic adventure story.  Russell Crowe does an amazing job.  I particularly like the visual effects work from ILM.  They rock :)
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|I love the Underworld movies and this one didn't disappoint me. I felt like it was a little shorter than others but it was still good.
B000Q67876|5.0|I am always in the mood to watch this film.  The Bluray transfer is truly spectacular.  Can't praise this movie highly enough!
B002AT4K9Q|5.0|I love all the Fast and Furious movies. This one is just as good as the others. A great addition to my movie collection!
B002BJGYU8|5.0|Great show overall, but in season 2 they are really hitting a good stride.  If you've never visited Stars Hollow, I recommend you pop in the first season immediately!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I liked khaled's other book but this one was confusing to me with all the jumping around of characters and places.
B009RI4ZKC|3.0|Not as good as Rushmore or Royal Tennenbaums in my opinion, but still an interesting film that is a level above most current films.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game took a bit of getting used to, but that was part of the fun. Each floor made me feel more detective savvy.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|Not much substance and you'll have to check you healthy sense of disbelief at the door, but not a horrible way to spend a couple of hours.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|What a great show! Could watch it over again! There won't be another one like that! Too bad it's over!
B004EF65QA|5.0|Loved watching this. It's excellent and heartfelt. Will probably watch it again. Characters are well drawn and actors are fabulous.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me and I loved it. I am 10, and I would definitely recommend to others who like Greek mythology. It was a little bit confusing, but other than that this is the best book in the series so far. I can't wait for the next book in the series to come out.
B004IYISSK|5.0|This book was a very wonderfully written book about the lives of some Chinese women... Their stores are told with such grace and respect. The ending is very sad... I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|PLEASE remove this app - it is not appropriate for kids.  Targeted at &#60;10 years age and then tricks them.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|This is a little GEM of a movie!  Everything is great--the story, the cast, the acting, the dialogue and the music are wonderful.<br />Senior citizens, especially, should love it, as well as opera fans, although there isn't a lot of operatic singing, but the sound track is alive with familiar opera themes.  All in all, a very heartwarming and delightful treat.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|This is not an improvement. I liked the old style a lot better. Maybe I'll get used to it or maybe there is something better out there.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|After readimg some of the reviews, I agree with some, and dissagree with others. Yes you can tell he is not an author, but the story behind the whole book is amazing. I am training for the marines and this gave me a great inside view. it neither glorifies war, nor bashes everything about it. He gives both the positives and negitives. It may be due to the fact that I have looked into the topic my whole life, but his imput facinates me. On top of all of this, he is able to put some humor into the book as well. It is not a completely stone faced view on war. He is able to bring some humor into the book. The parts he puts jokes are appropriately funny while keeping the overall serious feel of the book the same.
B005QPMB2Y|1.0|I loaded the apps and the requested information the unit I have is listed but the the program will  not load up
