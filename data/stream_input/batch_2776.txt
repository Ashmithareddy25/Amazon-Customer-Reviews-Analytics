0785153942|5.0|Get the background to the Jaeger program and the beginnings of the Drift. Very, very cool. Beautifully illustrated with a compelling story.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I absolutely loved this story! I could definitely see this as a successful television series. The concept was unique and very well thought out. Juliette was such an engaging heroine. The author has a way of painting a very clear picture of life in the silos without forcing too much information on you. Very well written and very well edited. Hope to see more of this story soon!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Good entertainment, just silly however with exceptional voice talent.  Watched it with my teenaged daughters and husband and we all enjoyed it.
0544104404|5.0|Great overview and narrative exploring a neglected dimension in student academic achievement. Tough delivers engaging stories with provocative social science research to the reader.

B00DRPVE3M|3.0|If you love this game as it is. You well still love it you play with real ppl so it make it fun. Only thing u don't get to many tokens that's fast
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|This games is fun but it Is annoying on how you need tokens to play a game of uno. In the old uno app you were able to play as many times as you wanted without running out of tokens
B009KS4XRO|2.0|this app does not let a person play very many games before needing to pay money.  I do not pay extra to play apps on my Kindle.
B008MM9630|4.0|It is not filling. So it is not a very good game.<br />It is okay I mean it is not a mermaid games and all:-)
B008GOG98Y|5.0|A classic that the whole family can sit and watch together. This film never gets old or dated, highly recommend.
B009S33I68|5.0|I enjoyed the Mel Gibson movie based on this book, but found much more in the actual book.  If you liked the movie, read the book.  True heroes.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Would recommend it for parents with kids in middle school and for the kids themselves!  I learned about this book from Diane Savage at the Reading Bug in San Carlos.  It is a young adult book, but I enjoyed it a lot!

B0066W1AZK|5.0|I love it I've. used it a ton. Its really good and I think you should get it. Not a waste of space.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|This duo keeps getting better.  I can't get enough of SeeSaw.  I just love Beth's voice and I can say that she does justice to the classics.  I grew up with the music of Billy Holliday, Nina Simone, Sarah Vaughn, and listening to Beth brings back so many great memories.  I do disagree with Beth when she says that she doesn't have the issue of slavery in her background.  Maybe not slavery in the US, but as a member of the human race, she has slavery in her background; we all do.  It's a nasty, evil practice that humans inflict on each other.  She sings \\"Strange Fruit\\" from her heart and does it very well.<br /><br />I would love for Beth to cover more Aretha and Miss Etta.  Maybe some Mavis Staples, Sarah Vaughn, Ella Fitzgerald, or Della Reese.  Beth has a marvelous voice for old-time gospel and I'd welcome an album of gospel covers from her and Joe.  Not the recent inspirational songs, but gospel from the early to mid 1900s.  After all, gospel is at the heart of blues, jazz and R&B.  All music comes from the soul and Joe and Beth remind us of this with every new release.  So Miss Lady, you keep carrying on and I'm looking forward to the next album from you and Joe.  Maybe something from your recent EU mini tour?
159562015X|3.0|I bought this for me and one of my subordinates at work. We read it identified our strengths according to the book. It is an uplifting book and it worth the value. Great for gifts to employees you may supervise.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Absolutely loved this movie. Heartwarming without being mushy. Funny without being silly.  Predictable but I still wanted to watch it to the end and was not disappointed.  Great acting....I can't say enough about this film....you just have to see if for yourself.

B009LDD1X0|5.0|This is a show that I did not want to jump on the band wagon for since every time I had done so at the time with a show it was cancelled.  But then I ended up watching two episodes on TBS and fell in love laughing out loud.  The next few days after that I bout the first three seasons and was hooked.<br /><br />Not only is the show consistently funny it never lacks for heart and the characters are as engaging in the sixth season as the first.  Every new character has brought a greater depth to the series.<br /><br />if you want a show that never disappoints and can make a bad day good again I recommend The Big Bang Theory.<br /><br />Great characters, great friendships and a cast that I can say I would not change one of them the entire ensemble is wickedly talented.<br /><br />A rare gem in a world of reality TV and shows that often disappoint.<br /><br />This is a complete series must have, just pick your format.

B001N1DPDE|3.0|I just bought this knife, and I only have about 3 hours playing with it, but right now I feel let down.  The reviews are all so great.  This is a very thick, very heavy knife.  I don't know how I am going to use it.  It would be great for chopping, prying things up, and a few other task because it is so heavy duty.  It is good quality steel and good construction.  The problem is it is too big and thick for fine work.  I sharpened it and was happy with the edge, but this thing is built for chopping and brute force work, not fine work.  If you use it for brute force task it quickly loses its edge.  I am thinking of sharpening it with a metal file like I do my hatchets from now on.  That way I can quickly touch up the edge without a lot of work.  I don't know if I will carry this knife.  It is big, heavy, and limited to brute force task.  I would be better off with a hatchet or machete and a smaller knife.  I am on Amazon shopping for another knife right now because this one will not do what I want.<br /><br />I like the bottom part of the sheath.  It is a very nice plastic sheath but it attaches to a floppy nylon loop at the top.  This is so you can remove the loop and attach it to a pack or something.  That is great but for belt carry it looks strange.<br /><br />Update: I recently bought a Mora bushcraft knife [[ASIN:B009O01H0Y Morakniv Bushcraft Carbon Fixed Blade Knife with Sandvik Stainless Steel Blade, Black, 0.125/4.3-Inch]] and I like it a lot more.  Far sharper, better steel, and a hard edge on back for striking a ferrocerym rod or scraping. It is light weight and I am a light weight hiker.  In short I like it a lot more, but it is not going to take abuse like this knife.  I also have the cold steel thrower that is an excellent survival knife.  I am going to have to do a review on this knife soon. [[ASIN:B000BSY9AI Cold Steel True Flight Thrower Paracord Wrapped Handle (Sheath)]] The thrower has good steel, holds an edge, is a strong durable blade and it hasa thin light weight sheath that is real easy to carry. Consider this knife also.<br /><br />I used a file and find sand paper to remove the coating and put a sharp corner on the back of the knife.  I may remove it all eventually as I see no need for the black coating. The knife could not strike a spark from a ferrocerym rod without doing this.

B001NHNG64|4.0|Smooth and easy. Turn off your brain and enjoy. Precise, thoughtful and imaginative while being very entertaining. Dig that Jack.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I would like to thank Amazon the second time placing my order on back order as this will make ity harder for me to make excuses to sit in front of the TV.<br /><br />They are truly looking out for us and encouraging getting up and exercises by delaying the delivery of this item which would encourage people to spend more time in front of the TV.<br /><br />Also I it is nice to see Amazon supporting our economy by providing plenty of them to these people that are selling them for $80 and up.<br /><br />Keep up the good work and we will have a healthier population and strong economy.<br /><br />Ordered on July 25, placed on back order of July 26,  on Aug 3 given new delivery date of Aug 23, and today Aug 6 placed on back order again.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|can't stop playing this game.  All the kids and grandkids love it. it really fun to see how many flips you can do before you break a neck.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|tetris like puzzle game. fun and well made. the description isn't very good. wish radian games would bring their other games over to amazon.
B000V39KDO|2.0|I popped it in when I received it and I was a little disappointed by the way it looked. I was expecting more from a BluRay movie. I agree with some of the other comments about how grainy the movie is.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a great game! I enjoy the minions but it does get a little boring. I wish tokens were not so difficult to acquire.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|This was the best season by far.  The story line of the Trinity Killer was superb.  Very shocking last episode.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Love this game on my friend's iPad but it won't load onto my Kindle Fire even though it's downloaded. Uninstalled and redownloaded and still won't load to play.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I think that this is a great deal of all time favorite of all time high level in the first book
B00005UDV2|5.0|It has many aspects of life thamMany men and women go through who really only care about pwoer & money & satisfying their own needs. There are some sexual and violent scenes in this movie that are graphic in nature & should be watched ONLY by adults. All of the actors/actresses were terrific.
B00AKO93JK|5.0|Finally a workout that I can select the areas that I need to work on--not what a trainer or someone else wants me to do. Easy to understand and great visuals.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Good bye to HDMI cables!<br /><br />With Netflix offer this is a bargain deal.  A must buy from Google.  Able to cast any webpage from my acer chromebook.
055380684X|4.0|I am a high school math teacher and found the ideas in this book relevant to the skills I teach in the classroom.
1907563202|4.0|I've been crocheting for 35+ years, and bought this for my neice, who is just learning.  It is a good resource for the beginner, and the variety of projects in it make it a good pattern reference book.  It's definitely British--Most of us Yanks don't make tea cozies!  Maybe we should?  The one in here is really quite pretty.  The patterns and illustrations are well-done, and the photography is lovely.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|I'm a long time boggle,  Tetris,  puzzle game lover and was pleasantly surprised to find this faotd this morning.  Going to download for my wife's Amazon account tout de suite!  Can't argue with just one app permission either.
B004EPZ0H0|4.0|I found it a very interesting book, quite a different read to some books, but very informative<br />and on the whole well written
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Another captivating book! Can't wait to find out what happens next! I'm really curious about the scar on jaces neck and what the inquisitor said to him!
B0088W4YTK|5.0|We are a family of 5, kids ages ranging from 6 to 15. We all enjoy the humor and are not put off by the intensity levels of the action. This show keeps things pretty clean, without being sterile and boring. We are working our way through each season as fast as we can. We also liked BBC Merlin, BBC Robin Hood, and Star Trek The Next Generation. Funny though, we think the star of this show is most like Hans Solo.
0307730700|4.0|Like it, but cannot read it because of such small print.  I use reading glasses, but still find it too difficult to keep on reading such small print.  Should have ordered large print.  Perhaps I'll try a magnifying glass??  Is is available on Kindle?  Really would like to read it.  Alice
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It took me a few pages to get into the book, but once I did I couldn't put it down.  Hosseini is a great storyteller and I loved the way he wove the various characters together.  It was as well done as The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My grandson played this game for hours. Then we started learning to speak minion lol. This is a really fun game!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I bought it to share with students in an American Lit class, but have loaned it to family and friends and all give it rave reviews. My students loved it too. What is intriguing is to get a feel for the time period and to witness some of the players as they meet for the first time at the first Continental Congress. The film demonstrates the vast difference in Colonial times and our own contemporary world, especially in lack of scientific methods in medicine and lack of technology for convenience and communication in everyday life that we take for granted in modernity.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|I don't get it...<br /><br />The military is bombing this huge monster... They're shooting every kind of missile in the world at it.  You see tanks shooting at the monster, you see jets shooting at the monster... All weapons in the USA arsenal aside from an atom bomb are used to destroy this monster....<br />And the monster just keeps going, it doesn't die....?  Ok... Why?....<br /><br />That's the biggest problem I have with this movie.  Nevermind that the monster came out of no where (in the ocean?  How would it have anything to eat?  What is it eating?  blues whales?)  or outer space... (Too many problems to even tackle that possibility) ... These are problems with the movie that I can ignore and overlook.  But asking me to ignore how and why the monster hasn't died is asking too much.... It makes no sense.... The monster is a flesh and blood creature.  I bet if you had a handgun you could literally kill a T-rex if you found yourself in some Jurassic Park world.  All a bullet has to do is hit an artery... That's it, it doesn't matter how big the animal is.  The monster not dying made no sense... Was it suppose to be immortal?  There are too many unrealistic possibilities the movie makers expect us to accept.  Asking me to believe a huge monster just walked out of the ocean Godzilla style is asking me to suspend my belief a lot... Asking me to believe it's immortal as well, is asking too much.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|THIS IS LIKE HEAVEN!!! For all of you who LOVE Despicable Me and the minions,this is YOUR game! This game is fun,funny,addictive just a great game for kids and teens and parents and senior citizens.It's great for anyone!!!! Amazing for anyone!!! I RECOMMEND THIS FOR EVERYONE!!!!! 5 STARS FOR SURE!!! GET IT NOW!!! :D
B0042X9L6A|5.0|This flash has been everything I expected, and I am very pleased with it. Battery life could be better, with moderate use I've had to change them out after a week. That really is a minor issue though. I would definitely recommend this flash.
1452115567|3.0|I was &#34;under&#34; whelmed with the &#34;quality&#34; of the pictures--the book was based on a fun and cute idea-just wish pictures were a bit more professional in quality.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|It knows even the most obscure songs. I love it when I'm in the car listening to the radio station because it helps me identify songs that I go home and purchase.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|We make many choices on emotion alone and later regret most of them. The most important thing is we gain experience and hopefully change our perceptions of closeness and most important love.
B004GXZ69W|5.0|This thing is awesome! I definitely feel less wrist pain! Does take awhile to get used to though. And amazing is making me add more words to this thing...
0740748475|4.0|This is the definitive collection which all core CnH fans should have. It is a delight to read and re-read this 3 hardbound volumes from the master - Bill Watterson (RIP)<br /><br />And thanks to Amazon for delivering this from the US to India...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My 9 year old also likes it.<br /><br />We both find it challenging and enjoy playing together. There does appear to be a slight disconnect in the flow of the clues at times - but other than that we quite enjoy it.
B0012GMW0C|5.0|Great progressive rock n roll for the 70's. The pre-Steve era where they really jammed before forgotten about and replaced with a different sound. This a Great album/CD to add to any collection. Not many people know about this little jem...
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Something about her writing has a way of making you never want to put the book down & that is exactly what happened with me.I read the book in one whole day & loved it.The only thing I would say is the character Anastasia has some dramatic repetitive actions that get annoying sometimes.Overall it was a good read 4 the genre it is in.
B000062X90|4.0|I wish I had access to their music way back then. It is great that it is easier to access a larger variety of music now a days...
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Not disappointed at all. Like a continuation of their last album with Layne. I must own for any serious fan.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is awesome I like the whole concept of the game but a lot of stuff is pricey  and if you have every person on it try not to let someone rest the defaults like my sister did
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love it!<br />Trying to collect all the items keeps you coming back for more.<br />Fun and addictive. Give it a try.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Last minute camping trip and no flashlight - what to do?  Check out the App Store and downloaded this app.  Nice, bright LED light that showed the way.
B009AP2G26|5.0|I am 3/4 of the way through season 4 and it is all I can do to stop watching and go to work !  It is my favorite season, although I loved 1, 2, and 3 too. I highly rec. season 4 to everyone who loves Glee and it would also be enjoyable to people who have not yet watched Glee.  Great stories, music, dancing - great actors, it is just enjoyable on all levels.
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|This album is awesome!!!!!! The best album def leppard has ever came out with!!!!! Highly recommend this album!!! The b sides are awesome too!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is seriously addicting. It has fun missions as well as goals. The power-up are also a lot of fun.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's like u actually have a horse. I love it,it is so much fun. It will keep u intertaned for hours. There is always something new to do.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Love this show. Dexter always keeps the story moving. Makes me want more. Already looking forward to the next and final season.
B0095VPBM2|5.0|It's rare in life that such a solid investment presents itself.<br /><br />For a HTPC, or a gpu mining rig, whatever, this cpu is the right price, and doesn't get hot. It is silent with the stock fan and heatsink.<br /><br />That's all for a package under $60. Latest low power tech. Including great video, and it knows how to channel cycles to gpu or cpu as needed for best results. It's a very practical, low heat, low watts choice that will serve for many years to come, and still have resale value.<br /><br />If only everything were so obvious in life. I paired this with a uATX MSI board for about $50. That's just incredible value. USB 3.0, SATA 3, video, audio, everything but memory, case, psu and a hard drive.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It is hard not to like this book... it is well written, well thought-out and has that rare ability to make extreme fiction seem plausible in the real-world.<br /><br />I read this book right after it came out years ago and have gifted probably a dozen or more copies to friends along with the statement of: &#34;No, really... it isn't some cheesy horror story&#34;.  But I felt I should re-read it after I gave my wife a copy to read some months back...  (by the way, she is VERY anti-horror, anti-science fiction, etc.. so it took some convincing for her to pick it up)...<br /><br />...and she ended up loving it!<br /><br />She, (like most of the folks I've given it to), said that she kept wanting to write things down that were in the book because they were so insightful or just plain interesting... (THIS from a cheesy &#34;Zombie Book&#34;?... you're kidding me...).  She completely fell into the world that was created by the author with little effort needed to suspend disbelief.<br /><br />Ok... enough of the self-absorbed pontificating...  Here is the low down on this book if you are trying to decide to buy it:<br /><br />Just go ahead and buy it.<br /><br />If you are even considering it, you won't be disappointed... and if you are thinking of giving it as a gift to someone that &#34;may&#34; like &#34;that kind of book&#34;... definitely do it... they (and you) will be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Oh... and one last thing that I probably don't need to tell you... DON'T judge it by the movie... the movie was &#34;not bad&#34; despite the fact that it was almost totally unrelated to the book... (I know, not much of a surprise there, eh?)...  but, as is the norm for blockbusters with costly effects and actors... it was little more than a one-dimensional series of scenes stitched together to create emotional reactions... (which it did fairly well).<br /><br />But, believe me, this book has MUCH more depth in every way possible... characters, plots, supporting science, you name it...  (and you won't have the ardent desire to hold down Brad Pitt and wash his hair...  (ick)...  ;-)ou name it...  (and you won't have the ardent desire to hold down Brad Pitt and wash his hair...  (ick)...  ;-)
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|When Neil Gaiman writes, I simply can't help but get completely & totally lost in the world that he creates & this book is no exception. He is endlessly creative in a way that, while far-fetched, also seems believable in the bed time story way that just begs you to take his hand & go along for the journey.<br /><br />That said, this is not my favorite Gaiman story & yet I still found myself enjoying it & the journey of the characters. I enjoyed the Hempstocks, (who I'm certain must be related to the Graveyard Book's Liza & Stardust's Daisy) & of course our main character- the boy- & his insight into the world. It was the ending that I got hung up on, though I can't reveal too much without giving it away. I can only say that I felt exactly the way I think I was supposed to feel at the end- just like the main character.
B002SW8Y2E|5.0|The story is great! The author did a great job in walking you slowly through everything, yet keeping you interested at the same time, always wanting to know more.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book was so well done I'm blown away. PAM HIT EVERY POINT on manifesting made tangible. I'm reading it again to make sure I never forget! My life and mindset have improved immensely after reading this!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|The story is so interesting, and the idea behind it is fantastic. There were moments during which I wished my subway ride would never stop just so I could keep reading. That being said, there were also moments during which I did quick reads, as I felt things got a little slower. However, the book was great.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|Came fast Perfect size! Making a Duplo block table for my grand daughter just like I did for her mother. It will be well used.
B005LAIISA|4.0|Who can help but love this crew. Have them all. Always funny but, love that it shows sticking up for your friends and family while reaching out to help others too.
B00181JGI2|5.0|pure joy -- what can i say that hasn't been said already??<br /><br />Amazing cast - insane dialogue -- its alchemy
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is a lot of fun and I really enjoyed it. I can't stop playing and highly recommend it.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|I was a little annoyed by the fact that the description and the pictures really didn't tell you anything about the game.<br /><br />Essentially this is a strategic puzzle game where you try to clear rows of cubes that appear after each move  you make.  You are allowed to move almost any piece on any row (including the row of cubes that are about to drop from the top).  The pieces drop and then any completed rows are removed.  The nice thing is that this gives you time to think about your move and you pieces don't drop as time goes by.  This is really a game me of strategy so TAKE YOUR TIME.  As you progress there are blocks that rise from the bottom, immovable blocks, magnetic blocks, etc.<br /><br />Overall I think this is a pretty good game.  After playing it for about 5 minutes I don't know how much replay value this will have but if you like tetris-like games, give it a try.  I didn't get a far in the game but it was mainly because I didn't spend enough time planning my moves.  I will definitely give it a few more times to see if I can get better then level 4 that I for on my first attempt.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I like this game very much. It's relaxing but also challenging. Very nice settings. Very colorful. Really enjoy playing this game.
B00005JLCI|5.0|This is the only Hamlet film that matters. Full of life and color, and boasting probably the best collection of actors ever assembled for one film, Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet gets better with every viewing. I saw it once in the theater and once on VHS, and 15 years later I have found great new insights into the Danish prince, not only because of Shakespeare's writing, but due to Branagh's direction.
B0001HLVS2|3.0|I am an avid Russell Crowe fan, and this movie was pretty good. I don't think it was Russell, or the plot, but me. I am so used to seeing him in more dramatic roles, that maybe I lost the meaning of the movie
B006DJ2JSI|2.0|This dictionary looked good but the audio feedback on word pronunciation is muffled and unintelligible.  I tried reloading app. Still doesn't work. Disappointing.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. Secretariat was a great athlete, truly at the top of his game and I am so glad that Disney was able to tell this magnificent story. I felt every emotion, frustration, challenge that Penny faced and during that time in history, woman were expected to know their place, stay in it, raise the children, keep the house, support the husband and his career. Penny was faced with so much opposition, and she and Secretariat overcame all the obstacles. God is the master of all the universe.
1574214276|5.0|I gave one as a gift to my niece for Christmas and when my mother looked through it she decided that she needed a copy and another for a friend. Gift giving success!
B003HGKJH8|5.0|My first introduction to these guys was their sophomore album Lonerism with the track \\"Gotta Be Above It.\\" My initial reaction was that \\"Oh cool, they're sampling John Lennon stuff I never heard. No, this is what songwriter and Tame Impala's heavly lifting frontman Kevin Parker sings exactly like. So much so that my first listens of these 2 albums were hampered because of it's distraction. After the second time around you just learn to love the Lennon-esque feel.<br /><br />From start to finish this album is great. They though out basic verse, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus structure of most songs and present a beautiful soundscape with catchy lyrics bass lines and riffs. Kenvin did very will to layer many sounds of this album, sweeping phasers, dreamy synths, and echos background vocals gives this album an amazing 60's psychedelic feel beyond anything we've ever got from the 60's. To say this band has a lot of respect for sound and did well to show it would be a vast understatement.<br /><br />Though there were a couple of down spots like Jeremy's Storm I thought could be elaborated more, it still ended up as a nice piece overall and more than made up for by tracks like Lucidity, It's Not Meant To Be, and Make Up Your Mind. Overall this is one of my new favorite albums of all time. I simply have a hard time putting this band down.

B0000028RR|5.0|This album is the best Rage album out there (in my humble opinion). It is also easily my favorite rock/rap albums (I mean the combination of the two, rather than as two separate categories). Amazing how music so conscious and aware can also be so dynamic and powerful. This one album paved the way for the resurgence of the rock/rap, or rap/metal (whatever you want to call it genre in the 90s and beyond.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's so cute and fun for kids.<br />It's the game of the month.<br />This is my favorite game and my brother agrees
B0029LHW4U|3.0|I know everyone else seems to be ga-ga over this album. I've been trying on-and-off for a couple of years to let it grow on me, but unfortunately it doesn't have the same soul & passion without Layne on the vocals. It just seems kinda flat and stale. It's okay...but haven't had a strong desire to keep listening to it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really fun I play it all the time. Really good graphics . Best app game loft app ever made.you have to get really fun
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|Oh man. Hard to describe how good this album is. I didn't discover it until way after Layne Staley left this world. I randomly came across it and thought, 'what the heck,' I'll see if this is any good. Blew me away. Wow. While it involves members of Alice in Chains, and Pearl Jam and I forget who else, it's sound is totally original and unique - completely unlike any of the members' other bands. It's rugged and raw, soulful and sweet, bitter and sad...and oh so powerful. Worth purchasing.<br /><br />Now, just a side note, this review is for the first 10 songs of the original Mad Season album. The last few songs have a different singer and you might as well not listen to them because they aren't part of the actual album (they're \\"new\\" \\"bonus tracks\\" or whatever, with a different singer). Those last few songs sound like a totally different group - one that's not very good, as the soulful sound of Layne Staley's vocals have been replaced by the bored & tired singing of someone else. Anyway, my 5 stars is for those first 10, original songs on this album. The others don't really deserve to be considered part of it.
B001U1V3RW|5.0|This deck of cards is awesome. Great coloring and feels just as good as the originals. With the added cards for easy, on the go magic, makes this a whole lot better.
B000002GJH|5.0|Hard to even describe how good this album is. Chris Cornell before the meteoric rise of Soundgarden. Eddie Vedder before Pearl Jam even existed...and the rest - all awesome future Pearl Jam members who would eventually influence the course of rock history. And this little album, a gem in the early 90s rock scene. Full of soul, spit, grit, angst & moan. Deep & spiritual while gritty and street. The light & dark of life all packaged into these few delicious songs. Bought it. Live it. Love it. Peace.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|This game realy makes you really think.  I like playing it but I can't put it down. My kindle shuts down before I am done playing.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|No need to share the synopsis or write a detailed review. There are many of those up already. I just want to say this is an incredible documentary, and very worth watching. My only disappointment was that I wished they had discussed more frankly some of the seemingly obvious reasons why his music wasn't promoted back when he wrote & recorded them. Seems like the record companies didn't think America was ready for a Mexican American to be singing such anti-establishment songs. Seems like an obvious reason to me. No other explanation makes sense!<br /><br />Anyway, loved it!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|this a great game that I can not stop playing. I am addicted and will buy the full version. awesome
B000000WJZ|5.0|This album is one of my all-time favorite albums. Extremely powerful & dynamic. Angry & hopeful, vulnerable and desperate, gritty and beautiful. One of the few albums that helped me through some very dark times. By far my favorite Smashing Pumpkins albums. There are songs on here I love, yet even better than any individual song is the composition of the whole album. Good for road trips - or on some other un-interrupted period of time in which you can get the full effect of its dramatic & powerful ups and downs.
B002NANLCE|4.0|I had hoped it was along the lines of the TV show, but it turned out this was a much more fulfilling story.
B00D5YNQWM|5.0|You can't even tell this wasn't intended to be a film. The director (Casey Tebo) did such a great job with cameras and footage it's unbelievable! He did a wonderful job with what he had available! You can see the band is in their best time, they look smokin' and you can tell they are having fun up in stage!<br /><br />The song selection, I think is the best thing about this film. Unlike other works of this kind that focus on hits and ballads, Casey focused on deep cuts, rockers: EXACTLY WHAT US, HARDCORE FANS, WERE WAITING. Dream On, isn't on the setlist (my favorite song) but guess what, I don't care, and I must admit you have to have balls to do that, so I applaud you for that Casey! Best part, is you can tell Casey knows the band, knows the songs and he focuses on right moments to make close ups to certain band members, guitar parts, drums, etc. One thing I love, is how natural the whole film is, since they weren't aware this was going to have this kind of use, you can see flaws and that makes it beautiful and unique.<br /><br />Before watching the movie, I read lots of comments from people complaining about the song \\"cuts\\", I'm gonna have to disagree with these kind of comments by saying I don't think they are \\"cuts\\", first of all this is a CONCERT FILM, so it is ok to do this \\"fadings\\" (I rather call them that way). I personally think it's really nice to see how they rehearse \\"Hangman Jury\\" right on the dressing room, after not playing it since what it feels like FOREVER, and not just the final product live on concert, YOU CAN FIND THAT ON YOUTUBE, right? And besides, you could complain about that if it was a Live DVD in which of course you won't find this stuff. Same with those complains about why using the footage of different shows and not just one. There was a story behind this film.<br /><br />AND PLEASE, STOP SAYING THE FILM IS THE SAME \\"MISTAKE\\" AS YGM, PLEASE. JUST, NO.<br /><br />As for the emotional side, this film brought so many different emotions to me. I felt really moved and touched by the fans and the things they said. I could see myself in many of them, and I loved the fact they were involved in the movie. To be able to see how the band brought peace and joy, to a country that was devastated in sadness and fear, felt my heart deeply and it proved me once again WHY I am a fan to this amazing rockband and WHY I have devoted my life to it. Im proud to say Aerosmith is MY PASSION.<br /><br />To finish, Casey did a great job! Quality of picture and audio is insane. I cant wait to see more of his work with the band. Hopefully new concert films from places they have been and where they are really loved as well LIKE SOUTHAMERICA ;) you've got pretty good hardcore fans down here, and we would love to share our experiences too!<br /><br />As a suggestion (cause no one has the right to tell Casey how to do his job) is maybe if possible in future materials add more songs, or interviews as bonus. Nothing more, I deeply admire his work, I've seen him working live with my own eyes and think he is the ONE for this! Can't think of another person.<br /><br />So, THANK YOU CASEY and looking forward for more!<br /><br />Giuliana J.<br /><br />ps. sorry for any grammatical or orthography mistakes I'm ecuadorian but I tried to do my best!o me.

B00006F7IM|5.0|Bob Uecker, baseball and fun! Very funny film. Very good cast. Lots of gags and lines. Weird characters and &#34;The Wild Thing&#34;!

B000P0J09M|5.0|Another great film from Marty! DeNiro, Pesci and Liotta...a great trio. This film has it all. The NY mob in a really true story.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|This game put a fun twist on a tetris style strategy game. You can't play this game like you do tetris,for those of you complaining,think out of the box! The tutorial was very helpful and easy to follow! Check it out. Challenging and entertaining!
B000M341QE|5.0|Great cast! Great story! Great film! Academy award! What ele is there to say? THis man makes great films! Perfect!
B0085TKAW6|4.0|A wonderful way of understanding our history; both the good and the bad. Follets characters as always are so vivid.
B0009HLD0K|5.0|Love this film. Great young cast and some great vets too. Great story. Fun film. Young man growing up along with his friends.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|it's a nice game, but it's too expensive to buy the characters and stuff. I like other game similar to this better!!!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book was really good, really shows you what those guys go through to defend our country.  If you had read Lone Survivior, you will really like this book.  This book touches on some of the events from Lone Survivor.
0770437400|5.0|I was worried about what I would get in the package when this shipment came in, but I am very pleased with the results. Everything in the box was unique, the book was packaged very securely, no dents or scratches on the book, first thing I saw was the Certificate of Authentication of where it was signed by Max Brooks, and the certificate and book were packaged together neatly. I also noticed that the book was a bit larger than the new cover book of WWZ that was mass marketed, but it had the same thickness. I hope to read the signed book to see if there are any differences; most likely not, but I'll enjoy reading the book again.
0375842209|5.0|I enjoyed the book and will look into reading another Markus Zusak 's book. His style was a bit of a surprise but enjoyable.
B005K15XR4|5.0|Fantastic cd though not quite as impressive as Skyworld or Archangel, but then those 2 are awfully hard to beat. Highly recommend this to Two Steps From Hell fans and anyone who loves epic power move trailer-type music.
B008CPZNL6|2.0|Love this app on android and ios phones but it doesn't work any longer on my kindle. Tried uninstalling and didn't help.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Not lame at all. It's super sweet to the max! Can't wait for the next EPiC chapter to blow my mind into fractal specks of time and space......taco
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Excellent sharpener when it works... I bought eight of this for me and some relatives. Only 1 of this sharpeners didn't work at all. The rest worked just fine!!
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|A great book on a great movie. Nice attention to detail. All the stories were fresh. I hope to read more by this author.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Very cool game, awesome graphics, kept me occupied for a couple days. Wish it was longer. Can't wait till next one!!!
B00509ODFO|5.0|Dear Mr. Bezos:<br />Quit buying newspapers and bring back SGU! (I realize it's your own money but have a heart).<br />SGU was the last of the Star Gate series I tried because it frankly did not appear at first glance to be worth the time. I was wrong. I think it's the best. Less comic book like the original and more thoughtful. The acting was very good and more nuanced than the others- Robert Carlyle had a great character and did an outstanding job with it. The story line was more interesting. I am getting set to watch the last episode right now and am a bit bummed out at what it means- no more...
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A really enjoyable read, with an interesting concept and compelling characters.<br /><br />Howey's storytelling skills are engaging, simple and direct. He hooks the reader anew with every event and character introduced, until it's impossible to put the book down. Definitely worth reading.<br /><br />The missing 5th star in this review is due to some problems of inconsistency, which strained my suspension of disbelief. The most obvious one to me was...<br /><br />SPOILER AHEAD--<br /><br />The temperature in the silo, which decreased with increasing depth. This is straight-out false, since the geothermal gradient rises with increasing depth, which means the deeper you go, the hotter and damper it gets. The silo has 134 levels; assuming each level is at least 8 ft tall, that makes for a silo depth of at least 1072 ft, and that means the surrounding temperature at the lowest levels is at least 46° F warmer than at the surface. Every time I read about Juliette shivering in the deeper levels, and worrying about hypothermia (not to mention the 'freezing' water she dived into) I just couldn't empathize with her anymore.<br /><br />Also, the silo would have problems with the heat their machines and servers produced, since there is no considerable cooling effect from the surrounding earth. The temperatures in the lower levels of Mechanical with their gigantic generators, drills and pumps would be tropical, creating the imperative need of vents toward the surface, which---given the toxicity of the atmosphere hailed as absolutely deadly---would be highly problematic. At the very least, there would need to be an elaborate cooling system heading laterally out of the silo's upper levels, cooling the air by circulating it through the cooler upper ground. But if that would be enough to counteract the heat produced by hundreds of machines and thousands of people and animals remains questionable.<br /><br />There are a few more minor glitches and questionable aspects in worldbuilding logic, but they did not distract me from the riveting story as much as this one, and I see no use in pointing them out, since the story worked well *despite* them.<br /><br />--SPOILER END<br /><br />All in all, WOOL is a great read, and a good example of the fact that indie science-fiction harbors valuable gems beneath the muck of the masses.<br /><br />Go buy it and have an underground adventure.<br /><br />It's worth it.g logic, but they did not distract me from the riveting story as much as this one, and I see no use in pointing them out, since the story worked well *despite* them.<br /><br />--SPOILER END<br /><br />All in all, WOOL is a great read, and a good example of the fact that indie science-fiction harbors valuable gems beneath the muck of the masses.<br /><br />Go buy it and have an underground adventure.<br /><br />It's worth it.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|this movie is a story of careers made in sound city and how its more of a &#34;bringing the band together&#34; experience than you would get in any digital sudio, it's also where real talent is.
0440246318|5.0|I realized reading this book that it is Live Schreiber that should have been tapped to play Reacher.  This book is a non-stop read tht will keep you turning pages into the night.  This is an amazing series of books.
B00CRR5YA0|3.0|One thing we look for in Star Trek films is something fresh and inspiring. Michael Giacchino did a fine job in the first reboot film (does anyone actually call it The Motion Picture?). It didn't *feel* like he had a lot of new material here. Few tracks stick in my mind. I did enjoy &#34;London Calling.&#34; &#34;Warp Core Values&#34; and &#34;Buying the Space Farm&#34; would have been more memorable had their scenes not been a rescipting of the Engine Room scenes from ST:WoK. Better luck next film.
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|Three terrific seasons, each about 4 hrs.  They really work best when watched in 4 hr. sessions as the mysteries and intrigues build in a way that you don't want to set it aside even for a day.  It is a very nasty world portrayed here and I hope it is not even a remotely true portrayal of the UK political system.  I is really the down and dirty version of THE THICH OF IT and IN THE LOOP which played the same world for laughs.  But this is top flight in every way and I can see why Netflix chose to Americanize it.  I can't imagine the US version is any better than this.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|This album is a treasure of in both poetry and music. written in a time of great upheaval in south africa, These artist just kept on keeping on creating and lighting the way forward.  Excellent!
B00C81AVNU|3.0|These are perfectly radio-worthy songs but Cindy is no Sondheim (or Lloyd Weber, for that matter).  The movie is fun and I expect I will enjoy the show but the score hardly merits re-listening.  This should NOT have beaten Matilda for Best Score.
020530902X|4.0|This is an authoritative reference book. It is small enough to be accessible and comprehensive enough to be valuable. Any writer could benefit from having it to hand, any time they are writing.

B008TRUDAS|4.0|Slammed, wow, this was incredible.<br />This book is about Layken and her family moving to Michigan. Her father died several months ago, and she believes they had to move because of money. Now as soon as they get there her brother finds a friend next door, and his older brother has eyes for Layken.<br /><br />Will, the 21-year old next door neighbor, sees Layken and knows he wants her. They end up going out one night, but soon things end up pulling them apart. Along the way Layken has to learn a whole lot about life, love, and death. She realizes they she has a lot to learn, and a lot to be thankful for even though she also has a lot of heartache ahead.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. It is really good. The only downside was Layken, at times acted really immature. It drove me nuts. I sometimes understood her thinking, but then sometimes I just wanted to slap her. Then towards the end Will does something that really bothered me. I really thought he was a jerk for some of those things he did. Overall this book was awesome. One of my favorites, and I highly recommend. Now on to the next on in this series!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I read this again in preparation for the movie, and its even better then I remember it! I have been amazed as I have read The Mortal Instruments, Infernal Devices, and the Bane Chronicals at the intricate stories and character development, a must read!
B001P9KR94|5.0|Bought this for my daughter.  She had seen this movie and really liked it.  She is happy to have it.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I loved the twists in the plot of this book.  It jumped around between three different time periods but the author made it very easy to follow.  It was hard to put this book down!
B0053O89U6|5.0|who doesn't love gloria?? I just wish they didn't wait so long to comeout with the next season. I love it!
B00C9PQ7I8|5.0|Ms. Staples sings with heart and soul, and there is an ease and friendliness to her vocal styling and the instrumentals that cheer me while I work
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Easy to use. I love the fact that it holds a history so you can go back and view calculations.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I loved books 1 & 2 of this series but this book was tedious and boring compared to them.  It lacked substance and was drawn out unnecessarily. It felt like a 'filler' book whilst waiting for the next book to actually deliver on the story. I wish the author had stuck to her trilogy as planned and not stretched this series beyond the third book.  I also couldn't connect with the characters this time around as the story felt flat and monotonous. I had to force myself to keep reading and finish the book in the hope it would get better, but sadly it didn't. I don't expect I'll buy the next book. Sorry Sylvia Day, but you've lost a fan.
B008RXYOKY|4.0|pretty standard adapter. decent build. I kind of wish it clicked in, but it slips out pretty easily. just happy to be using the port
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a real fun and entertaining game for all ages. I like that it's hard enough but not too hard.
B00005JLD4|4.0|For over a century Great Britain enforced a misguided social policy that removed half-caste Aboriginal children from their mothers and placed them in orphanages where they were taught \\"their place.\\" They became gardeners, housekeepers, cooks, maids and chauffeurs while their families mourned their absence. You will be gratified to know that this policy was abandoned by 1970 but it's shocking to know how long it had been in effect.<br /><br />In 1931, three aboriginal girls were snatched from their homes and placed in one such school. This movie is a dramatized account of their escape and subsequent attempt to cross the continent in order to rejoin their families.<br /><br />Not only is this story exciting, in the extras on this PG-rated, 94-minute award winner, we are given the privilege of meeting the actual women, now very elderly.<br /><br />Playing real people, we see:<br />  * Everlyn Sampi as Molly Craig;<br />  * Tianna Sansbury as Daisy Craig Kadibill;<br />  * Laura Monaghan as Gracie Fields;<br />  * Jason Clarke as Constable Riggs;<br />  * Kenneth Branaugh as A. O. Neville; and<br />  * David Gulpilil as Moodoo the tracker.<br /><br />This is a seat-of-the-pants thriller, a comedy, a social commentary, a tear-jerker and a feel-good drama. Who could ask for anything more? (I got my DVD from Amazon.)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you have kids this is the one for you. Great family game taking turns and laughing the whole time.
B00BEIYMZ6|5.0|Here's a great idea: Create a fake family to smuggle a large amount of pot from Mexico in their family RV. No one would suspect THEM! And these poor simpletons end up with enough marijuana in their vehicle to kill Willie Nelson.<br /><br />This is one of the funniest (and most profanely vulgar) movies I have seen in a long time. Yes, it's predictable but we were surprised and delighted at every twist and turn along the way. Director Rawson Marshall Thurber (\\"Dodgeball\\") made each actor genuinely attractive. I have never found Sudeikis or Aniston so appealing, while Roberts impressed me with her comic timing, and Poulter is in a league of his own.<br /><br />Here are the amateurs (and the professionals):<br />  * Jason Sudeikis (\\"Horrible Bosses\\") is an amateur smuggler; in real life he's a low-end pot dealer, a holdover from his college days.<br />  * Jennifer Aniston (\\"Wanderlust\\") is an amateur smuggler; in real life she's a professional stripper. The choreography for her dance is clever.<br />  * Emma Roberts (\\"Hotel for Dogs\\") is an amateur smuggler; in real life she's a street kid who robs newspaper vending machines.<br />  * Will Poulter (\\"Son of Rambow\\") is an amateur smuggler, in real life he's a dorky student whose mom left for groceries ...last Tuesday. (This actor is British!)<br />  * Ed Helms (\\"The Hangover\\") is a professional drug kingpin who isn't above a \\"smidge\\" of lying and cheating. He's so rich he bought an orca, just because he could.<br />  * Nick Offerman (Lots of TV) is a vacationer in a huge RV just like the one our \\"family\\" uses.<br />  * Kathryn Hahn (Lots of TV) is his wife.<br />  * Luis Guzmán (\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\") is a federale who is just looking for a bribe...sorta...<br /><br />This silly (but funny) set-up has some deplorable moments with blink-and-you'll-miss-it male nudity, crass humor, lots of profanity, two or three gunshots, no blowie uppie stuff, and a laugh a minute.  Oh...and a tarantula!<br /><br />I've signed upto be notified by Amazon when this is available on DVD.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I enjoyed the hidden objects.  The dialog was a bit much until I found the skip button.  The scrambled words were challenging.  I had to stop at chapter 18 because of a bug in the game
B002ZG997M|5.0|I highly recommend this film to anyone. It's a post-apocalyptic film with Denzel Washington. What else could make this such a great movie?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun the characters are so funny. Also the movie was the bom. I had downloaded this game on my phone when it first came out. Then when started to put it on the kindle fire I downloaded right away. But ya you should download it.:0)
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|I won't be saying anything new, when I say Tom Sellecks does an amazing job of acting. The plot was interesting: a married couple that enjoyed murdering together. But like everyone else I like the characters, the plot, the acting. Great job.
0156027321|5.0|I loved this book! I read it when it first came out and I reread it again before I saw the movie. I enjoyed it both times, possibly even more the second time round. What made it such an amazing read? It is an unforgettable story about life and death. And oh, it features a Bengal Tiger too. It is a wonderful crafted tale that will make you laugh and cry. I know I did.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|Absolutely wonderful show! It is so refreshing to have such strong female leads and the acting from Anna Silk, Zoie Palmer and Ksenia Solo is top class. The show brings a wonderful mix of Humour and drama and for a low budget show does and amazing job with set's.<br />The best part of the show is the amazing chemistry between Anna Silk (Bo) and Zoie Palmer (Lauren) and I would say one of the best portrayals of a female to female relationship. It has created a massive following with a very loyal fandom dedicated to their relationship.
B0054W4JQK|4.0|I bought this on kindle on a whim. It had a strong start and I was really drawn in as a reader. It started off as some type of tense psychology thriller combined with mystery. I was hoping that the book could maintain the level of suspense. However, as the story progresses, around the last quarter of the book, things started to go downhill. You could see what is coming so the ending felt like a bit of a let down. All in all though, still a good and easy read!
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|This movie is awesome. I have never read the books before so I don't really know this character. but I will say this tom cruise was an excellent choice for the role. and just adding Robert duvall in it well they outdid themselves. these two are excellent actors. I thought the story was pretty good. I haven't seen a decent detective movie in a long time. I hope they make another one. now that I've seen the movie I gotta read the books. I thought that all the actors did a great job. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B003X27L9U|4.0|I wanted to read the book but I was also unsure about it. I didn't know how I was going to react to an adult story about harrowing and cruel things and it being narrated by a 5-year-old. But I am glad I did. I could not put the book down! It is dark and gripping read. It is also heart breaking and poignant. I loved the narration from the viewpoint of 5 year old Jack, though the narration will also likely divide readers - love it or hate. I have to say, it reminded me a little of that Italian Film \\"Life is Beautiful\\" with Roberto Benigni. And yes, I loved both!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am not a great writer of reviews but I read a dozen books a month and this is an awesome series, It is also quite scary because so much of the story seems like a plausible outcome of the US.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Small package and seems work OK. The serrated edge part is not what I expected. But usable for the price.
B000EAT246|4.0|I enjoyed the movie very much the first time I saw it. I had to buy it when I was able to.
B004VD3YIM|1.0|I tried the free version and it worked okay.  I needed the audio ability and purchased the PRO version.  I have tried for several hours to get it to work.  I have to keep entering all the information and it still won't work.  A message keeps popping up with, \\"Tinycam PRO has stopped working,\\" which is ironical since it never worked to begin with.  I have tried to search the internet for troubleshooting ideas but apparently there is no technical support.  It looked like it was a great app, but it is worthless to me.  Wish I knew how all the other reviewers got theirs to work. :(
B001NLKT60|5.0|Well written kept me stuck for three days. Look forward to reading the finale. STIEG LARSSON gives new meaning to a verbal twist.
1400069289|5.0|I'm re-reading this book and have recommended it to many people. It's a well-written, fascinating dissection of how habits work and can possibly be altered to help you manage your life more effectively.<br /><br />I've noticed that I utilize &#34;keystone habits&#34; such as exercising, that lead to improvements in my eating habits as well.<br /><br />Easy read, entertaining anecdotes about Starbucks, ALCOA, and others.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|It makes you lough, it makes you cry and it will change your life.<br />Definitely much better than the 14th century. Aha, and you will be much more careful about team-buildings.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|.I like it better than the earlier games.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />.<br />.I love it, know I will be hooked soon....I think I already am hooked.<br />.<br />....gggggoooooood games......................
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was a very good read ! I found it hard to put down! The passion between  Eva and Gideon was intense and flaming with erotic scenes . The descriptions of the characters were deep and this has a great story line that keeps drawing you in farther and farther. I can't wait to read the next one!
B002QYNIHU|5.0|Super pose able the and the sculpt is great SH Figuarts is doing a great job with these figures keep em coming!
B002LCCNW8|5.0|I am a huge arctic monkeys fan. I bought this album and was surprised by the composing and initially I thought shower pace. now it's my favorite album of theirs. Let it play and its classic a.m. lyrics. This album is more mature and it keeps the best parts of their musical talents and combines them with their evolving growth as a band. I love every song on this album but cornerstone is my favorite. Let it play you won't be disappointed.
B0049J0DC8|5.0|it was so funny i laughed my butt off it is a must see again and again great job !
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Most calculators are not easy to use but this one takes the cake with awesome backgrounds &amp; handling to match this is the BEST calculator  for kindle !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a really addictive game. I play it almost every day. If I could give it 100+ stars I would!
B007FIY3VW|1.0|It is a very very very very very bad app it will delete you work that is not saved or if you move it you will get an error box thing that you have to click than you have to do some other thing just to get back to the document. but besides that it okay. I would not have given it a star at all if i could.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|It's awesome, very fun, and addicting! Sometimes it glitches out ans you lose tokens but other than that, its pretty good!
1401307787|5.0|Life changing , great read if your new to the idea of meditation this is a road map of how to get there , should be required reading in jr high !
B009DCOU9S|3.0|The game was really not what I expected . I could do with a little more talking and a lot more puzzles and games. I really didn't like the storyline either but you really can't beat free.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I love this book so much i recommend it to everyone it is terrific. I had to read it for school and i couldnt out it down
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I've always lie  this game and it is awesome on my kindle if I'm bored. Love it! :)<br />I will recommend it to everyone I know!
B003HARV3Y|2.0|Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief is mediocre at best as both a film in general and also a fantasy film.  I have seen many fantasy movies at this point like The Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Narnia films, the Harry Potter films, etc.  Compared to all of those films this does not stack up well.  It is definitely not the worst fantasy movie out there.  It is not as bad as the Twilight Saga or the Golden Compass, but it is not anything special either.<br /><br />First of all I did not find the characters interesting at all.  They are the stereotypical characters that you tend to find in a story like this.  Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman) himself is the typical hero and fish-out-of-water characters.  There is nothing to his character that I have not seen before and done better.  Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) is the typical black comic relief who I did not think was that funny.  The best character in the movie is definitely Annabeth (Alexandra Deddario).  She is the love interest I guess, but she is tough and can take care of herself.  She is the best of the main cast, but even her I did not find all that interesting either.  There are other decent character like Zeus (Sean Bean) Mr. Brunner (Pierce Brosnan), but they are not in the film that much.<br /><br />The story is very simple and not interesting.  Someone stole Zeus's lightning bolt and they half to go find it.  Sometimes simple stories can work if the movie is entertaining, but in this case it wasn't.<br /><br />Another thing that did not work for me was that they take a lot of Greek Mythology and modernize it for comedy which does not work at all, at least for me.  The comedy is not funny at all either.  There were a couple scenes that got a laugh but mostly the humor was dry.  The effects were not that good either.  They were not bad but compared to Harry Potter or Narnia, the effects are lackluster.<br /><br />Overall, I would skip this one.  I heard the books are fairly good.  I f you are interested in this then read the books.  The new movie is coming out and it does not look any better looking at the trailer.
0345479092|5.0|I have given this book now for the fifth time to my kids, stepkids, and nephew. The tips not only make for a better parent, but also a better Grandparent. I look GOOD calming a baby when nobody else can figure it out!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Very motivational book. Adam Brown inspired me to renew my faith in God and also push me to be a better person in life. Never take anything for granted, appreciate the things you have and strive to never quit in reaching your goals.
B009R659L8|5.0|So many twists and turns!  Couldn't figure it out until the very end.  Loved the characters and the way they were intertwined.
0894803123|5.0|Pretty cool recipe book.  In fact I purchased a second for a friend and will probably do so every time someone purchases an ice cream maker!  Makes a great, inexpensive gift!
B00499QUK2|5.0|The actors and writers have done an excellent job in bringing this to the small screen.  If you get tired of watching mystery shows where you can guess what happens 5 minutes in, this show is for you.  The twist and turns make for a very enjoyable journey.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|The DVD doesn't disappoint the Miss Ross fans.  This is Diana in all her glory!  Fabulous DVD great for any collector
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This thing absolutely works 100% as-advertised, unless you have a slightly older HDTV that doesn't listen to HDMI CEC commands (like I do, in which case you only lose the auto-powerup and input auto-switching features).  Then it works 98% as advertised, but that's not Google's fault.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged by some reviews I have seen that talk about &#34;Google&#34; only supporting a small number of apps.  Those reviewers don't understand how this works and why their arguments are irrelevant.  All the power is in the device you use to control the Chromecast, and compatibility is dependent on the app authors (not Google).  Google is providing APIs that should make it pretty easy to add Cast capabilities to apps, to the ball is in the developers' courts to expand the number of compatible apps.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|UNO &amp; FRIENDS is a great app!!!! You can play it when your board and it is very fun to play with friends and family too!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A lovely production - great writing - not enough adjectives to express my enjoyment of this series! - And the fact that you can buy the DVD's and &#34;streaming video&#34; is included at no charge...Shazam!
B00785P2QC|5.0|great virtual game.to make a city were you make environment friendly.something that the world needs to everyday.this should make you think before you build anything.
1423101472|5.0|All of this series is great, so my scoring might be a little bit biased, since I like the author/the series. Ha ha<br />I am glad to have bought it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is SO fun. There is no telling what they are going to throw on you next. It is fun jumping on trains. The jet pack ID AWSOME.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I downloaded this app as the &#34;Free app of the day&#34; last week.  I love music so I decided to give it a try.  I absolutely love it!  There are so many different combinations you can create, making this app endlessly fun.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|hours of great pvp.  worth the download.  if you enjoy moba games this is one of the best for your tablet.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|no hassle, fast delivery, brand new condition. I would recommend this device to any PC gamer that is used to the mouse + keyboard accuracy as oppose to the ridiculous thumb twisting game pad :)
B00C81LYH2|4.0|Unlike most people who buy this Barbie, I actually got this for my six year old niece who loves to play Barbies, so I fully expect her to play with it, not have it sit in a box.  I've not given it to her yet, but I fully expect her to love it in all of it's holiday opulence.<br /><br />I don't know how it compares to other past holiday Barbies, but I love that this is in a shimmery silver, though I'm not crazy about the actual fabric.  We have other dresses made out of this material and it seems to rip apart at the seams relatively easily with repeated use.  She has lovely sparkly earrings that are sure to be a big hit.  My only other small complaint is that one of her arms is permanently bent to rest on her hip, and while it looks great with this dress in the box, it isn't ideal for everyday play and makes it harder to fit other clothes on this doll.  This won't be a concern for everyone who plans to just keep the doll in the box.  Overall I don't think there will be any disappointed collector's or girls who simply want to play Barbie :)
B001FB4W0C|5.0|This has been my favorite season so far, and I was so happy I could get it cheaper here on Amazon than any other retailer!!
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|I only started watching Criminal Minds to fill some time in the evening.  Now I'm HOOKED!  I can't wait for the next season to begin!
B00821OX98|4.0|I think this is a very good show.  I like action and adventure shows.  I like the realism of the show as far as family and love gos.  Know matter what is happening in the world; family, trust, love and working together means people will Servive.
0756407915|1.0|I dumped it after 500 pages. That's hours of my time I will never get back. Really, it is a boring, tedious book in which nothing much really happens. It's also repetitious. The 500 pages I read could have been edited down to 200 and it wouldn't have changed the plot. (What plot?)
B00B769XB8|5.0|However, I can take or leave the 3D stuff, it's interesting, but does not add much to the film.  Movie has some weak areas, and its not concise enough, dry in spots.  I like the Special effects, and that was entertaining.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|We are buying the seasons as we go- don't have HBO.  We are hooked and I was disappointed to see that season 3 do want come out till Feb - valentines day present? I think so
B004I744AS|5.0|I'm a word game person so not only is this a great dictionary, it is also  offers great word challenges.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|A great read full of adventure and action.  More importantly though, it is a tale which looks at the values we place on lives, friends, and families.  James Rollins has written a story which intertwined science, religion, myth, and most importantly hope for hope or belief is what leads us to the path of our future.  Thank you Mr. Rollins for a great read and dream.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Excellent character development.Great story lines.<br />I thought HBO had the monopoly on great drama, but The Shield truly proves otherwise.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I've read all of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels, and I think the last one was excellent.  She wrapped up all the loose ends and the story is an excellent conclusion to the series.  Also, very adult!
B00C3JU7D6|2.0|DOn't get me wrong.  I bought the CD when it came out, this album is fantastic. Every single song (Besides Rat a Tat) is just fantastic!  but this vinyl is the worst new vinyl i have ever purchased!  they are 2 10 inch vinyls (nor regular 12 inch LP's) and the quality is flat out terrible!! it sounds so compressed and the digital version sounds better.<br />I am a huge vinyl fan. but please don't waste your money on this vinyl.  you will be disappointed
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|This was a great movie. It kept me waiting to see what was going to come next. I liked having both the Blu-ray and DVD with digital copy all in one package. It saves on storage space. There were no defects in the discs.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Fun Fun Fun!! and the app works great too! I down loaded this app on my kindle. I spend at least two hours on this app and have never had a problem.
B0051MKMNC|4.0|The movie was alright. It was not as good as I expected it would be.  There were no deficts in the movie disc. I did like having both the versions to watch.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Google chromecast is amazing. I can't believe how much bang I got for my buck. It's great for parties, especially when you can pick and choose from your phone. Overall, it's a no brainier, buy one!
B0063GORYU|4.0|This game is an old windows computer program but you can now have it on the go. When playing using one suit (Spades or Hearts) it is easy to win.  However one you go to two suits or more, the difficulty really ramps up.  would recommend this to anyone who wants to play a different type of solitaire away from home.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is great! Nice story, awesome graphics, and the puzzles are just hard enough. Will be downloading another G5 game!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|ordered the electrical paste same time as the 12v electrical device for my Father-in laws cooler. The paste arrived in same package as the device in two days.worked great !!
B00B2TE7FC|3.0|They are very talented to be sure and the music is good. However, it feels as though they have not settled on a cohesive sound per say as each song sounds like it could come from a different band. Again, the music is good but you should know what you're getting into.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Easy going and fun and not to frustrating! Nice to just relax or take up some time when bored. Also good for kids :)
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I loved everything about this movie. The love story that was told was very creative for a zombie movie. It also showed how one thing could cause a change, and for a good. Very good movie.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|It was a great movie with a great twist.<br /><br />However, I disliked that it didn't really show the damage that psychotropics really do cause in side effects!<br /><br />Otherwise, the acting was AWESOME in all counts and this movie is worth the watch!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very engaging. It reminds me a lot like the puzzles in the original resident evil game. This game keeps your mind thinking to get out. Would be better if it had a time limit to solve puzzles though.
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|It's ok. It does give you some ideas on certain levels.  Other levels they just show you how to play. Of course they get the candies in good order to mix the stripes with the solids. I tried it a couple of times but not too impressed.
B001F9Y2CM|5.0|I have several of their recordings but having all of them in one box is great and recommend it to any buyer
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Excited to find a free version !  Still learning how to play.  Won't let me change color sometimes when I still have cards left in current color being played.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is definitely my new favorite game. It flew past Angry Birds and Plants vs. Zombies. And those games I've beaten. I've only scratched the surface of this game.<br /><br />I like strategy games in general, and Bloons 5 is everything I could ask for out of at Tower Defense game. There are more than twenty different towers, each with their own skills, and each of these towers has different upgrades. You can unlock the upgrades pretty quickly, which makes for plenty of variety early on. But if your worried that the game will be too easy don't be, because the maps come with easy, medium, and hard difficulty, and they definitely are that difficult. And there are 10 maps that I've unlocked so far, with as many as twenty once I get done. There are acheivements and unlockables.<br /><br />There is no better tower defense game that you can buy.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|Visually, this movie is gorgeous. If you like watching things for aesthetic and not so much anything else, then you'd love this movie. I read the book, and in general they get the spirit of the book, but it's extremely different. Many people will not care about that, but it was rough for me. In a lot of ways the plot they condensed into this movie became more and more confusing as the movie went on because the extra information they omitted wasn't there to explain.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|Nothing fancy, just a cover.  It was what I was looking for and it was a good price.  If you are looking for fancy, this is not it.
B00030DEQE|3.0|Item was installed in an older PC that needed a higher speed connection for online backups.  This item installed easy enough and has worked for about 1 year with only occasionally dropping connections.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I use google search a lot on my phone. Hope it works as well on my Kindle. This is my 3rd Kindle.  I don't like some of the features.
B00D0OR5EC|4.0|Susanna Kaysen gives us an inside view of mental health treatment in the 1960's. Her intelligent, yet humorous explanation of mental illness as simply an alternative reality had me nodding my head in agreement at some points, and questioning my own sanity at times.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a great study in the social evolution in the early 1900s.  The charaters are emotionally engaging. You find yourself loving or hating or loving and hating them.  I watch Downton Abbey on flights and have laughed out loud and even shed a few tears in public.  I have also had people sitting next to me and airline attendents comment on how much they love this series too.
B00000JLWW|5.0|I always love a good &#34;chick flick.&#34; Plus, I love the history surrounding the fateful ship, the Titanic. Although it isn't 100% accurate, I still love this movie!
B004SIP8W0|5.0|A classic movie for the whole famliy. I get teary eyed every time I watch this film. Italian with English subtitles.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This was a free download on my kindle fire.  My four year old granddaughter LOVES it.  She would sit there for hours if I would let her.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies! It first introduced me to Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds. The music numbers are addictive; we sing them at work a lot when there aren't any customers around.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|I just love Hugh Jackman, he is a great actor, and to think of all the movies he has done it's the xmen series that start off his famous career as a actor. A must have movie
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book highlights some interesting biases we all probably have and don't even realize. If everyone in the workplace could have open dialog about them both men and women would be better off at work and in the home.
B000HEWEEE|5.0|Great Movie, most powerful love story I've seen in a very long time. to bad that doesn't work in the real time..lol
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I was late in joining the Downton Abbey craze yet was very happy to watch every show without having to wait for the next season. Is Season Four out yet. Love this show. It has been a while since I have watched a show that we talk about at work all the time.<br />kjv1956
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I love this movie, I'm not one for action movies but this one is awesome. great actors great story line, worth buying
B00AALX5SI|5.0|Perry's story is one of daring and of triumph over the odds. She is a megastar of the heart. Her story is our story. Her success is a reminder to people of all ages to embrace and have unending faith in our highest potential. Her creativity and responsibility to her soul self fills the screen with a wonderland of beauty, makes the pain universally felt, and celebrates her triumph as a miracle of the human spirit in it's best form.
0316056898|5.0|Tina Fey is so smart witty and funny and I love her feminist perspectives on being a woman in comedy
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars was my favorite read of the summer. The writing, the plot, and the characters were all pure perfection. Yes, the topic of terminally ill teenagers is depressing, and yes, you will absolutely cry your freaking eyes out, but this is one of those stories that HAS to be read and will stay with you forever. Seriously, everything about this book is raw, real, and hauntingly beautiful. His writing literally takes my breath away! I loved the writing, story, and characters so hard that it's not even funny. I honestly have no words. All I can say that y'all have to read this book. It is beyond a 5 star read in my eyes.
0345529057|5.0|One of the greatest series ever! Definitely worth reading. You'll pick them up and burn through them, completely addicted. Promise!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Long..moved very slow. Could have been condensed with book four. Although I enjoy the detail Of many a great novel, I found myself getting annoyed at the endless description of food and clothing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I usually do not like science fiction, but could not put this book down! Added to that I found the book beautifully written.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Classic game of UNO playing with people is fun! I just wish we could change the rules up like the other hand does!!!
B002JVWQSW|1.0|The first disc doesn't play AT ALL.Just squeaking noises & frozen video.No doubt that's why this set was sold and so cheap.I haven't watched the other discs yet,but the 1st discs damage alone makes this purchase a wash.I'll have to go somewhere else to get the first disc.Waste of money.NOT recommended AT ALL.
B004AQR29C|2.0|a bunch of old action hero movie stars doesn't quite cut it.  The script is weak and the acting ranges from ok to pathetic.  I can't believe this made enough money for them to consider making a second one.  If you like action movies, this one is tolerable, but no more.  If you are not an action movie person, don't waste your time.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|While Christian wrestles with his inner demons, Anastasia must confront the anger and envy of the women who came before her, and make the most important decision of her life.
B006C45MRE|4.0|Not great, but good.  It was entertaining and the special effects were good.  The story line is interesting and a twist on your typical western.
B007EECSFA|4.0|During a summer party at the family farm in the English countryside, sixteen-year-old Laurel Nicolson has escaped to her childhood tree house and is happily dreaming of the future. She spies a stranger coming up the long road to the farm and watches as her mother speaks to him. Before the afternoon is over, Laurel will witness a shocking crime. A crime that challenges everything she knows about her family and especially her mother, Dorothy—her vivacious, loving, nearly perfect mother.<br /><br />Now, fifty years later, Laurel is a successful and well-regarded actress living in London. The family is gathering at Greenacres farm for Dorothy’s ninetieth birthday. Realizing that this may be her last chance, Laurel searches for answers to the questions that still haunt her from that long-ago day, answers that can only be found in Dorothy’s past.<br /><br />Dorothy’s story takes the reader from pre–WWII England through the blitz, to the ’60s and beyond. It is the secret history of three strangers from vastly different worlds—Dorothy, Vivien, and Jimmy—who meet by chance in wartime London and whose lives are forever entwined. The Secret Keeper explores longings and dreams and the unexpected consequences they sometimes bring. It is an unforgettable story of lovers and friends, deception and passion that is told—in Morton’s signature style—against a backdrop of events that changed the world.
B004V98UKS|2.0|Looks easy, but it isn't.  Some levels are easy, but I have come across two levels that have taken me a long time to figure out.  There are a few annoying things.  The games starts up with annoying music.  You can turn it off in the settings, but the setting is only for the session.  Next time you start up the game the annoying music is back.  UPDATE. So I got a new phone, as we all must do eventually.  I downloaded this again, but it is a newer version called Boxit 2 Free.  The game is the same and still challenging and entertaining.  But now they throw ads, both static and video, at you.  This is very annoying, especially the video that you can't skip.  For that reason alone I am downgrading the rating.  Update 4/15  The ads got so annoying I just uninstalled the app.  These were quick occasional ads, they were data eating videos you couldn't skip that popped up between play, not to mention the banners that popped up during play.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|If you have read the first 3, then you will undoubltly enjoy this Crouch novel. Secret service agent Ethan Burke arrives in Wayward Pines, Idaho, with a clear mission: locate and recover two federal agents who went missing in the bucolic town one month earlier. But within minutes of his arrival, Ethan is involved in a violent accident. He comes to in a hospital, with no ID, no cell phone, and no briefcase. The medical staff seems friendly enough, but something feels…off. As the days pass, Ethan’s investigation into the disappearance of his colleagues turns up more questions than answers. Why can’t he get any phone calls through to his wife and son in the outside world? Why doesn’t anyone believe he is who he says he is? And what is the purpose of the electrified fences surrounding the town? Are they meant to keep the residents in? Or something else out? Each step closer to the truth takes Ethan further from the world he thought he knew, from the man he thought he was, until he must face a horrifying fact—he may never get out of Wayward Pines alive. Intense and gripping, Pines is another masterful thriller from the mind of bestselling novelist Blake Crouch.
B004478GNI|4.0|Like many I have been tempted by cheaper Lego like toys.  You buy them and when you use them you can tell the difference.  They are not made quite as well as Lego.  Lego just works better.  So when you can get Lego on sale you jump on it.  I did and I like this set.  It's great for kids as they learn to read and follow instructions as well as work on their manual dexterity.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Well, you will need to read this one to see if your going to be into the series &#34;fifty shades trilogy&#34;.I havent bought the second one yet..its not intended for young readers..but has potentional to be a good trilogy..
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this games was awesome until the update. otherwise it would have gotten 5 stars. now when I try and play it it just sits there and tryst to load. its sat here for like 6 hours. it still hasn't loaded.  I would reccomend this game to everyone of it still worked. please somebody give me some tips
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game has been a family game we've played for as long as I can remember. Now Mr and my family can play when we're not together.
B004G600A4|5.0|Bought for my grandaughter and she loves it. Its fun for the whole family. Lots of humour for everyone. Enjoyable.
B00B31A1CW|5.0|I am going to see Dweezil play this record live next month, so I bought the album to get acquainted with the songs. I am so glad I did because it is amazing! Can't believe I had heard only one of the tracks previously on a You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore cd.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I have read all the books in the Percy Jackson series, and the others in the Heroes of Olympus series. I know it's part of the adventure, but these kids never get a break. I'll continue to read because I want to know what happens next, but I wish they could just have a rest before it gets life-threatening again.
0385349947|5.0|As a working mom who returned from maternity leave at the beginning of the year, this is a great book for managing my life and expectations at home and at work. I've already recommended it many times and bought it as a gift for my best friend who was recently promoted.
B00DZVKQGY|5.0|***I received a copy of this book for an honest review***<br /><br />Roses hits the mark with a raw and blunt use of the modern English language, to tell a story that is dark, sad and tragic, with a hint of coming-of-age, all rolled into one. We follow the life of Amanda, a girl who is just seven years old when we first meet her, whose path was never going to be easy after she caused the death of her twin sister. The author caught the confusion and the guilt that one would shoulder after such an event, in my opinion. It's a sad tale with occasional moments of joy. To be read with a box of tissues handy.
B006S086AM|5.0|It was very funny and made me laugh. I hate having to write a review just to give a product stars.
B00E9PMMPI|4.0|It should be remembered that FANTASTIC VOYAGE was the first significant \\"modern\\" science fiction movie from a major Hollywood studio in the mid-'60s, following the spate of Jules Verne/H.G. Wells period sci-fi that defined the \\"A\\" end of the genre from 1954 (beginning with Disney's 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA) to 1964 (ending with Harryhausen's FIRST MEN IN THE MOON).  FANTASTIC VOYAGE's production values were state-of-the-art for '66, the film boasts a strong ensemble cast, and its premise remains ingenious to this day.  Ultimately, the critical and financial success of FV set the stage for PLANET OF THE APES, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, and countless others that followed.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was fun and challenging. Recommend highly...it only took a few days but I couldn't put it down until it was complete. Can't wait for the next game.
0618871713|1.0|This book is trash and MANY of us citizens and taxpayers of South Carolina are appalled that brand new freshman are REQUIRED to buy and read this book. Comparing it to the required reading of nine other state colleges and universities this summer, the College of Charleston is way out of the mainstream for this state. The other colleges and universities have chosen very classy and edifying books for their required summer reading. I WOULD NOT allow my child to attend the College of Charleston this year or any other year. Proud that my children have attended The Citadel and Columbia College, far better choices. Perhaps cutting state funding for this college will wake their administration up. Raising tuition will allow the families who enjoy this trashy \\"literature\\" and want their 18 year olds to read it to pay the bills.

READ IT READ IT READ IT!!!
B00CO8D3G4|1.0|I found nothing worthwhile in this book.  The saddest thing is that this book was recommended by someone I thought had similar thoughts and values that I did.  He was wild about it!  So, if he was wild about it, I conclude that he and I have nothing in common.  I know that I have nothing in common with James Altucher.  I read over 170 pages assuming it would get better, but I was wrong!  I finally quit reading to write this product review.  I was offended by the many uses of slang and obscene words that added nothing to the topic. The title says it all --- there is nothing about altruistic values in this book.  It is a sad commentary on the moral degradation that is so common now.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I have now downloaded this twice.  Can't get into the game beyond the opening scene.  It goes to give me a tip, says it's loading and stays that way.  I let it go all night last night to see if it ever loaded, it did not.  Too bad, looks like a fun game.
B00CZAYOWI|5.0|what would have been. should have stayed with bob rock for this album. the cult screwed up with ceremony. got to big to fast. still they haven't let up. still rocking strong even though there message has changed.
B00BAXTYF8|5.0|I have the Blu-ray of this film, but also have purchased the original DVD release and the Special Edition DVD releases in the past.  The video quality is an upgrade beyond the HD mastering.  There's less evidence of artifacting, better color saturation, and more fluidity in the action sequences (this is largely due to the 24fps nature of Blu-ray and a television that can exploit that).  The sound quality is equally impressive.<br /><br />Okay, so now to the film.  It's often said that this film \\"killed\\" the old Star Trek film franchise.  The same is said on TV for Enterprise.  Both are lies.  I won't delve into Enterprise here, but something must be said about Nemesis here.<br /><br />Paramount really bungled the release of this film.<br /><br />Much is made about the box office and I think the failure there and the seven year gap between this film and the reboot (Star Trek - 2009) have caused fans to reflexively view it in a negative light; a far more negative light than it deserves.  The marketing on the film was poor, indicating that Paramount gave up on it.  Yet I think the lead reason they gave up was due to its poor location in the release schedule.  While Harry Potter had been in theaters for a month, Paramount put out Nemesis less than a week before The Two Towers was to be released.  The Christmas season is a busy time and Star Trek films often get lost in the shuffle during those busy seasons.<br /><br />So Nemesis became a box office disaster, falling far below First Contact and falling short of the tepid box office of Insurrection as well.  Someone must be blamed and the Paramount execs likely didn't want the finger pointed at them.  That's not to say that Berman hadn't made mistakes - I'm no Berman apologist.<br /><br />Yet there's a lot of silly nitpicking with this movie that other Star Trek films don't receive.  Why haven't we heard about the Remans before?  Hmmm, maybe we don't know everything about an enemy that the Federation barely knows!  Why isWorf on the ship?  It seems he was attending a wedding and hadn't resigned his Starfleet commission (maybe they were all together for a nostalgic last cruise together before Riker took over the Titan?).  Most of the nitpicks can be easily explained.  They are not flaws in the script or plotholes because they are easily explained.  I find it funny that many complain that movies are unintelligent but then complain when a screenwriter, director, or producer believes that a viewer can figure things out for themselves.  Do you want your hand held or not?  You can't have it both ways.<br /><br />Are there contrived points in the plot?  Sure!  Seeing as the script must be fabricated, the whole film is technically contrived.  All films are contrived.  All films also have a lot of \\"convenient\\" moments since the story doesn't just naturally flow out of interaction, but actually is forced by the writer or writers.<br /><br />I guess the complaints of the plot being Picard centric could be somewhat valid, but how often has this truly been an ensemble cast?  First Contact was pretty Picard centric, but he is the Captain, after all.  The Next Generation cast never functioned like The Original Series cast where three characters emerged.  All the series that followed Kirk, Spock, and McCoy gave us a strong captain (or commander initially in DS9) and a good supporting cast below.  So should we be surprised that the Next Gen movies focused mostly on Picard?  Data was really the secondary character and he also received much focus in the films, as he does in Nemesis.  The brilliant aspect of Nemesis is that it uses Data and Picard's stories in parallel, juxtaposing them.<br /><br />True, every detail is not examined.  We hear nothing of Lore, but why do we need to?  He's disassembled and accounted for.  Why confuse a potential audience unfamiliar with every single TNG episode?<br /><br />But a pattern emerges; one of choice and change.  The villain, Shinzon, refuses to believe he canchange who he is.  Picard believes the opposite and a futuristic Arthurian tale is shown on the screen.<br /><br />Even the \\"contrived\\" features of Nemesis are quite good.  The \\"dune buggy\\" scene is often despised.  I love it.  Why?  It shows that people like Picard in the 24th century aren't all snooty all the time.  Humanity still likes to have fun.  It's not all sanitized starships and bland technobabble - a high speed open air romp still has its place.<br /><br />Nemesis does reach into the old \\"your the closest ship\\" problem Star Trek has, but it handles it brilliantly with that dune buggy chase.  Not to give too much away, but it seems the Romulans know the Federation likes to send the closest available ship so they lured the Enterprise close to the Neutral Zone and then called Starfleet and asked for a meeting.  I found that to be a smart workaround.<br /><br />So the film has story.  It has emotional resonance (the main emotional point is really high but I won't delve into it, other than to say it is the most significant sacrifice in Star Trek history).  It allows the viewer to contemplate his or her own nature and choices.  It has some good action sequences (and remember that Star Trek didn't have big budgets prior to the 2009 reboot, so the action scenes were not as extensive as they'd have liked).  In many ways, I find it better than First Contact.  I do think it could be improved by adding back in scenes left of the cutting room floor, but it moves quickly as it is.  It explains everything or lays enough out for the viewer to think it through.<br /><br />We know Picard goes on.  We know Riker gets his own command, yet The Next Generation as we knew it ended at Nemesis.  They may not have gotten to sign their names like the original crew did, but this was a good ending.  It closed a story (kinda) and gave us a hope for the future.  The crew didn't just go into mothballs.  They lived.<br /><br />So open your mind, throw out your preconceptions or past biases.  Look at Nemesis with the freshest eyes you can manage.  You may be surprised to find a fine film that is not perfect, but that is worthy of your attention.
B0001I55SS|4.0|watched this movie in middle school. it was awesome. good under the radar movie. good action. ok plot. good special effects.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I get the point that all the negative reviewers are making, but I still liked this book and will read the next one.  Part of my customer satisfaction here was undoubtedly because I read the negative reviews which pointed out that this third book in the series would not resolve the story line.  But I bought and read it anyway and am prepared to buy and read installments four and five in the series.  Perhaps if I'd been caught unaware, I would also feel duped and cheated.<br /><br />The newest mystery facing Eva and Gideon has me very intrigued.  And I'm enjoying Eva's development as her character matures.  The Brett story line has become irritating, but I was not furious with Eva over her actions.  Hopefully, book four will arrive soon!

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I could not put it down.  I literally stayed up til 3 in the morning for three straight nights.  Enthralling account of what &#34;could have been.&#34;
B00BEIYMAG|4.0|At this point, the catchphrase, \\"based on a true story,\\" has been attached to so many middling horror movies that it has lost whatever sort of potency it might have once held. Yet, in the case of The Conjuring, the tag created a personal sense of excitement and foreboding. I've met the movie's paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren, on a handful of occasions. I grew up in the same part of Connecticut they resided, and would see them at local restaurants and once attended one of their lectures. This isn't to say I particularly believe their claims, but our neck of the woods was known for an inordinate number of alleged hauntings and I always got a kick out of the local color having these kooks around added to our otherwise boring New England town.<br /><br />This is far from the first film to turn to the Warrens for inspiration, who were allegedly more than eager to see their claims thrown up on a big screen. But it is, as far as I know of, the first time Ed and Lorraine have been the protagonists in a film. Played by Vera Famiga and Patrick Wilson, the duo might be a little bland in their cool professional approach to the supernatural, but they're a perfect vehicle for investigating the paranormal, taking a backseat to the macabre case at hand.<br /><br />By my tally, The Conjuring is the ten-thousandth retelling of the Amityville Horror. While not specifically based on the 1979 quasi-classic or the alleged real life account, it lifts liberally from the story and the \\"facts\\" surrounding the event. After introducing the Warrens via the Case of the Obviously Incredibly Haunted Doll, the film cuts to the Perron family settling into their beautiful new home in bucolic middle of nowhere. Right from the start it's obvious there's something up with the house, and the movie takes it's time cranking up the heat from bumps in the night to gleefully over the top demon possession.<br /><br />It's a haunted house storyline you've experienced a million times before, but The Conjuring really excels in the telling. Director James Wan, still best known the original Saw, trades gratuitous gore for long pauses and dark shadows that build unbearable tension. It's the kind of movie where the audience yells at the screen for the characters to get the hell out of the house, helmed by a director who knows how to stretch the tension until you open you're eyes back up before letting something nasty loose from the dark.<br /><br />The Conjuring smartly cribs off golden age horror films of the 1970's. But a film cannot function on awesome sideburns and big collars alone; it's the old school camera mechanics, the flat but functional dialogue, the title card slowly rising from the bottom of the screen that make this throwback so refreshingly entertaining. It's the kind of format I could sit through time and time again with little more than a shuffle of the supernatural elements at play to keep me happy and coming back for more. If this isn't a franchise in the making, I don't know what is.The Conjuring really excels in the telling.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|all 8 dvds come in one case, plus a sleeve. the plastic case is surprisingly good quality! i have been a huge harry potter fan since i was about 5 and this is a great price for such good quality!
B005LAII4E|2.0|I collected G.I. Joe figures, watched the cartoons and was a HUGE fan. The animated movies rocked, the first real-life action they did  a few years ago I was able to get through. This one was horrible, I couldn't get through it, terrible job of using the characters esp. Cobra Commander. Plot sucked, just waste of time.
B004G606K8|5.0|Im rereading this for prolly the third or fourth time. It is an excellent series with wonderful characters I highly recommend it. I would also read the legends series after reading this as that is wonderful too. The other series are generally decent but not as strng as those two.
B008I3R2VG|5.0|arrived on time and in good condition. I would purchase again thru this seller, although it would probably be as a gift for someone...not much call for hard-copy media anymore; everything is in the cloud

B0036EBARO|5.0|since some of the reviewer here have already reviewed track by track. here's my own experience while listening to the whole album,<br /><br />I hear a bit Depeche Mode, Erasure, Kraftwerk, The Motels, Blondie, A-ha, Laura Branigan, Kate Bush and Olivia Newton John,<br /><br />since I'm a fan of the 80's Pop Music so this really works for me.<br /><br />this album really brings me back in time were so many artist try to recapture the spirit of the 80's and failed while Goldfrapp succeed, that's how awesome this band really is........
B00C7L8DM2|4.0|Liked the actor in this role though I liked him more in Olympus Has Fallen ,,,,,,,,liked this movie and do recommend it
B006LSZECO|5.0|A wonderful twist and turn for people who who can get caught up in a story that seems like one thing at the top level, and soemthing else down deeper. While people are unsure of the ending, it's a realistic book about choices, whether or not the reader agrees with what is offered.
B00CHI5F5S|5.0|Reminded me of The Untouchables but this one is more action packed and it really shows how America suffered during that time at the hands of Mafia guys like Micky Cohen ,,,,,,,,do recommend it
B007THA4FI|2.0|Tried three times to read it. The characters are unlikable and this prevented me from being able to continue on. It was a disappointment.
B0006VBFM0|2.0|The ticking of the second hand is so loud it needs to be in another room for me to sleep.  As others have said, the plastic peels off the band, however mine lasted a year before any damage started to occur.  I wear it daily.  It's a little clunky; I had a swatch from the skin line previously, though, so I might be biased.<br /><br />The holes side of the band suffered damage from being put in the same loop everyday, so if you're going to lose or gain weight that might become inconvenient.  Overall unsatisfying for a $60 watch.

B004SEUJN2|5.0|This will be a, Bias review . Now three are now extras yes NADDA !! ,Yes not very charitable .

Now to &#34; The Usual Suspects &#34; and why a gave it a five = The transfer is emasculate , True 1080p/ 24 now fluctuation in the frame rate .

By the end of the novel, Gaiman has re-created in his audience the same mind-bending experience he created for the protagonist. Our reading experience becomes part of the story in effect, because we too have dived into the metaphorical ocean of magic and possibilities.

1608193381|1.0|The book is full of information, and it's written very clearly. That's a plus, because you can use your spare mental capacity to process this information properly while the author is busy making a terrible hash of it.<br /><br />I'll be upfront here and admit I come from very similar leanings as the author. But that's precisely why I'm angry with the book. How can somebody so educated and so concerned about the issues allocate the time to write a book and come up so short?<br /><br />One extremely annoying thing about the book is that the author is so consumed with \\"debunking myths\\" that he totally misses the forest for the trees.<br /><br />Like, he has an entire chapter where he's so consumed with debunking the link between education and income (a common excuse in America for why the poor are in trouble) that he forgets where his average reader is coming from. I, for one, am quite happy that more people are going to college. If they got tricked into doing so thinking it's some sort of ticket to prospertiy, hey, whatever works!<br /><br />Or he has another chapter where he rehashes the questionable argument that the washing machine is a bigger invention than the computer. This is a building block toward later saying we don't live in the post-industrial age and you should not have to go to college, I guess. But the truth is it's way way way too early to judge. As I'm writing this, my wife is at home working from her computer. Yeah, maybe she has the washing machine on. But my shirts are at the cleaners'. Jury's out, basically, and the credibility of all people in my camp goes down with the rest of this book.<br /><br />Or he says capital is not international, it's national. Well, we now all know the truth is ten times more nuanced. GM designs its small cars in South Korea, for example, but if it ever goes to die again, it will die again in America. Capital always DIES at home (or asks for help at home). Yes, the arguments the author makes can also be valid. But for goodness' sake, you are destroying their credibility if you don't present the other side.<br /><br />The second thing I don't like about the book is the author needs to man up.<br /><br />For example, he goes telling us the US is doing things poorly, maintains a third world country within it (all of it true stuff, and I wholeheartedly agree) but then when he goes to pick the opposite, the prime example of how thigs are meant to be done, it turns out he likes, get ready for this... Norway. Or Finland. News flash: Norway is rich for the same reason Kuwait is rich. Not because they run the system you and I like. And let's talk about Finland in a couple years' time when no ten-year-old knows what a Nokia phone is. If you really want to build the case for the prosecution, there is no way round explaining FRANCE. The government there is bigger than 50% of GDP, they do loads of planning, they graduate people from the ENA and the other Grandes Ecoles, they are self-sufficient in power because they went nuclear, it should be your paradise. Man up and tell us why you like France. Or Germany. I don't care. But spare us the Scandies. They all fit in my living room.<br /><br />Or he goes telling us that the industrial jobs are just as important as they used to be. A lie. Yes, we use twice as many things as we used to, but we have the way to make them with less input from labor. It's just how it is. If the author had the courage, he'd admit that there are people who for better or for worse will never be able to become \\"ideas people\\" like engineers or doctors or paper pushers and who are also not suited to the services industry and we can either pay for them from the dole or we can pay for them to go to work. Germany understands this so Germany subsidizes their employers. That's how the author needs to build the argument. Or, alternatively, follow the line of argument which states that you cannot expect to design well if you put distance between design and production. Not give usthe mumbo jumbo about how we are still an industrial society.<br /><br />THE most annoying thing in this book, however, and by a country mile, is that for 90% of the arguments the author uses the same proof: So-and-so country (dunno, the US, the UK, all of Africa) was on some massive path to prosperity right after the Great Depression and the Second World War and in the past 30 years things are no longer so hot. So it must be because we put taxes down on the guys who pay them (i.e. the rich) Well, let me tell you something, my Freshman Year in college I missed 17 crew practices due to mononucleosis, and my progress when I got back was truly enormous, but then I reached some type of plateau. You need to do better.<br /><br />And you can do better, if you go into the nitty-gritty of the arguments. But it takes courage to say you like France because its marcroeconomic numbers currently reflect that the \\"automatic stabilizers\\" are working overtime. It takes courage to say that Apple / Foxconn might lose to Samsung because you could get the principle right and the example wrong. It takes courage to risk losing your reader. And, most importantly, it takes courage to concede points to the other side.<br /><br />So I was very disappointed by this book. It's a laundry list and nothing more. And by lacking honesty and proof for its arguments, it's a failure.the mumbo jumbo about how we are still an industrial society.<br /><br />THE most annoying thing in this book, however, and by a country mile, is that for 90% of the arguments the author uses the same proof: So-and-so country (dunno, the US, the UK, all of Africa) was on some massive path to prosperity right after the Great Depression and the Second World War and in the past 30 years things are no longer so hot.

B00BOXZAG6|1.0|Spoiler Alert:<br />Okay; first of all if you only have a grade school education or perhaps watched a few episodes of The Universe on cable, then you are going to find the entire premise of this movie utterly absurd.<br />Gravity is one of the four fundamental forces of the universe. The more mass an object has; the more it attracts other masses. The very idea that two worlds only several hundred feet apart would not crash into each other is ridicules.<br />Secondly, you, or any other object on one world, would be equally pushed down towards each world. The objects in this movie act more like they have positive or negative magnetic poles.<br />Third; how is it that on one world (the wealthy world), which is about 15 stories away from the other world, has warm sunny weather while the other is cold and rainy? \\"Their\\" Sun would shine equally on each world, and actually where these two worlds are almost touching each other they would never have the Sun at \\"high noon\\" because it would always be blocked by the other world.<br />Also, anyone living below each world's equator would never be able to see the other world from where they are. And why do the people in the \\"poor\\" world keep saying they live down below. Everyone on each world would have to look \\"UP\\" to see the other world, so there wouldn't be any \\"down below\\".<br /><br />But this movie is suppose to be about a romance so strong that a man from the poor world is willing to risk everything, including death, to be with a woman he hasn't seen in 10 years, and only knew an apparently short time when they were both young teens.<br />To be believable, that early relationship would have been paramount to carrying you through the rest of the movie; But instead it has a relatively short screen time.<br /><br />The whole jest of this movie is that these two people, from two different worlds (which have their \\"own\\" specific gravity) will find someway to solve this problem and be together. In that regard, it seemed like you are left to figure out if that ever happened.<br /><br />The special effects were only so-so (these days that bar is set pretty high), and the \\"upside-down\\" everything becomes a bit weary after awhile.<br /><br />I watched one of the \\"extras\\" on the making of this movie and the French writer stated the entire idea came from a dream he had in which he saw these two people at the top of two mountains (inversed on two worlds) reaching out to each other. Might have been a nice painting, but NOT a 60 million dollar movie.<br /><br />FYI: I'm not sure if the Blu-ray DVD would make this movie any better because that disc did not work for me. Amazon, with their great customer service, took it back without question. That is why I try only to buy items sold by Amazon, and not another retailer linked to their site.re left to figure out if that ever happened.<br /><br />The special effects were only so-so (these days that bar is set pretty high), and the \\"upside-down\\" everything becomes a bit weary after awhile.<br /><br />I watched one of the \\"extras\\" on the making of this movie and the French writer stated the entire idea came from a dream he had in which he saw these two people at the top of two mountains (inversed on two worlds) reaching out to each other.

B00DRPVE3M|2.0|Its a fun game, however, you can't play very long without getting more coins, once you run out you've gotta wait or buy more. I know its free but the constant asking to pay is bothersome. Do I like the app, yes I do.<br /><br />I am re-reviewing this App, it's maddening, you need money if your really going to play, or wait like I do till you get to scratch a ticket to get enough for another game, get more for $1.99!  Then when you do play there are 3 others who may or may not be paying attention, there is a timer bar and when that runs out there are still seconds to wait!  So the game plays for them on that turn, you may havwe to draw 4 cards.  If the player is not paying attention then that player should have to draw a certain amount of cards not have the game play for them.  Part of the game is paying attention to what other players are throwing down, it often defeats the purpose of a good round of the game.<br />Yes it's a good game but I don't like this aspect of it.  You need money, it only rewards you one token to play when you level up, really? I would be willing ot buy some tokens but not the way the game is set up now, people not paying attention will just waste my money.

You have to discover, get the flow, and just follow along. You will be rewarded on each track. It may be years before you hear anything as good as \\"Step\\", \\"Finger Back\\", \\"Hannah Hunt\\", or \\"Ya Hey\\". Getting to hear albums like this is one of the reasons to stay alive.

0345803450|2.0|I didn't love it.  I thought it was, of course, beautifully written, but Serena, the main character, had no \\"heft\\" and little substance.  Serena seemed to just float around with no moral imperative and little to recommend her as someone you'd like to know.  The most interesting characters were her friend Shirley and co-worker Max.  The technique of stories within stories was clever, but tended to be detrimental the storyline (although I do understand that it was the author's way of having Serena become attracted to Tom before she met him). I actually found it hard to continue reading at times.  The final letter from Tom was probably the most interesting reading of the book.<br /><br />Obviously, others have had a completely different reading experience than I, but that only underscores that all of us view things from our own, very unique, perspective.

0142421715|2.0|**minor spoilers**<br /><br />It's disappointing to say, but I really didn't like this book.  It was a major let down from the first book, and I'm kind of amused because the most tension filled thing that happens in the first book is the main character looks at a room of dish washers and separates the good workers from the bad workers, and no, that's not a lie or an exaggeration.  That's the \\"end fight\\" of the book.  She sorts workers.  And keep that in mind when I say that in comparison, the second book was boring.<br /><br />Now, without context, you don't know that that sorting thing was actually a huge deal, but it still shouldn't make a book filled with death and gun fights and secret societies and rafting and uprisings and so, so much poison seem dull by comparison.  But it did.<br /><br />As many interesting things went on in the second book, I felt that it really dragged, and I honestly couldn't wait for it to be over.  And I think I know why.  It was the people.<br /><br />In the first book, we spend a lot of time in what amounts to suburbia doing things like going to the movies and hiking and pondering prepackaged meals, but the characters and their interactions are so well crafted that it makes even the smallest thing, even the smallest incident seem earth shattering in its intensity.<br /><br />The second book is far more action oriented, but the characters are flat.  Cassia, who grows and changes so much in the first book becomes a static shell of her former self in the second.  Ky is a little better in that we get more insight into his character and see that he's really far more flawed than he first appeared, but they're the only two that carry over from the first book, and everyone else we meet in the mean time either dies or wanders off by the end with the exception of one character who I spent the vast majority of the book smiting.  So...yeah.<br /><br />The author's airy, poetic prose is far more suited to romance, emotional engagements in general,and character interactions. We don't get the emotional depth in Crossed that we got in Matched, and that was where this book failed the most.<br /><br />The book is called \\"Crossed,\\" and it was a fitting name in that I feel like we were literally just spending the whole time going to the plot--crossing this giant, endless canyon on the way to the plot...and never getting there.  I guess it's a quest story, and they do eventually find the goal of their quest, but you don't really care.  The goal you actually care about is reached about 2/3 of the way through the book, and ends up being crapily downplayed because of Cassia's state of mind...which of course gets resolved by her literally saying \\"I'm fine now\\" and it never getting brought up again.  So then we spend the rest of the book going after this new quest that you don't care about because by this point you just want to be done with the canyon they've spent 75% of their time in, and then they get there, and....nothing.<br /><br />And I just realized that the way the book ended basically reset us to where the first book ended.  In fact, you could make minor changes to the end of the first book and have it be where the third book picks up and you'd never know.  Fantastic, book.  You have rendered yourself pointless.<br /><br />Son, I am disappoint.

B0090SI582|4.0|Is 2013's The Wolverine the Wolverine film fans had hoped for, but didn't get in 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine? The answer to that question is a resounding yes. With the success of X-Men: First Class and Fox's desire to create their own comic book film universe like Marvel and Disney are doing Fox smartly made smarter choices with The Wolverine. Fox wisely decided to chose a better director in the flawed, but solid director James Mangold as well smartly basing the films storyline off of the acclaimed writers Frank Miller and Chris Claremont's Wolverine mini-series, and what we get is a flawed and methodically paced film that is fun, exciting, and the second best comic book film of the year.<br /><br />The Wolverine is based off of Chris Claremont and Frank Miller's four issue limited Wolverine series, and one of Wolverine's better storyline revolving around Mariko Yashida (Tao Okamoto) who perhaps Logan's greatest love of his life. Being the fan of the character and storyline this is the storyline I had wanted for a Wolverine besides Logan's origins, and the writers delivered. The film opens up sometime after the ending of X-Men: The Last Stand. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) has been killed by Logan's own hands, and now Logan (Hugh Jackman) lives as a hermit in the mountains content to live a solitary life with his friendly grizzly bear neighbor, and his dreams of Jean. Logan should have known he isn't destined to live of hermit, and his found by Yukio (Rila Fukushima) in a small mountain Canadian town, where she tells him Ichirō Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi) the man he saved back in World War II from a nuclear blast is now dying and wishes to see Logan. In Japan, Yashida offers Logan want he has come to secretly desire in a way to die. There he meets Mariko, Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova), Shingen Yashida (Hiroyuki Sanada) and others as Logan is betrayed and reluctantly gets involved in a family feud.<br /><br />While I did enjoy the storyline of The Wolverine I thinkI need to talk about my problems with the plot. First is the character Kenuichio Harada who is perhaps my biggest issue with the plot. Anyone who has read the comics knows that Harada is the Silver Samurai as well as a mutant, and because of the choice by Fox, Mangold, and the writers not make Harada the Silver Samurai it just makes the character seem out of place in the film, and that Harada didn't really belong in the film at all. All my other issues with The Wolverine's plot are small ones like the lack of screen time for Viper. Instead of focusing on the now pointless Harada Mangold should had focused more on Viper. The other flaw was the dream sequences between Logan and Jean Grey. While I understand why they were added I just thought there were too many of them, and the only one that truly stood out was the final scene between Logan and Jean, which I thought was exceptional. Still even with the flaws in the plot the good outweighed the bad. I loved the chemistry between Logan and Yukio. Yukio is Logan's comrade and friend in the comics, and I feel the writers did do the character justice with her sense of humor and martial arts skills, but more importantly I loved the chemistry between Logan and Mariko. Mariko was well written, and very similar to the comics as are her feeling for Logan. Logan is a haunted man by both the things he has done and the people he has lost, so I loved how the writers showed Logan's haunted side. I'm sure it is not easy being a man who will basically live forever never aging or dying while all the people he loves and cares about are killed or whither and die, and the writers along with Mangold and Jackman do a wonderful job displaying that for the audience to see.<br /><br />Not all fans were happy with the choice of Hugh Jackman back in the first X-Men film. Fans didn't like the appearance of Jackman. He didn't have the same build and was too tall the critics cried, but I didn't a problem with the changes made to Logan's appearanceas long as it was done well, and over five films plus a cameo appearance I think Jackman has proved his critics wrong. Jackman has done a splendid job embodying the character of Logan whether it being his ruthless side or emotional side to the characters mannerisms and style of speech, Jackman has done an excellent job portraying the character as he does here in The Wolverine. Besides Jackman doing another great job as Logan the Japanese cast did a splendid job in their roles as well. Hiroyuki Sanada who also gave wonderful performances in Sunshine and The Last Samurai gives another good performance as Shingen Yashida the son of Ichirō Yashida, and father to Mariko who lets his ambition and desire for power get the better of him. Both Yukio and Mariko are portrayed by young and basically first time actresses, and you wouldn't know it unless you looked it up. Rila Fukushima personality and appearance fit the role of Yukio perfectly, while the beautiful Japanese model turned actress Tao Okamoto did a truly exceptional job with her performance with Mariko. Okamoto perfectly embodied the beautiful and strong willed Mariko as well as her love for Logan. The chemistry between Okamoto and Jackman was excellent throughout the film and especially at the love hotel, which was sweet and funny, and their time together at the home near Nagasaki, Japan, which was heartfelt and emotional. I hope to see both actresses more in the future. Just like Fukushima and Okamoto, Svetlana Khodchenkova is a relative unknown, and besides not having enough screen time Khodchenkova did a good job portraying the villain Viper.<br /><br />James Mangold is a quality director and writers has he has shown in the likes of 3:10 to Yuma, Walk the Line and Cop Land and continues to do a good job directing here in The Wolverine except for the action sequences. Maybe it is the editing of the film to get a better runtime and a pg-13 rating or maybe it is because Mangold didn't know how to direct a comic book film styled action sequence, but with the exception of an outstanding action sequence on a bullet train none of the action sequences truly stand out. It's not that they are bad, because they weren't bad. The action sequences were entertaining; it's just that the majority of the action sequences just weren't riveting or memorable.<br /><br />Fox has definitely gotten what it wanted here with The Wolverine. The film is flawed, but has good character writing and dramatic scenes as well as good direction by Mangold and decent action, and more importantly for Fox, The Wolverine expands Fox's X-Men universe has well as teasing us with the upcoming X-Men: Days of Futures Past. Yes there is a mid-credit scene and it was great. The scene between the three characters is a good lead into next year's X-Men film. The Wolverine is the film fan boys have wanted that will both satisfy fans of the comic and character as well as the ordinary viewer. One will love seeing one of Wolverine's best story lines come to life while the other will just enjoy the fun and entertaining film.

B008JFUR10|4.0|I have heard people compare Guillermo del Toro's Pacific Rim to the likes of Godzilla, The Power Rangers, Transformers and Voltron, but I liken Pacific Rim to a combination Godzilla, Transformers and Top Gun, but with del Toro's own unique storyline and vision. Yes there are elements from the 1986 film Top Gun in Pacific Rim, but I'll get to back to that in a little bit. In a summer filled with endless sequels and comic book films Guillermo del Toro brilliantly brought to life his science fiction monster epic that is both a breath of fresh air and highly entertaining summer blockbuster.<br /><br />In the not so distant future aliens called the Kaiju have invaded Earth, but instead of traveling millions of light years to reach earth the Kaiju have invaded Earth from deep below the Pacific Ocean through a dimensional portal. These Kaiju are hundreds of feet tall devastating everything in their path. With the cost of taking down one single giant monster so high both militarily and humanitarianly the governments of Earth pool their resources together to create giant robots called Jaegers to fight the Kaiju. These giant robots require two pilots who must meld minds, and act as one to pilot the Jaegers. At first the Earth forces are highly successful in eliminating the Kaiju who incidentally only come through the dimensional rift one at a time, but that soon changes when Jaeger pilots Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and his brother Yancy Becket (Diego Klattenhoff) encounter a new kind of Kaiju off the coast of Alaska that is stronger, faster and has adapted to the Jaegers fighting abilities, and the Kaiju soon turn the tide on the Earth forces and the Jaegers.<br /><br />Five years after the events of the coast of Alaska the Jaegers are losing on all fronts, which makes the Earth governments to make a desperately ill-advised decision of making huge sea walls. Why they actually thought that some walls would stop giant aliens from another dimension I do not know, but isn'tsurprising these are politicians after all, and these so called leaders of Earth make another unwise move by shutting down the Jaeger program sending their leader Marshal Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) to a base in Hong Kong where he and the last of the Jaegers from across the world make a last ditch effort to close down the portal between our world and the aliens world. Here in Hong Kong is the last hope to save humanity. Will they succeed or will it be the world as we know it come to an end? Well you'll just have to see the film to find out.<br /><br />Travis Beacham and del Toro's script has many interesting elements to it from where the Kaiju come from, what they really are and what their goals are to the neural interfaces between the Jaeger pilots, which I thought was cool. The two Jaeger pilots minds are linked giving each pilot access to the others mind and memories, and the stronger the bond between the pilots the better team they are. I found this subject interesting, and could definitely see something like what is in the film happening in the not so distant future. Now with that said there are problems with the script. It is very predictable as you can basically know who is going to die and live, and basically how the film will end. For a few minutes in Pacific Rim I felt like I was watching Top Gun all over again. I am not sure if del Toro or Beacham have seen the film or not, but anyone who has seen Top Gun will know what I am talking about. For example all the Jaeger pilots are basically character from Top Gun. Raleigh is the lose canon \\"Maverick\\" while is brother Yancy is \\"Goose\\". Jaeger pilot Chuck Hansen is the \\"Iceman\\" while is father is \\"Hollywood\\", and Pentecost would be a combination of \\"Viper\\" and \\"Jester\\". The rest of the Jaeger pilots from Hong Kong and Russia would easily fill out the rest of the characters from Top Gun. There is even a battle scene in the film that easily resembles the climax in Top Gun where Iceman and Hollywood along withtwo other F-14's are ambushed and outnumbered by a squadron of MIG's, and it is up to Maverick to save them all, and to top it off the scene almost ends the exact same way.<br /><br />Still even with the similarities I enjoyed the storyline and especially the characters. I really liked the character Raleigh Becket. Sure the character storyline is nothing original, but I thought Charlie Hunnam gave a good performance as Becket. Idris Elba who was great in Prometheus is stuck in a predictable character who gives the usual general or commander's speeches when faced with an insurmountable obstacle, yet he still manages to breathe some life into his character. Even though he was playing a similar character personality wise to Charlie Kelly who he plays on the television show It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Charlie Day is still hilarious in Pacific Rim as Dr. Newton Geizler a scientist and Kaiju groupie who plays a pivotal role in the film. Hunnam and Elba might be the \\"stars\\" of Pacific Rim, but the real star of the film is Rinko Kikuchi. The Japanese actress plays Mako Mori the shy adopted daughter of Pentecost who desires for revenge on the Kaiju for killing her parents. The attractive Kikuchi brings such life to the character without much dialog whether it is from her facial expressions like a simple smile or from the look in her eyes Kikuchi can display so much with so little. I really never thought I would say this because I love Ron Perlman, but he was not need in Pacific Rim or at least with the character and storyline del Toro gave him. Ron Perlman plays the black market dealer Hannibal Chau deals primarily with Kaiju goods. The talented actor was wasted with the role he was given, and Chau was useless to the plot just as was the whole Hong Kong plot of searching for a Kaiju brain,, so they can leak to the Kaiju memories. I was hoping Perlman would have given a better character and role to play in Pacific Rim.<br /><br />The Transformers films and Bay successfully made it possible to create believable giant robots in films, and whether you like Bay and is Transformers films or not I doubt del Toro would have been allowed to make Pacific Rim if the Transformers films had not been hugely successful. Instead Del Toro surpasses what the special effects artists did in the Transformers films and beautifully brings his world to life. The Jaegers are masterfully rendered on screen with each machine unique and detailed with their own personality. The same is said for the Kaiju. The effects are done wonderfully giving life to these giant alien creatures, which greatly benefit the action scenes that are remarkable.<br /><br />I really wanted Pacific RIm to be a great science fiction epic, but what I got was a refreshing and highly entertaining film. Pacific Rim will not go down as Guillermo del Toro's best written or directed film, but del Toro does masterfully bring his vision that is Pacific Rim to life. While the some elements of the script and details of the characters are predictable they are both well-crafted and entertaining that you won't mind those flaws, and will be to distracted by the beautiful effects and outstanding action sequences. Anyone looking for a cool science fiction action film or just want to escape the endless sequels and superhero films than I highly recommend they go see Pacific Rim. I highly doubt you will be disappointed with Pacific Rim.

B00CW7KK9K|3.0|Purchased this unit for my wife to replace a body media tracker. She has issues with the body media being in contact with her skin for extended periods.<br /><br />I have used the unit for about two weeks now to evaluate it and be better able to help my wife use it. I also use a bodymedia armband.<br /><br />The setup was a breeze. Connected to my iPhone 5 very quickly.  An update for the unit loaded right after it connected. The update installed with no issue.<br /><br />The pulse integrates very well with the whitings health mate website. The data updates reflect quickly and the display is very user friendly.<br /><br />Actually using the pulse is where the short falls lie. The heart rate monitor is very hit and miss. Out of five tries I might get a near accurate pulse once. I have gotten resting heart rate from 44 to 120 within a five minute period with no change in activity. My actual was about 58 and the pulse only came close once at 60. Frequently the unit is not able to get a pulse and just displays an X on the screen.<br /><br />Tracking steps seems pretty accurate. It compares with my BodyMedia armband within 5% to 10% everyday. I am not sure how it converts steps to distance, but that is WAY off. During a recent six mile run the pulse calculated it at 9.5 miles. Steps were pretty close to the same as my bodymedia armband (which does not attempt to convert the data to distance). I use \\"RunKeeper\\" on my iPhone (Outstanding program by the way) so I am very sure the distance the pulse is recording is way out to lunch.<br /><br />It is very light and very easy to forget you are wearing it. I have had to pull it out of the cloths hamper a couple of times. Fortunately, it has not made it into the washing machine yet.<br /><br />Bottom line, I really like the size and concept of the Pulse and the integration of the data into the Withings HealthMate website. The Pulse just needs a little more work to bring it up to the same standards as the scale and the blood pressure monitor (love both of them).

B000Q66JXA|4.0|The 1981 film Excalibur is a gorgeous film that nearly perfectly blends action, philosophy, drama, fantasy and acting making Excalibur one of the best Author film adaptations to date. With it being the 21st century everyone should have at least heard the names King Author, Excalibur, Lancelot, Merlin and Camelot, and have so kind of knowledge of the Legend of King Author. Author is said to have been an English-Roman in around the 6th century, and who was most likely a descendent of the collapsing Roman Empire soldiers who stayed behind in England. According to legend Author rose quickly to prominence with his leadership ability and military tactics to surmount impossible odds to unite England, defeating the invading Saxons, and creating an empire that encompassed England, Norway, Ireland, Gual and Iceland. The compelling story quickly became popular as it spread across Europe, and certain authors added to the legend of Author by adding the myth of the Sword in the Stone, Lancelot and Merlin along with the fantasy elements. It is no wonder that the inspirational and fantastical story has inspired film and television adaptations like Quest for Camelot, Merlin, First Knight, The Last Legion to name a few, but few are on the level of John Boorman's Excalibur.<br /><br />Boorman's Excalibur is based on Thomas Malory's novel Le Morte d'Arthur, which is a compilation of stories about the life and times of King Author. Barrowman blends elements from each of the short stories into a two hour and twenty minute film that both hurts and helps his film. The story is quickly paced when it comes to events glossing over some character development like the crucial romance between Lancelot (Nicholas Clay) and Guinevere (Cherie Lunghi). The characters do not have a lot of screen time together and if not for the characters facial expressions and emotions you would not believe the two characters had any feelings what so ever for each other. With trying to push all the factual, fictional, mythical and fanciful elements of the legend of King Author being pushed into one film make for a compelling yet lackluster story. Thankfully for Barrowman he is aided by his cast which includes the who's who of Irish and English actors in Gabriel Byrne, Helen Mirren, Liam Neeson and the one and only Patrick Stewart (Professor Charles Xavier and Captain Jean-Luc Picard). These award winning actors along with the rest of the cast turn Excalibur from your run of the mill King Author/Medieval historical film into a compelling epic. The actors deliver their lines eloquently, and with passion breathing life into Excalibur.<br /><br />For a film that is twenty two years old, the action and effects hold up pretty well. Yes with the knights in all their armor make it easy for characters to get lost in the shuffle the action scenes, but the action makes up for it. The battles are well done and violent with characters having their arms cut off, eyes being pecked out by ravens and being decapitated and the effects especially hold up well considering the long period since the film was released. The wonderfully paced score was composed by Trevor Jones who wisely went to classical Carl Orff, and his masterpiece Carmina Burana, smartly used Orff's pieces for many of the battles and climatic sequences. Ireland is a gorgeous country, and is a beautiful place to film a film about King Author, which Excalibur was. The cinematography was simply gorgeous capturing all the different natural scenery of Ireland. Even with the slight flaws in the script John Boorman masterfully directs Excalibur getting the best out of his actors, and the film crew. Boorman could have worked on his editing of the film and the battles, but those are only minor flaws in what as I said was a masterful job of directing.<br /><br />Excalibur succeeds where many films like King Author, First Knight and the Last Legion failed with their adaptations of the Author Legend in creating a beautifully written yet flawed story with, excellent acting and charismatic actors along with gorgeously filmed cinematography, wonderfully choreographed battles, well-crafted directing and an epic score that makes Excalibur the best film based on the legend of Author. If there is one absolute must see film based on the stories of Author than Excalibur is it. Excalibur captures the feeling and essence of the legend nearly perfectly that I highly recommend Excalibur for anyone who is a fan of the Author stories or is just simply interested in a compelling medieval, historical and fanciful film.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is well-written and a very special story. I highly recommend it. :) I don't know what else to say, there's a summary on the page about a boy with a craniofacial abnormality who suddenly goes to school in fifth grade. It's really sweet, and even though I am older I enjoyed it. Acceptance--and kindness, highlighted and shown through the eyes of the boy, his family and his friends.
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|Is there a lot of luck involved, of course.  But, a clearly planned strategy increases your chances of beating the game.  I think some people have trouble with a game you cannot beat 100% of the time.<br /><br />The thing I love about this game is the countless ways to win.  I always randomize my investigators to challenge myself on finding the best approach to victory.
B0023SDPS6|3.0|I wish I could say  how delightful a read this was but it simply wasn't  for me. The only worthwhile section of this book was the final 10 percent of it. I almost didn't even get there because for me it bogged down so much in so many places. I was intending to read the entire series but not anymore. Let me be very clear about the difference in quality between the TV series Longmire and the books. Longmire is terrific, the books not so much in my humble opinion.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed this puzzle game very much. I felt it challenging enough that I felt a great sense of accomplishment when I completed a level, and I never once had to throw it down in frustration! I'm really looking forward to the next levels.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was a page turner and had a great storyline going.  However, in my opinion, the conclusion was somewhat disappointing.  I'm still mulling over how disappointing the conclusion made me feel.
B00BOXZAG6|1.0|Two different worlds exist right next to each other where all matter is pulled by the gravity of the world that it comes from, and not the other, an object's weight can be offset by matter from the opposite world (inverse matter), and after some time in contact, matter in contact with inverse matter burns. With such an interesting and unique dystopian sci-fi world you would think that Upside Down would be a compelling and entertaining film, but writer and director Juan Diego Solanas found a way to turn what could have been a good sci-fi film in Upside Down into a lifeless bore.<br /><br />Upside Down follows Adam (Jim Sturgess) who lives in the poverty stricken Down world. The Up world is the prosperous of the two worlds full of wealthy citizens and lords over the Down world controlling and using the Down world for its own benefit. Cross contact between the peoples of the world is outlawed and forbidden unless it is regulated by the Up world government. At a young age Adam sneaks into a restricted area and encounters Eden (Kirsten Dunst) who is from the Up world. The two quickly fall in love and spend many hours and days together until the very young couple is caught and separated never to be seen together again. Ten years later Adam is researcher scientist working on so sort of anti-gravity product that could change both worlds, but fate has other things in store for Adam as he sees Eden on television who now works for TransWorld an Up world corporation who controls much of the Up world. This new element sets Adam on a race to see his lost love, and sadly ruins what could have been a quality sci-fi film.<br /><br />With an interesting premise as two worlds right next to each other with two different gravity and types of world you would assume writer and director Juan Diego Solanas world focus on exploring the worlds, how they came to be, their histories and peoples creating a different film from what we are given, but instead Solanas decided to focus on the romancebetween Adam and Eden. The romance might have been more compelling if the characters, and their roles better performed by the actors playing them. The audience is supposed to root for Adam and his quest to reunite with Eden, but Adam is an uncharismatic bore which I blame both on the writing of Solanas and the acting of Jim Sturgess (Across the Universe, Cloud Atlas). Whatever Sturgess had in Across the Universe and Cloud Atlas he has lost here in his performance as Adam. Sturgess just lacks the charismatic charm and acting prowess to carry a film like Upside Down on his own. There is also Sturgess/Adam's lack of chemistry with Eden/ Kirsten Dunst which was just horrid to say the least. Kirsten Dunst (Original Spiderman trilogy, Interview with the Vampire and Wimbledon) has an empty shell of a character to work with in Eden. Solanas did not write Eden with a fully fleshed out backstory and the character pays for it. Plus Adam's and Eden's romance just is not believable with the characters and actors lack of chemistry. Dunst and Strugess had no chemistry what so ever which really hurt the film. Maybe if the film had a compelling and heart wrenching romance the film could have at least have been a decent romance film, but Upside Down completely fails at that. Usually if the stars of a film do not have what it takes to carry a film than the director and stars can count on the supporting cast to support them, but the supporting cast in Upside Down is nonexistent.<br /><br />For a modestly budgeted film the effects are pretty good as they do an effective job of showcasing the world Juan Diego Solanas has created highlighting who the two worlds and their gravities operate, and at certain points in the film the effects are really impressive. It is too bad that Solanas did not write an interesting story to go along with his unique world that he had created. Speaking of director Juan Diego Solanas, I believe the Argentina was out of his depth with Upside Down. The directoris unknown to me, but I believe that if he had gotten help with the script and directing to bring his vision to life than Upside Down could have been a higher level of a film.<br /><br />When it comes down to it with Upside Down we are left with what could have been. If the film had a stronger narrative and better written characters that explored the unique sci-fi world and vision of Solanas than I believe Upside Down could have been a really remarkable sci-fi film, but instead what we have gotten is a terrible romance film with sci-fi elements in the back ground along with some good effects, bad acting, and even worse directing turn Upside Down into a unremarkable mess that audiences should just plan skip.

B00E193TM2|4.0|One of the better things that ever happened to members of wasp and motograter were their parting ways with their respective bands and forming the collective known as 5fdp. I both love and dislike their new album but I have much respect for the many years of talent that these guys bring to mat! Was worth the purchase price but I'm hearing more and more of the progressive to commercial undertone with each album recorded, either way they rock hard, they still break out crunchy riffs and Ivan can belt it out and sing his arse off. Thumbs up from a rocker who loves it all!
B005FMZX9Q|2.0|While this is a great watch as far as function goes, its way too heavy to wear comfortably and the dials are positioned for a left-hander.

B008HK3XOU|4.0|Of protecting my Kindle Fire HD. Another reviewer considered it flawed because when closed the HDMI and USB ports are not accessible. If the Kindle is flipped 180 degrees (what could be called upside down), the ports are accessible, and upside down or not, the image is always right side up, so it doesn't matter for most applications. The cover has a pleasantly textured rubber-like finish and it does perform well as an easel, although not for the vertical position. The frame clamps securely onto the corners of the Kindle, but is easy to snap in and out. I'm a little concerned that the elastic band that holds the covers closed may wear out before the rest of the case.
B0011TMOIK|1.0|I tried to download this, but because I am staying in the Philippines right now it would not let me download outside the US

B0032CVAQQ|2.0|i would use this as a reference book rather than a book to read in its entirety.<br />the premise is simple but it was regurgitated to death.
B00DFRVAC2|4.0|The score is an addictive blend of retro and modern elements, with plenty of instrumental and thematic depth to help it stand out from the other MV/RC Zimmer-type scores that dominate so many summer action films. The album flow is very balanced. Good luck trying not to jam out repeatedly with that opening track.
B007FH9GA6|3.0|Lot's of changes and omissions from the book. The original Swedish version of the movie follows the original story much closer.

1451695195|4.0|A beautiful and fascinating book. The author makes the very important point that we are all loved, we are never alone, and there is far better waiting for us. However, he does not mention HOW we get to Heaven, which is by accepting Jesus as our savior and into our hearts.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Great music and it was sold on amazon for less than it was on itunes and I'm very happy with the CD
B000W91RUG|5.0|What more can I say?! It's a great TV show so of course the purchase was good lol got it as a christmas gift and it came on time for the holiday
0307276902|3.0|First off, just let me start out by saying that I was royaly pissed to find out the whole thing was a lie. I didn't hear about this until I was half way through my read. I continued on with it anyway. It wasn't an easy read. I didn't especially care for the way he writes. He doesn't put quotation marks around the words when someone speaks, so it was difficult to tell if someone was speaking or thinking. The story itself was interesting. I mean, how can a drug addict in rehab not be interesting? He did well on touching on what it felt like to go through withdrawal and the internal struggles he dealt with every day, but most of it just seemed to be him wallowing in self pity. I found the other characters in the book were far more interesting than he was. It wasn't one of those books that you are eager to finish reading. I set this book down several times and would return to it after a couple days, only because when I start something, I feel obligated to see it through. I wouldn't read it again that's for sure.<br /><br />So in the end, not great, not terrible. Open at your own risk.
B00BEIYMAG|4.0|This movie is about the Perron family, which includes a mother, father and five daughters, who move into their new home in Harrisville, Rhode Island and start to have strange encounters with ghosts.<br /><br />Upon research, they discovered that 8 generations of a family had inhabited their farmhouse and more than 2 dozen family members had died there - some of the deaths were a result of suicide.<br />Unable to ignore the ghosts who start having direct contact with the family members, Mrs. Perron traces down paranormal researchers, Ed and Lorraine Warren, to try make sense of their bizarre living conditions.<br /><br />The Conjuring is a pretty typical ghost/exorcist story. One thing that stands out about the Conjuring is that its based on real life events. While watching the movie, there were many parts that were really scary. I heard many gasps and screams in the movie theatre audience It's worth it to watch The Conjuring atleast once!<br /><br />4/5
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Recommend it definitely.<br />The first day we downloaded she began to play it and every other word I heard was &#34;i really like this game or it's so much fun.&#34;<br />Great way of passing time.<br />If you like Subway Surfers, you're bound to love this.<br />Everyone loves a minion :)

The people were real, the interactions were great as was the entire story line.  I have had this book for a while (along with about 20 others I haven't read yet), so I don't remember what caused me to buy it.........but I am very happy I did!
B00ABTYGOQ|1.0|My own stupidity is to blame here. I knew I was ordering an Italian import, but for some reason I thought that Blu-ray discs were, like CDs, universal. But no. When I tried to watch the disc, I received a message that the area code of my player (Oppo) would not allow me to do so. I wish that more emphasis had been placed on this detail. I would have saved some money.

B0002ZDVEU|4.0|The Bourne Supremacy has a very vulgar scene where Jason Bourne angles his jeep in such a way; that his<br />love interest gets shot; this is because they have been found in India.<br /><br />Jason Bourne is a good man and he knows what Marie is like but he could have just dumped her into the hands<br />of some torturer by leaving her, instead he took the guilt of getting rid of her in a disengenous way at<br />first opportunity.<br /><br />And this is the resonance of the Bourne Supremacy.<br />For the rest of the film you just sit through the details to get to the next film , the 'Bourne Ultimatum.'<br /><br />For the completist, I will tell you what happens next:<br /><br />Bourne discovers some more of his memories and excavates his past, eludes the C.I.A., not to mention several<br />other agencies whom I will not name because the film does not name them.<br /><br />The film ends with a wounded Jason Bourne apologizing to the daughter of two people he assassinated during his<br />training.<br /><br />*

B00CISC2DA|5.0|After nearly 8 years between this album and their previous album, Campfire Headphase Boards of Canada is back! As a BOC fan who had been jonesing for new material from the brothers, this was a surprise, and a pleasant one. It is a solid piece of work which compares well with their best work. I give it 4 1/2 to 5 stars.The standouts are Jacquard Causeway, Palace Posy and Nothing is Real.<br />If you are a BOC fan, BUY THIS RIGHT NOW! You won't be sorry. If you are new to Boards of Canada, start with Geogaddi and then collect the other albums; don't bother with the EP's unless you really get hooked-quite a few of the EP tracks got put onto albums also.
B008ZDC7M8|5.0|There is nothing else like this: a 15+ hour documentary on the history of film arts, patiently unfolding the intricacies of the evolution of film--the beginnings, visual grammar, the industry, major figures and movements, the changes in technology--all from a world wide perspective. Even those who teach film--and I am one--wlll have much to learn from this grand work.

B00DCRE7M0|4.0|James LaBrie returns with his third solo album and it is yet another excellent melodic metal album that cements his position as a quality solo artist with style. The music on Impermanent Resonance is a mixture of hard hitting metal and melodic ballads featuring lots of keyboard textures and excellent production topped off with the uniquely expressive vocals of LaBrie. There are so many vocal hooks on this album especially in the choruses that it almost sounds like a form of pop metal but it is a great sound that suits LaBrie very well. There is some screaming but it is used much more sparingly than on Static Impulse and it mixes in so much better showing that LaBrie and his production team clearly took the advice of fans who wanted more clean vocals and a better mix of screams.  The only slight negative is the simple lyrics that are often cliche but it seems that Peter Wichers wrote most of it so I can't take away too much from LaBrie who sings them well. The band is the same winning combination used on Static Impulse and features the awesome guitar skills of virtuoso Marco Sfogli who really lays down some amazing riffs and solos, Matt Guillory on keys and backing vocals, Ray Riendeau on bass, and the killer drumming skills of Peter Wildoer on drums and screams! Highlights include the rocking metal opener \\"Agony\\" which sets the mood nicely, the amazing verse riffs and powerful groove of \\"Slight Of Hand\\" which is the best song on the album, the massive chorus hook of \\"I Got You\\", the awesome production and memorable vocal melodies of \\"Letting Go\\", and the epic power ballad \\"Stay You're Still Mine\\". The European version comes in a nice digipack with the two bonus tracks \\"Unraveling\\" and \\"Why\\" which are in the same style as the rest of the album. Impermanent Resonance is another strong addition to James LaBrie's solo discography and is highly recommended to fans of high quality hook filled melodic metal - 4.5 stars.
B009X01C64|4.0|LIKES: I feel it protects my Kindle well.  It looks high quality.  I love the swivel option to stand the Kindle vertically or horizontally (this is the specific feature that prompted my purchase.)<br /><br />DISLIKES: The case did not SMELL like genuine leather...more like gasoline.  I have had it for a time now, and the smell has gone away, but it never did start to smell like leather.  HA.  The tilt for the horizontal/landscape setting is too &#34;high.&#34;  Even at the lowest notch, it does not lay down quite enough to be at a comfortable viewing position....it is much too upright.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with the purchase, and am not looking to replace it.  The dislikes are minor to me, now that the gasoline smell has gone.

B00AEBB9SM|5.0|This story is filled with profound meaning. It shows the psychological torture of a person being messed with by a system of manipulative control. This is  unique for people interested in philosophy, phenomenology or thinking about life. What must it be like to look at your life on the outside, distanced from everything you've known?<br />That's the question which sits on the heart during this film.

B001NLKWLW|4.0|This story is very sweet, sad & you will inevitably find a piece of its message that you can relate to. Within the story is a mystery that I solved long before the book's end but I was still able to find meaningful twists. Well developed characters, simple time period changes from chapter to chapter. all in all it was a great read.
B005LAII80|1.0|This Blu-ray version is region locked to Region A (Americas) so can't play here in Australia. My mistake though....sure it's a good 3D movie....
B007URVZJ6|1.0|Amazon (Kindle) would not let me navigate away from the review page without leaving a review, so here it is. This is just another way (long list) that Amazon manipulates you.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is the best game I have played in a long long time. Can't wait till the next level. Hurry up you guys.
B002O3Z4Y8|5.0|saw the movie after reading the book, the book was much better but I was not at all disappointed in the movie.Great cast.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed the storyline. Very captivating ! Nothing like anything I have read before. Highly recommended for the mature audience.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|The movie arrived on time and in great condition.  It's a great movie, even for preteens, this purchase allowed us to have a great family movie night.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is like temple run and subway surfers, but its more an obstacle course than anything else. Play this game. Better than temple run and subway surfers combined.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This product was delivered on time and it contains what they said. Good service and product. Thanks a lot :)
B004DLPXAO|5.0|and the screen is big enough to be able to read a book!  I love how the Kindle apps keep your place from device to device!
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|I love this game so much but I got all the way to level 6 and then it said I finished the game and I thought that was stupid because I love it so much. I think this game should never have an ending. I am completely bumbed out that it's only like 6 levels.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Always an awesome time whenever I play. My family and I always compete &amp; have a great time while playing. Definitely deserves 5 stars :D
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very relaxing but challenging enough to keep your interest trying to win. The game is addictive and I have a hard time stopping until I win.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|I love how this movie has Steve Carrell and Jason Segel and the second is awesome as well. Everyone should see both movies. The second movie was the #1 movie in the world and still #1.
B000FC10MU|3.0|I had real high hopes for this book based on the reviews I'd read and in the end I was let down. The main character's listless plodding along from beginning to end got mildly boring in spots. And i found the ending extremely anticlimactic. To each his own. But I doubt I'll be reading more Gaiman.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Sorry, I have never given 1 star before.  This app is fine if you don't require a ton of info!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Steamy and hot as always.  Syliva Day is one of my favorite authors.  As with all her Crossfire novels...this one keeps you on the edge of your seat and needing a cold shower.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I love Imagine Dragons. There are of course a couple of songs I could have done without. But, to order these one by one would have cost more than the CD itself. I am very happy with the price, shipping was fast and packaged perfectly, As a matter of fact I had a little bit of a hard time getting into it :) So perfect s/h.
B006GH6IWU|5.0|This video allows you to see the band as musicians and as people.  I enjoyed every minute. You will too.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|Boy was I ever!! This book really knocked my socks off! Don't let the benign and way too subdued cover art fool you! This book is a whirlwind of fantasm! (yeah I made it up!) I can't wait for the 3rd one to hit the stores!! Rothfuss Rocks!!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is the fourth time I have dl'ed this app on different devices.  It is actually very well done!  Yay!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app does exactly what is says.<br />It's alarm function is great. The snooze helps me when I accidentally set it too  early. The white noise function is great too. I would definitely recommend this app.
0345803485|5.0|Although this is not my usual pick of a book to read; I gave into the hype and I am glad I did, WOW!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I found Dexter through the books and have followed the character through the TV series. I have greatly enjoyed the creativity of the original author and all of the TV writers. There is something in the Dexter character we can all relate to. Thanks for the ride.
B00AEFZ6V4|5.0|My granddaughter introduced us to this movie which we thoroughly enjoyed!  Very creative and this movie is great family movie.  Imaginative and better than some movies we have seen lately.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I wanna write just like Rothfuss!! Let's get to it! We need more Rothfuss in our lives! His stuff rocks! I could read his work constantly! What great reads!! Thanks!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love minion rush a lot like subway suffers and the temple runs but I like this better. lags at times but I would recommend this game to anyone big 5 stars!!!!
B00005N5RM|3.0|This movie isn't particularly good. I bought it to complete my 1958 version (which is much better). This has its moments however and is sort of fun.
1451695195|5.0|Excellent book to read. Many medical professionals are so science based that religious experiences are difficult for them to grasp but this book, this book blew me away. Read it and you will agree! Well done
1781162646|5.0|I picked up this book on a whim one day while at Costco. I had read the reviews, both good and bad, but since I have read every Stephen King novel as they were published, (except Full Dark, and 11/63)I figured I had to pick this one up, and boy I am so glad I did! This is one of those books that you will read and re-read just to relive the memories that he brings up of the 1970's.  The setting is so perfect for a murder mystery, an old and failing family owned amusement park complete with an old fashioned ride through dark house ride called \\"Horror House\\" which sets the setting for a young girls murder and her ghost that haunts the park. But don't think you are going to be enveloped in Kin's traditional horror territory. Not being a huge fan of his non horror novels...... I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!  I flipped the pages as fast as i could, I cried, I laughed thinking back on being a kid and growing up.  Pick it up, you will not be disappointed.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Kleon gives sound advice, but he does not preach; more he pulls you in as a collaborator, an agent provocateur. He reverse engineers success, teaching you to use the tools, not of his art so much as his life. In the current vernacular he is a lifehacker and a maker. I love this book, and I could live by it.  I recognise some things I do already, and some things I should be doing already.
B000FBFMFW|5.0|I should have reviewed this when I first finished it. This trilogy is by far my favorite of the genre. (I'm a newbie so go easy!-) My uncle is a HUGE old school fantasy junkie whose been pushing me to try the genre for years. Well, I finally indulged with Martin's Fire & Ice books and fell in love. But Robin Hobb has closed the deal for me. I can't wait to read Fool's Errand!!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Love this! It has a low volume that increases and you don't get<br />startle because is suiting. Enjoy it and use it again and again.
B00DU74U74|1.0|The more I watch movies based on books by Stephanie Meyer the more I realize she must be a terrible writer. I can only say that, because I wouldn't honestly read a book. The start screen was a picture of a female, the protagonist--imagine that!--flanked by two males seemingly gawking at her. So, where have we seen a theme of two males lusting after a single female before? Twilight, of course. I didn't find Twilight to be as boring until the last one I watched, though.<br /><br />The premise itself doesn't make any sense. The world is taken over by advanced aliens that can occupy the bodies of humans, but then must share their memories and the host can even resist the alien parasite. The parasite can even be sympathetic with the host. Somehow there is still a resistance. They're able to conquer almost the entire world, but small pockets somehow survive. However, outside of the protagonist the other aliens all seem to be one, large monotonous group of drones that dress the same and work in environments where the entire set is replicated over and over in stainless steel tables and slim computers.<br /><br />Also, the \\"inside voice\\" throughout the movie really annoys me.
0811729117|5.0|I was looking forward to reading this book, and found myself not wanting the tales to end.<br /><br />Most accounts are not terribly in-depth, and are small unit to Battalion view, and the narratives give you plenty of feel for the action. I wonder if they had gotten to Otto twenty years earlier if there would have been more details and accounts, more maps. You can't help but find that Otto was deeply patriotic and driven by his initial refusal of service and small stature.<br /><br />I was also looking for insights into the legendary Tiger. Clearly here, as in the historic ambush at Malinava, when good, well trained and bonded crews were matched with well maintained Tigers the results were devastating to the enemy. The book also includes fascinating insight into the shortcomings of the Tiger - mostly technical and logistical, many from the factory floor.<br /><br />His views on the closure of the war and very real thoughts that there was a small window when American and German crews might be mustered to hold off the Russians were fascinating. He also tells of the stark differences in fighting crews of the Eastern Front versus the Western Front, and hints to the rivalry between his traditional Wehrmacht crews and those of the fanatical SS.<br /><br />All in all, a great read on the subject.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Very fun exciting game  fun for the entire family. It does try to get<br /> you to spend real money to move ahead.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I would have given 5 stars if the directions were a little clearer on certain levels. All in all, it was a good game. Much like the first Magic Academy, the premise is intriguing and challenging. It did get frustrating when you know you are hitting the code item but it just won't place properly. But still it was a lot of fun.
B003G4W49C|3.0|But I'm clearly a fantasy guy and not a sci-fi guy. I probably read this 3 or 4 months ago and I've not gone on to read any more of Orson Card's work although I probably will eventually. People rave about it, but it was just okay to me.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|This is the best Laptop holder Ive found on the Market. Its Really helpful at creating more work space since I can store things below it. BUY ONE!!!!
B004MC0FO8|5.0|this is a great app for music lovers. It has really changed my life. We play a music  trivia game at work now called name that tune with Shazam as the judge.
B002ONC9NC|5.0|I very much enjoyed this film. I thought that it flowed well and I liked the characters and all of that, BUT mostly it felt like a walk down memory lane. SIDE NOTE TO WOMEN READING THIS REVIEW: Haven't we all had that ONE man in our past whom we adored desperately, but whom we sensed was about to betray us and rock our world to it's foundation? If you answered \\"yes\\" to this question, then I suggest watching this movie. You just want to reach into the screen and grab Carey Mulligan's character by the shoulders and shake her, then hug her, and lastly give her some womanly advice.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|You should read this book for yourself, find what it means to you. Read it to begin a conversation with yourself about what you can do, or who you are, or to change something you do, or just to think about new paradigms. But read it. For me this is not a how to book, it is a what if book, and that is exciting.
B005MLP8E0|4.0|Never realized how directed this was to Hearst.  I understand there was a big feud generated by the movie.  Worth watching.
0312944926|5.0|The book was in like new condition. I anticipated a little more wear, but was pleasantly surprized. I appreciate the honesty.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I feel like this book was rushed and didn't make sense half the time!!! I read all the books back to back and the last 3 books were on a steady decline! I thought the characters were great and very strong and the worked well until about the 10th one! The author repeated a lot of information unnecessarily,  forgot what was said about characters in previous books and what powers/characteristics they possessed, so inconsistent! I was hoping Dead Ever After would be a strong come back for the characters and somehow all of the reoccurring characters would settle and live out their lives or die at least and there would be resolve and an ending that made sense, but the author brought back a bunch of significant characters from all previous books who didn't die but had no relevance after those books ended and threw them together in Dead Ever After to create a plot that made NO sense! I got so annoyed I had to stop reading the book because it was frustrating to spend so much time getting into a series only for the author to not give a crap on the last few books why not end them sooner and have a plot that made sense????!!!<br /><br />I mean Claude really??!!! like how could he ever really have any reason to hate Sookie?! The author could have used him to Sookie's advantage in a cool way but instead the character was destroyed! Sookie brought Sam back to life with a magical object she was supposed to be able to use on herself or someone she really loved and contemplated the many possibilities only to use it on impulse for her good friend and boss?!! Sam died, sure he was depressed for a few days but then he was back to normal and all of a sudden Sookie couldn't read his mind only emotions?  Most of the characters did not even have the same qualities they had in previous books as if she forgot what she said about them originally and they were completely different!! It doesn't make sense any of it! Total lack of imagination and consistency!<br /><br />We have no idea what happens to the most important people in Sookie's life!! Eric?!!?!!(I guess he left for Oaklahoma with a random queen he kept reassuring Sookie he wouldn't end up with??! After all the fighting for and over Sookie through out the series he just leaves with no fight or goodbye) Bill?!!?! (Oh he might be running around in her woods still with no purpose and even though he spent the whole series after Sookie ended things with him trying to profess his love...... did not even make an attempt to be with her after Eric left!????) Hunter maybe he's still ok? Maybe she'll see him again? ( why even put him in the book at all?)Tara?! (What did she have against Eric in the first place? he helped save her life!! But hey now that he's gone she can swing by and drop off dinner?!) Alcide(he must have made off with the Kandace woman never to even try to get with sookie in a sincere manor) Jason got married(other than that I guess nothing significant happened in his life after Mel) Claude came back but Niall never did and didn't notice he left faery???! It was great Pam became Sheriff if Eric wasn't going to be anymore, but she was the one rooting for Eric and Sookie in a non obvious way from the beginning. She even almost defied Eric whom was her maker, but also friend, someone she respected, loved and defended for hundreds of years, she had nothing to say about Eric just leaving Sookie that way? Dont worry he did leave some conditions but none of it means Eric really cares what happens to Sookie he's just showing his new Queen, he openly never wanted to be with in the first place, that he'll be loyal to her for not only 100 but 200 years?!!?!! Sooo not Pam!<br /><br /> Eric and Sookie should be together with fairy magic or something that could make reading these books a worthy of my time! I mean why talk about their relationship for 9 books only to trash their original characteristics and make them not live up to who they were once they finally were able to be together! Eric never caredabout anyone other than Pam like he did Sookie but now in this book there were other people and Another child?? They faced waaaay worse situations and circumstances and prevailed and grew closer afterwards only to have a bogus contractual negotiation started by Eric's dead maker tear them apart in the last two books?!!!?!?!! For fearless and cunning Eric to be so afraid of what Felipe who was so distant and a non threat in previous books because he defended himself against Victor was such a let down! For Eric not even say by to Sookie before he left is just crazy! From the time Eric met Sookie he was on a mission to make her his. He showed time and time again he was worthy of her affections by his actions and in the ruthless manor he went about saving her and being there to make sure she was ok when he owed her nothing, he even jeopardized his position and reputation in ways to keep her but not this time! No matter what they were faced with( the witches, russell, Debbie, the Queen of LA, Andre, victor ect.) they prevailed and the plot built up for them to be together. Sam is just a lazy way out to say the least! Bill, Alcide, Quinn would have all made more sense! WHATEVER! Booooooo!
B00D8RYV52|5.0|I downloaded this on my phone. As soon as I get home from work every day my son grabs my phone and yells out &#34;car fixing game!&#34; It keeps him occupied for a good 15 minutes so mommy can put her things down and regroup.
B008220DGE|1.0|Since there are over 5oo reviews for this film, I'll get right to the point: IT WAS TERRIBLE! I suffered through the first 30 minutes of the movie- (the first 7 of which were just disgusting)-, and then I simply couldn't take it anymore. The viewer should be able to glean the POINT of the movie after 30 minutes, don't you think? The movie just rambled on aimlessly, only showcasing Joaquin Phoenix's degenerate pervert character. (By then, I didn't care if he was redeemed in the end or not. Enough was enough.) For actually good performances by Philip Seymour Hoffman watch \\"Capote\\" and \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\". Sing along and watch \\"Walk the Line\\" for a stellar performance by Mr. Phoenix. Catch Amy Adams in \\"Enchanted\\" to see her flawless performance as a \\"Disney\\"-type princess. Enough said.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|As usual there are many characters to remember but an interesting plot and so enjoyable to read! No one does romance as well as Jane.
B00BVMXBVG|5.0|If you want to watch something that does not have super special effects and bombs blowing up or cars flying through trucks or spaceships and robots, give this series a try. You will get one thing and that is some of the best acting you will ever see. Again, I will not give away the plot as this has been done. I will only say this actress is going to be around for a long time. She is worth watching and the camera work is a miracle. My daughter recommended this series to me and I decided after reading so many reviews, I wanted to own it and watch it at my leisure. It is two discs full of episodes. It flows from one to the next. This is the way television should be. Thank you BBC for giving us intelligent story lines and great casts once more. Amazon, thanks for getting it back in stock. It was worth the wait.
0743497465|3.0|Based on the condition listed, I had anticipated a used but good condition item. What I received was well worn. I can still read it, but it would have been nice if it was in condition described.
B000002672|5.0|I use to have this album on cassette back in the 1980's, and I loved it. I tried looking for the CD at various used record stores, but could never find it.  I finally got it here on Amazon.  I have to say, it is still a fantastic album, just a pure joy to listen to.  Accept is know for their song &#34;Balls to the Wall&#34;, and while a great tune, I have to say, this is my favorite Accept album.  I highly recommend it, and if you do buy it, then get ready to head bang for hours!
B0091QS88K|4.0|My 3 year old loves this game. As a professional Chef I believe it is very close to real cooking. He can play cook and we can talk about what he is doing. He gets excited about making smoothies with me in real life now due to this game.
B006QVRVJK|5.0|I snickered throughout this movie, because it's so true of parents in general. No way could OUR child have done this....it must have been YOUR child! The face-off between the parents was well-paced and hilarious. Jodie Foster was fantastic in her earnestness and shrill denial of the guilt of her child. I highly recommend this one!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|So many twists and turns in this - had a hard time putting it down.  Well written and hope there are love lives like this one actually out there.
B00BUT5IAC|5.0|I was prepared to be bored by the new AIC, and was pleasantly surprised at the focus of the group. They just made a record that was pure AIC.<br />If you're still hung up on Layne, too bad. They are forging ahead.<br />One of the best  Amerrican rock bands around today, that people sleep on in America.<br />If you're a fan you need this album!
B0083GDLL8|5.0|Great music, a real classic! and  I like using the cloud to easily transfer my music to my mobile device
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Awesome movie! It goes to show never give up hope. It’s my all-time favorite movie, truly a classic.<br />Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman amazing actors.
B00D6QU6RW|4.0|Not always one that was crazy about the boy band craze as it was back in the day, I will admit that I was and still am a fan of the BSB.  Having a bit of pride in my hometown boy, Kevin Richardson, I was disappointed a few years back when he left the group. But thrilled to hear that he had come back for this anniversary of sorts.  I will admit being a little biased toward the band, having gone to high school with Kevin and cheering on a small town boy from Estill County who has made his town proud.  (So please forgive my bias.)<br /><br />With that being said, BSB's bring a mature sound that strikes a balance between the new mature sound and the old boy band pop that we all liked from them back in the day.<br /><br />The song \\"In a world like this\\" brings back the memories of some of their best pop from their earlier days with its catchy beat.  The tracks like \\"Madeleine\\" give the guys a chance to sing without a lot of overriding musical effect.  \\"Show `Em (What You're Made Of)\\" is also one that has become a favorite of mine as well.<br /><br />There are some new things here and some familiar things here as well, with some working better than others but as a fan of BSB like I am, I think this is a good album and worth a listen.
B00CWIMVDW|1.0|I suffered through 3 episodes of this show with an acid-filled stomach, and then it became too much for me to bear. I do watch other crime-solving shows, but there was something just insidiously....evil about this one. I understand on an intellectual level that the premise of the show is clever, but it wasn't enough to overcome the disturbing feeling that stayed with me for hours after I watched an episode. I cannot POSSIBLY be the only ex-viewer who felt that way. Films and TV shows are getting more and more disgusting and extreme, to the point where I wonder if Hollywood will make actual \\"snuff\\" films sometime in the not-too-distant future, in order to maintain the sick thrill for the viewer. This is one show that will have to go on without me.
B00846REIS|5.0|Much better than Fifty Shades series and not sure why I had not heard about this author before now.  Deals with some big issues in families and personal experiences of main characters.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is so fun i play it over and over i love the minions. I named my minion Kevin. Totally get this game!!!!!!!!!!
B002BVYBBK|4.0|This is the one that started it all the deleted secens could be a little bit better all in all a good movie
B00DCRE7M0|4.0|For DT fans like me, this year is one that I have eagerly looked forward to, with a new DT album in the horizon and also James Labrie's new solo album out now, what else could I ask for.  I have always thought that Labrie has one of the best and most unique voices in rock/prog rock.  And after getting a first listen, I have not been disappointed in this album.  Although there are some songs that maybe are tailored to radio, this is quite possibly the best solo work to date from Labrie.<br /><br />Track listing:<br /><br />01. Agony<br />02. Undertow<br />03. Slight Of Hand<br />04. Back On The Ground<br />05. I Got You<br />06. Holding On<br />07. Lost In The Fire<br />08. Letting Go<br />09. Destined To Burn<br />10. Say You're Still Mine<br />11. Amnesia<br />12. I Will Not Break<br /><br />European bonus tracks:<br /><br />13. Unraveling<br />14. Why?<br /><br />The album starts out with the single, \\"Agony,\\" which is one of the higher tempo songs on the album with James and Peter Wildoer both doing vocal duties. \\"Slight of Hand\\" has some interesting and powerful drums and is a really solid song overall. The ballad \\"Back on the Ground\\" and \\"I Got You\\" are also great tracks that you will be humming.  \\"Holding On\\" gives you an electronic mixed with guitars similar to some of his past songs but is solid as well.  \\"Letting Go\\" has a nice groove to it and utilizes both clean and screamed vocals with a solid guitar riff.  \\"I Will Not Break\\" also sounds familiar with its in your face \\"speed guitar\\" riffs and fast vocals.  Several other songs have catchy lyrics as well but my favorites that have me playing them over and over are \\"Agony\\", \\"Back On the Ground\\", and \\"I Got you\\" but I really find nothing that I don't like on this album as I have played it over and over all day.<br /><br />The European version has two bonus tracks, \\"Unraveling\\" and \\"Why\\".  Disappointing they were not included in the American release at least at the moment anyways as I thought the ballad \\"Unraveling\\" was one of the highlights of the album.  \\"Why\\" also is good as far as bonus tracks go as well.<br /><br />Labrie's vocals are solid as usual and the lyrics are good as well and has a familiar sound from his past solo albums and DT albums.<br /><br />I for one am enjoying this album and fans will not be disappointed.  Those that aren't familiar with Labrie's solo work or even DT should give this album a spin, you might find yourself becoming a fan.eling\\" was one of the highlights of the album.  \\"Why\\" also is good as far as bonus tracks go as well.<br /><br />Labrie's vocals are solid as usual and the lyrics are good as well and has a familiar sound from his past solo albums and DT albums.<br /><br />I for one am enjoying this album and fans will not be disappointed.

030758836X|1.0|I could not believe all the hype about this book once I actually read it. There is just NO WAY that most of the events in this book would ever happen! I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes in disgust throughout this novel, due to the plot holes and the gross, lewd parts of the book. Why do some female authors feel the need to compete with male authors in a \\"gross-out\\" and dirty-word contest? I read this to the end only because I kept thinking that there MUST be some great plot-twist or surprise in store for me, since so many readers liked the book. Sadly, it was just pure crapola all the way to the end. What a tremendous waste of my time...and YOURS!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Much better writing than Shades of Gray.  Story line was good and kept you intrigued to see the relationships build.
B009WUBERW|5.0|There you go all the action you can handle. Classic action stars of the day all in one film. The streaming was pretty good . Will be better soon with Google streaming. Thank goodness. Then we will whatch again.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I used to use my Kindle Fire for reading but I have since given it to my oldest son. I recently got a new phone with a larger screen and I love having all my books available anytime I want them! Awesome app, highly recommended!
B002AT4K9Q|5.0|Always enjoy good sequals where everyone comes back to reprise their roles in movies and would recommend this movie to all
B00CRPZXFI|5.0|This is a spectacular album, very diverse and so much fun! I saw the film and personally was not impressed. I thought it tried to hard & would have appreciated more authentic 20's music instead of what Baz had added. However, the music on its own is so spectacular and well done, even the film clips added into beats is just brilliant. I fell in love with this album during the first song.
B00BOXZAJ8|3.0|I don't know...This movie isn't exactly bad, but I had a hard time making it through to the end. I'm a big fan of sci-fi and fantasy films, so I stuck with it thinking something good must be coming up....but NO. The love story wasn't terribly strong, and I really didn't feel invested in the couple's future (which you MUST feel in a great love story). Parts of the upside-down world were interesting and kind of cool, like the office scenes, but overall I found it distracting to the storyline. If you had to miss this film, it wouldn't be much of a tragedy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|5★★★★★I LOVE THIS GAME BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!!!!!!!! IF U DONT THEN WELL U R GOING TO MAKE ME CRY me and my brother fight over who's gonna play even though it is ★MY★ kindle fire
B0017SWPXY|5.0|One of those books you can't put down and finish reading at 1 in the morning!  Awesome thanks for sharing!
B003PBB4ME|3.0|Not very stable with an LED light on top.  I wouldnt trust it to remain stable on a table or flat surface. However, it makes for a great walk around rig if you are mobile while taking video.
B0085A9J18|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this movie. I saw the trailer and said I would give it a shot! Well, needless to say I got it in two days and watched it 4 times. Wow talking about a kick butt from start to finish. Don't get me wrong it's different than Bruce Lee's movies but I loved every minute and it had a decent plot also.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I can connect to and operate my computer from tablets or phone. Very convenient and well worth it. No problems after 9 months of having it.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Billy Conolly runs away with the entire thing, in my opinion. He is just so delightfully wicked and droll, and I think he had the best lines. My favorite part is where another rest home-resident is trying to spit out a sentence and is using a lot of hand gestures; Billy Conolly basically says to him \\"Give us a clue...is it a movie, a book, or what?\\" I laughed so hard that I threw myself backwards on my bed and nearly smacked my head on the wall! I thought the film also highlighted the fact that people's petty jealousies and insecurities don't disappear just because we get older. The music in the film is beautiful too. I just adored it.
B000NY12LO|4.0|Jodi Picoult's novels are always page turners, this one no exception. Good book, some slow spots, but overall great read.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Its great I like the fact that it pops up at the top tell u the weather so its great for on the go
B002JVWQSW|5.0|I missed the whole first season on TV so I am now caught up. I laugh out loud all,by myself while watching! Great writing and acting.
B002VWOMN6|5.0|I am not going to repeat the details and write-ups regarding the Director's Cut. I loved the original, but there were small details left out that were clarified by the extended scenes, things that make you say, &#34;Oh, that's why.&#34; once you see them.<br /><br />I purchased this with the Complete Original Soundtrack (3 disc set). It is amazing the difference between the two movies and soundtracks, The extended movie and soundtrack go well together.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is the book that got me through alot. Amazing to feel so connected to characters like these. They all symbolize hope, friendship, personality, and overcoming fears!
0142421715|3.0|I liked the first book \\"Matched\\" quite a bit and thought it was a clever premise. This second installment, while not terrible, just drags. I realize that it is a \\"middle\\" book, and so most plotlines can't be resolved, but geez...did they have to spend most of the book in the boring canyon? And for heavens sake, after all of the angst and effort Cassia and Ky put forth to find each other, why did they separate??? The reason given in the novel didn't seem sufficient to me. Would Romeo and Juliet have willingly left each other because they didn't agree on ONE thing? I think not. Anyway, I'm looking forward to all of the plot resolutions and sweet pain of the star-crossed lovers in \\"Reached\\". I hope it's better than this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I didn't want it to look like a bad game because it is awesome but I think that we need updates
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Love this film. From beginning to end it was funny, original, and very clever. The actors are amazing in it also.
B009AMAJPA|5.0|This movie surprised me because I did not expect it to be so well acted and the scenes to be so well made.<br /><br />It is basically about a Man and Woman with scars who by helping each other help themselves.<br /><br />I highly recommend you give it a look.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Really great show with lots of juicy characters, noteworthy plots, and high stakes conflict. Interesting time-period elements too. Watch it!
B00CPLGGXM|2.0|-------------Update on Hybrid Crossfire---------------<br /><br />I was about to purchase a 7750 to improve gaming performance since I want to at least play some MMORPG on the platform. I almost made purchase on a 7750 before I read this review from Tomshardware. Read through it and it will save you loads of bucks.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Long story short. The Hybrid Crossfire/Dual Graphics is broken. It is entirely up tp AMD to fix it at their software's end. Until they fix it, DO NOT invest in the Hybrid Crossfire mode!<br /><br />It took AMD quite some time to fix the frame latency problem on the discrete GPUs, hopefully Tomshardware's article will get AMD moving to fix this again.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Let me start by saying a few good things about this processor. First, it is affordable. It seems to be a good choice for a HTPC build.(I will get to this \\"seems\\" later) Second, it has a good IGP. The 384SP IGP can handle even some basic DX11 games. Here is my system build:<br /><br />A10-6800K<br />Thermalright AXP-100 cooler<br />GSKill DDR3-2133 8GB<br />Asrock A85X Extreme4-M<br />Seagate 1TB<br />Antec Green 380Watt<br />Silverstone SG02-F<br /><br />With latest drivers I managed to get P7323 in 3DMark Vantage and 10892 in 3DMark06.<br /><br />Sadly, the good thing about this processor ends here.<br /><br />Now to the bad part. For a budget orientated system/HTPC, you dont want it to run too hot. The 6800K generates huge amount of heat when under full load. That little 70mm heatsink must be a joke. Most HTPC has limited cooling capabilities. When in full load that little 70mm stock cooler sounds like a jet plane taking off. AND, even with that amount of noise it cannot cool the APU at all. A horribly made aluminum heatsink plus a tiny fan is not a good cooling solution to an APU that has a 100Watt TDP. With the stock fan, a loaded 6800K can reach almost 80C(in a 25C room temperature). So you wanna watchyour movie without that noise? You will have to invest an aftermarket cooler. AMD should have just shipped the APU alone without that terrible cooler. At least this way we wont have to pay for that noisy useless thing.<br /><br />As a mentioned before, the IGP is decent. However, this depends entirely on the RAM speed. AMD posted some lovely numbers about how these APU can perform well in modern games. Well, you should pay attention to the memory modules they use. To get OK gaming performance,you need at least DDR3-2133 memory. High end memory for a budget build, that aint exactly what customers are looking for. When you pair this APU with some cheap DDR3-1333 mem you will feel how sluggish the system can be.<br /><br />Last, the APU has terrible efficiency. It has much higher idle power consumption that intel's entry level i3-3225. The load power consumption is about 135watt, twice as much as intel's 3225. From this point of view, 6800K aint that great for a HTPC.<br /><br />6800K is actually a 5800K with a tiny bump in frequency. The Piledriver core design cannot compete with intel's entry level CPU in every single aspect---performance, temperature, power consumption. You want a good HTPC processor then this is NOT your best bet. Go get a APU-6700 or even 5800K. Those are cheaper and will get the job done just fine. If you have a little larger budget, then get an intel i3 platform with a discrete GPU.<br /><br />AMD's richland apu lineup is shockingly underwhelming. Now I just hope their next gen APU offering will at least be better in heat control as well as efficiency.
B005XQ973M|4.0|Absorbing and terrifying.  It is a disgrace that this atrocity has never received the international attention it deserves. It also highlights a troubling aspect of modern Japan which seems never to have acknowledged the horror they inflicted on all of Asia and the Pacific.  It is a powerful book that is riveting and a page turner.  It is doubly tragic that author Iris Chang died at an early age and could not complete other works.  In her brief life she added more to our understanding of a dark chapter of history than many people contribute in a full lifetime.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|This book has one word to describe it &#34;EPIC.&#34; I loooooooooooooove it. It is thrilling,exciting,and fun. Book four is comming out the day after tommorrow and I can't wait to read it.
B002ZG9846|5.0|So excited that I finally got this on Blu Ray, this movie is amazing and cannot wait for the next one to come out
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Here is a story of the man who threw his heart into his music. I left after watching this film, thinking he is a man who has found peace in himself, who is kind and has reached what we all strive for..a kind word, a forgiving nature....having all he needs in his self  and wanting nothing.  I love his music....his words....
B0084B1T8Y|4.0|Good book. Easy and fun to read even for an old lady. An old story that was enjoyable to pick up and read again.
0316228583|1.0|I tried to approach this novel as if I had never read Rowling's Harry Potter books, as if this story was written by a new author whose work I had not read.  I would be disappointed if this were an author new to me whose previous works I had never read, but with my experience of reading Rowling's Potter series, I am doubly disappointed.  The best I can say about this book is that it is well-crafted.  Rowling seems to follow all the rules a student learns in a first year creative writing workshop, but like those novice writers, following all the rules doesn't breathe life into the story, which is devoid of life.  I simply don't give a crap about any of these characters or what happens to them.  Yes, as some reviewers have pointed out, there are some poetic lines here and there, but even a blind hog can find an acorn now and then.<br /><br />I can understand why Rowling might want to write something completely different from the Potter series.  That's fine, but perhaps she could have done something transitional--something between the pure fantasy of the Potter books and the gritty realism she portrays in this adult novel.  She would do well to think about the kind of work that Neil Gaiman has written, particularly The Ocean at the End of the Lane.  This short Gaiman novel seems, on the surface, to be a young adult novel in that the main character is seven years old.  However, it is written from the point of view of an adult looking back on his seven-year-old self, remembering a fantastical experience that he endured at that age.  The novel is full of the poetic language that reviewers complimented Rowling for in her first adult novel, but also contains realism.  Don't buy Rowling's novel.  Buy the Gaiman one instead.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I haven't watched it yet but I will when I get back home. I loved season 2 and look forward to seeing both seasons. it's a shame they cancelled the series.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent book!  One of the best books I've read in a long time. It keeps you interested from start to finish.
B0075MFS9Y|2.0|Bought this CD thinking it would be great! The hit song is the best song on the CD (a few others are OK). The studio quality is poor and it sounds like a band playing in someone's garage with a simple recording device. I'm sure the band is good but they needed a better quality studio and should have utilized all the band instruments instead of picnic style solos. Might have been good in the 60's during the Bob Dylan era but today demands better studio and instrumentation. Sorry, some might like the backyard natural novice sound, but I like the polished effect. I use to play in a band too!
B0019IMVDG|1.0|We could not hear or see this movie well enough to judge the movie.  I think there was something wrong with Amazon's copy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really fun it's entertaining as well. I recommend this game.. it is also good to play if u are bored in the car

B00AYR2FQ6|5.0|and there has been some great competition. I've been a long-term but somewhat unenthusiastic fan of Phosphorescent. His obvious similarity (without being derivative to a fault) to Will Oldham is what drew me in, but I always felt that he had a great deal of unexplored potential in his own right. This is the quality of work that I had imagined, and much more. The invocation will envelop you in a sunny trance before Song for Zula, the album's first single, which has a Dylan-esque feel to the lyrics. Terror in the Canyons, while its lyrics meander into incomprehensibility at times, might be the best song in recent memory.  It's awesome to see Houck live up to his potential; he's completely won me over with Muchacho.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|The MGS Legacy Collection contains a code voucher for Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear Solid VR Missions to be redeemed in the PSN store. The two disc set contains MGS 2, 3, 4, Peace Walker and the motion comics as well as the original Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake. If you haven't gotten the HD Collection, the Legacy Collection is the way to go for the full MGS experience. It should be noted that the Legacy Collection uses the HD Collection discs, but relabels them.<br /><br />The edition from Amazon's preorder contained an artbook that collected various promotional images and posters of the games throughout the years. There is also a two page promo for the upcoming MGS Ground Zeroes.<br /><br />The gameplay is as sharp was it was when it was first released and if you've played them all before, you're likely to get a bit nostalgic. That being said, the controls for the earlier games are not as tight as the more recent titles, but it doesn't take long to adjust to that.<br /><br />If you're a Metal Gear Solid fan and haven't bought the MGS HD Collection, then this is the set to get.  The Snake family has a hell of a legacy.
B00BESM14U|3.0|Well acted but a depressing story.  A dark movie.  If you are in the mood for a sad story, you will not be disappointed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Oh my goodness!!! I've had this for about 3 days, and I am in love already!! I heard people at school talk about it and I wanted to try it out, and I turned out to love it!!!<br />If I could I would rate this 1,000,000 stars!!Totally recommend!!
B00479SVBU|5.0|I've owned this product for a few years now, between road trips and daily commuting, I drive quite a bit and there's only so much radio I can bear to listen to, not to mention driving on road trip in remote areas where all you can get is some static-y country music. But I've driven all over the US with this thing, and it's preformed beautifully so far. Even in downtown Chicago, where I commute weekly, this thing outpowers everything else, which is the issue I've had with other FM transmitters.<br /><br />At first, I only used it with an SD card to listen to my music. As the trust grew, I started experimenting with how else I could use it. It's nice that I can use the AUX cord and hook it up to my phone. Me and my husband have (many times) sat and watched Netflix through my phone with the AUX playing the movie through my car speakers. It's pretty awesome (but probably not really necessary for most users). I used to hook it up to my iPod with the AUX cord to listen to audiobooks because my ipod would pick up where you left off in the book but once my ipod broke I turned to my Soundfly. Once again, it didn't dissappoint. I loaded the book on an SD card and use the &#34;bookmark&#34; feature on the remote. Next time I get in my car, BAM, right where you left off.<br /><br />Beautiful! On a similar note, it did not work well with the USB and my ipod. I still don't really understand that aspect of it, but didn't need to since everything else worked like a dream.<br /><br />There's also a &#34;cool&#34; factor to this. All of my friends and anyone who steps into my car is always surprised about my Soundfly. It looks good and is as easy to use as you need it to be, but it also has more complex features you can choose to use if you like.<br /><br />Drawbacks?<br />I'm on my second (but breaking my first one was entirely my own fault, it had nothing to do with the design or product) but the first one I had was VERY hard to see the lit screen in the daytime. This second one may just be different (maybe they fixed it?) but I can now see it in all lights, even super sunny days.<br /><br />The only other drawback, which is really just nitpicking, is if you drive short distances all the time. The music picks up where it left off (at the beginning of the song) so if you drive less than 4 mins or so (like running errands) each time you keep hearing the same bit of the same song, over and over. Of course, you can change the song (which is why this is nitpicking) but sometimes it drives me crazy when I'm driving locally.<br /><br />Definitely not a reason to skip buying this wonderful product. I even take this with me when I'm driving other cars, rental cars and friend's cars because I can't live without it!<br /><br />I reccomend it to just about everyone, especially if you drive a lot or go on long trips. This product is just amazing. The price is very reasonable, the design and function is great, and the transmitter is a BEAST!<br /><br />Wonderful product, when I enevitably break this one (because breaking stuff is a little known talent of mine), I will buy another and another again without  a moment of hesitation!
B00D3LA71K|1.0|I just watched this movie and I can't believe the reviews averaged more than 4 Stars. It has to be the worst movie I've seen this year. I'm a big fan of Matthew McConaughy and while his acting is super, I can't believe he took on this movie to further his career. With a running time that exceeds more than 2hrs, the movie is way too long for the story line which invariably makes it overly boring to watch. And to make matters worse, the ending is so very predicable.

B00DGMVJAO|2.0|The director missed an opportunity to make this movie better acted and the plot more interesting.  Looked like the director took the headlines of the story and quickly slapped some special effect to cover the lack of directing, writing and acting.

B00AKFG15S|2.0|Jeffrey Archer is at a very low ebb in this third of what has been a great series. The subjects are almost glossed over. However if you have read the first two, then you are compelled to read this one!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|After the download it plays the intro scene and then continues to load for hours, even after downloading the additional file.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|I read this because it had recently come out in theaters and the trailer looked decent so I thought &#34;Why not?&#34;. Don't do it. It was an interesting concept pulled off sporadically. The ending was a little all over the place and I disliked the ending. Granted I didn't see it coming but I disliked it just the same.

0345529057|5.0|No problems with page cutoffs or repeat chapters but the binding is still as weak as any other paperback so treat it with care - 800-1000 pages of holding a book open wears it down.
B007FTZDN8|4.0|I love to listen to the TED Talks and this is one way to do.  Great APP ans easy to use.
0399159347|5.0|This book was terrific!  I was hooked to the very last page and, in fact, the last few pages present a number of \\"what ifs\\" that were fascinating.<br /><br />I'm not really fond of the term \\"beach book\\" because it implies something that lacks substance.  I work in a bookstore and when customers ask for a beach book I always have to dig a little deeper to see what they really want...something very light to pass the time in the sun or something to get lost in while spending time at a beach house.<br /><br />At the start of the novel, the story focuses on the Fitzpatricks and then brings in some other people/families. The other people in the story are a bit awkwardly introduced and it takes a couple of chapters to see how the stories are integrated.  But....Wow, how they become integrated!  Before long, you learn that what happens in one family has a rippling affect in others.<br /><br />There are some ethical questions in the book that will make you think about how you would deal with them.  My husband was a bit surprised when I turned to him and asked, \\"If you found out I had killed someone as a teenager, would you turn me in?\\"  You will see how your first and instinctual reaction might not be the best thing to do.<br /><br />I also really liked this author's \\"Hypnotist's Love Story\\" so if you haven't read it, don't miss it.
B00A7YZ1KI|3.0|For the last novel in the sookie stackhouse series it seems clear that the author was running out of ideas. It probably best that this was the last because i dont think it can be taken any further. But in saying that i have enjoyed the series

140006922X|1.0|Too much of this book is spent wit the author trying to impress us with his scholarship, telling us about other good reads.  He is also apparently unaware of much scholarship of the Jesus seminar.  Some good insights but Marcus Borg, Dominic Crossen, and Albert Nolan are much better for persons being introduced to the historical Jesus. Lowest rating I have given a Kindle book: one star.
B009SS9632|4.0|After reading the fire and ice series i was looking to see what else the author had done. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and could hardly put it down. It explores a lot of social issues and puts into question what would one person do if they had immense power at their finger tips
0671449028|5.0|My daughter is 17 months old and I am big on encouraging reading at an early age. She has LOTS of books, mostly hard cover at this age so she can grab them, manipulate them and slobber on them.<br /><br />This book has funny and silly graphics of characters, cute and silly rhymes and also incorporates some rituals that are good for kids like brushing their teeth before bed and having a bath before bed. My daughter always picks this book out from the big stack and it's the one she has me read over and over and over again.
1416549447|5.0|The book provides a refreshing look at the world of running.  Old habits that have led to the last five years of more injury than healthy running are hard to break, but I'm starting to see the benefits.

B007XHWROK|1.0|As Justin Bieber attempts to become a mature artist a la Justin Timberlake, one is left with<br />the unmistakable impression that he has a long long long way to go. Even worse than the<br />childish lyrics is the complete absence of any sincere emotion of any kind.

B008JEJO88|4.0|Shoes were slightly larger than usual for size selected. However, when heel strap is in down position, it is tighter than usual. Overall, nice looking and solid quality croc.
B009NQLT0M|5.0|I own several of these type and they are the best money can buy.  They are great for multiple uses and are barely audible which I did not believe was possible with the amount of air they push.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|One of the greatest men to ever walk this earth! With Chris Kyle, Marcus Luttrell and other heroes that we don't hear about and whose names we don't recognize these are the guardians of the constitution and the warriors at the gate that protect our freedom and whose honor is without question! We owe them our gratitude, their families our prayers and above all the grace of remembrance and allegiance!
B0060D1PSM|5.0|Its old and the musical lyrics are a little odd but overall its a wonderful movie with Evita and Che.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|It's a shame the band had the issues it did.  Breaking up is never easy and the sound can never be the same.  But that's the music business.  That said, there are some great tunes here, and some stinkers.  Enjoy...
1612183956|5.0|To steal the dialogue from a Paul Rudd movie:  \\"Wow, just...wow!\\"  Couldn't put it down; a real edge of the seat thriller.  Mr. Crouch is one of the best authors out there!  I look forward to the next in the series.

B0091REZMW|2.0|Mystery Manor has challenges and rewards, plus a lot of interesting characters. I began having problems shortly after starting to play. I communicated all issues to GameInsight with screenshots documenting the issues.

B0006399FS|5.0|I'm happy to be the 1,554th person to post a review of this soulful and emotionally intelligent album. The band produces a drama with Bono's delivery (the album's protagonist)that makes me feel that I'm listening to more than an ensemble of musicians and a lead singer. Not a single song on the album is short of a brilliant composition.<br /><br />If you have rated this album below 5 stars, I recommend giving it a re-listen. This time, listen with a high end set of headphones. Close your eyes and see yourself in the studio witnessing the recording session. If after your re-listen, you still rate this album below 5 stars, I'd love to see your list of 5-star rated albums, regardless of artists or genre. I might consider adding some from your list to my collection.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|After being disappointed in the Case Logic DCB-304, this AmazonBasics Backpack for SLR Cameras was a delight.  It is roomy with adjustable compartments, lots of pockets.  Also it is lightweight, but strong construction and comfortable when carrying fully loaded.  Yep, it is a winner!!!
0989254607|4.0|Very suspenseful book! The author had me sucked into this book right from the beginning. The main character Sara Jones is trying to start a new life apart from her boyfriend who's family that is into criminal activity. She meets different people along her travels that lead her to another state where strange occurrences with spiders keep happening. A news team is there to cover the story and her ex and his family discover where she is. This is where the story gets real exciting and has you wondering who is good and who is bad!<br /><br />I don not like to reveal too much of a story to ruin it for other readers. In my opinion this is a must read for those who like books with twists and turns through out the book all the way to the end. I would love to see a sequel to this book, I think the author could keep this story going with a few more books.
B000FBJHEO|5.0|It is a visionary, thought-provoking, poem-liked fiction I have ever read. The prose is beautifully written, and the dialogues are extraordinary, poetical, and profound. They are full of philosophical sense, especially existentialism.<br /><br />Eric Parker, a 28-year-old billionaire currency speculator, needed a haircut. Regardless of all sensible and rational advises, he insisted to be on the one-way road to his preferred barber's, where his childhood memories kept safe, and where he could fall asleep mindfulnessly. On his ride slowly across Manhattan amid traffic jams and anti-capitalist protests, he didn't stop searching for \\"meanings\\" of this material world as he kept meeting with his people (IT consultants, arts consultant, chief of finance and chief of theory) discussing various issues. He wanted to acquire the Rothko Chapel, keep track of the yen, and he did his daily medical checkup as usual. Meanwhile, he intentionally to lose all of his money and belongings, bit by bit, piece by piece, just seems like he wanna get rid of everything and prepare himself for a fall, into an immaterial and metaphysical unknown.<br /><br />\\"He'd always wanted to become quantum dust, transcending his body mass, the soft tissue over the bones, the muscle and fat. The idea was to live outside the given limits, in a chip, on a disk, as data, in whirl, in radiant spin, a consciousness saved from void.\\"<br /><br />\\"He'd come to know himself, untranslatably, through his pain.\\"<br /><br />Eric Parker, he was no hero, he was no Icarus; he was only a meditator, having been thrown into the world.

B0063GORYU|5.0|Love it! I can customize the cards and background, and the picture quality is beautiful. I love being able to play Spider away from my desk. Highly recommend if you are a fan of Spider Solitiaire!
B001HN694K|3.0|I suspect the Pirates series ruined my ability to see Depp cast in other roles, but he truly is NOT the star of this movie anyway. I was very irritated that the music and other sound effects were so deafeningly loud while most of the dialog was done in whispers. If you turn it up load enough to understand the various fantasy characters, you will be blown out of your chair by the music/sound effects. But it was quite refreshing to see the courage Alice gains from this experience and I felt the best part of the movie was in the last five minutes (after she leaves Wonderland).
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|It was a lot of fun but it did take up a lot of my data ,it lagged , and it keep trying to get you to  purchase more coin s more diamonds etc  but  overall it was a decent game.

0143124544|4.0|Is it misleading to say, \\"I rarely read love stories\\" and then to review three in a row? Sorry about that. Maybe I'm more of a romantic sucker than I let on. Or maybe I only like well-written love stories and I've been finding quite a few of those lately? Time will tell.<br /><br />I don't know what made me request Me Before You -- oh, wait! Yes, I do. My friend Amanda added it to her to-read list on Goodreads, and I have large amounts of faith in her reading tastes. I'd seen it listed on NetGalley, scanned the description, and passed it by. Maybe I need to start paying more attention, because I almost missed out on this one.<br /><br />Me Before You is about Lou Clark, a girl whose family is engaged in an endless struggle to make ends meet. When she loses her job at the local cafe, Lou is forced to try out job after job before finding one as a caretaker to a paraplegic man. Will Traynor, her charge, is rude and abrasive every chance he gets, but somehow the two grow closer, each seeing the other in ways that no one else can. Without giving anything away...hm...how can I express this? Will makes a monumental decision, one that may jeopardize everything that Lou has so precariously built with him.<br /><br />It's very difficult to write about this book without writing about the deeper events and issues. But I rather enjoyed reading it without knowing what was coming, and I'd like for you to be able to do the same. So here's something safe to discuss: I found the chemistry between Will and Lou to be wonderful because of its gradual nature. There was a bit of a Jane-Eyre-and-Rochester vibe to it, for me at least. And even though in theory I can't stand intelligent, witty older men who are prone to being condescending, one of my best friends is one. And I do enjoy reading and watching characters like that (Edward Rochester, Gregory House, et al). So maybe I hate the condescension, but the rest of the attributes force me to somewhat look the other way? Who knows?<br /><br />Anyway. This story is believable and manages to somehow be a beautiful love story, a wonderful coming-of-age tale, and a social commentary all rolled into one. I had to hurry through one or two scenes to avoid crying, but the tears hit me in the final chapter. You'll see what I mean when you get there.<br /><br />All in all: Worth reading. So very worth reading.<br /><br />Note: I received a free copy of this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.r />Anyway.

B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|'Scarface' is one of my favorite movies and this book was AWESOME! I can't believe how much information and analysis there is packed into these pages. The interpretation of the film is amazing.I am planning on watching 'Scarface' again tonight with this book in hand. Not only is there plenty of (genuine) trivia and info but there's also a discussion of the film's meaning, why certain characters are named the way they are (`Elvira' means white - love it!!), why there are so many creatures mentioned in the movie (never noticed!) and there's so many interesting other points made like the fact that Nick The Pig is never introduced and that there are three stereotypical Jewish characters in the movie - Mel Bernstein, Seidelbaum and Frank Lopez, who is half-Jewish.<br /><br />What's great is none of this information is available on line or on any DVDs. The background on the film's development is fascinating and there's even an entire chapter on the Scarface premiere, with quotes from celebrities at the time, like Lucille Ball (!) and Melanie Griffith who was married to Steven Bauer back then. This book is a must have for Tony Montana fans. Trust me 'Scarface The Ultimate Guid'' is worth your money. \\"The eyes, Chico, they never lie.\\"
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Anita does a great job of describing a world that is way beyond our imagination and way beyond any adjectives we have in our vocabulary.  Loved the book.
B002P79KAC|5.0|This is a funny, funny show.  My older folks love as well as teenagers.  It is not however, for young kids.  My 8 year old saw the first episode and thought it was funny (which it was) but nothing after that was appropriate for his age.  Great writing and fantastic characters.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|FX has hit a few homers over the last decade plus. The Shield, Nip/Tuck & Rescue Me are the Crown Jewels. All off the air yet all will stand up for a LOoooong time to come. Chiklis nails this role of the bad guy you love to love(when you know you should hate him) This show by far, outshined it's small but loyal following.

1594202842|4.0|The story of a young Chinese mother trying to raise her children in a world full of distractons.  She took the non-permissive route and made her children focus on what their mother thought was important - was it worth it; I don't know.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Shows how each is so different from the other yet how well they match. Gives  good background on each to let us know why they are the way they are. Developed the possibility of romance and a great friendship.
B00821PCJS|4.0|This show appeals to my sci-fi nature. It makes me consider &#34;what if&#34; scenarios. We can't assume that our planet will always be uncompromised. I like watching the human dynamics of how people can work together in crises, even if they share different ideologies.
B009DCOU9S|1.0|The only reason I ended up with this game is it was the faotd. On my Kindle fire, it didn't work right. Then as I made my way through the game it got more and more stupid. Waayy too much talk to get through to the next level. there could have just been a short message before each level.<br /><br />Another thing that concerns me is that the game says it's over 80 MBs but when I checked the file size on my device it said 1.38 MB. It did take a while to download, but why won't the tablet recognize the entire game?<br /><br />No way this is a three dollar game. like someone else said recently; These developers need to stop being so greedy and realize their games are 99 cent games at best. Stop trying to get all your money from the first few people willing to pay.

(In that game, you assembled machines in the correct production-line order to create the widget shown.)  Fun and challenging.<br /><br />The ones with the grass and flowers took some trial and error before figuring out what happened for each action.  That can be frustrating.

B000RIWAVW|5.0|This film is a classic and the greatest horror film ever made, and not going into that.  I see a lot of confusing information out there to people about different editions, and as an avid fan that has all editions, thought I might help (I will update once the 35th anniversary comes out.)  There is a lot of hate for the remastered version, mostly because of bit rate.  I remember the first time that I saw the film, it was released by some company I have not heard of before or sense, and it was truly grainy 70's grind house quality.  I'm sure sure VHS copies still exist, and maybe are the truest representation of the film, but good luck finding that.  In 1999, Cundey released a remastered version.  I first saw it on VHS, and it was night and day from the \\"original\\" version I had before it.  It became prevalent with DVD as well, though due to the horrible bit rates, I will say that the VHS version is actually crisper than the DVD release.  This is due to having both the full and wide screen versions of the film on the same side of the disc.  Regardless of the fault, it is the best selling version of the film, and hasn't been taken out of circulation yet.  It is the version that I see when they take snippets of the film played for halloween and horror documentaries.  The film has horrible contrast and light levels and the whole thing just seems saturated in Black.<br /><br />The 25th anniversary version came out to \\"fix\\" the problem but took it almost too far in the other direction, increasing light and contrast levels to make the film almost completely different and taking away much of the suspense and darker elements of the mood.  It is still a gorgeous looking print of the film, and presented in divimax and very high bit rates.  It is also the only version of the film to offer commentary (albeit a lifted commentary from the laserdisc version that I have not seen).  It also has a very good documentary A cut above the rest.<br /><br />There is also an extended cut that is really the NBC television version of the film, that includes a couple of additional scenes that were intended to pad the running time and were shot around the same time as Halloween II.  The quality of the transfer is about the same as remastered version except for the additional scenes, that are still presented in widescreen version, despite it being a television version of the film.  Also present is the nudity that was obviously cut from the television version of the film.  They really looks like they took the remastered version of the film and inserted the additional scenes.  I will not comment too much on the quality of the scenes, as I don't like them (a lot of people who saw the film on tv for the first time think this is the definitive version of the film, and I'm not going to argue this point one way or the other) but I will say that they do not edit very well in terms of the visual look of the scenes.  They really do stand out.  There is also the inclusion of the plot point from the second film that Laurie is Michael's sister which is nowhere in the original version.  The extended cut has shown up in several places.  The 20th anniversary where it was coupled with the remastered version, as well as a stand alone and the 30th anniversary.  I bought the 30th anniversary because it was about the same price as the stand alone version of the extended cut and included the Blu Ray version of the film as well as the documentary 25 years of terror.<br /><br />Which brings us to the Blu Ray version of the film.  This is the definitive version of the film for me.  This film is taken from the 1999 Cundey remaster, and it looks amazing.  It is crisp and clear without suffering from being overly bright.  I have never seen a conversion from an old film look so good and brought out many of the details of a film that I had never seen and made the material seem fresh.  It might not be the version you remember because it is so clear and clean, but I love this version.  It also contains the Cut above the rest documentary.  I prefer the 25 years of terror documentary, but they really do cover much of the same ground, and the commentary is missing for some reason, maybe because carpenter demystifies much of the film.<br /><br />For the 35th anniversary they are creating a new Blu Ray with yet another remaster.  I am not sure why they are doing this, but I do know that Cundey is handling the remaster yet again, which really doesn't make sense because he did the last one, but considering that there is a huge difference between the VHS, DVD, and Blu Ray version of his 1999 film remaster.  Maybe he didn't have much say over the digital conversions, and since this remaster is only on Blu Ray, but I will update when my preorder gets here.  I do know that Carpenter has a new Commentary with Jamie Lee, so should be interesting to see what is difference.<br /><br />Update:<br />I just received the 35th anniversary in the mail.  I was a little disappointed in the packaging, pretty flimsy cardboard, though there is a nice booklet inserted.  The special features were very lack luster.  The night she came home was a huge disappointment and actually made me lose respect for Jamie Lee, and the new commentary was not as good as the one on the 25th anniversary divimax version.  Trailers and such are the same.  The Location featurette was short and forgettable.  None of that is really that important though, because the transfer of the film is amazing.  It gets everything right.  This is the definitive version of the film.  I can't imagine anyone that is familiar with the film not liking it (read, they didn't grow up with one of the other versions of the film as a child because they came to the film late).  The colors are much more rich so the contrast of the images doesn't have to be so high.  It almost looks bleached out like most of the old prints, but the color is able to shine through.  I actually found myself startled by some of the scenes because the dark was not as saturated that the frame position of the shape is much more stark.  I couldn't recommend this transfer enough.  The others are going to just be interesting side notes for collectors.so contains the Cut above the rest documentary.

Mitch Alborn has truly painted an amazing portrait of courage, hope, and inspiration. This book is a practical guide to finding and maintaining true satisfaction in your life, without &#34;working&#34; for it. Excellent service, prompt delivery, and competitive pricing.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|Ok, I confess---I AM a birder!  But let me say that friends and family who have seen this movie who are NOT birders love it, too.  It's about having a passion for something and about getting your priorities straight and Steve Martin, Jack Black and Owen Wilson are perfectly cast.  We rented it, loved it, bought it---I hope you will, too.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is amazing . Just like the original UNO but social and fun to play with other people .brings back old memories
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Although I do like this game, I don't like that I have to have coins to play. Big bummer when the coins run out. So I only rate this 3 stars.  This game would be much better if coins were not needed to play.

1476734941|4.0|It has become evident to military medical researchers that fasting needs more of a definition.  The optimal body condition is in a ketogenic state and this is achieved by reducing carbs to the point that the body no longer has glycogen storage in the liver and the body starts to produce ketones; ketone strips can be purchased to identify if one is in a ketogenic state.  The brain has been found to function at optimal levels on ketone fuel oppose to glucose (old school thinking supported glucose as brain fuel but current awareness proves that glucose has a negative impact on the body). The ketogenic state has shown to reduce cancer cells by half in conjunction with hyperbaric oxygen therapy 3x per week and cancer morbidity can be eliminated.  The point of all of this is understanding that calorie reduction is a vague idea unless more is understood on the type of calories the body requires.<br /><br />The Fasting Diet sounds like a great book and I intend to read it.<br /><br />Good luck!

B0089LOG02|4.0|I thought Orphan train was an excellent book.  The attention to detail created an atmosphere palpable to experiencing firsthand the trials that these orphaned children went through during an era where they were viewed most often than not as anything but cheap labor.  To not have anything literally and to be swept up into an unkind adult world, it is amazing that so many of these children appeared to have grown up to be responisible and &#34;healthy&#34; adults.  i liked how Ms. Kline used the boxes of  storaged items to relive and tell Vivian's story and create an atmosphere for Molly come to terms with her own adoption and sense of self. I admired both women, young and older for their tenacity and also adaptability for change. Vivian for having the nerve to finally meet her daughter and experience the new in the form of the internet, and Molly for taking responsibility and learning patience and that she has much to give and for growing up in how to deal with things around her.  I loved the romance in both their lives, I was also sad for Vivians loss of Dutchy.  In short, i would definately recommend this book!

B0010OIN90|3.0|My kid is very responsible but this watch breaks apart too easily. The toy car that it came with was cool
B000001DQI|5.0|I remember dancing to this music at a boy-girl dance in 7th grade at a classmates house. Young love, holding hands, being nervous and excited, exploring the dating scene. What a time in my life. I don't want to forget those moments. This music helps me to remember.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Although I did not realize this was a short story when I purchased it, the story was compelling and interesting.  Typical Steven King,
B00004VYF6|5.0|What can I say - it's a masterpiece, need no explanation.<br />Krasimo and conveniently made ​​in the form of a box of books with illustrations pasted too pleased.
B0067LY4WG|4.0|Thank you so much for the redemption. \\"Old Ideas\\" does a wonderful job of erasing \\"Dear Heather\\" from my mind. Almost. I was so very fearful that Leonard would \\"go on his journeys\\" without one more CD/album to define his career. This will do nicely, while I greddily hope for another yet to come.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun; not amazing, but fun.  Its hard to get energy but I guess it teaches patience.  I recommend it.
B000002O5L|5.0|Tom Petty did a great job going solo. This album was a great achievement with a lot of hits on it. Keep up the good work, dude.
0547848412|5.0|Bought this for my daughter who attends a private school.  She is in the 10th grade and It was a required book.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed reading this, but was not engrossed the way I was with The Kite Runner. I do love the way he builds these characters and makes you like them despite their flaws...brilliant.
B008S2BZ10|4.0|Great action and story line. Amzaing looking back on what technology was used doing that time of era vs. now.
B000GYI32M|5.0|Love it.  I got my husband addicted  to season 1 and he bought season 2, so now we watch it together.  It's always fun.
B00004YX39|5.0|Steely Dan is a mood setter type of band. They play tunes that sets the mood for Friday evenings when you are unwinding from a hard day and settling into a weekend. I recommend this type of music for those who can relate to this.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I think it was just fine before and was glad I had an option to turn off rewards. I could also do without the advertisements at the bottom.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|Favorite film of the 90's, Stellar cast. Makes  me wish I had and imaginary fiend for the great good of man or a penguin for a power animal!

B000001FKY|5.0|Def Leppard is a classic rock band with a lot of energy, drive, and punch. If you need a jump start from time to time, pick this album up. It does a frazzled mind good.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|it reminds me of tetris<br />its not a bad game<br />got to lvl 12 on the 2nd try with a score of 159200 with 1 7x and 3 5x
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I think this is a great game. I played it when i was little and now they have electronic game for it
B003XDVVO0|5.0|These Crocs work for going to the pool and for walking downtown. Recommended for persons who need comfort and a nice looking shoe.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This is one of the very best time travel movies I've ever seen, Owen Wilson is great as an accidental Time traveller who somehow keeps finding himself in Paris,France of the 1920's. With Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein and others who are Scott Fitzgerald and his wife, the original Flapper, and many other people who end up in the Paris of the 1890's to meet Toulouse Lautrec and finally a man who had an affair with another man and he ends up in the Kings Bedroom in Versailles. I give this company And this Movie 5 Stars each, and as usual this is another Amazon.Com company, it seems you can't fail with any purchases made with their companies
B009NY43NY|5.0|Spending time looking through the eyes of a small town girl with big time problems has been a simple pleasure. Following the storyline with interspersed moments of ice tea and sun bathing offered real escapism. The last two books before this one lost their formula. They felt hurried and I could no longer smell sunshine on a lush lawn on a hot day. This final book took us back to the beginning. It was a pleasure to be back in Bon Temps and I will miss it.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|Prior to watching Cloud Atlas, I knew absolutely nothing about the plot, context, or the original novel on which it is based. As you can imagine, I spent the first twenty minutes bewildered as to what was going on. As the film progressed and moments and characters began connecting however, I caught on. In my opinion, this is probably the most entertaining way to approach Cloud Atlas, so I'll keep my review spoiler-free for those that wish to do the same.<br /><br />Taking on a novel of this magnitude was a bold undertaking, and directors Tykwer and the Wachowskis ought to be recognized for it. This film should have been an absolute trainwreck, but it miraculously dodges this territory. That alone is worth 3 stars in my book, and I think you'll agree after watching.<br /><br />While I by no means loved Cloud Atlas, it is a very solid film. A medley of Hollywood genres (sci-fi, historical drama, sitcom, to name a few), it moves quickly between lofty sentimentality and fast-paced action, and thus avoids being excessively either. Again, Cloud Atlas could have easily veered into cringe-worthy campy-ness, but it doesn't to its credit.<br /><br />Speedy transitions however cannot disguise its extensive run time (close to 3 hours, yikes), and there are definitely lulls in the film where this is particularly evident. The film is also led by a strong cast (big names include Tom Hanks, Hugo Weaving, and Halle Berry), who play an average of 5 characters each, one of the unique feats of Cloud Atlas (if this last part is confusing, watch the film and you'll know exactly what I mean). Doona Bae, a newcomer on the Western film scene, is particularly notable, and I was happy to discover she will be starring in the Wachowskis' upcoming release.<br /><br />Past its varied offerings and genre-bending visuals, Cloud Atlas is a good film because it requires digestion. I finished the movie sort of dazed (again, it was long) and uncertain as to how I felt about it. Yet hours after it ended, I was still thinking about Cloud Atlas- the story, the characters, the ideas it propounds. I find I'm looking forward to re-watching it to catch things I missed on the first go. It is definitely not a film one watches and then immediately forgets, and it elicits a response from the viewer- good or bad. I believe that sort of impact is paramount to any truly influential film.<br /><br />If you're looking for something to break the monotony of the blockbuster film circuit, I strongly recommend Cloud Atlas.
B009Z5BPZK|4.0|They ended it the typical way wish it would have went on longer though. I figured out who GG was in season 5 they hint to it a lot.
B008JFUNYG|3.0|This remake was ok , for a remake. The Real one made with Bruce will be always the Best one of ALL!
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Great acting on Nicholas Hoult, Stanley Tucci, Ewan McGregor and Bill Nighy's part. I was drawn into the movie as soon as the been stalk started to grow and until the end.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book had an amazing ending. *SPOILER ALERT* Who knew that the rumor of katniss being pregnant would come true. Especially after w what they went through. This is an AMAZING book.
B000002JSH|5.0|Awesome album!The delivery was very quick also.The sound quality was excellent.I'e always been a fan of this band.There isn't bands like this around anymore.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|The young people of today don't have movies like this.. so bringing back a classic for a wedding gift for a new couple.. Great Idea......
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is fun for all ages and is a must-have for fans of endless running games mixed with fighting villains!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The sound is great, The graphics are great, and it is very easy game to play. I would recommend this game to anyone who has a smart phone or a tablet!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is great fun for all ages to enjoy. Easy to progress without buying any coins or acorns. Best download in ages.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really enjoy playing temple run and this most certainly is similar. Despicable Me is one if my favorite movies and this game encompasses the feel of the movie especially with how funny the minions are. I certainly recommend for hours of fun.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|My grand children looked at it but I was not interested in buying the game, maybe the kids will buy when they return home
1600610234|5.0|This is a beautiful work from this author.<br />I love drawing and this book is an opportunity to learn more.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Hi I'm not one who usually likes these kinds of games but I just saw the movie and its just like this awesome
B00CA9Y6Q8|5.0|The music is exquisite and beautiful, from start to finish. Not an inferior song in the bunch. The vocal and instrumental arrangements are beautiful. Had the pleasure of seeing her in LA and she sounds equally good in person!
B000002GXJ|5.0|If you like the Eagles, you will love this live version. Hit after Hit coming at you always. just buy it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game to past the time.  Not so hard to play, but can be challenging enough to keep you hooked!
B0056JJ1M8|4.0|I really liked the movie I thought that the makers really inspired people who have been through tough times and this teaches them if you do good then you can get farther in life.
B00CATSONE|2.0|the author wants you to buy it based on the name, and then tries to make a book on &#34;imagination&#34;  Come on, lets get real.  If you don't have anything to say, then best too button one's &#34;imagination&#34; and just rub the dog's back.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|never a disappointment when I pick up a Nicholas Sparks book one of the few writers I can't put down till I reach the back cover.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This review was for a different book. Sorry for the inconvenience - as I have not yet read this book.
B008BF9ZFM|5.0|We found \\"The Fishing Derby\\" to be a fun story with great flow and rhyming that puts a smile on my face while reading and my daughters face as she listens. We have read other books from this author to our daughter at bedtime and she has liked them all. Since Kindergarten our daughter has requested these stories time and time again. We look forward to more ultra creative, and engaging books from the author.
B0044E9LW6|5.0|My only regret of seeing this must-own (a physical copy) of this superbly-packaged live Dio 2-CD title was that Ronnie James had to leave us for this title to get released. I'm sure that I (at one time) had a bootleg cassette of at least one of these fantastic Dio concerts. Disc one is Dio's beloved shindig in 1983 at the UK metal fest of (all) festivals in 1983 of his 'Holy Diver' trek. Just couldn't get enough of \\"Straight Through The Heart\\", Sabbath's \\"Children Of The Sea\\", the awesome \\"Holy Diver\\", a couple Rainbow's best - \\"Stargazer\\", well as \\"Man On A Silver Mountain\\" as well as \\"Starstruck\\" {I wasn't aware that Dio ever played this song on tour}. Then there's disc two - from Dio's memorable 1987 show off the 'Dream Evil' tour delighting our aural sense with the frantic opener title cut from that lp \\"Dream Evil\\", Black Sabbath's ace '80's head-banger \\"Neon Knights\\", \\"Naked In The Rain\\", \\"Rock And Roll Children\\" and his rarely-played (live, anyway) \\"All The Fools Sailed Away\\" and \\"The Last In Line\\". Usually, I say - go ahead with the digital download(s). But not this time - get yourself an - actual old-fashioned physical copy of this essential Dio piece. So highly recommended, it hurts.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is the best thing  it has ever happened. I really enjoy it allot. I have all my family playing .
B000FA5STS|5.0|Caught my attention from the get go and kept it to the end. Couldn't put it down. Sidney was the strongest of women in so many ways.
B00005JO9J|5.0|Finally, one day it was a rainy, &#34;movie&#34; or &#34;tv&#34; show day.  Well, I don't like shows with canned laughter. I don't like to be told when to laugh or boo etc. I do like drama with comedy when you least expect it.  I like shows that have a good storyline and hook you into different characters that you follow each week.<br /><br />The acting is top notch, and you can see as these characters begin getting into their parts. They make you laugh, they make you cry, but during this first season it is mostly laughter.<br /><br />Give the show a few episodes and I can almost guarantee that it will suck you in after only a few episodes!!
B003IMMEKG|5.0|I really can't rate this movie by blu ray standards because I bought this movie with region B viewing by mistake. However the movies itself I like.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book cause it was so funny I love this book the 6 ones the best lol the BEST
B005K17RU0|5.0|As a pilot and someone who travels a lot its great having accurate forecasts. I have 6 places were I follow the daily weather
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I am extremely impressed with the accuracy of this example of app wizardry. We can actually plan our outdoor life around these forecasts! Truly one of the most important apps residing in my Kindle. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Also, thank you Amazon.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|Huey Lewis & The News- gifted musicians and a great singer- I like their music- I like this CD-I Want a new Drug and Oh... It's Hip to be Square.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is probably one of the best apps ever created. u can do anything. I prefer creative mode because you can build anything and u can not stop once you get started. my 9 year old sister said it was a waste of money until she got it, and now she can not take her eyes off it. totally worth it!!!
1401923127|5.0|I loved the book and I love how the author made the science of the make-up of the cell so understandable.  I have affirmed so many of my beliefs and it has opened up my mind to exploring new thoughts.  I highly recommend it.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|This was one of our mystery bookclub books.  I enjoyed it. I would recommend it to others as well.  Thank you.
B004BSFC6Y|2.0|Nice idea and we just dangle it in front of our baby and he plays with it that way. I like the idea but there's no elastic to it at all so he kicks his legs and they go flying off. I do like the Sassy 2 Piece Wrist Rattles Set Amazon sells although colors may vary and we ended up with the pink strawberry and bumble bee (we have a boy so we'd prefer every other one than that strawberry but it's cool).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This product is a game similar to temple run But more fun between the ages of 7 to 40 world have fun with this game.
B00004VW0V|5.0|I can't recommend this enough.  The title cut is, of course, the entire side A.  The richness and texture of the arrangement, the lyrics with the purity of Cat Steven's voice are perfect and evocative.  It's not pop, not jazz, not ballad...it stands as it's own genre.  The rest of the album is very good, too, but Foreigner Suit is a masterpiece.<br /><br />I hadn't heard the album for some time.  When it started, took me back to the 70's like a majik carpet.  So glad to find this on Amazon.
1439153663|4.0|I did not feel that it was as riveting as The Help, but it did provide some historical information about that time period that was quite insightful.
B0035Q4AFC|3.0|Superb acting by Robert Downey Jr., Anthony Hopkins, and Geraldine Chaplin. Having said that, the story is so condensed, there are so many life events merely glossed over, and tons of discrepancies as movies have to mold a story to maintain a flow that keeps the audience engaged as well as fit it all into the allotted time. I enjoyed the film upon viewing its original theatrical release when my knowledge of Chaplin's true biographical story was very limited. Viewing it again recently, I was disappointed and distracted for all of the previously stated reasons.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This game is a blast for me as well as my kids ,it's easy where it needs to be and challenging as well ,great job. guys !!
B004X6PRO6|4.0|An eye opening picture of North Korea.  But a very complicated book. Some of it is truly disturbing.  Reader be advised.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|considered a founding hard rock act, Sabbath does not disappoint on this project.  One can't expect any artist to sound the same after decades.  The foundation,  Sabbath,  and the structure, Ozzy, come together extremely well after so long.<br />It's Sabbath and it's Ozzy, but most importantly,  it's just darn good hard rock.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very intriguing, gets you hooked. This game is unique and challenging, I can't wait for more. The zooming in and out and moving screen around can be a bit tedious but overall love the game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Thank you for who ever invented this it's fun addicting and everyone wants to play it on my kindle fire
B008C20TDG|5.0|I'm still reading through this book, but enjoy the writing style of Melissa Hartwig very much. It's funny and informational. I am getting ready to start my whole30 in two days, so hopefully this will help me with the process.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|Had this and TS2 on VHS for years and finally decided it was time to upgrade to DVD. Great animation, Great musical score by Randy Newman, Great start of animation for Pixar. My favorite 21st birthday gift!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Disney & Pixar Rock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith
0802473156|5.0|Highly recommended for the marrieds or the unmarried. It makes a difference in your life. Grab it before it runs out!
B000I8ES70|2.0|Not quite bad enough to be funny, but close.<br /><br />Pretty much nothing in the story makes sense, no-one behaves in a remotely believable way. (People line up peacefully to get let out of a city, with cannibal zombies behind them? People aren't even that polite on the subway).<br /><br />Atrocious camera work just adds insult to injury. They did manage one rather nice plot surprise that I didn't see coming. About the only good point in the picture.
B004A8ZWVU|5.0|Rarely does a movie capture the same feelings and emotions presented in a well-loved book.  To Kill A Mockingbird did it, and now The Help does it.  After reading the book I was very skeptical that they'd be able to bring the rich, detailed story to life.  I never thought they'd find an actress good enough to embody Aibileen and Skeeter, but they did it.  I was very impressed with the film and all of the actors, and they were very respectful with the story, not veering too far off track.  Jessica Chastain is a standout!
B0030IIYYS|5.0|Have owned this and TS1 on VHS for years and decided it was time to make the upgrade to DVD. I am so glad That I did. Do not watch the third \\"Toy Story\\" because it is just plain awful. Peter Smith
B00821PCJS|1.0|poor plot<br />slow and uninteresting<br />not worth your time<br />waste<br />low point for movies<br />certainly not for anyone with a brain
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely loved the story line, the jokes, the characters, and the over all quality of the movie.  The kid jokes were funny for all ages, and the occassional adult (clean) humor made it extra special for me as an adult.  The Minions stole the whole movie!  They were the best.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|I am not sure how to review this.  Packaging was much like you would expect from a Blue-Ray.  Movie was good and I expected that as well.
B007SPPANM|5.0|I remember when I saw this movie in the theaters with my family the same summer it made it's first theateatrical dabute.  we never got to see the new 3-D rerelease.  I Bought this DVD to give to my mom as a Christmas gift, and we sat down and watched it on Christmas night. As far as I know, she is really enjoying it. Even the musical score by James Horner is Great!!!!!!!! She has the VHS video but has always wanted it on DVD, And since I knew that the previous DVD was out of print, I thought of copying the movie from VHS to DVD but on the other hand, it would probably not work do to copyright restrictions, Oh well. I am glad I bought it for her. Peter Smith  Update for 6/26/2015 James Horner just passed away this passed Monday, 6/22/2015 R.I.P.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is so fun and I love how the game is for all ages. The one thing I didn't like though was the millions of ads that kept popping up. Definitely went way over my expectations.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This he is soooooooooooooooo fun!!!!!! I luv to play it against my Friends when I hook up to face book.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Great book. I love the story as a whole. I wish I had waited to read them when all the books were out I hate the wait.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|It was a very good book, but the language was a bit too fancy and old-timey. I enjoyed it thoroughly in any case. Would give 4 1/2 if it would let me.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love love love it! Can't wait for more levels. Like the fact of multiple rooms too look in for clues!
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect-but was so pleasantly surprised by the fresh yet comfortable Queensryche-iness of this new release!  As other reviewers noted the mix is a bit odd, but in my car, turning the bass DOWN (?!) to -3 makes it sound more even!  Even with that low bass setting and politely lowered volume in traffic it still bothers other drivers!  Scott, Eddie and Michael rock and La Torre brings it!  It seems essentially a musical trip through each album- the good ones!  Bravo!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I love this game I cant seem to stop playing it the puzzles are challenging and engaging. We need more like this one.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Love it...... Battery Pro tells what percent is left on the battery, and how many hours you have left until you have to chardge you Kendle
0785168109|5.0|I bought the other art books in slipcases from The Avengers back to the rest of the Marvel film universe, they're a great collection of art books to have on my shelf. Iron Man 3 continues that tradition...
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love this game, it is both challenging when you dont know somethin and also very fun at the same time! If you are like me you will very much love this game!!!!!! :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All of the 3 books were amazing. But this one is by far the best. It ties loose ends and answers all your remaining questions. You will see almost all the characters turn for the worse. But in the end they change for good. And this book will definitely make you cry. This is the best book and series ever? Real or Not Real?<br />REALLLL!!!!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was the best book ever! I could barely put it down! I highly recommend this book to teens! It was a lot the violent at some parts but it also has a great love story twisted in to the story line! I love the whole story and would ver highly recommend this book!
B00BU18U82|5.0|Rated by my six year old son who LOVES tractors.  Would like to play ever chance he gets.  He is able to figure out the game play just be roaming the farm world.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's just plain fun and exercises the brain a little too. You don't even have to play with a sore loser unless you are one yourself, but in the case of solitaire nobody else is there to care haha!
B000N3ST7A|4.0|She's beeter than I remembered.  Always liked a few of her hits, but after listening to this LP, realized she had much more to offer to the listener.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|Pretty sure this just changed my life. Tough to get through, but it's genius. I may not agree with Ms. Rand's theories, but this novel is fascinating.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|There are plenty of games with similar play, but the graphics and plot make this unique, and the antics of the little people make this hilarious. Well done.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|After reading book 1, I wasn't sure I would read the other two, but glad I  did.  I enjoyed the drama in their life, not just the non stop sex.
B000002KO3|4.0|Their 2nd best LP, in my opinion  (Speaking Tongues is their best). Very glad I purchased this tho.  Diehard T.H. fans would agree.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Very nice, lively team, great screenplay, excellent acting, great music. Drama line is very light and a happy ending is perfectly well adjusted.
B008M34INW|5.0|My wife and I picked this movie out of the blue not knowing what to expect.  Surprisingly funny with action.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Although I really liked this book, I was a bit disappointed with the ending.  I found myself re-reading chapters that I really liked.  Hoping for a continuation.
B000NY17J6|5.0|Wow - her voice was so powerful.  For the money, owning this double volume is much better than just purchasing Vol I alone. Besides, you need &#34;Blue Bayou&#34;!
0374533571|5.0|I haven't seen the movie yet, but if it is as good as the book, I will be very pleased!  Heartfelt, funny and such a creative story!  I tend to lose interest while reading, but not with this book!
0812982622|1.0|Seems the best way to win a literary award these days is to write from the POV of a persecuted minority group. Uncle Tom's Cabin, anyone? Now that Korean is the ethnic flavor of the month: Psy, K-Pop, Korean drama, etc, it was only a matter of time before some \\"noble\\" white man would take it upon his \\"magnanimous shoulders\\" to give a portrayal of poor suffering Korean folk.    Never mind all the Korean and Korean American authors who've written about it. After all, what do *they* know, right? No, it takes Adam Johnson, Mr. Yellow Face Extraordinaire to give \\"true voice\\" to Korean culture, to its very soil.    Yeah, riiiiiight.    This book never felt real. Not one word in it felt like anything other than a white guy's fetishistic scrutiny of a \\"strange and peculiar\\" race.    I am Korean American.  My parents are from Korea.  I've been to Korea.  I grew up steeped in Korean culture.  My parents were originally from the North and lost many relatives during the war.  My Dad still has relatives trapped there.  I got Korea in my blood.  I am also a writer.    With all that, you may assume I've got an axe to grind.    Well, my answer to that is: \\"YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I DO!\\"    Perhaps I should write a book about the poor suffering white-trashy people in the Ozarks? Season the tale with descriptions of strange cultural habits like deep-frying possums and having Oreos for breakfast? While also showing plenty of \\"exotic\\" violence and agony and sexual perversions? And doing it all from a position of condescending arrogance? Yellow Writer in White Face?    Would I then win the Pulitzer Prize???    PS -- I'm not the only member of the growing backlash toward this book.  Check out Catherine Chung's penetrating online article: Yellow Peril and the American Dream.  \\"When I first read The Orphan Master's Son, I thought: I am reading an American cowboy Western. As a setting, it was familiar in its unknowability: it reminded me of the lawless Wild West, filled with bandits, Mexicans, and Indians--enemies so alien that they were only gestures toward themselves, the outlines of our fears.\\"
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I can get really hooked on this game.  Love to play it later in the evening but have to have a time to quit because I can become very involved in the more challenging ones & lose track of time.
0545403359|5.0|Read this.  I liked it better than the movie.  The parts cut out or changed should have been included in the movie.  A good read for anyone who loves horses.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Very cool game!  I like all of the difference choices and combinations available for different situations.  I've gotten hooked!  Very fun.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game. For all ages. better then subway surfer. Better then temple run. I give it 5stars, for creativity. Best game ever
B00DU74U74|1.0|I love movies. I love good movies.<br /><br />This wasn't a good movie.<br /><br />In fact, it was so cheesy, ridiculous, badly (and unimaginatively!) put together, that my husband and I couldn't even sit through the first hour. The host/alien relationship was so poorly done I literally cringed. I don't know what else I expected...I did read The Host as a teenager, and thought it was one of Meyer's better cheesy teen romances, but then again, I was a cheesy teen when I read it, so who knows what I'd think of it now. After all, the Twilight movies (and books) were all laughable. The Host, however, takes the cake. I'd rather make myself sit through the Twilight movies than this. It's such a disappointment to see an actress like Saoirse Ronan represent a movie like this. It certainly didn't do much for her acting, and unfortunately, her talents were unremarkable here and did little for the movie in general. I wish we could get refunds for rentals, and I will never rent a movie on impulse again without checking rotten tomatoes first.
B000E33VWW|5.0|A true tribute to the genius and suffering of Truman Capote.  This film helped  me to understand the reason he never wrote another after &#34;In Cold Blood&#34;.  What a struggle and a shame to lose this beautiful mind.
0780626966|5.0|I loved this collection.  I love scary movies and this one is a classic!  It had all of the parts of the collection that I was missing.  I give it 5 Stars because I love Robert Englund who is a spectacular actor in all he does, I love the blood and gore, I love how Freddy toys and plays with their minds and how the one smart ones stick together for the common goal of defeating the enemy.  I grew up with the Nightmare on Elm Street movies so it brings back memories of me being balled up eyes steadfast and peeled to the television waiting to see how the next victim would try to fight Freddy.  The Nightmare on Elm Street collection is one I would definitely recommend to everyone fascinated by this fear realm of could it be real or couldn't it.  You be the judge.
B009DCOU9S|2.0|When ever i get these type of apps they eventually stop working and i never get yo usr it again
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Awesome. Cute. Easy for kids and fun for adult. Works for phone or tablet great.<br />Thanks Zepto lab for another fab game
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|more fun and better than quell &amp; quell reflect.  able to solve puzzles without going over no. of moves.  quite addictive!
B000CNE164|5.0|I remember her from the early 60's, but then I forgot about her and a friend brought her to mind this year and I ordered a jass and a classic blues album by the Great Ms. Simone....I was not disappointed!
0547884591|5.0|I bought this book after glancing through the companion &#34;4-Hour Body&#34;, thinking that it was basically a recipe book. Imagine my surprise to find a treatise on learning theory that can be applied to any topic. The author's style keeps the reader amused, entertained, and engaged. And yes - there are a lot of recipes, with helpful preparation hints, in addition to advice on the basic tools and spices the novice chef should procure. I would definitely recommend the book!
B008LV8TSU|4.0|Although I enjoyed the beautiful animated feature, I believe the book is able to flesh out the characters better.  Perhaps I'm just an old-school reader at heart.  Anyway, worth the read.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I like that product. Easy to set-up and use! and when you begin to use it, you become addicted, especially in my case to know how I sleep and to be sure I reach my 10,000 steps a day<br />The bad point ? It is small and light, so just take care not to put in the washing machine when taking off your clothes!!
B002VX3RCW|5.0|Lots of different textures and sounds. Keeps my son entertained in the car and my older daughter plays with it too!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I can't say enough good things here. GET ONE. After using mine for a day or so I ordered another for the bedroom TV.<br /><br />Right now there are limited apps but there are MANY more in the works by third parties. I predict this will be a VERY popular product.
B00CHVJ4SO|4.0|I SAW THIS MOVIE SEVERSAL MONTHS! IT'S ABOUT A FAMILY PREHISTORIC FAMILY OF CAVE PEOPLE. THAT NEVER WENT BEYOUND THERE BOUNARDS. THEY HAVE THREE RULES SOMETHING NEW IS BAD. SOMETHING DIFFERENT IS BAD!AND NEVER GO BEYOUND THE CAVE FOR A LONG PEROID OF TIME. BUT THERE OLDEST DAUGHTER IS DIFFERENT. SHE WONDERS ABOUT THE THINGS BEYOUND THE CAVE!

I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU TO MUCH. YOU HAVE TO SEE IT FOR SELVES!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I truly love Phantom of the Opera! The performance was superb and the music is astounding!! Even onstage the story continues to wow so many phans (me included). Ramin, Sierra, and Hadley all did an excellent job of bringing ALW's Phantom of the Opera to life and could not make a better cast! I was sooo excited to receive my copy in the mail. It came a week after purchase and in excellent condition. In all I was very satisfied and do not regret my decision to buy my own copy of the onstage production.
0525958002|5.0|Having hit puberty while Duranmania was in full swing, I thought I knew everything about the Fab Five - I was wrong!  I finished this book in a weekend, it was that hard for me to put down. Looking at the pictures took me back to the days when I had Duran posters on every square inch of my bedroom, even the ceiling!
B000L53D4O|5.0|This was a deal of the day that I got for my granddaughter's 2nd birthday.  Once it was opened, she wouldn't play with anything else.  Now her sister (9 mos. old) is using it to help her stand and walk.  Typical Fisher-Price quality and durability means that it will last for a long time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second of the Hunger Games books is an easy read that captivates you from the beginning.  The ending was a complete surprise to me.  If you enjoyed the Hunger Games, you are going to love Catching Fire.  Easily my favorite of the 3 books.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Very neat and fun game. Lots of things to do and easy to play. I recommend anyone to play this game... GREAT!!!
B003VANOFY|4.0|The second I put on the headset I could tell that it is the most comfortable gaming headset money can buy.  Despite the strange appearance it is amazing.  Once I got it hooked up to my PC (at the time my keyboard was broken so I was stuck on a Mac Book which the headset also works for without surround) I could hear the surround sound in well configured games.  Games that support it don't always properly utilize it.  However the controls aren't placed too well for overall gaming.  While in shooters your right hand usually can't be spared, in most other game types you need your left hand on the keyboard at all times.  If I want to turn down the volume while I'm in a car chase in GTA I have to reach across with my right hand to reach the volume wheel.  In addition the headset has a switch to enable and disable Dolby Surround Sound.  I don't see why this is necessary, especially since it is so close to the power button that I often accidentally turn off the surround sound when turning the headset on or off.  The Micro USB port is recessed to improve cosmetics but this also makes it hard to plug it in.  However I'm not docking a star for that since unlike competing wireless 7.1 headsets it supports use and charge on a single USB port vs. one for charging and one for signal.  The G-keys are virtually useless since they don't work with most VOIP services and that's really what I would imagine them being used for.  Not in-game actions. Overall this is an amazing headset and I would recommend it.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this game - it's really pretty in colors and it does teach you things about the sea and reefs and fish (even sharks - did you know there is a vegetarian shark? - there is! and s/he is BIG but won't hurt the fishies in the sea) - I highly recommend this for children so they can learn about the sea and the creatures that live in the sea!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The final of the Hunger Games series is a good easy read with a lot of twists, I enjoyed the book but Catching Fire was my favorite of the 3.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I love vampire diaries and I was completely satisfied with my purchase. Loved that I got it for so good a price.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I love that the story of Eva and Gideon will continue!  The ending of Entwined With You was disappointing because it ended too abruptly without further conflict to propel it forward.  However, Sylvia Day is such an amazing writer, I know she must have several compelling ideas for plot development.  Perhaps she has introduced too many characters for some of her readers to remember, but she is quite adept at developing them and making them integral in the lives of Eva and Gideon, a feature that only enhances the plot and makes the characters seem more realistic.  The mindblowing, erotic sex between Eva and Gideon provides exquisite vicarious pleasure for Sylvia Day's readers!
B0063M22QO|3.0|I find this a very simple game and would recommend it for the very young or &#34;simple&#34;.  I play it only when I am not able to play any of my other games...waiting for &#34;lives&#34;, &#34;cards&#34;, etc.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Nice game enjoyed the puzzles, could've had better animations, but the graphics are decent. I think some of the characters are very strange, but the story line is okay.
0425263924|1.0|The first book I really liked. The second was so-so. This one though was terrible. Eva honestly has zero backbone and I got sick of their entire relationship mostly being based around sex. If they were angry, they had sex. If they were unhappy, they had sex. If they were having any problems within their relationship, they had sex and somehow it made everything better. And Eva.. sigh. She was very back and forth. One minute she's furious at how Gideon is treating her, the next she is at his feet worshiping him and all is ok again. I was annoyed at how he treated her. So many incidents where he didn't speak to Eva for days, would not explain a thing to her, had his bodyguard take Eva away so he didn't have to deal with her himself.. I mean what grown woman would allow this? It isn't sexy, it's annoying. And dropping your girlfriend/fiance/wife to deal with your ex even though she has her own husband there... Just no. I was always waiting for Eva to finally lose it and give him a piece of her mind, but she didn't. She allowed him to continue treating her like a little rag doll. Do not even get me started on the ending... Such a disappointing trilogy all together and this last book I felt like there was hardly a plot to hold on to and Sylvia relied on the sex scenes to make up for it, but it just didn't work
B009PHQ9OA|5.0|I really enjoy every song on this CD and listen to it all the time. This band doesn't need to be labeled by a specific genre because it is so amazing and I don't really know what it would best fit into. I think it is also very cool that the lead vocalist writes all the songs!
1781162646|5.0|The book was in great condition, arrived in a timely manner, and I enjoyed it very much although, not having read Stephen King in quite a long time, I was surprised by this book...in a good way!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Get repetitive sometimes but other than that it is a great game I really like it although I wish the coins weren't so hard to get and I think things that cost coins should be a lot cheaper
B009C7JS14|5.0|This app has a nice appearance, nice features and it is User friendly.  It would be a nice addition to any mobile device.
B009CCBCU4|4.0|Zoe Saadia sets her story in the ancient Aztec world. It was a refreshing change to read a story from a time and place most authors never venture to. The story surrounds two young men, both are sons of the leaders of their people. Their friendship is unlikely because of who they are, but it becomes stronger as the boys start to grow into men. I loved the main characters and the twists and turns of the plot. I intend to dive into the next book in the series as soon as I can.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The title didn't represent the book to me. It was easy to put down and let lay for a few days. However, it gave you insight into the life of VERY unfortunate souls.<br />I would only recommend this to history lover.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|Interesting tale of a young abused boy who ran away from home to meet other adventures.  It deals with racial prejudice and kindness of people.  I used this as background for a trip to Hannibal, MO where Samuel Clemens lived.  I was able to view the topography differently by visualizing the area when he lived there.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|My grandson was only 4 month old the first time he tried it. He loves it. He had to be taken out of it against his will because he bounced so much he was making his little toes sore.
B0053O89YM|5.0|I could watch these episodes til the cows come home. Aside from having compelling story lines, it is wonderful visually. Not to mention the fashion...
1421550644|5.0|Beautiful packaging. Even more beautiful books. I was actually surprised at how big everything was but you really need to hold this book in your hand to understand how great it looks. Never mind the story itself. That is predictably great and you probably wouldn't be here if you didn't already know that.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I can't even tell you how fun and cute this game is. It's only cute because of the minons! LUV THEM!!!!!!!!!
B00A83075M|5.0|precious movie, that we all love to watch as a family!!! can be a bit scary fo a younger child
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Racketeering for profit is one thing.  Personally, I would like to get my black belt while a political prisoner.  Thank G_d for John Grisham.
0060922583|4.0|Very good read.<br /><br />Everything minus the inanimate object, personal anecdotes and LSD sections were very interesting. Recommend reading for those interested in physics and quantum theory.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|But you're completely bummed when you finish! Wonderful science and history conjecture mixed with fact and woven into a thriller. I am a new fan of Mr Rollins and will be reading more soon!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Another fantastic read that inspires one to push towards goals of their own, which they have struggled to strive towards.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Weather Channel on tv is good and so is this app. It does what it is supposed to do and it deserves a good rating.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me and quite honestly, I may never have read it otherwise. What a tragedy that would have been. The Fault in Our Stars is that book that touches your soul and stays with you until you die and then you die a little easier as you recall the words of Hazel and Augustus, who saw dying as a side effect of what they were made of versus this thing that hovered over their days, waiting to swoop down on them. Five stars is not enough to give this book.
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|Temple Run Oz is the first of the &quot;endless run&quot; apps that I ever tried, and in the beginning, was challenging and fun to play.  The graphics in each of the lands of Oz that the game currently features (more lands are in the works) are really colorful and beautiful, and its exciting to change from place to place as you progress.  The downside to the game is that once you become skilled at running, avoiding danger and collecting coins, there is really no where else to go.  I had hoped that when you earned enough coins to purchase a new character to use as your &quot;runner&quot;, that character would have a new set of powers, or SOMETHING to make changing, say from &quot;Magician Oz&quot; to the &quot;China Girl&quot;, worth your while.  Sadly no (and what a silly mistake it was NOT to provide new powers to new  runners it was!).  Still,  Temple Run Oz is an inexpensive app at .99 (unless you decide to start purchasing coins instead of earning them in the game...they are quite expensive!) and I played it often the first month or so after I bought it.  After that, I lost interest and in all honesty haven't picked it up to play since.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Great fun.easy to learn and play. Nice colours. I liked playing it s lot. Thanks for making another great game.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book is an excellent manual on how to build a better body. While there maybe thousands of ways to skin a cat in terms of exercise programs if your looking to build muscle and loose fat Bigger Leaner Stronger has all the information you need.<br /><br />Michael Matthew's gives a nice brief history about why you can't go by what the major muscle magazines advise and why not to follow the Mr. O pro's. The book is backed by plenty of studies proving many of Michael's points and backing his knowledge of bodybuilding and fitness.<br /><br />I started following only a few of the principles he outlined in this book 3 weeks ago and I have already lost 4 pounds and my strength has gone up every week by at least 10 pounds an exercise consistently. This week I decided to adopt the entire weight regiment outlined in the book and I can't wait to see what kind of positive changes ensue. Excellent no nonsense information about building the body you want!!!!<br /><br />Update, I am in my 5th week of doing the weight routines and eating methods and I have lost 11 pounds to date and my strength has sky rocketed. This book cuts through all the confusion of workout programs out there and gives you what works to build a great physique. If your like most people who don't want to hear the hype and just want to get to a sensible workout and nutrition program that works then this book is for you.<br /><br />Some of the sections that explain exercise and terminology might be a bit basic for people who have experience with exercise but they are great reference sections. Great material and the workout routine is producing great results for me and I am working out in my basement with just free weights. I would probably be doing even better if I went to a gym!
B007PVHMCG|1.0|My son is Minecraft crazy, anything and everything related to it. He also love LEGO - so I thought this was the perfect gift.<br /><br />I know Lego is pricey, but it's an amazing toy, and I don't mind paying for quality and value, but this was ridiculous. The pieces in this set are basically entirely made up of the most simple building blocks and small lights - it's like a BASIC set. there are NO minifigs included, the characters are made from blocks. (now i know this is the point of Minecraft but still).<br /><br />The package is tiny (about the size of a single toilet tissue roll if it were in a box. Again this is simply not worth $50 - maybe $25...
B00E8B1358|3.0|This was an enjoyable movie. It got a bit confusing with all of the masked characters, but it was better acted than I feared it would be!
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I think the next gangster should take place in the 1950s this franchise is gangsta and the new one should be free like the comment you think the next gangster should take place in the 1950s and be free
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|It's a simple game where you're shown the end product and have to come up with the process. The only thing I would change is that it only had 40-some levels. I would want more. I got it as a free app, but if I had paid for it, I would have been disappointed with how quickly I got through it.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Love this movie! It is one of my favorite all time classic as a kid growing up. I had to buy it, and share it with my kids! & They loved it! 😃
1476733953|5.0|Ok, so I read Shift first.  But, then, I WANTED to go back and read Wool.  It was really an excellent book, writing, editing and delivery were all top notch.  Hugh Howey is now a \\"to watch\\" author on my list, as a 15 year veteran of the book store biz, I can generally pick 'em.  This is an author to watch.  I can't wait for Dust to come out!
B00CPTUN5G|3.0|I loved My Little Pony as a kid so it's extra fun to share movies like My Little Pony Equestria Girls with my own daughter. Paige loves the ponies as much as I did and has the added fun of being able to watch them on TV and movies.<br /><br />It's funny the things that kids notice because as soon as the music started for MLP, Reed said \\"what IS this song?\\" The upbeat fun version of the title song got a facelift and is a great way to show that this movie is different than the regular show. It sets the tone for the movie.<br /><br />This movie is a classic tale of good versus evil when Princess Shimmer steals from Princess Twilight. (Who ever heard of a villain being named Princess Shimmer?) When they are turned into humans and attend the same school, they face additional challenges. My kids really got a kick out of seeing their ponies as humans. They were easily identifiable with their trademark colored hair and outfits.<br /><br />The ponies were a bit sassy and sarcastic which I don't really like as a mom. I don't think one character or movie will heavily influence my kids but you never know where they are going to pick up certain phrases or attitudes. They are at the age that they repeat everything to try it out for themselves and gauge my reaction. I also think maybe it was a little old for my four and five year olds as they haven't yet had any of these experiences in school yet and can't really relate.<br /><br />Nonetheless they enjoyed the movie and Paige especially was laughing a lot and understood the humor. While I also enjoyed the movie, as an adult I can discern better than my children what is appropriate so I think I'll put away My Little Pony Equestria Girls for a couple of years until they are older.
B00192KCQ0|1.0|Ordered it because it was supposed to be like old Metallica.  It's not!  They will never be the old metallica. They suck.
1604680547|5.0|This book is what I expected and has (as it says) 501 easy to follow quilting motifs.  I find it very satisfactory.
1594488843|5.0|This book is one that every boss and every employee should read.  Although simple in concept, everyone should accept their role in creating the environment to maximize drive.
B008YRVW0I|4.0|Challenging,it is fun to see how the aquarium begins to develop  as the game progresses. Take a break in playing to observe.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Love these experiments. First one brought a sale of a painting online. The second found many sunset beige cars, I am still working on these experiments.
B004021BWK|5.0|Wonderful for all those outfits that don't match with the normal pink and purple that these usually come in. I love them and my daughter does too.
1470335492|5.0|My first McEwan book, it was a pleasure. Excellently constructed with fine writing. In addition, the presentation by Juliet Stevenson was really exceptional. She made each character come alive and expressed the story so much better than I could have done by just reading it.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Dan Brown delivers again. Another excellent thriller and it is entertaining. If you like the genre or Dan Brown, you will enjoy it.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|It's ok, some good action.  Mindless entertainment, good for a night when you just want to be visually entertained, man mode..
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It charges my Kindle Fire HD quickly.  Also, any other android item.  I'm very pleased with how it works. Thank you.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Enjoyed reading this book.  My father was a Pacific theater combat veteran and this made me appreciate more of what he may have gone through.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Pretty good game, but if I have to walk away from my phone and it goes dark, Jurassic says I have lost the internet and have to quit.  So I hit their quit button and reopen the game again, but it doesn't work very well from then on.  I then have to use my phone buttons to quit and reopen for it to work right.  Happens every single time I walk away, grrrr!  I'm about to quit!
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I use this adapter primarily with a Surface Pro tablet when I need a wired connection.  In the USB 3.0 port, I'm able to achieve the full 1G speeds this adapter offers.  I've also used it with a USB 2.0 laptop and was able to get about 350 on USB 2.  I'm very happy with it, it does what I need it to do.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|James pulls no punch in telling you how he feels and it is enlightening to hear someone tell the truth. You don't need a college degree to be successful nor do you need a house. His own story of his rise and fall several times is honest and straight forward. I think this book should be required reading in schools. We need to think differently in this ever changing world and James is leading the way!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|from 3-40 everyone in the family enjoys this game. it is easy enough for our toddler yet challenging enough for the adults. the boards are also different on every run which is very cool
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|works with YouTube but not Amazon Prime instant vidoes<br />Once again Google disappoints...<br /><br />Setup worked, it never said it would only work with Chrome..<br />Can send YouTube to TV but when I try Amazon Instant Videos, it just shows a black screen on the TV
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My kids and I really had fun playing this game.  We can't wait for more levels!  We enjoy working together to figure them out.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Great App. Just wish that there  where more Free puzzles. I would recommend  this app to any jigsaw puzzle lover. It would be nice  if you could covert your own pictures into puzzles.
B00CH87HF4|1.0|This game is good but when you continue playing it gets boring that is why I don't like this game
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It shares the results of many interesting studies as well as the progress of a variety of programs aimed to help increase a child's chances of future success.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Tight writing and the actors are first class. The tension is palatable and very realistic. A really, really great show
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Can't stop playing it. Every time I play it my daughter says..Really dad?!!.........Yes Really!!!  I have to sometimes go behind her back. :)
B00933JL0A|4.0|My brother liked this game but I did not like it when I got this game it was very good
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Awesome box set.  LOTs of special features and quality of the rip is excellent.  Definitely one of my favorite movie series to date.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to navigate, includes lots of features, generally accurate weather. Updated weather warnings and extended forecasts are a nice bonus. Good weather app!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|lots of fun in these songs some love and some despair but all enjoyable especially ho hey  buy it and enjoy
0670014893|5.0|Great style from an expert storyteller.  Quite knowleggable about modern corporate and governmental cooperation in deceiving the public of clandestine activities.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|All I can say, is it brought tears to my eyes because of the beauty and truth to it all. You'll love this book.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|SO many features, SO worth the $0 price tag! I am finally waking up in the morning! This app gives night owls like me a lot of handy ways to trick themselves into awakening.
B00846REIS|3.0|If what you're looking for is a book like 50 Shades of Grey this is exactly that.  The plot line is 90% the same and the characters are nearly 100% the same.  I enjoyed 50 Shades but after this book I was kind of burned out.  I found myself skipping pages because it because so repetitive.  I don't think I will continue the series...  I will say if I read Bared to You first, I would have felt the same way about 50 Shades of Grey.  They are just too similar to compete.  My advice would be to read one or the other, you don't need to read both.
B001NHNG64|5.0|The Jack Reacher series has not failed to keep me entertained.  I usually order the next in the series just as soon as I finish the previous.  Still having a hard time visualizing Tom Curse as 6'5&#34; Jack Reacher, but that's a story for another day.
B003719G40|5.0|This book was very insightfull and helpful in trying to figure out were things went wrong.  Mr Chapman also has wonderful suggestions on how to repair the relationship. Well worth the time to read!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This is a great game i love it....still trying to figure out how to play my friends but over all great game
6304712499|4.0|I sent this to my son in the mid west as a gift , He Likes it alot. I personally have never seen this movie but would like to, since my son likes it i might buy one for myself.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I feel that this game is fun and very affordable for all ages this game was wonderful now all my friends play it.
0756655307|5.0|I really enjoyed this Marvel  Encyclopedia because it provided information on the Marvel Characters.  I also enjoyed allowing my students time to read through the book about their favorite character.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I've had this bad boy for about 2-3 months now. It's running great and the buttons still feel like new. I switch the sensitivity when I switch from playing first person shooter game to when I need to type a document. Really useful for those who prefer different sensitivities without going to mouse options.<br /><br />Also the numerous buttons is ideal for gaming and it definitely helps me preform better on some games that require a fast reaction.
B00947N6D8|5.0|my grand children and the parents just love it! From what they said about it, i would like to see it myself
B008R3EYZ4|5.0|Great concert.  I would recmmend it to anyone.  Been a fan of Richie Blackmore since his Deep Purple days, great theme.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|[[ASIN:B00CV8ILAK Subway Surfers]]Subway surfed is SO much better than temple run. This game is a great substitute for people like me who never liked temple run. It's very cartoonish- which makes it great for young children. That's all I have to say. I want to get back to playing Subway Suffers.

B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I remember when I bought Modern Combat 3, and just like that amazing game, Modern Combat 4 continues to push the boundaries of smartphones and tablets. If you have not yet purchases this amazing mobile FPS, wait for Modern Combat 5, due around August-September. It's just like Call of Duty on the go. Also, for Halo enthusiasts, try N.O.V.A. 3.

0984999302|5.0|I've been a fan of these guys since Blank's Four Steps to the Epiphany. This book rocks! As an entrepreneur, as a business professor in an MBA program and as an educational entrepreneur I cannot recommend this book more highly. Before you invest your money (and other people's money) READ THIS, DIGEST THIS, EMBED IT in you DNA. Failure to do so will be painful, humiliating and EXPENSIVE.

B00BD6KPFU|5.0|I have watched Suits since it initially aired, great show with even greater cast.  I ordered season 2 to get updated for season 3 only to find that an entire episode is missing.  The one where Rachel gets news that she did't get accepted and Lewis went to bat for her. It also is the beginning of the merger.  I was really disappointed that this episode was left out, it would give some background for this season.  This isn't the shows fault of course but those thinking of purchasing this set should know of the missing info.
B000I3UAJ0|2.0|Yes, I'm a new(er) Trekkie. I've seen all of The Original Series, the first six movies, and then the Abrams movies (although the latter two don't really count for this review). I was hesitant to watch this movie because I heard it was tediously slow...<br /><br />... Quite correct, I'm afraid.<br /><br />The movie itself does not have much action. Yes, Trek's wonder was that it did not have to have constant space battles, it didn't have to be constant action and yet, people still loved it. But, personally, I think The Motion Picture lacks even the amount of action that would draw people in. The 'action' that it does have is incredibly slow.<br /><br />The second part of what I believe makes Star Trek wonderful is the character relationships. This is lacking in this movie as well. Kirk, McCoy, and Spock were all in different parts of the galaxy due to their 'retirement'. When they finally reunite, there is little to no playful banter as was expected from TOS. Even Spock and McCoy aren't at each other's throats, in their comical way, as they usually were. There's one really nice friendship scene between Spock and Jim towards the end of the movie, but otherwise, it's a bit dull.<br /><br />Third, there seemed to be some things that they didn't explain well. For instance, Spock undergoing the purse of emotion on Vulcan. He joins Jim and McCoy in his quest to figure what is pulling him back towards space, but, even at the end of the movie, all Spock comments is that his mission is complete. It ties the story together, but it's weak.<br /><br />Other than that, the effects are... lacking. Understandably, the effects aren't going to be top notch compared to today. There's literally about a ten minute span of Scotty and Jim flying via shuttlecraft to the Enterprise. Presumably if you've watched or plan to watch the movie, you know the issue they had with special effects, but it does really make it slow.<br /><br />Out of the six Kirk movies, this is my least favourite. While I think this would have been wonderful for a television episode- fifty minutes- it was far too drawn out for a movie.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|...way too much downloading - like megaload downloading. After downloading the app, then comes a big download of graphics. After downloading graphics comes yet another megaload downloading session. I've yet to actually play it (though it looks like it'll be fun). I'm hoping 4,000 can't be wrong.

B005BLP0C6|3.0|This album is nowhere near their last 2 albums 'Room Service' and 'Have A Nice Day' which are both in my top 5 albums of all time, but thats asking quite a bit.  I was hoping at least for 3 or 4 really good gems with several solid support songs. Well for me anyway, there are a lot of solid songs, but no real gems such as 'Crush on You', 'Real Sugar', 'Starz', Waiting for the rain' etc..<br />perhaps easier to say there are some good B and B+ material but no A or even A-.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Like countless other women out there, I really enjoyed this book. I thought the story line was interesting, yet a bit unrealistic. The main character, Ana, can be a but annoying in that the author writes the book from her POV, her subconscious' POV, and her inner goddess' POV (it's like 3 personalities rolled in 1). If you can get past all that, it's an easy and fast read.
B0097UO87U|2.0|I've been waiting so long for Jeff Lynne's new album, but I must say I'm  pretty disappointed in it, and above all, to find out its mostly a cover album.  I absolutely love the first song 'she' which took Elvis Costello's song and added lots of Jeff's infamous harmonies to, but thats about it for me on this album.  Kind of the same way I felt about 'Armchair theater'.  I was hoping it would be a lot more like 'Zoom', his last album which I love very much that is stamped with the 'Electric Light Orchestra' title though its very much a solo album.
B00AVXVQGI|5.0|This is one of Austen's more serious novels. Unlike P&P and Emma (which fall on the chick lit/romcom side), this novel is less comedy and more thought provoking.<br /><br />The heroine is older (27) and there's no sought after eligible Mr Darcy here to save her or her sisters from a Mr Wickham type. In this novel, the heroine, Anne Elliot was in love with a man considered unworthy of her affections and thus rejected when she was only 19. However, now a self-made man, Captain Wentworth has returned to the scene and we explore a woman's position in society, her love for a man and the difficulties of relationships and all that it entails.<br /><br />Synopsis:<br />Twenty-seven-year old Anne Elliot is Austen's most adult heroine. Eight years before the story proper begins, she is happily betrothed to a naval officer, Frederick Wentworth, but she precipitously breaks off the engagement when persuaded by her friend Lady Russell that such a match is unworthy. The breakup produces in Anne a deep and long-lasting regret. When later Wentworth returns from sea a rich and successful captain, he finds Anne's family on the brink of financial ruin and his own sister a tenant in Kellynch Hall, the Elliot estate. All the tension of the novel revolves around one question: Will Anne and Wentworth be reunited in their love?<br /><br />Jane Austen once compared her writing to painting on a little bit of ivory, 2 inches square. Readers of Persuasion will discover that neither her skill for delicate, ironic observations on social custom, love, and marriage nor her ability to apply a sharp focus lens to English manners and morals has deserted her in her final finished work
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|Short and Sweet:<br /><br />The idea is great. As implemented, however, the Nemo's Reef is designed solely to separate you from as much hard cash as possible.  This isn't a game.  It is a shopping mall. No skill is involved. The tasks you are assigned consist of buying items and/or feeding them.  \\"Game play\\" consists of buying, planting, and harvesting (by clicking endlessly and mindlessly on what you have planted to acquire what you need to buy and then feed your purchases) or by buying what you need with real money.  I cannot overemphasize this: you do not advance in the game by demonstrating a skill or solving a puzzle.  You advance by buying, spending, endless tapping, and gambling. My biggest regret is that it has taken me so long to realize this is a mindless, and I do mean mindless, exercise created solely to produce profits for Disney.<br /><br />Extended:<br /><br />I got Nemo's Reef (for free) for my Kindle Fire HD out of simple curiosity.  At first I was thrilled. It appeared to be designed to teach one how to build and maintain a healthy reef, something I know nothing about. A great idea.  Too bad that isn't its objective.<br /><br />The reef has three main \\"currencies\\": sand dollars (to buy plants, coral, ornamentals), pearls (to buy certain more important plants, corals, ornamentals), and algae (to feed plants and fish). Plants produce varying amounts of sand dollars (SD) and corals produce varying amounts of algae. Only rare fish produce pearls, on extended time schedules (the shortest is, I think, 1 pearl in 48 hours) although the game will also occasionally award pearls.  The currencies are not interchangeable.  Algae only feed plants and fish. SDs buy some items; pearls buy others.  One can exchange pearls (a rare commodity) for SDs (a plentiful commodity) at a rate that would put loan sharks to shame.  Disney charges a small fortune for SDs and algae, relative to the ease of acquiring them by tapping, but far, far less for pearls, again, relativeto the difficulty of getting them in other ways. $2 will buy 85 pearls, impossible to accumulate in any other way as far as I can tell, or 400 algae (very easy to collect, depending on the size and makeup of your reef, in a few minutes) or 1600 SDs (which, again, depending on the size and makeup of your reef, may take 10-15 minutes to collect.) Finally, and this is very important, while plants and corals produce SDs and algae on specified schedules, you must physically (by tapping on the plant) harvest them to add them to your inventory.  So, for example, Fan Coral produces 2 algae every 30 seconds.  If you need 250 algae for a task, that means 125 taps.  Great for developing RSS.<br /><br />The goal of the game is to attract rare fish, advance from one level to another, and expand the reef by gathering points in a variety of ways. You can't, however, simply buy rare fish.  You must buy and grow rare plants.  But you can't just buy rare plants. No.  To get a rare plant, you must plant a Mystery Seed  (currently for me that's 1200SD, 600 algae), an Enigmatic Mystery Seed (10,000SD, 6000 algae), or an Extraordinary Mystery Seed (10 pearls, 30 algae).  BUT, the cost of the seeds increases as you advance in the game.  Further, Mystery Seeds rarely produce Rare Plants.  Indeed, out of the dozen or so I've bought and planted, all have produced plants I could have bought & fed for far less than the cost of the seeds.  (I could have \\"bought\\" at least a couple for 10 SDs). The Enigmatic Mystery Seed is, according to Disney, more likely to produce a rare plant but still no guarantee.  That's right: you can pay 10,000SD and 6,000 algae (by spending hours and hours tapping the most productive plants and corals to get the SD and algae or by buying what you need with real money) and still not be guaranteed a Rare Plant.  The Extraordinary Mystery Seed will produce a Rare Plant BUT, you knew this was coming, right: all of these, even if they do produce a Rare Plant, may produce one you already have and that does you absolutely no good at all.  That's right: one Rare Plant per Rare Fish. A second rare plant of the same kind you already own does you absolutely no good. Money down the drain. (I spent a virtual fortune on two Enigmatic Seeds and two Extraordinary Seeds.  From the 4, I got one ordinary plant, two duplicates of existing rare plants - and I had only 4 to start - and one new rare plant. Some have suggested that one's chances of getting a single Rare Plant from the ordinary Mystery Seeds increases if one plants ten at a time: 12,000SD, 6000 algae).<br /><br />Note: about half the rare fish in the game need only a few hundred algae to produce a pearl. The other half? In the thousands.  There is one rare fish that needs 60K algae every 24 hours - if you want it to produce a single pearl. Indeed, I added up the algae needed for all the rare fish (thanks to a spreadsheet I found) and it amounts to something like 120,000 algae/day. Maybe it is possible to build a reef that produces this much algae per day and doesn't require you to spend every second of your life tapping, but I can't see how ... or why you would do it since you can buy, with real money, many more pearls than those fish will produce in anything less than a lifetime.<br /><br />The game, furthermore, gives you tasks to complete for which you get points, algae and/or sand dollars.  Some of the tasks have time limits.  One task I was assigned could not be completed in the time allotted unless I spent a lot of pearls to speed up the growth of the required plants.  And what would I get in return? Some SDs, algae and points I could reap myself in a matter of minutes.  Another required feeding a number of rare fish within a specified time period.  (The only way to accomplish this task when I got it would have involved \\"spending\\" over 9000 algae - for relatively little return.)  Other tasks seem to carry over from day to day so you can take your time completing them.  But with these, too, the awards often pale in comparison to the costs.<br /><br />Treasure chests are, apparently, a recent addition.  But they are not really treasure chests.  They are slot machines. Each chest that appears can be opened with either SDs (mine have required from 2K+ to 4K+ dollars and the cost seems to increase as you advance in the game) or pearls (so far, the demand has always been for 6 pearls).  But what do you get in return? Well, if you are lucky, more than you paid (either in SDs or algae).  If you are not, perhaps a lot less.  I got several hundred algae for a couple thousand SD: algae I could have harvested in minutes - in far less time than required to replenish the spent SDs.  I read in one forum that somebody got a similarly small amount of SDs or algae for the 6 pearls.  A few chests are free. You usually get only a few hundred algae or SDs but at least you don't lose money.<br /><br />Occasionally, the game will inform you that a particular kind of fish likes a particular environment.  To find out what it needs, all you have to do is pay for hints - with pearls.  And what will those hints consist of? Well, you will learn what you need to buy, natch, to create the appropriate environment.<br /><br />There is no undo button in the Nursery (where you \\"buy\\" plants, corals, ornamentals).  The difference in touch between sliding along the options in each store category and the touch required to buy an item is not very great.  I accidentally spent 19 pearls (hard won) on a plant I would never, ever have purchased unless required to at some point in the game.  You can't just not feed it. And although there is an option to sell back an item, I think the offer was around 400SD, hardly a fair exchange.<br /><br />Finally, there is no way to simply look at your reef, to enjoy what you have designed, to see all the fish that have been attracted.  That's because all those plants and corals you have planted to produce SDs and algae have huge pointers over them announcing that they are ready to be harvested.  Smart and frugal gamers will plant lots of Yellow Table Plants (which produce SDs every 30 seconds)  and Purple Fan Coral (which produce algae every 30 seconds) so the reef will be flooded with those \\"harvest me signs\\".  I have no idea how prevalent either of these are in a real reef.  Indeed, I have no faith now in any of the suggestions that the game makes especially since, the further I get into the game, the more expensive (in SDs,algae, and pearls) the recommended actions are.<br /><br />You never learn what a real reef looks like. If you visit the reefs of those who have made them publicly visible, you will see that most have been laid out to produce as many SDs and algae as possible by creating groups that make tapping somewhat less onerous. I kind of doubt that this is how real reefs develop.<br /><br />Oh, lastly, there appears to be a problem with the game on the Kindle Fire HD. According to some accounts I've read, at some level it becomes completely unplayable.  I've reached level 20 and it has crashed repeatedly on mine (32GB) the past week or so and, almost every time, I've lost 2 pearls.  It runs through the battery at an enormous rate, and I think the crashes tend to occur when the battery power gets under 80%.  (Because all the landscape games, as far as I can tell, on the Fire HD orient only to the bottom where the USB connectors are, it is pretty much impossible to comfortably play any game while recharging. An Amazon, not a Disney, problem.)<br /><br />On the positive side, this is a wonderful teaching tool about smart shopping.  If your children insist on the game, join them. Ask them, after they've played a while, to look at how much a living plant or coral produces relative to the cost, to evaluate the cost, in hard cash, of SDs or algae or pearls relative to the ease or difficulty of acquiring them in the game (20 real dollars will buy you 22,000SD or 1200 pearls).  When they are given a task tocomplete, ask them to look at how much they will earn relative to the effort and inventory required to complete the task.  Allow them to waste SDs or pearls on a treasure chest that produces almost nothing in return.<br /><br />OK, I didn't buy the game and I haven't spent any real money on it.  So, I shouldn't complain, right?  Disney wants to make money; players are free to feed the company's profits or not.<br /><br />I do have a right, I think, to be disappointed.  A game of this kind has so much educational promise. It is so easy to think of all the ways that this game could have been designed to teach players about an important ocean environment, to build something beautiful to look at. Maybe, someday, some company with other priorities will build such a game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is part 1 of Suzanne Collins' series. Loved the action, suspense, and youthful romance in this young adult book.
B00899D2MM|2.0|I'm a huge Roxette fan but much like tourism, I felt that this album was rushed and as they were doing it while on tour in various hotels, perhaps during their spare time, they didn't put as much effort into it, perhaps because they were focussing to much on their tour. They do much better on albums where they devote 100% of their time for.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|It seems like most games on Android are repeats of each other, so I tend to lose interest in most of them quickly.<br />I installed Slydris on my phone, and proceeded to lose an hour of my day to it.<br />I am a huge Tetris fiend, and this game is an interesting and deceptively simple twist on the concept. Rather than being 2-D shapes, all blocks are single-height and from one to four blocks wide. The objective is to use these blocks to form solid lines which will then vanish from the play field, just like Tetris.<br /><br />Unlike Tetris, though, blocks can only be slid horizontally, where they will fall down if there is sufficient open space below them.<br />Also unlike Tetris, new blocks only fall when you make a sliding move (though they descend instantly when they do). Bonus points are awarded for accomplishing certain things in the game; there are also hindrances and beneficial blocks that you will encounter.<br /><br />I found Slydris to be a refreshing and addictive take on the block-clearing genre, with hints of Bejeweled in the play as well. Permissions are minimally invasive and the app doesn't appear to contain any ad networks, unlike some other recent FAotD's.<br /><br />Essentially the only thing that kept me from awarding this game 5 stars is the fact that in my hour or so of play, my battery plummeted from ~85% to around 14%. This game is absolutely worth downloading, but make certain you have a charger handy for while you are playing it.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This game was fun and entertaining. It was a bit wordy but a good story and lots of different types of games.  It was challenging and offers hints when you get stuck. Overall I enjoyed it.

B009GEEMLY|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  I've been a long time fan of the Incredible Hulk, and I love how they portrayed him in this movie. The only complaint I have is they missed a great opportunity for a real hulk moment when he is faced with all those hovering enemy spacecraft near the end, he should have done a mighty clap,and blown them all away like dandelion seeds from the force of the clap like the comic book Hulk.  I thought they did a magnificent job on the other characters as well. I hope the next one is as good or better in 2015.
B00C7O8TSM|4.0|The main producer listed in the credits is Mike Love, then others including Brian Wilson. It's great watching the group sing, though at the end of the tour, Mike fires Brian, David, Al, Jeff and the rest of the terrific band taking his jukebox touring group out to mixed reviews. Also, this disc is not a full concert recording as it has been edited down to a shorter length. If one were to look up the playlist of the concert dates you will see that several of the songs made famous by The Beach Boys have been cut. It is apparent that Mike Love's voice has been strained and over used and is very weak. Brian, Al, David and the rest of the group sound very good.<br /><br />Disappointed int the final product. It would have been nice if all of the songs from the playlist had been recorded; the fans deserve better. Can't wait to see Brian, Al and David backed by Brian's band touring with Jeff Beck.

B00CATSONE|4.0|Tesla certainly deserves more exposure and praise.<br /><br />While the book does look at him, it is in the context of trying to link him to many great men who early on did not show the great promise that they in fact possessed.

0525478817|4.0|Some bits before I starts my review:  1. I do not, as a rule, read YA books.  They usually don't appeal to me.  2.  I read this because I religiously watch John Green and Hank Green's YouTube stuff religiously.<br /><br />TFiOS is about a teenager named Hazel who has a friend (pretentiously) named Augustus who becomes her boyfriend.  Through Hazel Gus becomes obsessed with an awful sounding book called An Imperial Affliction and it's reclusive author (who sounds like the love child of John Green and J.D. Salinger, but who I think is a weird stand in for God and Cancer).<br /><br />I have a couple issues with this book:<br /><br />It's a little pretentious.  His prose becomes a little too much once in a while.  I don't think *most* kids speak like this, or rather, they don't choose the words Green chose.  Hazel and Gus seem smart, almost too smart.<br /><br />I disliked the ending, though I knew from the start what the ending would be.<br /><br />These are really small complaints.<br /><br />All in all, worth the read.<br /><br />I'd love it if he wrote stuff for adults.  I think he'd be very good at it.

B002VPE1WK|2.0|I wanted to find a small bag that would protect a few lenses while I travel.  This also had a tripod holder and looked to be the best thing ever.  The only problem is this stops working for you if you buy a professional camera or lenes... I shoot canon, and you could probably switch from the T3i or similar model to a 5D, but it would never fit the 1D... and regardless of body, if you shoot an L series lense, it wont fit within the space provided in this pack.  I have a 16-35 (2.8) and 24-70 (2.8) (not the largest lenses) and they do not fit. Great for beginners as it will hold your light tripod as well (not my manfrotto), but if you buy quality gear, this wont work.

Best FAOTD I have seen in a while.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game to exercise your brain.  I like how I can close it out and come back to it later too.
B00CMYRSQG|5.0|I've listened to August Burns Red since &#34;Thrill Seeker&#34; hit the scene in 2005 and have been an avid follower since then.  I've seen them many times and always leave satisfied.  There is always a good chance you'll be able to meet some, if not all, of the bandmembers and they are extremely polite and considerate to their fans.<br /><br />The new album &#34;Rescue & Restore&#34; is incredible and I would say, much better than their last two albums &#34;Leveler&#34; & &#34;Constellations&#34;.  There are elements of both albums in this new one, but done much better.  You can tell that this album was better thought out and organized.<br /><br />I will say the one thing I miss and was hoping for on &#34;R&R&#34; are the instrumental follow-up and epic closing song.  &#34;Thrill Seekers&#34; and &#34;Messengers&#34; (probably my favorite ABR album) both had an incredible instrumental that lead into the closing song on both albums (Seventh Trumpet & Redemption respectively).<br /><br />Overall - an &#34;R&R&#34; is one of the best ABR albums to-date and should be picked up by any ABR fan or fan of the metal-core genre.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|yes this game is very fun and very very addicting. my 3 year old cousin loves it. whatever you do DO NOT UPDATE!!! I updated this game and now it wont work!! I tried to uninstall and reinstall and now it wont work at all!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great thinking game reminds me of the old mist games. Great for challenging yourself and keeping your mind sharp. Very fun to play.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|It is easy to use  you can set the color of the paper i love it it is cool i reccomend
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|Too many drugs! It has the potential for getting someone hooked or re-entering the drug game because of the story line and the assess ability to drugs…horrible!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|It's not that much help.Waste of time ! I can't find any level that I've had a problem with,it's terrible!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This a great FREE game!  The graphics are super clear and the game is challenging and fun! My only complaint is that it's take a while to level up and there are few instructions.
B000FBFMFW|5.0|The continuing story of FitzChivalry Farseer.  Beautifully written.  Engaging characters.  Interesting setting.  I truly love this series.  I have read a lot of fantasy fiction and put this very close to the top of the list (GRRM is right up there too, but RH is not quite as dark and ugly.  Dark and ugly has its place...don't get me wrong.)<br /><br />Robin Hobb has an amazing way with complex emotions and internal struggles.  I'm sure there are plenty of spoilers already written, so I won't rehash the plot.  Do yourself a favor and buy this series.  The first three (Assassin's Apprentice series) are gold.  Her Liveship Trader stuff is good too.  I wish I could erase my memory and enjoy them all over again for the very first time.<br /><br />One of the few books to ever make me cry, and that's saying something.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Just the right size to fit about anywhere. Thought I'd just be putting it in my carry bag, but find I'm using it for more knifes then just a pocket knife. If the blade isn't too dull, it only takes a few passes to bring it up to speed again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super fun and entertaining.  Cross between Temple Tun and that subway game, only it has Minions.  Minions make all the difference in the world, plus it's age specific to make it easy for the little guy's and gal's.  Most definitely a must have.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is so educational but fun at the same time. I love that the game takes you all over the world.  I would really like it if the creators would give more time to redeem the limited time characters and hover boards.
B00DRYWJ6Y|5.0|This quartet is magic. I especially like the interplay of Gary's vibes with Julian Lage's guitar on \\"Jane Fonda Called Again.\\"
B00BM1AJIO|2.0|I can't get the game to play. Won't ever finish downloading. I have excellent internet access so I know that's not prob. I'd love to be able to play the game that I have purchased.
193700788X|1.0|It's the worst of the series, and I really liked the rest of them. It was a waste of time, effort, money, and paper.  Lots of ink to fill up the paper.  It was very apparent to me that the character was dead and buried before the book was written. If you must read it, borrow it.  But frankly, if I'd have known how bad this was, I wouldn't have bought it, and I certainly wouldn't recommend being on a waitlist to read it.  Don't think you will have any action, mystery, suspense, or fun.  There's no figuring anything out.  It looks like a book, but I think it is really a casket that carries a dead Sookie character inside.  Spoiler alert:  $15 bucks to find out she ends up with the dog.
B00271DNP4|3.0|I love Harry Potter and reading the books. But when I got this movie it didn't exactly tell the whole story right. Also at one point I thought they added a new part to it, so overall it was okay.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Despite all its flaws, and despite it's young adult genre, I love the ending. The twist was not in the plot, but in the writing. The ending was so emotional and, ironically, filled with so many adult themes. It was lovely.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Absolutely perfect pacing.  Where early on you get some subtle nods about what was to come, and gradually more and more.  Never once was I not pitching things together and anxious to continue reading to see what happened next that would completely change what I was thinking.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Each level is more challenging than the last.  Makes you use your brain.  Comment can not wait for more levels to be released.
B000F8O35U|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies as a child and now my kids get to enjoy the same movie.
B001P9EQH8|1.0|Didn't really notice a difference in my good headphones only in my cheap headphones so don't buy for good headphones
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is by far much better than others of its kind. It has fun levels and good challenges - achievable but difficult/challenging. And it's cute. What more could you ask for? ;-)
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Just unreal from start to finish . Must read. On edge the whole story . Keeps you guessing till the very end.
0783225725|5.0|Really like Clint Eastwood movies. Was glad that I got to add this one to my collection. Just wish they came in blue ray
6302787068|3.0|I always loved this movie as a kid growing up so was stoked to buy it for my kids.  Yea!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Cute game. No problems yet. I usually try to stay away from the gangs that require you to come back to in real time but I have enjoyed this one.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I liked how developed the male characters were in the book, but I didn't particularly like how under developed the female characters were.<br /><br />Overall, it was an interesting story about ethical and moral values (and when they truly apply).
B000F8O35U|4.0|I always loved this movie as a kid growing up so was stoked to buy it for my kids.  Yea!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I slept for ninety years. Only problem was that everyone I loved grew old and died. Plus I grew a really long, grey beard. But this thing will put you to sleep, for real.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I loved this game until the update on the 3rd. Now it wont load so I didnt have any choice but to delete. So sad, it was a great game up till that point!!!
0375869026|5.0|I know the feelings I am one of these people named,\\" August\\". My son is going into seventh grade and is required summer reading. A great choice!
B00DJUPLY8|3.0|Luckily, it seems to play all the types of files I have, which is better than the Amazon Player that came with my Kindle Fire. Unfortunately, it doesn't always play them well. It also shuts off after a few minutes if you are not constantly attending to it, and it doesn't play &quot;in the background&quot; while you're using other apps like the Amazon Player does. My other gripe is that you can't create playlists with it, or at least I haven't figured out how to and there are no directions to explain how to.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|This was a decent movie.  Not quite the same high-testosterone action of the originals, but pretty good, none the less.  I really liked Jai Courtney.  A great big, beefy stud of a man, he added a lot to the story (wouldn't have minded seeing him wearing a lot less, but that's just me).  I don't think the villains were quite as ruthless as previous ones.<br /><br />I could see Jai taking over the role that Bruce started.  He has a certain tough guy attitude and presence that will serve him well.  And he has plenty of experience (I didn't recognize him from his stint in Spartacus).
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I really enjoyed this book of interwoven stories. I loved, loved Kite Runner and Thousand Splendid Suns an so looked forward to this novel, I was not disappointed.
B0034G4OYA|4.0|The story line is interesting and funny. The acting is great and the animation is outstanding. I enjoyed this movie and recommend it for adults and kits.
B005K17RU0|3.0|It is not as complete as the internet version. I like to view the weather maps to observe the location of frontal systems but the feature is not available on this app.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I think this app is cool because you get an experience to see and make things  in the game! It's great for children. I recommend this app
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|IT Admins, Project Managers, or any IT Professional may feel like their reading about chapters of their life. Easy-read and entertaining book. Felt I could relate to the characters and the story-line.
1604680547|5.0|This book is full of great motifs for hand or machine quilting.  Very easy to use and duplicate the designs.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|My children all live away from us and its a great yo keep in touch with children and grand children
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|The series was great...<br />You have to watch all the seasons to know what is going on.<br />If you like action, drama, comedy you look this series
B0068FYZ3Y|5.0|For the price, you can't beat DVD, Blu-Ray, and a digital copy!  Downloaded the digital copy right into iTunes.  If you love this movie, this is a great buy.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|This movie was nice and funny, good entertainment. I was worth watching, I would recommend it to anyone that wanted a good movie for the night.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I replaced the weather channel app with AccuWeather.  Right away I was distracted by the bottom screen movement with advertisements.  It keeps closing and sometimes it takes awhile to get to the city I want.  I liked the weather channel better but when they changed formats, that didn't work properly also.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|Got this for my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and I like it. It gives you the full site and all of the options that go with it as far as I can tell. So far I haven't run into any problems.
0425267695|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. Simply amazing and I cannot wait for the next. The next one cannot come soon enough.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love this game helps me when I need to relax<br />easy to learn but gets harder as I get better at it
6305882592|5.0|This movie is a timeless classic about loving life and each other. I very rarely watch a movie more than once, and yet this one I've seen a dozen times and never get tired of its encouraging message to seek out joy. Maude shows us all how to LIVE!
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|I love this game it is so fun to play! Each level gets more difficult. It took me a long time to get through some levels. But, Still really addicting and fun to play. But, I would suggest playing the first cut the rope first.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Just hoping that this picks up a little in the next book - the tricks are getting a bit old. Still, entertaining, which is the point. A little more graphic and violent than needed - bring back the politics!
B004F1F32A|4.0|I really liked this action film because it was not over done with gore or pyrotechnics. There was an actual story line and you could follow the emotions of the main character easily.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game brings out my inner nerd. Since I like star wars, this game is even better. If you don't like star wars, then why are you looking at this? Anyways, I would recommend it to every nerd, like me.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|Too bad it was cancelled. Another good series that I liked was also cancelled. That was Farscape. Wonder why they decide to do things like that.
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was very funny, as from what you would expect from these two. If you like Hot Fuzz or their other works you will like this one (this film was less graphic -bloody- than some of their other works).
B001F6ZIXC|4.0|The first couple of episodes are kind of boring and I did not like it. But once you get to the third or fourth episode, you will be hooked. You have to watch the show in order, or you will not fully understand the plot.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I like the product, the way it works, resume download feature is just awesome! However, the ui is not so nice, it lacks HD touch and the icon is just bad;)
0007466064|5.0|I'm both happy and disappointed that the author decided to break up this story into more books. I wonder if it's because its an HBO series, so he is trying to make it extend as long as possible. (this would be extremely unecessary as HBO can always draw out the story themselves, as they have done with book two). I'm just worried that this will go on and on without much progress being made in the storyline. Right now it feels as if the story is stalling.
B0012QTT4O|5.0|I was hooked on this show after the first episode. It is has a perfect amount of humor and action. It is about a high school science teacher partnering up with a formal student to make meth. It may sound twisted, but it is a really good show. The only thing is, I would not recommend it for kids under 16 because of the show's theme.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Love this book. Has all of the physiology information along with diet and reasons why we should eat this way. Makes it easy to understand.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A Blast! Great fun. Love the new update. Can't wait for more new content, hope it comes out really soon.
B001PO53IO|4.0|If I let him he will sit there all day and night watching the whole season in one long marathon!
B0078X2LKY|5.0|I remember my parents reading this book to me many years ago. Now, I'm reading it to my son and he loves it as much as I did when I was young. A true classic for all Sesame Street fans!
B0055OK2T0|5.0|Loved Loved Loved this movie!!!  A very deep story if you can understand, if you are aware of all that is out there... if you've had intuitions and events you cannot explain.  The truth is what you feel.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER BUT THE THING IS AFTER A MONTH  I COULDN't play I hope they fix it so I can love this game again
0812932293|5.0|If your looking for an action packed book with stories that will blow your mind away, you MUST read this book! Richard Branson is honestly living one helluvalife! If your wondering how a billionaire lives then read this book! He is probably one of the most humble, successful people on this planet we call EARTH!
B001HN6922|5.0|my 3 yr old loves this movie so much this is his second copy since he watches it so much it makes marks  on the CD. thanks so much
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft I s one of the best games in the world. But I think that there should be an easier way to create a portal,I also think there should more updates.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I luv dis game because it is so cute. Me, my dad, my brother, my mom, and my dad's girlfriend are so addicted to it. (Btw play Moviestarplanet it's fun, I'm mustache &lt;3 Lily).
B005LAII1C|4.0|Didn't know it wouldn't let me play the unrated version. Other than that the movie was good. Watched it in theater and loved it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This a great escape and fun to play I enjoy taking a break from reality and escaping with this app
0375812024|5.0|This explains all about airports, with a charming story as well. The familiar Richard Scarry characters are here, and there are fun pratfalls as well as accurate information. Great for very young travelers taking their first airplane trip.
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|This is one of the greatest series of our time!<br />Not only an excellent political drama.<br />Not only a quick witted.<br />All around well written excellent show.<br />Can't wait for the next season!
B0084B5TK8|5.0|This is one if my favorite books. I always enjoy reading it! I recommend it because I like the ending
B00CL8DKE2|5.0|This is a true form of Pet Shop Boys craft of music making and making it sound fresh and relevant.<br />Electronic music today should sound like this.<br /><br />There is no song on this album that is a filler, although shouting in the evening is not as good as the rest of the tracks.<br />Got this both in CD and vinyl.<br />Hopefully we will see a few singles come out of this production, which has taken the charts by storm.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|This game is awesome but at level 3-1 when I spawn I can't even move! I keep dying before I'm able to.  This happened to me on my kindle fire so I'm not sure if it only happens on kindles or something. I wouldn't give it 5 stars of that. They should really fix that
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I was young, when this came out, a true classic, and Cindy Lauper's song tracks is also a memory of a bygone Era.<br />We saw the kids acting in this movie all grow up, and now, almost 30 years ago, remember that great quest to find the pirate ship.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|From graphics to controls subway surfer is top notch. The concept is simple but as addictive. Reminiscent of Tetris . Overall excellent game
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|Downloaded fine on my Kindle Fire HD although others said would not work on theirs.  I put it on Zen mode which is not timed and it will let you continue playing even if screen is filled to top.  Zen mode is a good way to learn how the game functions and if you prefer to play at your own pace. I think the frustrated reviewer was playing one of the timed versions. I actually found it to be rather relaxing in the Zen mode once I got the hang of the game.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I am a Facebook addict honestly meaning I use this app a lot it works really good but occasionally it won't let me like pictures and that gets underway skin but other than that this is a really good app for Facebook
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Best keyboard app I've ever used. It's beyond intuitive and just keeps on getting better as it learns my style, lingo, and vocabulary.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This was the best mystery game ever. The graphics where amazing. I definitely love G5 games and I can't wait to play more. I definitely give it five stars.
B003YUC2FE|5.0|Movies got to me very quickly and pricing was great. Would definitely recommend to friends! No issues with discs or digital downloads.
