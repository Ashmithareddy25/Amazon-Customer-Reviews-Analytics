B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book! It is my favorite out of the whole trilogy. Yes all of them could have done without the million oh My's. And holy @$$% ( really too many) but I love this love story. Cant wait to see the movie.
B005LAIHSG|1.0|Why would such great actors think this is the movie to star in? Good acting I suppose but the movie itself is bull
B000N2HBSO|5.0|No history text book could match this chronicle.  It is so full of detail. The amount of research is overwhelming. I love the subject of Lincoln and find my self absorbed in this work.
B005LAIGOQ|3.0|Interesting premise, but i just couldnt get into it. I dont know why but i just couldnt. They are making either a sequal or a follow up.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|I saw \\"Super 8\\" at the cinema. I loved it. It's such a non typical movie for our times; it's so nostalgic, with all the magic and climate of the 1980s films. As soon as it was released in blu-ray, I bought it. So far, I must have seen it about 10 times. It is a top 5 hit among my students of English. Every time I see it again, I love it even more and more...and so my students. Spielberg and JJ Abrams are the magic duo. I hope they continue working together. In this movie you get the originality of Lost combined with the magic of Jurassic Park. Two wizards of suspense of different generations (obviously JJ is Steven's fan) working together, joining forces. Don't miss this masterpiece!!!<br />I feel so sad that it did not do well during the awards season earlier this year
B002GHHHG0|5.0|A collection of Stephen Kings stories, and he does not dissapoint. You get monster in crates, Zombies coming back from the ocean. Fathers day suprises (wink) , and other things on par with Tales From The Crypt. If you love horror, you'll love this.
B005LAIHRC|2.0|First, I should say that Tom Cruise is not my favorite guy/actor, whatever, in the world. I own only two of his movies. I think that his best performances have been only when he got the right director in charge. Well, all my theory went to the trash when I saw \\"Rock of Ages\\". The movie is a mediocre musical (and I love musicals), the director, Adam Shankman, dissapointed me with Hairspray and now he did it again. Oh boy, this guy doesn't understand that he is not the new Bob Fosse?. The cast is superb, all people who know about musicals, especially Catherine Zeta Jones. I really prefer to remember her wonderful performance in Chicago and forget she was in this movie. And I thought that Cruise was going to ruin the movie!! All the contrary, he saved it. I must admit. Also, I doubted he could sing, I really thought he was being dubbed until I checked the credits. Seeing is believing. Well, Tom, you saved this movie from sinking in the bottom of the ocean. He is the only actor that took his character seriously, did his work, learned to sing I suppose, and really transformed into a rock star sort of Steven Tyler meets Axel Rose. And he did well, he deserves a nomination to some award. All the rest of the film is pretty bad. If you want to colaborate with the profits of this film, don't buy the movie, just the buy the soundtrack.<br />And the 1980s was not the Age of Rock guys, that was the 60s and 70s. The 1980s was better known for its pop music. I should know, I come from the pop generation, and I'm very proud of. God save Madonna! (and the late Michael Jackson)
B001TODCII|3.0|Its an interesting film, I find it kinda funny when a moron mom lets her moron daughter go into a forein country and do moron things. Two morons equal trouble. I like action movies but this just isnt my cup of tea, but its not a bad movie. My sort of spy thriller is more like La Femme Nikita with Peta Wilson.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|I was very dissapointed with the reviews from the media about this movie, in the US and in my country, Argentina. I do not know if the critics are narrow minded or they just don't get the magic that Tim Burton and Johnny Depp create together, in every movie they've made, some better than other but all of them just wonderful.<br />In my opinion, as a fan and follower of Burton since I was 13 years old (I'm 35 now), Dark Shadows is the most \\"Burtonian\\" movie since \\"Mars attacks\\", full of that scent of satire and black humor that I loved in \\"Mars\\". But now it's even better because we have the mixture of Burton + Depp. These two guys were meant for each other (with respect to their wives).<br />I went to see it with a friend who is a fan of Johnny, but she doesn't really get the \\"Burton\\" style. She did not like it. It was a shame I went with her jjaa. That first time I like it and I gave it an 8 in my scale, but the second time I saw it, now in blu-ray, I liked it even more. Last week I saw it again with one of my students and my Mom. Both of them loved it. Case closed: media critics know nothing! It's the most \\"Burtonian\\" and personal movie since \\"Big Fish\\". Between then until Dark Shadows, Tim devoted his time to more commercial films, not that I did not enjoy them, but I prefer more of this kind of work.<br />The cast is superb as always. Also, he hires the same actors again. Thanks God, he hired Michelle for this one. After her masterpiece work as Catwoman, I was wondering why Tim waited 20 years to call her back for a role. She's one of the greatest actresses of all time. And for Depp, I wonder what weird role he still has ahead; I think he's done almost everything. The Acadamy should give up and give him an Oscar before he's too old to hold it!!!
B0001US62I|4.0|Robert De Nero and Micky Rourke? How can you lose? Good acting, good story, and some killings. you just cant lose with this amazing duo.
B008WCP2KG|1.0|I would not recommend this movie to anyone.  I couldn't get 1/2 through it and I turned it off.  I tried to give it away but no one wanted it.
B0015D3YQI|3.0|Interesting movie with good gore, and death scenes. Jennifer Connelly is a great actress. The setting is also spoody, and the special affects are superb.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I want to play on defensive mode but how do I do that I want to fight things but all I can do is build. and its boring.
B005LAIGPA|4.0|I liked this movie. Alot of neat special effects with good acting. The only problem i have with this movie is the message that every time some poor guy with emotional problems gets powers he's going to use them to kill someone or torture animals. WTF
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Was taken in on the first page, great characters,  great story, addressing a very important issue in society can't wait for more.
B009CPES4I|4.0|The light in India is talked about in the movie, I t shows what a beautiful place India is. Also some of the social failings of Indian Society. The Untouchables.<br />Good character developement, great cast and acting.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great, thought provoking read....A must read for those seeking wisdom in uncommon sources. Truly enjoyed this book as a kindle
B009NPM5Y2|4.0|It was cheesy, funny, over the top, and just what a real 80's movie would have been like.  I would watch it again.
0547884591|5.0|I could sit here and write an essay about why this book is awesome, but me even putting in the effort to send in this is good enough.
B0098VYKSA|2.0|This was not a great pick.  I felt Kristen Stewart was wooden. The plot dragged a bit.  The whole gave me a yawn.
1419705849|5.0|Loved the price for the hardback book.  My son loves these books and liked this one just as much as the others he has read. In his opinion, we would recommend this book to those who like the series.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Definitely a fan of Patricia Cornwell, always suspenseful<br />she takes many twists and turns  that make it very hard to put the book down.
B004BSFC6Y|2.0|these hardly fit on my 7 week olds feet, as they have very little stretch. the rattles are also super quiet, so he isnt that interested in the sound.
B0000AK7AA|4.0|I have seen the movie quiet a few times. My son seen it on tv and fell in love with it, he is 2 years. As i tryed my best to look for it everywhere @ a reasonabe price, the only place i found was Amazon. The only place i found was here too.  Extremely quick shipping and great protection shipping box. This is going to make a great stocking stuffer for him!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Although it was almost unbelievable  how many positive breaks Victoria had in the short time after leaving the foster care system, I still really enjoyed this book. Very well written. The Langauge of Flowers intertwined sparked my interest in knowing more.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Just good clean fun. Doesn't tie into the other movies but is fun to watch. Five more words are required
B00005JM02|5.0|this was a great replacement for my Finding Nemo disk that broke I while back. It has everything that I wanted and more
B002ZG97LK|5.0|Footloose was brand new. It came on time and it was exactly as was described. I am very happy I got this movie so cheap.
B0098VXBIA|3.0|Totally predictable but well paced, multiple stories twisted together well. An easy watch for most. . No foul langauge or sex scenes.
B009HELT3C|3.0|Just like previous versions. Geared for young people, fell asleep before the ending.<br />Gave it three stars for graphics and special efffects.
B0086DBE62|1.0|Did not expect much but almost immediately turned silly,silly and between dialogue and acting, never watched it all.  Not recommended. Do Snow White and the Huntsman instead.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|A lovely adaptation of the classic children's novel. The Secret Garden has been a favorite book of mine since I was a child and this movie is a practically perfect portrayal of the story. The script took only a few liberties beyond the original story, primarily how Mary's parents die. In the movie, they die in an earthquake, in the book they die of a Cholera outbreak in India. The book's version gives a lot of insight into who Mary is, and where she comes from, but would probably taken up too much screen time to tell it all.<br /><br />The movie embellishes a little bit from the book regarding Mary, Dicken, and Colin's relationship. It adds a few vignettes that show how attached Colin is to Mary, in almost a possessive way, which certainly fits with Colin's character, who is not used to people nor sharing. There's a great scene that shows Colin getting quite jealous when he notices that Mary and Dicken seem to have a bit of a crush on each other. It's really quite sweet, and I actually wouldn't have minded that being written into the book.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie for anyone of any age. It's a sweet, uplifting story that anyone can relate to: feeling not wanted or afraid of life and finding in yourself that you can rise above that, even if it's a small way, such as bringing life back to an abandoned garden. The theme of renewal of life and happiness will not be lost on adults and children will discover new growth and wonder right along with Mary, Colin, and Dicken.<br /><br />For parents, PLEASE read the book to your kids first. It will make their experience watching the movie so much more enjoyable as they see their imagination brought to life on the screen. The movie did bring some new things for me, seeing the moors and hearing the Welsh accents were something I could not have fully imagined as a kid, and when I re-read the book later, it brought new life to how I imagined the story.<br /><br />It's hard to find movie's that are really kid friendly in theaters. I've been extremely disappointed in a number of animated and family films in the last few years, that bring in rude language and sexual overtones that is ridiculously inappropriate for movies marketed to young children. You won't find one bit of that in the Secret Garden. It's movie with a good moral story that parent's can feel good about showing to their children. Rent it or buy it, you'll love it!
B009CPJHY4|3.0|A nice little bit of nothing set in India, with a good cast of characters. Several stories to hear and some new to watch develop. No great eye opener here bot still delightful.
B005LAII62|2.0|The stop motion animation was stunning , which accounts for one star. The actual overall story arc: fantastic; one more star. But that is it. All ruined by too many crass and tasteless moments.<br /><br />I was bothered by the way several of the characters were dressed/created with obvious sexual overtones. Too much adult humor and not enough playfulness. In fact, in the opening scene, Norman's mother asked him what he was up to and he replied, \\"Watching sex and violence\\". Really??? Personally, I wouldn't let any kid under the age of 12 to it. If you are planning on letting young kids watch, please read the parent's guide. And honestly, that didn't really paint a picture of how inappropriate some of the content is. I was extremely disappointed.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|Liked the first as dialogue was sharp, witty, plot moved along and special effects good and film had some life in it, some snap. This one does not have much of anything. Feels like scrips ere read and that is it. Poor excuse for a sequel.
0547884591|5.0|I have bought a large amount of cookbooks during the past year, and none of them have satisfied me as The 4-Hour Chef. It is amazing how easy Ferris explains everything; it is really a cookbook for people who doesn't buy cookbooks.<br /><br />But this isn't just for cooking, it applies for a lot everyday life stuff too. Simply great.<br /><br />I'm glad I purchased this (btw, the printed version is beatiful).
B003WJQ74E|5.0|A very interesting story of how a man was changed from a retarded man with an IQ of 68 to a genius of 170, through injections and maze experiments, in comparison to a mouse. Charlie lived two completely different lives at opposite ends of the spectrum.  Fascinating.
B006ON41FC|2.0|This game would definitely be fun, but I'm on the Kindle Fire HD and the screen flips upside down before the game play starts.  If I flip it around after it flips itself, it flips the screen back the other way.  How do I fix this?
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app is easy to use, and does it's job.  The alarm sounds are plesant and the clock is easy to set.
B00A4GXJD0|4.0|KR always has a story to tell and he's able to tell it through his music. He once again takes us along as he blends different beats until it ends up as Kid Rock American Rock and Roll! Kid Rock always makes you feel like he's having a good time and you want to join the party.
B007WULJ5G|5.0|This is the uncut 104 minute long film no deleted scenes plus you can save it to your computer with it's digital copy feature and all the extras are on the disk I recommend this this movie if you like to think outsidenthe box if not pass on this one
B005KR6OBM|5.0|best show on tv and only show I watch.  Cant wait to get the entire 6th season box set and hope this show lasts for a lot more seasons
0547884591|5.0|Like his first two books, The 4-Hour Chef is a massive collection of what it means to be Timothy Ferris. I'll be reading and re-reading this book for a long time to come to even begin to absorb all that it contains!
B009IF82SK|5.0|best show on tv and only show I watch.  Cant wait to get the entire season box set and hope this show lasts for a lot more seasons
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Fabulous writing, I'm a big Darabont fan and love the creative team that he's put together including the SFX master himself, Greg Nicotero who's even directed several of the episodes.
B007KFZ7RE|5.0|old style sound with a good beat. heavy on the horns with good singing and rhythm. a nice change of pace
B004YCKJSS|5.0|I watched this movie on pay-for-view late one night.  There were a lot of actors/actresses that I knew & like.  So I thought it was worth the money just to see them.  But I was surprisingly blown away by the performance of this young teenage girl (Natalie Portman).  She was just so authentic, true, to me she made the movie.  I was so blown away by her performance that I had to talk to somebody about it so I woke up my wife (which I rarely do) to let her know I saw this incrediable performance.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|I love being able to listen to my music in the order I want to listen to it in. So sweet.
0547884591|5.0|Great Author, Great Book! I couldn't put it down!! Tim also has some other books. My favorite is the four hour work week - check it out
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Love being able to print from anywhere. This app lets me print from any location I can be at. So nice.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Eric Blehm sums up my feelings of this book in the afterward when he says \\"I knew what was coming, but I hoped for a different outcome. . . somehow.\\"  If you're looking for a book about strategies and tactics of NAVY SEALs, this isn't it, but you should still read it.  I knew the gist of this book before I started reading it, but the author's descriptions of Adam's childhood immediately pull you in.  You're then taken on an emotional rollercoaster as Adam struggles with drug addiction and relapse, before getting his life on the right track and becoming both a dedicated family man and an elite warrior.  Finally, there's a sense of dread as you realize that you're getting close to the end, and sadness when you reach it. As another reviewer said, this is a book to read alone (especially so with the last couple chapters), but that you'll want others to read.  Adam Brown's story will make your problems seem trivial and reinforce your appreciation for everything you have.
B00902MCVY|3.0|I have to start by saying that I LOVE Ensiferum and Jari. While his first solo album as Wintersun was a bit of a departure from the typical Ensiferum tracks, it was still great. However, this is a pretty large departure from Ensiferum and even his first solo album as Wintersun. Epic? Perhaps... His best work? I dunno, as a metal album I would say that it's not. Overdue? VERY. 8 years for 5 songs, two of which are basically intros, is pretty silly in my opinion. I will say that the production is very clean and well done, you can tell that it took time. However, it should have probably taken half the time it did.<br /><br />More on the music though, there is metal here but you really have to hunt for it. This is more of a soundtrack, one that would be at home in a movie like Lord of the Rings, with a smattering of metal thrown in there. Lots of symphonic instruments and keyboards in the background. This is nothing new for Jari, however, I feel like the keyboards are just the same two or three patterns/ tunes thrown into all 5 songs on the album. Unfortunately for me, this is not something \\"breathtaking\\" or \\"epic\\" or even \\"metal album of the year\\", instead I find it to be a somewhat saddening departure from one of my most favorite metal artists. If you are in the mood for a dark symphony rather than metal then this is your album, but if you are like me then you may be a bit disappointed. All that being said, the production values are great and the music is not that bad despite its new style.
0547884591|5.0|With this, Mr. Ferris has achieved his goal of writing pertinent information from a health, wealth and wisdom perspective.<br /><br />The concepts given, when applied, will help one gain skill sets quicker, which reinforces the conscious learning initiative.  That momentum can be ridden to further master a skill or learn complimentary skills.  All this under the guise of cooking, which is brilliant in my opinion.  One of the things I enjoyed most with this book is the \\"choose your own adventure\\" ordering.  Another plus is the layout and readability.<br /><br />I would put 4-Hour Chef a notch below 4-Hour Workweek and above the 4-Hour Body.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book and all the others to. I love Suzanne Collins. She did a great job, and I hope to read more books writen by her. The Hunger Games are the best series EVER:):):):):)!!! You need to that Katniss is.a.human being to. You can't judge anyone in this book to harshly (ecept for Snow and Coin).
B008LY9AWG|5.0|Love to read this author books, it is hard to put down. A must read and a great addition to my library.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|So addicting that I just can't stop playing it. This is a really cool game that gets the brain going. You will simply love!

B0052RDHTM|3.0|Gives a good view of the upheavals of the 20th century, seen from individual points of view.  Some of it is banal and the writing can be trite.  But Follett knows all the tricks to keep you turning the pages and even caring about (some) of the characters.
0345803493|3.0|I am very sorry I bought the trilogy. If I had waited until I read the first one, I could have saved myself some money. In my opinion, very poorly written.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|This should be required reading for anyone with ideas about racial superiority or the Third World's &#34;failure.&#34;  At times, the Borneo bits get long, but overall a must-read.
B001B51B9M|5.0|I've been watching this classic since I was a kid.  Great family movie for a lazy day. Pure fun for all!
B0017VQB40|5.0|Good music and fantastic choreograph. Although this is an old movie it still gives a warm romantic feeling with a premonition of doom.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This is awesome :)My bestie showed me this its really good ill  give it 10 starts if possible lol<br />Kik me LizzyBear99 im free to talk :3
B000FC1MCS|4.0|I really enjoyed how different this book was from anything else I have read. There were times when I would finish a chapter and then stare out the window contemplating it all. I loved that. It is also an enriching experience to view the world through the perspective of someone like Christopher - an autistic savant. Great read. Only wish it was actually written by him as the book implies. How cool would that be?
B009KUANWG|4.0|Excellent tune for a marvelous film sung by a vocal prodigy...one for the ages.I thought of the seminal themes sung by Dame Bassey and this ranks among the top.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|How addictive can a stupid aquarium game be? Apparently VERY, because I've totally completed it two times now and am working on my third installment. Don't play the free sample unless you're prepared to buy the full game. It'll let you get nearly done with the second level before it makes you pay to get the rest. I said, &quot;Screw that!&quot; and went about my business. After the third day of pining after the game I broke down and bought it. Call me a sucker, but I'm glad I did. This game is just plain fun. It's not as hard as The Call of Atlantis and thus not as frustrating. It's all doable and slightly challenging to a perfect degree. I also love the sound effects. There is something terribly satisfying about the sound of those chains breaking--almost like coins dropping from a slot machine. There must be a study out there somewhere of the effect of the sound of coins on the happy cells in your brain. The same thing that keeps those idiots glued to their seats in a casino will keep you glued to this game. Very, very fun.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Gone Girl is a psychological thriller with many twists and turns.  However, it eventually becomes predictable and the ending leaves you disappointed.
B009MB682W|5.0|Really easy to download and easy to play on windows media player. Songs were really good.<br />Just mist the new one from Skyfall.
0307951529|2.0|Maybe the first chapter should have been &#34;Spend $100 on lattes while writing a book on creating a startup&#34;.  Writing another book on startups would be the only way.  Must be marketed towards the retired or something.  To be fair this is a tired subject.  There are no magic pills to creating a business.  That's why mostly only obsessive type A's do it.
B000U0F7RG|3.0|This show should be renamed &#34;Having their Cake and Eating It, Too.&#34; And Lorelai and Rory prefer their proverbial cakes to be subsidized either by wealthy (but clueless) relatives or by doormat men whose function is to enable these gals to do whatever they please and to be as fabulous as they believe themselves to be. For all their much-vaunted (attempts at) independence, this self-entitled mother-daughter tandem constantly relies on the rich WASPs or handy men in their lives to bail them out, especially when the capital infusion or manual labor entailed is significant. Yet they are grudging when help comes with some strings - as though those approached for assistance should be the ones grateful for the privilege of aiding such worthy and deserving beneficiaries. Its witty banter and colorful characters are funny and amusing, but insidious, freighted as they are with a barely concealed and unchallenged progressive worldview whose soundness is assumed rather than established. It would have you ridicule and caricature traditional sources of individual and social restraints (e.g., Mrs. Kim's religiosity) and normalize, even celebrate, the contemporary values that purport to supplant them, no matter how indeterminate, contradictory, bankrupt, and, well, flaky these are. Just as Lorelai and Rory cannot resist annotating the movies they watch with running commentaries, this show ought not to be foisted on the impressionable and gullible without supplying context and a counter-narrative.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|All I can say is \\"WOW!\\" I completely missed this in the theater. My then-15-year-old daughter went to see it with her friends. She saw parts of \\"The Dark Knight\\" and never saw \\"Batman Begins\\", so I'm sure many parts didn't make sense in this movie. Yet, she still loved it and thought it was excellent.<br /><br />The Dark Knight was my favorite of the first two, but I think this HAS to be the best one. What a way to end it. Definitely the best of the three movies.<br /><br />I don't want to rehash the story, but let it be known that Batman does NOT make a lot of showing in this movie. It's more of Bruce Wayne and his struggles as a \\"retired\\" superhero. But when Bruce dons the Caped Crusader's costume, the excitement is still there. This isn't just about Batman. It's about a city and it's people, as well as many of the characters we know and love, that has lived under a lie for 8 years. A lie that was meant to help the city that eventually comes back to haunt it and the people who perpetuated that lie. Old friends and nemesis are revealed and come full circle to bring closure to the trilogy. And new characters are revealed that leave possibilities for new story lines for possible future movies. Just not sure if Mr. Nolan would be involved. But, this final movie of the trilogy does SO much justice for the entire Batman franchise.<br /><br />Mr. Nolan must be commended on an awesome job well done. He pulled Batman out of the steaming pile of junk that Joel Schumacher created (never saw Batman and Robin when it came out and just last year, I TRIED to watch it and had to stop after the first 15 minutes. Just plain awful) and saved him. The Dark Knight INDEED has risen back to his rightful place as one of the best superheroes out there.

B007HACDLK|4.0|Flynn obviously took the criticism of has last, rather short, novel to heart.  This one is 450 pages of actual story without the marketing/advertising summaries of all his other work included as in the last one.  Rapp does seem to be getting more over-the-top with each new novel, but then so is the terrorist world.  Good addition to the series.
B008JJM88Q|3.0|I love this app but there is one MAJOR ISSUE: the update process. I have to purchase the app again in order to have the update. I don't want to make the purchase again but the game seems to not work since I have received notification of an update available. now says there is a network problem no matter what I try (i.e. restart kindle, Internet connection or app itself). please fix this. App is too fun to have such a major flaw. never have I had an app do this.

B007L6VR12|5.0|Loved this quirky, clever, soul satisfying movie. The big name actors (Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, Bill Murray, Harvey Keitel) did a wonderful job downplaying their larger-than-life selves and letting the two teenage stars shine. The adults were a wonderful supporting cast for the two young stars. Highly recommend this movie.

B008YZ4RR0|3.0|For one thing it cost twice as much as the other Jesse Stone movies on Amazon Prime. It took on more of the air of a skin flick. Sort of like some of the series that have to rely in sex to survive. It sort of soured me from looking at the rest of the Jesse Stone movies.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Thank you for your excellent service that you provide me daily.<br />I love my experience that I have everytime I use it.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|Okay. So this is an excellent headset to use for the xbox 360 and ps3. When you purchase it it comes with all of the cables needed to hook it up to your xbox 360 controller (haven't used it for the ps3. I do have a ps3 but don't use ps3 for gaming, just for the blu-ray player and playing dvds).<br /><br />I've had it almost a year and a half. here is one of my huge problems with it.<br />It is very, very fragile. When taking it off your head treat it like it is an expensive piece of hardware, because it is.<br />When I took it off a few weeks ago the swivel to the earbud broke inside the frame. ***It's designed to break***, so you have to either repair it yourself (very carefully, but easily fixed, so you don't pinch the wire) or buy a new headset (about $70, ERV).<br />Sadly it is not covered under the warranty, since I do not have the receipt, and it was gifted to me by a relative.<br />The fix is provided below. You are either going to fix it or buy a new one anyway. So try it if you want to try to salvage your headset. There are videos on how to fix the headphones too on youtube but the video's contributors have long since left the videos dead so don't count on getting any help from turtlebeach about these unless they're still under warranty.<br /><br />My recommendation: Buy it, if you're tired of buying those crappy $15 microsoft headsets. Good investment, and a good gift for this upcoming christmas / black friday at best buy.<br />You are heard very well in the mic, and it cuts off background noise when you are wearing these.<br /><br />To fix: You need a piece of metal about 2 inches long, a quarter inch thick, which can be easily bent to the conform of the headset.<br />You also need two small screws, and washers to match (I would get about 2 washers per screw, to distance the screw enough so it doesn't pinch the wire, but enough so it will \\"bite\\" into the headset).<br /><br />Not a troll, and not trying to kill amazon's business. Just posting on a review on this fabulous headset.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I don't own a PS3, but I purchased this to use with the Sixaxis app for use on my Nexus 7. I use it for playing Android games, including emulation. As an OEM controller, the build quality is excellent, the buttons have good response time, and the controller feels light in the hand - a comfortable fit. Amazon has the best price, and I was not in a hurry, so I chose free shipping. Unit arrived in about a week, as projected, so I am very happy with this purchase.

B00846REIS|2.0|I read this book because I was told it was like fifty shades of gray. I have to admit the books do not compare. The story line was good but it almost made me feel like it \\"want to be\\" spin off of FSG.  There was so many story lines( the mother, father, roommate, etc...) but there was no ending or fore seeing what happened to those relationships. FSG gave you in depth reading story lines and made you want more. I have never read books like those before. I found myself reading all three of the books in 2 days and then going back and rereading them because they are written so well and it makes you pull for both sides.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|It's Sherlock Holmes after all.  Miller does a great modern take on the Holmes character as does Liu with the Watson character.  Then Aidan Quinn shines as the inspector.  The episodes are fresh, exciting and enough related to the real thing to keep you in your seat.  I recommend it to all my friends.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I've finished about all the free levels, it's just the right amount of free.  They start off very easy, but blast through them, you need the practice as you get to the higher levels.  One level took me working on it for almost 3 weeks, but I figured it out.  No I didn't spend all 3 weeks on it, but it was hard enough to be the challenge I had to master.<br /><br />There's another version with Bridges, that is interesting too, and a bit harder.

B007W8S2MG|5.0|This is by far the first Jrpg game that has ever got me addicted as much as Kingdom Hearts and Pokemon.. The game has beautiful music, fun battles, characters and and a interesting story. I already saw the animation.. I love anime more than games but this game is as great as the anime.. However the biggest problem I have is the lack of Dual audio.. Sometimes i want to mute Teddie, Chie, Yukiko just for the fact they are most annoying voices in English.. Igor was the only one I hated in japanese which is far better than having the 3 main characters sound sooo lame.. this however doesn't impact the game for me as much.. The vita cards go up to 32 gb so it wouldn't have been a problem to just add dual audio.. Though I see the problem in terms of importing.<br /><br />so listen if you love Anime, Rpgs, Japanese culture, fun!, games and have a PSvita then there is absolutely no reason for you not to play this game..
B001AITH50|4.0|You've read Interview with the Vampire by Anne Rice haven't you? If not don't watch this movie until you've read it!<br /><br />It took me along time to accept the idea of Tom Cruise playing a vampire. A very long time. It seemed ridiculous. I couldn't possibly picture him doing it in any good way. But eventually I ended up watching the movie.<br /><br />Tom Cruise looked totally unlike himself in this movie. The film was made in the mid 90s so that might have something to do with it. But it was more than that. He looked totally unlike himself and he did an incredible job acting for this movie. I don't know how this came to be. Somehow he set aside his type mediocre acting for exceptional acting in this film.<br />Enough about Tom Cruise though.<br /><br />This movie begins, as the book does, with a young man asking the vampire Louis for an interview. Louis agrees to tell his life story. Louis has his own personal reasons for doing this. He feels a need to tell his story and that the time is right to do so.<br /><br />The film skips the details of Louis' background. From there it stays fairly close to the book while leaving out a large amount of detail. For example, the wealth that Louis brought with him that allowed him to lead the lifestyle that he had.(Not to mention loot from dead victims.)<br />The characterization and character development of the movie is very strong. Philosophical questions are explored and discussed. That is largely what the book is all about and Anne Rice was involved in the project to make sure he vision was realized.<br />The cinematography of this film is very good. I didn't notice it lacking at all. And poor cinematography and directing is what often kills otherwise good stories. But that wasn't the case here so I was pleased.<br />It was a fun and moving film to watch even though I knew the story. But with truly great novels they deserve to be read first before any movie adaption is seen.<br />The ending of the film, is a little different from what I remember in the book. But I think that perhaps it was meant to be a hint at next book and Lestat taking the role of a rockstar.<br />I think this was a very good film adaption of an incredible novel.<br />The movie is not a masterpiece(few films are) but it is very good. I recommend it to anyone who has read the book.

0812550757|5.0|I loved reading this book. Just make sure that you read Enders Game before you read Speaker for the Dead
B0094K1MH2|5.0|I never heard of this movie until my 8-year old said he wanted to watch it. I thought it was very funny, with the characters well developed and just the right blend of real and imaginary.<br /><br />Serious note: when will producers/directors stop portraying blows to the head a producing a brief unconsciousness with no lasting effect? With what we know today about concussions, it seems irresponsible to put such scenes in movies.
0547884591|4.0|To start, good book, worth buying.  I'm a fan and have applied a lot of his tips and principles to my everyday life but I don't think he's as infallible as some of my friends. Maybe I'm beginning to expect too much but when he said this was the book he's wanted to write since college I expected nothing short of awesome.<br /><br />**side note about myself for perspective: I'm an economist, semi pro athlete (in a lesser known but still popular sport), successful business man and decent cook so Tim often speaks my language<br /><br />The book is easy to read and pretty easy to follow but you often lose the forest for the trees.  His focus is always on deconstructing things, breaking them down into master-able skills that can be reapplied to similar situations but he falls short of his own goals. Let me give you an example, one of his first lessons (05) is on Crab Cakes.  He does a great job of breaking down knife skills but poor job of explaining the pan frying (a skill I use almost daily in cooking along with sautéing and searing).  I thought, \\"maybe he'll come back to it and build on it\\" but not really. I was thinking he was going to actually deconstruct the dishes and talk about why they work but there is little of that. It's more like \\"look! You successfully pan fried. Pat yourself on the back and don't fear it anymore\\" when I'm sitting there waiting for a break down that can then be applied to other dishes not in the book.<br /><br />I've read it cover to cover. I'm almost done with all the lessons in \\"The Domestic\\" and plowed through \\"The Scientist\\" and \\"The Professional\\" but I'm left wanting... unsatisfied (skipped The Wild for now but still read it).  I realize the book would be 1000+ pages if he added what I was expecting but that's the impression and expectation he set for me even in the opening chapters of his book. All in all, my critique is a good buck he bit off more then he could chew, or digest in this case.

B000NY12LO|5.0|Product was shipped quickly and arrived as described. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and the transaction. Would buy from this seller again.
0547884591|5.0|I first stumbled across the 4 Hour Body, and devoured it.  Within a week of reading it I was dropping weight and getting ART therapy on a shoulder months of rehab wasn't helping.  Then I got 4 Hour Workweek (out of order, but shoot, I found it!), and wanted to emulate it.  I'm working on launching an internet business and my wife and I are slated for a trip to Europe in the Spring!  \\"Get to the review already!\\"  I decided to splurge this holiday season and add another 4 Hour to my week and my bookshelf.<br /><br />The 4-Hour Chef arrived on launch day (thank you Amazon pre-order!).  We celebrated its arrival with champagne and circumstance, I've never had a better un-boxing!  The cover is fantastic, pictures don't seem to do the art justice.  This book is a monster.  It sits on my night-stand and our breakfast bar with a quiet majesty more fitting for the Space Odyssey's monolith than a cook-book.  This is appropriate.  It is not a cook book.<br /><br />The book introduced me early to a concept I was intimately familiar with, yet never knew existed: meta-learning.  Why was I so terrible at (count them) American Sign Language, French, Spanish and Latin?  How did I manage to pull off Italian by studying abroad in Italy?  Why was my jump shot so terrible in basketball?  How come learning pick-up was so much better after I finished reading The Game and started actually going out?  Tim explains the principles of learning in an entertaining and engaging fashion.  I find it difficult to categorize the reading as research, self-help or entertainment.  It is through his unique style that I have been able to enjoy reading to learn for the first time in years.  I am still working my way through meta-learning, a section that constitutes maybe the first sixth of the book, but makes the book worth the price tag.<br /><br />As with the past books, this 4-Hour edition makes me want to get out there and start learning (and get into the kitchen to start cooking).  I think it would bea great gift, but don't be surprised if you order a copy for yourself after seeing the first!

B009FZHYKU|5.0|The third season has proven to be a peerless development of a continuing story.  Season1 gave us a rag tag band of disillusioned survivors desperate to find any means for rescue from the inescapable fate before them and the main threat to existence were the 'Walkers'.  Season 2 had that group become more seasoned in the art and tactics of surviving; running was not the only means of existence anymore which left the seeds of distrust and in fighting to be nurtured, take root, and grow into near civil war in the troop.  Season 3 now has them as experienced warriors, like old fashioned Dungeons & Dragons our level one band of rogues, conjurers, and fighters have become level 10 veterans who charge right into their old nemeses like hot knives through butter.  The walkers are now the side story and the real threat to the world, just as in real life, are the humans themselves.

B0076DEJMO|5.0|Big fan of the series and this one doesn't disappoint. Reading the description I was afraid it would be a remash of Best Served Cold, but in fact it has a &#34;Frontier&#34; personality all of its own. Yes, Abercrombie could've been more daring in the fate reserved to some key characters. Yes, some of the witty repartie between protagonists can sometimes drag on to uncomfortable levels. Yes, the second to last chapter could’ve (and should’ve) been taken out entirely. But the same can be said of many timeless classics of the genre.<br /><br />Plus all the ingredients that made the other books in the series such page turners and guilty pleasures are there: the violence and gore, the epic-yet-gritty scenery, the fallible anti-heroes, the dark and moody inner dialogues, etc. Can't wait for the next one!

B007A4SDCG|5.0|I bought the paperback years ago and have recently downloaded it to my Kindle.  I love the down-to-earth language.  The chapters are short and focused.  It's a book about work, just doing it and getting it done, or else it doesn't get done and you're left with nothing.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Rod Stewart lends the same quality to these Christmas songs as he does those in his Easy Listening albums.  I love his music and this album is no exception.  There's a wide variety here, from Christmas classics to the more modern &#34;Red-Suited Super Man.&#34;  My favorites are &#34;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&#34; and &#34;Winter Wonderland&#34; done with Michael Bubl&eacute;.  He does a duet with the late Ella Fitzgerald that's marvelous: &#34;What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?&#34;  His duet with Cee Lo Green on &#34;Merry Christmas, Baby&#34; is fun and his final guest star, Mary J. Blige sings with him on &#34;We Three Kings.&#34;  I could go on about the other songs, but they're listed above.  This is a must album for Rod Stewart fans and anyone else looking for a good collection of Christmas and New Year's songs, and the classic, &#34;When You Wish Upon a Star.&#34;
0743270754|5.0|I am totally enjoying this book.  Doris Goodwin writes a story, not just the dry history of the era.  It isn't just Lincoln who is fascinating but all of the gentlemen who worked with him.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great movie and fantastic trilogy too bad Christopher Nolan won't probably be involved in the Justice league universe due to his desire to move on from the comic book world. I hope that Warner bros keeps the dark tone from this trilogy as they have seen what a light tone interpretation of dc superheroes does to the movie. The Joel Schumacher era was terrible don't do that again. Watch Arrow on CW its a great show that takes inspiration from the Nolan with a dark tone. We are all waiting for more Deathstroke who now has a great actor to play him. Manu Bennett from the starz Spartacus series.
B009ZQGNPQ|5.0|This story is fabulous on all levels. Writing, acting, scenery, suspense between episodes...  I've watched seasons 1 and 2 twice each and am very excited that one more season is right around the corner!
0547884591|5.0|So far I've cooked Osso \\"Buko\\" and scrambled eggs from the Domestic section. The simple lessons offered in this book change the way you use kitchen tools and prepare meals. Tim shows a systematic way to effectively learn anything, using cooking as the backdrop.<br /><br />It's an awesome hardcover book with great photos and great design. I daresay this book is actually exciting to read and implement. You won't regret a decision to buy and apply this book.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I watch American Idol, but I don't normally buy the music.  However I love every song on this album, which is unusual.  Phillip's voice and the song styles are consistent throughout.

B008I34YYY|5.0|Many reviewers have referred to this movie as \\"camp\\" which I think belittles it unnecessarily.  Rocky Horror Picture Show was camp.  This is clever.  Would I recommend it to absolutely everyone without reservation?  No, it depends on your sense of humor.  But these days when all Hollywood spews out are screenplays based on a novel, or a comic book, or a sequel or a reboot or a remake, I found this wonderfully refreshing. (When Fifty Shades of Gray comes out we can look forward to a movie that was based on an atrocious novel that was adapted from a fan fiction that was inspired by the equally atrocious Twilight novels...ugh.)<br /><br />Keep in mind I only watched this to humor my husband, fully expecting to roll my eyes and scoff the entire time.  Instead I found myself highly entertained for the full 90 minutes.  Personally I enjoyed the special effects, realistic when appropriate and other times quite lyrical.  And the direction overall generated lots of energy.  I thought the acting was truly excellent, everyone sold their roles (with the possible exception of the \\"mad scientist\\" who did cross over the line to camp.)  Special mention must be given to the actress who played the main character, Renata. From a female perspective I found her to be completely believable and sympathetic as a woman of both intelligence and innocence, indoctrinated to prejudice and yet when confronted by a black man for the first time her reaction is a very human mixture of curiosity and compassion.  A woman bound by duty to a genetically matched mate, yet longing for a spark of romance from the insensitive clod. A gentle schoolteacher, who, it turns out is fully capable of kick-ass moves when the occasion calls for it.<br /><br />No, this is not Saving Private Ryan.  And should I review that movie I would give it 5 stars for cinematic brilliance, though I didn't enjoy watching it and have no intention of viewing it again.  Such is the dilemma of ratings.  If you're looking for somethingfun, different and likeable, take a chance on Iron Sky.

B001E7X4M4|5.0|On full-length release number four, Unearth finally knock one out of the park. It continues the band's tradition of gradually becoming \\"more metal,\\" a trend started back with 2006's \\"III: In The Eyes Of Fire,\\" and is completed here. Yes, there are some metalcore clich&eacute;s present, here, like chugga-chugga breakdowns, At The Gates-derived galloping rhythms, and In Flames-stylized harmonies. But for the most part, 2008's \\"The March\\" is metalcore only in attitude. It is mostly a thrash and groove metal album, albeit one that is mixed with melodeath.<br /><br />Of course, \\"The March\\" is also of note for being highlighted by some of Massachusetts-based quintet's best and most epic and dynamic/diverse songwriting to date. After releasing a few promising and potential-filled -- but ultimately monotonous-sounding -- albums (i.e. 2004's \\"The Oncoming Storm\\") in the past, Unearth finally offset their unbridled metal attack with a touch of nuance, and an increased sense of melody. And such a counterbalance of brutality and epic melody works to excellent -- and frequently quite amazing -- effect. Plus, one must not forget to mention the fact that this is a concept album. According to frontman Trevor Phipps, his lyricism this time around tells the story from both sides of the coin: The hopeful side of humanity, and the evil side. (The former represents Phipps' faith in mankind, and the latter details man's constant strive for money and power.)<br /><br />\\"My Will Be Done\\" opens with some nice, Necrophagist-like guitar harmonies laid over booming rhythms before turning to a powerful, inexorably hard-driving main riff, and thunderous, moshcore-worthy breakdowns. Also included, here, is a killer melodic guitar break with harmonized and wailing solos and siren-like guitar and keyboard harmonies. \\"Crow Killer\\" works in likewise fashion: Beginning with a harmonic guitar intro before charging straight ahead with a full-on metalcore assault, and tucking in a nice, winding melodic solo before the end. And so does \\"Hail The Shrine,\\" although this tune does vary the formula a little. It begins as a building, ascending, and terrifically slow burning tune before eventually hitting full stride with blistering, sprinting, abrasively grinding riffage and deft, pounding blast beats. The tune eventually shifts in a mid-tempo, chugging breakdown, as well as some semi-melodic vocals and distant, backing harmonies.<br /><br />\\"Gang Of Opportunity\\" is highlighted by a catchy, gang-style shouted part that rocks really hard; and the subsequent \\"We Are Not Anonymous\\" backs chunky power chords and power metal-lite guitar harmonies with tight, forceful, and propulsive double-time drumming. The title track features a catchy, chugging, galloping main riff anchored by thundering drums. And John Maggard completes the rhythm section by laying down some strong, fast, and steady bass lines. \\"Cutman\\" is a particularly thrashy number which interlocks buzzsaw riffing with impeccable, machine gun drumming.<br /><br />\\"The Chosen\\" is very possibly the highlight of the album. It begins with fiery, angry, busy thrash picking and catchy and inspired vocal patterns (including an old-school hardcore-flavored chorus). It eventually segues into a proggy section with a very exceptional, winding, and impressive melodic solo. Following the solo, the band seems content just to casually shred and fade-out; but then the thunderous main riff comes slamming back onto the scene. The end result is a positively epic and eminently memorable song. \\"Letting Go\\" is a full-on metalcore bruiser which plods along at a mid-tempo pace and with a chunky, galloping riff. Then, following the much slower and more restrained and richly-textured \\"Truth Or Consequence,\\" comes closing blast, \\"Our Callous Skin.\\" Unearth dig deep and plow through this song, a knock-out blow of pummeling blasts, thunderous rhythms, and brutal, hardcore-inflected thrash riffing. (Seriously, the guitar work in this song is someof the band's best to date -- it remains highly intricate, inventive, and technical throughout this song.)<br /><br />The bottom line? \\"The March,\\" which is easily Unearth's best album to date, is the great album that everybody knew the band had in them, but until this point, never got around to releasing. Therefore, it ought to be deemed as just about an essential listen for both fans and newcomers alike.band's best to date -- it remains highly intricate, inventive, and technical throughout this song.)<br /><br />The bottom line? \\"The March,\\" which is easily Unearth's best album to date, is the great album that everybody knew the band had in them, but until this point, never got around to releasing.

B004LWZWGK|4.0|The story of \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" starts slowly, but be patient. Eight years have passed since the conclusion of the previous entry, and now Bruce Wayne is seen hiding in his room, despite concerned Alfred advising him to move on. But, when a terrorist group led by Bane arrives in Gotham City, Bruce knows what he has to do. As Commissioner Gordon tells Bruce, \\"Batman has to come back.\\"<br /><br />And he does, though it takes some time. Once it happens, however, the story gets faster with more action set-pieces and some surprises. The character of Bane may not be as interesting as Heath Ledger's Joker, but he is convincing as a brutal and dangerous villain, thanks to Tom Hardy's effective performance, especially his voice.<br /><br />Christian Bale comes back as Bruce Wayne / Batman. There are many new characters introduced here - Anne Hathaway's martial arts fighting thief Selina Kyle and Marion Cotillard's Miranda Tate - as well as some of the familiar faces like Morgan Freeman's Lucius Fox and Michael Caine's Alfred Pennyworth. But to me the most impressive is Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Officer Blake, who sometimes seems more heroic than Batman himself.<br /><br />The Christopher Nolan-directed new Batman franchise started out as the origin story of Batman, and now ends in a fitting way.

B0063GORYU|5.0|I loved playing Spider Solitaire on my computer and was thrilled when I could get a portable version to play on my Kindle Fire. It also plays on my phone but it's too hard to use the touch screen in such a small area.<br /><br />As with the computer version, this app has a hint, undo and replay. One, two, three or four suits, timed, scored by the number of moves, etc.<br /><br />A great app that always starts out with an \\"ad\\" but it is easy enough to skip over.
B0098VXBIA|1.0|Ridiculous and not in a &#34;Bridesmaids&#34; way.  The only decent arc is the one with the adoption (Jennifer Lopez).  The rest are either typical stereotypes of pregnant women or so far-fetched they don't even make for a good story.  The miscarriage story is awfully done too.  Don't waste your time or money.
B008N1V11U|5.0|I don't have a Kindle but an Acer - so I must go to Google Play to get this - I can't even find the non-Kindle at Amazon - seems to be a trend - bummer. Great price though - wanted to get this game to play it - but with only Kindle Edition - I am out of luck.<br /><br />Now from what I have seen at the GameLoft site on the game and the reviews I have read hear and also on Google Play this game appears to rock. I love Batman and really look forward to playing this - but looks like I will need to wait for GameLoft to have their end of year sale and pick it up from them since I have an Acer Tablet and Motorola Droid 4 phones - not a Kindle.

1423140605|5.0|The book is awesome, my 11 year old daughter loves this series and is reading Mark of Athena (checked out from the library) right now.  She is a big fan of mythology and has read the previous Percy Jackson books leading up to this one, enjoying them thoroughly.<br /><br />She likes the book so much, she has asked for it for Christmas, so I ordered it from Amazon, of course.  Unfortunately, the order is apparently lost in transit, supposed to have been here 7 days ago.  If you've ever ordered from Amazon, you know that is CRAZY LATE.  I have never received anything after their estimated delivery date, much less 7 days.  So far Amazon has been very responsive and helpful.  Not sure if Prestige's Delivery Service lost the package or USPS.  Can't find out how the actually delivery was supposed to take place, Amazon's tracking service says Prestige was the deliverer.
0547884591|5.0|The only people who seem to be unhappy with this book are really missing the point in my opinion.  For me it's not about carbon copying what he's doing and exactly what he has chosen to do.  Apply the 80/20 to his own ideas and use what serves you.  If you were hoping to be as cool as Timbo Slice from reading a book, re-evaluate your life...<br /><br />I was tempted to leave a one star review, only because a few have caught Tim's attention and I'd like to challenge him to a duel.  If he valued his life he'd decline and instead accept an invitation to slay some trout up here in Canada this spring. Eh. I feel like he'd be handy on a canoe trip, for the anecdotes alone.  It would also be interesting to see if he could keep up with a man 10 years his junior.... paddling, fishing, drinking or otherwise ;).<br /><br />On a final note, I was disappointed to see that as a Canadian, I had a significant handicap in the book selling contest, it would have been a pleasure to chill in Tuscany sippin' wine and experimenting with grey poupon.  Probably even would have got him a gun rack, maybe even another gun to necessitate the entire rack... If you're not careful Tim, you're going to lose me.<br /><br />Love your biggest fan,<br /><br />Cory<br /><br />P.S. I hope you're not to sore about the old man comments and me undermining your duelling abilities...

0399160450|5.0|Have you ever read a book before whose theme just stayed in your mind to such an extent that you found yourself thinking about it long after you had finished reading it? That is what THREAT VECTOR has been for me. Part of the reason is because I recognize that the basic plot ideas here could actually become reality in some form. Could. That is a very important word in that sentence. Another part of the reason this story has stayed in my mind so strongly is that this collaborative effort between Tom Clancy and Mark Greaney has characters who come so vividly alive on the pages that I accept that this just might have actually happened to them. Yes, it is fiction, but it certainly does open up the possibilities of \\"what if...............\\".<br /><br />What if one nation had a secret cyber network in place now which could watch operatives of other governments carry out their missions in startling, minute, real time detail? What if that government had unlimited resources to continue to develop their technology to take over the United States, indeed the world, using this cyber warfare? And what if loss of life meant absolutely nothing to them as long as they accomplished their goal? It is the mission of Jack Ryan, Jr. and everyone else at The Campus to find this Chinese government Ghost Ship - the technology center - and destroy it, no matter how impossible the mission may seem. Can everyone survive this mission?<br /><br />I think this book was incredible. Quite a strong statement and yet, for me, it fits here. I had a love/hate reaction to the main plot because it is hard to face the fact that something like this might actually be possible. In the first sections of the novel some of the details seemed to take a long time to develop, but ultimately I understand the reasons it was necessary. What sets this book apart for me are the vibrant characters and the clever plot threads. There is a really good villain called \\"Center\\" whose identity is kept well hidden and a computer nerd with almost rock star status. The good guys - Adam Yao, \\"Trash\\", and \\"Cheese\\" - along with returning friends from previous adventures feel so real it is hard to accept that they are fictional characters. This novel was a roller coaster thrill ride that kept me reading all day and far into the night. Clear some time and get ready for some pure entertainment before you begin reading this story. If you are like me, you will resent anything that interferes with your reading time.<br /><br />I received a complimentary copy of this novel for review purposes.

B008RC72G8|4.0|Since I grew up watching the original series, I was a bit reluctant to even watch this modern version, but have to admit, it wasn't a bad effort at all. I don't think it will ever become the icon that the series has, but it's quirky, interesting and funny at times, and Johnny Depp has proven once again that there really isn't any role that he can't do well. It was definitely worth watching - I enjoyed it!

0547884591|5.0|Ferriss lays down a methodical, funny, entertaining, and not to mention instructional take on learning how to cook.  The first two recipes, Osso Buko and Scrambled Eggs, immediately get you involved making tasty stuff to eat and encourage you to do more while beginning your familiarization with the kitchen.  I don't know if I will pursue becoming a professional chef, I do know that I'm going to eat better, healthier meals for less cash than I expected from now on.<br /><br />I've just started the slow-carb diet and this book's timing couldn't have been better as I tend to suffer from food boredom.  Now I have no excuse.  I\\"m going to work through this choose-your-own adventure volume at the pace set in the section marked \\"DOM\\" (for Domestic), and I'm pretty sure I'm going to wind up being all the better for it.  From there, who knows?  The learning techniques discussed could be applied to any field of knowledge and endeavor, I'm sure.

Very light fare but good to watch if you don't want to be bothered with trying to decide what to watch.

030758836X|5.0|Incredible, which refers to both the novel, and some of the reviews I've read.  Ms. Flynn's writing style and fascinating characters had me by the end of chapter one, and I wolfed it down within three days like a starving person!  It was an incredible read, and an imaginative storyline.<br /><br />Having said that, I'm perplexed by the flood of negative reviews surrounding the conclusion.  Ms. Flynn's main characters are complex and highly flawed, and therefore, a neatly-wrapped, fairy-tale ending would have been - in my opinion - disingenuous, and incompatible with the story.  Without giving too much away, I found the conclusion an inevitability.<br /><br />I would hope that readers who haven't yet discovered this wonderful book would not be dissuaded by some of the negative reviews.  The worth of any artful pursuit is naturally subjective, and that's as it should be.  All reviews carry equal weight whether positive or negative, of course.  But I would encourage you to try it for yourself as this is a novel that inspires strong emotions - and that's a very good thing.

B009NQKPUW|4.0|The quality is there across the board—Ridley Scott does an amazing job in his return to sci-fi—but maybe the story is at 90% of its potential. I think I read a review a couple weeks ago that sums Prometheus up nicely by saying it was great, but Ridley Scott could’ve taken it even farther. Definitely a good prequel to Alien.<br /><br />I love the human/alien history aspects of this movie—really makes you think about the other Alien movies and what causes what, where this thing came from, how that got started, etc. The creatures, costumes, sets, and locations are all amazing! It's much more cerebral than any of the Alien movies.<br /><br />Honestly, all my critiques are fairly minor. One thing that occurred to me afterward was that Prometheus is missing a creepy stalking scene: one of those classic scenes from the other Alien movies where these mysterious monsters are hunting/stalking the main characters in some darkly lit space. Most the creature stuff in Prometheus is fairly brief, with little buildup to the actual gore-fest. The ending (more specifically, the scenes with the old man) felt rushed, and I would’ve liked to have seen the last 30-45 minutes extended an additional 30.<br /><br />The main actors do a great job—very convincing. I'm a little annoyed by a couple of the supporting actors at the very end, when they decide to sacrifice themselves for the better good. Their characters aren't built up much, so it seems a bit too convenient for them to just up and decide to die. I was expecting a Private Hudson (Bill Paxton in Aliens) type moment where some character just freaks out and loses his shit … but that doesn't happen. In general, I would’ve liked to have seen a bit more realistic character buildup—crew members joking around and acting more believable.<br /><br />Overall, an excellent movie I would recommend seeing.

B008M34INW|4.0|I'm slightly annoyed that I wasn't able to finish this movie because my rental time ran out… I got about 80% through the movie, and from what I can tell, it's more or less a sequel to Payback. Not literally, but his character in this movie is nearly identical. I loved Payback.

B000VH4OCW|5.0|Here's Stevie at his best. This 1976 double album went to No. 1 on the charts and won the Album of the Year Grammy in 1977. Maybe nobody better combined pop riffs with social consciousness. Stevie Wonder also used the synthesizer with more versatility and taste than anyone else.The album kicks off with \\"Love's In Need of Love Today\\", a beautifully plaintive cry for more gentleness in a cruel world. \\"Village Ghetto Land\\" echoes George Harrison's \\"Little Piggies\\" on the Beatles' White Album with its combination of a Baroque theme and lyrics dripping with sarcasm. \\"Contusion\\" is a brilliantly complex yet catchy instrumental. \\"Sir Duke\\", a number 1 hit, is a joyful tribute to Duke Ellington. \\"I Wish\\" is the other No. 1 hit, a funky reminiscence of childhood bad behavior. \\"Isn't She Lovely\\", a song about his newborn daughter, has about as hooky a hook as is possible. \\"If It's Magic\\", backed only by a harp, with a short harmonica coda, is one of the most beautiful and poignant songs ever written. The MP3 package has four bonus tracks that apparently came on a single packaged with the original double album in some versions of the release, but not with the one I got back in the day. \\"Saturn\\" is wonderfully loopy song about going back to the planet Saturn, much like the BeeGees wanted to go back to Massachusetts even though they'd never been. \\"Packing my bags, going away to a place where the air is clean on Saturn...We don't fight our wars the way you do; we put back all the things we use on Saturn.\\" I wonder if this was influenced by jazz master-weirdo Sun Ra, who claimed to be from Saturn. \\"All Day Sucker\\" has a nice treat of a melody, and we close off with \\"Easy Goin' Evening\\", a well-named instrumental featuring the harmonica. I never picked up the CD version of this album and haven't played my vinyl in years, so it was really nice to relive this masterpiece on iTunes this fall.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|First, I'd like to say that Van Damme portrayed an excellent villain.  I was surprised.  But he never fights.  Why the hell would I want to see Van Damme simply strutting around as a charismatic bad guy?  Fight!!!  Fight Lundgren.  Fight Jet Li.  Fight Terry Crews.  I watch this movie to see legendary match-ups with choreographed brilliance.  In this flop, the great Van Damme fights Stallone at the end for about 2 minutes.  What the hell is that?<br /><br />Lundgren got a chance to shine as a thespian as well, his expressions priceless, BUT . . . who wrote the dialogue to this movie?  The gods of action are forced to spew the stupidest, inane, worthless, pointless phrases!!!!!  It degrades our American action legends!<br /><br />The young sniper is a blatant plot tool.  And he fires a sniper rifle faster than a double-action revolver.  Impossible.  Who advised this film?<br /><br />The guys barely fight all of the goons sent their way.  Instead there is a ton of gunfire.  Spraying and praying.  Why the hell do I want to see these action stars shooting guns the whole damn time?<br /><br />Remember that epic battle between Lundgren and Li in Expendables?  Remember that match between Stone Cold and Stallone?  Nothing like that in this film.  Jet Li is the best in this film, but he is in the film for a couple minutes kicking major butt creatively.  Then he literally jumps out of the film.  Statham has a nice scene as a priest, murdering a few guys.  Terry Crews throws a few goons around creatively.  But there is one villain of note, who never fights any of the other Expendables one-on-one.  What good is that?  Don't you want to see Statham vs. Van Damme?  Don't you want to see Li vs. Van Damme?  They really dropped the ball.  Hey, try paying a few famous MMA guys to be Van Damme's henchman and pit them one on one vs the Expendables!<br /><br />This film has a few exciting violent scenes.  It has too little hand-to-hand combat.  It is a bullet-fest.  If I wanted that, I could watch a million mediocre films with nobody actors.<br /><br />This is a collection of the gods of action, and all we get is a silly shoot-out with impossible shots made.  If I wanted magic, I'd watch Harry Potter.<br /><br />And please do not mention the ridiculous and corny Chuck Norris scenes.  He shows up for NO REASON, rescues them with magic bullet sprays and missile launches out of thin air, has corny music, NEVER FIGHTS ANYONE, and has dialogue that sounds barely more useful than a blast of diarrhea.<br /><br />I am so disappointed with Expendables 2.  I love these stars.  Each one of them.  I respect their skills, and I KNOW they can kick major butt creatively with great spectacle.  Instead, I got a POORLY WRITTEN, plot-less, bore with child-like dialogue.  The actors are obviously trying to be entertaining.  They succeed in their expressions, body language, etc.  But the script gave them a tasty heap of dung to speak and a paper-thin unreasonable plot that nobody cares about.<br /><br />How can these guys come from excellent movies like the Transporter series, the Rambo series, Predator, the Die Hard series, and so on--and YET accept this poorly-written poop-fest with guns???????<br /><br />Imagine Bruce Willis trying to take on Van Damme or a drunken Lundgren?  How cool would that be to see?  Imagine Arnold and Stallone duking it out over some plot twist?  How awesome would that be?  Imagine Jet Li and Statham teaming up vs. a ton of guys.  How about Terry Crews brawling against Van Damme?  How about Chuck Norris fighting his way out of a paper bag, if he still can?<br /><br />We get none of that.  We get a glorified day at the gun range.  So, I swallow my love for these legends, and declare Expendables 2 barely mediocre entertainment.  And it hurts to say that.  The first one is way better than this one.  Van Damme was wasted.  All the talent was wasted.<br /><br />Expendables 3 now looks like a bad fart on the horizon.

0547884591|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Tim Ferriss, though I am ashamed to admit I haven't finished The Four Hour Body or finished The Four Hour Work Week!! I pre-ordered The Four Hour Chef and happily started reading it upon arrival. I am BEYOND impressed with the time and quality that has gone into this book.<br /><br />I am so pleased to learn much more than just \\"how to cook.\\" I already have decent cooking skills from going Paleo a year ago (though my presentation is atrocious).<br /><br />I never thought I'd purchase a book on learning how to learn :)
B008S7EPXA|5.0|i've been a fan of this music for over a dozen years...just heard this music on Echoes and bought tonight...great atmospheric new age-y stuff again...
B005K0HDGE|4.0|It's a great book.  I read it an now I'm listening to it and catching a lot that I missed the first time.  My only criticism is that it really is too long.  How much detail do we really need to know about the school play?
B00A17AD36|5.0|I love this album, it's soft, slow and sensual. It's not the old style R&B, but it has the deepness to it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read every Vince Flynn book that he has written I you like clanstine sevice and black ops stories Vince Fylnn is the best at it. He has developed a charater Mich Rapp and his career in the CIA after reading you get the feeling Mich Rapp is real and just not a charater generated by Vince.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Jamie Foxx/Tom Cruise work well together in this flick. Didn't bother getting Blu-Ray, i didnt need to with this one.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Great graphics! lots of different things to find and figure out how to use them. Couldn't put it down!! One of the better games of this type that I have played. Works great on my Kindle Fire.
B00936A0RU|4.0|Arrived quick with no damage to packaging. Tom hardy was excellent! i i i i i i i i i
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is.fun and you will get bored.of it very fast because I guess it has one.hundred and one (101) games but they are all boring
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I am only a little more than half way through it but it is remarkable how he is able to describe his experiences and bring them to life. He is very believable because of who he is and his knowledge of the brain.
B009JBZH54|1.0|i already bought the first two dvds with all the extras for $5 bucks each. In less than 5 months TDKR blu ray will be like 14 bucks. Any  \\"new\\" extras can be seen on youtube.
0547884591|5.0|I've only read about how to make arugula spaghetti, bacon burbon, and why letting cooked meat rest is important.  Yet I still give this a 5* because I've applied the little I've learned to meals + snacks for the family (substitute arugula with bread dough + fry) and everyone loves it.  My wife who doubted and hated on my book purchase has stolen my copy and reading it for herself.<br /><br />I've purchased the 4 hour body and 4 hour work week, and this one is a two way tie for my fav 4 hour book since lessons can be applied immediately.<br /><br />Definitely recommend this if you are a closet foodie, food curious, or an open foodie.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I like this book because I'm almost in middle school and if that happens well then I'm in for a big surprise
B007WKEM8C|5.0|This book is so pretty!!!  The recipes are delicous and the photography is beautiful.  I've loved each and every recipe I've tried!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! Totally addicted. But it glitches occasionally.... only thing I don't like about it....<br />Other than that, its great!
B0080R7Q70|5.0|The strongest TFK abum in a years. I almost lost my fate it TFK, but this brings it all back!
B006CEYM3Y|5.0|Stefan Feld is one of my favorite designers, and here he delivers another masterpiece.  The fantastic \\"mancala\\" style mechanism is really the heart and soul of the game.  It's as innovative and interesting as the wind rose from Macao, but completely different.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the number of actions and ways to score that this mandates forces a very convoluted euro with a disjointed theme.  So, if you love euro games, this is a gem, but if your idea of board games doesn't go past Monopoly or Clue, you should get your feet wet with other games first (Ticket to Ride maybe?)<br /><br />It's GREAT but not for everyone.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|This was a lot like a lot of other movies. Quirky outsider kids, absurd grown-ups. Much like the Royal Tenenbaums or Life Aquatic. Other Wes Anderson movies are better. That isn't to say this was awful, and I watched the whole thing instead of turning it off, it just wasn't anything special.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I am so thrilled about this book!!! I really never read anything like it before except the Percy Jackson series!!! Also, I recommend that you read the Percy Jackson series BEFORE you read the Heroes of Olympus series!!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I enjoy the two different.worlds in this book how his effects hers and how her effects his . They are a pair
B009MB682W|2.0|One would think that mistakes would breed learning. I've heard the arguments - \\"they never release the new one in the new DVD or CD compilations\\". Well, they don't chart anymore, either. This is idiocy. I would have bought the new compilation just to get the Adele song, but that wasn't an option. So, I'll become less and less interested. Stupid.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|if you have a bunch of math homework with this app you'll be surprised on how fast your done.its great!!!!
B004EPYZV2|5.0|I like the next version and it still leaves me wanting more. I am glad that they are still keeping to the idea of the old MI story from TV.
0761171703|5.0|There are so many amazing shots in this book! It would be an incredible addition to your coffee table - you won't want to put this one down. I'm so glad I pre-ordered this one.<br /><br />Plus the stories of how some of the shots were taken at the back are such a fun surprise!
0547884591|5.0|Tim has done it again.  This book is another gem.  I bought it just for the meta-learning and I'm loving it.  As a vegetarian, there's a bit too much meat in the book for my taste - though many of the cooking techniques and ideas are still applicable.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I listen to this album quite a bit.  What's funny is that my 6-year old son and 2-year old daughter request to listen to this, specifically the &#34;Peponi&#34; and &#34;Star Wars&#34; tracks.  This album ALWAYS puts my son in a good mood.  He puts on headphones and listens to the star wars track nonstop and dances around.  It is awesome!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|It made me wonder who actually wrote this book! It didn't feel like a Scarpetta story! I was disappointed in it!
0062014102|5.0|This is by far my favorite book. This is the story of the limitless possibilities of human potential. The idea in and of itself blows my mind and even though it's just a theory, it's a beautiful one and one i seem to experience in my everyday life. This is a book i read once a year because it never ceases to show me new things.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I loved Sigh No More, and counted the days to the release of this new album.  I couldn't imagine that it could be as good as their first. Well, it is not as good...it is BETTER!  At least for me, it is lyrically superior to Sigh No More.  The songs seem to have deeper meaning and more spiritual depth. It is an amazing set of songs and I don't see how anyone could be disappointed.

B0009IOR6Q|5.0|I love it!!! Cry Baby is my favorite movie!!! Going to buy it for my sister! I would totally recommend to everyone! Johnny Depp is so cute in this movie!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|fun fun this game is so incredibly fun! thanx rovio again. fun fun fun bad piggies rock! fun fun fun!
B0074VTHKM|5.0|Great book overall!<br />However, a little pricey.<br />This book is a part of a great series and I am looking forward to the next book.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|Omg I love this movie so much. Always have and always will.  The story line is superb and this is a movie for the ages.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Even if  your not a fan of the zombie genre you'll enjoy this book.  Its an interesting take on the zombie apocalypse, that takes you from the beginning to (Suprisingly.) after the apocalypse.  Most zombie books cover before and during, but this was the first to actually have a post-apocalyptic view.  Max Brooks' writing is well done and shows the amount of research he did.  I have read it multiple times and look forward to doing so again.
B007T99ENE|4.0|The beginning really got me in and kept me interested until about 3/4 through.  I started to lose interest but as I was so close to the end I kept with it, and it really paid off!<br /><br />I'll let you find out, read it you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Enjoy
1451696191|5.0|There are so many things to say about The Perks of Being a Wallflower; I'll limit my observations.<br /><br />The characters are eerily believable. I think I've met a few of them in my lifetime. I identified with and felt alienated from the character of Charlie. The complexities of his mind fascinated me. His thoughts on the books he reads and the music he listens to are reflections of someone growing, learning and trying to \\"participate\\" in life, even when he doesn't really want to.<br /><br />The story unfolds at a rapid pace and you become so wrapped up in the unfolding that when the climax reveals the plot you're shocked. To call it brilliant is extreme; superbly crafted is an apt description. The emotions of teenagers faced with the real world too soon are laid bare.<br /><br />I'll be first to say it isn't for everyone. \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower has been included on the American Library Association's annual '10 Most Frequently Challenged Books' list five times in the past ten years.\\" Though I don't agree with censorship, I do understand why some wouldn't want their children to read this unfiltered and raw work of fiction.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|Loved the movie! Loved the whole saga!!! Definately glad I have the movies so I can watch them anytime, especially since the saga is over now
0547884591|5.0|Learning in the 4- Hour Chef has given new perspective to food and life. Glad to support the work and contribution of insight and skill delivered to reader's via the insightful mind of T. Ferriss. Read it.
B009HELT3C|5.0|We rented this for family night and it was a hit with my wife and I plus kids. I didn't think it would be that good but it is.
B008S847X2|5.0|Another masterwork from the master. This record shines and blasts through the stratosphere in a summary statement of a brilliant man's lifework. There are hints of mahavishnu, india, miles, coltrane and especially one truth. All his music is outstanding however every few years he brings out a special one. This is it! Check it out. Glimpses of the beyond are audible (!).
B00785P2QC|5.0|I think you should make it easier to make money. Other than that I like it. Thank you for letting me play this game
B009NQKPUW|5.0|If you loved the Alien movies, you'll love this prequel.<br />The movie is good (4 stars) on its own, but add the fact it is the prequel, it soars.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|What a fun book. The title first attracted me and then I was sold. This adventure takes you all over the world where we meet some amazing and funny characters. The book tells of the 100 year old's adventures then flashes back to his life before he escaped the nursing home. Get drunk with a president, save Mao's girlfriend and make Stalin mad at you. Befriend a woman with a pet elephant and escape to the tropics. Everyone will enjoy this book.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Great complex plot gets a hurried and unrealistic ending. Amazing discussions about relationships and it is written in a fun format, but I'm disappointed in the conclusion!
B0038KSEVQ|2.0|Meh.  Didn't like it and it really didn't make much sense.  Just pointless.  Had quite a lot of symbolism though.
B009A9EQL6|4.0|Love Aerosmith so anything they do.... I'm in!  Enjoyed this CD.  Will always follow what they do as I have been a fan for a long time.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|My zombie background is limited to Shaun of the Dead and The Walking Dead, both of which I really enjoy. This book is episodic, but works in a way that a mere collection of short stories would not. The different approaches to dealing with the discovery of the unlikely problem the response, and the recovery was quite fascinating. I'm hesitant to read other zombie fiction because this was just so captivating. I don't think the movie can possibly do it justice; a series featuring a different perspective each episode would be more likely to do so. If you are looking for a book that is more of a thoughtful approach than a shot 'me up, this is for you.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I've loved all the soundtracks from all the movies and this one doesn't disappoint! I would recommend this one too!
B001T3RA8M|5.0|I remember being about nine or so and being faced with the choice of Sabriel or another book at the bookstore. At the time I chose the other book. Years later my middle school library stocked Lirael and since I had run through the rest of their books I picked it up on a whim. I devoured it and desperately searched for more by the same author. I remember the jolt of recognition seeing the cover and feeling regret I hadn't chose Sabriel originally.<br /><br />Sabriel is not a girl who waits around to be saved. When her father goes missing and she receives a cryptic gift she doesn't hesitate to go after him. The balance of emotion in the book is pretty darn perfect. There are small moments of peace in between all the danger and adventure and a wonderfully understated romantic subplot. I definitely would recommend it to any fan of fantasy.
B004SB60OC|5.0|I got this for my sister as a bridal shower gift and she loved it! It arrived quickly and it was brand new. :)
0547884591|5.0|Stunning photos, beautifully designed and extremely well written. Tim Ferriss really can do it all, and maybe now I can too.
1400049628|5.0|I bought this as a joke and the fact that I love zombies :P The author goes about the material in such a serious way that makes it even more hilarious. But the survival tips given are actually quite logical and make sense. I would recommend it to any zombie fan :)
B000WGZGNS|5.0|This concert is awe-inspiring from start to finish. Beyonce's vocals are strong as are her dance moves and her supporting dancers and her all-female band prove that they deserve just as much praise for their performances as Beyonce does. They way she set this concert up truly makes it an experience worth having.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Shipped quickly and arrived quickly. I was very satisfied with this product :) Brand new and still in the wrap. No damage and it plays great :D
B009LUBA7M|5.0|I heard about Mika before, but I was never really interested in his work until this album. The Origin of Love is just an amazing album, lyrical depth met with fun music makes for an album that will ringing in my ears for a very long time.
0767834739|5.0|This is definitely worth it. It was a great price and I was very satisfied with my purchase :) It comes with a slip cover and all the special features. Perfect for any Resident Evil fan :D
B004NOCCEG|5.0|I bought and watched this movie through amazon prime-I loved both the structure (story flow) and substance of this documentary film. Greatly appreciated.<br />Plan to watch it again and look forward to seeing films like this more. Greatly appreciated.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I bought this after only hearing Born To Die, Video Games, and Off To The Races. Lana brings an angelic voice, beauty that is unmatched, and gorgeous music that is deeply touching and comes from the heart. Her voice trumps every other singer of today! I love every song on the album and I would definitely recommend it. Lana brings hope and talent back to the music industry, I absolutely love her &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3
B006ZS4G24|1.0|I am disgusted at the price of this item. They should be ashamed. This product sells for around 25 dollars even on at the Lego store.  You are taking advantage of consumers just trying to make their kid happy for Christmas. Absolutely ridiculous!  I'm sure the quality is fantastic like other Lego products, but at this price, I don't even want to buy it!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I think this is thebest version of solitaire that I've ever played.  The game loads quickly and I've never had any kind of problem with it.  The best thing is I can win!
B005H9B44A|2.0|Nothing was really exceptional in this movie. I'd write a long review, but I already feel like I've wasted enough of my life by watching it.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I love my cloud storage and player. I have bought many mp3 downloads from several media services and have lost all my money when my phone or mp3 player was lost or broken. But with my Amazon digital purchases they are stored free on my cloud and I can get them anytime anywhere and play them on the web. I dont feel like Im wasting my money because I will always have the music I bought and even other music downloads that I already had on my computer because I can import the songs I didnt buy from Amazon. I even get free songs from Amazon that I didnt ask for and its music I love. Its great to know my jams are safe and secure and will always be there when I want it. Thanks Amazon Digital.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Who doesn't love AMC's The Walking Dead?  The BluRay/DVDs are what I expected them to be... Simply Amazing!  This collectors edition case is downright amazing too.  It's like we've got the RV walker in our own home (except the RV walkers head is about 80% the size of a regular human head)!  My kids refuse to be in the same room with it, so that's kind of funny.  It's good to put on display when we have company, a real conversation piece!  The screw driver in the eye pops the head up so you can access the disks inside.  Other than that, not real sure what else I can say about this.  It's scary, and it's awesome!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Very comforting for me and I usually can't sleep easily, so that's a huge plus. Choosing my own sounds with each element at its own volume that makes me happy. And it's FREE! JUST LOVE!!!
0547884591|5.0|Tying knots, knife skills, food pairings, booze, deserts, urban survival what more could you ask for<br /><br />Definitely worth the read.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|It look cute at first when I installed it. But then I noticed there is an air pocket between the phone and the case making it really bad to hear. The voice is muffled and you can't text properly. There is a delay. I wouldn't buy nor recommend this product. It's great to protect ur phone from water but that is all!
B008XG1X18|3.0|It's hard to see anything but the boards you're subscribed to.  I use Pinterest mostly so that I can save things I want to go back and look at later; recipes, DIY, etc.  And it's hard to pull up your own pins if you're, for example, in the store purchasing the ingredients to a recipe you pinned.  It's also limited on how much will load all at once.
0930289234|5.0|Reviewing this 25 years after it came out, after the movie and after over 1,000 others here have opined, I realize there is little truly new I can add. I'm nearly 50. I've got kids in their 20s. I read comic books in the early to mid 1970s (3rd-6th grade) before moving onto Doc Savage pulp fiction, science fiction, and then novels. I'm someone who loves Graham Greene, George Orwell, Kingsley Amis, Anthony Burgess, and William S. Burroughs. But I also greatly appreciate Philip K. Dick, Neal Stephenson, Stephen King, and William Gibson. I've already seen the movie. I'd never read a graphic novel before. I saw this on sale recently and decided to read my first graphic novel. Was I impressed. All I can tell others who may be like me is to...read this! Read it once thru for fun. Then read it again slowly, savoring the drawings, the colors. Appreciate the stories within the story. The interludes.<br /><br />While it is fully illustrated, making it \\"graphic\\" (and much of the subject matter is too, involving rape, murder, vigilantes, law & order, politics, communism/capitalism, decadence & decay, racism, and more), it truly is \\"a novel\\", in the fullest modern sense. There is an amazing story here with wonderful characters and ideas that make you think deeply. That is what any good novel should do. This work swallows you into its world, which is both highly developed and fully believable, and never lets you go. You suspend any sense of disbelief and...lose yourself in the characters and plot. And you begin a most fascinating journey of discovery.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead is a thrilling, edge of your seat kind of series. Love it! Would recommend to all my friends!
B000GWE44U|5.0|I am a psych student and had to watch  One Flew Over the Cukoo Nest for a class this was suggested to purchase and I did.  I love old movies and this was a great depiction of mental health.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I was on level 25 and I went to my home screen and played a different game when I went back to subway surfers my level was 1 and I was so angry after playing this game for so long.
B0053O89KG|5.0|awesome sincerely hope this show has a long run hated when they cancelled firefly  the cast work great together  wonderful show
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very Interesting and an easy read. Although I need no convincing, I found his experience to be well documented and believable.
B0038YWPZS|5.0|If you have someone who can't get enough of Dirty Dancing and Patrick Swayze, this is a great keepsake. My Mom loved this gift!
B0058O84G0|2.0|Having read a few of Ken Follett's books I think I have become to familiar with his writing style. The characters are transparent & the storyline is predictable. There is an underlying simplistic view of the events surrounding World World one while parts of it are enjoyable, it is somewhat drawn out.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy playing this game probably too much because I spend an awful lot of time engrossed in it. But it's a great stress relievers and helps pass the time if you're waiting for an appointment etc.
B000K4WLXA|5.0|If you're a fan of Final Fantasy VII. This this is something that you should have in your collection. Pure Awesome. ^__^
B002OR18HQ|3.0|About 80% of the dvd was new music which was not I believe up to John's level. In the latter section he brought his sons out and performed a trio of lead guitarists which was great. The show did end with John's classics. Its satisfactory but not quite what I had expected.
B0054JELS4|5.0|I would highly recommend this seller.  The articles arrived promptly an included a nice surprise, the ninth season was included. Since this is a Christmas gift, the items have not been viewed but the condition of the outside case is in excellent condition.
0061474355|5.0|Nix's Old Kingdom comes alive around you as the story of Sabriel unfolds.  The basics are all there, a girl with a destiny to save the world emerges as the hero, the boy who remembers nothing, and an evil force that threatens to destroy the world.  However, the story is woven so well, the world so immersive, that you find yourself unable to put this story down.<br /><br />Forget Twilight.<br />Forget Harry Potter.<br />Forget the idea of \\"teen fantasy\\"<br /><br />This is Sabriel.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Another good but not great Follett page turner. A lot more politics than his other books and at times a little heavy -handed. The bad guys are sooo bad, the good guys soooo good. Still a good read and Follett remains one of my favorite contemporary authors.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I loved this album!! It has a fresh sound. The harmonies in it are wonderful and the melodies haunting. I could listen to it for hours. One of the best music choices I've made!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Chess can be time-consuming. With this app I can practice whenever I have a spare minute and I don't have to try to find someone to play with. Also, I'm not worried if I loose because--c'mon!--I'm playing a computer. (And getting better.)
B005R32L66|4.0|best free way to face to face & link all my friends from email multiple that i am aware of just adding my kids now makes it better.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|Good book. Recommended if you like war themes. Not as good to be a best seller, but well, the prologue was well written.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|The Dark Knight Rises is a good movie, but I have no idea why we want digital copy without being able to use in iTunes.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Hi,<br /><br />I'm always impressed with Amazon's online buying! Easy to use website, delivery usually ahead of schedule and great follow-up!<br />Keep up the great job! I always recommend Amazon to friends.
B00AA7O22U|1.0|You get all these big time actors and the interaction is so lame. It's like they blew the budget on the actors and had no money left for the script.
B007HACDLK|4.0|This Mitch Rapp adventure is fast moving and a great follow up to the last book. can't wait for next.
0547884591|5.0|This book takes snapshots of life and breaks them down with a focus on efficiency and success.  Follow the man's path in the kitchen and the world becomes brighter and more vivid.  Great investment.  Great gift for the holidays.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|Loved the premis of the book but I felt it was not one of King's better works. It was fun to relive that bit of history from another perspective. I would recommend the book but it's not a Talisman.
B0011WL8MK|5.0|I have both this one now and the Mel Brooks remake. They are both worth having if you are a fan of either one or Mel Brooks. The DVD was good quality. The stories are similar with some changes like the main characters names. Watching both gave me a more full understanding of the whole story.
B008XCPO2Q|5.0|Not the greatest plot but hot guys taking off their clothes - what's not to love?? Channing Tatum doesn't disappoint!! HOTTTTTT!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Love this book - John Grisham holds me in the palm of his hand with each and every book he writes.  Someday I hope to have every one of his books in my library.
B000VDDDVO|4.0|Just today I received my copies of [[ASIN:B000VDDDVO It's A Wonderful Life (Two-Disc Collector's Set)]]  (UPC 097361313849).<br /><br />This is the DVD set (and not the Blu-ray set) that includes both the B&W and Colorized versions of the movie.  I haven't opened my set yet because I am disappointed that it DIDN'T come with the Collectible O-Sleeve Artwork as shown in the product picture on Amazon - AND as described as being included with this DVD set (see \\"Special Features\\" of the product listing). The Collectible O-Sleeve is usually a cardboard-type envelope or slipcover that slides over the DVD case.<br /><br />This DVD set, as it appears in the product listing photo, shows the Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed characters framed within a circle.  I DIDN'T receive that!. I don't know why this happened.  I am a collector so I feel let down and may return it for either a refund or replacement.  Have to rate the movie 4 stars due to the fact that the product that was shipped to me is NOT the same one as shown and described in the Amazon listing for this particular DVD edition.<br /><br />Would love to hear from other recent purchasers of this particular \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" edition to hear if they received the Collectible O-Sleeve Artwork or not.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Overall, I really enjoyed this book.  I am glad I picked up the Omnibus Edition, because I cannot imagine it to be satisfying reading any of the five segments as stand-alone novellas.  I thought the ending was good and now understand that it wasn't the end, the sixth and seventh parts already being released.  I probably won't read them just to stay satisfied.  Crazy, huh?<br /><br />In writing it this way, I think one of the interesting things about the book was likely unintentional:  you thought you had a protagonist but didn't -- twice, at least until the middle of the story.  The main character,  unfortunately, was the stairs.  You'd have thought the fictional designers of the elaborate self-contained setting featuring almost 200 levels and an IT section would have thought about something as ingenious as elevators.  This would have been convenient to the characters as well as the reader.
0857680986|5.0|This is my most treasured drawing book and hands down the best on figure drawing there is. I've dropped plenty of coin on online figure drawing courses and anatomy books, but I'd trade every bit of it for this one book. Andrew Loomis is the master and an excellent instructor. Just reading the first few pages you will be inspired to improve and stick with it.<br /><br />I've had a poor-quality PDF of the original printing for several years, but it's SO much better now having a hardcover. For one, it's oversized, which is much easier to read and study Loomis's sketches. Two, having full spreads of the pages is much easier to absorb and work from.<br /><br />I also have Loomis's [[ASIN:0857680978 Drawing the Head and Hands]], which is equally good, but this one is the essential.
B009NQKXYK|1.0|This movie is a straight rip off of the &#34;Aliens&#34; trilogy in the late 80's. There is the robot, the big company that puts profit ahead of lives, and the evil aliens that invest the humans. The plot is weak, the characters are trite, the entire movie is forgettable. It would have been a waste to see this movie in the theatre and even a waste to rent it. Very disappointing!
1451627297|5.0|Wonderful book.  I stopped reading Stephen King after Cujo.  His work was too graphic and too filled with horrible images.  A friend told me about this book, so I took a chance.  Beautifully written, great idea...what would happen if we could go back in time and stop the assassination of JFK?  I won't tell you what it is about, but I haven't given anything away since you are told this premise from the beginning.  Interesting journey....I loved this book
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|amazing<br />This book is so cool<br />Love this book<br />It is sooooo funny<br />Bacon is so tasysty<br />Peace out man

B0076DELIG|3.0|This is a substandard entry in the Harry Bosch series. The characters are OK, but the plot is poor, especially the ending. I won't give away details, but Bosch is rescued from big trouble by another cop. But the rescuer's presence is inexplicable and is never explained. Of course, you can't let Bosch get killed. But the ending as written is pretty lame. There are other events, too, which don't make sense.  There's a lot of extraneous material, like jazz trivia. His teenage daughter doesn't sound like a teenager; she sounds like his middle-aged girlfriend. But she's a good shot.<br /><br />Bosch is getting pretty old for this kind of work. He was present as a uniformed patrol officer at the SLA siege in 1974. So he must be over 60, with more than 35 years on the force. He also seems to hate the LAPD, at least its management. Maybe he should retire and write his memoirs.

B004H0M8EA|5.0|This should be required reading for politicians. It is a bit depressing but a clear picture of the disasters facing us unless we take action on climate change, population control and the dangers of fossils fuels, deforestation and mining. I plan to write a synopsis to circulate to friends to encourage them to read it and take action. If you have kids or grandkids you need to read this.
B000FBH3XQ|5.0|These recordings were made some years ago.  Still, the clarity, color and balance are superb.  These are exciting works, which I had not yet discovered until hearing these discs.  They rate, suddenly, among my top five favorite classical recordings.  Every music lover should discover these joyful works, and learn the interesting background to them.
080701429X|5.0|I needed this book for my college leadership class not knowing what the book was about. Once I started it I could not put it down, the author does a great job describing the environment and mindset of the prisoners. It flips your world and you will love it.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|The twitter app works well. I like it. It was different to learn from the iPhone to the Kindle but thats nobodies fault. It works just as well as any other twitter app out there. Everything is placed a little different but that doesnt bother me at all.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this next book in the hunger games trilogy. And it leaves you in suspense for the next book!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Like, The 4-Hour Work Week, this book offers a lot of great info, great jumping off points for someone wanting to make changes in their life, or just learn some new things.  If you've been interested in cooking, this is a great starting point and the simple recipes and beautiful pictures will motivate you to get going.  If you tend to look at books like this as an all or nothing proposition, don't.  Take what you can use and start thinking about what else you might like to learn or do.  The best thing about Ferris' books is that they are motivating and a great reminder that you don't have to be stuck anywhere in life.  I will probably never start an internet business or dress a deer, but what Ferris accomplishes with his books, in my opinion, is to remind you that if you wanted to, you could do those things!  I've made one recipe so far but even if I didn't make another, it was well worth the price.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book.  I couldn't turn it down.  I can't wait for the movie.  I would recommend it to everyone.

B0086700CM|1.0|Love the game. But I can barely play it as it's choppy and lags and won't respond to my finger. Boo. Fix these issues and I won't have any problems.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very addicting. Could put the book down. I liked that it was a book for young adults that didn't focus on a love story.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|This was head and shoulders above the &#34;Pigs&#34; game which came out earlier.  Admit I've become addicted to Angry Birds and wife thinks I'm nuts.<br /><br />One thing about this game is that you never know what you're up against.  Some screens you can hit three stars on the very first try, while others seem next to impossible to figure out.  Otherwise great fun.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|i will be honest. i am well over the age to enjoy this game and tv show but i do love it!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|!  Having seen &#34;Pride&Prejudice&#34;Many times before by various different actors ,including Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle(whom I adored)this version with lovely Keira Knightley and Matthew McFayden its sublime,she's the face of innocense,loveliness and beauty.McFayden plays the romantic hero to perfeccion.Miss Austen has once more given me inmense pleasure.

1451695195|5.0|MY husband and I had just started a course  called AFTER LIFE. Our teacher was very familar with Mr Alexander, and had read the book. It was like having two teachers. Our professor gave us a historical prospective of the various beliefs over the centuries, but ultimately let us decide for ourselves. Most of in the class experienced a NDE in our lives. I thought the book helped me to understand my experience and added another voice in our class.

B009E3EXMU|5.0|Long-awaited. The only bad thing I can say about this release, is that it brings to light how little Zeppelin has released from their vaults. You know they have a ton of stuff (studio outtakes, alternate versions, never heard tunes) waiting.<br /><br />The guys sound as great as one could expect. John Bonham's son does a stellar job filling in. Can't imagine what it would have been like to have been there for this. Glad they made it available to everyone in a permanent fashion!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Good app, not great. Cannot change the color of the clock. Even in the Paid version. Please fix.<br />Landscape mode is great
B002VPE1WK|4.0|First impressions after two weeks:<br /><br />Fits the gear I needed to pack:<br /><br />Main compartment<br /> -Rebel Xsi with EF-S 15-85mm lens attached<br /> -EF-400mm f/5.6 lens in case<br /> -Tamron 70-300mm lens<br /> -EF-S 18-55mm lens<br /> -Nikon Monarch 3 binoculars<br /><br />Main compartment accessory pockets<br /> -Lens filters<br /> -Mini table tripod<br /> -Canon battery charger<br /> -Cleaning stuff<br /> -Cables<br /> -SD cards<br /> -A lot of other stuff<br /><br />Outside compartment<br /> -HP Pavilion dm1 11\\" laptop in neoprene sleeve (cord in main compartment)<br /><br />This is packed to capacity. You can see the square shape of the laptop when packed this tight.<br /><br />Very compact and lightweight. Hip belt seems useful.<br /><br />My main concern at this point is build quality. I'm already starting to see some evidence of minor thread tearing and seam stretching. We'll see how it holds up over the long term. Other issue are the silly rubber zippers with flashy Amazon logos. I was able to shave off the \\"steal me please\\" logos with a razor blade, but I suspect the rubber is going to eventually fail and make using the zippers frustrating.<br /><br />As far as I can tell this is nearly the exact same design as the Canon 200EG backpack. At some point I'm curious to compare the build quality. If Canon is more sturdy it would be worth the extra 10 bucks.<br /><br />Assuming that it doesn't disintegrate in the next month I'd recommend this product. It's a fraction the cost of the other \\"name brand\\" options and (more importantly) has much less outward sex appeal when traveling in foreign countries.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|its a great  app its very enjoyable  Its fun because you can do it for along time and still enjoy it I really like how there is so many birds also.Its %100 a ***** star app!

B004SIP6A4|4.0|Chicago is a terrific adaptation of the Broadway musical that boasts a spectacular cast and dazzling musical numbers. The entire cast is on point here. I'm typically not a fan of Renee Zellweger but I found myself thoroughly enjoying her performance in the film. Zeta-Jones, Gere, and surprisingly Reilly are equally enjoyable and have musical chops of which I had no idea existed. If you're a fan of musicals or films set in the 20s, you'll more than likely enjoy this movie.
1400067820|5.0|The third of Taleb's books is arguably his most important, erudite and useful. The book is worth the read just to observe the ruthless swiftness with which Taleb takes his unique ideas on an eclectic mix of historical and arcane subjects and transforms them to practical advice that will help you with everything from dealing with your boss, diet, exercise, and avoiding the hazard that is the medical establishment.<br /><br />Taleb is clearly a man with an obsessive ethical commitment. Yet what is interesting about the reaction to this book is the number of people (mainly academics) who brand Taleb an egomaniac. Any fair reading of the book shows that this cannot be the case. For egomania, one should look at the heaps of charlatans, professionals and academics using their credentials to enforce policies that alter the lives of millions negatively. Taleb, on the other hand, sits in his library and doesn't attempt to enforce anything on anybody; he only offers negative advice (what not to do) and experiments with his ideas on himself and reports to his readers. He also uses his intellect to calmly and comprehensively destroy the pretenses of these charlatans--he tells it like it is, and it isn't pretty, but that's hardly his fault. Far more often than not, Taleb's advice turns out much better than that of the armies of charlatans he disparages. These charlatans, on the other hand, continue to be paraded around media and polite society as if they were a gift of wisdom to humanity. It isn't egomania for Taleb to use his books to set the record straight on these charlatans. This is courage in an era where the majority cheer naked emperors. In fact, those who charge him with egomania illustrate that they cannot engage the ideas themselves and resort to caricaturing the messenger so they do not have to deal with the uncomfortable reality that much of what they learned in college is worthless. These critics, ironically enough, confirm one of Taleb's famous aphorisms: You onlywin an argument when they attack your person.
B0021L8V0W|3.0|Salt entertains but doesn't do much else. Jolie gives a good performance but beyond that, the plot is predictable and preposterous. There's some good action scenes to be had but the film doesn't have a high rewatch value.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I just got into American Horror Story and plowed through Season 1 (Murder House) and then realized that on demand had already purged episodes 1-3 of Asylum.  I've never bought an episode of anything before but I just HAD to catch up so that I could watch the unfolding madness.  I love watching many of the actors returning for different roles - Lange and Quinto in particular are just amazing.  If you like quirky, sadistic, sexy fun times, give it a watch.

B00095NX9G|4.0|I LOVE this video - not for beginners though. It's quite challenging and very well rounded. As many people have said, the music isn't great. Kinda circusy. However, once you learn the skills, use them with whatever music you choose!

0547884591|5.0|I have been a big fan of Tim Ferriss' books since Four Hour Workweek. He has a great perspective on how to view the working world or how to approach any new subject. The Four Hour Chef will not disappoint. At first glance, yeah its a cookbook. But, the step-by-step process on how to minimize the learning curve is a great time saver and tool for approaching any new skill. The titled example of \\"The 4-Hour Chef\\" is only a brief glimpse at the life skills you can learn from this huge book. Great value, lots of great stuff!

B0073LWEXK|5.0|Has great graphics and logical puzzles to accompany them. Unlike other puzzle games, with enough thought and exploration, you can solve this game without hints. Only gripe, it's too short. I got addicted and beat it in a few hours, but well worth a dollar time killer.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Intriguing and creepy; this show keeps me coming back for more.  Very entertaining, I highly recommend it.  Jessica Lange is amazing in her role as St. Jude.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|best game ever I had been waiting for it to come on the kindle I had to use my moms phone just to play it would be better if it had its cheats still it is beast
B002YCVX5S|4.0|I go into a lot of places where you have people coming in and seling bootleg copies of movies for about $5. You know when you buy these items you are doing an injustice to yourself, and are actually comitting a crime, but more than that you take away monies from people who worked to create the product and that just isn't right... SO DONT' BUY BOOTLEG COPIES, let the people who work to create movies get paid for thier work.
0547884591|5.0|I waited anxiously for this book, and was very satisfied with how it turned out. Ferriss has outdone himself here. Each of the sections of this book were useful in their own way, and I intend to apply much of it (especially the meta learning) to my own life. The recipes in the book are also excellent. I'm going to try and cook as many of them as I can in the coming months.  Of the four cooking sections, Wild was my favorite. I'm a hunter from small town Idaho, so I felt at home in those chapters, and got some excellent ideas.  I wrote an in depth review of the book that you can check out if you want, here is the link:[...] Check it out if you want to do a little more research before buying the book.  In short, I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone. I have yet to meet a person who wouldn't want to be a better cook or learn faster, and this book will allow you to do both.

B001RIY4WE|5.0|Good Movie - Excellent Transfer to Blu-ray. It's a must own for your collection! Buy IT you wont be disappointed
B003P2WO5E|5.0|An instant classic with a favoured spot on my bookshelf.<br />It rates right up there with Tolkien & Roberts in terms of offering a new fantasy world for readers to immerse themselves in.<br /><br />Does tend to go a bit overboard with the extensiveness of descriptions, since it's the first book in the series it can be a lot to take in at once.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This series is fantastic, getting it on Blu-ray was something I'd been looking forward to, and at this price, it's impossible to pass up.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|I was a bit skeptical at first when I bought this album for the first time since it is a genre I was not very used to. However I can say that this is one of the best $7 purchases for an album in quite some time. Every song has great replay value, and was worth the money put into it. I'm a trail hiker so music to me is essential when scaling a mountain, but this album makes me feel like a spartan! Honestly in the beginning some of them sound the same, but the more you listen to them the more that you will fall in love with them!
030759565X|5.0|This is the most beautiful cookbook ever! The recipes are wonderful and differ from the ones on the blog. Great photos!

B0050R0YB8|5.0|This kit is awesome, I got 2.  One for me and one for later resale.  Got them for $320 each at this price its a great deal.  If you have to pay the $400 full retail price your not getting a good deal but once you put it together you wan't mind the price.<br /><br />I pick this thing up and fly it around my house and it stays together quite well if you hold it in the right places.
0062060562|3.0|\\"Before I Go to Sleep,\\" is that rare best-selling debut novel, a British mystery/thriller, victim of amnesia/ female in danger department, by S.J. Watson.  It's set in London, as, apparently, is Watson, a former employee of the British Health Services.  The psychological thriller, with its female protagonist/narrator has been sold in 35 languages worldwide.  It has been bought to be filmed by Ridley Scott's production company, with Rowan Joffe to direct.<br /><br />A mysterious accident has left Christine Lucas, former novelist, an amnesiac.  She wakes up every day not sure of herself, thinking she should be much younger, not recognizing the house where she lives or her husband Ben, who's obliged to explain it to her all over again, every day.  Then, with the encouragement and support of her new doctor, Dr. Nash, she begins to write once more.  She secretly keeps a journal of what she has remembered during the day, to help jog her memories on the morrow. One day she discovers she's written in it \\"Don't Trust Ben.\\"<br /><br />The Midlands- born Watson's writing is equal to the task he's set himself.  The writer gives us a good sense of London in its seasons, and his narrative, descriptive and dialog are fine.  Despite its female protagonist, I don't consider this dark thriller to be chick lit; in fact, it's a pretty fresh treatment of the female amnesia victim protagonist. However, it's distinctly short of bodies, and the 360 page debut moves quite slowly for a thriller - guess you could call it at a literary pace if you wish.  And then, in the last ten pages, the author abruptly wraps everything up, much as if an editor told him he could write no more.  Still, I did find it suspenseful much of the way through.  But, of course, I am a confirmed mystery/thriller reader, and once we finally received a few clues, I did guess the plot.  Nevertheless, the conclusion it reached finally, was exciting.
B00770KR7W|5.0|Just what I expected from a halo toy. Allthough the Halo Reach toys did seem more detailed, this was alright. Fully articulated. The one drawback with all these toys is that they dont come with enough acccesories like grenades, pistol etc. Considering it cost 25 cents to make at best, they could throw in some more accesories but whatever.
0547884591|5.0|Im just getting rolling with Tim's latest book and I super impressed! The content and the way it is delivered is top notch. I love Tim's writing style and the way he tackles the topics in the book. Taking the 80/20 principle to what you need as far as kitchen tools is genius and I cant wait to grill me up some squirrel. Stoked on the book and looking forward to finishing it I would recommend it to anyone and have already bought copies for my brother and closest friend so yeah 5 stars all the way for me. Even if your not fired up about learning how to cook this book is awesome the learning hacking principles along are worth so much more then the $20 price tag on the book!

B000E6GBV2|3.0|Band of Horses seem to run with an almost anxious anticipation to fall down, restructuring their work to its essential elements, and then delivering it with a sound that fills the room with a fragile hollowness that possess the ability to pierce your soul.  Thought the work is filled with interpersonal manifestations, the soaring guitar washes over which the lyrics are nearly belted out, hardly seems personal at all.  The songs are lush, and dreamy in a wide awake fashion, totally self-absorbed, and designed to draw on a very specific emotional response.  Yet be that as it may, this dream like quality is more visual than musical, allowing the listener very little room to inject their own take, or to create a space in which they can find their own personal comfort.<br /><br />The band sounds instantly familiar, they echoed in my head, yet took me nowhere that I hadn't been before, and much more comfortably I might add.  As good and tight as the band is, they must be careful about their notion of being an Indie group, because their music seems to that of every man / woman who ever heard a Neil Young song, or tried to layer an R.E.M. number with reverb heavy vocals, and epic proportion presentations.  I would have found them a bit more listenable had they not attempted to consume me, nearly bullying me into feeling their pain ... which is why I so often came up short with R.E.M. ... I got the sense of despair, but I wasn't given a sense of hope.<br /><br />I will say that the songs are very climatic, nearly every single one of them ... but I want to be taken for a long ride, I don't need them wowing me with each three minute number.  I would much prefer to be slowly drawn in over the course of the album, tethered to their sonic musical visions as they swept across their very cool atmospheric sky.  And there lays my final issue with Band of Horses, the music is very chilling, if not down right cold, causing me to dive under a blanket in order to find some sense of warmth.<br /><br />This is one of those really really good albums that's just not for me.  I'm so glad that Band of Horses are out there doing what they're doing, I envy the fans who find the music dynamic and listenable, I'm jealous of those who feel the music answers all of their questions, gives them hope, and above all else, gives them a voice ... Band of Horses is a force to be reckoned with, check them out, even if they're being over exposed ... I'll stick with my beloved Galaxie 500.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Keslerh.<br /><br />This is one of those really really good albums that's just not for me.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|I hated how the major parts of their lives were not described at all. Everything felt clipped and incredibly brief.  No wedding scene no baby scene no baby number two scene. I wish the story wasn't over. I want to read more about them as a couple and a family and his point of view.
B003XMUFGQ|2.0|Is it Eric Clapton ... or is it J.J. Cale ... or maybe even Dr. John?  There's no way I can fault this album, how could I [?], note for note, phrase for phrase, inflection for inflection, and chord for chord, much of this release is pure J.J. Cale.  And why shouldn't it be, J.J. Cale opened the door for Eric, and it took years for Eric to admit his influence, then he finally got around to recording an album with J.J., and went on to take top billing ... it must be tough being Eric Clapton, the guitar god.  So, when he's not being J.J. Cale, this elder statesman of electric blues is busy acting and sounding like a black bluesman, and for me, the novelty is wearing pretty thin.<br /><br />Yet unlike Cale, who's music is steeped in a smokey atmosphere, Eric comes across like a lounge singer in a smoke free environment, backed by the likes of Steve Winwood, Wynton Marsalis, Derek Trucks, Sheryl Crow, and yes, J.J. Cale.  Trouble is, this is old man's music, designed for tapping your feet to while you're engaged in something else, barely noticing when the album's over, because there hasn't been one memorable song to reach out and grab you.  This is a release based on arrangements, swells of orchestral movements, and worn out somberness.<br /><br />Yeah ... you might dig this for the first listen, then you're gonna sit there staring at the jewel case, scratching you head, and asking yourself right out loud, \\"What's this all about?\\"<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler
B009KKLQKO|4.0|As others have said, the DVD is lacking more than half the songs performed throughout the Beach Boys' 50th Anniversary Tour. That's the bad news. The good news is you get 21 of them and the picture quality and sound is superb. The direction is excellent and with none of that horrible MTV-style quick editing that usually ruins concert videos. It's not just a collection of short song clips with interviews, it IS the reunion concert, but with half the songs taken out for no apparent or explained reason. It is understandable that some songs had to be cut, but the vast array of classic songs missing in action here forced me to give this should-have-been 5-star product only 4 stars.<br /><br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD. If you are a Beach Boys fanatic you will be mad about the missing songs, but you'll get over it and download some of the missing songs from YouTube. You will watch this DVD often. If you missed the tour and want to know how great it was, this DVD serves as a good sampler of what went on.<br /><br />Like nearly all the other reviewers I am dumbfounded that classics like Surfin' USA, Surfer Girl, Don't Worry Baby, In My Room, Surfin' Safari, Be True To Your School, Little Honda, Wendy, When I Grow Up To Be A Man, Don't Back Down, and Barbara Ann (ALL of which were performed and presumably recorded for this DVD) were not included in the final product. The running time is a too short 68 minutes. There should have been a minimum of 45 minutes more music included.<br /><br />The list price is reasonable for what is included, and this DVD makes a great stocking stuffer any time of year for the Beach Boys fan on your shopping list.
B00000293E|5.0|Willie Dixon penned more than five hundred songs during his lifetime, and was without a doubt the most influential blues artist of his era ... continuing to both influence [just ask Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Chuck Berry, Cream, The Rolling Stones or just about anyone else you could name] and inspired anyone who ever decided to pick up a guitar, drop a disc in the tray, or gracefully lower the tonearm onto a hypnotic piece of wax.<br /><br />What most folks don't know is that this legend was a very big man, weighing over 250 pounds, standing tall against the sky, and left Mississippi for Chicago, where he had the intentions of becoming a heavyweight boxer, even winning the Illinois State Golden Gloves Championship in 1937, and was the official sparring partner for the great Joe Louis.  Being an artist to be reckoned with, Chess Records signed him without hesitation, but he quickly moved into the business and management end of the industry ... though remaining a staple of the studio as a session man and songwriter.<br /><br />And me [?], I was one of those kids who thought Cream wrote \\"Spoonful,\\" that \\"Back Door Man,\\" was just another one of Jim Morrison's sexual adventures, and that Led Zeppelin was totally responsible for \\"You Shook Me\\" ... well that may not be entirely true, but you know what I mean.  This was the cat who laid it all down, this was the cat who changed the world and made all things possible for the likes of Muddy Waters, who recorded \\"I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man,\\" The Yardbirds, who changed my life with \\"I Ain't Superstitious,\\" and moved Brian Jones along with Levon Helm [of The Band] into thinking that white boys had what it takes to howl at the moon.<br /><br />Of course you won't be hearing Willie's entire catalog of material here, and there has never been a boxed set that contains everything ... though perhaps one day.  But for now I'm sitting here with a mile wide smile, nodding my head, blissed to the max, just digging the voice of the master, a man to whom we owe so much.  This is a perfect album, there's no excuse for not owning it ...<br /><br />Review by Jenell Keslerx, just digging the voice of the master, a man to whom we owe so much.

B000U0F7RG|5.0|For anyone who loves Gilmore Girls, this collection is a must.  I snagged it at a great price, so it was extra great!<br />It comes with a book of Gilmore-isms and a second book that is a complete breakdown of every episode and seasons.
B000001FSP|5.0|Few artists from the 60's have been able to reinvent themselves as well as Maryanne Faithful has, though truth be told, she was pretty much a product of the music industry ... first lovingly coaxed into singing the classic Rolling Stones song \\"As Tears Go By.\\"  But that was back in '64, when this teenager, and girlfriend of Mick Jagger, managed to persuade the world that she actually felt and understood the nature and depth of the number.  Years later she would admit that she didn't have the life experience to sing the song with such believable passion, and would re-record it.<br /><br />Maryanne knew but two things in her sweet short life ... those were drugs, and the pain from her childhood, both of which manifested themselves in her later relationship with Mick, Brian, and the rest of The Stones.  These, along with her low range cutting vocals, and material that captured the changing sexual attitudes of women, along with the despair she felt at not being taken seriously, often cast to the gutter, gave her the tools to rise from the fires of addiction to record Broken English, covering the John  Lennon song, where she held absolutely nothing back.  At the time I thought this was one of the most brilliant records I had ever heard, briefly raising her above the status of Patti Smith.  But the longer I listened, the more the songs filter through my head, the more distasteful this album became.  Broken English was like listening to a car crash, or viewing those horrid images captured from Vietnam, with little children running, the napalm still burning their flesh.  It got to the point rather quickly that I realized that as brilliant as this manifesto was, there was no way I could possibly listen to these tales of horror and woe any longer.<br /><br />I must rate this album rather highly, though I will never listen to these lyrics or chords again, it's all just too uncomfortable for me.  And to here credit, I doubt that there are but a handful of albums out there that present such raw truth and honesty.  I highly suggest that you read her autobiography \\"Faithful,\\" it will chill your soul, connect all of the dots, and open some doors you'll wish that you could close.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Keslrpresent such raw truth and honesty.

B003YBNRHU|4.0|Every once in a blue moon, there's a group who is the genre, and in this case, with the release of their long overdue and smokin' album World Gone Crazy, the Doobie Brothers step forward to announce that they still remain the undisputed truth when it comes southern influenced rock n' roll.  The Doobie Brothers have stood at the center, like some blazing summer sun, around which circle other great southern bands like Lynyrd Skynrd and Molly Hatchet, not to mention all those that have flashed out, or been swallowed by the black hole of obscurity.<br /><br />Like The Doors who laid down some of the most famous dark rock of all time, sparking others to take their own journey, they set the pace, they textured and laced their music in a manner that will stand for all time ... the same applies to The Doobie Brothers who continue to pop like June-bugs on the bayou, causing your head to bob like it ain't attached to your shoulders, and giving your backbone a life of it's own.  While others may fail miserably at this attempt, The Doobie Brothers have re-recorded, and re-released their first single \\"Nobody\\" on this album, and it's firing up the charts, debuting this week [November 25th] at number 29, while the band finds themselves in Europe in support of the album's release.<br /><br />Right out of the box there are those who are gonna try and impress you with their use of the word mellow.  Let me assure you, there is nothing mellow about this outing ... what The Doobie Brothers have done is to create one of the tightest, hypnotic, and driving albums of their long and extensive careers.  Willie Nelson drops by to add his support on \\"I Know We Won,\\" while Michael McDonald, stops by on \\"Don't Say Goodbye,\\" the two weakest songs on the album, and should have been the bonus tracks instead of \\"Little Prayer\\" and \\"New York Dream,\\" but hey, they didn't ask me, so you won't find my name on the credits.<br /><br />What you will find me doing is screaming, because I had two tickets to their show at the Hammersmith Apollo, in London on the 29th, along with a round trip ticket that I couldn't use ... I know I'll be kickin' myself in the butt for the rest of my life, yet alone blowing my chance to hook up with a dear friend.  Oh well, perhaps in another life.<br /><br />Don't go kickin' yourself, this blazin' piece of wax is a keeper ...<br /><br />Review by Jenell Keslertheir show at the Hammersmith Apollo, in London on the 29th, along with a round trip ticket that I couldn't use ...

B000H309P6|3.0|Like so many, I found myself lost in the rather dense and personal world Peter Hammill creates, and then it occurred to me that I was listening not only with the wrong ears, but in the wrong time.  Like Brian Eno, who washed an atmospheric background on which Roxy Music laid their songs, Peter and his visions were at the core of Van Der Graaf.  It was only by thinking of Peter prior to Van Der Graaf that I was able to have and savor my moment in the sun.<br /><br />I need light when listen to Peter Hammill, especially here on Chameleon In The Shadow Of The Night, I need to be able to see the leaves of the trees turn in the breeze, the grass ripple, and hear the distant bark of a dog.  I had been home from Vietnam for but a few short months when Chameleon crept into my life, filled with with Peter's unaccompanied guitar and piano, obsessed with lost faith, lost love, a loss of self, the bending of space, and even questioning the nature of existence, all things that were sweeping through my heart.  I'd just returned from one of the most dense and complicated places in the world, my head was reeling as I attempted to peal back the layers of the last two years only to find myself getting more lost and confused.  I found a simplicity in this album that was balanced by some rather abrasive vocals that oddly caused me to both smile and exhale with a sense of relief and satisfaction ... finding that I wasn't the only person who's life seemed to be a mystery, filled with anger, remorse, and that period of suicidal contemplation.  Though not actual suicide mind you, but the conception of creating a fresh start, wiping the slate clean, and reforming myself by sheer will, or moving on.  I, like Peter soon realized that was impossible, that the only way to survive, and not get drawn into the wasteland, was to come to terms with who I was, the things I'd done, what I'd seen, and how I felt about all of it.<br /><br />I was so caught up in Peter's minimalist approach, that it actually took years for me to discover that some of the songs where epic, complex, and so beautifully counterbalanced the others that it was impossible to separate or compartmentalize them ... these songs could not exist in their own right, they needed the whole to fully express the individual ... and I think that's what I missed most, I was home, I was safe, I was in America, but I felt lost and alone, in a sea of faces I did not know.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Keslerally took years for me to discover that some of the songs where epic, complex, and so beautifully counterbalanced the others that it was impossible to separate or compartmentalize them ... these songs could not exist in their own right, they needed the whole to fully express the individual ... and I think that's what I missed most, I was home, I was safe, I was in America, but I felt lost and alone, in a sea of faces I did not know.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler

0547884591|5.0|Not sure if they give out the Nobel for improving the lives of average Joe's like me - but the learning adventure that Tim has taken me on has improved my mind, body and soul.  His diligence in putting together his books is second to none.  I am a better employee, dad, husband and now cook (as I don't feel I deserve the title of cook).  Breaking life down into smaller pieces or hurdles has greatly improved my life.  As a lifetime learner, I hope that Tim continues to evolve within his craft and tackle another topic that highlights his worldly experiences.  Keep it up Tim, I owe you BIG TIME!!!!

B007THA4FI|3.0|The things I liked; the premise and setting. Perhaps I've been so spoiled with being spoon fed the character development in the Harry Potter series that I'm not giving this book its due. However, I felt like I didn't get a chance to get to know the rich character pool she built. In fact, I must admit that I had to make a character list when I started the book in order to stay up with her.<br />I WILL buy her next book because I want to see where she goes from here, but this one was disappointing.
B009POCFTG|3.0|This is a nasty piece of southern fried noir,none the characters in this film have don't any redeeming qualities whatsoever,this is what made the film so interesting to view and understand, the story is about a dude not being able to pay a debt to the crime lord in his town , and scheme to get his mother whacked(killed) to collect on the insurance policy! so he's go about hiring a corrupt cop named \\"Killer Joe\\", who has a reputation for doing hits (killing people) for money, there are a few sub-plots leading to a wild conclusion, watch this movie with a batch of friends who appreciate crime movies and over the top acting! this one is one short straight to the point crime movie.It is definitely a guilty pleasure to watch.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Just when you think you have a handle of the storyline at the end of the chapter Collins throws in a jaunting twist. Great Book of a great series!!!

B008J34466|5.0|This might be my favorite Pink album to date.  Favorite tracks include:  Blow Me (one last kiss) and True Love, but I think the real gem of the album is Just Give Me a Reason.  it is truly a beautiful song, lyrically and melodically!  The guest vocals from Nate Ruess just takes the song to a whole new level.  I also love the beat of walk of shame and here comes the weekend!  Beam me up is hauntingly beautiful.  This album has a little bit of everything:  songs to rock out to that you would expect from Pink but also beautifully truthful songs that resonate with you long after the music has ended.

1401224792|4.0|True to his name, Bigby Wolf is a wolf -- a big wolf -- when he's not in human form.  He is, in fact, a werewolf's werewolf, a leader of the pack, so to speak.  He's also the seventh son of the North Wind, whatever that might mean.  At the very least, it means he has some control over the winds.  Oh, and Bigby enforces Fabletown law, which sets up the story but only becomes important at the story's end.<br /><br />During World War II Bigby fought Nazis in Germany, particularly those who were trying to revive Dr. Frankenstein's experiments.  In the present, he finds an American town that is populated entirely by werewolves -- and that happens to have a connection to his past.  It turns out that Bigby isn't so much welcome there, resulting in a good bit of werewolf on werewolf carnage.<br /><br />As werewolf stories go, this one has some surprisingly intelligent moments.  The characters have purpose and much of the story is enjoyable.  I was particularly keen on the discussions of werewolf politics.  Of course, it's all just an excuse for werewolves to tear each other apart, but the atmosphere and backstory make this an entertaining read even without the werewolf wars.  In fact, the pages devoted to werewolves running the streets and biting each other are least interesting aspect of the story.  To my mind, however, the surrounding story makes up for the more mundane scenes.<br /><br />The art is a little puzzling.  Sometimes the rendering of faces is as fine as I've seen in a graphic novel.  Other times you wouldn't know you were looking at the same face.  Sometimes the rendition of the nude female body is rather pleasing, and much more realistic than most of the DD-cup obsessed art in comicdom.  At other times, nudes are sketchy.  Coloring is sometimes sort of pastel and pixilated (an interesting effect) while at other times it's more generic.  The art didn't entirely put me off but I think the graphic novel would benefit from an artistic do-over.  Still, I liked the story enough to recommend the book.story enough to recommend the book.

Each time I got 15 minutes (yes, minutes) into the download which was about 390 MB or 850 and it would give me a message saying I'd have to try again. Total garbage. I talked to customer service through Amazon and they tried to troubleshoot and they couldn't figure out what the heck was going on either.

B009E3EYS8|5.0|First of all I decided to rate as 5 stars due the quality of the recording. It sounds as best of studio album. Instruments fidelity is precise and the transition between tracks with the audience sound gives a great ambiance. Related to the DVD, all the scenery of the concert places you as if you were within the stadium. The shots in different angles play a role here adding a dynamic moving sensation as you continue seeing the concert. Alternate retro effects one stage was and it is great. I am a fan of Zeppelin since my &#34;Dancing Days&#34;... and this work from my point of view is one of the best of their entire career. I recommend this to any true fan of Led Zeppelin. You will not be disappointed.

B004HW7JH4|5.0|I have always loved &#34;Mad Men&#34;. It chronicles events in an era and in a business that was my life during the 1960's and beyond. In addition to excellent production values and acting the writers and producers have achieved an accurate sense of the ad business of that era. Sometimes the soap opera aspects are a bit overdone, but not much. As a former &#34;Mad Man&#34; the show is true to what went on in those days. For me it's a great nostalgia trip.

0547884591|5.0|This book is good for anyone that likes to think for themselves and aren't afraid to actually try something different. There are many lessons, the central one being, learning to cook simple and delicious meals without overwhelming yourself. The rest is filled with insights culled from a lifetime of experience and adventure. Written with a sense of humour, highly recommended.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I really like this and I know my tablet is protected.  Easy to use and worry free. I only use avast.
B0037QM8YA|1.0|I don't hate it, but I never got to watch it, it wouldn't play. at first it was in slow motion, then just stopped altogether..Really wanted to watch it:(...
B009GEEMLY|5.0|This movie was great and the picture quality is awesome! Will have to buy this on DVD. I would recommend to anyone that is a fan of the Marvel characters. Will watch again!
B008XBASVY|5.0|I gave Struck By Lightning 5 stars because I could not put it down. It was an easy and entertaining read. I was sad once I finished reading. Wish there was more :)
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I am a huge zombie fan, and The Walking Dead season two was even better than the first season.  Gritty, engaging, and highly entertaining.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Give us more! I cannot believe we have to wait until February to see the rest of this season! But still... Awesome!
0547884591|5.0|This is my second 4-Hour book and I'm more impressed by the way he learns and wants to teach what he has learned.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book keeps you anxious from page to page without giving a dull moment to rest your eyes  The story moves from violence to  unexpected moments of extreme tenderness.  It for me, was one of those books that stays in your mind long after you finish reading and to even feel that the characters are real.  I look forward to reading and joining Katniss to see what takes place in the next book.  A great and enjoyable reading experience.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|How can I get the ad free version to my android phone??  It's registered when I look at my phone and when I manage my kindle account, but not when I try to get angry birds rio.  It's also not available from the play app store on my phone.  Any ideas??
0439023513|4.0|I love that Katniss pursues interests outside her love life.  Certainly her personal life figures in this book.  But she is able to project her interests into the plight of the poor and disenfranchised of her world.  Certainly the hunger games are a huge presence, but I feel that it serves as a symbol of the larger political situation.  I bought this copy for a young friend who. Has read the first two books.  I love that this book is substantial enough to keep my interests when I read it, but appeals to teen readers as well.  This isn't an easy task.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was the best John Grisham to date for me.  The book keeps you wondering about the plot(s) and players right up until the end.  A Great read!
B000VMBXNA|5.0|The Queen suspects that reading as a hobby \\"involved preferences and preferences had to be avoided, preferences excluded people.\\"  She, \\"one as she refers to herself\\" has always put her duty first.  She believed herself to be a blank canvas on which her subjects could project security and duty.  She thinks to herself, \\"I have to seem like a human being all the time, but I seldom have to be one.  I have people to do that for me.\\"<br /><br />She is correct.  As she reads she sees \\"ther lives and other worlds.\\" She also sees the people around her with awakended empathy.  She goes off message at state events.  State leaders and foreign diplomats are asked their opinion on books.  She prefers to read rather than some other activities.  And the palace equiries are alarmed.  Efforts to end the reading emerge.  Questions of dementia are raised.<br /><br />I love this book.  The characterization was human and lucid.  And \\"one\\" could well imagine the whole scenario occuring.  It is also witty and dryly humorous.  \\"One\\" should read it.
B008M721MS|4.0|Wasn't sure how this would work on the kindle fire, but was pleasantly surprised.  The camera isn't the best.  The other person said I looked grainy, but we don't know if it was due to the program or the camera.  I assume camera since other images have turned out grainy as well.  Quick response times and nice portability.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|This is a wonderful adaptation of the book Hunger Games.  I especially enjoyed the recreation of PanAm and it's various states.  The world of the capital, with it's extreme hair and clothing fashions was a special treat to view.  The hunger games themselves were captivating in their reality.<br /><br />I bought this set for a young friend who is ecstatic about the extra material.  Stay tuned, I will give you an update when she views it.
0316228532|5.0|I loved JK Rowling's Harry Potter series and was hoping this would be a similar style of writing.  I have had a little trouble getting into the story but have only read 75 pages so far.  I am hoping that this books starts to captivate me but not yet.  The delivery was very quick and right on the date they told me.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I have a Kindle Fire HD and got Crossme Color for free. I was quickly addicted and ended up buying this version of Crossme. They are both so challenging and fun. With the constantly changing random puzzles, there is always a new puzzle to solve. If you like puzzles you will love Crossme!
B000068TPN|5.0|My favorite war movie of all time.  I misplaced another copy I had so i re-ordered it.  I believe it is relatively accurate depiction of what happened during that battle.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|This book was required reading in college and now 20 years later it seems to take on a different kind of meaning for me.  The second read was so much more than I expected.  The book helped me be more appreciative, less judgmental of others and gave me insight into life and how to deal better with what life throws at me.  We do  have choices about how we think.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|this show is really improving all the time and i would recomend it to anyone. story is very good and actors deliver an amazing preformance.
B007XWFZSA|3.0|Victor Cheng is a great resource! In fact, maybe the best. He's certainly a big reason I got an offer from one of the big 3 firms. However, his website and emails are all you need. You don't need to buy the book. That being said, I recommend this over Case In Point for the frameworks and other invaluable insights, but I read through all of the cases in CIP for great ideas in similar cases. Good luck!
B007RTAR64|5.0|This Barbie is by far one of the best made and most detailed I have ever seen. At the price that Amazon is selling it for you will be more than happy with you purchase. The quality of this doll and her accessories is another selling point if your younger kids are playing with it because the flimsy ones break in a day and these won't. Great details in the clothes down to a Mockingjay pin.
B002WN8IQQ|5.0|I could go on forever about how awesome this movie is. The acting story, drama, music, performances, and romance in Walk the Line. The life of Johnny Cash was incredible. He experienced fame, addiction, love, heartbreak, and everything in-between. Though this film, the amazing acting of Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, and the awesome music, we can see a bit of what this legendary man did. This film is like no other. It's a must see for fans of Cash, fans of music in general, or fans of pure entertainment. You have to see this incredible movie.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I do not know this will be a gift so quality of movie is unknown.  Hope fully it is a good DVD
B007VUA7VO|5.0|i like this monitor. very helpful in helping me see how much battery life i have and what is using my power.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|this is also a gift purchase which i can not properly review since it has not been played hoping the DVD is great quality
B005Y1SVKQ|1.0|Product takes a little to get used to. The biggest issue is that it keeps shutting down. It would also be nice if it could remember the dimension units. It is a little annoying having to restart every couple of minutes. Now that I have had it for a few weeks, the only thing I am able to do is take pictures, as soon as I try to open the pics to add dimensions it crashes every time.<br />Ultimately I returned the product for a refund.<br />Should they come up with a fix I would consider purchasing it again.
1612183956|5.0|I highly recommend this book. I really didn't expect the ending even though I had many good guesses. Think of Twin Peaks, Lost and Twilight Zone as it has elements of all three.
1616202416|4.0|This is a book I was so invested in and I'm really glad it delievered exactly what I'd hoped for. I have never read African literature before but I've heard a lot about it. This book is definitely a good one to embark on to that genre. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it to the hilt. There are grey shades to the characters but I can't help but mention that they are all so well carved particularly from a first time writer, Chimamanda Adichie. There was depth and intensity to every character that was layered so beautifully, that it seemed to you that they were actually exisitng in flesh and blood.<br /><br />Purple Hibiscus tells the story of a 15 year old girl, Kambili and her younger brother Jaja whose day-to-day activities are scheduled by their religiously fanatic yet loving father, Eugene. He is so Christian that at one point in the book we realise that when they visit their hometown for vacation, they are allowed to visit their ancestor worshipping grandfather, Papa Nnukwu for not more than 15 minutes. The contrast between the living standards of the really rich, which are fewer in number and the poor or middle class, which are the majority; is distinctly shown in this book. The protagonist's father, Eugene is a really wealthy businessman and a philanthropist and so it is eveident that they live in huge mansions. Even the guesthouse at their home town is a really large, impressive residence. It is during one of these visits that they encounter their cousins, children of Eugene's sister Aunty Ifeoma and Ifeoma suggests to take them home for a few days at her place in Nsukka, to which Eugene agrees.The kids are soon charmed by the place and their cousins. But unavoidable circumstances unfurl and they are send once again to spend their days with the now well acquainted cousins. Political coup, uneasiness, arrests, murders in Enugu result in Eugene and his wife beoming walking wounds in an empty mansion.<br /><br />This book has you in a viselike grip showing you that whether rich or poor, those who go against the ruling parties of Nigeria shall be severely punished. It leaves you in the end with a palpable sense of ache.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I'he tried them all and in BlackBerry format, I was partial to Docs to Go. However, for my Kindle Fire and Aneroid phone, there is no better.It handles password -protected files, Microsoft Office 2007 docs and it just plain works.<br /><br />I do a lot of mobile writing and light spreadsheet work. Having a reliable office suite that I don't have to think about and can focus instead on content rather than on whether my app will work is key to getting work done and preserving my sanity.
B008N1V11U|1.0|I had to delete all memory for this game and it didn't install right so I could never play it waste of money
0547884591|5.0|I'm starting to get used to his awesome books. Looking forward to the next book. Bravo again. Pura vida Mae.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|This was inexpensive, it arrived quickly and I was looking for a DVD on the cheaper end and my kids chose this one.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Absolutely incredible story... one of those that you could read over and over again and still find new details, new meanings. Definitely a book that leaves a lasting impression!!
B001DHXT20|5.0|This was just what I was looking for. It came quickly and it was inexpensive. It suits my needs perfectly.
B007EW9ISM|4.0|I originally had a ball point pen/stylus combination that was very difficult to use.  This works great and is much easier to write with.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I Love that I didn't have to spend $24 to get this in DVD and Blue Ray when all I wanted was DVD.
0061474355|5.0|A friend whose reading taste coincides with mine from time to time recommended Sabriel to me a few years ago. I borrowed her dog-eared copy and read through it in one sitting. Then I bought my own copy, which is now just as dog-eared, as well as the rest of the series. The story goes full speed almost from the beginning, hardly giving you time to breathe before something new or dangerous is thrown in your way. The ending is both frustrating and realistic, but I'll not give it away anymore than that.<br /><br />It wasn't until recently that I even realized that it was, in some respects, a zombie book (a creature I generally avoid in fiction). His world and its dead are so different from the traditional sort that it didn't occur to me until someone else pointed it out. The necromancy system with its bells, Charter Magic, Free Magic, and the dichotomy between the Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre make for a fascinating backdrop to our main character's quest.<br /><br />If you're a lover of high fantasy and aren't afraid of some darkness, I'd definitely recommend Sabriel.
0071752854|5.0|I purchased this book immediately after seeing an hour-long webisode on Youtube interviewing the author about his ideas and concepts regarding sales - and how the tried-and-true process is inefficient and antiquated. Coming from a sales background as a small business owner and artist, this book is chock-full of great information - and Oren's process is solid. I've begun using his principles already with much success, and I wouldn't go back to the old idea &#34;talk to 100 people, and sell 2&#34; ever again! A great, informative, and easy read. Worth every penny.
B00A6I87UQ|2.0|Just bought this and I'm afraid I've wasted $10. I have it on my Droid X smartphone and it is very difficult to navigate and the displays are to small.  And the menu options are few.  I hope they update this with an better interface and more display options.  I love my two copies of the printed Pocket Atlas and that will have to remain my source for the time being.
B001EL6EHC|5.0|I bought this as part of my sisters christmas present.  I can't wait to give it to her this year.
B008518MOW|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie. It brought back all the feelings of watching the first MIB and how interesting and different it was when it was first released.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|It's a golden years story of people searching for something that still gives meaning to their lives. And it's funny and sad and thought provoking . It allows glimpses of life that is so familiar and yet half a world away. It doesn't shove things down your throat but rather seduces you into the moment. The scenes in the call center are a reminder of what has happened to our country with out-sourcing but also the problems of the populations of those countries trying to understand us. The acting of all participants is excellent. This is a movie worth watching over and over just for the scenery. So get out the hankies and popcorn.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My one dislike with this book is that it is marketed as a children's or tweener book and it is absolutely not appropriate for that age bracket. It definetly has a lot of adult content but is a well written entertaining read.
B003RV43X4|4.0|I am a big Sam Worthington fan. I am also a fan of Sci-Fi and Fantasy.  Combining these two just got better. Since the original was basically made WAY before Avatar type animation or graphics, to see this remake done at this level, just gets puts the icing on the cake.  I own both  and have purchased the next in the series Wrath of the Titans. Enjoy yourselves.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|Rebus with all his foibles provides us with an entertaining read. The introduction of Fox from Complaint adds an extra suspense element
B00932A6G4|2.0|I like Sci-Fi. I really do. I even like animation, both the style of a Disney movie or Japanese anime. The problem I guess with this one wasn't so much as the story line, exactly, but rather the premise. I really think that if they had tried, it should have been live action but then .....So, my recommendation is this. If your really, really, REALLY bored, go ahead and watch it.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Very cute graphics and my 8yr old daughter likes it. But our complaint is it takes to long to earn money to be able to upgrade and to be able to have more dragons. We have another dragon game by a different maker and in the same time that we have played this game we have earn 10x the money and dragons.
B0000AUHPB|4.0|Once you get used to the thoroughly dated look and feel of this film and settle back to watch the 'pros' pull off the heist, it's a 'kick'. This is one of the 60's 'madcap' caper genre from Britain where the loose ends might continually slap you in the face but watching the youthful Michael Caine, the suave Noel Coward and the rest of the excallent cast 'pull your leg' right up to the bizarre ending is a great time. Not too  much 'characterization' other than the actor's own but lots of chases all done with a wink of the eye. If you want to sample the 'different world' of the 1960's or maybe remember it, this is a good start.
1423140605|5.0|For people who enjoy this type of book, this is a good addition to the series.  The action is non-stop and the plot twists in and out of the ancient mythological arena.  This is a good series to introduce your tweens to.  They will enjoy the books and develop the reading habit.  The books are not as high on the list as the Harry Potter series, but they are shorter and more accessible for the young reader.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining films I've seen in years. In an age where a movie seems to need zombies, vampires, mass murderers or superheroes to be successful, this movie is such a gem. The cast is stellar and their performances are outstanding. The basic premise of the film of how one survives after retirement is one which most of us will be forced to face at some point. Their solution is both bold and seemingly reckless. Herein lies the fun! Their journey is not all fun and games, but in the end, you'll want to jump up and cheer--it's really that good! Enjoy!
B0041KVW2K|5.0|The sound of the discs is great; an improvement on the CD remasters which are very good. I did found some issues with some of the discs so check them carefully.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Really enjoyed this quirky movie. The draw would seem to be the stellar cast, but the two kids steal the show. They are so serious and trying to act so grownup in their quest to simply be together. It's very silly, touching and funny all at the same time. I'm a fan of offbeat movies to begin with, so this is right up my alley! Very funny and entertaining!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|For real? This book was an instant hit for me. I could not stop reading.  I have read several Jack Reacher caricature books before and since this book.
B00030DEQE|4.0|I'm sure it's a fine adapter. I discovered that someone had plugged my network cable into the wrong slot after I ordered it.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|It started out strong, but started doing weird things. Sometimes it goes off when it feels like it at random times, and sometimes it does not go off when I set it. I hope that an update is in the works that fixes these glitches.
B0050PYNP8|3.0|I was expecting it to be much funnier than it was based on the previews. Unfortunately, the previews pretty much show all the funny parts of the film and there isn't much left as a suprise. Amusing, but not the gut busting laugh I'd hoped for.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|One of the best Christmas movies I have ever seen.  I would rate this movie right behind &#34;It's A Wonderful Life&#34; and &#34;Miracle on 34th Street&#34;.  If you have never watched it, please do yourself and your family a favor and watch it.  You won't be disappointed.
B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|I chose this rating bc my son (6 years) looks forward every morning to putting one Lego model together. It is fun for him to follow the calendar numbers.  The only reason the one less star bc I feel it is a little pricey. Otherwise, I will probably get another next year bc he enjoys it so much. I know many others feel the same way and will probably not opt to buy it bc of the hyped up price tag.
B002Y4Z4UQ|5.0|Great record before they left Motown Records. It was unique with sung choice that the record has. I have to say that it is fun to listen to.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great app for both my iphone and Kindle Fire!  I recommend this app for anyone who has either unit and wants to stay connected to friends and family.
B0001XPY1G|5.0|I simply love this CD right here. All the hits in one makes me smile with happiness and respect for them.
B0047AJ046|5.0|This album is a cool experience for me. I mean I just love this album, it's really really amazing now!
B001CU1RRM|5.0|The fact that the third CD has Say, Say, Say on it make it alright. The disc is awesome anyway.
B005P89F1C|5.0|The songs on this album are really good especially &#34;Drummer Boy.&#34; When Justin was in the UK Tinie Tempah joined in!
B0033TJATW|5.0|When I first watch this movie here, I had to watch it over and over again. I had view it before I was old enough to purchase on myself.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Its the only note app on every platform and syncs perfectly to all. Easy to use and beautifully designed. Highly recommend it.
B004498KPU|5.0|THE BEST!!! I have a lot of exciting and fun with this DVD collection of Michael Jackson videos. Brings good memories to mind.
B00866H7SS|5.0|WHAT A WAY TO START AS I AM A NEW READER. THIS IS THE SERIES TO START WITH FOR SURE I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE ENDING
B002VECLVY|5.0|If I'm not mistaken Tom Ford wrote AND directed this film! Very very well written and acted. Has a bitter sweet ending. I'll not forget this one any time soon.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|WHAT CAN I SAY BUT WOW. I HAVE ONLY JUST STARTED TO READ BOOKS AND THIS SERIES HAS ME CAPTIVATED.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is by far one of the most astounding apps I came across. Functional on all levels. I use it when I'm taking classes with the use of my kindle fire. I was able to make the sound run through my kindle through moderate tweaking with the sound properties. Overall the app is a great remote. I can access my movies and music with out having to save to kindle and eat up memory. I got it while it was free and am overzealous that it was this amazing. Grab it if you have wifi access.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I liked the honesty of this account which expressed the full range of emotions that a soldier experiences. It was refreshing to see that the facts as they are allowed to be shown are given without undue drama, just a quiet dignity and the authenticity of a professional. The reader is left to make their own judgement and one can ask for nothing more.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|No Easy Day is straight forward to read.  I like that it is not overly-dramatised, yet is believable and demonstrates the service, dedication, committment and bravery of American SEALs and support forces and the tough job they undertake.
B006CDCWDM|4.0|Great book. excellent story about Rafa. highly recommend to those who want to get to know rafa a little bit more.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Although some might find the content disturbing American Sniper is very easy to read and helps one understand the difficult situations at home and on the job the SEAL teams face.  Someone had to travel and do the job of the Sniper other wise trouble makers would be on our doorsteps.
1400049628|5.0|When the SHTF, I will be much more comfortable knowing I have this book in my bag, and the contents of this book in my brain. Will assure that my stay in the world post zombie apocalypse will be a long one.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|mitch albom has the ability to paint scenes that take you to the characters of the book, and then make you wonder if that is possible for you to emerge into and beyond the time alluded to
B002T9H2ME|5.0|i loved the concept here, it made me sad, but more aware of alot of things, like where technology is heading. this is a good movie to watch that makes you think
B008U85TV4|5.0|Amazon sent me an email and it was like &#34;how would you rate Andrew W.K. I get Wet (10th Anniversary Deluxe Edition)? I was like &#34;do you mean the CD version, or the record version?&#34; I have both. That's how good this album is. If I could play the record version in my car or on my iPod I would, but I can't, so I have the CD version, too. Both are fantastic.<br /><br />Do you like to party? I do. Do you like to stop worrying about stupid stuff and just focus on having fun in life and enjoying what we have while we have it? Then you will enjoy this album. So dumb it's smart, so smart it will scare you and make you wonder why you've haven't been living hard enough. It's unadulterated and pure. It doesn't worry about what anyone thinks. It is I Get Wet, and you should listen to it and then live it.<br /><br />Love,<br />Dan
B00004R99F|5.0|i love this movie because i grew up watching it. its funny to watch it when im older, because some of the jokes make more sense! who doesnt love Goofy anyways?? this is a good family movie, i would recommend it to anyone!
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Fun movie to watch.  Some scenes are not for very young kids. Still a good flic. It almost matched the old school T V show.
0547884591|5.0|Another home run from Tim. Thanks! and get on that Ultra, 100 miles or bust! Pace a friend in a 100 first. you'll be hooked.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|Rented this during a boring rainy day.  The flic was not bad.  The action held up throughout the movie. The plot was so so.
0547884591|4.0|I like this book a lot more than the 4H body though not as much as his first book - 4H workweek - which is IMO still the most revolutionary and motivating one. This newest book is better researched and more useful than the previous one, although occasionally just a random conglomeration of (albeit interesting) topics from online resources.<br /><br />The \\"narcissistic\\" angle I've half gotten used to, but I am subtracting one star for the (in all his books) continued use of quotes at the beginning of every chapter. Letting your team find marginally relevant quotes for each subtopic might make you look intelligent to some and certainly increases the page count of the book, but it's actually very distracting for the reading flow.<br /><br />All in all, I am happy I bought the book, even though my interest in cooking is limited.
1451696191|3.0|I don't exactly live the typical high school experience. I've never been to a football game, prom and I'll never be exposed to the cliche idea of high school. The Perks of Being a Wallflower, by Stephen Chbosky, portrayed a standard high school experience through the naive and outsider eyes of a boy named Charlie. This novel exposed me to a whole new perspective of high school and the layers of how teenagers develop. The author chose to illustrate the story through letters written by Charlie. He explained how he saw things, and the daily challenges he faced throughout his first year in high school. The letters guide the reader through Charlie's freshman year and his struggle to break through a whole new social world. The format of the novel also allows Charlie's character to seem more personable and relatable, which made room for the reader to connect with the text. This novel portrayed the idea of an outsider, someone who was different, finding their place among others. Chbosky highlighted this whole idea of acceptance, friendship and also the idea of family. Charlie was a slight outsider even within his family, which is something most people can relate to, and found a true connection among some of his peers. The idea of true family, not necessarily being blood, but the people who love you for who you are. I recommend this book to those seeking an easy, relatable and also slightly sad read. Although this book illustrates the light in Charlie's life, it equally highlights the dark, furthermore I do not recommend this book to the light-hearted. I also stress paying attention to the text and how Charlie's feelings evolve, only then can the reader truly appreciate the plot.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|Purchased this on the assumption it would also charge the Kindle Fire, but it does not.<br />May work fine for transferring data.
B00860YICC|5.0|Love the Movie great story line good music kind of historical in a way back to  the early part of the 20th Century
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|I've been a fan of animated movies my whole life.  The visuals are usually stunning, and the stories are usually better than \\"regular\\" movies.  The visuals in this movie are nothing at all special.  We've seen it all many times.  The story is so weak, it almost doesn't exist.  The heroine's archery skill serves nothing, in fact I wondered why they included it in the movie. Surely she could have gotten in trouble a myriad of other ways?  The bear was too cartoon-ish. It felt like the makers couldn't quite figure out if this was sad or funny.  The horse, a buddy in the beginning, disappears when the going gets tough. I also found the dialog hard to follow at times because of the accent.  The best and most significant character in the whole movie is the red hair, and in fact it dominates the screen.  So why not have the hair be a significant part of the story?  (yes, Tangled has been done, and very well, but there must be other ways to use such a head of hair.)  I'm not sure how something this half-baked gets made.  Next time send the script out to someone who knows how to create a good story.

1608871517|5.0|I couldn't wait to get this book - I put it on reserve as soon as it's publication was announced.  I am not just reading it, I am savoring it.  I cherish any chance to learn more about Michael Jackson especially from those who knew and worked so closely with him.  Michael Bush was with Michael for decades and shares many of his stories and behind the scenes - and seams!- memories.  I thank him for sharing these treasured times with those who also loved Michael - his fans.  This book is a must have for any MJ fan.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A instant classic. I will be reading this book over and over. Giving life meaning and being able to look at our faulty stars and still see the great love and hope for humanity.
B00AAQWMB4|3.0|I love this game although this app is not totally User friendly.  you need to know how to play already or this could be frustrating. I still have not figured out how to play a friend using this app. also even on level one it is very difficult. hopefully it will update and be easier to use!

B004K4IZ3G|4.0|While I was left asking for more, it was a solid follow-up of arguably a classic and underrated SciFi film from the 80's.  I was 10-years old when the original came out and LOVED the Sprite, the Tanks and the Light Cycles.  This re-boot went over the top and lost the darkness and grit of the original.  The original is still stark, scary and deep (in parts).  I will watch the original any day over the re-boot, but the re-boot is still nice eye-candy and a film worth watching if for the effects.
0316228532|5.0|It's not Hogwarts, but what Rowling accomplishes in revealing the heart and darkness of racism in the Harry Potter series, she accomplishes similarly about poverty in \\"The Casual Vacancy.\\"  This is not a book appropriate (or written) for children.  Parts of it may make you sick if you're squeamish or prudish or sheltered.  But it's important.  It's the sort of story that needs to be told, is engaging in the telling, and will leave you different than it found you.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|everything is great for the price. only thing is battery indicator would help out a lot. If I could, I would rate it at 4.75*
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book got me at the &#34;get go.&#34;  John Grisham came out ahead of the rest with ths book.  A must read.
B0031RS4UM|4.0|I've read a few Reacher Books starting almost at the end and am now working from the start. It's action packed - he's a good guy without being too good, Holly is a strong character also. Very enjoyable well worth the four stars. Bit disappointed Tom Cruise has made a Reacher film  - Cruise  way too small for this army man!!!
B00129H7VS|5.0|Without a doubt, this is my favorite all time movie/series ever.... Hands down. I am a Veteran Paratrooper who did 4 yrs in the US Army and can appreciate what these men and women have sacrificed. This series is so spectacular I owned it when it first came out, but my wife mistakenly gave it away  when we moved. There are very few movies that I would honestly buy a second time around, but this series I would repeatedly buy to continue to view. Don't tell my wife this because she might want to give this one away too.. God bless our troops..
B009XY97VC|4.0|The only real diversion from what you would expect from a Two Steps From Hell album is the first song. The first time I heard it I was blown away when the dubstep dropped. The rest of the album is stuff you would expect in the epic score genre with a few more songs with vocal accompaniment. Overall an 'epic' album that I look forward to hearing in some future movie trailers.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I was leary of getting this backpack because it's an Amazon product, not from a known photography \\"brand.\\"  Well...it's AMAZING.  It has everything you could need as a photographer...space for cameras, lenses, a tripod, protected pockets for remotes and memory cards and even has a front zipper space that has a perfect pocket for my iPad.  Plus it's padded, which makes it SO comfortable to wear.  It's the best thing that ever happened to my cameras.  Thank you, Amazon!!

B005G5PPGS|5.0|I am not a baseball fan, but this book has changed that for me. With what wonderful talent Michael Lewis delves into the deeper meaning of baseball statistics and records a hero's journey where rebels and misfits end up winning the boon of new knowledge. A great book.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was such a great read, I could not put it down! The title fits so well, great story of a couple's struggle through their relationship, and I loved the ending!!
B004FS1TLM|5.0|This is not only a good album to have in any collection, but I recommend this as a gift idea also.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I was amazed from the first note on this CD to the last.<br /><br />Linkin Park continues to amaze me with their growth and beautiful sounds.
B003YCI1O8|4.0|The biggest problem with this movie in blu ray is that the monsters look more fake the clearer the movie is.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I had no intention of reading a young adult series until I saw Hunger Games ist movie.  While I watched the special trailers at the end of the movie I got interested.  The production was made with lots of love and attention.  I bought the trilogy and was not dissapointed.  I really loved the whole thing.  The story held together with more than a few twists and turns.  A very good insite into the possibilities of future horrors.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|We watch this movie every year on Christmas Eve.  They did a great restoration so the clarity was magnificent in blu ray.

0316069434|2.0|Not up to his usual standards. Unrealistically violent ending. Seemed to be searching for a way to end the story.
B004SUDPWI|5.0|I was amazed at how beautiful this movie transferred into blu ray.  Most look good but this looked great.  I'd forgotten how good the screenplay and acting was in this movie.
B003UV8TFE|5.0|This is a fun, informative, and helpful (for understanding Physics) book!  The author has an amazing gift for making Physics understandable and fun.
B003H9M1QM|5.0|My dvd version was about worn out.  It's quite an improvement from what we had and brought a different look to a favorite.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|There is not a song on this album that I didn't enjoy! Something about this talented young man takes me back to artists I loved when I was in my teens and 20's like James Taylor and Dan Fogelberg. His songs tell stories, through the lyrics and the emotion of the performances. I think this is a stellar debut album, and the BEST debut album of any AI winner. Phillip Phillips is here to stay, and I am thrilled!
B004XVMCMQ|4.0|I can honestly say that this is the best version I have seen of this Jane Austen Book.  I think there is room for better.

B0029XFNAI|5.0|This is one of those movies that we have mixed feelings in our home about it.  Some like the original version and some this one.  It's worth having in our collection.
B007704HO6|5.0|This is a great book.  Thought I wouldn't like it as how good can a book be about a man and his cat??? I was wrong!  It is so much more than that and now I want a cat I can put in sweaters and walk on a leash.  Highly recommend this read.
B003L20IJW|5.0|I purchased this for someone who is just smitten with this particular series.  She loved the movie as she did the first.
0547884591|5.0|This book is AWESOME! Thanks Tim for taking the time to research all this info and condensing it to something we can all use. Looking forward to the next book :) The 4-Hour.....?
B005BDZN62|5.0|I have always missed this movie in a bigger, clearer version.  This is an amazing transfer to blu ray.  Loved it.
0547884591|4.0|Very well organized, very well laid out, story telling style (which the author seems to like), holds your attention through some pretty beefy brain dump. Pick a chapter, sit down, read it. Pick another. This is a fun book, and one of the most beautifully illustrated modern books you'll buy. It's coffee table graphics make the content much easier to digest. It's not for everyone. But, it's a fun read for anyone who wants to learn some useful stuff.
B005JZBP8W|5.0|This has been a favorite musical of mine for a long time.  It holds up even after all of these years.

B003LPV960|5.0|We bought this since we had loved seeing it in the theatre.  My sister is a Nanny McPhee fan. Good movie.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Hey there,<br />I have never read any John Grisham book (dumb move on my part) as he is not really a writer that my age group associates with (I'm 22), however I kept seeing this book pop up in all the Kindle book suggestions, sales, etc., so I figured I'd give it a shot & boy am I glad I did!<br />I managed to read it in about 3 days (I am the mom of a tot so there is limited reading time) & just finished it! Wow! I'm really shocked at how the plots & twists were all connected. Mr. Malcolm Bannister was put in jail for a crime he really didn't commit, or at least wasn't aware he committed. He had a anonymous client at the law firm he worked for wire money here & there and since he was the representing lawyer he got mixed in the mess when the client turned out to be a funky & questionable political. The politically involved man just happened to run the bad luck of having a sex slave die in his party (she's a minor)..so all those associated with the political cat get the gavel, including Mr. Bannister. From there the book takes some funky turns and twists...Needless to say I knew Bannister was smart, but this guy is a genius...but a stupid genius stuck in jail. I had suspicions of how the book would end but I never figured it would be the way it was until the very end! If you want a thriller than this is the one to go for! Loved it totally worth the $13 bucks..! I will be back Mr. Grisham & hope there is a part 2 to The Racketeer!
B001HN690O|5.0|I bought this for my son who enjoys watching the panda.  He gets quite a kick out of it.  Good copy.

B0017APPT8|5.0|We have been waiting for this movie in blu ray for quite some time.  What an improvement.  This is a must have.
B008ELUEQC|3.0|First things first, Rod Stewart has cemented his status in the rock/pop world with hits like \\"Hot Legs,\\" \\"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy,\\" and my personal favorite \\"The Final Acclaim.\\" Stewart has basically trended away from rock in favor of 'vocal' works including [[ASIN:B00136NXVI It Had To be You... The Great American Songbook]] (and its off shoots) and even diving into R&B/Soul ([[ASIN:B002OHOEFO Soulbook]]) and classic rock ([[ASIN:B000HEVYR2 Still the Same...Great Rock Classics Of Our Time]]).  The results have all compromised the rock star's classics, but the move to more vocal and conservative work also seems like a move also to consider his diminishing voice and vocal range. Sure Mr. Stewart still possesses that smokiness about his voice, but he has lost some of the power he previously possessed. On the conservative, no-frills holiday offering [[ASIN:B008ELUEQC Merry Christmas, Baby]], Stewart's voice has further waned away. That said, he is able to 'pull off' the effort with the help of simple David Foster arrangements/productions that allow for his voice to shine. Additionally, guests like Michael Bubl&eacute;, Mary J. Blige, and Cee-Lo strengthen and contrast Stewart's aging vocals with stronger, more dominating presences. Uneven and bland a times but always suited to its purpose, Merry Christmas, Baby does enough to cement it's 'chosen' holiday album status as it continues to sell capably.<br /><br />Stewart opens credibly with \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas,\\" firmly anchored in strings, piano, upright bass and acoustic guitar. Stewart is generally restrained and mostly opts for safe treatment of the memorable melody, but adds some 'colorful' notes every now and again.  If nothing else, \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\" sets the tone.  The proceeding interpretation of \\"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\\" is a quite 'tongue-in-cheek', particularly as Stewart evokes some personality to an otherwise very conservative showing. Michael Bubl&eacute;'s presence helps on \\"Winter Wonderland,\\" where the vocalists show sound vocal chemistry when the vocals split into harmony. Nothing incredibly innovative or memorable, \\"Winter Wonderland\\" is safe and pleasant, not 'the second coming.'<br /><br />\\"White Christmas\\" is a sound showing for Stewart, accompanied by the standard string/piano tandem as well as nice solo acoustic guitar work by Dean Park  The sole quibble is that \\"White Christmas\\" is perhaps a tad bit too slow.  \\"Merry Christmas, Baby,\\" the title track, is reprised from Cee Lo's recent holiday album, [[ASIN:B00911LA76 Cee Lo's Magic Moment]].  Also featured is the trombone/trumpet playing of Trombone Shorty. Cee Lo, much like Bubl&eacute; did earlier, serves as a more robust contrast to Stewart's diminishing vocal range. Boding well in the title track's favor is there is more 'personality' exhibited, aided by the presence of soul-laden backing vocals.<br /><br />\\"Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow!\\" features smooth jazz/pop saxophonist Dave Koz providing yet another timbre to the standard production gracing Merry Christmas, Baby.  Stewart barely deviates from the melody, but conservatively alters some notes adding a touch of pizzaz (not much). Thanks to audio manipulation technology, the late Ella Fitzgerald is able to duet with Stewart on an overall solid interpretation of \\"What Are You Doing On New Year's Eve,\\" a Frank Loesser classic.  Chris Botti adds some compelling trumpeting to add some contrast.  The harmonies exhibited between Fitzgerald and Stewart are effective and tasteful.<br /><br />\\"Blue Christmas\\" adds some contrast, opting for a more 'country' nature as opposed to clinging onto the vocal/jazz sensibilities that characterizes most of the album. Stewart delivers a strong enough performance, making \\"Blue Christmas\\" one of the albums most pleasant cuts.  Original \\"Red-Suited Super Man\\" is more innovative, taking on a classic Motown-styled sound and aided by the soulful Trombone Shorty once more.  Stewart doesn't deliver an outright 'rousing' performance mind you, but there are enough colorful moments that he doesn't need to to make \\"Red-Suited Super Man\\" work.<br /><br />\\"When You Wish Upon A Star\\" is a surprising choice, though makes sense in the context of a holiday album.  Predictable, Stewart's interpretation and the overall arrangement is sleepy.  Mary J. Blige adds some needed strength to \\"We Three Kings,\\" though the cut still lacks a fiery spark.  \\"Silent Night\\" is not a highlight itself, but features a highlighting moment by featuring the Page LA Children's Choir.  Closing cut \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" is appropriately tacked on at the end, but unfortunately doesn't atone for a loss of momentum.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B008ELUEQC Merry Christmas, Baby]] is merely average at best.  It serves its purpose and appeals to a key demographic, making it no shocker it is consistent seller.  Rod Stewart does the best with what is left of his voice given his age, which is notable in itself.  Nothing revolutionary or flashy, Merry Christmas Baby 'is what it is.'er an outright 'rousing' performance mind you, but there are enough colorful moments that he doesn't need to to make \\"Red-Suited Super Man\\" work.<br /><br />\\"When You Wish Upon A Star\\" is a surprising choice, though makes sense in the context of a holiday album.

B001ILFUDM|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my grandchildren.  They are now enjoying a great Disney classic in an updated blu ray version.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This one just doesn't work. To much silly implausibilities, not to mention the protagonist is a black man that Grishham<br />doesn't even come close to portraying with any depth.
B001YV504U|4.0|The transfer of this movie to blu ray wasn't as clear as I had hoped.  I was a little disappointed.
B0061JPT46|3.0|you would think that if your going to take the time to package this in a great paper sleeve edition that you would also take the time and make sure you have a great sounding cd. unfortunatly, in this case, they did not. some tracks are in stereo others in mono. at times it sounds like your listening to a worn out vinyl copy with a bad needle to boot. too bad.<br />stick with the past masters vol2 from capital.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|This is how this movie was created to show.  I had been disappointed in our dvd version but I like it now in blu ray.
B009LL4LMM|4.0|This game makes me think of different ways to solve problems.  My daughter likes for us to play this game together.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|This is one of those musicals you either love or hate.  We happen to love it and it is so much better in blu ray.
0547884591|5.0|I'm constantly reading books and listening to audiobooks, so I can be a tough critic.  The 4-Hour Chef is superbly detailed and yet amazingly simple.  I've already purchased several to give away as Christmas gifts, as I feel the cooking skills and life skills in conveys can make anyone's life a little better.  This is almost an \\"encyclopedia on improving your life,\\" and something you can keep referring back to for years.  Mine already has dog-eared pages, passages circled in blue ink, and notes scribbled in the margins.  Well done Tim.
B00466M25A|5.0|We love this movie.  Being able to get it now in blu ray was a real treat for all of our family.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|My wife read the e-book.  She thought this was a very tragic story and is amazed how well she is or seems to be doing after this long ordeal.  She loved the book and would highly recommend this for a read.
B002CN2NCG|5.0|This is a must have if you like westerns.  I was thrilled at the clarity and how great it looks in HD.
B0050XFY4O|2.0|I was quite disappointed after viewing this movie.  I was expecting to see the struggles when older brother realizes that he falls in love with his younger brother, but this part was totally skipped.  The movie portraits that the parents found out the unusual intimacy between the brothers when one is 16 and the other is 10 years old.  I think this is ridiculous.  That kind of intimacy to me is totally normal.  And therefore the transition from brothers to lovers is kind of strange to me. If this intimacy happens between two brothers both in their adolescences, that will be something to worry about.  Many other books I read to talk about this kind of forbidden love are hundred times better than this movie.
B004K00NMG|5.0|This may be an outdated story but in an animated version, it makes for a great fairy tale.  Good job.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|The young K steals the show.  Less antics from Will Smith this time around, but better story line and plot.  Well done and a good show

B00338QENI|5.0|I don't usually like non-fiction, but our book club chose this book and I absolutely loved it! A wonderful story, and also a bit controversial for some lively discussion at our book club.

B008Y1YJZY|5.0|loved this movie in the theater and was so excited when it came out before Christmas this year.  Funny and innocent.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|You'll like it. Don't have time to elaborate. Read what the others say. Tim is a good writer, tireless self educator and all around interesting character. Wanted to show support.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|A must for history buffs.  It presents another and very interesting introduction to the Renaissance and a fascinating review of some of the thinkers and writers preceding Lucretius.
B006S8QY8K|5.0|It was fun and the dancing was just great.  The tango that was played was so amazing that I got the album.  I just really liked it and it makes you want to dance.
1847879071|5.0|Field's book is a very comprehensive of nearly all the types of statistical analyses required for social science research. As a post doctoral researcher who primarily relies on survey research, I have found Field's text helpful and easy to use.<br />My only criticism, and it's very minor, is that Field goes a bit overboard with the casual, fun-loving stuff in the text. It's a stats text, I don't expect it to read like a like novel. I appreciate that Field is trying to make it light and fun, and perhaps take some of the fear out of dealing with stat analysis, but I think he takes it a bit far. Again though, that's just my personal preference, and the nature of the presentations with all the personal anecdotes in no way detracts from the substantive contribution the text makes to understanding stat analysis in SPSS.<br />Definitely a useful text. I would recommend it as a good, thorough general coverage text.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I got this app and played it for a long time loving it. Then I closed the app, went on another app, and came back to subway surfers. All my scores, coins, and characters are erased as well as my power ups. EVERYTHING WAS ERASED!

1609611543|5.0|I threw away all flour and Bisquick, bread, barley and oats - \\"cold turkey\\"  everything that I thought would contain gluten even before buying the book. When I heard what wheat/gluten does to our bodies, I couldn't believe it. Three months have passed and I feel so healthy and went from a size 10 to a size 6! What I do need to do now, is exercise to be in tip-top shape. The beginning was hard, I must admit, but well worth the effort. My diabetes numbers have been normal since I stopped eating wheat. When I do cheat a little bit ;-}, the numbers go back down very quickly, like I would imagine they normally would. I really do believe that my diabetes has been reversed since I've changed my diet.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I purchased this product for my 6 year old grandson, he hasn't seen it yet, because I am enjoying it so much.

B005OK721G|4.0|Action packed movie, very creative. It's a great movie if you are in the mood for gunfire, explosions and blood. Thiwocie will satisfy. The story is ok. No plot twists or anything like that. she wants revenge, she knows the targets and she takes them out. I liked this a movie a lot, I don't know anyone who loves action movies that wouldn't like this movie

0345803507|3.0|i couldn't get into the series. too much hype, ended up renting it out to friends & family & their friends.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I gave this book a five star rating because it took me less than fives days to read; which means it's AMAZING. It's sick, twisted, and dark and has all the tools needed for a true page-turner. It's a book I could not just put down. Every chapter had me rushing to the next--I was at the edge of my seat, as some would say during a movie. It kept me guessing which I loved, like a real thriller and mystery/suspense book should. Gillian Flynn's writing is fantastic, can't complain. You feel a strong connection to the characters and can't help but to want to just jump in the story and be part of the chaotic-ness. I was completely satisfied with Dark Places and recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading awesome thrilling tales. You won't regret it!

B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Good humor, rivalry between guy and horse was funny.  Loved the music and the quality of the voices.  Worth it.
B002JIOOB2|5.0|What library is complete without this series<br />Great to watch at your leisure.  Can watch the continual story when you choose
B003TOMAPC|4.0|Sort of a coming-of-age story for the every day guy who is mildly suffering from delusion.  The part of the young girl was a nice touch.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really can not put in words how much I loved this book. Finished it in one day, just couldn't put it down
1449410243|5.0|My manager and I read through it and laughed so hard we were crying and doubled up all at the same time!  I bought it for my director in the office gift exchange and was worried that it might not be entirely appropriate for a work setting.  Happy to report I was wrong.  She's a cat lover and will laugh and cry as hard as we did!
B002ZG97LK|5.0|Such a great re-make of the original. The original will always be the best, but they have done a great job of modernising a classic while still keeping it as close to the original as possible. The dancing is fantastic and the music is great. An awesome movie.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love the setting to 'do a math problem' in order to snooze or turn off. ;) Great app! I like the gradual sound of the alarm going off compared to my cell phone ;)
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|While I love everything that Mark Whalberg is in, this is a great action movie and a great story line. Even the girls out there will like it.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Please create MORE of these problem solving adventuresome games please!!! Gorgeous photos of scenery - amazing usage of maps- and problem solving! I bought this one day and my 6 year old daughter and I worked on it every spare moment one Sunday afternoon and LOVED solving it. She took this game to school and all the boys were crowding around trying to solve the game again. It is like an Indiana Jone's type game...or if you remember back....challenge of the ancient empires or where in the world is Carmen San Diego.
B004EPZ0BG|4.0|This is quite a funny movie. I bought it not knowing what it was like and quite enjoyed it. A little different which is always good.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|This is not the quality of writing that I expect from Follett. As the story developed, I became involved with the characters once more so did finish and look forward to the next in the trilogy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|First review of a Kindle book I've done.  Excellent read.  Almost couldn't put it down until done.  Howey even tied up the ending nicely and left room for expanding in the future.  Good price for the time spent.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Its kind of fun I think howvever, it's to connected to the social networks for me. Without the option to skip levels that reqiure friends I would have put it down by now. Other than that Its just like the other run slide and duck game. You want to see whats in store for the next  mission.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have to repeat what I said about book three.  This was much more than just graphic sex.  There was real meaning in this book. I noticed the difference when I was reading the first book and couldn't wait until I had read all three.  I am now looking for more titles from E.L. Jones.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I really enjoy these puzzles. Just the right level of difficulty and nice graphics. Like the bonus puzzles too. Worth the download.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All I can say is WOW.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  There was a lot more than sex here.  I would say 'love' triumphed.

0547884591|5.0|The meat of the book is a cooking course.  The side bits are informative and neat.  The \\"How to taste\\" chapter is wonderful, even pro's would find it useful.  I'm a bit of a gear-head and even I found a few gems in very minimalist gear section.  Overall, every part of the book lays solid foundational work.  If you're beyond that there's more than enough good stuff from the folks at the top of the headlines and journals.<br />I've did a quick read through last weekend and here's my plan.<br />Go through and do what it says (budget allowing).  Once I've done it all I'll go back and do everything it says to avoid at first.
0307361012|5.0|Like many others, I have been reading remarkable Scandinavian thrillers since I finished Larsson's Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series. Early on I found the wonderful Harry Hole series by Jo Nesbo, and my only complaint was that the first two in the series had never been translated to English -- and now here it is -- the first Harry book! I ordered it as soon as I saw it was available and began reading the day it arrived (rather than throwing it into the capacious \\"To Read\\" pile).<br /><br />It was everything I'd hoped for. As a fan of this character I so wanted to read the first in the series, and indeed this did explain some things about Harry and went a ways toward explaining some of the allusions from later books. It is a strange book in the sense that here is a new Norwegian detective, the first book about him -- but he is in Australia! This seems an odd way to begin a new (literary) relationship, tossing the protagonist in a foreign country when we haven't even got to know him yet -- but it works. This is a wonderful and interesting read, with Harry travelling across the globe to help in the investigation of a Norwegian woman who's been murdered in Sydney. Along the way we get backstory on this charming and flawed man, who it seems has also been sent away because of problems he had back home. Through Harry we also learn a bit about Australia and its indigenous people, including the Aboriginal symbol for death, the bat.<br /><br />In later books characters often refer to Harry as the police detective who solved the serial killer case in Australia -- and here it is! I am anxious for the second (and as yet untranslated) book in the series, and then I will probably read the rest of the series again. Harry is a terrific character, and Nesbo writes with such intelligence and charm that it will be a pleasure to rediscover this amazing detective.<br /><br />Publisher -- THANK YOU so much for the translation.<br /><br />If you enjoy thrillers and mysteries, particularly Scandinavian, you will love this terrific series, and are lucky to be able to start with this previously unavailable volume. Highest recommendation.Scandinavian, you will love this terrific series, and are lucky to be able to start with this previously unavailable volume. Highest recommendation.

034544678X|4.0|I gained a lot of insight into my dogs from this book. This is the book that I regularly recommend to people who adopt dogs, because the focus is on human behavior and its impacts on our dogs.  I use what I learned from this book on a daily basis, particularly in my body language when giving commands to the dogs. I do not chase my dogs when I am trying to get them to leashed up; if they are running away, I turn away from them instead, and they follow me.  If the dogs are jumping to get on the couch, I cross my arms and lean forward.  If they are vying for attention, but not at my request, I turn away.<br /><br />This book is lengthy and it isn't built around tips and tricks, so I had to read the book a second time to take notes on the particular issues I am interested in.  I wouldn't recommend this as a training book; rather, I would recommend it WITH training books to help understand the philosophy of training advice.<br /><br />This is an excellent book by a well-respected trainer.
B0056JJXOO|1.0|The movie started with many starts and stops, less than 3mins into the movie it froze never to start  again, I tried to contact Amazon to complain about it , could not get to first base,by the way you have several  romeo & juliet  which once I saw them ,could'nt them back on the menu ,please take this charge off my account.

B005NJU8PA|5.0|I have all three of Tim's books, and this is by far the most fascinating, mind-opening one yet.  Tim meticulously goes through the details of learning, mastering, dissecting any skill, using cooking as his &#34;guinea pig.&#34;  By encouraging the reader to step out of his/her comfort zone, he converts the way one thinks about learning into the correct way to learn - and have knowledge STICK.

B001NLKWLW|5.0|Really enjoy all the characters in the book and how the timeframe changes and goes back and forth.  I am about 3/4 finished and have trouble putting it down at bedtime.  Interesting look into the different time periods, social strata, etc.
0547884591|5.0|I pre-ordered the 4 Hour Chef quite a while ago. It was definitely worth the wait. Along with great advice on preparing some tasty dishes, Tim gives his readers the recipe to learn and master some unique skills in record time.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|Went on pause 3 times without me pausing the movie.Only by pressing play multiple times did it start again..Had to restart from the beginning, then it ran through without a hitch.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|I cannot imagine why I never read this book.  While I didn't really like all the philosophical rambling, the story was excellent and the writing simple and clear, easy reading.  It's longish so I got it on Kindle because the actual book is large.
B004NELBPC|3.0|This ap is optimized for the android phone. I have it on a Kindle Fire HD and it would be a lot better if it were optimized for a tablet. Ironically every time you bring it up, it says they have one for tablets but I didn't find that on Amazon. Go figure.

B003O86FMW|5.0|So enthralling,  I just couldn't stop reading.  Just when you think there can't be anymore twists,  they hit you with another.  Can't wait to read the next and final book.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|The cast is excellent and the story is whimsical and sort of innocent, with a lot of texture, sort of like reading a children's picture book.
B002413TY2|3.0|Transporter 3 is a decent action flick, although the first two movies do it all better.  The premise for the story is actually pretty good, but the lead actress is very annoying, and there seems to be an emphasis on action sequences that require Statham to lose his shirt.  I guess they had to pander to the audience.  The action sequences don't break any new ground from the first two movies, but they are fun to watch.<br /><br />If you are on a budget, get the Transporter 1 and 2 Collection.  That's reliable, solid entertainment.
0547884591|5.0|The title may lead you to believe this a book on cooking. But it really a book about how to learn more effectively.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Not as good as book 1 but sure left me wanting more! I found the ending somewhat confusing and will now start book 3

B007XF0X6G|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I thought it was good. That said, let's get the stuff I didn't like out of the way.<br /><br />WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:<br /><br />- The actors spend all their time whispering. Okay, this is fine I guess. Except that by the time you've turned your TV up loud enough to make out what they are saying - boom! You're back in another action sequence, and the sound is blasting at you too loud. This makes the movie a bit hard to enjoy when I'm trying not to wake up my kids at night. One solution is subtitles / closed captioning. But I've learned that nothing screws up the 3D movie experience more than using subtitles. I like them on regular TV. But they can't be used when watching 3D; it's just too distracting. So get used to the whispery voices. And crank up the volume!<br /><br />- The characters are not especially likeable. Other than Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes, I didn't care for most anybody else. Sam Worthington was alright I guess. He has a certain likeability. Certainly better than vacant-eyed Harry Hamlin was when he had his turn as Perseus! But nobody else I really care about. When you see them fighting and dying, it's hard to even give a crap. Even the comedic guy I didn't care for, because he was supposed to be funny and wasn't.<br /><br />- I didn't like the actor they chose to be the villain so much. I mean, THIS is supposed to be Aries, the fearsome God of War? I don't think so. The guy looks like he belongs more in a catalog for men's underwear!<br /><br />- The story didn't make a lot of sense. But I didn't worry about that too much. That's just par for the course for this kind a movie.<br /><br />- The director seems to be a fan of the Michael Bay's \\"Shake the camera really hard and make lots of quick cuts whenever there's an action scene\\" method. Now I know that that's all the rage in movies nowadays. Everybody is doing it. But that doesn't mean I have to like it. Personally, I hate it. I would prefer to just be able to see whatthe heck is going on. A bunch of camera shaking and loud noises does not a good action scene make. Not to me, anyway.<br /><br />- I missed Zeus's lighted costume effect from the first movie. Others railed on that as being goofy. I thought it looked really neat. I wish it had still been here. It's okay that it's gone; I just would have preferred it.<br /><br />- Just like most other action flicks these days, the colors in this movie are all saturated and washed-out looking. Everything is gray. Why does it have to be this way? Why do all \\"serious\\" action movies need to look all gray and gritty? And speaking of gritty...<br /><br />- The actors in this movie are dirty. Seriously, just take a look! They spend the entire movie covered in grime and filth. I realize that showers weren't so popular - or even available - back in those days. And it's true that the heroes have more on their minds than taking a bath. They are trying to save the world and all, but still! After an hour of it, it becomes noticeable. You start thinking to yourself, \\"I wonder if they smell as bad as they look.\\" They are grimy and gross, and get progressively so as the movie goes on. At the end, one of the heroes is even smearing on mud. Finally, the girl gets cleaned up at least. Just in time for her on-screen kiss. I didn't notice this in \\"Clash of the Titans\\", but it's kind of distracting here. I mean dude! Wipe your face already!<br /><br />WHAT I LIKED:<br /><br />- I really like Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. They are good in just about everything, but I think they especially shine in these roles.<br /><br />- Sam Worthington was decent. And what do you know? He doesn't have a crew cut anymore!<br /><br />- The scene at the end I really liked, with Father and son.<br /><br />- The use of 3D in this movie is AWESOME. I own a 55\\" 3D TV, and this is one of the best 3D movies I've ever seen. There are several moments in it that are simply amazing to watch. Several times I just thought, \\"I can't believe this looks so good\\". Sometimes the 3D is unexpected, like when Kronos was attacking and suddenly Perseus is flying up on Pegasus to attack. It looked like he was flying from your living room into  your screen! And sometimes rock would fly at you. Little moments like that were done well. This movie really does 3D well. It never seems gimmicky. It actually adds to the story. (Not that there's much story here in this overbudgeted B-movie to add to, but you get my drift!) The 3D? HIGHLY recommended!<br /><br />- Pegasus was done well. He also seemed more useful in this movie.<br /><br />- The story has continuity with the previous movie. Yeah, Io is dead right from the beginning. That was kind of abrupt. And where did everybody else go? But the rest of it seems to follow really well from the first movie.<br /><br />- The story was good, if a bit confusing. I did like it. As an improvement over the original, Perseus as a character gives up the rather silly notion of \\"living as a human\\", and embraces his heritage.<br /><br />- I liked the notion of most of the conflict being driven by family troubles among the gods. This makes sense to me. I mean, I can't stand my own family and I'm only in my 30's! I can only imagine how annoying my family would be after ten thousand years as a god :)<br /><br />- I liked that this was a sequel. Being a sequel of a remake, they didn't have to worry about all the \\"new\\" vs. \\"old\\" arguments that plagued the first movie. They could just make the movie they wanted to make. This was a good result, I think. And it left itself open to future movies, which I would also be happy to see.<br /><br />- The special effects were excellent. I'm kind of shocked at how far CGI has come. Especially compared to the lame attempts in George Lucas's movies. This makes his films look like \\"Jumanji\\" by comparison. Of course, sometimes the special effects are just too darn good. I don't like it when I get that feeling that I am watching a video game. But you can't please everybody - especially me. Griping about the movie is half the fun!<br /><br />- The weapons of the gods were cool. I especially liked Zeus's thunderbolt.<br /><br />- The labyrinth concept and sequence was neat. I felt like I was watching a horror movie during that bit. And since I love horror movies, this was welcome.<br /><br />- Cyclops? How did they make those pants?<br /><br />- In another nod to the original, the Mechanical Owl makes an appearance again.<br /><br />The verdict: Yeah, it's not cinematic genius but it is still pretty good. Don't let the movie review snobs drive you away. If you liked the first one, you will definitely like this.<br /><br />And if you hated the first one, you might still like it. It depends on why you hated \\"Clash\\". If you hated that it wasn't exactly like the original, then you might not mind this movie because it doesn't have anything to do with the original. If you hated it for the special effects, jerky camera and/or other old fart reasons, then yeah you probably won't like this one either. But I thought it was great.<br /><br />And that's me. I'm done. Peace out, people!<br />-TCG

B007H1HQW0|5.0|I'm a college student and I ordered this cutter to cut up bottles we collect during the weekends. The product has worked so well that we now have a cupboard full of glasses made from old wine/liquor/beer bottles! We've cut at least fifty and the blades are still working fine. We found that the best way to have a successful cut is to get a solid straight score line, then dip the bottle in boiling water (big pan on the stove) and into cold water (just filled up our sink) if you do it correctly the bottles will cut perfectly :) However, keep in mind that some bottles cut better than others depending on what kind of glass it's made with, some are trickier than others.
B006G7Y7GY|5.0|Ozzy has really rode the tale of rags to riches.  A fantastic journey through the hard times, the good times and the hard times again.  The book captivates you right from the start and you actually begin to feel like the 5th member of Black Sabbath after a few pages.  Ozzy is truly a man that has done what he set out to do and left no bad luck out of the equation.  A must read for any Black Sabbath or Ozzy fans.

0525953728|1.0|This book is written at an elementary-school reading level. The writing is dry and boring despite the intensity and heroic nature of the actual events.  Further, the author possesses a hostility towards President Obama that is without explanation or foundation.  He criticizes the president for delivering platitudes when addressing the soldiers after the mission and then goes on to offer nearly identical remarks in the closing pages of the book.  Another example: the author complains that missions are too often scrubbed and then refuses to give President Obama credit for making the decision to go forward with the OBL mission, arguing that any president would have made the same call (and forgetting his earlier comments about the lack of certitude about whether OBL was actually in the compound).

B008645YEE|5.0|Hans Zimmer is one of my favourite composers and this CD is one of the many soundtracks I own by him.  The Dark Knight Rises soundtrack has songs that are primeval, haunting and liberating.... and if you can believe it, sometimes all at once like with the last song, Rise.

B009AZZEU2|5.0|It took a day to really listen and have this album seep in.  But I just can't enough of the album now, it's one of the best albums that anyone has came out with recently.  Though hardcore Badmotorfinger era fans may yearn for something with more drive and up-tempo, if you loved Superunknown then you'll love this one as well.
0345803485|5.0|These books exceeded my expectations by light years.  I was expecting a cheesy story line with a lot of sex, but it was nothing like that at all. The story was incredible and the sex actually played a part in the book.  I recommend this book!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I had the privlege of seeing this before the day before it was released since I was a movie theater employee.  What I had called the &#34;Rag-doll scene&#34; (and so did many others once it was released) got tons of laughs from myself and from my co-workers.  There were plenty more scenes that matched this laug throughout the film.  Word of the wise, there are two post credit scenes!

B00008O89K|5.0|I loved this movie more than anything when i was 15.  I bought the soundtrack on vinyl and listened to it all the time.  During a move, somebody stole all my record albums and afterwards all I had was a badly made cassette of it.  I couldn't even get it on ipod recently, they only have that horrible remake movie soundtrack or a various soundtracks playlist with only one or two songs.  I ordered it from overstock.com a while back and got an email with a refund and an apology for not being able to fulfill my order.  Amazon had it, and now I finally have it on my ipod!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I am trying to read the classics now.  I remember seeing this as a movie when I was young...but never did read the book.  The old style language is hard to follow at times, but it is a must read!
B00A23MYCC|5.0|I had already seen this twice in theaters, so I was in love before purchasing it on amazon. but I was impressed with the streaming quality. The volume was a bit on the low side though.
B007MDB6L0|3.0|I purchased 2 of these movies thinking I was getting a good deal, but if I had waited a while longer I found them in the stores for $3 cheaper.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I don't usually like these games however this game rocks. its a lot like zoo tycoon for dragons except its better.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Could not get enough of this series.Watched every episode over the coarse of a three day long weekend, and then started watching it again.This is not the kind of viewing one falls asleep during.Loved the story line. Loved/loved to hate many characters and justice and injustice was done to many.Don't get attached!
030758836X|5.0|This novel started out slow but when it took off....watch out! Just when you thought you had reached the height of deception, another chapter unfolded. It was a page turner and very enjoyable!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I truely enjoy playing this game fun fun fun.... And not to mention there is never a problem with opening and playing.. NO TECH problems ever
1469984202|5.0|This is a &#34;can't you see i'm reading?&#34; Book. Sucks you in and  then wont let you go! Worth every penny!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I looked at I don't know how many camera back packs, carry bags, rolling bags, all kinds of bags.  Based on the reviews I opted for this one.  I couldn't be happier.  Very nice quality bag and well constructed.  Zippers work buttery smooth and the bag seems well padded.  Comfortable to carry and with the chest and waist straps it takes a lot of the weight off the shoulders.  The shoulder straps are nicely padded as well.  The inside swallows a lot of gear.  If your a pro carrying a zillion lenses and speed lights, you will probably not be able to pack it all in, so, buy two. :-)  At 30 bucks a pop I don't think you can beat it.  The inside is configured so you can carry your camera body with a lens attached (long or short) and the velcro partitions can be reconfigured to pack in different size gear.  One caution though, the back is not terribly deep so long lenses will need to go in lying down.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I love the fast pace to get as many points as fast as u can. works awesome on kindle fire. love the game. One of the best 3 in a row games I have found. Plus its free you cant go wrong.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|Wealth of historical facts and conclusions, which are usually not taught in schools.<br />Dead necessary in an Age of &#34;political correctness&#34; where freedom of speech is muscled by main stream media and peer pressure. Not even in Higher institutions inspirational battles of ideas are fought.<br />&#34;Those who know history, know their place in the world&#34;, said my Greek professor once.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Miss Potter is portrayed as lost in her art and how that not only brings her success but also really gives her life purpose.  She doesn't follow the expectations of young women in her time but rather stays true to her own personality.  The reward is the man whom she discovers while attending to her purpose.  But as life truly is filled with love and grief she must undergo what was probably her greatest challenge.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The third wheel book was very funny book.The beginning was hilarious!!!! Although the book's ending and plot could have been a little more complex.But other than that the book was great I look forward to the next book
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book.  It is a grown up erotic romance.  The characters have mature lives, unlike Fifty Shades of Grey---which I also liked.  This book is fantastic.  Silvia day is an outstanding author.  If you liked FSOG, or just like steamy romance, you will LOVE this trilogy.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|Kids will discover a love of Zoo animals when they play with this set. It can be used with other sets of blocks to<br />help build on their imagination.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|For a basic intro to Kindle publishing, this book covers all of the bases. I found it very easy to read and understand. Happy publishing!
B00A2XU9IS|5.0|My grandson and I are enjoying this app. It has a cute little activity for him to do each day while we count down to Christmas. We have other advent calendars, but this is the only interactive, game type one. A nice addition.
B00003CXSM|5.0|this is a light hearted story about heart.  When she does the right thing the ending is right.  great acting and fun to watch.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Buy it ! You will not regret it. I have never seen or heard such an OUTSTANDING Blues Concert.<br /><br />Joe Bonamassa is the King of the Blues Guitar!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Very cute, good children film, but plot has appeal to adults as well. Great animation.  Enjoyed and would definitely recommend it.
B005LAIGIM|4.0|This movie is like a new direction for Eddie. We know his style and his movies<br />and his motor mouth that can outtalk anybody...but in this movie he still has<br />the motormouth but then coupled with a good script the movie gets better as it<br />plays.<br />  So yes, i did enjoy this movie and i would not have watched it if Eddie was not<br />in it. Recommended..
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|ihad a lot of fun playing this game time flys by when I play this game its very addictive I like the puzzle games
B005URRCUY|5.0|The Black Keys are a very good group.  This is the second album that I have gotten by them and neither one disappoints.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|I love the movie and my grandbabies love it too! I had to reorder because our others had been played too much!
B008DVJO8C|5.0|First heard of ITM through the song \\"Blood\\" on XM, and decided to pick up the album.  Love this record, everything about it.  Maria Brink, their lead singer, has an unbelievable voice.  She reminds me more of Lzzy Hale than Amy Lee.  She can croon and, simultaneously, scream with the best of them.  She puts out some pretty good screams, but doesn't keep it up for the entire four minutes per song.  There's not a lot of fancy guitar work here; you'll never mistake Chris Howorth for Joe Satriani or Eddie Van Halen but you don't really miss the solos very much since Maria has you in her trance from beginning to end.  There's a lot of song variety, as well.  I would have been disappointed if all the songs sounded like their first single.  I am definitely making it a point to search them out on the tour circuit and check them out live.

B003O86FMW|4.0|Great thematic narrative ... makes me want to rise against the institution! It's not as great as the first book, but interesting nonetheless.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Great overall story and action packed with lots of vampire slaughtering :) I would watch it at least  6 more times
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|Lzzy Hale is not only one of the best female rock vocalists out there, she one of rock's best vocalists, period.  You're not going to find a lot of fancy guitar work here, but it's damn catchy and worth adding to your repertoire of hard rock. Having seen them live once probably adds a star to this review; if you ever get a chance to see them in your town, GO SEE THEM.
B000WGZGNS|2.0|AFTER ALL THE GOOD REVIEWS I THOUGHT IT WAS FAIR, IT WAS'NT THE BEST. I WOULD NOT BUY IT. IT THINK FOR THE PRICE IT SUCKED
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I haven't read the book completely yet, but what I have read so far is typically Grisham.  In other words, it is well-paced and intriguingly written.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Actors were believable! A good story too! This makes you want to watch the second Series as soon as possible!
B000YEUUCK|5.0|Very Nice Blu-Ray. High quality of songs and images. I recomend for everyone! Its a Good Choice for a gift
B000MV8XPG|5.0|The digger is a great toy for a four year old. He has no problem digging in his sand box. The plastic seem to be strong enough and yet light enough for him to move it around. I would recommend this toy and would make a great gift.
0547884591|5.0|A fan of previous books this one stands alone as a great introduction to &#34;how to learn&#34;. Could have used this one first but I guess it never works that way. Tons of tips and a fun read. Highly recommend.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Classic Mr. Corey novel. Full of action combined with Corey dry humor. Even though it's a long book, you don't realize it because it's not filled with &#34;filler passages&#34;. It's like a 3 hour movie that was so good, it felt like only 1.5 hours. A little expensive, but hey, it's over 600 pages. I have the kindle version and can't imagine carrying out this behemoth in hard cover! Definitely worth the read though.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great basic calculator. I particularly like how it shows your previous calculation so that you can build upon your previous work without always having to jot down your answer.
B00966TN1Q|3.0|It is actually hard to define what is wrong with this. It has a strong plot with a good finish. I think the problem for me was that I was a little bored with Bosch. After all these years and successes he is still the underdog. He still cannot hold down a relationship. He is an awkward father. To me even the author felt bored with him and the writing a bit stilted. And the biggest plot problem, why Bosch's rescuer was present, was completely ducked. I actually struggled to finish this and read several other books in between. It's not worth the rather steep cover price. If you are a fan of this series you will probably read this anyway as there are enough people out there who enjoyed this. If you are a first timer start with any of the early books.
B008B8DY2O|5.0|Absolutely marvelous! I found a lot of very interesting views on life in this book - an interesting philosophy. To be recommended
B005KELQEU|5.0|I bought this cover for my Kindle three years ago.  It's protected my Kindle well and is easy to use.  It still looks like it did the day I bought it.  A good investment ( was ~$20 at the time).
B00ADYYY50|2.0|So I thought I would enjoy this album because I enjoyed Remember you feat the Weeknd but all his songs are about money... ALL OF THEM.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I am an avid reader, especially large detailed books, but to have a series of 5 books! This is fabulous, it has just enough historical background mixed with the story. It's fabulous! Love it!
0062073613|5.0|Just how did that body get in the library?<br />I bought this book after watching the recent ITV adaptation of it, which left me suspicious as to whether the ITV denouement was as penned by Agatha. My suspicions proved correct.<br />I'm not sure why ITV felt the need to change the original ending. Agatha Christie's is better and far more credible.<br />I know she has her detractors, but I still think her plots are far cleverer than people give her credit for. With its twists and turns, its subplots, mazes and red herrings, The Body in the Library is up there with the best of Mrs Christie.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0985120606 The Night of Harrison Monk's Death: Jane Hetherington's Adventures in Detection: 1 (Volume 1)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00MDSM1PY The Magpie Murders - Omnibus Edition]]
B001F0WXY0|4.0|This novel is considered by many to be a classic.  I agree.  Some have complained about proofreading and typo's in the Kindle edition.  If these problems existed, they have been corrected.<br /><br />I thought the price was a bit high, but that didn't stop me.  (I took off one star for the price.)

B0076DCT2G|3.0|As someone who loves The Lion and Lion's Game I was eagerly awaiting the latest in this series. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to its predecessors.  Storyline was interesting and DeMille depiction of how the various US agencies work together was also entertaining, but Corey's inner dialogue was turned on overdrive and was distracting from the story.  If your a fan of the John Corey series you should read it, but if you are new to DeMille I'd start somewhere else.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Very well written but I felt like the book just stopped and didn't give enough detail about the actual time while in the experience of near death.
B004TSXUWY|4.0|I bought this book after my mother said she couldn't put it down and the end was terrifying. I would agree with both comments. A clever, chilling idea which the author has conveyed convincingly. I also thought the central character was extremely well written, and she came alive for me (even more of an achievement as the author is male - something I found genuinely surprising.) A genuinely menacing thriller - keep reading till the end!<br /><br />[[ASIN:0985120606 The Night of Harrison Monk's Death: Jane Hetherington's Adventures in Detection: 1 (Volume 1)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00MDSM1PY The Magpie Murders - Omnibus Edition]]

B003PIUBZS|5.0|I had not heard about this series until a friend wanted me to track it down. Really engrossing viewing. Fantastic
B00845PT18|3.0|I liked the firet one, but this one fell way short of the first story. It was more like a sequel that was fulfilling a contract--not a need to continue a legend. Very disappointing.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|it is a great app. my kindle sometimes has trouble charging so I'm not sure when it really is or not...but this app really tells me. I highly suggest it

B008D30K7E|4.0|I think I've just read the literary equivalent of Monty Python's Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life.<br />I skipped through the Forrest Gump-esque reminiscences, and concentrated on the latest adventure to befall the centenarian, his friends, the elephant, the dog and a suitcase of stolen money. This alone should tell you this is a book with its tongue firmly in its cheek. It's a parody on the perilous life and death/car-chase genre. It's one for those who appreciate absurdity combined with good old-fashioned chase scenes where good things eventually happen to good people - even if they have to wait the best part of a century for it to happen!<br />[[ASIN:B00ESIVR3O Jane Hetherington's Adventures in Detection Omnibus (Books 1-3)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00MDSM1PY The Magpie Murders - Omnibus Edition]]
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Got this as a FAOTD awhile back and have played through most of it. Air am glad I got it for less than the original price because it is a fairly simple game.  Some things it has that are noteworthy: really nice graphics; a goal and storyline of sorts to go with the puzzles.  Five stars for getting it free, four if I would have paid full price just for the sake of value.

B0051BVQFG|3.0|There was good action, but it seemed more like a recuitment film for the Marines. If the price is right, it's OK for your library.
B007L6VR12|5.0|I love the movie and the quick service in receiving it. Moonrise Kingdom is a quirky sweet story with lots of crazy loveable characters who grow on one each continued viewing. I watch it over and over again.

B002SRQ214|5.0|Bottom line is that for under 100 bucks you won't find this amount of performance anywhere.  I put this in a new mid-range gaming machine paired with 16GB of RAM, an SSD, and a decent video card and it plays every game at medium settings at 1080p resolution.  I've overclocked it to 4.0ghz using a CoolerMaster Hyper 212 Plus heatsink/fan, and it reached just 125F during a 100% CPU utilization test.  Under normal operation at 3.4ghz, it's running at 92F and you can't hear the fan going at all.  Transcoding video and other CPU intensive tasks are a breeze, but obviously not on par with the higher end Core i5/i7 from Intel.  But then again, those CPUs and motherboards are quite a bit more $$$.<br /><br />If you're building a new machine, be sure to get a motherboard that uses the AM3+ socket.  This will enable you to upgrade the CPU well into the future as needed.<br /><br />My build specs:<br />ASRock 970 Extreme3 AM3+ Mobo<br />AMD 965BE<br />EVGA SSC 650 Ti 1GB<br />16GB GSkill DDR3 1600 (4x4GB)<br />Samsung 128GB SSD<br />WD Black 1TB 7200 Sata 3.0 HDD<br />Seasonic Gold Series 550W PSU<br />Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus HSF

1567184855|5.0|The more I read these books the more it makes sense. Incredibly interesting and opens so many doors. Loved it
B007REV4YI|5.0|I absolutely hate when people make comments for media products when the product probably hasn't even gone to be produced yet.  If you want to comment on the film, Amazon has this great little site called the Internet Movie Database (IMDB for short.)  There you can comment to your heart's content.  However since some of you have decided to bash the film here, let's breakdown some of the complaints.<br /><br />The biggest one is that it wasn't as good as the first two Craig Bonds or Pierce Brosnan movies.  I'll let you in on a little secret...neither of those films were true to the character/franchise.  The girst two Craig Bonds did what hadn't done before, it created a story arc over two films in the franchise.  Bond fans know that the one way to make James Bourne's QOS watchable is to watch it immediately after watching Casino Royale.  As for Brosnan era movies, Goldeneye was a good not great Bond movie and every movie afterwards was worse than the one before.  It got to the point that the series had \\"jumped the shark\\" by the time they got to Die Another Day with Halle Berry trying to impersonate Ursula Andress and the storyline/stunts went from somewhat believable to ridiculous.  A reboot was needed.<br /><br />With that as the background for my review of the movie, according to many Bond experts and reviewers, only two men have had the look and played the part of Bond as Ian Fleming intended.  One was Dalton...an actor who was strongly considered to take over the role directly from Connery but was deemed too young at the time.  The other is Craig.  The funny thing about Craig is that after watching him as Bond, you can't help but to view him as Bond in his other movies whether it be Layer Cake or The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.  That is the sign of a great Bond actor.<br /><br />To fully appreciate this movie you have to watch or have a general high level knowledge of all older Bond movies.  The biggest reference was to the Goldfinger Aston Martin which any realfan of the franchise could tell you of that particular car's importance to the series.  (My jaw almost hit the floor when they opened the storage bin and I immediately knew what it was.)  There were all kinds of other references that a Post-Moore Bond fan wouldn't understand.  Little things like the original Bond Theme or very short snippets of music from past films (way too many to list.)  Even Q branch is back to the early Bond films with one \\"gadget\\" where the technology is actually already there for it to be feasible in the real world.  Personally I loved how they reintroduced Eve (Moneypenny with a built-in background), Q [branch] with a technogeek vibe, and perfectly handled the M handover.<br /><br />In short, everyone is entitled to their opinions but in the case of Skyfall many of the opinions that have been posted are based in ignorance of past Bonds or the fact that James Bond is not, will not, and should not ever be in the same style of movie as the Bourne Series. QOS which is like I said at the beginning is a terrible standalone movie in the series since it's essentially James Bond in a Jason Bourne style of movie due to horrendous decisions which started with the producers' pick of directors.  In Skyfall they (or if you believe the drunken Craig offering the directing job to Mendes story) made the perfect selection for a director and made sure to include references to most of the past films.  Fitting for the franchise's 50th anniversary.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book! Couldn't put it down. Never a dull moment. Hoping she comes out with a follow-up to the trilogy.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|My son has read all the Diary of Wimpy Kid books and just loves them.  He is not much of a reader so I try to find things that he enjoys.
B004JK61K0|4.0|Google's Gmail app works best if all you have are Gmail accounts. However, if you have other POP or IMAP accounnts (including Gmail), this app does a good job for checking and responding to email from your Android device until you can get back to your PC.
1780891261|5.0|I love these books!! Reading some reviews I can see some peoples point, but it is fiction (made up/fantasy). Most people read to escape mundane life to a world different of their own.  These books do just that; creating fantasy/beautiful characters, and a fantasy life (to some people it IS very real; yep) purely for the readers enjoyment.  These books also introduce people/the reader to a world that does exist in \\"real\\" life.  To each their own way of living, loving, opinions, and sex.  Very well written and did the job of catching my interest and keeping it for the weekend (read the trilogy in less than 3 days). I also read the Black Dagger Brotherhood collection by J.R. Ward and enjoyed those too.
0393316041|5.0|This one is my favorite out of Feynman's books. Not sure why... maybe it was the story about the Space Shuttle and his buddy the Air Force guy who told him to &#34;always check your 6&#34;.  ??? Entertaining little book... an easy read about a curious character.
B0084AYLK8|4.0|I found this book to be very enjoyable. It is an easy read. I did not give it 5 stars because there are parts of the story that are long and slow. The story picks up about 1/3 of the way in if you can make it that far.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely loved it.  Couldn't put it down or wait to ready book two.  The whole trilogy was awesome.  Looking forward to more Fifty in the future.
B004GYNPL2|5.0|This is the best password manager I've found. The ability to back-up to your computer as well as Google Drive is awesome.
B008476HBM|5.0|They just don't make stories like this anymore!  So well written for the era into this day. Available on Kindle!
1401917186|4.0|Angels, Faeries, Mermaids, Star People and more...I felt much of this content was worth consideration. Some of it I didn't easily connect with but that may just be me. I'm not discounting Ms. Virtue, because I am a fan of her work. I am, however, suggesting that you use your own intuition when approaching this information and you'll do great.<br /><br />I recommend this book if you are interested in exploring alternate realities/entities.
0393320928|5.0|Feynman weaves a great story as far as I am concerned. I am not a physicist and I don't teach at a university... just a normal guy that likes good stories. Great book that you can put down and pick up two weeks later... plus it is cheap.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have read the first 4 books of this series.  Each o ne is fantastic and this one is no exception.  Each of the many characters is written about and personalities are shown.  I have watched 2 seasons of Game of Thrones on HBO and although they omit a lot it is fun to see what they will do with this 5th book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|My favorite of the trilogy.  Looking forward to reading more from EL James.  Hope the movie does the books justice.
B0091HVMVO|5.0|at least so far! I'm less than half way through listening to this set, but have no reason to believe that the remaining CDs will be any less excellent than the ones that I've heard already. Philips has always been my favourite label, starting over 40 years ago when I first began buying classical records. I always thought that they had the best combination of artists, recorded sound and record pressing quality (something no longer pertinent now in the age of CDs, but important then - it didn't really matter to me how good an artist was if he/she was on an Angel or Columbia pressing).<br /><br />This shows in the present set. The performances are generally first class and the recordings are all excellent for when they were made. Outstanding of the discs that I've heard so far are the [[ASIN:B00000418W Verdi: Requiem / Quattro Pezzi Sacri (Four Sacred Pieces)]] (Gardiner), [[ASIN:B000E6EH1S Berlioz: Symphonie Fantastique]] (Davis), [[ASIN:B0000060AV Bartók: The Miraculous Mandarin; Hungarian Peasant Songs; Rumanian Folk Dances]] (Fischer) and The Rite of Spring and Tchaikovsky 5th (both by Gergiev) [[ASIN:B00005NIF6 Igor Stravinsky: The Rite of Spring / Alexander Scriabin: The Poem of Ecstasy - Valery Gergiev / Kirov Orchestra]]. But none of the first 20 CDs has been a disappointment.<br /><br />These recordings are highly regarded here in Amazon reviews and they are mostly discontinued (at least in Canada) now that this set is out. Get them here or you're out of luck and you may be \\"time limited\\". The [[ASIN:B005XBA9Y8 Mercury Living Presence Boxed Set]] that I bought just 7 months ago is already out of print and [[ASIN:B005D51II0 The Decca Sound]] is getting challenging to buy already. These sets often seem to have a very limited shelf life.<br /><br />An added bonus of this set is that Philips has added extra material to fill the discs up and, unlike some other sets that I have, the added material is usually an excellent match for the original recording. For example, one of the discs is Tchaikovsky's Suite No.3 for Orchestra (Dorati) and the \\"filler\\" is Suite No.4 (Dorati also). Somehow I hadn't heard either of these pieces before, but enjoyed them both. Another example is the [[ASIN:B000EBD84K Rimsky-Korsakov: Scheherazade]] by Kondrashin. I have the original CD which is only 44 minutes long, but in the set they've added Borodin's Symphony No.2 (Kondrashin also) for another 27 minutes. I'm looking forward to hearing it when I get there.<br /><br />The Verdi Requiem mentioned above shows the lengths Philips has gone to to give value for money in this collection. Originally issued as a two CD set, they've managed to get it onto a single 82 minute disc though without the \\"Four Sacred Songs\\" that the set contained. That's pushing the medium to its limits!<br /><br />At its bargain price, this set was an obvious purchase. My only regret was that I already owned a significant number of the discs.<br /><br />Now if only Philips does a second set (and even a third and a fourth)!<br /><br />Addendum - Since writing the above I've finished listening to the set and, of course, have found some discs that I'm not as enthusiastic about. That's to be expected in a set this size and hasn't made me rethink the 5 I gave it. I have bought a fair number of these large sets (including the two mentioned above) and this is my favourite. Overall, an outstanding set and a bargain.

0316069434|5.0|Oh, Harry Bosch is back! I started Michael Connelly's latest book in the series (#18) - The Black Box - and I tried really, really hard to make it last.....but it was no use.....I finished it in a day. I literally couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Harry is still with the Open-Unsolved Unit of the LAPD. It's the 20th anniversary of the L.A. riots and the Unit has been asked to try and clear some cases from that time period. Harry knows the case he wants to re examine. He worked the streets during that turmoil and was there when Anneke Jespersen's body was found in an alley. The murder of the young journalist was never solved.<br /><br />\\"In the chaos of the moment, the mission was simple; preserve the evidence, document the scene as well and as fast as possible, and collect the dead. Get in and get out. And do it safely. The real investigation would come later. Maybe.\\"<br /><br />Well, that time is now.  With today's capabilities in forensic science, Harry makes a discovery - bullets at the Jespersen scene match other crime scenes - committed after her murder. And Harry is on the trail. \\"Twenty years later, he got another shot at it. And it was a very long shot at that.\\" What he also has is a new lieutenant - one determined to put Harry in his place.<br /><br />This is Harry at his best, under the gun from superiors, eschewing the politicos, running solo, making connections others don't see and pursuing his cases full out. Justice for the victim is his focus. I have such a vivid mental image of Harry as I read - he is one of my favourite detectives.<br /><br />As always, the plotting was intricate. I enjoyed solving the crime along with Harry as he pieced together his case from tenuous leads, intuition and dogged determination.<br /><br />Connelly has given us the softer side of  Harry in the last few books with the addition of his daughter Maddie. While I enjoy Harry having a personal life and storyline, I'm still on the fence about Maddie. But not about the new love interest Hannah - she's got to go. I'm curious as to whether a new female cop introduced in this book will return in future stories. Initially I thought she was just a supporting character, but played a bigger role than I imagined.<br /><br />As always, another great read from Connelly. The downside - we'll have to wait another year for his next book - The Gods of Guilt.<br /><br />\\"The saying is that law enforcement work is ninety-nine per-cent boredom and one percent adrenaline - screaming high intensity moments of life -and- death consequence.\\" The Black Box?

B005I6EU7U|5.0|I bought this cover for my Kindle Fire originally and loved it immediately. Then I upgraded to an iPad Mini and thought I wouldn't be able to use it anymore...I almost sold it with my Fire!  Luckily, however, I tried it on my iPad and although it was very tight and a little hard to get on, it now fits perfectly!  Nothing sticks out and my iPad Mini sits snugly inside.  I'm very happy with it and am so glad I've been able to continue using it!

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|GREAT game for all ages and its alot of fun<br /><br />i downloaded this to my phone has avertisements which is annoying
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|It's hard to find movies that combine action, humor, and charismatic actors. This one hits all the buttons - it's funny, surprising, and suspenseful enough. It even has romance - two of 'em. And something I value - it doesn't go over the top with special effects (there are plenty). That is, the FX don't make you feel like you're a helpless sentient being with sensitive skin who's being thrown into a wood chipper. Thoroughly enjoy this flick.
B00ADYYY50|2.0|If you want to hear someone rap about money for 1 hour, 13 minutes, and 35 seconds then this is the album for you. If not, then stay far far away from this garbage. I should have trusted my instincts after I saw the cover. Gave it 2 stars because he has a few good beats (that should have been given to someone else to make real songs)

B009H5IS1W|4.0|This used to be my favorite show but I do not like the new character that Jeannie Tripplehorn has introcuced.  The story lines continue to be well thought out and interesting.
B000ICXQHE|3.0|Ho hum, Denzel.  Plot's okay but convoluted since it follows Hollywood's formulaic ending, to make protagonist the champion when he's just a New York cop doing his job. Breaking up a bank CEO's longtime connection to Nazi treasure?  Again?  Cut maybe a dozen scenes, added text for clarification would have accelerated the plot and garnered higher praise.  Thinly portrayed is Washington's love interest, and he just doesn't have a foil (not Jody Foster although I liked her character) to propel his actions and words.  Suspend lots of disbelief, doesn't have the ring of verisimilitude aka plausibility.  In fact, Washington's acting persona puts one in mind that the man is thinking about his dinner date or next holiday in Cannes.  Of course, if you're a fan, he can do no wrong.  Can't hold a candle to Philadelphia story or the other subway flick in which he starred.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I loved it! Better than any sequel I've ever read. Thrilling and keeps you on your toes till the very end!
0547884591|4.0|I don't know if it will take that long to write the review but I liked the title so I ran with it. I'm a fan of Ferriss and looking over my shoulder, there is the 4 hour body in its place on the shelf in my office. One thing I have noticed about the way Tim writes is that he seems to go above and beyond no matter what, getting every bang for your buck he can between the first page and the last (virtual or not). This style of writing may not be for everyone as I have gathered from some of the reviews. It is for me though. I look at reading Tim Ferriss books like going on a treasure hunt. While you are looking for one thing that you will eventually find.. up pops something unexpected. I like that. Individual mileage may and always does vary... but that is a good thing.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I cannot wait for the movies to come out on these books! I just hope they hold true to the story line!!!
0385737955|3.0|For the past two years, the creators have been sending a child a month to the maze.  The kids don't know who they are, why they are there, or how to escape.  They grow food, raise animals, cook, clean and run the maze in the hope of escaping.  Maze runners are at an increased risk to be killed by grievers, which primarily appear at night, but can appear in the maze during the day.  Thomas appears, and he is a smug and demanding know it all.  Then Teresa appears, and the maze begins to unravel.<br /><br />While it is a well-written and fast-paced story, the characters were lacking.  It just seemed like any bunch of young boys who are just doing what they have to do in order to survive.  They don't appear to be special, and none of them were very likable.  Then we add in Teresa, who is supposed to be special.  I failed to find what was special.  Sure her presence only heralded the end of the experiment, but she didn't doing anything beyond retaining a couple of memories.  Ya hoo.<br /><br />I also failed to see how surviving showed that someone was smart.  Lucky maybe, but not smart.

B009VB7QQA|4.0|For what it was intended to be, it wasn't half bad.  Of course, this is a genre movie, and it is not without its flaws, but it was entertaining and unique.  With all the same-old-(spit) movies out there, this movie deserves a watch if for nothing more than to see something unique and not some half-(hashed) remake of a movie that wasn't good to begin with.

I probably buy a new pair about every year and a half because the sound always goes out in one ear. I also can't wear ear buds, I have tried many pairs and they won't stay in. These never get in the way, always stay put, have awesome sound, and for the price you can't beat it. It is worth the $10/or less spend every year! Definitely will keep buying these.

0547884591|5.0|I own Tim Ferriss' 4 Hour Work Week and 4 Hour Body audio books but when I heard about all the pictures I decided to buy the hard copy of 4 Hour Chef. Would gladly pay the $20 just for the meta-learning section! Meta-learning breaks down how Tim has made his ridiculous list of accomplishments.  Loved the redneck-section and the cooking section but the meta-learning section was awesome for anyone interested in life hacking/lifestyle design/self improvement.

0547884591|4.0|I'm really enjoying the 4H Chef. It's hard to read even in a dozen sittings, but it isn't meant for a read-through.<br /><br />Tim goes to experts as he curates and elucidates a slew of helpful, informative and interesting secrets about preparing great food, and becoming good at a bunch of things. Things that will surprise you. I've learned a lot of tips and tricks to cooking food better and making it far tastier. I'm doing the slow carb diet which features ingestion of 30 grams of protein within the first 30 minutes of awaking in the morning. My appetite has lessened throughout the day and I'm noticing consistent weight loss. Win!<br /><br />A few weaknesses of the book which I'll mention include it's sheer magnitude (which in some ways is also one of its strengths). Would a series of books have been better? (Admittedly, this may just be personal taste.) And, although Ferriss lays out his methods early on to learning things quickly (he terms \\"meta-learning\\"), and I do find it fascinating, that bit is a little, well, uncooked. The techniques are DSSS (Deconstruction, Selection, Sequencing, Stakes) & CaFE (Compression, Frequency, Encoding) While this system may work for the tenacious polymath, it seems quite unwieldy to me to implement with any considerable success, without a coach of some kind. His real life examples of this sped up learning to achieve (nearly) world-class mastery come off as overviews and are quite sparse on details and specifics.<br /><br />This book comes with A LOT of hype, and even drummed up controversy ...(like being \\"banned\\"...which I'll refrain from getting into here...let Google help you) but, you know what? It delivers. However, it does this not in the way the hype would insinuate it would or could. Tim talks a very big game, maybe over compensating to assure a best-seller, but the book really is good and strangely may suffer for the grandiosity of the antics in the promotional efforts. I'm not a hater. I enjoy what he's done, and love reading his blog as well. Ferriss is entitled to promote in whatever means and ways he pleases. This is just an observation.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, just the completion of such a book is an intrepid work and obviously a labor of love for Ferriss. There are copious pages of useful information, and for the Kindle version, $4.99 was a tremendous bargain. I'm very happy with my purchase.

0547884591|5.0|The Four Hour Chef is another excellent book by Tim Ferriss. I own all three books in the \\"Four Hour\\" trilogy and all have enriched my life. The Four Hour Work Week saved my sanity, The Four Hour Body helped me lose that pernicious weight I spent fifteen years trying to get rid of, and now The Four Hour Chef is teaching me how to be a better cook while teaching me how to be self-reliant, inquisitive, and (most of all) a better learner.<br /><br />Tim's unique blend of humour, insight, and storytelling has made all of his books enjoyable and approachable. This book continues the trend. I know I can't convince the people who are putting one star reviews on here and loudly yelling \\"WORSE BOOK EVAR!\\", they just flip the Bozo Bit for me. If, on the other hand, you are looking for a book that will provide you with some practical skills while teaching you to learn how to quickly pick up others, this is the book for you. And once you've finished this book, go pick up Four Hour Work Week and Four Hour Body if you haven't already.

0547884591|5.0|I don't buy a lot of books. I usually borrow or flip through what the traditional publishing world puts out, and find it of lesser value and greater time suck than free information I can find online.<br /><br />The Four Hour Chef is one of the glowing exceptions where I feel like I got at least 10x the value of what I paid for the book. Simply put, it is one of the most beautifully designed and printed books I've ever seen - and also incredibly practical and interesting. The care given to displaying the dense information visually makes it easy to learn what's being taught. I have already recommended it to many friends and acquaintances, showing it off like a new sports car. They have all been impressed to the same level.<br /><br />Tim, thank you for the hard work you put into this book. There's nothing else like it out there.

I was not one of the fortunate ones who received my iPhone as an upgrade on a long term contract so I paid about $600 for mine. I have dropped it many times and been caught by the sprinklers unexpectedly turning on. If it wasn't for my LifeProof case I would probably be on a flip-phone right now!<br /><br />My only complaint is that my rewards cards will not scan through the case so I still have to carry them all in my wallet. Still a small price to pay, all things considered. I would recommend this to everyone - and be sure to get the charging/ dock adapter when you order the case. You will need it so you might as well go ahead & get it now. I tried cheaper &#34;universal&#34; adapters and they do not work with LifeProof!
B007P6VLRS|5.0|I have always loved the Smashing Pumpkins. My favorite C.D. was the one I had  was the C.D. Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. The music on that C.D. made me so cheerful and happy. With their new C.D. that came out Oceania it is just as great to listen to. All of the songs has an amazing beat the case the C.D. came in looks beautiful on the outside it is blue and has the moon on the inside flap. The song book is hidden in this little pocket that has a satellite on it which I did not expect. Once you take out the C.D. under the plastic holder it has a lunar eclipse  picture that looks awesome.<br />This C.D. was a great buy and worth every single penny. Smashing Pumpkins is amazing I do not care who you are. If you do not like Smashing Pumpkins you definitely have no taste in any rock music. Enough said. This would make a great gift.

Excellent headphoenes and I highly recommend them. You will not be disappointed.

She seems dead pan to me and isn't very interesting, doesn't add much except to maybe look good and that's not what I;m looking for in this series.  I like the action and the suspense, the fight scenes with the zombies.  Hope the writers can keep the show fresh and worth tuning into.

But if you're looking for something a little darker and don't have an issue with getting upset at his decline, then it is an imaginative and good story.

This movie, together with &#34;The Robe&#34; give a view of the early Church that we don't get in movies anymore.  It exemplifies the texts of the Acts of the Apostles and tells a story version of the early church.  It bears witness to two sayings of the early church which explained why it was able to grow so fast despite being constantly persecuted and suppressed.  The two sayings?  &#34;See how they love one another&#34; and Tertullian's &#34;the blood of martyrs is the seed of faith&#34;.

For those who a queasy when it comes to murder movies this one is pretty tame (no blood and guts).
B001UN1KVE|5.0|Laugh out loud funny in 1987 - just as good in 2012. Most people probably know the plot line by now, but if not this is a funny parody of the Star Wars movies. The upgrade to Blu-ray works surprisingly well for a film made in the 80's. If you are thinking you would like to re-visit this funny movie with better audio and video, the price point should convince you. Money well spent.

B0055PGUYU|2.0|I have not read this book.  I received this book in error and did not return it as I should have.

B003ODIZL6|2.0|This book is too hard to search through. Every time I try to flip through the pages, it always skips what I need...
B0041KVW2K|2.0|the pressings of the vinyl in the US have suffered from many defects. like many other buyers, i am now on my second set hoping to find records that are free from problems, like nicks, gashes, no-fill, distortion, finger prints, and off-center spindle holes and labels. the sound of albums that are trouble-free is nice, but the quality from the Rainbo pressings is terribly inconsistent. i may need to return my second box in a search for a quality set. i'm very much looking forward to my preferred Mono mixes next year, but hope that the pressings will have better quality-control. The Beatles tend to want to do things right, and these historic releases need to step up to that hight standard.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game for when you have some time on your hands.  The quick turns are exciting....one false move and the birds are on your tail.  Great game for all ages.
B000002GB4|5.0|just Love Styxx needed it to complete my collection
1451648537|5.0|Not being an Apple person, I really never followed Steve Jobs. However, once his book came out, I got it here and started reading it.<br />Truly, it begins in their garage, creating the APPLE. Whether you like SJ or not, this IS a book not to miss. He was brilliant, and also<br />quite mean and this book shows both sides in detail. May he R.I.P. and I greatly thank ALL who helped him create the products you all have<br />created.

B005LFS3ZS|5.0|Unopened as yet (saved for gift), but certainly well packaged. If LP is unopened, any problems would be manufacturer-related issues.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Let me address the issue with the Kindle version. I just finished the Kindle version and noticed no (or exceedingly rare) issues as far as editing. They seem to have fixed the problems.<br /><br />Now, this is my first foray into the \\"Fantasy/Adventure\\" genre. I've never been one for this type of book and was quite honestly expecting to read a few chapters and walk away. My how I was wrong. This book grips you from the beginning and just doesn't let go. Excellent writing and an excellent story. Very much looking forward to the next.
B009PNQUXO|3.0|this app is ok : but took a while to download and open. I wish it would load faster. i wouls say get this app just because you can search the web. But it is a little slow
B000002GB2|5.0|fantastic album with many great tunes a must have for styx fans I would not hestitate to play this again and again
B006TJXZ30|5.0|Microsoft has step up and their interface is pretty good. They have also eliminated most of the spam. I am now considering to use their services for all my emails.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|Originally I just chanced to tune in on the Saturday night when she debuted a song from that first album on SNL. I was hypnotized and puzzled at the same time. That album was polarizing to the music in crowd I guess. Whatever. This disc is superb. Hard to mesh this lovely voice and exterior to some of this songwriting. The combination seems so improbable but this is a very fine piece of vocal work and song writing. Will watch each album from this siren.
B00A3AYI50|5.0|I enjoyed Phillip's talent from the time I saw his audition. It was very fun to watch the season and then see my favorite artist win. I believe this is a very solid album for any artist to have turned out, especially for his first professional release. Well done, Phillip. Thanks for the great tunes.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|this is the second swivel sweeper I have owned, its a real gem to clean up the kitchen floor, fast over the carpets to pick up little<br />things like cat hair and just shoe traffic.  Got one for christmas for a friend and she loves it.
B0033TJATW|5.0|looked for long time for this i have it on vhs but very satisfied to have found it on dvd great product plays well
B007HACDLK|5.0|This book is a bit different then the other books that Vince Flynn has written about Mitch Rapp.  Mitch gets hurt & suffers & it takes a while for him to get back to his old self.  But never fear-Mitch is still Mitch.  I have read everyone of Mr. Flynn's books, I can not say this is my favorite book; but I read :&#34;The Last Man&#34; on my kindle which means I will re-read it again..  It is not a roller coaster ride as some of the other books but still worth the read.
B005DOKIYG|1.0|My Kindle Fire will not fit into this cover?  The cover is too small.  What's up with this? What a rip off!<br /><br />OOPS.  This cover is not for HP Fire.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I really enjoy all of Vince Flynn's books.  Mitch Rapp is one tough guy.  The &#34;Last Man&#34; is a worthy read.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another great read from Vince Flynn!  Mitch Rapp: American hero!  Wish he was real!  Can't wait until Vince writes his next great thriller!
B0012GMV4O|5.0|is great sounding and i really enjoyed the memories this album brought back fast shipper and great deal and brand new
B00A8ECU24|5.0|awesome and fun. my daughter loves it. :) we play together all the time. its fairly easy...reminds me of farmville kinds but girlie!
B009X01C64|2.0|This cover has what I consider a serious design flaw.  The back cover does not bend.  This means that the screen can only be set at 3 different angles, all of which are too vertical for ease of use.  I cannot type on the screen in any of these angles, nor can I easily see the screen because of the high angle of the screen.  Although I liked the idea of the case allowing the Kindle to be positioned vertically, I returned this product.  I do not recommend it.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I played the original and this is just like that but with better graphics. If your a final fantasy fan then this game is worth the 15 dollars. I hope to see 5,6,7,and 9 come to the kindle as well sometime in the future hint hint wink wink square enix
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Another great read from Kathy Reichs.  Love the TV show, but love your books even more! As always, can't wait until you write your next book!
B003PBB4ME|3.0|great for low to ground smooth panning it gives you ease in holding camcorder nice as a general handle for less camera shake
B007I2BZIE|5.0|It is inspirational that these men are still creating exceptional music after being together for 30+ years. Alex at his best for sure.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great book as always with Follett.  Hope he continues to present time with the characters. Will be watching for the follow-on.
0812974786|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. After looking constantly looking up the foreign religious words, I realized that most of them are in the back of the book! Didn't even think to look. Definitely useful just to flip to the back and check.<br /><br />Although this is the first version I've read, I'd recommend it. Everything seemed to flow well. I didn't notice any inconsistencies that could've been explained by bad translation.Enjoy!
B007HACDLK|4.0|The premise was good, but the written content seemed to be a hurried effort to get the book published. I have read all of his books so far and this one seemed to lack the flow of events being presented in a logcal manner.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Perhaps If I would've brainstormed enough I would've made a better screenplay.<br />Seriously? Crappy foreshadowing on why they went to the experiment planet. No real reason to watch this movie. Waste of $4. is good when there is nothing else to view and it's free.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I think that the angry birds are boring to me cause they only make the same game over and over and they are the same but differrent levels on it that's why I say it is boring
B005F3XV62|5.0|The quality was excellent. Better than what i expected. No complains about the packaging as well. I am happy with the product.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Although I have been convinced for a long time that there is a better place in heaven, this book certainly proves it in my mind!

0142412147|5.0|Three amazing romances by three great authors. I loved it.  A great book to read during winter break or all year long.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|At first I was intrigued and then it just seemed to go no and on, but I decided that I would read them all.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I would definitely recommend this app to anyone who is needing a variety of translations to understand the Word of God with deeper meaning. The book marks and note taking features are great extras and helps study plans, insightful understandings to verses, and references to favorite verses become available
B0053VKP8S|4.0|We use this attached to an AppleTV's optical out jack, to convert the signal to an analog signal for headphones. Works great.<br /><br />Sometimes it loses the connection to the ATV. In those cases, unplugging it and plugging it back in works to fix it. Wish it had a switch to make that a little easier.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|its really good for a calculator. I mean its just a caculator. its that awesome its just a calculator. its good though
B004LWZWGA|4.0|I found this film to be just as my title says a good ending to a great trilogy. Christopher Nolan's trilogy has been my favorite of all the live action Batman movies. That being said I did not enjoy this one as much as Batman Begins or The Dark Knight. As for the DVD itself I got the basic version which is all I wanted I'm not really into commentary and all that stuff the only thing on that end I was disappointed with was the cover itself when compared to the Blu-Ray version it seems kind of lame. But overall I was happy with the product and the movie itself.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I am still reading it and I am just getting to the best part. I am sure this one will be as good as the others.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I bought this DVD because we loved it in the theater. It's a fun family film. Also, since I only paid $3.99 for it, it's going to make a great stocking stuffer and even I am looking forward to watching it again!
B00AE2LJVS|1.0|While it technically is a \\"drama\\" and does have a plot, it is thin and un-compelling. The characters don't make you care about them, and it is fairly predictable and uninteresting. The only thing that keeps your interest are the over-the-top violence scenes (SPOILER ALERT: neck slicing, sadistic tar-and-feathering) which punctuates the film like bad car crashes along a boring drive. About half way through, I could not wait for it to end and felt like I wasted my $4.99 and 2 hours of time. I am not a prude and understand some violence in a film, but not as a substitue for an interesting story to go along with it. What a waste of money on making this film...
B0087YYHZU|5.0|Well, actually my mom bought this movie because she just loves it... and thats all i know, sorry... but, she did say its an awesome movie/ its such a great movie! Also, i think it has gene kelly, this being such the original movie has the best actors and actresses..especially, Gene Kelly :)
B009GESJH2|4.0|Great CD so far.  Did not take to this one as quickly as his last few.  Still a great kid rock cd though!
0547884591|5.0|Another quality book from Tim, who keeps getting better at reinventing the reference tome.  I can cook rather competently and this is still valuable due to approach and thoughtful deconstruction. Get the hard copy for home. (I also have an e-reader version, but that's usually to show people stuff on airplanes)
B006YTTVHO|2.0|Overall , I found this book to be a big  disapointment. The info was very basic and really was only a come-on for the author's products.
B000067QMD|5.0|Use these rings with my avent bottles. Perfect for pumping and work and bringing milk home. No problems with leaking - even when the bag turns over.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Over and over again, Enya's unbelievable voice can rest and refresh us. She has done it again with this CD.
0345803507|4.0|Read these books because I was hearing so much about them.  You would have to be very up tight to be offended by these books.  I enjoyed the story line more than anything.  Kept wondering what was going to happen to the main characters.  Reminded me of a Danielle Steel with some extras.  :-)
1402793375|4.0|Ok, let me start with some minor negatives but PLEASE continue on to the second part. I've read better written history books and at times after going through the chapters some of the facts and figures aren't quite as memorable as say reading a book about a specific incident or concentrating on one tribe/movement. Basically, this book is kind of like an intro to American Indian History so if you want a clearer picture then read this and move on to other books. Also,I read an earlier version but I bet this one with more pictures and maps would be of help so while that was a minor negative for me it looks like it is corrected.<br />But here is why I'm so glad I have read this book and I really wish I read it in middle school or high school. YOU WILL not have a complete picture of American history unless you have read this book or know about the history of the Native people. I've always been a fan of history and had known some Native history, but after reading this book you realize what an important gap, really a massive canyon, is missing in your knowledge of American history unless you know these stories.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|We were never able to watch the DVD of the first season because we were never able to finish the series.  Amazon's DVDs were defective.  We orderred and received two different sets of the first season and they both were scratched, or they hesitated and stopped in the same spots.  We'll try and buy this from someone else, ie, Target, Walmart,  who may have gotten a different cut of the same series.<br />Mary Jo Busby
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I really like this CD. I saw Lady A a few years ago at the San Antonio rodeo. It was before they got popular. I knew then they were going to shoot high on the charts. Their music is very cross over which I like. The heavy old country music is not for me.
B009GESJH2|5.0|I am a huge Kid Rock fan, so was delighted that he had another album...listen to it all the time!
B005C9YZPA|5.0|I bought this for my dad for Christmas.  He loved it.  The unique packaging made it even nicer to give as a gift.  I can't wait to borrow it one day and watch it myself!  :-)
B002436WFI|5.0|I know the story well from the book and audio recording and I think the DVD perfomance catches the right spirit (perhaps not quite as good as Tony Robinson )  J
B005CKPQNE|5.0|'nuff said. What a great series. We streamed these online, which was super-easy especially if you have an internet TV.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Love the originality of the story line. The best part is the writers are keeping the excitement and originality from the First Season into the Second.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Saw this concert in Fresno CA. This DVD of the concert does the live concert justice adding some behind the scenes action. Live it! Love it! Madonna at her best!
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|It took a few times listening to Christina's cd to really like it but I love it now.  Been playing it for a week straight.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|there are a lot of adventure games that leave logic to the imagination, but this is not one of them. often, I found myself wondering what I would need to solve a specific puzzle, and I could often predict how it would work. it never felt like I was clicking at random, hoping for the best, because things worked the way they should: levers pulled, belts turned pulleys, and even the magical elements tied into a solid, realistic world. the graphics in this game were gorgeous, and rarely felt out of place. it was obvious that a lot of care went into the design of this game, both technically, in the programming and puzzle design, and artistically, in the graphics and sounds. an all-around enjoyable experience. my only critique is the finale, where I felt I deserved a more visual payoff for the work I had put into my adventure, but even that kia a fairly minor complaint, as the game carried itself so well that viewing the various sights was quite a bit of payoff to begin with.
B004GJVI5C|4.0|Hardened Boston drama. Ben Affleck at his directorial best. Definitely recommend, but don't get this if you're looking for something light.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have enjoyed may of the books by Grisham. This one has not disappointed me so far. Half way thru and I can't get over the joy I feel for the central character.
1439153663|5.0|Loved this one!  I enjoyed the historical twist--had no idea there were slaves from Ireland.  I hope they make this into a movie.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|This was an incredible story. Morgenstren brought this story of love and magic to life. Not only the characters who were magnificently fleshed out, but the story was so 'visual.' The world she invented in was one you could step right into. I was mesmerized.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you like period drama, this is a must see. Very clever characters and beautiful cinematography. Not to mention all the intertwined dramas.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|This book was recommended by a cousin who has cancer and we are of an age where our parents are failing or have died. It was especially meaningful in this context. The message about living life fully was clear, but as a piece of literature it was sometimes confusing. I was an English teacher for 24 years and ought to know.
0385344228|4.0|Good book.  The dad was a little unrealistic to me.  Not much of an investigator. My book club had a great discussion though.
B0091LS07E|4.0|Great CD and classic Alicia Keys.  Not sure it is as great as her last one but I still really like it.
0061733199|5.0|My favorite part of this book is it has an entire section of edible plants with pictures and what toxic ones look like. Could be extremely helpful.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Good read.  Bit predicitable for Vince.  But had some good twists.  Ended quickly and with another book on the horizon?
B008SVFX96|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I love Richie...more than Jon, sorry....and I have his first 2 solos and love them from end to end but this one...dunno....there are the great songs on it, ones that Ill listen to over and over again but others, they didn't need to be there, almost like he was trying to hard to fill a CD...but hey that's just me....being honest about one of my faves :)
B007I2BZIE|4.0|I feared Rush's creative days were over when I heard \\"Test for Echo\\" in 1997, and especially \\"Vapor Trails\\" back in 2001, which is in my opinion the worst Rush album ever ! However they had a decent comeback with \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" in 2007, which turned out to be a 'Far Cry' better than its predecessor. I think Clockwork is their best work in a long time, at least since Roll the bones back in '91. The album quickly grew on me and I think it shows that the power trio, now pushing 60, can still put out a rocker. The only fault I find with this release is \\"Wish them well\\", the next to the last track. It is a sleeper reminiscent of \\"At the speed of love\\" and \\"Carve away the stone\\", two Rush songs that never should have been. I would have to say \\"The Garden\\" could easily be classified as one of the band's top 10 best songs ever.
B008J34466|5.0|Pink is such a talented artist.  Not only is she a great performer but her music is great to listen to in the car.  Love it!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I love the Sherlock series and this was just the best. Now I have both seasons and this was better than the first!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|GREAT package for fans of the franchise.  Original theatrical and director's/specialty cuts of each film, lots of extras, and a first-rate job of updating both video and audio for the new formatting.  Kudos!
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was an interesting read and did keep you guessing nearly all the time.  I was not overewhelmed with it but did find it interesting.  Think it did maake us think about not jumping to conclusions.
B005FISBV2|5.0|Is there anyone else who can perform murder so meticulously than dexter?  Schizophrenics make the perfect serial killers. I have never read the books but I have all of the seasons on dvd or blue ray, I especially love the evolution of deborah dexters sister the paralells between deb and dex are just too freaky. Michael C Hall has done a tremendous job as executive producer as well.
B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie keeps getting better.  Hard to believe she was once the shy little girl off of american idol.  I am not big into country music but I love her music.  Would recommend!
B003JBHQP4|5.0|This little thing was the answer to all my problems . Takes any size disc. so you can look at your photos.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I don''t know anyone else who has read this book yet, and I have been desperately searching for someone I could discuss it with.  It's that kind of book, the kind that inhabits your mind long after you've turned the last page.  When I read the last page, I immediately went back to page one and began reading again, to make sure, knowing what I did now, that I hadn't missed anything (and of course, I had).  This is the kind of book you can read in your 20's and get one (completely valid) message, read in your 30's and get a different (and also completely valid) message, and so on.  Aside from the allegory and the life lessons, which are there for the taking, it's a really good story.

B004TI5N38|4.0|I like this character, all military logic, but baldaccis characters need a little bit more &#34;pizzazz&#34; or flaw but its not just him that suffers from this alot of writers do too. But this book is a great read because it introduces a new kind of investigator the military investigative branch.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele's CD is amazing.  I could listen to every song on the CD over and over.  My niece wanted it and bought a copy for her too.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I love this series, and I was so sad when it ended.  But this book seemed more rushed then her first two.  I personally think this should had been broken up into 2 books, just not the attention to detail I had come to expect.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|its an ok game, people say that it is SO addictive and i personslly think that it is do easy that its on the edge of being boring.....idk, its free so wat the heck, but if it cost any money it wouldnt be wort it.
B005LAII62|3.0|Decently entertaining with moments of honest hilarity, but falters using an assembly-line script that's been lifted more times than a pair of public gym dumbbells.<br /><br />Additionally, appropriating the now satirical trope from '[[ASIN:B00004BZIY The Sixth Sense]]', young Norman Babcock sees dead people. Well, dead everything, if you include pets and other animals. Pretty sad state of affairs when a once iconic shocker becomes a B-Movie and derivative TV show staple, itself a pathos-laden testament. Unfortunately, this premise also leads to several rather troubling questions which I won't address here.<br /><br />Norman lives in Massachusetts, a rather notorious state whose past includes the Salem Witch Trials. And it's that history where this tale begins.<br /><br />Involuntarily designated a town freak, he has to contend with just about every indignity imaginable for someone so young, including the disappointment from his parents who consider him strange beyond your typical quirky kid. Reason? Because he doesn't deny his visions. Norman intentionally chooses to speak with the deceased and only rarely interacts with the living. Such a choice pretty much makes him a very lonely little guy.<br /><br />And so life, and un-life, goes on.<br /><br />Until the one day his even more eccentric and infinitely scarier uncle insists on a meeting. He has two things he has to tell Norman - one a warning, the other a revelation. Things are about to change in ways that even the ostracized young man couldn't have imagined, becoming even more bizarre and terrifying.<br /><br />One step removed from the cracker farm, Uncle Prenderghast explains to his nephew that it is their family's terrible burden and moral responsibility to save the town. With the unwanted ability to see the departed, in their bloodline resides the only power keeping their town's most infamous resident - Agatha The Witch - from resurrecting a legion of the damned and inflicting her revenge against the townfolk who burned her at the stake.<br /><br />But is that what really happened?<br /><br />Norman has figure out the truth before Aggie destroys the town and everyone in it.<br /><br />One minor knock and perhaps it's just me, but save for Norman himself, I don't like the way characters were designed. They seem misshapen and unappealing. Not sure if that makes sense. Obviously these are caricatures, I get that. But look at '[[ASIN:B0034G4OYA Hotel Transylvania]]' or '[[ASIN:B00304E5NG Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs]]' - one can see their cartoon origins as well, but they're still visually appealing.<br /><br />Again, decently fun, if formulaic.k who burned her at the stake.<br /><br />But is that what really happened?<br /><br />Norman has figure out the truth before Aggie destroys the town and everyone in it.<br /><br />One minor knock and perhaps it's just me, but save for Norman himself, I don't like the way characters were designed.

B008XNZMOU|5.0|Taylor Swift is such a talented young woman.  This CD is great.  I am not a huge country fan so I love how she is starting to incorporate pop music into her songs.  Love it!
B00AFEY354|5.0|Imagine yourself on the eve of your first day of high school. If you'd prefer not to, I get it, believe me. What if you'd just been released from the hospital? Do you really think you could rebound from that?<br /><br />  Charlie (played by Logan Lerman), is a quiet, introspective teenager who has recently suffered a setback, the full nature of which we're not informed of, and is about to start his freshman year of high school. The only friend he makes on his first day is his English teacher, Bill Anderson (played by Paul Rudd). Rather than worry his parents, (played by Dylan McDermott and Kate Walsh) Charlie gives the typical, one-syllable description of his first day of high school. Time passes and Charlie becomes friends with step-siblings Sam and Patrick. Sam (played by former Harry Potter actress Emma Watson) is an outgoing senior dating a college guy and her step-brother Patrick (played by Ezra Miller) is a flamboyant underachiever with a great sense of humor. They attend a football game together and follow that with a visit to a diner before driving Charlie home. The next function they attend as a group is a party where Charlie, unknowingly, ingests a pot brownie. It is during this moment of drug-fueled confidence that Charlie reveals to Sam the fact that he lost a friend to suicide one year ago. After quietly relaying that fact to Patrick, he and Sam both decide then and there that Charlie should become a full-fledged member of their group. Moments later, Charlie bears witness to a romantic encounter between Patrick and his closeted boyfriend, star football player Brad (played by Johnny Simmons). They leave the party, go for a drive, and hear a song that inspires Sam to stand in the bed of the pickup truck and stretch out her arms as they drive through a tunnel. This is when Charlie first develops romantic feelings for Sam which she is completely unaware of.<br /><br />  There's a lot to like about this film. Miller and Watson's characters are both very endearing and their decision to adopt fellow outcast Charlie is a moment that brings hope for the character and life in general. There are elements I believe the film could do without. Examples include the one-sided relationship between two of the characters and the references to The Rocky Horror Picture Show, which never resonated with me the way it seems to with others. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it greatly and encourage others to see it at their earliest possible convenience.aring and their decision to adopt fellow outcast Charlie is a moment that brings hope for the character and life in general.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I bought and read this book after seeing the movie, so glad I did.  Although I enjoyed the movie, the book was better.  Read it in a matter of days, and had the whole series read in weeks.

B009MO5E10|4.0|Action-thriller made watchable by a very personable Joseph Gordon Levitt, whose confident presence bolsters the plain unadorned screenplay.<br /><br />Not as freshly revealing as its [[ASIN:B00006S4O5 Kevin Bacon predecessor]], but superior to many others cut from the same or similar bit of creative cloth.<br /><br />Bike messengers, while seemingly an anachronism displaced from history, is in fact a cottage industry that survived the digital revolution. Despite email, secure servers and PDFs - there are still things that require point-to-point hand delivery. Legal documents for the most part, but includes many other items that cannot wait or be trusted to the mail service. Primarily employing young people who live for speed - the premium rush - they skillfully dodge and wind their way through New York City's notoriously congested traffic; and are the go-to service when it absolutely has to get there without delay.<br /><br />Levitt plays Wiley, as in the funny toon coyote, and is quite possibly the best messenger currently rolling on two wheels. He's certainly the most daring. To the admiration of some, to the jealous chagrin of others: The young man doesn't utilize a brake system. His bike is two wheels and an alloy frame. That's it. He never stops.<br /><br />Chosen by an old friend from college to make a very special delivery. One that has terrible ramifications should he fail his assignment.<br /><br />And seeing to it that he does fail is a desperate and dirty cop. Neck deep into the Tongs, cold-blooded and ruthless Chinese gangs with ties back to the old country, he needs what the delivery dude is carrying and is willing to break every law and every bone in Wiley's body to get it.<br /><br />As the cop and Wiley employ increasingly clever and viciously improvised tactics from their particular bag of tricks - the stakes of their street battle becomes higher and more dangerous. People start to get hurt. The pair pull out all the stops when it becomes clear that blood will flow regardless of the outcome.<br /><br />JGL is certainly making a splash these past two years, headlining in no less than five major productions - a sure sign that Hollywood is prepping him for much bigger things.<br /><br />Good.<br /><br />Looking forward to seeing more of the actor.<br /><br />Movie Notes:<br /><br />- One of a small handful of films that mentions the underground Hawala remittance system. Although frowned upon by the US government, is one of the most widely accepted money transfer processes used around the globe. Estimates, and there aren't any hard numbers, generally put the value at more than half-a-trillion dollars a year exchanging hands through what is essentially an honor system.<br /><br />- I see from IMDb's listing that JGL's character is listed as \\"Wilee\\". But since I see and hear that as Willie, I'm going with the official name of the funny injury-prone predator.blood will flow regardless of the outcome.<br /><br />JGL is certainly making a splash these past two years, headlining in no less than five major productions - a sure sign that Hollywood is prepping him for much bigger things.<br /><br />Good.<br /><br />Looking forward to seeing more of the actor.<br /><br />Movie Notes:<br /><br />- One of a small handful of films that mentions the underground Hawala remittance system.

B008RZF1UO|5.0|Amazing product, great quality, and prompt shipping.  I absolutely love it! I don't know why, but it even smelled good when it arrived.  Brilliant album in itself, but the story, poster, and instrumental album make it that much better.

B005IQZB14|5.0|Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail by Cheryl Strayed 5/5 stars<br /><br />I haven't fallen in love with an author since I read The Great Gatsby my freshman year of high school. Cheryl Strayed changed all that for me. Don't mistake me, I'm still head over heels for Mr. Fitzgerald and am anxiously awaiting Baz Luhrman's version of the classic novel. But Cheryl Strayed is a completely different kind of love - the kind of love that inspires you to do big, brave things, like hike the Pacific Crest Trail (Relax! I won't do it alone. That's just dumb.)<br /><br />I picked Wild for the book club I belong to and then there was mass confusion and nobody read it. Luckily, we pushed it to January's selection. I can't escape this book. It's stayed with me since I finished reading it a week ago. Books don't stay with me. Ever. It's not that I don't enjoy books. I do. I just don't retain what I read. I never have.<br /><br />Wild is a memoir that tells the story of Cheryl Strayed, who after losing her mother to cancer and divorcing her husband, decides to hike the Pacific Crest Trail. She sets out with a huge backpack she calls Monster, sends herself packages along the way, and gets back to nature. She encounters animals, people, and manifestations of her mother along the way. She admits what she's doing is crazy, but pushes on, despite the many obstacles in her way:<br /><br />At which point, at long last, there was the actual doing it, quickly followed by the grim realization of what it meant to do it, followed by the decision to quit doing it because it was absurd and pointless and ridiculously difficult and far more than I expected doing it would be and I was profoundly unprepared to do it.<br /><br />There were moments during this book where I was downright anxious, waiting to see what would happen. There were times she considered quitting and I held my breath for a few pages waiting to see what she'd decide to do. She never gave up, and that's a lesson we can all take away from this book: never give up. Life is a marathon, not a sprint.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away in my review, but this is one powerful little book. I don't usually re-read books, but I'm keeping this one. Strayed has written two other books that I'm hoping to read.<br /><br />If you've read Wild, what did you think? Would you do a hike like Cheryl did?<br /><br />Disclaimer: I obtained this book from Amazon. It's now in my personal library. I was not compensated for my review and all opinions are my own.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This is an excellent case for your Kindle.  I chose it based on the demo I found online and have not regretted my purchase.  And it was less expensive than many of the others I've seen.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read this book in like a week, I couldn't put it down.  Glad I got to read the book brfore the movie.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I really enjoyed this book but the ending was disappointing. If I say more I'll spoil the book. I read this book quickly.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Oh there are so many good things about this book. First off.... You fall in love with the characters.They are so down to earth and fun. Conner is a dream come true. What woman wouldn't fall in love in with him? He has it all...Looks,Money,Great Job,Personality and the best humor ever! Totally loved him. And Megan... She is Fun,Beautiful, Great Smile and fits right into Conner's life. They are perfect together.<br /><br /> The love scenes leaves you breathless.Mira knows how to make a steamy love scene and keep the readers wanting more.I loved this story from the start. The only thing I didn't like about it was.... It had an ending! Hahaha... But every good story must end somewhere right? Kudo's to Mira Lyn Kelly on such an awesome job!! Such a fun story!
B009AP2G26|5.0|love all the song, it would of been nice if more songs where on this cd. glee lovers will like it
B008JGSM6G|5.0|works great on my Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 - there are night when I just can't stop trying to get the next puzzle solved
B008U7ZPHS|4.0|I have read all of Rick Riordan's works in last few months (Percy Jackson series), Kane Chronicles and the Heroes of Olympus. After reading the first two books of Heroes of Olympus, I was keenly awaiting this book. Since, a print version was not available in India, I went for the kindle ebook. I must say that the book is good and I finished it with in two days. (I must point out that a I am  a practicing surgeon and read only part time). Overall, Rick Riordan has been doing much better in the Heroes of Olympus series than the Percy Jackson series. I recommend this book to fans of fantasy and mythology. Looking forward to the next one too.
B007SSEBCU|3.0|I was expecting the movie to be more about her time as the Prime Minister, however much of the movie is focused on here failing mental state which was kind of sad.  As usual Meryl Streep is phenomenal.
B0095R64AO|5.0|the plot was a little expected but was tottaly fun to watch. chick flick movie. totally recommended for fun people
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have really enjoyed all of Vince Flynn's books.  I just started reading The Last Man & this one is no exception.
B0041SGYVQ|4.0|I enjoy reading more than most people but I often have a hard time getting through Jane Austen's written work.  This book-turned-TV-series (although it felt very much like a rather long movie when watched back-to-back) gave me a much better grasp of the characters and the culture of the setting.  Mr. Knightly was perfect and you'll definitely laugh with Emma and cringe at her mistakes.<br /><br />Very wonderful show.
