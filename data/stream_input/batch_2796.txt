B000OZ0NXA|4.0|jack reacher is another rambo, which kills before asking questions and feels better to be left alone. if you like rambo, you'd like jack.
B006W0QR1S|4.0|Good action flick with decent story line. Acting was very good. I would have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.
B00DGXGUSY|5.0|After their last album was a little bit disappointing in most of the tracks, Deceiver of the Gods is an awesome return to the Amon Amarth that I fell in love with.
B009NQZVKG|3.0|If you like the other Sigma novels you will enjoy this one as well. Nothing earth shattering, but a fun ready. Liked some of the character development. I would recommend.
B008XG1X18|4.0|My only suggestion is for the app's navigation buttons to be more intuitive. Clean, visually appealing app. It's very addictive and fun to use.
B000I3UAJ0|5.0|Perhaps the best star trek film of all.  The characters are all in decent physical shape, believably unreplaced by an able-bodied younger crew.  The directors used their imagination on this film, big-time, to present a sci-fi with ginormous proportions.
B00338QENI|5.0|The auther was so sensitive and caring.<br />Life was so hard for Henrietta's family, but she wrote respectfully.  I cried so much, but I'm thankful someone cared enough to document here life.
B00CXAAG6I|4.0|Enjoyed every page.  My wife could not stop laughing.  Good humor . I would have given it a 5 had it been longer.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|This novel speaks of the juxtaposition  of race we Africans encounter in the Western countries we choose to reside in.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game I enjoy playing it. Makes you think, and challenges you. Keeps you on your toes. Went ahead and paid for the app
B0013ND30M|1.0|I've been meaning to contact Amazon to figure out what I need to do to return this movie.  I have not had the time.  However, this movie was brand new but would play half way and freeze.  There are no scratches, it just stops.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I love this game,it's fun and there are always coming up with new dragons to breed, I find myself playing all the time.
B002BFBAWO|5.0|Reading through all of the comments I thought it'd just be decent. But I loved it. I felt like I was falling for K Stewart.. WHAT? Great acting, loved every part of it. It was like reliving high school. Just really surprised at how much I liked it. Really good movie.
B001A3AA0G|4.0|I heard Fleet Foxes by accident - Winter Hymnal it was- on a drama podcast. I had to search for the song based on some of the lyrics I could remember. I couldn't resist and purchased the entire album and another beside. I constantly enjoy listening and recommend them.
B0091REZMW|1.0|this game seemed like they were trying to sell u more stuff than just let you enjoy playing the game. I uninstalled it within 5 minutes.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Grisham does it again! I love how he can make \\"bad guys\\" heroes,lovable characters, that you want to see get away with the crime. A fast paced novel that glues you to the edge of your seat, keeps you up all night, trying to figure out who the real bad guy is .Grisham is one of the best writers, well worth time spent reading!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoy this game. My four year old and I both love it! Great for any age! It is constantly updated which keeps the game fresh.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I am an older lady (63 years young) who loves to play games. In fact I own a play station2,as well as a PSI. I prefer easy games without violence, enjoy strategy games and the older games from the days of Atari. Love it and ask you to give it a try.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|excellent game very addicting. cannot stop playing. perfect for just sitting around with nothing else to do. I give this game two big thumbs up.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Great read.<br />Keeps you guessing.  Liked the way she told the story from a variety of perspectives. Great ending. ENJOY
B0092SQ5EG|4.0|These types of movies usually make me realize how \\"human\\" these celebrities are in real life. They have a \\"character\\" they play for the fans but are just fun living down to earth people outside of the spotlight.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Quality is great on these, and you can't ask for a better collection!  Price is amazing too.  $30 is cheap for what you're getting.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|The controls are nice and very easy to use. The game concept is fun and easy to understand. It is a good time waster. Worth the 3 dollars.
B009NNG202|5.0|This is wonderful film with a brilliant cast.  I was amazed by the degree I found myself sympathizing with a monstrous serial killer, with a total detachment for other humans.  I have no doubt I could watch this again and again and still glean more nuance with each watching.  I certainly recommend this masterpiece.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I loved the first book and am really happy with the second. I liked how this book focused not only on the selection itself but the history of the country and how everything came to be! Overall amazing!
B001NLL93W|4.0|I liked the book,  but a lot of the things were predictable, which add it dull. I could have thought of a ton of wishes that could have helped more people when Clark was with the angel. Like:<br /><br />· Bring back all the people who died because of Valentine. Ask their spirit if they want to come back first though
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My boyfriend and I love playing this game!! Not hard or easy, just enough to keep you playing! I suggest it for anyone :)
B005OUHOLY|5.0|As an artist, if you are entrapped by your fears and anxieties, then this book is for you...thank you Kenny Werner!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like this app. It is very convenient. I love that it can be set to show info tight from my kindle drop-down menu. And it gives weather alerts as well. The only minor dislike is that it can be a little confusing at first. And can be a challenge to quickly get the future info u want.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is an incredible read, it sucks you in during the first chapter and never let's you go. The amount of detail put into the book is astonishing I highly recommend this book to anyone it is just so good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is  amazing it is auditing I love it l play it all the time<br />I hope you by it.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|This is the perfect companion to the Kindle Fire HD.  Perfect for kids and adults with no fingerprints left behind.  Love it!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book is amazing, it will play with your sense of reality while also providing an adventure. I can't wait until Ransom Rigg's next book in this series comes out.
B007MD2RHC|5.0|Having enjoyed listening regularly to my prized Two Steps From Hell &#34;Invincible&#34; cd, I was excited and intrigued to find this album apparently done as a special solo project by Thomas Bergersen. I have not been disappointed. The music has all the sweeping orchestral grandeur of Invincible, with more emphasis on vocals. Unlike Invincible, which has plenty of escape-from-evil/chase type sequences, Illusions has more of a 'motivational-epic' feel with interludes of beauty and even tenderness, giving the listener the sense of embarking on a heroic quest. Definitely an indispensable addition to the cd library right alongside Invincible.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great movie. cant wait to see part 2 , hope its a good as the first one. would recommend it
B009H7SCMA|4.0|My goodness! What a cricket game! Gabriella and Jim, with the help of a couple of other characters, make this one innings of cricket a downright hoot! Talk about the fantasies of young men! Here it is played out on the sports arena - with - how shall I put this delicately - tongue in cheek!<br />If you like erotica, mixed with a double dealing of cricket inuenndos and what we expect of the upper class - you'll love this! What a romp!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|This movie is beyond my expectations which were really really high to begin with.  I recommend this movie to everyone whether you think you would like it or not.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|My granddaughter and I play this nearly every day. It's great fun! She's 5 and plays on her own or we play together. Thanks for a fun game.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|I enjoy switching to this after playing Scrabble for a change.  But after you do several of the games it is not very challenging.  But still it is fun to play with.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|For a free game, I really like it.  It was a little hard to adjust to the way you shoot but I think that's because I was used to a different game.  It's really fun though.
159102594X|4.0|I loved it. It's the kind of brilliant book that Kissinger would write if he turned to fiction to include his insightful analysis, track-record of war crimes and other atrocities, and his Darth Vader-like literary voice, all in one book.
B009QW7YEI|5.0|Great Bond movie. Brosnon always played a great Bond. I recommend this movie. I wish he stuck around to make a few more.
B0080R3PSE|5.0|Seemed to work pretty well for my daughter, who gave birth to her first baby in 4.5 hours of hard, but natural labor.  She thinks the techniques did help her relax and go with the pains.  I would recommend anyone give it a try.
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|I Love It I Love It I Love It I Love It I Love It I Love It  great, awesome<br />I would buy it again, from the same Buyer
B005LAIIMG|3.0|What would it be like if a major Hollywood studio makes a big-budget zombie movie with an A-list star? The answer is \\"World War Z\\" starring Brad Pitt as a former UN investigator trying to find a way to save his family and the world, too. This is a zombie movie without gore and flesh-eating. You may call it the world's least gory zombie movie, or the most family-friendly zombie picture.<br /><br />I haven't read the original book by Max Brooks, but I imagine the source material is pretty different from what I saw on screen. The film is filled with choppily edited action set-pieces involving cars, helicopters and an airplane, that are decent but not special. Anyone who has seen \\"Quantum of Solace\\" knows that Marc Forster, who did a great job in \\"Finding Neverland,\\" is not the right choice for directing action scenes.<br /><br />Anyway, it is obvious that Forster attempts to turn the familiar zombie movie conventions into something different with social and political commentaries (the high walls in Israel in the mid-section action sequence is a good example). Unfortunately, his attempts to address deeper issues are at best feeble, easily overshadowed by CGI-enhanced action scenes that are fun to watch, but ultimately forgettable.<br /><br />And action scenes. Swarms of zombies running wild in the streets or climbing up the wall are at first impressive, but then become a bit dull. Some scenes are physically too incredible, even by the standards of mindless entertainment, undermining whatever serious subtexts (if any) you may read in the apocalyptic tale.<br /><br />In short, \\"World War Z\\" is a new spin on a zombie genre - a summer blockbuster zombie movie, which means, ironically, a zombie movie that doesn't bite. This is an enjoyable ride, to be sure, but you may also feel there's something missing in it.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Awesome movie. Great quality and sound. Loved the story and action would watch again. Would definitely recommend. Whole family enjoyed it.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Very seldom do I  find a book that I can't put down.  This was such a page turner.  I really cared about the characters and simply had to find out that all ended we'll with them.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I like that you can access it from mutable devices, it used to be a straight forward email.  Now they have adds galore that constantly flash you while you are trying to read your email.  They have gotten way to commercial.
0525478817|3.0|I really liked the way it was written.  I just did not love the characters too much - I know that sounds horrible to say.  But even if you take the cancer away they are too pretentious.  I wanted to really like the book because I heard good things about it.  Maybe I am not the demographic being that it is a YA novel.  It is just missing something...
B003VPWXRO|5.0|Definitely worth reading. Especially if you or someone you know has struggled with eating disorders. The story is unexpected and interesting. I read it in a couple days.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|The very best trilogy I bought This year. A must for the true sci fi fan. Get it quick before it is too late.
B006JPS1OM|1.0|The game is addicting as hell, but unfortunatly it gets stuck  at leval 9..... i want My Money Back!!!!!! Khjvkhhcuyc urge heredadas ju bikini :-)
B008JFUO0Y|3.0|Hearing about \\"Evil Dead\\" getting a remake over the past few years has caused quite a few groans in the horror community, but upon its unveiling it turned out not to be as needless of a remake (or reboot, or re-imagining, or whatever the hip \\"re\\" term is these days) as we all thought it would be.  This new take on \\"Evil Dead\\" has the gut-churning gore and relentless sense of dread that made Sam Raimi's original classic so good in the first place, which in itself is no small task.  That being said, where this new \\"Evil Dead\\" fails is its lack of black humor.  Even though the original \\"Evil Dead\\" was straight up horror in comparison to its lesser-serious sequels, it still had a bit of self-referential gallows humor, and here it's sadly lacking.  The cast is game enough, but the film's would be simple-story (five friends in a cabin, ridiculously horrible things happen thanks to the Book of the Dead) becomes just another horrible event due to stupid people doing stupid things.  Still, you'll never be bored with this new \\"Evil Dead\\", and it's practical effects work is brilliant and nasty to behold.  Make sure you watch until after the credits to see a familiar face, which in itself offers some hope for the future.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|This is the first movie I watched on my Kindle Fire HD.  The first thing I noticed was the 3D effect; I don't know if it was the movie or the Kindle screen but it was impressive.  The story line of the movie was also pretty good, you had to wait till close the the end to understand the story line and it still left a few questions.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|My niece put this on her Christmas list. I ordered it for her, and she enjoys this movie very much as she watches it over and over again. She is a big Harry Potter fan.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|LinkedIn has been a good way to keep in touch with friends from former workplaces. Not so much for finding new work though.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app updates temperatures and weather conditions, and warnings like pending severe thunderstorms also sound a tone. Very handy when outdoors.
B00BHF9SHS|5.0|It took a second listen to get used to it, but I now love this disk. Long-time fans should be happy.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I just stumbled across this and Dave Grohl's name caught my eye.  I scanned the description and saw names like Trent Reznor and Paul McCartney and had to watch it.  So glad I did!  I learned a lot about the history of recording.  This was so interesting and entertaining...and had some great music!
B003XF1OJK|5.0|I never played the game but always wanted to know the story so I picked up this book and it is amazing!!!!! I love this book and couldn't put it down. The writing was great and you didn't have to know about halo games to appreciate this book. :D
B004VYYA2K|5.0|My granddaughter loves this. It is also great to put all the barbies and other dolls in it and put away.
B00AEBB8BA|5.0|Great film.  Love Mark Wahlberg in it.  Gives you great info on what our government is capable of.  I think everyone should watch this.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|I like this game. Some levels are more challenging than others but it is a good beginning logic puzzle game for novices.
B002WN35DC|5.0|DIOS nos da un chance de estar aqui en este mundo y no somos capaces de apreciar las cosas bellas que en el existen....les recomiendo el Principito es fabuloso...
B009JZWO3I|5.0|We have watched season 1.2.3 and 4 and started over again and are in season two.  Very entertaining and fantastic acting
B009R659L8|5.0|I love all of Mary Higgins Clark's books.  I especially like the shorter chapters the way she writes her books.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Looking forward to more levels. Fun to play with the whole family.  Can not wait to play some more floors.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|The Jurassic Park Builder is just that. You get to design and manage your own dinosaur park. It is good fun with some cool features.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book is epic! A should read by all, but especially today's &#34;Christians&#34;. An unvarnished history of the Christian movement.
B001JI72AI|5.0|My husband has been obsessed with space lately, so we decided to rent this movie. It's a great movie based off true events, a good reminder of the real life dangers that people face when testing new technologies. I enjoyed all the actors, they played their roles very well!<br /><br />We streamed Amazon Instant Video on our PS3 over wifi. The quality was very good, it loaded well. There was one time where it took awhile to buffer after we paused it, but other than that, streaming was very smooth.
B00B9366VO|5.0|This documentary traces the history of a custom-made recording mixing board and the studio it was based in, and the classic albums & artists (old & new) that were recorded with it, first at the Sound City studio in California, then in Dave Grohl's studio.<br /><br />Very interesting doc for any rock music fan, and the new songs recorded for the soundtrack with such varied musicians as Paul McCartney, Lee Ving, Josh Homme, Rick Springfield and Stevie Nicks sound great!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love. it the best there is. give Mr sum more cheats... hello anyone out therre give us some more cheats
0307476073|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I thought Cheryl shared her experience beautifully. I don't want to hike the Pacific Crest Trail though. Definitely not alone.
0439023513|5.0|I recommend this to all ages. This is the best book in the series. A lot of unexpected turns and events.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I find it an interesting view into lives of the class sensitive society of twentieth century England.  I particularly am enjoying the rift that Tom's Catholicism is causing with the family.
B008NCSZQ8|2.0|Great film if you're 14 years old. Everything about this film came across as catering to the lowest denominator. I felt my eyes glaze over and could barely pay attention. Meh.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|The story is ok but please, have some more imagination. Every few chapters a hero goes into a hopeless battle and get's almost killed but is rescued at the last minute by a friend. Also every book in the series or more than once in each book one of the main characters falls heads over heels in love at first site. The same thing repeats over and over again in the various books of the series.
B007V4LBLU|5.0|wasn't expecting the actors to be so involved in their roles. the whole thing was pretty brutal but if you can handle it, it's quite an entertaining movie
B0068THAGY|5.0|liked it a lot, very entertaining, had me on the edge of my seat the whole time and not predictable or over exaggerated like so many movies now a days.
B0074YVW1G|2.0|Didn't find too much of value in this book. A repetitive read in many parts and certainly didn't finish reading it as it got extremely boring
B00AM7E4LM|5.0|Not only does this include some good theory and practical applications but it is a fairly interesting read. Also helpful in challenging some assumptions about whether you need adequate levels of skill or actual mastery for some things.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|In aggregate, it's quite harmless and charming, and there are several funny moments. It's not ET, but it's worth watching.
B003KK6GJQ|5.0|I loved this book.  I love how Jodi Picoult writes from all the different characters points of view.  Total page turner!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This was the first book I have read by Jodi Picoult and I loved it.  I love the way she writes and the book is from a number of different perspectives.  You really understand what each character is thinking about an event - helps get much more in their heads than the whole book from only 1 characters perspective.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is easy to understand and very addictive. Fun to play alone. One of the best free match 3 games.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved every page. I enjoyed the vivid imagery. I really loved the interwoven story lines and the resilience of a bonded family.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I was smiling from the start to the finish of this feel-good book. Constant surprises keep the reader engaged, as the characters stumble from one impossible idea to another, accomplishing everything with hilarious success. A mystery, comedy, drama and action novel all in one, yet it is really about feelings and romance!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Great game to pass the time with while in Dr 's office or just standing in line. Love the challenge.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I was assigned this book for my eighth grade summer reading. I thought this was a great book with a great lesson.
0142000671|5.0|Summer reading for my son. Nothing surprising here. It's a good book. Required reading- he didn't get to choose, but he seems to like it anyway.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|At first, I thought I would be watching another movie about the successes of an artist. To my surprise, this was so much more than that. This movie was an inspiration, a message of never giving up on your dreams and always remaining true to yourself. Katy remained true to herself, despite the rejections, and it paid off in the end. I cried as I watched her heartbreak. To allow the cameras to film her, especially in her most vulnerable moments, took a lot of courage. My favorite part was watching her interaction with her fans and with her co-workers. She treated everyone like a friend. This young lady is quite admirable, showing what it is to rise to the top, but remembering where she came from and how she got there. Her professionalism in the face of her own personal troubles showed her strength of character and her dedication to her career and her fans. Truly inspirational.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|This is a must read for anyone!  Are you more successful in your job/life today than you were last month, last year?  Daniel Pink brings new meaning to winning in business and our personal lives by moving others to succeed.
B00BEIYN3M|5.0|If you thought Something about Mary was funny then I surmise you will think We are the Millers is hilarious.  The only complaint I have is Ed Helms playing a high level drug dealer was not convincing, they should have cast someone more wicked or believable (any suggestions?).  This movie is rated R for many reasons so I would not accompany anyone under 18.  The story is simple and stupid but aside from being absurd it is a laugh plus some.  This was a movie that has poor ratings from the critics and the general public enjoyed.  A popular website is currently at 80% favorably from 30,000 votes thus far.  This movie is not for those who object to the F bombs or the liberal use of the finger. It is just a joyous ridiculous romp of an adventure that occurs to dysfunctional people who get together because at the time they all have nothing better to do.  Stick around for the outtakes after the movie ends they were an added pleasure to a fairly predictable storyline, still freaking hilarious movie.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Wonderful  sequel to wonderful book. Couldn't have ask for better. Card brought me right back into the story. Now off to book 3 :)
B000VOC90Y|5.0|Really loving this backpack. It fits my 17 laptop WITH a Case Logic LAPS-17.3 inch laptop case. Really durable and happy it sits by itself.

B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love Cut The Rope and Om Nom and Om Nom is cute and cuddly and I want one. If you don't love Om Nom buy this it's so freakin awesome. I LOVE OM NOM!!!!!!!!!!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|good game keeps you busy for months. can get by with spending no real money. save ur bucks for big dinos n stores
B0000A14WB|1.0|Terrible Only one good song on disk!<br />Rip off from the start!!<br />Don't bother This is such bad news<br />So ver disappointing!
B0047SF41G|3.0|This film is not the worst of the Predator films, but mainly because the Alien Versus Predator films explored new realities of badness.<br /><br />On the plus side:<br />-Predators<br />-Action<br />-Battle<br /><br />On the minus side:<br />-Muddled plot.<br />-Weak characters.<br />-Characters are not likeable, so it is hard to care when they die. I did feel for the Predators, though-being in this film hurt them.<br />-Laurence Fishburne should have worked out or at least gone on a moderate diet to at least sort of maybe look the part.<br /><br />Sort of almost worth watching if you have nothing better to do. It won't wound your soul like the Alien Vs. Predator toxic waste dumps.
B003J27WFW|5.0|This DVD gives you a great look into who this band is! Three talented musician/entertainers who always strive for the best!
0439023513|5.0|I didn't read the series until after I saw the first movie because I thought of this as a \\"teenager/young adult\\" series.  While perhaps the first and second book fall more into this category, the last book deals with much more mature themes (although I'm sure still enjoyed by young people). This is a book that can be enjoyed on many levels and I'm very glad I decided to read it (p.s. I'm in the 55+ age category).
B002IXA5KW|5.0|I don't know why people are so hard on this move, I find it's a refreshing change for the normal comic - movie adaptation. Admittedly I never read the comic, but does that matter? The movie was entertaining.
0385486804|1.0|I've seem the movie, but haven't read the book.  From reading some reviews, and seeing the movie...does anyone else feel there may have been some degree of a severe personality disorder or degree of mental illness involved here?  What he did just isn't normal.  That's not to say we don't all have some inclination to do some of what Chris did, but to the seemgingly careless way he did it...doesn't that point to some type of mental disorder?  I could be totally wrong about this...but it's just my initial thoughts.  Maybe I'll change once I read the book, but from some of the reviews it seems the author is trying to justify what Chris did...and may not be all that objective.  I'll see.<br /><br />I can't imagine how Chris's family must have felt.  I really feel for them.  It had to be horrible...especially with the way his life ended weighing about 63 lbs.  So very sad.<br /><br />I had to rate it a 3 stars only because I haven't read it yet...and had to pick something.
B0060D08JO|5.0|Recommendation is to get high as hell and watch this movie, you'll be transported into another reality with amazing visuals, incredible soundtrack  and most of all...... the DUDE.  He DOES abide
B0064MPXFA|4.0|A good find. I like it when I find a good series and I cam play catch up on a season or two.
B002KEZ96Y|5.0|Does the Dude abide? Damn straight he does. Genius writing in this movie...<br />... I'm the Dude. So that's what you call me. That, or His Dudeness … Duder … or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|I like Susan Boyle's performances in general, and I like her song choices for this album. She has the humility so many others lack.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|I love this app. I used to use &#34;log me in&#34; software on my home desktop, but now that I have the Kindle Fire, this app is like having my own PC at my finger tips.  Thanks!

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I've been stuck in El Macho's Lair every since the app upgraded itself back on July 29.  Other than that, the graffics and game play is great for my son and I.
B00D6OV57O|5.0|Say what you will about the movie.  I personally thought it was a mix of everything.  Good, bad, great, terrible.<br /><br />The score, however, is epic beyond definition, no matter what.  I remember listening to it the first time after watching the movie and all of a sudden feeling whisked away on the rollercoaster of thrills that I first experienced while watching the visuals (in 3D Imax).
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this games is so fun u can't put it down once u start. it is a must have game really
1932907009|5.0|other books can teach you formatting.  heck, just read a script to learn that.  This book teaches you story, the most important part of any script.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Best book ever.<br /><br />I loved this book. It always kept me wondering what would happen next. I rank this one next to the perks of being a wallflower.
B008VBYN80|5.0|not a bad little game seems like it could kill a few hours the diamond cost could be annoying but you have some to start
B0036BP6XQ|5.0|GREAT MESSAGE for all of us to learn. I would recommend this movie to all. It shows how one person can make a difference.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Having fun playing this game.  Would like to find some similar free games to play.  Have not enjoyed other free games as much
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I have been using the Withings scale for over a year; a great way to track my weight. I have had a variety of devices to track my steps, my elevation gain, my heart rate, but this is the first device that is easy to use AND easy to wear, AND easy to retrieve data. Love the connection to the computer to track my activity. Thanks Withings Pulse. PS wish it had iPhone app: \\"Find my Pulse\\". I left it in pants pocket and \\"lost it for a few days because it is so conveniently small. Otherwise it is terrific!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If you love historical fiction, this is a must-see.  You will fall in love with the characters, both the aristocracy and the domestic help.<br />I can't wait for the new season.
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|I'm so in love with this band. They are unique, and so talented. they have kind of a depeche mode/ deftones kind of feel, but more lighthearted and modern.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This is a series that to watch it you have to start from the beginning.  I tried watching it once but started out in the middle of the 5th season.  Watched it a couple of times and really didn't understand it.  I then decided to start at the beginning so that I could understand it better and it has turned out to be great.
B008EKMB82|5.0|This amazing book manages to integrate complex characters, a strong sense of two places, physics concepts, and great storytelling.  You'll like it!
B000F3AAUW|5.0|I got this CD just for one song cause I love Cee Lo Green. Haven't listened to the whole thing yet. But, shipping was super fast from seller & packaged well. Good value too!
B00COCY67A|5.0|After being very prolific in the studio from 1969-71, Elvis concentrated mostly on live performing in 1972 and early 1973, recording just seven songs in the studio.  Early in 1973, shortly after the  [[ASIN:B00AR3WD8W Aloha From Hawaii via Satellite album (Legacy Edition)]] hit #1 on the charts, Elvis and the Colonel sold all of The King's pre-1973 catalog to RCA, and signed a new 7-year contract with the label (which Elvis, sadly, did not outlive).  New studio recordings were mandated as part of the deal, so rather than go back to Nashville or Hollywood, it was decided to return to Elvis' hometown of Memphis, so that he could visit his daughter, Lisa Marie, and sleep in his own bed at Graceland.  With Chips Moman's American Sound Studio, the site of the historic 1969 sessions, now closed, Stax Studios - only 10 minutes from Graceland - was chosen.  Two separate sessions were done, in July and December of 1973, and RCA released the material rather haphazardly over three albums between 1973 and 1975:  [[ASIN:B000008JK9 Raised on Rock]], [[ASIN:B002ZBEFEO Good Times]], and [[ASIN:B00004T0UR Promised Land]], as well as various posthumous compilations.<br /><br />This new Legacy Recordings release finally collects all of Elvis' Stax material in one place.  Disc 1 contains 17 R&B and country outtakes; Disc 2 has 10 pop outtakes and the ten July 1973 masters, and Disc 3 contains the 18 December 1973 masters.  You'll hear Elvis in top form on classics like \\"My Boy,\\" \\"If You Talk In Your Sleep,\\" \\"I Got A Feelin' In My Body,\\" \\"Promised Land,\\" \\"Spanish Eyes\\" (just as good as Al Martino's original), \\"Good Time Charlie's Got The Blues,\\" and many, many more.  Disc 3 is my favorite, but don't let that stop you from enjoying the rest of it.  Legacy has packaged this set similarly to the Elvis MSG collection, [[ASIN:B008QZ9E6M Prince From Another Planet (Deluxe 2 CD/1 DVD Box Set)]].  This set is a must-have for any Elvis fan.
B00C7E3EFU|4.0|I led a rather sheltered life as a child and teen. My parents were strict about the movies I could see and were completely against me taking in any type of supernatural horror films. I would go to my father's house during the summers and that's when I would catch up on all the great films I missed for the past year. One of my fondest memories is watching \\"The Fog\\" one night around dusk with my cousin.<br /><br />It made a lasting impact on me that was evident five minutes after the credits rolled. Back in the early eighties, big trucks would drive through my father's neighborhood right before the sun went down and spray for mosquitoes. The insecticide created a thick fog that slowly crawled up to the house from the street. Needless to say, I was terrified.<br /><br />The little coastal town of Antonio Bay is about to pay for the sins of its forefathers. 100 years after being misled to their rocky demise during a dense fog, a phantom ship full of ghostly specters exacts their revenge on the ancestors who plotted their deaths. No one is safe until the six living relatives of the conspirators are put to death.<br /><br />\\"The Fog\\" is rather tame besides some bad language and a scene of Jamie Lee Curtis and Tom Atkins discussing her art in bed together. For all intents and purposes it's a study in visual minimalism. A lot of violence and killing is insinuated but happens off-screen, which gives it a classic feel missing in more graphic and gory films. It's truly a practice in the school of \\"What you don't see is scarier than what you do.\\" It's a lesson many filmmakers could stand to learn today.<br /><br />The audio and video presentation for \\"The Fog\\" Collector's Edition gives audiences a great film that looks better than ever. Even though it's been upgraded, it still has that old school grainy flavor. The 5.1 surround sound guarantees that every sudden scream or jolting bump will have viewers jumping out of their seats. It also helps to bring John Carpenter's eerie electronic score to the forefront.<br /><br />Being a Scream Factory release, there's no question that the special features for \\"The Fog\\" Collector's Edition are going to be top-notch. Audio commentary is provided by Writer /Director John Carpenter and Writer/Producer Debra Hill. Adrienne Barbeau, Tom Atkins, and Production Designer Tommy Lee Wallace give us new audio commentary, too.<br /><br />There's also a rather in-depth new interview with Jamie Lee Curtis. Three featurettes are included entitled \\"Tales from the Mist: Inside 'The Fog,'\\" \\"'The Fog:' Storyboard to Film,\\" and \\"Fear on Film: Inside 'The Fog.'\\" We also take a look at the film's locations in \\"Horror's Hallowed Grounds.\\" Outtakes, theatrical trailers, and TV spots round out the bonus material.<br /><br />\\"The Fog\\" is one of those special horror films I hold up as one of the greatest ghost stories of all time. I look at it as an introduction to horror movies and used it as such on my son. It's dear to my heart and my experience seeing it for the first time will stay with me forever.ectronic score to the forefront.<br /><br />Being a Scream Factory release, there's no question that the special features for \\"The Fog\\" Collector's Edition are going to be top-notch.

B0083Z614S|5.0|It is a feel good story,very enjoyable,<br />didn't want it to finish,<br /> it made me feel happy,<br />I will read it again in the furture
B002QBS9KE|5.0|This was a find for me! The original was so old and used, I took the ear piece off and thought I lost it, but quickly realized that it was stuck in my ear! That was my fault, because everything needs maintenance! I always just put it on and went out the door and after a year it was due! They turn and lock in place and that was the spot that was worn, so if you own one of these, I highly recommend this to anyone!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My daughter (age 6) loves this game. The horses are very realistic and the mini-games are the perfect level for her ability. I think this game should hold her attention for a few years. I don't like how you have to purchase the &#34;gems&#34; in order to complete certain &#34;goals&#34; in the game. If it is meant for kids, that is not right.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Mystery Manor is a great touch point and click game. Each room is a challenge and gives a prize.  It is an entertaining way to spend time. I enjoy the search.
0307477479|5.0|I went into this book knowing that it was non-linear and I didn't have the same expecatations as a typical novel. Keeping up with the characters is confusing at times but part of the fun of reading this novel is connecting the dots. Teleporting to different points in time and into different characters is a wild ride too. A Visit from The Goon Squad was very engaging and a breath of fresh air for me.
0345529057|5.0|My books got to me as expected. Everything is just fine, and I'm working my way through the series. Excellent!!!
B00ARA4SLU|5.0|This is ultimately about a wife who has good reasons to no longer feel as valued, desired, and appreciated by her husband as she deserves to be.  The temptation to be another man's muse is understandable.  It's brilliant how all the deep seated jealousies, obsessions, and fears of old Hitch himself are imagined in specific scenes of \\"Psycho\\" and it has a happy ending that never feels forced.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|This was a lot of fun but was still confused about what type of movie it should be.  It starts out like a gritty buddy war movie but then moves into popcorn action movie.  It is a lot of fun but I might have liked it holding on to the grit a bit longer.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app because my bible is always near me so I'm encouraged to spend time in His word. The YouVersion bible also helps me to grow my faith by providing a daily bible verse, reading plans and allows me to bookmark my favorite verses.
1401937519|5.0|I am reading this book for the second time.  It is very interesting and charming and amazing.  It is very hard to describe what I cannot understand, the author's miraculous healing.  She returns to life and to health with a transformed view of the world and everything in it.  I cannot understand that either, but I have not been where she has.  It is a well written book and very worth reading.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I am still reading this book, as I am taking my time. It's really good and I like it. alot
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I can't say this movie wasn't entertaining, and I enjoyed the witches' characters a lot. James Franco's Oz, though, was always kind of smarmy and really never changed, which made viewers want to dislike the main character throughout the entire movie.  It was also too long (2 hours 11 minutes) for no good reason. If editing had been tighter I would have rated it a little higher.  And if Oz had been likeable, it could have come close to a 5.  It's still worth seeing, but... it's not worth much. Rent it for cheap or borrow it from the library.
1400067820|1.0|Nassim Nicholas Taleb has succeeded in writing a book full of promise. It is called Antifragile, a concept he has innovated in the absence of any clear contrast to Fragile. You might think, What about robust? No, no, no. You are just not getting it. Robust simply avoids being fragile. Antifragile actively benefits where fragile suffers damage. The opposite of Handle with Care would be, Handle with Destructive Intent. And the theory is that some things benefit from this, that is to say they benefit from being handled with destructive intent, as opposed to merely remaining unaffected, and that these things can be called Antifragile. So the conclusion is, oh, spoiler - people who have trouble managing money would benefit from being handled with destructive intent. Anyone who is dyslexic or depressed would benefit from being handled with destructive intent. You might imagine that this is some brilliant contemporary version of Swift's Modest Proposal, but the sheer parroting mindlessness of his style betrays otherwise.<br /><br />Undoubtedly the ensuing circumlocution is a parade of Taleb's self-appointed status as an autodidact. Anyone with any taste will immediately be suspicious of such a word, and positively alarmed at anyone appointing themselves as... an autodidact. Of course I'm not saying that Taleb sounds like a delusional dope-smoker alternating between self-aggrandizement and paranoia. I'm not saying he sounds like a recalcitrant girl-friend, screaming at you to be decoded and for god's sake loved. I am not saying he's a jock trying on the expressions of civilized men, putting a false interpretation on them and drawing the queerest conclusions. And I am certainly not saying or going to get bogged down in saying that he is a child of privilege, purveying unphilosophical, parochial ultra-conservatism clothed ill-fittingly in a confused adolescence spent guzzling the fashionable (read toe-curling) literature of the french left without really thinking about it.<br/><br />It is worth getting bogged down in this idea that David Cameron not only claims allegiance to this character, but is actually basing policy on this drifting, disjointed parade of quotations. Is that possible? He is claiming to base policy on the ideas (or is that too strong a word?) of Taleb.<br /><br />For anyone who imagines there is rigor at the heart of the establishment, now is the time to wake up. No rigour. Just a wing and a prayer. This vomit-inducing parade of labored cliche is the baseless base on which we balance. Don't buy it! Just try to pretend it doesn't exist.
B000IZAHB4|4.0|Movie contains good thrilling shots but overall little slow. Good to watch with family. Nice entertainment. I like jeepers creepers 2 more than 1.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The idea of the world being ruined and everyone spending their life in a video game was kind of scary and I hope that never happens, but for a fictional story I thought it was a great idea. I didn't live in the eighties, so some of the things mentioned in the book were confusing but other than that the story was easy to follow. I don't really appreciate the profanity but other than that the range of vocabulary was good.
B00190OHD6|5.0|A great story, with great acting, nice scenes that, together, bring you in the story. I think it's an underrated movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really fun and callenging game.  I have beaten all the levels and I am ready to play more levels as they are released!
B00ECU2SGS|1.0|I paid for the HD rental, and it was only standard def.  Waste of an extra buck.  Movie was good though.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I have a great time with my three year old trying to find the right combination of dragons to create an egg. He just wants to decorate the island. I now find myself playing after he is in bed for the night.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I downloaded this to my G1 Fire.  App took forever to download, then hijacked over 3gb of data storage.  Uninstalling the app did not recover any storage space.  I needed to restore my kindle to factory defaults.<br /><br />Definatley a flawed or botched coding issue for G1 Kindle fires.<br /><br />Don't bother downloading if you have a G1 Fire!!!!!
B000S1M9LY|2.0|Very strange, and quickly bored me. Made me think of the writer as a heavily medicated man, holed up alone for a long time, just writing down any strange thought that came to his mind. Kept thinking this has to get better, but no such luck. Not at all entertaining.
B001B51B9M|5.0|Remembered by the older generations and being introduced to the younger in the Blue-ray format.  We just can't help getting up and matching with the band!
B007HACDLK|4.0|If you love the show Homeland, you'll love this book. A bit more violent than I normally read, but well written and kept me intrigued till the end.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|This was sweet and entertaining. Wreck-it Ralph is a great rainy day family movie. One of the few movies the all the kids sat through.
B00CWVF2GC|4.0|I am a big fan of Eytan Fox. In this follow up to Yossi & Jagger, we find the once handsome Yossi  now fat and &#34;closeted &#34; at the age of 34.  He is still self loathing and we never really see any passion as was so wonderfully present in the original film.  &#34;Yossi&#34; was a disappointment to me, but Fox does present an acurrate portrayal of &#34;gay Israel &#34;.  I would only recommend to those curious or rather obsessed with sequels.  But please remember, sequels seldom match originals.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|One of the best.  From the tension of the opening to the flash back to why it was happening. Lee Child knows how to tell the story of Jack none Reacher.  Truth, I read this some time ago and I think the reread was even better than the first one.
B007PS0DTI|3.0|Not nearly as good as the films leading up to this one, but entertaining even if it is uneven, which I found it to be.
B009CPE7CQ|5.0|The five seasons of Mentalist were all wonderful.  The basic format for the show is always based on a crime with a touch of humor.  The Red John part keeps you guessing which makes the shoe intertwining and inrteresting.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have it on my iPhone as well.  I'm actually taking my Kindle with me more due to this little app.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I absolutely love this game!!! It is so fun and for all ages too!!!! And I just have to say that Gameloft is the best game company ever the only thing I don't like about this company is that it takes up waaaay too much space!!!!!!!!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The costumes, the acting, the period.  Oh my!  This is a series I will be watching over and over.  And buying it in a set like this is a really good savings.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season 2 was even better than season 1....looking forward to season 4 in Jan 2014.  love the twists and turns during each show.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I don't have kids but I don't think it's best for younger children given some of the content and some of the moral underlining may be missed entirely by still developing young minds. Loved it, and highly suggest it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have like a gazillion apps in my iTunes library. There's no way I can get them all on my iPhone. Now I have the choice of putting some of them on my Kindle too. The fact that the screen is bigger is just icing on the cake.
B006WPWH4E|3.0|I found that I prefer playing solitaire on my computer, easier for me to see the cards and I can never get the correct set up.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|love, bingo blitz, it is fun to play, but there are certain things in cities that are impossible to get which is a little aggravating.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|Very heart warming movie, based on a true story.  An attention holding story of the relationship between a unique horse and the woman who owned him and all who came in contact with him.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|One of my favorite movies !!!  Nice wholesome family movie.  Drew Barrymore is spectacular.  Also take a look at her &#34;Never Been Kissed&#34;, we loved that too.
B000002KHH|4.0|I bought this to remind me of what rock and roll ment in the old days. Guess what? Sounds as good today as it did 100 years (or so) ago when it first came out. Maybe you had to be there to really appreciate it. Still sounds good to me though.
B004QIG7CW|5.0|Ordered this for my 10 year old daughter after seeing it on Disney channel; Excellent!! I love watching it with her! There's a story behind each character as well as all of them together. Shows how to deal with personal issues as friends and as a family as well. Also, pier issues and relationships addressed well! Excellent how the story begins and comes to an awesome end!! Great music! Will definitely get the sound track.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|This CD is the first introduction to Joe Bonamassa I've had and I am impressed. This man knows how to play. Looking forward to hearing more.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is a great app. Great for project managers! What I love is that there are no sync issues which was nice.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|When kindle for android is opened my tablet shuts down a d must be restarted. The tablet is Chromo Inc . Android 4.1.1. I have paid books that I can not access
B00BWGISB4|5.0|What a nice surprise.  This album is a well written and thought out discography.  I am pleased to see these guys haven't lost their touch.  With a string of so-so albums following &#34;Hangin' Tough&#34; this is a great breakaway album.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|I would definitely recommend this movie - it's funny for older kids and aduults, although parts of it are not suitable for younger children.
B0019NG73G|5.0|This movie is excellent.  That coupled with the nice HD transfer makes one history buff extremely happy.  The packaging is unique and good for a serious bluray collector.
B00006F1IJ|5.0|I am a very big fan of this duo and only wished that there was more music from them.  Fabulous!
B008RTE066|5.0|What a wonderfully restored Beatles movie.  Recorded before I was even born, this movie is a great way to admire the guys over the years and see how they were in and out of the publc eye.  This collector's edition is a magnificient piece of history for the BEATLES fans out there.  Hip hip hooray!
B003CHGV74|4.0|great drama and plotlines.  only 4 stars because I like Homeland and Entourage better.  interesting to watch the characters evolve.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is arguably the best Batman movie next to it's predecessor.  The use of Bain as the main villain and Catwoman as Batman's enemy and love interest is executed nicely.  The audio and surround sound are like no other and this film is great to use for source material in any store.  Christian Bale is probably the best Batman ever to hit the screen since Adam West.
B00BW5K5DO|1.0|My 3 boys hate it they say it belongs In the trash it is only taping and waiting I never liked it but I download it because There is five in a half stars so the  boys erese it
B005Z28M58|5.0|I desperately miss the ladies on Wisteria Lane and there is no better sendoff then the final season.  All of the storylines were wrapped up beautifully and the series is as vivid on blu-ray as it was on network TV (even more so)
B001EAWMGA|5.0|Wanted to aid to our collection, fun to watch, good syfy for an afternoon when you find yourself in the mood for a movie without something moral of political to say. Just and experience.
B005RDF2RG|4.0|This movie is great.  Like parfait.  Have you ever met a person, you say, &#34;Let's get some parfait,&#34; they say, &#34;Hell no, I don't like no parfait&#34;?  Parfaits are delicious.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I haven't read about Agent Pendergast for some time until I read Two Graves. But still, the attraction is there, the drama, the suspense, the thrill of reading about how he approaches any case. Can't wait to read his next adventure. He is James Bond without the sense of 'invincibility'...a very human James Bond.<br />Best to read his novels in sequence for better appreciation of the various nuances and meanings.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I bought the book(s) because I was captivated by the TV show when free HBO was available. The filmed story line follows the book fairly closely, so it helps to fill in story lines that seemed confusing just watching the show. I also liked that I could visualize the characters and settings better because of seeing the videos. As with all good books, the story is richer and more nuanced than the video could ever be.
B0011Z7KGK|5.0|I had a great time listening to the songs. And had alot of memories braught back to me of seeing Nickelback in concert in Tortonto. Lots of fun. Enjoy.
0385535147|2.0|Grisham carries the torch of the post-modern writer: America is racist, morality is gray, and a novel can be phoned to a team of ghostwriters from 5,000 miles away. I wish I could say Grisham also used a team of researchers, but as even Grisham admits, he didn't bother with research. That was clear! I wanted to stop reading several times when my eye rolling began to give me a headache. But I finally stopped at the incest scene. Can someone please tell me why writers love incest? I can't pick up a novel written post 1930 without it being laden with incest. I can put up with a lot, but I'm sick of incest. If incest sells books, there's something seriously wrong with the public. Despite all that, the writing is choppy, the voice unclear if not irritating, and the protagonist is a disgusting mess. Don't read this crap!
B00BIR381W|5.0|Got it immediately! Brand new like i wanted, great shape, amazing series, and was given the price guarantee! When the price for it dropped and i had already ordered it, they gave me a discount before taking it out of my account, helllooo savings!!!
B005544V6A|5.0|I would recommend this show to everyone! Great show. Harvey is awesome. Best show on TV as of right now.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Great summer read for adventure buffs. As usual James Rollins delivered a story that kept me reading long after I should have been asleep at night.
0545405777|5.0|This edition of The Hunger Games is worth the money. If you're a fan of the series, do not hold back on getting this book.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is a wonderful book that has it all: technical details (I had no idea it was so hard to culture cancer cells!), the politics of economics and race, and both medical and U.S. history. So many people use HeLa cells without a second thought... but they came from someone, someone who died of her disease after a protracted course of futile treatment. The insights into the treatment were eye-opening as well. A terrific read.
145210655X|5.0|Funny and original story, for Star Wars fans something that they have to by.<br />Very nice drawings and humorous text, high-quality printing and binding. Book is fully met my expectations.<br />I was pleasantly surprised by the speed of delivery, because the shipment has arrived even before the deadline specified in the order.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I love animated films but this was above and beyond funny and heartwarming, which I was not what I was expecting.  Pleasant surprise.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I am so disappointed with facebook on my kindle. The print is so small I can't read anything. My son even had trouble reading the print and he's much younger than me. Actually going to delete it from the kindle.
B00607EWYC|5.0|I thought this book was a great read...insightful, soft, real, heartbreaking and human.  It was very enlightening and well written.
B00DYOOGYK|3.0|I played gangster rio and liked it certainly because when the people talked they actually had facial expressions and other  lips actually moved well gangster Vegas is decent by  the put to much effort on your character and cars and not the open world itself it was corny graphics to the end. One bad thing is the extreme mature content this is NOT recommended for kids because of profanity, nudity, racial slurs and more. Overall for its high price I would not recommend this game to anyone.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I was totally drawn in and hooked by the end of the first episode.  Couldn't wait to get the next season!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Wasn't always exciting but it was a good representstion of how things were at that time. All in all I didn't mind reading it at all(:
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Fantastic story, the online streaming went really smoothly, excellent graphics, no issues with loading, or pausing in the middle. Great product
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game this game is so amazing I play this game all the time it's so intriguing love it love it!!!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I commend Brandon Sanderson for pulling off the final volume in fine style; I didn't think it was possible, regardless of how good (or bad) Robert Jordan's notes were. Battle scenes were terrific, Mat's generalship evident, relationships played nicely, and best of all Rand's fate was quite acceptable. It was worth being reminded why he and Mat got together in the beginning! Not a standalone book by any means, but a worthy end to an amazingly ambitious series!
B0041KVXLA|5.0|THE FIRST ALBUM RELEASED ON PARLAPHONE LABEL IN THE UK . ITS THE SAME AS MEET THE BEATLES THE US RELEASE ON CAPITOL LABEL .IF YOUR A SERIOUS COLLECTOR YOU'LL DEFINATELY WANT THIS ALBUM IN YOUR COLLECTION .YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED PURCHASING ANY BEATLE ALBUM RELEASED ON  PARLAPHONE LABLE .THEY ARE TWICE AS HEAVY AS U.S. ALBUM AND MUCH BETTER MADE .PURCHASE ONE AND YOU'LL SEE WHAT I MEAN .
0061950726|4.0|A poignant and remarkable story of two orphans of separate generations intertwining their lives as<br />both struggled with circumstances.  .
B00BMUVUZG|3.0|This was not at all what I expected, not having read any of this series before buying this one.  I quickly realised this was geared more towards teenagers rather than 'mature' readers like myself!  Having said that, I would highly recommend this book for literacy services for adults.  It provides intelligent, yet easily understood, fiction in a non patronising way.  Could this be the reason for writing it?
0345529057|5.0|My friend is really into GOT and so these books where perfect for his b day.<br />He could not put the books down. ^_^
B0052FG750|5.0|The difference between the original mix and this mix is very noticeable to me, I can really hear the rest of the band much better, crisper, defined and louder. Jim sounds pretty much the same, but a little clearer.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|There's not much too it, it's just simply the best touch keyboard I've ever used. I'm on my third device with it and it's wonderful. The predictive/learning text is exceptional and the customization options are a bonus. This is a must have app.<br /><br />SwiftKey are selling themselves short, I'd pay much more for this app. For the record, I think this is only one of three apps I'd actually pay for.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I reread the whole series up to this point before I read this one and, man, Mr. Jordan's awesome story is a fulfillment of his lifetime vision.  I am so glad it was able to be finished with his passing and I thank Mr Sanderson for taking on the task to ghost write the finish and Mrs. Jordon for supporting her husband's vision and work.  She is a powerful woman from her actions of support to her husband.<br /><br />My only regret is that there will not be any expanded stories, like of the Aiel vision of Aviendiha, or the rest of Rand's or Perrin's or Matt's stories that I know that he would have written about had he not passed.<br /><br />My heart is broken because the story is over, but I am glad that it ending the way that it did.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is an easy game to play. I think even a first grader can play this game and have fun.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Jaime' s innocence is touching, and his suffering heart breaking; but there is courage, and the tenderness of dear friends, as well as, gentle and sometimes uproarious humor.  I found myself pulling for this guy the whole time.  What great characters.  Well done I say!

B00CATSONE|4.0|Interesting historical segue into the main story of Nikola Tesla who many (most?) folks don't know as the [first] inventor of the precursors of today's technology that the greater world takes for granted such as wireless, RCF, etc.  Edison did not have the exclusive line on electricity.  Short, concise and worth the read.
0525951652|5.0|introduction to a new dynasty, factual on events and dates, a brilliant read.<br />I couldn't put it down, even though there are many characters you never loose touch with the situation.
0553582038|3.0|These books are packed with so much \\"filler\\" -  unimportant histories of names & events.  I would rather read 500 pages of good a story than 1000 pages filled with details that mean nothing to the actual storyline.  I was scanning parts of it, and honestly, I was getting bored with it.  Mostly, I'm quite tired of how there isn't a conclusion to anything unless someone dies, but even if they die, they're still disconnected from their families or have unfinished business.  There are too many insignificant characters to keep up with, and I was drowning in details. Also, this fourth book was slowly becoming more like a soap opera.  I'm debating on reading the 5th book.
B0011XBLUS|5.0|\\"if you are gonna shoot, shoot; don't talk\\"<br />and that about says it all folks this is the best, not a drop wasted' the new scenes are impeccalbe. a masterpiece.

1401235417|5.0|How can you tell if a DC Comic title is worth reading? Just look for Scott Snyder's name on the front cover. Everuthing he writes is incredible and this title is certainly no exception.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|The world isn't very large but there's plenty here to keep you busy for hours... love the upgrade they did so now there's a jetpack.. very addictive
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I loved this book. It's a quick read but I found myself fist pumping and shouting &#34;Yes!&#34; while I read. Austin addressed many of the issues I face,  feeling a need to create but getting stuck and not knowing how to get to the next level in my music and writing. Every aspiring artist with a dream should read this book. Now I'm going to have to watch all of his TED talks...
B007THA4FI|3.0|The ending was good... it brought the book full circle but the plot itself was lacking. You did get to know the characters well.
B009GEYX5E|1.0|All 8 prints came out black or an array of colors. You could not even tell that it was supposed to be a picture of something. Truly terrible and a waste of $25.

B009NQZVKG|5.0|an excellent novel.  Very engrossing and interesting plot, with very good character development.  I look forward to reading more of James Rollins and will go back to get the older books.
B002Q7JYPC|4.0|Amazing that after all these years and all the turmoil the guys can still produce some amazing, heart-felt tunes.  Excellent.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|You get one game every 45 min for free. If you want to play more than that, it's gonna cost you. Otherwise, the game is just like real life. I would rather pay $5 for the app and get unlimited games like scrabble.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My grandson loves it and enjoyed the movie.  I downloaded this on my cellphone and I enjoy playing the game at work when there is down time, of course.
B000002J1M|5.0|This review is here to address those individuals who are, as of yet, completely unfamiliar with the album \\"Foxtrot\\".  Here goes...<br />I will start this review by admitting I have more than a little bit of bias here, as this was the first Gabriel-era Genesis album I ever heard.  I'd experienced plenty of music by other bands of the time, including Yes and King Crimson, but nothing quite prepared me for the moment I first sat down and heard this album come out of a pair of very good stereo speakers at a friend's house.  The first song was key:<br /><br />Watcher of the Skies:  The mellotron comes in solo, and plays these opening chords that completely blew me away on first hearing, with their dark moodiness and epic symphonic sound.  And it wasn't just grandeur and pomp and effect.  No, it was composition.  Great composition.  Simply put: Tony Banks, plays one of the most spectacularly beautiful and powerful chord progressions I've ever heard on a Rock album (or any album of any kind), and he does it completely unaccompanied!  The band waits until over a minute and a half into the cut before it joins in, and by that time the chords have morphed from murky darkness into brilliant light.  The drummer, Phil Collins, brings in a powerful morse code-style 6/4 rhythmic figure, and then the rest of the band kicks in, and then WHAM, the song takes off.  Peter Gabriel launches into an anthemic melody, and a post-apocolyptic lyric that absolutely soars above the beautiful din of the band pushing and pulsing underneath.  I heard that the band began to open their shows with this song before the actual release of the album, which clearly shows their level of confidence in it's power and effect in live performance.  As well, it suits this album perfectly, as it sets the tone for what's to come.  Naturally, you hear much of the chordal mellotron intro reprised at the end, this time with the band rocking along very hard.  The perfect ending.<br /><br />Time Table: As well starts ofwith a startlingly original keyboard line, this time much shorter though, and played on a regular piano.  What follows is a somewhat subdued verse that doesn't pack the same visceral punch as the previous cut, except perhaps for the brief chorus, when Gabriel sings \\"Why can we never be sure till we die...?\\" with his own kind of urgency, giving the song a real lift.  Then the outro ends on an even more subdued note, as it fades into silence.  I believe the strength of the song's placement on this album is mostly to create a bridge between the opener and what's to come, which is...<br /><br />Get 'Em Out By Friday:  Immediately picks things up with a swirling, energetic intro and groove, soon after which  Gabriel tears into a song about a futuristic tale of eviction (based on the physical heights of the tenants).  The alternating dreamier narrative sections are offset by the powerful and aggressive main hook, which comes in like a bat out of hell at all the right moments.  This is a standout song on the album for sure, but it helps to make oneself familiar with the actual story that it's telling.  Gabriel's lyrics are up there with his best.<br /><br />Can-Utility and the Coastliners: This is the most symphonic song on the album so far, after Watcher of the Skies.  Composed principally by the guitarist Steve Hackett, this lands as one of his very best efforts, and a truly unique piece that adds some of that wonderfully peculiar magic that reminds me of the more whimsical moments on the previous album Nursery Cryme.  Though the vocal lines are always interesting and fresh, the purely instrumental sections shine so very brilliantly as well, conjuring up a kind of magic and inspiration that invites many re-listenings over time.  This is truly the \\"sleeper\\" track on the album-the one that creeps up on you over time, and casts its spell, despite the lack of any kind of a definable chorus or \\"hook\\".  Foxtrot would not be nearly the unique and colorful album it is without this great track.  And as well, it segues so very perfectly into...<br /><br />Horizons: The one acoustic guitar solo on the album.  The opening is borrowed from the Bach Cello Suite in G, but quickly morphs into something pure Hackett, and full of subtle, delicate beauty. Although a bit of an unusual choice for this kind of an album, it works perfectly to calm the waters and cleanse the palette for what's to come, which is...<br /><br />Supper's Ready:  The opening of this 23-minute epic was based on a rather spooky incident that happened when Peter Gabriel was alone with his wife at their home one evening.  The lyrics pretty much tell it like it is.  As the music begins to change a couple of minutes in, amidst rolling guitar arpeggios, you hear wordless \\"Aaahhhs\\" intone over shifting guitar and keyboard lines, and it becomes clear that this is not going to be just one song, but rather several pieces (seven, in fact) within one larger uninterrupted suite.  This sort of thing has been done by many prog bands over time, but \\"Supper's Ready\\" turned out to be something truly special, even miraculous, and no other prog \\"epic\\" (in my opinion) has ever matched it for sheer drama and power.  The pieces flow into each other in a way that defies description or analysis.  The big anthemic climax happens once briefly, early on, and then reprises at the end, after a powerful build-up (the \\"Apocalypse\\" section), and the effect is absolutely stunning beyond words.  It is the perfect closer to an unforgettable album.  Peter Gabriel has said that the act of singing this piece was for him, the most profoundly cathartic, and that he never held back a bit, either in passion or overall intensity, whenever they'd perform it live.<br /><br />After this release, the band would go on to create the much-loved \\"Selling England by the Pound\\".  Some say that it would go on to equal, and even surpass Foxtrot in consistency of quality.  I would say that to own one album, and not the other would be to miss out on much of what the band had to offer in the years preceding \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\".  \\"Selling England\\" is a terrific album for sure, and a stellar follow-up to this one.  But as a first-time introduction to the band, Foxtrot is for me, the single best choice out there.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is a good and fun app!!!However it took FOREVER to load!!!! it is a cool app I love all of the minions and the costumes but I hats how you have to buy certain things!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Wonderful reading...Nicholas Sparks does it again! Every book he writes he does so keeping my attention from start to finish!
B0064MGU98|5.0|The character who stars in the show is the woman we would all like to be without it being sappy.
B0007TKNII|5.0|For a used movie it is in excellent condition.<br />The music and story line are terrific.<br />Recommend highly for teens to adult
B009GX69RK|5.0|I love this show. It's something my significant other and I watch together and both can enjoy and laugh at.

B00B81B0HC|5.0|Thought I was getting one genre and ended up getting a few that I like more.  Completely awesome - I recommend this. :)
B002ZG983M|5.0|One of my favorite movies! Great action and comedy! If you like gore and plenty of filthy language this is your movie!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is easy to play and keeps the kids busy for hours. I also have become addicted to the game.
B002Y0TGOU|1.0|I had a very difficult time watching it.  The violence and killing started right off the bat.  It was too extreme for me.  I couldn't watch past the torture.
B00001QGPR|3.0|This y2k release is also noteworthy as it is the last to feature guitarist Reeves Gabrels. RG proved to be an effective creative foil for Bowie. Sure there are some great songs on here like Something In The Air, Pretty Face Is Going To Hell, What's Really Happening?, New Angels of Promise and Seven. Also worth checking out are the 'bonus' remixes for Pretty Face and Something's in The Air which appeared in motion pictures, Stigmata and American Psycho. The reason i'm giving Hours just 3 1/2 stars is that imo, there are better Bowie albums out there spanning from the early nineties (Black Tie White Noise and Buddah Of Suburbia) and there's the epic release from '96, Earthling which I think was more energetic than this album.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|it was good but slow and a little depressing.  Good in that it showed that even when you're old you can still enjoy your talent with others.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|this was somewhat action filled and I as an adult did enjoy this film with my husband. Its been awhile since I got to see a fairy tale movie and I really enjoyed this one ... Thanks..:)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This has been the best English saga yet.  The actors are England's best and we are anxious to see the rest of the series.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|Really addicting game!  There are three modes: infinite, which is move based, so you have plenty of time to think and strategize; survival, which requires fast thinking as you have a limited amount of time to move things around; and zen mode.  Very easy to learn and addicting once you start playing.  I also love that the game saves at any point so you can leave and come back right where you left off.  It makes for a great game to play while waiting for the subway, etc.
0316726729|5.0|Book was in good shape, not great, lot of yellow on pages/cover so I wouldnt say it was perfect but it's an amazing book and couldnt care what color it was
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This is a great book. Easy to read. Great storyline. Easy to understand and follow along with. i would definately recommend it
0425263908|1.0|I read this book because I met the author, Sylvia Davy at a conference and promised her I would read the book.  I was disappointed.  In no way does it compares to \\"Fifty Shades of Gray\\".  \\"Fifty Shades of Gray\\" is romantic.  You had a knight in shinning amour come and rescue the maiden, and they lived happily.  \\"Bared to You\\" is about 2 messed up, sexually abuse people having sex.  I don't know, but can sexually abused people have such sex without reservation?  Where is the romance in this book.  They see  each other once and \\"WOW\\" instantly they are sexually attracted  to each other.  And by chance they meet at every turn.  Oh, the sexual attraction, magical magnetism is a bunch of crap.  Then the sex is everywhere, (in the car, the office, someone else's home), the sexually banging is on.  No respect for each other or the other people in their lives. The book is purely just about sex.  So what, he buys her some clothes and a ring.  That does not make romance.  Romance should be romantic. Romance is more than just sex.  This book should not be considered Romantic, it is not even erotica.
076790382X|3.0|I enjoyed reading it - but is not as good as &#34;Notes from a small Island&#34; less funny and original
B002VWNIAY|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and a classic. I decided I needed to own a copy to watch whenever I wanted. It is a great story with amazing actors and actresses. A must see for anyone!
B004GYY714|5.0|TuneIn Radio is a good radio app to listen to. I am able to stay in touch with my originally birth country since you can listen to international radios.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|This is the 4th book that I've read by Kate Morton.  \\"The House at Riverton\\" was my least favorite book by the author,<br />but I did enjoy reading it. It's definitely a book that's hard to put down, and you'll find yourself wanting to read<br />the entire book in one setting.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is a very nice picture which can be enjoyed by the entire family.<br />I would recommend it to everyone.
1423140605|5.0|It's finally here. This book was so good, I read it 3 times in 2 days. Rick Riordan is an amazing author, spinning suspense, tension, and action into every paragraph. Unlike the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, The Heroes of Olympus series mixes different cultures that have a lot in common together. Roman vs. Greeks makes one thrilling novel. Even though the ancient people have much in common, the modern ones never see each other as equals. The demigods are like this too. The Romans launch into war about a misunderstanding in this story, while the 7 half bloods that answered the call are trying to save the world. Again. So, if you like mythology, battles, and romance, you should definitely read this book
B00CRMX53S|5.0|I really don't know what to say except that this is a great song! Love, love, love, love, love it.
1616551607|5.0|It's hard to believe that something like this would exist for so little. I definitely got more than I expected, and it felt like every religious holiday thrown into one when I saw the size of the package the post office handed over to me. And then I opened it!<br />Pages upon pages of glory spitting your face. Silk bound box, with three massive books with more pictures than words. I'm sure I must have been tricked. I keep checking to see if there is maybe some kind of 'conspiratorial' script watermarked into the pages, for a cult trying to brainwash us through reasonably priced masterpieces. Haven't found anything yet. Might just have to accept that someone in the publishing world decided to be very nice to people like me.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Each movie comes on its own disc. Great quality and product if you enjoy the rocky films.<br />strongly recommend the purchase.
B008N9AASC|5.0|I've seen the previous film by Ron Friecke &#34;Baraka&#34; and I found it astonishing so I really wanted to see &#34;Samsara&#34;. I absolutely  love it: a visual meditation on the internal and external  spheres (which all evidences show to be finally only one) of human being  Samsara seems to be an extensio of Baraka, highlighting some aspects of the human nature that enslave us to suffering and redention.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Well written books. I read all three back to back so it got a bit much. By the end was tired of the characters but worth reading overall. Anyone else notice the three gazillion references to coffee across the entire series?
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It is a lot of fun to play, and my grandchildren love it too! One of my grandson's have gotten to get a couple different types of vehicle's to use

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I wonder why I bought this book.<br />The above headline says it all.<br />If you want to waste your money then go ahead and buy it.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|I feel like I was mislead. I never would have paid the asking price for this book, had I known it was an \\"adult fairytale\\". In my opinion, it was written for imaginative 12 year old children.  Save me from Harry Potter \\"wanna be\\" authors and put these kinds of books in the children's section please.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really fun and logic game, because the longer you go without getting out the harder you have to stay focused and the harder the game gets.
B00BD62X14|5.0|Heard her several times when her husband was in power in France.  Recently heard her on the Today Show.  Had to pick up her latest CD.  A wonderful songwriter and artist.
140053271X|4.0|Just received my eBook Reader and am very pleased with it.  Only problem, the usb cable doesn't seem to keep a firm connection to the devise and it took longer than usual for the book to charge.  I finally used the usb cable that came with my first Nook and it charged in no time.<br />The pages turn fast as advertised and the screen is very easy to read.  Can't say anything negative except for the cable and would recommend The Simple Touch eBook Reader.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I begged my mom to get me this and she did. I was super happy. I only have 1 complaint. You have to pay another .99 to unlock more levels but it's a great time killer.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|After watching Season One, I was hooked and had to have the Second Season to watch.  Buying it makes it easier to come back and see what you might have missed in this very compelling series.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|We wish that you had a hint section for the game, my granddaughter played on this till she could not go any further.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I had heard my friends talk about his series and started to watch and now I'm hooked!  Game of Thrones is a wonderful adventure into the world of medieval castles, thrones and the wars that come with it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book captured my interest and held it to the very last page. I really felt like I was dropped into each of the characters lives and felt the swell of emotions they all experienced. I would definitely recommend this for some great vacation or weekend reading. You won't want to put it down.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|My kids and I watched this movie-its the kind of movie that you just can't leave the room for a moment-or you will miss something great. This movie was outstanding.--I urge everyone to watch
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game I  addicting I stay up till 1 in the morning playing this game it is awesome I don't want to play any other game ever I've seen the movie and now I'm play the game I know every character's name an  every thing Angus is so cute.
0525953728|2.0|The book may have provided a good overview of the Navy Seal program from a 1st person perspective but little else of substance.  And most readers looking for the actual siege on the Bin Laden compound will have to wait until the end of the book to experience any of the surrounding drama.  While a few parts of the book could be considered interesting if not for bland - and quite painful - writing, no doubt this book was rushed for release way before it was ready for print.  I'm sure any TV special on the Navy Seals program or the actual killing would be more interesting and insightful than in the pages of this book. The positive of this book is that it was useful to get me asleep.<br />While I didn't confirm, others have noted than none of the charitable proceeds of the book were actually accepted by the military charities or programs. I recommend sending your money to a charity rather than buying this book and hoping the charity gets some of sales price.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I really loved this book. It has everything, humour, pathos, sadness and happiness.  I found myself laughing out loud at some parts of it, almost in tears at other parts. One of the best books I have read in a while.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|This movie is great. Even if you haven't read the book. The book is a good addition to buying the movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am usually a very descriptive person. I like giving details, explanations, you get it. By after reading this book I can only say this: FIVE STARS. ONE HUNDRED OUT OF TEN. READ BOOK NOW.
B00CS7ZIHI|3.0|I love 30 second to mars but this is a bit different. It is not what I expected. Its not horrible just different. The song do or die, is a good zumba song. Each song is very different.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Like Tony the tiger said it's more then good it's great!! I love this game very fun and keeps me busy when I'm bored
0618001905|5.0|This book is so detailed about what happened in Congo and why things are still the way they are in that area, a must read.
140006922X|5.0|A skillful and clearly presented analysis, at first much like those of Borg and Crossan, entwined in a context of ancient history, writings and culture, but with many new insights, which are interesting, intriguing, fascinating, and gritty, providing the thoughtful reader not tied down by ecclesiastical dogma, new ways of thinking about the beginning of Christianity.<br /><br />Particularly enlightening is how Dr Aslan logically relates events in ways that diverge from Christian tradition, letting us see them through the eyes of the people back then who were fully immersed in their own times.  For example, the simple realization that to Stephen, the fact that Jesus was not left on the cross to be eaten by crows, but was placed in a luxurious tomb, made Jesus stand out among all the other self-proclaimed messiahs and zealous insurrectionists who had died the same execution (pg 164).  I will give no more examples, for much of the joy of reading this book is discovering these jewels for oneself.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book with surprise ending; love the unexpected.  Can't wait to see the movie.  Keep writing Nicholas Sparks you have many fans
B00E5BQ9SW|1.0|By J, you are so right.  This is exploitation of fans, pure and simple, driving price up by making a limited number available.  A hundred dollars a copy?  Screw them (and I very seldom use this kind of language)!
1449408656|5.0|This book is utterly hilarious to anyone who has ever owned a cat. Makes a great gift for cat loves as well!
0440246318|5.0|I enjoy the Reacher and have read all of them.  This is by far the best of the series.  It is a 400 plus page book and I read it in a day.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time.  A very sad ending though.  Would recommend it.
0812550706|3.0|yup.....as well known as is this sci fi &#34;classic&#34;, I found it largely predicatble particularly in its three larger &#34;mysteries&#34;...the premise itself is interesting - and to discuss without ruining the plot can be only be done briefly....children taken from parents to train to fight alien force. Its a quick read. I read it on suggestion of friend, who thought it should be done before seeing movie. Perhaps.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This is a touching, incredibly realistic account that so many of us just wonder about. Thanks to Anita for sharing her unique experience with such simple clarity, and facts that may be researched for further proof for those in doubt. I recommend this book to anyone that is seeking knowledge of what death is all about. It is a fascinating subject for me that has occupied hours, days, months of my thoughts and, morbid as this may sound, I do look forward to the experience even before reading this book. Now, I am convinced that our journey on earth is a path to another plane that is also exciting; and limitless.
B003NRYMZQ|4.0|This may be a spin-off from Dr. Who, but it's for a more mature audience.  An alien who feeds off of orgasmic energy?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is fun but fairly challenging and tricky. Its controls are sometimes fairly slow but other than that it is really fun
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like this product better than the Weather Channel App.  It gives excellent information and is easy to scroll through the screens.
B004SXKRQC|5.0|A story spanning 30 years, told from two points of view simultaneously without ever being confusing, that features understated but excellent performances from a wonderful cast, including three Oscar winners.
B00BB8LTWI|1.0|I hereby nominate Judith Dench for the worst acting job in the history of the world.  She has no sense of her role, opting, instead, to verbally abuse every unfortunate who gets within shouting distance, for no reason what-so-ever.  That's all she does.  She is not a leader; she is an old battle-axe.<br /><br />The opening scene where she directs the action in Turkey, while sitting back in London, with absolutely no idea what is actually happening, qualifies as the most improbable sequence in all of the James Bond movies. I mean, Bond and his Bond girl are chasing this guy all over Istanbul, and every few seconds you hear Dench yell, \\"What's going on now?  Go after him!\\"<br /><br />Craig's ridiculously buffed, jug-eared, distracted and bored Bond isn't much better, as it makes one really appreciate Lindsay Lohan's portrayal of Elizabeth Taylor.<br /><br />The plot is so stupid, it makes \\"Attack of the Crab Monsters\\" look like a documentary.  Things like Bond getting submerged in a pond and emerging dry.  Or, Bond getting shot off a speeding train, falling about 50 stories into a river, then going over a waterfall, and ending up in a tropical paradise, making love to the inevitable local beauty.  And then, when he makes his return to London, they make him take a battery of fitness tests to make sure he's in shape!<br /><br />This movie was made to make money, and that it did.  Now we can forget about it.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I had the lite version and then paid it was so fun! I really really think you should get it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is fun. like temple run but its more fun to play. pretty colors and all that shiny stuff.
0446699616|2.0|I have read and enjoyed every John Corey book by Nelson Demille and was waiting eagerly for The Lion to come out in paperback, when I picked it up for $4 at a second hand book store.  I am so glad I resisted the urge to pay the $27.99 full price.  Like many other reviewers it was the funny quips by Corey that kept me smiling and the fast moving storylines that gripped me in prevous books.  I had not long since finished the Lion's Game and was keen to get onto the next episode.  I dont know what happened this time.  The plot was very elaborate and labored, and for the first time in any of his books I found myself looking back over previous pages to pick up the plot and I found myself drifting and having to re-read sectons that I had not absorbed.  As I write this the Yemeni embassy is currently closed and it made it quite interesting at first and helped to relate to the descriptions of the country and culture.  I hope I am not niave but I found the CIA plot very far fetched and the idea of sending an ex NY cop out to the Yemmen to lure out the Lion somewhat daft.  Possibly the first half of the book flowed along ok but after that it disintegrated fast and I had to force myself to complete the book - something I never thought would happen with a Demille/Cory storyline.  The jokey John did not convince me at all - he just annoyed me.  I have enjoyed the detective work Corey did in his other books - it rang true.  This took him out of his depth and left it in the realm of Unforgettable, Unimaginable, Unbelievable and Unrealistic.  Not to mention unworthy of the money time and effort.<br /><br />For those of you not familiar with previous storylines - Kate kills a CIA operative who is involved in a plot to Nuke the Arabian Peninsular so the CIA do a deal with her that they wont press charges if she and her husband keep quiet about the plot - then renege on the deal by sending the couple over to the Yemen to act as lures for a terrorist known as the Lion.  They then double double cross them and attempt to kill them, thereby keeping their mouths shut permanently - leaving them almost single handedly to complete what the might of the CIA and military had been unable to do.  Thats just one double cross - believe me there are many more to the point when I lost track of who was on our side and who was not.  If still in doubt ask yourself would YOU have sent Corey et al to bring in Osama bin Laden??  Big joke right.  Sorry  Mr Demille D- this time.  Must do better.e double cross them and attempt to kill them, thereby keeping their mouths shut permanently - leaving them almost single handedly to complete what the might of the CIA and military had been unable to do.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved being able to watch each episode one right after another on my kindle fire.....can hardly wait until Season 4 is available.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|McDougall is an engaging writer, not quite as crazy as those he includes in his story, but able to transmit his love for running and being alive.  This story left me with conflicted emotions as some of these folks showed poor judgment in various respects not just limited to running in inhospitable and unfamiliar territory.  Do you have to be this type of personality to be an ultra-runner?  Anyway, the overall impression for me was one of energy and a desire to learn to listen to my body again (I'm in my late 60's) while re-connecting with running as an expression of the joy of living.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Part memoir, part expose, this book recounts Piper's experiences prior to prison and while incarcerated. She tells a compelling personal story while exposing the dreadful underbelly of the US prison system. I was both fascinated and horrified.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I can not believe I missed this one for so long!  I love just about everything about this show, except for the idiots who cancelled it!  Did not love the movie as much, but I guess that is because I knew it would be over.  Great mix of space, cow boys, china, action, adventure and humor.<br />Worth the time to take it all in!!!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|this app does what it's going to do ..... math. if you are in need of a calculator, this one works great. it's free which is always nice. if you need one that does the complicated math, this app is not for you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Absorbing, thrilling and exciting it kept me reading until the end.  This aid a  great series and I look forward to reading the third book and watching the second movie.<br /><br />Kevin
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Thought provoking.  Reads as fantasy versus reality.  Difficult to put down. Very good for discussion at a book club.  Now to see the movie.
B009NX88JU|5.0|My husband and I have very few movies we like in common, great movie, very enjoyable, really loved soundtrack! Well done overall!
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|One of the most emotional zombie movies ive ever seen. This movie was really good from beginning to end. :)
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|Simple, fun, mildly challenging &amp; addictive game. I really like it. So far, so good.  Kudos to the devs for bringing us this cool game!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a fun game to pass the time. Not too hard but challenging enough to make you use your brain.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This game is fun! I can play with my preschoolers which makes me feel good, and they like the &#34;quality time&#34;
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|Dumb movie, bad graphics/makeup. The witches were really dumb looking. Blew the whole thing for me because they are in every seen just about. They set it up for a sequel too....what's the point :)
B008133MDK|5.0|Sherlock is classic fun up to date and cinematically beautiful.  The only downside is that genius doesn't happen over night and we must continue to suffer long wait for season 3.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have been impressed with the quality of the video. I can't wait to watch the rest of the season.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|My nephew loves this game!  Its bright and colorful, and keeps his attention for hours!  I have to make him stop and go play outside!  The best part is that he is learning while he is playing.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|This more is really funny.  It's a great buddy comedy and the surprise at the end is worth the ride.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|LOVE THIS!!!!! I can not wait to see it again.  But until I do I will just keep playing this CD.
B00C6B9PX4|4.0|Loved it so much in fact I have not even opened it. You can see the art work on the back when it still is factory sealed.<br /><br />Missing a star because the special features aren't anything.... special.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Different puzzle games rolled into one.  Every level builds on the previous one creating a new challange each time. It doesn't get old.
1781162646|5.0|A little like &#34;Summer of 42&#34;, but other than that it was a good Mystery.<br />Kept me guessing.  Interesting characters.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Very addicting.  Hard to put down the minute I started the game. Well with the price!! Only half way through the levels and am still interested in playing.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|super fast shipping. not to mention this is a classic. not sure what the &#34;special edition&#34; got me, but for the price, who cares! Get this!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I know that I can receive detailed weather while eating at the coffee shop.  I know whether I will have rain or sun to walk in.
B00003CXCD|5.0|There's certainly not much left unwritten about this 60-year-old (!) classic, a screen debut of inimitable Audrey Hepburn as a European princess falling for an American journalist (Gregory Peck) during her stop in Italy while touring the Continent cities.<br /><br />Shortly, if some people are fault-finding about \\"Roman Holiday\\", these may in the end be the very things that make the movie stand out.<br /><br />While Audrey Hepburn's svelte, iconic beauty and trend-setting style skyrocketed from here onwards (including her Best Actress Academy Award for her leading role) and remains undisputed, both director William Wyler and male star Gregory Peck are more indelibly written in the minds of filmgoers with different movies.<br /><br />Wyler had his way with large-canvas epics like \\"Ben-Hur\\" or intimate \\"The Best Years of Our Lives\\", Peck defined \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" with his portrayal of Southern lawyer Atticus Finch.<br /><br />Here, though, Wyler makes the movie never slip into cheap melodrama, while keeping it profound and thought-provoking to the very end. Peck's performance oozes a large dose of machismo, but finally he too lets the wave of emotions prevail.<br /><br />And not to be forgotten - the City of Rome is another major star of the movie, bringing a very refreshing change from the Hollywood of old, where you could see big stars in front of moving pictures in the studio. Probably there is not a viewer who wouldn't like to see the place after seeing this film.<br /><br />Understated and gentle, while at times surprisingly funny and entertaining throughout, \\"Roman Holiday\\" remains as fresh as ever, largely also due to the ever-popular topic - a love affair between a celebrity and a common person.
B008M87GJK|5.0|This App has not been loaded in to my kindle fire yet.  If this gets loaded into my kindle fire I will love to read it.
B000FAGGWQ|4.0|Awesome, but can tell where all the added features were placed. The quality is very good and its basically what we remembered of the original.
0670014893|4.0|I have been a big fan of John LeCarre's work for many years, although recent novels have disappointed somewhat. This one, however, assures that I will be reading his next book to be released. The subject - outsourcing of military and spy operations to private contractors - is quite timely. The pace was quick and entertaining. The story was not up to the heights of the Smiley stories, but was good nonetheless. I recommend it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This dvd is a great at home tool to use especially if this is your first time really working out and trying to get in shape.  It is a quick workout taking 30mins including warm up and cool down and works all parts of your body.  It is split up into circuits containing working on strength, core, and cardio. It also has 3 different levels of intensity and the two assistants focus on making the level easier or more challenging. If you don't like dvds that talk at you, there is an audio option to have music only and no voice, though I recommend you wait until you are familiar with the workout before turning the audio off.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Interesting and fast paced but too many plot holes for a five star rating.  Overall, it was an enjoyable read.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|Was great for the first couple of days, now it force closes all the time and the ads are way too long!!!
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I enjoyed watching this with someone who had not read the book - I liked watching their reactions and hearing their thoughts on the story. Having read the book, I thought that the movie was mostly true to the overall story, though a lot of plot nuances were removed (probably because they don't translate well to the big screen).
B00785P2QC|3.0|Can be slow and boring at start but as your city grows things can speed up quickly. Really enjoying this game.
B0094M2ITG|1.0|I usually hate narrated movies, and this one in particular. With so many movies to choose from, why watch something that seems kind of boring from the start. So I turned it off.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is the best game ever if you like my little pony because I have watched every episode. I usually don't like games where you have to keep up with it and check on it every day but I LOVE this game. and the best part is that it is free!
B004SIP7S0|5.0|Salma Hayek doesn't disappoint. She brings Frida Kahlo to life with dignity, humor and grace. She deserved the Academy Award for this performance. Alfred Molina also does an excellent job as her husband, Diego Rivera. This is a great movie - very well done. For all Frida Kahlo fans.
B009AJD5E0|5.0|One awesome movie . Recommended , this looked like a prequel to the ALIENS movies . Full of action and suspense .
B0007LGCA4|5.0|The comfortable soles of these sandals make walking long distances no problem. The rest of the sandal is just as well made and comfortable. They are very easy to take on and off also. The reinforced toe area has saved me from a few stubbed toes while walking around. I'm sure I will be buying a second pair to keep in the car in the near future.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Actors are charming - the older lawyer reminds me of George Clooney a tad.  It's a fun premise for a show.  The dialogue is witty and smart.  Love the original plots.  Great photography.  Am really enjoying this show.  It's growing on me.  My brother watches it, too, and loves it.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I had picked up Glee partway thru the second season, and reverted to watching the first one on Amazon Prime.  Hands down the best season!
B00AEFXN46|5.0|Great movie that was on Dish Network just months ago. I hadn't seen it since back when it was released at the movie theater years ago. Glad to buy it, after seeing it again after many years. GREAT MOVIE!!! What bad can you say about Jack Nicholson, in any of his movies. Five Easy Pieces is another great flick, with Jack Nicholson. He is a MASTER of the film industry. His portrayal as a Lawyer fits in this flick. This movie should be part of your library for years of enjoyment. Haven't received the Blu-Ray Disc that I ordered yet, but it will be here in a few days. CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH IT AGAIN!!!!
B000SEIK2S|3.0|I loved &#34;The Forever War&#34;. This was not as good, but if you have an undying desire to be a space marine, then this is worth a read, assuming you have exhausted other classics in this genre.
B000TO0T4O|5.0|It was amazing with a lot of action and the stunts were just amazing every thing was amazing and really thought through<br /><br />Signed,<br />Minecraft Minecraft
B001DHXT6G|4.0|The actual episodes are excellent.  They have improved the special effects without eliminating dialogue or story line.  Better than original!  (assuming that is possible for those of us old enough to see them broadcast)  The packaging leaves something to be desired.  Looks really good, but the looks are only skin deep.  The cards telling what is on each disc (multiple episodes) are separate from the disks themselves.  One of exterior cases cracked during shipment.  Overall probably 4.5 stars or so.  If you are a fan of the original series, I can easily recommend the purchase.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|This hit is huge. I've listened to it many times on the radio and finally, the DJ said who sang it. So here I go,,,,back to Amazon and<br />now I have the personal pleasure of listening to it on my computer, when I want. I really recommend this one.Bob
B0015XHQTE|5.0|As a fan of the original movies in the theater,  I do not need to watch them to know they are great.  You are buying the original, uncut, movies with a letter from Clint Eastwood.  Plus a little book with a synopsis of each film with dead body counts included!  Incredible bargain considering the quantity of material.  Highly recommended.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Amazing season, full of suprises! If you haven't started watching Downtown you need to start now. Can't wait for season 4!!!
B004EPZ07U|3.0|The second time around for this movie was better than the first time I viewed it many years ago (at least of what I remember it)<br />Good story line and I liked the extended cut.  Perhaps I watched the theatrical version before and wasn't that impressed.  Over all good movie.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I really liked this show. Also, since I came upon this during summer hiatus, this was a much welcomed addition to my missing usual lineup. I think the best way to describe this would be as Joss Whedon and Aaron Sorkin's love child, with a dash of Psych thrown in. The humor is well placed and well timed. The episodic plots are fun and satisfying while maintaining an over-arching greater plot line that is never far from your mind.
B00C7JFIRC|3.0|I was expecting this to be a lot better than it was.  Pretty lame as far as action and adventure and didn't even come close to the<br />original Wizard of Oz in quality or story.  Not one of James Franco's better roles.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Nice, easy read.  A little slow at the beginning but definitely picks up and holds your attention.  Very suspenseful, with lots of twists.  This was the first Gillian Flynn book I’ve read and I’m interested in reading some of her other books.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Love It, he is a great country artist. Makes you want to tap your foot. Thanks Blake for a good album
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Is relaxing and a challenge.one of best I have played.so after a hard day relax and enjoy.well back to my adventures
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this game. A lot. It's so much fun and so very frustrating at the same time that it keeps me coming back to play again and again.
B000NIWI9K|4.0|I think this 2006 performance is slightly overrated by two reasons -<br />1.  Lovely setting, beautiful staging;<br />2.  Terrific direction and acting;<br />3.  Ultra-lovely protagonists.<br />However, there is a big however, the<br />SINGING level is a bit mediocre if compared to the two Muti sets (1982, 1994) with protagonists Murray/Marshall/Araiza/Morris/Bruscantini/Battle and Schade/Skovhus/Kichschlager/Frittoli/Corbeli/Bacelli.<br />Of the six protagonists, Pisaroni is a visually delux (tall, young, handsome, charismatic) and vocally adequate Gugliemo.  Nicolas Rivenq is a veteran Mozartian and delivers the most stylish singing, but his acting is merely adequate.  Topi Lehtipuu is an almost great Ferrando - beautiful voice, good acting, marvellous singing, only slightly not as stylish as a Mozartian as the likes of Schreier, Araiza, Schade. Very satisfying Ferrando. Miah Persson is a beautiful Fiordiligi, vocally still in her prime, the voice hasn't hardened in 2006 here. Ainhoa Garmendia is an effective Despina, but no rival with Kathleen Battle for Muti in 1982, really. The main draw here is Anke Vondung's Dorabella, for though visually superb, is vocally clearly sub par with the rest of the cast. Indeed, has severe pitch problem coupling with inadequate projection in Dorabella's solo aria.  Her acting however is wonderful and works well in ensembles.<br />Very enjoyable modern Cosi, especially for the guys'roles.
B009AP2G26|5.0|What a wonderful contribution to television. bravo!!!!! the songs and dancing are wonderful! and the cast--great season. thanks glee-love it.
B00746O3X8|1.0|The bad reviews are correct! This product is cheaply made. I am  sending it back. It is no way it can hold 1 camera must less 2 cameras!
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|jesse was just awesome on this album if you are a fan of jesse's vocals this is the album for you
B005D4YOHI|5.0|I love these sandals, this is my third pear in the past ten years. They are well made and take a beating. I have used them to fly fish in and have held up to daily chores. During the summer months these will get 12 hours of use and my feet never hurt. I have wide feet and they fit good. Make sure you get the half size up and you will be happy.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|overall this game is very entertaining...it gets you wanting to play more and more....graphics on this game are superb...very addicting game...What I like about it is the various minion characters you can choose from.....very friendly game for any age....at times it can freeze up on you at a point you wish it hadnt but that can either be the phone it's being played on or the app itself(but that can be improved by developers).....I recommmend this game to anyone....you will have fun and you will enjoy it!!!
B003VS0CWY|5.0|As a little girl I always loved this film, and FINALLY for the first time i own it! The product came as it was described and shipping was within reason.
B000GIXEIG|1.0|This film is so terrible, I don't know where to begin. Suffice to say it stinks as an adventure film, it stinks as a retelling of the Anglo-Saxon epic poem, Grendel is a bad joke--not in the least scary or &#34;evil&#34;. Sad, sad, sad.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|I love everything Cirque du Soleil does.  &#34;Worlds Away&#34; is a delightful and entertaining blend of pieces from several of Cirque's current presentations.
B0011NVC98|3.0|Okay, this film was a fun action film, but the director did not care to stay true to the Anglo-Saxon epic from whence it came. So yes, the &#34;book&#34; is better. Therefore, if you think you can watch this and pass a test on the poem---you are going to belly-flop. However, I do find that showing students the battle with Grendel is educational & entertaining. The character of the historic Beowulf is perfect--that is the epic hero. Therefore, the wishy-washy, lying, jealous, adulterous, and far from perfect Beowulf of this film is nothing as he should be.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app is completely bad. You can't watch a full minute without it stopping. I waited two minutes to load the video, and i only got 15 seconds of it until it stops. You also can't view channels without having an account. You can't see their videos or anything. The search part is also bad. Now that there is no m.youtube for kindle, i can no longer watch YouTube over all. Thanks, app!
B000I2JI80|5.0|This film is great for my TLR. It takes wonderful photos and the color is very vivid. I am very excited with the results/quality of the photos.
0375869026|4.0|The book Wonder by R.J. Palacio is about a boy named August who has a facial deformity. The book is about how he gets through school and how he isn't doing it alone because his sister Via helps and supports everything he does.<br />The type of audience that would like this book would be kids in middle school. The reason that they would like this book is because they can connect and relate to it. For example, at a Halloween party August was bullied and the way it happened is similar to the way it could happen in real life.<br />The thing that stood out for me with this book was that I usually read books with more action and adventure in them. This book is more like everyday life, and doesn't have much action and adventure.<br />I was glad that the story ended well and it all worked out. The actual book wasn't that exciting, and it was hard for me to connect with the main characters. Otherwise the story was all right.
B00DGNOMB6|4.0|Very well acted movie Maggie Smith is the most entertaing part of it,, I enjoyed the relationships that the characters all had with each other, and how they accepted their journey into aging
B0012QCZ54|4.0|I liked the many dance moves and passion for a dream.  The support of family & friends.  It was inspiring.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|More fun than a barrel of monkeys. I love playing uno and this is the best app I have downloaded. The commercials are a pain but all you have to do is buy tokens and good bye commercials. I strongly recommend this app.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Only thing wrong with it is that they haven't finished season 3! Very addicting. Maybe a little sexual tho, for those who aren't into that. Sometimes it feels like tv with brief moments of soft porn.
0684803356|4.0|For Whom the Bell Tolls is Ernest Hemingway running a bit to flab. A master of constructing concentrated scenes of great power, often using dialogue alone, or with vividly rendered details sparsely catalogued, Hemingway I think starts to get lost when he begins piling up the words, and nowhere did he pile them up more than in this work, his longest ever. That's not to say that as a consequence the novel is a failure. In fact, there are many fabulous scenes in this novel, from the excruciating narration of how one village executed its fascist sympathizers and another executed its Republican mayor and his wife, to scenes where characters verbally joust while the underlying tension almost sweats from the walls. There are also vivid battle scenes where we feel the intensity experienced by the characters and another involving a sojourn across the battle lines to deliver an important message.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are also a number of scenes where the dialogue spins off into desultory BS sessions to no great purpose, and extended internal monologues that feel like Hemingway never edited down his raw rough draft. Perhaps worst of all are the intimate interludes between the central character, Robert Jordan, and the heroine Maria, which to me are some of the silliest sex scenes I've ever read (\\"little rabbit\\"?). These scenes cartwheel into the offensive when they imply that the worst thing about the gang rape Maria experienced is that it might be a turn-off for Jordan. Frankly, I found Hemingway's vicarious need through Jordan to be the virile but sensitive manly man to the naive, submissive, sexually and psychically damaged Maria rather creepy.<br /><br />As for the length of For Whom the Bell Tolls, I think it was very deliberate on Hemingway's part. When the novel was published in 1940, Hemingway was coming off a lackadaisical decade in which his only major works were a pair of rather self-indulgent nonfiction works about two of his hobbyhorses, bullfighting (Death in the Afternoon) and big game hunting (The Green Hills of Africa), and the slipshod \\"novel\\" To Have and Have Not, which reminded nobody that the same guy had also written The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms. True, he had also produced a number of very fine short stories (\\"The Snows of Kilimanjaro,\\" \\"The Short Happy Life of Francis MacComber\\") during this period, but Bells to me just seems like Hemingway's deliberate attempt to show that he can produce prose in volume with the best of them. But like I said, that's not playing to his strengths.<br /><br />One other note I would like to mention is Hemingway's take on the internal politics of the Spanish Republican side, which were dysfunctional to say the least. He seems remarkably sanguine about Soviet influence, which seems very naive compared with the much more measured view taken by George Orwell in Homage to Catalonia. Of course, by the time For Whom the Bell Tolls was published, in late 1940, the verdict was in in Spain (the \\"good guys\\" lost) and the fascists (Germany and Italy) and the Communists (the Soviet Union) had gone on to other predations.<br /><br />I'm sorry for dwelling more on the faults than the virtues of this book in this review. I really did enjoy reading it again, but I figured the virtues were already well documented by the many five-star reviews here, so I thought I'd give my thoughts on things that haven't been mentioned as much but which I think are important to keep in mind when reading For Whom the Bell Tolls.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wow Season 3 delivered as many cliffhangers and as much intrigue as the first two seasons and what a finish!  I must admit though that I will greatly miss the main characters that have now left the show.  The chemistry among the cast is outstanding.  Of course, Violet steals the show in every scene in which she appears.  I can't wait to see what Season 4 brings us.

B0094WK9GU|5.0|I LOVE Swedish House Mafia. This CD is amazing. I played it everyday for months after I got it!!!!! It just makes me want to dance and party. All the songs are good! I've never experienced that with a CD. I recommend it
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Best 3D movie I own.<br />Hope to find more as good.<br />Recommend to good family viewing and demostrate your system.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this read. It's a page turner! As others have said, be prepared to spend more time reading than you anticipate because once you start, it's hard to stop.
0452282152|5.0|Not only was my shipping prompt, but they even sent me a personal, hand written note -- which was very unexpected! My book was  in great condition, exactly what I was expecting. With their quick delivery and personal touch, I feel like a valued customer, and I look forward to purchasing more from the farm!

B002VPE1WK|5.0|good quality well build nice pack overall I just wished it came in coyote brown or od green maybe tan or sage
B006G3MZRQ|4.0|Watched this for Tom Hardy.  Loved him in Batman as Baine.  Does a good job in this movie too.  worth watching if you like boxer movies.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Great for relaxation!!!! it's so much fun. playing uno is a wonderful way to pass time. I only wish you. could win more tokens often to play higher stake games. A must play game :)
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Great movie, lots of action, brought me back to my childhood.  Watched it with my kids.  Man I'm getting old!
B00DCX08MW|4.0|Great game! Good graphics and scenarios, but there are a few missing pieces: In the mission briefings, detailed maps should be provided for the varios airfields, as well as a briefing on headings, speeds, altitudes, etc; a cpmprehensive explanation of each plane needs to be included (covering cruise and landing speeds); and a more complete explanation of the controls would be helpful.<br />After crashing several times, you can finally get the idea of each mission, but a lot of wasted &#34;learning curve&#34;. Overall, fun to play.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|SO MUCH FUN! HAS a great ring to the game and always keeps me busy! My friends and I always play it!
B0012QTT4O|5.0|I just started watching this show and withing a couple of weeks have already watched through season 4. You really need to start on the first show and watch them in order. I don't think they make good stand alone shows. The writing is fantastic by bringing in many \\"issues\\" that most married family men will relate to while having plenty of dark fiction to make it the modern day Godfather. It is very good, although, dark. But be careful. Once you start, it's hard to stop.

1936891026|1.0|If you are a modern person living in this century, then this book is not for you.<br /><br />Here's an example from the book:<br /><br />\\"You shame the angels who watch over you and you spite the Almighty, who created you and only you with your unique gifts, for the sole purpose of nudging the human race one millimeter farther along its path back to God.\\"<br /><br />Holy out-of-touch-with-reality, Batman!<br /><br />Where to begin?  This childish and narcissistic view of life is laughable in our modern day world.  I half expected him to reach his hands out of the book and exclaim \\"You are healed! Cast Satan out!\\"<br /><br />Yeah, it's that bad.<br /><br />What does religion have to do with writing?  Nothing.  Ask the couple of hundred dudes who wrote the bible...  (talk about lack of minority voices -- there's a work of fiction that could've used some women and people of color chipping in!  That might've resulted in a few less million deaths in the holy wars the religious types were so fond of.)<br /><br />Come on! If there were a god, then there never would've been a Transformers II. Or any Transformers movie, for that matter.<br /><br />The bottom line: real writers *must* write.  Nothing can stop them.  If you're not a real writer, you ain't gonna write.  And no divine intervention can change that.  Because.... oh yeah, there's no such thing.<br /><br />Signed,<br /><br />The Modern Erause it will suck.  And just make me sad that you can't find meaning in reality instead of superstition.  Not that you care, because your special invisible magic man in the sky loves you so you don't really need us Earthlings, do ya?<br /><br />The sad thing is that the kind of people who buy this crap are exactly the kind of unimaginative and frightened little minds that can't write well anyway.  Writing well involves critical thinking and the ability to examine things deeply -- the opposite of the qualities that make a person religious.  Faith is pretending you're stupid so you can pretend to believe in angels and santa and fairies and weapons of mass destruction.  None of which are real.<br /><br />Come on! If there were a god, then there never would've been a Transformers II. Or any Transformers movie, for that matter.<br /><br />The bottom line: real writers *must* write.  Nothing can stop them.  If you're not a real writer, you ain't gonna write.  And no divine intervention can change that.  Because.... oh yeah, there's no such thing.<br /><br />Signed,<br /><br />The Modern Era

B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|Fantastic film! Tom Cruise was truly at his best. Special mention to Drone 166! You will watch this film over and over, just to soak up the story line and the CGI effects.
B007XNAQPG|5.0|I was highly interested in checking out \\"A Diamond In The Mind Live 2011\\" by Duran Duran dvd set due to my familiarity with some of their music collections and the fun I had after attending one of their exciting concerts back in 2011. The \\"A Diamond In The Mind Live 2011\\" is a two dvd set showcasing some of Duran Duran's classic hits in a concert format. The first disc features at least 19 of their songs that are performed live. There are many good songs in the live action portion, however \\"A View To A Kill\\" and \\"Ordinary World\\" are among my favorites in this musical edition. Tunes  from the 2011 collection of \\"All You Need Is Now\\" such as \\"Safe\\" (In The Heat Of The Moment) and \\"Girl Panic\\" are also included in the live concert performances.  Disc 2 features a 2011 documentary that showcases the camaraderie and closeness among the band-members. There are also the classic and satisfying hits songs of \\"Come Undone\\" and \\"Is There Something I Should Know\\" concert features within the bonus section of the second dvd. \\"A Diamond In The Mind Live 2011\\" dvd is fantastic for those who enjoy many of the 80's and 90's songs from Duran Duran and/or those who have enjoyed and/or  attended any of the Duran Duran concerts.
0714843377|5.0|This book has taught me so much. it contains substantial information and it opens your mind and eyes on how you should should think and perceive  yourself in the business area! overall GREAT BOOK!
B008JFUN50|5.0|\\"Elysium\\" is a futuristic type of film that illustrates what could happen if members of the wealthiest income strata decided to create completely separate living regions from other socio-economic classes.  I truly wish that I could say that what is depicted in \\"Elysium\\" will never happen on earth and that harmony and unity is going to reign supreme within the next 25 years at the latest. However, it looks like a more unified world may not come about until at least 250 years from now. Additionally, it is becoming even more easy for the top 1% to create their own communities due to the socio-economic and racial segregation that still exists in many middle socio-economic class  and lower socio-economic class neighborhoods across America. There was an element of the immigration debate within the film. I have to confess that I am on the fence and undecided about the immigration issue because I would have to gather more information before making an informed decision on the still controversial matter. \\"Matt Damon\\" gave a compelling performance as a man who unexpectedly carries the responsibility of making the amenities of Elysium more accessible to a greater number of men and women. Jodie Foster  also gives a brilliant performance as an abrasive and shrewd politician who wants to preserve the culture of \\"Elysium\\" at even the most extreme of costs. The following actors and actresses are also included in \\"Elysium\\": Diego Luna, Alice Braga,Sharlto Copley, Faran Tahir,Wagner Moura, William Fichtner, Brandon Auret, Josh Blacker, Emma Tremblay, Jose Cantillo, Adrian Holmes, Jared Keeso, Adrian Holmes, Jared Keeso, Carly Pope, and Ona Grauer. \\"Elysium\\" is great for those who are curious to watch futuristic \\"potential\\" type of films.
0064471837|5.0|Born with the unique gifts and abilities of an Abhorsen, Sabriel's dreams of possibly having a normal life in Ancelstierre are torn asunder as a shadowy creature delivers both the sword and bells of her father.  Realizing that he is trapped within the rivers of Death, she is quickly off to begin the adventure of trying to not only save her father, but to also save both the kingdom of her birth as well as Ancelstierre.  With the help of a witty white cat that serves the family called Mogget, the teen-age Sabriel is left to face the hardest lessons both life, and Death, have to offer.  From the moment the first book is picked up to the second the third is finally put down, readers will be unable to help but keep pressing forward in this page turner.  Containing themes of life, loss, friendship, and a sprinkle of love, it is both a wonderful book for teens as well as adults who enjoy fantasy.  Easily one of the best books, and series, of our time and certainly one of the best Australian literary works to have emerged and taken the world by storm.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|If you are the kind of person who likes both sides of a story and are interested in American history this is a must read. It made me both sad and angry but it opened my eyes wider and reminded me that history is written by the winner. The story of how the Native American has been the victim of eurocentric is as saddening as the story of slavery in the new world.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|This movie gets better every time I watch it.  It's just a great movie.  The plot keeps you engaged, and the characters all have something to add to the story.
0307948110|4.0|A very enjoyable mystery with high tech, high finance overtones. Fast paced, with interesting characters. A scenario that is not so far-fetched as to land it in the sci-fi category. Thrilling and imaginative!
B008476HBM|5.0|This book is a wonderful book that is delghtfully witty and entertaning. It portrays the stunning similarities between modern and older societies as well as our prides and prejudices.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Usual excellent BBC production values, stunning scene quality and settings.  Acting is fairly good, too.  The only faults I would list are that sometimes the scene shifts are too abrupt, which takes away from thorough character development, and the writing which sometimes seems strained or forced.  That is, compared to the first two seasons, for which the story lines seemed richer.  All in all, however, this show is better to watch than about 95% of all broadcast, satellite, or streamed media.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app is fun.  my daughter enjoys it.  seems like there could be more to do though.  a little boring
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Amazing research.  He really brought the era to life, and especially Lee and Marina Oswald.  Crazy good.  I'm glad I've been watching Doctor Who and I know about fixed points in time.
B004Y6MIXS|5.0|It was a bit expensive, but for a good reason! I can see many networks that I couldn't see before. The range is crazy! Worked right out of the box in Kali, and Ubuntu. I assume it will work well for both Windows and Mac also. 5/5!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I really enjoy this puzzle game!!  It is both challenging and relaxing. You wind up with a lovely work of art .
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|For a group that is famous for cover songs, the original songs on this album are amazing. W.O.T.E. is one of the best bands today and this album R.E.V.O. is one reason why. Give it a listen and you'll be a convert.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book had me hooked from the moment I picked it up. This was my first book by Gillian Flynn and I'm planning on catching up on some of her past books.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a TV Show this much since Lie To Me. I got hooked from the first episode. Totally worth watching!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Love the book as much as the TV Series! Though the books seem way different then the TV series still it's well written
B008OOYALE|4.0|This game is so pretty & you get to make friends.  It's fun to play, because it's not a timed game; you can put it down or pick it up anytime you want.  I usually play 4-5 X's a day.  There's the element of surprise, because, you don't always know what kind of dragon you're gonna get, who'll win the battles, or when you're gonna be surprised with a bonus or reward. It's a progressive game and allows you to create your world to suit yourself.  My only complaints: 1) the costs for everything (in \\"game\\" money) are a exorbitant and it takes a long time to amass enough to start breeding dragons. I've heard those who play on Kindle, rather than Android or Apple products don't have to pay nearly as much for stuff in the gamer : 2) if you are too hasty naming your island, you have to pay a lot to change it: 3) you can't restart the game once you've begun, you have to keep playing the one you started.  Be that as it may, I'll be playing this game for many, many months to come.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love it!!!!!!! I really enjoyed the challenge. keep throw rooms coming I didn't want to put it down. great game.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I am 56 years young and I just love this movie!  So when the grandkids come by, I love to play it for them.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|An inspiring story and a beautiful reminder of what life is all about. I am utterly touched by the author's experience.
B000IZ7YMY|2.0|I was quite upset over this film, after seeing the 1939 Classic.  The newer film strays much away from the novel, unlike the previous 1939 classic, which follows closer to the plot line of the 1902 publication.  The acting in the previous was actually a lot better too. Also the movie in general, although Heath Ledger plays Haversham quite well, seemed quite bland and too Hollywood for my interests.  Heath Ledger doesn't even look like a Sudanese native, when he tries to blend in with the populace with his disguise. I thought it laughable when the Mahdi warrior allowed him entrance into their warrior clan.  I liked that in this film, unlike the previous, Haversham has a sidekick Sudanese warrior loyal to the British who helps him out in the sticky situations, but even with this additive, the movie still was too mainstream Hollywood for my interests.<br /><br />If you're looking for a superb film documenting the Sudanese conflict of the 1880s, you should check out the 1939 film of the same name, which even today, fills me with awe over its superb cinematic qualities.<br /><br />All in all, I felt this film was too mainstream for my interests.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|&#34;Zealot&#34; offers a different perspective of Jesus than one based strictly on the Bible. It's interesting to read about him based on historical background. The book is well written and well researched (pages and pages of notes and sources).
B007XGJK4G|5.0|Best of the Bob Marley biographies I've seen so far!<br />This gave me a more complete and accurate feel to clips I saw in other documentaries or biographies on him. Loved the conflicting viewpoints from interviews with different persons. I saw the visitors to Bob's place, further details on his life in the US, details on tours and relationships I never saw before. It took us to the end of his life's journey in a rather comprehensive way. Kudos!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|If you are watching Dowton Abbey Season 3, then you are probably already hooked on the show.  I think this season delivers again on the gorgeous sets and costumes, character development, and crazy plot twists.  Without giving too much away, there are some events that occur this season that angered a lot of fans.  These events were caused by decisions from the actors, not the show creators, so don't blame the show!  Looking forward to Season 4!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Suits is a good show. It is entertaining and you don't want to stop watching it. I recommend it to people who like the White Collar show.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like this game a lot it seems to keep drawing me back into it. Does take time to save up a decent amount of Money though. I like to watch movies and play my games so it works perfectly for me.
B0015XASFS|5.0|I knew nothing of Josh Groban until given a CD of his as a gift.  I couldn't stop listening, even when I couldn't understand the words.  I learned all I could about him on the internet; because how could one so young be so talented.  Yet there he was!  I had to get all of his CD's and now to see his concert - amazing.  I especially enjoyed the extras on the CD where Josh talks a little about himself and his crew and the talented people he has been able to work with.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Interesting but felt disconnected - each part of the story was only barely connected to the others. Loved the first two novels but found this one disappointing by comparison.
0553062182|2.0|I was totally bored with the book and the information in it seemed more like excuses than useful, credible information. I am shocked that there are so many good reviews.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Like many people, I ordered Google's Chromecast as soon as it was available, swayed by the $35 price point. After setting it up, I'm not disappointed at all with this purchase.<br /><br />The Chromecast's main draw is the ability to immediately stream (&#34;cast&#34;) content from an Android phone or desktop PC running the Chrome browser to an HDMI-compatible TV. Right now, the Chromecast is compatible with the Netflix, Google Music, and Youtube apps, and you can also cast Chrome tabs.<br /><br />Setup is a fairly easy process, as long as your wi-fi works: just plug in the Chromecast into your TV, switch to the correct HDMI input, and follow the prompts on screen.<br /><br />All in all, the Chromecast works well, albeit sometimes stuttering or requiring a quick refresh when using it for web browsing. Right now the device is more about the potential (new developments are occurring almost weekly, with Cyanogenmod announcing Chromecast support in future versions) than what it's capable of. Either way, it's a great little device.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game! My daughter loves playing this game and has gotten me addicted. I like scavenger hunt games so it's perfect.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Not as good as the book.  But I think they did a good job with it.  There were a few areas they really glossed over ie Peta giving her the bread.  But all in all, i enjoyed it.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|i didn't go into this movie expecting a masterpiece, as i saw the first movie. in comparison, this movie dwarfs its predecessor in terms of action, dialogue, and overall fun. it did have some pretty big flaws but once again, i had appropriate expectations. it's a good movie for the people who know what to expect - i'd recommend that people who gave it low ratings try it again if possible looking to be more entertained than intellectually stimulated.
B00447G2PM|4.0|I love snorkeling in the tropical waters of Key West, swimming around the heads of coral and interacting with the beautiful sea life.  This video in 3D, though not of Key West, really gives you the feeling of being in the sea.  The depth and movements are great.  The only thing distracting is that the narrators seem sort of stiff and the script itself can be a bit flat at times.  But regardless, this is still a buy recommendation from me.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have found such good recipes and crafting ideas that made wonderful christmas presents. The app is a little harder to run than the website but its still good.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|great fun. game keeps me thinking and I hope exercising my brain. similar games are more complicated. this is a bit easier with fewer steps.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|First watch &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34; then buy the CD to hear some interesting words interpreted as well played music; repeat over and over.
B0054SMID0|4.0|He was so cocky and egotistic but I loved him in this movie! It didn't drag at all and kepy my interest!
B00AB7HESI|4.0|So, this is a fun game and I've been a Nintendo fan, so I got the game.  After I finished all the starter levels, I got the expansion pack.  But after a week, the levels were gone. I checked back again, but they were still gone. Fix this and I will rate 5.
0756655307|4.0|This is a good book, awesome graphics, and a lot of pointless information for comic con nerds all around the world.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I ordered this for my 5 year old. She loves dinosaurs. The game is easy for her to play and she loves it.
B00770KR7W|5.0|I really like this action figure, good graphics and fun to look at it in it's original box (collector's item).
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. I can't put it down. Very addicting. Great game and the characters are so cute. Thanks.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|After many years invested into this series, I got an ending that was satisfying overall. It wasn't perfect, but I enjoyed it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I loved this game growing up. It is different from the older version, but still fun the play. Thank you.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|drama. romance. humor. the cost of hubris. aesthetic beauty. whimsy. wry social class commentary. historical fiction that sings of the human experience.<br />I love this show.

B0042U94UQ|5.0|I preordered Despicable Me 2 because I took my 10 year old Grandson to see it. He loved it and I loved it. We decided we had to order Despicable Me, also. I had forgotten all of the wonderful and funny scenes in it. Love this movie.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I ain't much on downloading music but this is the stick. Easy and fast and if u travel take your music.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|what I was told,it was a good movie.  what I watched was fabulous and original. tom is back on top. could not shut off to use the facilities.  must see for series movie watchers.  adults only I think.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app was the perfect solution for waking up early.  I used to sleep through my alarms and i got this app and it was the cure.  Ever since I got this app, i have been getting up on time, which is important since school starts this week.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|very watchable,not even close to the british take.  incredible cast,didn't do their best.  the writers dropped the ball. should of been a block buster,the british series with ian is.
B007SSEZNA|5.0|Great movie based on the classic book! Funny and light-hearted but also has its serious parts. Different spin on a love story
B003FCVF6I|5.0|This book is hands-down one of the best ever written on the history of videogames.  I have read it several times and I never tire of it.  Published in 2002, the book only chronicles up to the death of the Sega Dreamcast and the birth of the Nintendo GameCube and Microsoft Xbox, but it is easily the most thorough book on the rich and storied history of the video game industry from its humble beginnings until then.
B00C7KYXHW|3.0|The content in the show is really interesting, but the audio is very low and the accent of Hannibal's character is so strong that it's hard to understand what he's saying a lot of the time.  Don't watch if you have a queasy stomach!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Excellent mental challenge exercises! Fun to work as a team with my kids to strengthen their logical processes. Just wish there were more rooms. Looking forward to playing more again soon!
B001K3K5MO|5.0|THE SURROUND SOUND WAS FANTASTIC. THAT IS WHAT REALLY MADE THE MOVIE GREAT. A MUST SEE IF YOU HAVE SURROUND SOUND
B0081336FO|5.0|This is not a tv show- it is a phenomenon. \\"Sherlock\\" is the best thing I have seen in years. Not only is the writing, music, cinematography, and style completely perfect- the cast is beyond compare. Benedict Cumberbatch is the greatest actor of our time. His partner, Martin Freeman, is just as amazing. I am completely in love with this show, and I am anxiously awaiting season 3 and beyond. You cannot miss this!
B002HLM4E0|5.0|great fun for the whole family. A &#34;bit&#34; scary for the younger ones.. perfect for our 10 year old. rent it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was introduced to Downton Abbey by a friend just a few short weeks ago. I devoured the first two seasons when I watched them on a demand feature our network, but didn't know they had already completed the third and fourth season until last week. I got onlne to Amazon and found the third season. I ordered it on Monday and received it on Wednesday and finished watching it on Friday night.I went through all the emotions in this season's collection, from celebrations to laughter, to a change of opinion of one of the characters to tears. I'm so anxious to see the new fourth season this January. Thank you Amazon for carrying such an assortment of products. It seems like you have everything we could be looking for at a reasonable price and speedy delivery.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Ive been playing bingo blitz for years and i used to love it. Now, after all the changes, it just plain sucks.  They pretty much try to force you to pay for credits. Guess someone got to greedy and in turn is now taking the fun out of this game.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I play mtg with my friends from time to time and now being able to play mtg everywhere I go is great.

B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is so awesome!!!!!!!! I am totally obsessed with this game, to me, this is Gameloft's best game yet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!=)
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|If it's one thing G5 knows how to do, is create an innovative, surprising, well-thought out Hidden Object Game (HOGs to us hide-and-seek fans). The graphics are well done, very eye-catching, vivid colors with depth and scope. They intersperse HOG's throughout the game, along with cause-and-effect games. The plots are genuinely interesting with nice twists and turns. They know how to keep someone playing for hours on end.<br /><br />What I don't like, is how they trick people into buying the game.  On some of them, they don't tell you it's only a free trial until you're 4-5 chapters into the game.  They really should be up front before you click download. They aren't that expensive, around $3-5 per game but how sneaky they go about it is bad form.<br /><br />I do like G5 games for the above reasons, so play if you want to spend the money.Ingenious mix of hidden object, leading clues, different realms! Hints available when you are stuck, wished the monkey could do more, interact.
B007SOQBCM|3.0|It's great because it shows most streams but not all of them. It has improved but still needs work. It barely works on HD and you can't use the chat. Its a nice try but could be better.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I read this bc it was recommended by a friend. Overall the story was good. It was slightly more tweeny than I expected. I think I wouldn't have had issues with it if the characters were closer to 20 than 12.  I just didn't buy that 15 year olds we're allowed out in clubs and to do whatever they wanted
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is soooo fun! It's adorable lol I love the minions! Yes it's like subway surfer but who freaking g cares they are MINIONS!!!!!
B005544V6A|5.0|Great casting.  Cool show. The lawyers have big time swag.  There are bits of humor, I have also cried, with some of the serious situations. There  are different plots and themes, going on all the time in each episode.
B002MFX27E|5.0|I love anything these two women star in anyway, but putting them together in this funny story was brilliant!  Fabulous!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The entire cast is simply awesome!  I recommend everyone to tune in and watch it for a pleasant surprise.  Watch!
B002ZBPPJ8|5.0|Great movie to watch with someone special, I enjoyed the chemistry between Keanu Reeves, and Sandra Bullock.  Time shift is an interesting plot device.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|When I first heard about this movie and saw the trailer I wasn't sure what to expect or even if I would like it. I haven't had the movie but a few days and I have already watched it several times. It picks up not long after the end of season three ... in fact the first five minutes of the movie could have been a tag ending to the last episode of season three. Taking Twilight to the human world was necessary for this story to work. This is her journey of coming into her own as a Princess and becoming comfortable with her new self. All of the \\"mane\\" six personalities are there and nothing skips a beat while in the alternate human world. I really did not get the sense that this is just to sell or expand the toy line. I imagine that they will, it would be bad business not to. But, this movie doesn't come across as just a commercial for new products. The story told has a purpose and fits right in and flows from and back into the MLP:FIM world we are familiar with in a very natural, smooth way. The songs are good, the humor is classic cartoon slapstick with a touch of sarcasm placed sparingly here and there ... pretty much about the same as the show itself. There are a lot of nods to jokes and little things from the series here and there to look for as well as human versions of many of the background ponies that are fun to spot. The extras are also decent. The interviews with the creative staff were the best part of the extras for me. They shed light on how they came to this point and where they plan to go, the state of the series, the wide range of demographics the series reaches and that sort of stuff. There are also behind the scenes on the art design and music that are an interesting watch. Overall this is a good blu-ray/dvd set. The picture looks fine and sound comes through clean and crisp. If you are a fan of the show this is a good addition to your MLP collection. I was pleasantly surprised ... good job MLP staff!!
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|Delerium was a great story about two young girls graduating from high school and facing their lives as adults. The girls went through experiences that any 18 yr. old would go through, but along with that are the constant rules and threats of their society that they have to deal with. I especially liked how Lena, the main character, tries really hard to follow the rules for a while, but then finds herslef in a situation that makes her find the inner strength and courage that she never realized she had.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I purchased this book to read while on vacation. It wasn't so heavy and engrossing that I found myself doing nothing but reading this book. I think the book was fine as a light summer read.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Pandemonium continues the Delirium series and Lena finds herself in one difficult situation after another. Just when you think you know what's going to happen, there will be another twist and turn.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I found myself a little bored (even with the love scenes) in the middle of the book. It was a good light Summer read though.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|The chapters go back and forth between characters and as the plot thickens the chapter lengths vary accordingly, which kept me on the edge of my seat wanting to know what would happen next. I also especially like the message at the end of the story and think it is a message we can all take to heart.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It was fine for a light summer read, but I found the ending to the story to be anticlimactic and rushed.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|The knife itself is great. Very thick and sturdy, however the nylon sheath it comes with actually scratches the finish off of the blade. With the quality of this knife it should come with a much better sheath.
B005MJFA2W|5.0|Kahneman provides an devastating critique of the inner workings of the mind, challenging many pre-conceived notions of freedom of choice, the importance of first impressions and the power of 'group think'. If you're an executive, interested citizen or an at-home parent READ THIS BOOK! You'll look at everyday life and the things you have previously taken for granted in a whole new light (of reason and insight).
B008Q09K2U|4.0|Writes a very good, intriguing story and consistently turns out good novels.  Disappointed in the ending of this one - didn't have impact that the story line had set up.
1401938906|5.0|I bought this as a Kindle edition, and have enjoyed it so much I wanted a paper version of it.
0525478817|1.0|I ordered this book a while back, and it is now 2 weeks late. I dont even know who to contact to try to get it. I paid 10 dollars for it, and it was supposed to be a gift.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|As with his first two books, I was immediately drawn in and captivated so that I couldn't put this book down.  The characters were intricate and the way they all intertwined was intriguing.  A tragic story that not only has you reaching for the kleenex box but also makes you stop and analyze your relationships...how are we treating loved ones, what is really driving us to make the selfish choices we make?
B005HEPS6A|5.0|great show. I remember watching these 20+ years ago--timeless scenarios with ethical implications and moral lessons. good for kids too.
0345803485|5.0|this book had me in awe after the first escapade. It' s nice to have a book take you fully into that world. Bad reviews of this book, should not phase you. YOu have to make your own judgement. I loved this book. Cannot wait to finish the next two books. I cannot wait to see who they cast in the movie!!!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This is such a fun game! I love to play and the challenges are a twist that is added fun, I just wish there could be unlimited games without having to purchase coins.
B00B4Z5J92|3.0|I thought the first half was interesting but then the second half became a \\"Look at Me I'm Dave Grohl\\" documentary. Stopped watching it when Paul Mc Cartney started playing on a tune with Dave Grohl. Yeah Dave, you're super talented but I find you to be a little full of yourself.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Just an awesome app there are other apps like temple run or subway surfers but this one is the best
B00BHXUC4S|5.0|Just another masterpiece by Jeff Lynn with special guests George Harrison, Tom Petty and more.  Lynn has proven himself as a noteworthy songwriter and established musician.  A must have for any music lover, Lynn fan or foe.  Shut up and listen.
B00AFEQA5K|5.0|I know that this movie offended  lot of people. I loved Matthew McConaughey as Killer Joe. I think he is extremely talented and really went out on a limb with this one. Hats off to Thomas Hayden Church, and the entire cast. Can't wait to see more of Juno Temple who was outstanding as Dottie. Don't expect a light hearted comedy with this one.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like having this app readily available. I like to check the radar maps to see what is going on locally. They are up to date and warn about nasty conditions like hail, tornado or severe weather predictions. Would like to see the maps load faster.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Was dying to read this book but decided to read her first two books and then read this one.  The first two books were great so I was very excited to read Gone Girl.  I have to say I was somewhat disappointed with the story and almost stopped reading it half way through.  I was mad at the ending as well but was glad I did stick with it.  A friend of mine also read this book and she had the same reaction I did.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|The PinSeeker technology in the Busnell rangefinders is the best I've ever seen. I also like the fact that it's small and compact. I had a Callaway rangefinder (by Nikon) earlier in the year but it didn't find the pin as quickly or as reliably as this Bushnell model. It got to the point with the Callaway model that I couldn't really rely on it so I sold it on eBay and bought this one. If you're looking for a great rangefinder for a good price, this is the one to buy.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Again, Khaled Hosseini has touched my heart with one of his books.  Read this book, you will not be disappointed!!!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Seemed to lack any real direction. Really disappointed, seems liek the book was written just to had another book to the sequel.
B00ABO573A|1.0|This is a terrible movie with almost no story or character development. There is a bunch of nudity and drug use. The main character is totally unlikeable gets hooked on drugs cheats on his boyfriend and sinks into a stupor the end. Don't waste your time, there is better eye candy to be found without the terrible story.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Enjoyed the action and the connection to the same characters. I am looking forward to seeing the movie and hope to see consistency.
B00795P4EG|2.0|I feel fairly certain that i just dont know what im doing because quite simply I DONT...<br />I DO WANT TO LEARN.  WILL BE A JOB FOR MY FUTURE. SON-IN-LAW.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|challenging... I like it. its great for the price. got to level 10 and cant move on till I do. I hope the following levels stay up to par.
B0077EBWVI|5.0|The old movie was really good and generally when they do a remake it's not as good but I think it's just as good as the first one.
B0086700CM|5.0|great game for kids because some kids love vileness and it might inspire kids to run a marothon so you should play it
140006922X|5.0|As a PhD who has been teaching the New Testament for thirty-five years at the university level, I find Dr. Reza Aslan's book long overdue.  Even if Zealot is a history written for a popular audience, it is important to have an occasional scholar provide us with \\"the big picture\\" of what is going on in an area of academic research. This, Aslan does very well.  His end-notes and bibliography are thorough, informative, and demonstrate an in-depth familiarity with the salient arguments concerning Christianity and the New Testament.  The book is well written, and in a style and tone that makes it very hard to put down.  The work is organized into three major sections: (1) what we know about 1st century Judea; (2) what Jesus the man was like (the flesh-and-blood peasant laborer from Nazareth), and the religio-political nature of his Galilean messianic movement; and (3) how the zealous views of Jesus and his immediate followers were dramatically altered into something non-Jewish by Paul and the Gentile community.<br /><br />The first section explicates the dozens of messianic movements that plagued Judea following the death of Herod the Great in 4 BCE.  These rebellions tell us much about the historical times and circumstances in which Jesus lived.  Aslan reminds us of the apocalyptic Zeitgeist that suffused the whole of Judea (and particularly Galilee), and the powder keg of discontent that Jesus was responding to.<br /><br />The second section is gripping: Reza Aslan marshals a tour-de-force argument that Jesus is best understood as a staunch critic of both the Roman occupation of Judea (and the destruction of the agricultural roots of the Judean economy), and the corruption of the Herodian elites and the High Priests of the Temple.  Jesus calls for justice and a return to the \\"Kingdom of God\\" ... not some ethereal and otherworldly kingdom, but the notion embraced by many zealots, that GOD should be in charge of Judea, not the Romans.  Jesus' resistance to both Rome andthe Temple leads logically to his arrest and execution for \\"sedition,\\" an attempt to overturn the political and social order.  This, after all, is the explicitly stated charge against Jesus in the Gospel of Luke, along with preaching the non-payment of taxes to Rome.<br /><br />The third and final section provides an argument that I have always tried to impress upon my own students: we ended up with a Christianity that was not the faith envisioned by James the Just (Jesus' brother), or Peter, or any of the other of the Twelve ... we ended up with a Christianity created by Paul (or \\"revealed\\" to Paul, and to Paul alone).  Paul's clear antagonism (read Galatians) toward the \\"so-called pillars of the church\\" is palpable.  Aslan elucidates how Paul was being challenged by James and Peter (witness the Apostolic Conference in Jerusalem, ca. 50).  These are not authorial opinions of Aslan, but are things stated in the New Testament itself.  The author concludes with a brilliant exegesis on the Epistle of James (itself a sermon written down in the next generation) that vehemently denies that Paul's dismissal of the Law is acceptable.  Apparently, Jesus' brother - like Jesus - did not believe that one could simply ignore the Torah.<br /><br />If you are not a New Testament scholar who reads periodical literature, but want to gain an appreciation for the historical context of Jesus, this is definitely a book for you.  Kudos for Zealot!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This is an awesome movie! Even if you don't like singing in movies, you will like this film. It's got comedy, drama, and an amazing soundtrack! I recommend this to anyone!

B0064T6LV8|1.0|I don't like this game.  I find it difficult to use on my Kindle Fire, and find it frustrating to execute.
B00A7W29BE|3.0|Have used this for awhile and it will occasionally hang on my Samsung Galaxy 3. Have to kill the app to get it to work again (sometimes have to clear the cache also). Otherwise, nice how it organizes scans vs documents and allows joins and reorganization of pages once joined into a document. However, with the hanging app part, going to try another scanner app for a little bit as a compare.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I don't frequent YouTube often,  but when I want to see something interesting that someone told me about, it is good to have access.

B0064X7FVE|4.0|I have this on my Kindle Fire and it serves my purpose.  I find that the weather is relatively accurate.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|** I WAS GIVEN THIS BOOK FOR MY READING PLEASURE **  THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS  &#60;spoiler&#62; I'm not usually one for sad stories, or historical fiction. I'm even, not really one for family sagas. However, I enjoyed this book. At the beginning of the book I felt sorry for Greta, who is stuck with Wilhelm after he got her pregnant. She's Jewish and he's a German, but when they meet, a love of literature brings them together and he assures her that her nationality means nothing to him, even though it would to some others. After getting pregnant, Wilhelm promises to stick by her and they get married. Overtime, Greta continues to love him, but he doesn't love anything other than her looks. He used to love her intelligence, but not anymore. They bonded over books and literature and as soon as she got pregnant, that was taken from her. As was her family.  I find Wilhelm a total cad and a scoundrel. I hate his family and how they treat Greta and I feel sorry for Greta's family that they're losing her to such morons. To be honest, I was immediately quite worried about Karl's upbringing as well. I think what happens to Greta, concerning Wilhelm and Karl, is so sad but it's nice to see that she copes well with the vast change that's thrust upon her.  Normally, I don't like long breaks in the story, or long history/background lessons during a story, but here it really works. It's not a lecture or boring, it's intriguing and captivating. I studied Germany and the war in high school and again in an OU course, Humanities, and never knew most of what Fischer is telling me through this story. I never knew that large factions of Jewish people say it coming, that the writing was on the wall from as early as 1938. It's a real eye opener, and it really gives a strong sense of anticipation, foreboding and `luck' to the story.  I do love the characters in this book. I love Johan and although Johanna is a bit of a nightmare and a cow, you do get rare moments of light. When she does something, it's always for the `greater good' of her family, even if someone gets hurt or she has to feel remorse later. That's her payment. I also like that you get to see both sides of the argument, and how easily a person who had once had no problem with Jews could have their mind changed. Wilhelm showed this well, and Johanna is constantly battling conflicting feelings against the Jewish people. I know someone, a German, who was conscripted into the army back then, even though he, like Egon and Gunter, had no issues with the Jews, and how, like Gunter, it wasn't possible to say no without some ill effect.  I also like how Egon and Gunter are considered inferior and weak by their families but its their intellect that gains them pride and praise in the army. It's nice to see them getting some attention and approval after being practically abandoned and neglected by their families. I especially love little Wilma. She's so fragile and you just want to wrap her up and protect her from life. I think it's sweet that the steward was attracted to her, but even better was the just desserts he got from the girls. The rat incident was hilarious. I particularly enjoy Edith and Esther, they're so much fun.  I enjoy the characters that we meet in the camps, Freddie and even the old German women who are complete cows. They are real and honest and brutal sometimes, but believable. I especially loved Joschka. He was so sweet and lonely. You tend to forget that non Jewish people got caught up in the camps and that, besides hating Jews, the Nazis hated anyone who was different, whether that be religiously, politically, geographically or through sexual orientation. Edith, Esther and Joschka were both in danger for their sexuality, and it's heartbreaking to hear Joschka's story.  For me, the real luck of the Weissensteiners, was that Greta married Wilhelm. Although I hate him and he was a total ... I can't even find a word to describe him but he was cruel, and I'm glad no-one had to suffer him much, it was their marriage that saved the Weissensteiner family. Without that, they might never have had so much success. Wilhelm took Greta to the farm, leaving Jonah one less mouth to feed, and Johanna would allow `care' packages to go back from the farm to the Weissensteiners. Without Johanna, things would have been a lot worse for the family. Jonah could never have safely attended the Countess' ball, without knowing that he had Johanna's barn to sleep in so that he didn't get caught out after curfew. And without the Countess, nothing would have gone right, as she continued to keep their family name off the list of Jews. Although Egon was saved by his army officer, who recognised his talent, the rest of the family could still have been taken as Jews, with minimal damage or risk to exposing Egon. Only the Countess saved them.  And I think that's the real moral of the story, that the Weissensteiners, though Jewish, were saved by the people who loved them. Johanna, a German with conflicting views on Jews, and a Hungarian Countess who felt overly privileged and loved art. Without these friends, the family would surely have been found out at some point. I think the fact that they were sheltered and saved by these people is a true testament to how people are people, humans are humans and it doesn't matter about the colour of their skin, their accent, or their religious beliefs. Family are family. Friends are friends no matter what.  I really loved the Epilogue, and getting to find out how the story really ended. It's so sad that it took so many years for Greta and her family to find out the truth of what had happened to Alma, Jonah, the Countess and Egon. But that was how it really was. Some families still never know what happened to their relatives, even now, and it's gut wrenching. Needless to say that I cried at the end. I held out hope enough to stop myself until it was over. I find it completely perfect that Ernst found his family, even the lost ones, and got a conclusion to the story. We never found out what happened to Roswinth, who ran into the woods when the Soviets came, Gunter who was lost in the war, and Sarah, who was deported. Sadly, I think they died. But the sad truth is, that far too many people died, of any nationality and any proclivity. &#60;spoiler&#62;  I really look forward to reading more from this author.
B00BKBCF38|5.0|One of THE BEST RECORDS of 2013. These cats are amazing. The music is beautiful/hypnotic and truly brilliant. With the vocals together, the sound is unique and fantastic. Can't wait to see them live again. Give this record a try.

B001974DG0|5.0|This book entertained me so much that over the years I have read it aloud to two friends, so we could both enjoy it!  What a clever, emotional and truly loving tale.  If you ever had a special dog (or even if you are indifferent) you will find this story worth your time.  Moving and memorable.<br />When I got my last dog, years after first reading this book, I enjoyed a more enlightened relationship with such a special being.  Dogs ARE \\"LOVE\\"!

B00DP3IESY|3.0|This was slow, and very predictable.  Only worth watching at home, once.  Not as good as a normal Tom Cruise movie.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Interesting to read and realize how many changes were made when this book was written in play form and movie.  They took incredible license with the story.  It was nice to return to the written page and get the facts.

B004U8VX2M|2.0|My wife and remembered this series from its original run and were hoping to get our Downton Abbey fix while waiting for the new season. It's amazing how much things have changed in 40 years! The dialogue sounds like an old play, the characters are somewhat stereotypical and the sound is terrible. Glad we only purchased one episode rather than a whole season!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I enjoy this game and it is an interesting game and fun. I think I will keep this one.it is one my mom enjoys to.

B004XCUEU2|4.0|Really interesting DVD. Shows a lot of studio footage and work being done laying down tracks which is interesting to me. Profanity is to be expected amongst a rock band, but the F-word got old really fast with it's prevalent use.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love the whole book my favorite part is when Johanna said<br />that she would kill every on if that is what it took to get to the<br />Capitol there isn't really any thing I dislike.<br />The one part that is really emotional is when prim dies.<br />I recommend this book to 10 and above because it is<br />kind of emotional when prim dies. I was also sad when<br />Finnik died.<br /><br />I gave this book a 5 because I love every thing from story line to how it was presented
B00BN0BZVY|4.0|When they meet me, people tend to think that I'm amped up on several cups of coffee, which I'm not. It's just my high-energy personality, which is why I really enjoyed this story about Pat, a guy with some, ahem...issues. Unfortunately, I did this all wrong, by watching the movie first (which was excellent btw) and reading the book (which, in fairness, I had not known existed) second. And even though I loved the movie, I found the fact that it is significantly different than the book in several places a little unsettling. In spite of that, the book is both engaging and entertaining. It begins with Pat's mom having him discharged from \\"the bad place\\" early, hoping that he can recover while living at home from what seems to have been a mental breakdown that he had because of a certain incident that happened several years prior. To do so, he'll have to put up with his doting, underappreciated mother and uncommunicative, football-obsessed father. He's glad to be finished having sessions with the mental health facility's therapist (and move on to his new therapist) because, \\"he does not believe in silver linings, making it his business to preach apathy and negativity and pessimism unceasingly.\\" His obsessions including: exercising (mostly running, which I thought was cool), reading literature, and \\"practicing being kind rather than right,\\" all of which he does with his mind on the prize: ending \\"apart time\\" and getting back into his wife Nikki's good graces and life. Although his parents' problems dwarf his, they could use a few sessions with a therapist themselves. Add to the mix his relationship with his best friend's sister-in-law Tiffany, who has her own mental health problems stemming from the death of her law enforcement officer husband. Although I totally enjoyed reading about Pat's transformation from crazy guy to person able to generally interact appropriately with others, I'd have hated to have read it without knowing about the spoilers he provides about the following books: The Great Gatsby, A Farewell to Arms, The Scarlet Letter and The Bell Jar, if I hadn't, luckily, already read them (in fact, he and I are in complete agreement about A Farewell to Arms). Additionally, there's one contrived-feeling scene involving someone from his past (you'll know it when you read it). In summary, The Silver Linings Playbook is an entertaining story with great dialogue and characters, which I'd recommend to anyone who has already read the aforementioned classics. Also good: Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes, A Beautiful Mind by Sylvia Nasar and Girl, Interrupted by Susanna Kaysen.llowing books: The Great Gatsby, A Farewell to Arms, The Scarlet Letter and The Bell Jar, if I hadn't, luckily, already read them (in fact, he and I are in complete agreement about A Farewell to Arms).

B00ECU34ZM|2.0|The story builds slowly as we follow Tech 49 on his rounds and he battles the Scavs. After about 1 hour I got bored and started playing solitair with the movie as background noise. By this time I knew how it was going to end. The movie is really about Tom's ego as he found a venue that kept him on screen as the only actor for most of the movie.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|A great holiday read. Fast paced, entertaining and keeps you in suspense beautifully. Modern and scary in a 'what can actually happen' kind of way.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Does its job wonderfully. I can't stress how seriously large this heatsink is though. Had to remove the top side-fan because it obstructed the HSF by .5&#34; [i have a corsair 550D].<br /><br />I will be purchasing more of these HSFs for future builds.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I Love this game I would recommend it to anyone but they need to speed up the updates waited all summer for 8-0 beta but otherwise it's pretty freaking Amazing
B009KKLQVS|4.0|I read a few of the reviews and so far have only watched the opening song \\"Do It Again\\" and I thouroughly enjoyed.  Even my 6-yr old daughter loved it.  Though it would have been nice for some more special features etc, more songs, etc, I urge you all to sit back and enjoy this piece of history in blu-ray with dolby tru-hd sound.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Amazon MP3 plays wonderfully. But getting music already stored on our computer to this ap was not easy. After many searches with confusing instructions, we figured out how to do it through trial and error. Now that the music is on the phone via the ap, we're very happy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I picked this up because I read about the author in my alumni magazine.  I was completely sucked in and am now reading the whole series.  Can't wait for the final installment in a few days.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME IT IS SO FUN BUT I WISH WE HAD MORE OF A VARIETY OF PLACES thanks for your awesome games
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is soooo fun and is just like temple run.but with a minion twist. It is fun it has costumes you can put on and more
B00DP3IGJ6|2.0|It's just a bad movie. The way the story is told is odd, starts with Tom Cruise giving you a 2 minute summary of whey things are the way they are and then the story plods through an hour of crap before getting to the damn point. Then, from there, it's just bad. There are plenty of better sci-fi movies to choose from.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a very good book can't wait to read the next one I loved it ! Everyone should read it
B001EC2IXK|5.0|This is a great Paul Newman movie. If you haven't seen it you really need to. It's a classic. I'm so glad I got it. Honestly I was going to buy a micro SD card and I never buy things unless I use the Free shipping with purchases over $25. The SD card I bought was only $22 which was a steal (check that out on my other reviews) so I needed to tip the scale to get the free shipping. This movie came up in the blu-rays and I didn't even think twice. $8! Done.
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|Digital media is nice and it is instant.  Dexter is a interesting show to watch.  Video quality is good and amazon streaming works good .
B001R1G01O|4.0|I believe that comedians make great dramatic actors because they are the most connected to themselves in honesty. Gives them an advantage to play other characters with ease. Carrey's character is played with such honesty that it makes the part seem very real and human.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I have been trying to update it but it doesn't work on my iPod touch its bedder to have it on my iPod touch so I can play butt I love to ply on my kindle fire HD
B004SCN2F6|5.0|I have this on my phone but it's even better on my kindle fire.  Played it on a four hour airplane flight and hardly noticed the time.  Good use of three bucks.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Explains the root cause of the financial crisis from the perspectives of people who played different roles in it. Clarifies a complicated subject.
B00EAI9CSY|5.0|Well written, well acted, and the cinematography and tone are awesome.  This is an unusual, intelligent, and dark vampire film. Same director as Crying Game/Interview with a Vampire. You won't be disappointed.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Twisted love story of control and revenge.  Who is worse him or her?  Or do they just deserve each other?
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is my first Seiko watch.  It could not be a better fit for me. I recommend that you get one if you need a watch.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It's ok.  That's the best I can say.  It's nothing impressive.  It barely works.  It's pretty useless with iOS, unlike what it says.  So you can watch netflix, big deal, so can 10 other things I own.<br />Now the price is going up on it?  Don't waste you time, until they add more compatibility.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I am not great with techie stuff but this program is easy to use, syncs well with my pc, and is a great way for storage on the go with my kindle.
098555780X|5.0|New to braiding, needed to learn. Considered one of the best books to learn from. Had to have it! Gimme the paracord, it's time to braid!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Lots of Action and Special Effects, even some comedy at times.  Just a great all around movie for the whole Family!
0985557834|5.0|There are not enough words to describe how glad we are to have this book. We can't wait for Volume 3.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Awesome. I haven't watched them yet as I currently don't have my ps3 so I hope it works completely properly
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is fun to play! I do wish that there were more costume options that didn't require spending real money.
B00DU73T08|4.0|If you like Sci-Fi, or even just a suspenseful but not too suspenseful movie, it's great.  We love Twilight in this house, so we watched it just on that basis.  Very happy we did - it was very good.  Thought provoking, but not too serious.  We liked it.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Fun challenging game. Like the design choices and different features and strategy choices. Have it on my tablet and phone.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I really enjoy playing Jurassic Park Builder everything works great and it is fun watching your park grow. My problem is during the missions it wants you to sell back items and you only get half price when you do. If you don't sell when it tells you to you don't get more missions because it is waiting for you to finish up the active missions. Right now one mission wants me to sell back 5 buildings; it took me awhile to save up enough coins just to buy them in the first place. The last thing that I don't like is it takes so many coins to decode a fossil ( an I mean a lot of them) and then you have to use more coins or money to buy it; i wouldn't mind if it were one or the other that costs a lot to do, but not both.  I don't think you can really build a nice park without buying money/coins.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I love this album! It has to be one of my favorites this year, I can't stop listening to it.
B000V658EQ|5.0|Every song on this album is incredible!<br />Special mention to the title track and &#34;Inner City Blues&#34; which I have had on repeat for the last several days.<br />If you like R&B you should have bough this two days ago.
B00DF0POXA|1.0|I accidentally downloaded this album from my touchscreen phone after downloading another song.  I am NOT a fan of Kanye, I should've got my money back.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I am fond of creating books indesign saw, pays maker, and now would like to make one for kindle, I like this book bareback
8866137960|5.0|Very useful as a med student rounding in the hospital, super compact and very cool looking too, specially when you don't want to be taking out your phone every minute.
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|Real fun and easy to play. The characters are cute I do like the challenge of the game really keeps me in tune.
0517548232|5.0|I have bought about 15 copies of this book over the years and I have given them all away to friends.  It is a superbly written book with no economic jargon, just common sense.  Frankly, this should be read by all high school students.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I really like this app it serves it's purpose GREAT and is very accurate.  There is one small problem, I did not care for the update. But I will get use to it and in return it still serves it's purpose GREAT.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|This show is one of the best shows I have seen in a LONG time! It keeps getting better and better.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|The games i choose for fun are all played with the grandchildren.<br />it keeps them guessing and they never get bored... it is fun for the whole family!!!
B003L77FYS|5.0|This show is one of the best shows I have seen in a LONG time! It keeps getting better and better.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I only gave this book at 3 star. I liked the book, however I prefered the first two books in the series. I for some reason din not expect a fourth book.
B0053O89KG|5.0|This show is one of the best shows I have seen in a LONG time! It keeps getting better and better.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I really liked this book. I liked the twist and I really liked the characters. If you liked Hopeless then you will like this book too. They are nothing a like both of the books just have the right feel about them.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This show is one of the best shows I have seen in a LONG time! It keeps getting better and better.
B0015AARJI|5.0|You've played Resistance, Warhawk, Heavenly Sword, and Uncharted but something doesn't feel the same. Well worry no more your fears can now be relieved. Rumble is back to bring many of the PS3 best games to life. I used to play games a lot, and now I'm down to -maybe- 2 hours per sitting, but 4-5 hours seems a bit long to me, so it needing to recharge after that much time seems reasonable. It is bluetooth, syncs instantly, and works with all games. Not all games will be dualshock vibration compatible, but the controller works with all games on the PS3.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It's a decent little timesink! It's just that obnoxiously and devilishly good. Think about it like this... Ponies meets Farmville for children.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome not like those other games like it but my only issue is how do you get skins please tell me
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I love how easy it is to play, a favorite  game from childhood!  I would recommend this game for ALL ages!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This is a great novel, much different from the film, but more intricate and detailed, with a global overview of the Zombie war.
B00AYB0YFQ|5.0|Easily the best scary movie of the 5. Followed by 2 and 3...you see where I am going with this.
B00C5WR6JE|4.0|Bill Frisell continues to morph and re-invent.  California, Big Sur.  Certainly not quite Nashville or Good Dog Happy Man, but just as interesting.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I have happily been using The Weather Channel app on my Kindle since I first got it. The recent update has ruined what was once a good thing. I wonder if the folks at TWC have ever heard the saying: &quot;If it's not broken - don't fix it!?&quot; Apparently they haven't because they have ruined what used to be an easily read and very helpful tool. They should have given people the option to update if they chose to instead of forcing us to deal with this &quot;new&quot; confusing &amp; hard to navigate updated mess that lost many of the once easy to navigate options &amp; features in the process. Due to the fact that I hate the updated version and now it doesn't even load most of the time and tends to freeze my Kindle when it does load &amp; I try to load the map (which btw is not half as good as the former version &amp; is a pain to use even when it does work) I am uninstalling this debacle of a weather app and will be using Accuweather unless TWC makes it possible to revert to the previous version of their app!!
1594203334|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book and I've recommended it to several people.<br /><br />Some things to note:  of course not all French parents are perfect and not all American parents are overly indulgent, hovering disasters.  But this is not a research paper so putting a fine point on it is not the purpose.  Also, anyone with young children -- or who has friends with young children -- in the current parenting climate in the US must have noticed that it borders on deranged in some circles.<br /><br />For those considering reading the book who may be put off by the negative reviews:  Bringing up Bebe does not discourage breastfeeding (the author herself breastfeeds); it does not suggest that parents let infants cry for hours or starve all night; it does not advocate ignoring your child in parks or abandoning him in daycare; and it is not criticizing YOUR personal style of parenting.<br /><br />It does offer some very useful suggestions for helping babies sleep through the night, backed by research, and some excellent ideas for getting children to eat new foods.  It also describes teaching children independence and patience.  Best of all, I enjoyed the reminder that it's ok to be a mother AND a human being with interests beyond my child.<br /><br />As I read the book, I gave my 5-year-old the recipe for the yogurt cake and she made it all by herself; it was a lovely experience for her.  It hadn't occurred to me that she could do this at her age.  See, we can all learn from others!
B000PC6A3E|5.0|This is a great movie! Also, the disc and packaging itself were in Very good condition! Thank you very much!
B0090SI4LU|4.0|I had never heard of this movie until I rented it. I must say this movie was pretty good. While it had that \\"TV mini series\\" feel to it, it still worked. I didn't recognize Saoirse Ronan at first because she has grown up a bit. But she is one of my favorite actresses and she doesn't disappoint here. She plays \\"the alien\\" to perfection. Perhaps the world becomes a \\"better place\\" with the aliens running it, but I don't know why a bunch of \\"peaceful souls\\" would not see taking over people's bodies as the ultimate act of aggression. And the blond alien is NOT a \\"peaceful soul\\". I guess just another case of the conquerors lying to those they conquer and to themselves.<br /><br />The music in this film is beautiful and the second half of the movie has some real emotional roller coasters. I would call this a \\"soft\\" Sci-Fi movie. It is more of a drama with a Sci-Fi backdrop. I plan on buying this film.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Got this as a free app of the day I'm enjoying the game it defently keeps my attention while playing the game specialy when board
1449305172|5.0|This book is a great explanation on how to plan Lean from the business level. As a developer, I've seen Lean and Agile practiced at the technical level. It's refreshing to see a book dedicated to how to execute on the business level without diving into software development terms (which a lot of Agile books jump into quickly).<br /><br />I liked how the book stresses on \\"minimum viable product\\" (MVP) and \\"unique value proposition\\" (UVP) throughout the chapters. It keeps focus on evaluating business values of an idea being implemented, including a primer on how to collect feedback from your potential audience without influencing an outcome.<br /><br />In all, for a short book (just like the idea of Lean), the content does a great job on conveying the methodology to creating value.
1455523550|4.0|You never let me down Nicholas Sparks, could not put it down, I became emotionally invested in the characters, and did not want the story to end.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This improves on the first in every way. Able to zoom, time limit, screen fits phones for once.  Also game adds new game play such as opening cabinets and jigsaw puzzles.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Good, but confusing due to the storyline bouncing back and forth between the past and present. Hard to get into the book at first.
0486274268|4.0|My son and i had fun drawing animals out of this book. My son is eight so that says a lot about a this book. It reminds me of the old style disney movies when i was a kid. Its clear and easy to understand. I still use it for reference. I needed to draw a horse and used this book the other day to draw one.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|If you believe in nothing, or your not sure what to believe this is a great book. If you already have a solidly developed internal faith/moral compass this book won't be much more than a good story.<br />But if you have a friend that needs a lift, and they don't have any particular religious flavor, this is a great book to help guide them.
B000058CBN|4.0|&#34;Wait Until Dark&#34; has been a favorite movie to me for decades. I think my memories of the movie were better than the movie itself or maybe I am a bit let down because I knew the ending and the &#34;surprise&#34; was gone. If you have never seen this movie, you will be on the edge of your seat with anticipation the entire last half of the movie. In todays world, this film runs a bit too slow, but when it was new this film was a cutting edge cinema thriller.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This was a great movie. My only wish was that it was a little longer. It was well thought out and executed though. Like I said, I wanted more. Hopefully, there will be an Oblivion 2 or prequel. Tom Cruise is on his way back up. The graphics and special effects were also very well done. I would recommend to all Sci-Fi fans.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|So funny and a great classic from when I was a kid!  My kids and I watch this OVER and OVER!!!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book and think it's a real eye opener for this  who wish time would fly by or slow down or focus too much around the subject. It's an easy read  an  keeps the reader interested and intrigued. Amazing book!
0525478817|3.0|I was excited to read this book because of all of the excellent reviews it was getting. I can't say that I agree with them though. While I thought this book was well-written, I am not sure the story pulled me in as it did others. This story is about two teens struggling with Cancer. They befriend each other and of course there isn't a happy ending. It is a very emotional book but there is just something about it that did not tug at me as I had hoped. Overall it was extremely depressing. I felt terrible for both sets of parents and of course the teens stricken with this horrible disease. I don't mind reading about intense or upsetting subject matter if I can somewhat relate to the characters or feel some type of emotional connection but unfortunately I just didn't feel that with this book. All I felt was sad.
B001D0BLTA|5.0|What a classic John Hughes movie! It has the poor girl from the wrong side of the tracks; the handsome rich kid who falls for her; and the one friend who wants the girl but cannot have her. The wowes of high school make you really root for the girl and her daily struggles to not only be invisible to the bullies, but to be seen with the popular handsome boy. I can see this movie a million times!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was my first read of erotic romance..Wow...loved the book and loved Christian Grey's character. The author made he soooooo sexy. Loved his knowledge of women. Great Read
B00B8ESWAM|1.0|With this cast I was expecting a great movie. Could not even sit through the whole thing - BORING. Characters were not believable. Some nice filming but that is the only good thing I can say about this movie.  Watched the rest of it a week later thinking maybe it would get better - NOPE - only got worse.  A REAL CLUNKER.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was great. Nothing I didn't like about it. Although am not into pain/sex this book almost made it sound worth trying. Whew, sex scenes were so hot hot hot...Read This book. Can't wait for movie...

B009CG3M1C|5.0|We had a great time watching Battleship.  It is exciting, funny, romantic, and everything that is great about a great movie.
B00009NHC5|5.0|A Favorite movie. This is a plot you can get lost in and have to see until the end.  A &#34;must have&#34; for any movie library!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series hits a home run!  Astonishingly well written, directed and acted. Intriguing stories involving every member of the ruling family and serving class. Set against real-life world happenings and changes... it's amazingly engaging. Can't wait for upcoming seasons.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome. ive played it before on my friends Ipod and Ipad. this game rocks. get it now I insist.  NOW!! :)

B004JN1D2I|5.0|I can't seem to put it down!  My husband is starting to wonder what I REALLY have on my Kindle!
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|it took me a while to figure it out as to how the whole thing works but once I got it it became a timing issue to try to finish everything to get the big finish.  It is alot of fun. It gets stuck sometimes when trying to figure out a puzzle. Put I still really like this game
1623360277|5.0|As a long time vegan I recently had the bad idea to try adding cheese back in my diet and what a surprise, I put on weight and felt like junk.  So this book was just the reminder I needed to knock it off.  Just a couple days into it but will post again on results.
B007QUUJMG|5.0|An &#34;honest&#34; portrait of a teenage boy with mental health problems... I can't put the book down. You can relate so much to the characters in the story.

B000YABYLA|4.0|if I could have watched it, I would have liked it much better. I have seen it many times so I thought I would buy it, it don't work
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|My favorite part about this game was the variety of planes. My favorite out of all of them Is the F-100D super sabre. This is a really fun game that everyone should experience for themselves.
B000CNESU8|5.0|A look into the world of television..it's selfish..it's cruel...it's true...fantastic film...a film well before its time...its all about TRPs...it was true then..its true today...no film buff should miss this film...films like 'NETWORK\\"are not made anymore...Another Gem from Sidney Lumet.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I couldn't put down, a page turner The characters come alive and the relationships though not openly discussed were surprising to me. Beauyifly written.
1781162646|5.0|I have been reading his books for almost 40 years and loved most of them.  A few years back he seemed to take a turn down a wrong road, but came flying back with 11/22/63 and now Joyland.  These are books I remember long after I have read them and read them again through the years.  Listened to Joyland on audio on my way to and from work this last week and had the most enjoyable ride in years.  A must read for true Stephen King fans.  Even if you are not a fan, pick it up and read -<br />you won't regret it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I platy almost every day. I am a huge fun of this game, The googd thing IT is FREE !!
B00CKR63F2|5.0|Beyond Bridalveil Fall is a beautifully written well paced story filled with all the elements readers crave in a book. I was hooked immediately, turning the pages faster and faster as dove in. The author takes you on an adventure right along side her colorful cast of characters in the enchanted world of shape shifters, fairies, and plenty of magic. There were moments in the story that I actually felt like I was standing right alongside Oria, fighting against the evil that threatened to destroy her. When I got to the end, all I wanted was more! I honestly can't wait to see what happens next.<br /><br />This book is truly a must read! I really love books that can be enjoyed by readers of all ages. It's engaging for adults and I'm quite certain younger audiences will devour it. Amazing story written by an amazing author!
1623420148|5.0|This book is like no other romance novel i have ever read. The whole book is from the male POV and he is talking directly to u, the reader and he is funny as hell! And very believable to how most men behave. I couldn't put it down and will be reading again in the future.
140006922X|5.0|As an older man, who has been reading books on the Historical Jesus all his life, I can<br />say that I find this book authoritative, very well thought out and clearly written.  Aslan<br />consistently points out that he is not writing about the Religious Figure of Jesus but<br />rather deducing the likeliest, actual reality of the man and his times.  Even better though<br />Aslan does an excellent job of describing the Jewish experience that sets the stage for<br />Jesus and his ministry, and beyond that explores the transition/evolution from the<br />Historical Jesus into something more familiar to the average Christian today.  If you want<br />to reinforce longheld beliefs about Christ's Divinity etc, you probably want to look elsewhere.<br />If you want to get a solid picture of what was happening then and how the Christianity of<br />today was born, look no further.  In my opinion, this is an excellent place to start...and for<br />more detailed information, Aslan's copious notes in the back of the book will satisfy any hunger<br />for more.

B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I loved the graphics and sound effects. I worked on it a little at a time just before going to bed with the lights out for effect. I really did have fun with this game. The ending could be a bit more exciting, but for 2 bucks it is well worth it. Look forward To the next game.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Its really fun in the beginning because the first couple are easy then you get the harder ones and cant figure it out. I also wish they would give you more coins for the ones you get right.
034580709X|5.0|This is the first Jo Nesbo book I have read.  I loved it.  The characters were interesting and fully rounded.  I am looking forward to reading this entire series.
B00BPA2PBG|2.0|I was eager to try out Sony's \\"Mastered in 4K\\" series of blu-ray releases, having been a big fan of their \\"SuperBit\\" DVDs.  I must admit to being surprised at the low picture quality of Ghostbusters in 4K.  The original grain structure of this movie was, thankfully, left intact.  However, the processing of that grain was so poorly handled that it comes across looking more like video noise than film grain.  This is most evident in high-color areas (check out the spines of the books on the library shelves near the beginning of the movie).  Unfortunately, they chose to pump up the chroma levels throughout Ghostbusters, too, which also serves to exacerbate the grain noise.  Overall, a disappointment in regard to picture quality, and definitely not what I expected.  Videophiles beware.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I just got it out of the box and the control Works great!! Im highly satisfied with this purchase highly recomended!!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Loved it! Loved it! Loved it!  Now I'm looking forward to watching it on Netflix.
B0043RSE2M|5.0|Need I say more, love , love , love this show. The 3 D was ok, not super outstanding, however the show is awesome. Loved the whole movie. Need more like this.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a great series.  i had heard many good reviews from friends so i decided to watch this and catch up.  My only complaint is that they don't film it fast enough.
B00821PCJS|2.0|My son told me to watch this.  To me just same old aliens trying to kill off earthlings plus i didnt care for the actors. Same old stuff
B009AJDET6|4.0|I have been a casual fan of Chicago since the late 60's. I owned Chicago II when it came out and purchased the Greatest Hits collection in CD when it was released.  This 10-CD collection of Chicago Studio albums seemed like a relatively inexpensive way to explore deeper cuts by Chicago - to see if there is more to them than just the singles we have all heard.  I must say, this has been a real surprise.  There is a surprising consistency between albums - many of these tracks I have never heard before & they are very good.  One other nice benefit of this box - Rhino included the remastered albums with bonus tracks; this has not been the case with most of the Classic Album collections.  As with many of the new Classic Album collections - record labels have skipped on the booklets and liner notes.  Frankly, I'm OK with that, you are getting 10 albums [many of which are double albums] for under $35.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love Playing This Game It's So Fun And Great For All Ages Highly Recommend This Games To Anyone Boys Or Girls.<br />Girls !
0143038583|5.0|Interesting book about parts of the food industry. I think that if more people knew more about where their food comes from and what is is done to it before we eat it, people would make very, very different eating decisions.
B001I9B9I4|5.0|Story line is easy to follow and plight of all first children in the White House is relevant to any point in history and any family that has been in that position.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|Of course this is a children's book but I enjoyed it.  Easy to read and an interesting premise.  Your always wondering what strange thing will happen next.
B003477DVK|5.0|Simply love this movie. A must see family movie of a dog and timid little boy. A warm and heart felt story.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|With the Netflix credit, this device is extremely affordable. As soon as more applications begin to follow suit, I'm sure it will be great.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|The power play is what gets me. It's the same mentality that was behind prohibition, the drug war. Where is the freedom our fathers fought for and defended? Laws should protect each citizen from encroachment by one or more citizens. In so doing, enable each one of us to pursue our personal happiness.
0553386794|5.0|The book was in great condition. I've had no problems with it. Very happy with this purchase. Thank you. : )
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|Very fun. I loved the notebook and map. The hint sheet was neat for when my 6 year old<br />played it on her own. Overall very entertaining.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|help to keep your mind sharp, and helps you to look at things differently than you normally would... great puzzles and fun way to keep entertained and learning at the same time.
B00BX8PG4S|5.0|It's Great in everyway.  One of the best movies I have ever seen; sober and intense as hell. Riveting performance by Ed Harris, David Duchovny.  Not to sell out the other actors, they were exceptional also.  The director (I would equate him to the master, Alfred Hitchcock) HAD to have a heavy hand in this.  Had no earthly idea David Duchovny could act like this!!  Duchovny was, in his other movies, restrained as an actor.  Those other roles were NOT for him (and I never even liked him much in the x-files); this is simply an explosion of his full acting abilities (and I know he knows it).  Of course, Ed Harris has always been great, the epileptic seizure scene was masterfully handled.<br /><br />Everything worked well, like a well oiled machine, like I said, the director must be exceptional.  Also, check out the selection of well seasoned actors, you could have put any one of them in a lead role by themselves. I wish I could see more of these actors in other movies. They are like the actors decades ago, who actually had talent.  Not one was bad actor and not one scene boring or uninteresting.
0375869026|4.0|I love this book. It is very inspiring. One of the best books I have ever read! I love it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game. It is fun for all ages. I can play this game all day long and never get bored.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|All of the Harry Hole series refer to his specialty of finding serial killers, based on his famous first case in Australia. Although this series does not have to be read in order, this is the first sequentially, though only recently translated. Here we discover many of Harry's demons, his history with alcohol, his lost loves and the circumstances surrounding their loss. So happy finally to have the full picture!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Great writing with a great story.  Instead of a story being told to you, it feels more like you are living it with the characters.
B00CW665VI|5.0|WOW this book was fabulous.  I cannot wait for this new authors next book.  Was very different to the normal romance and extremely funny and enjoyable
B005GIS1SY|5.0|I never saw this movie in the theaters.  I wish I would have.  This movie is so cute and loveable.  My kids love it.  I think it will have to be one that we buy.  A must see!
B006LSZECO|1.0|It WAS an intriguing &#34;read&#34;, even through the slow moving, boring 1st third.  WAY too much time spent there.  The plot then became interesting because it moved in an unpredictable, yet stimulating, direction -- right up 'til the ending.  The ending STUNK!!  That could never happen that way.  If you didn't have an ending well thought out (decided), or just wanted your readers to be left disappointed, then you succeeded!  The ending just wasn't believable and made me feel that I wasted my time reading the whole book.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  I didn't expect much and it surprised the heck out if me.  I was shocked that an 11 year old girl would say and do some of the things she was required to do.  The movie is action packed and sets up for a sequel.  I will most likely go see the sequel as well.  It's basically an action movie with a love story intertwined in it and some twists that may surprise or shock you.  It's worth seeing, but not a block buster.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|I was interested in seeing how successful the book and the narrative, available from Audible, sync'd so before spending a fortune on new best-sellers I test drove an old classic. I enjoyed the book and the sync worked amazingly well!!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|i've always loved the Alien universe, and to have it all in HD, it's wonderful, i loved every bit of this pack :)
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The only thing I'm missing is a diagram of the various families and how they tie back to the principal characters.  It seems like everytime I expect something to happen with a charater, I'm surprised by what actually happens to them.  I have not seen the tv show but I'm looking forward to watching at some point to see how well it holds up to the book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Certainly not a young teen only book. Very entertaining and lots of suspense. I liked the ending in the third book.
B00CAJMGDI|4.0|I'm listening to the music now and throughly enjoy the violin and instrumentals in the background.  Makes me want to take up the violin again (last time was in 6th grade).
193700788X|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Mrs. Harris and have read all of her books outside of this series as well as this one. I've eagerly waited for each book to come out and snapped it up as soon as I could. That said, I've been disappointed with the last two books. This one more than the previous. It felt inconsistent, almost like someone was rushing her through the writing and the care that she normally takes just wasn't there. I felt like someone had just told me half a story in very rich detail, paused, then ended it with \\"so you know...that's it, the end...or whatever\\" and kind of left me hanging, but not in a good suspenseful way. Clearly she's not feeling this storyline anymore, so I'm glad it's over, but I would have preferred it to end three books ago when she still had it in her.
B0010YPTGU|5.0|Worth every penny! This was an excellent concert outdoors in Bocelli's Teatro de Silencio in Italy. Under a beautful sunset sky with an incredible vista and great performances like Lang Lang...
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book contains a story that is totally enjoyable for the reader.  It was significantly more enjoyable than the movie, although the movie did have some good acting.  The story in the movie was changed to apparently make it more palatable to general audiences.  I would have preferred that they had stuck to the original story line.  And you don't have to be a Philadelphia Eagles fan to enjoy it.  I proved that.
B006WAIV6M|5.0|I loved it so much I could not put it down until i finished it.  It was sooooo interesting.  I have always been intrigued about the human mind and how we form habits and it was an amazing read!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|There really isn't much of a story.  It's just a little bit of padding between an endless amount of porn.  I'm no prude, but after a while, you'll just need a cigarette (even if you're not a smoker).
B003MXAQJW|5.0|one of my favorite movies of all times -if there was every a more dysfunctional family-hilarious,my favorite actors too,best movie,comedy of all times
B005XZHQKY|5.0|I have a 3D ready tv and watched this collection and it was totally awesome it looks like your really there in the water and you learn about so many different types of sharks and other sea animals just one amazing collection

B00B769XB8|5.0|Oh wow this movie was great i love the uncut version it showed a lot more than when i saw it in the movies if you like horror movies this is a good one
B000CNFC76|5.0|This is the best movie ever!  You can enjoy this one with the entire family and will watch it over and over again.  Good story line.<br />It will become a family favorite.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Lots of fun. Can't get enough. Don't use the slots as much as I could. Haven't found how to add friends and exchange items yet,but what a fun game
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very good app that works the brain a good exercise for making you think. Wish they had more levels to play
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|Honestly, I can't remember if I completely finished this book, but I can say that the description of  the plot was not actually what the book was about.  The timeline was difficult to follow, character development was poor.
B003Z0BWRM|4.0|Really struggled to get into this book, by halfway I was hooked and by the end sad that it was finished. i will be reading more of this series in the future
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I kept laughing out loud. It got to be embarrassing. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever enjoyed laughing.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Good game to pass time for kids adults alike. Also, this game improves hand eye coodnation. It is an all around great game.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I use this a couple times a day.  Very interesting material on most any subject you are interested in.  I also forward some on the pages.
B0053TMP24|5.0|LOL LOVE LOVE LOVED IT LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVVVVVVVED IT I HEART IT SO MUCH  JKWOOHOO  JKWOOHOO  AWSOME INSPIRING EPIC GO PERCY JACKSON
B00E5BQ9SW|1.0|STOP MAKING THESE STUPID 3000 COPIES LIMITED EDITION B*LL S***. MANY WOULD LIKE TO PURCHASE SOME OF THESE FILMS! BUT AT THE PRICES THAT THESE FILMS DEMAND BECAUSE PEOPLE SNATCH THEM UP AND SELL THEM OVERLY PRICED ON THE SECONDARY MARKET. COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS!
B009WUBERW|2.0|The definition is;designed to be used only once and then abandoned or destroyed.That says it all for me.I like all the actors,but this movie was bad.Thank gosh it was free on amazon prime.
B00628RVV0|4.0|A reminder of the tragedy of Hitler's Germany and the goodness of heart that will always overcome the evil of the world.
0897502027|5.0|I am a Martial Artist. I purchased the original hardback edition when it was first published many years ago, but it was stolen. I have been searching for this book for years now and feel my collection of Bruce Lee is complete.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is great for challenging your friends or even just when you are bored and looking for something to do. I also,enjoy the large selections of characters and skateboards you are able to choose from so that you can surf the subways in style. This awesome app is free and fast-paced. You are sure to  become<br />addicted to subway surfers just  as I did!
B007SGM084|5.0|I cant put into words how much I loved this series. It was truely a wonderful, sexual, alluring masterpiece of a love story. Christian and Ana have a magical bond that people (men & women) honestly wished they actually had. I have read other series that suppose to be like Fifty Shades but nothing even comes close to how good this series is. I can't even put into words how much I loved it. I have read it about four times and each time I cry, I laugh, and love the book all over again. Thank you E.L. James you really got to me with these characters; you really have no idea how much.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|i can't believe this app was free.  Losts of levels and you can reach them all (so far anyways) without paying a cent.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It made me cry and laugh. It was such a good book and movie.I'm so glad I read it. Thanks
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Somewhat unbelievable, but that's part of the books charm.  Really easy read if you need to kill time on a long trip.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Wish they could make a movie out of this one instead of book #9. It was a really good  read.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Great movie. Soon to be a classic for sure... although it's a little slow it's very well written and has a great plot. I just wish the ending had a few more minutes (-:
B00AKFG15S|3.0|Lost the point in the second chapter. And again ended in a mystery just so I read the next book
B002W1UEW4|1.0|Even if I was eight years old, I would probably think it was stupid. I really wanted to watch something mindless, but this movie is way beyond mindless. Don't even know where to start...Don't waste your time.
1593977476|5.0|I love this series and love to listen to them while driving.  I have all of this series on CD and have gone through them more than once.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting a fun and fast moving book.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Well written with an interesting style and good pace.  Lots of interesting ethical questions come up and keep you thinking. Well worth reading and a good book club selection.
B005LAII80|5.0|This is the first blu-ray 3D movie I auditioned on a new 3D flatscreen and holy crap, it is amazing. Especially the drug and falling scenes, but the 3D really adds to the movie's impression quite a bit. Also a fantastic action movie in itself, if a little implausible. Note, quite a bit of violence here, not for the squeamish.
0761174192|5.0|I have been ordering this calendar for almost 10 years.  I like cats and the stand up calendar In our kitchen  keeps us up to date first thing every day.  great Calendar.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|This is my kind of movie:  action & suspense.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes the action<br />genre.
B0047SF41G|5.0|The saga continues. I've collected all of the &#34;Predator&#34; movies and this one wasn't bad. The story gets better and better.
B001P5M7QE|5.0|It's so dumb it is hilarious!  We watch this and then quote it all the time!  You want something?  It will cost you &#34;one shrubbery&#34;!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I want to move into the Institute and live with these people.  Where do I sign up?  So sly, yet so sweet.  Tension and thrills.  I have read the series and I am looking forward to the movie.  I had to reread it to get myself up to speed.
B007F1SGM6|1.0|I hadn't seen this movie before I had purchased it.  This is a BORING movie.  Wish I had saved my money!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|hopefully there will be an update to allow small apps without a need for a pc/smart phone other than to be a remote.<br /><br />Does what it says, but seems like it should be able to do more. Be nice to add support for the whole PC instead of just chrome, that way you can stream your gaming or other apps.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|We listen to this all the time.  My kids know all the words, and I love that they love it!
B001974DG0|5.0|I can't say enough how much I loved this book.  I love that Mr. Koontz is a dog person.  He hits a homerun for me with this one.
B005ZMUZDU|5.0|This is a classic!  I wanted to make sure I had a digital copy of this one.  It's great to have when you are traveling or anytime.  We love this movie!
0156027321|5.0|Although Ang Lee's movie has breath-taking cinematography, the book has the better story.  The book is recommended for those who have a philosophical focus in looking at life's big question.  Why am I here?  The journey of Pi through his confrontation with the overwhelming power of the natural world in relation to the insignificance of a tiny human who struggles to survive in it, is a journey we all take.  Each reader will, if they take the time to ponder the question, come up with their own interpretation of that quest.  But, the ultimate answer for Pi is love and hope.  If one can find within oneself, that part which refuses to give in to the demons  of &#34;Despair&#34; and &#34;Fear,&#34; we will find our understanding of God.  All lessons matter if we use the experience to understand ourselves and others (including other life forms) in a deeper, more meaningful way.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Don't play this game if you need to be quiet.  I scream every time I flip over and it can be frustrating...just when you think you have it!!!  You flip!!!  Really a fun game.
0385342071|5.0|could not stop untill i fineshed it and got sunburned:-), fun as most of her books, nice plot - much different from the &#34;holics&#34; series
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Interesting story but a little slow for my taste. It has a nice ending and the characters were pretty interesting.
0449002632|3.0|unfortunately i picked up the paper back version which is very difficult to read, small print,go for the hard book
B0002Y69NQ|5.0|Keanu Reeves is just so aptly-cast in these movies.  He is fantastic, as is the supporting cast.  The bust of him with all the movies and bonus extras is a great show-piece to have in your media collection.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book at times got confusing but was great thriller! I kept wondering who she was gonna choose hoping for Peeta. The ending made me sad but I enjoyed this book very much!!! (P.s. You never really are able to tell what comes next)
B002RVEIAI|4.0|Part of this movie was filmed in Albuquerque, where I live, so I was anxious to see it.  It's not quite as good as the other Terminator movies - not enough Schwarzenegger (even though he is naked and just as buff as ever!) - but it does stand up on its own.  Recommended.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an awesome game I first found for the computer and this almost good the only problem I have had no caves that's sort of the fun of it on the computer I'm glad you can just play with your friends also realms is not working I used to be able to play with my friends and realms kinda ruined for me I wish it worked.
B0000JCFPE|4.0|This movie is well-acted and entertaining.  Some scenes are rather disturbing and violent, but it keeps you on your toes.  Definitely for the 18-and-older crowd.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Very good love story I will have to read more of the series I will have to tell everyone how good they are
B000031EGV|4.0|This is a very entertaining movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Very good special effects.  Robin Williams is always a treasure to watch.
0064471837|5.0|I found Sabriel in a bookstore when I was 14 and have read it many times since. It is hard not get lost within the world of the Old Kingdom and the Abhorsen's on going fight for life against the dead that keep trying to come back. Sabriel finds out that something is wrong with her dad in a very not so ordinary way and so her adventure begins over the wall into the Old Kingdom, where charter magic is a rule of law lived by many and the dead can come back to bother the living. She takes up the role of her father the Abhorsen. This one of the greatest books I have read and hope that you read it to so you can enjoy it just as much I have over the years! :)
B0014I4KIK|5.0|I LOVE this CD!  Rockferry, Mercy and Distant Dreamer are my three favorites, but all the songs are great.  You will really enjoy it.
B0031QUTBA|5.0|They were awesome. I was a little nervous because of the price as compared to other items similar, but it delivered all 10 complete seasons of Friends
B004HWYTP4|3.0|The movie was good but not the best movie. My mom and i watched this Friday afternoon because we saw thee second one on Saturday.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is easily one of the most beautiful and powerful works of literature your eyes will ever transmit o your brain for processing and comprehension. The Fault In Our Stars is a blinding story of star-crossed love that takes the preconceived notions of young adult novels, and kicks them in the face. It goes on to completely seduce you, amaze you, and (once you know that you are totally in love with the sudden love story of the main characters) smash your heart into innumerable pieces that you know you will never truly be able to put back together. It simply has no choice but to destroy you emotionally in the best way possible. It takes a moment to fall in love with this book, a night to finish it, and several lifetimes to recover from the beauty and tragedy. You simply have to read it,and finish until the bitter end, for it will enlighten you, and show the true depth of teenagers, the terminal cases, and those who are left behind when the grenade finally blows.
B008JFURII|3.0|The movie was good. If u saw red 1 then you will understand this but if you haven't you will still understand the movie. The cast were good.
1250029465|5.0|We, too, had an orange tabby that appears to have been the doppelganger of Bob.  He found us one rainy evening and refused to go home the next day, so he became part of our family.  Like Bob, he loved people, riding in cars, and exhibited very non-cat-like and wonderful personality traits. And he was as smart as a whip!  We had him for 15 years until he passed from complications of diabetes two years ago (he never fussed when we gave him his daily insulation injections the last four years of his life).  He was an amazing cat and my buddy, and hardly a day doesn't go by when I don't think of him...  Reading James book was hard at times due to my constantly thinking of our Nettie, but I loved every word of it and can truly appreciate the bond and mutual spirit between James and Bob!  What a wonderful and uplifting read!
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Great movie!  Best Bond Film in years!  The sound quality wasn't all that great streaming through my Roku but it is fine on the computer so yay!
B000FCKC4C|3.0|It seemed to be written to encourage young adults to follow their dreams.  In a different culture it maybe would have had more meaning to adults.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book was very well written, but i did not like it as much as the first two books. Too much sadness
B009GEYX5E|2.0|The film seemed to be the right type. It fit and the first cover sheet came out like the original film but when taking the pictures 3 of the eight photos turned out all black.  I am pretty sure it was the not the camera because the pictures that did come out fine were of the same type that were black. There is no other film out there for the old cameras so I guess next time I want to spend so much for eight photos I will have to take another chance on this film.
B007XAYKX8|5.0|I would love to see more of this type of documentaries available on Amazon prime.  This documentary shows some behind the scenes technical details and interviews from the riders is great.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|Nothing to deep, sinister or political. Just an honest enjoyable movie. If you can't enjoy a movie like this, then give up, all is lost.
B009WUBERW|3.0|I would have given it 2 stars, but it is what it is.  I'm for more realistic action and adventure.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great book, but you've got to read &#34;The Fall of Giants&#34; first. I like good historical novels where I can learn a little history and get a good story on the way.  This is one of those books.
B0029EDMEG|4.0|Tom plays a layed back chief but carries a big stick.  Through his toughness, he is kind, fair and gentle when needed.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|Love the small size and ease of operation. We have the scale and the cuff as well. All are very good.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use this app a lot. Whenever I can't sleep I put on all of the sounds for rain, thunderstorms, etc, and I fall right to sleep. I still can't believe I got it for free, especially because now that I have it - I would've paid anything for it!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is an awesome zombie series. Drama, jealousy, love, survivalism included. Great make-up effects. These zombies really creep you out! It will be a cult series, i can assure you.
B00C5GZKVQ|2.0|I didn't enjoy this at all. I found it hard to operate and kept crashing. I actually bought it for my husband before we went on a cruise, but he took one look and wasn't interested.
B008LV8TSU|3.0|I felt like it never quite got started. It was just ok for me. I guess I wanted more between the old women and the mystery man. I would like to see the movie to understand more of the book.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|But I am so glad I did. I love that their are several options, including game play and blades. My cat also happens to like this app!
0525952926|5.0|Anything Ken Follett writes is compeling.  This second in a trilogy of a family and politics extending from WWI thru WWII.

B001HNE3NO|5.0|The story of a family and particularly the sister, Sarah, who is suddenly ripped from their home and way of life.  They are taken to war camps.  Sarah is desperate to return home to rescue her little brother, who has been left behind.
140006922X|2.0|Reza Aslan's \\"Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth\\" resurrects the theory that Jesus' life and death are best explained against the background of Jewish zealot movements at the turn of the era. There is little here that is new. The ablest presentation of this line of interpretation was made by the British scholar S. G. F. Brandon in 1967. Few followed Brandon then; virtually no one does today. I doubt very much that Aslan's fresh take on it will win a following--at least not among scholars.<br /><br />Aslan, who is writing for non-experts, describes Jewish zealotry (largely in terms of zeal for the temple and for Israel's law of Moses) and surveys some of Israel's history between the Testaments. He reviews the attempts of a number of men who in one way or another sought to throw off either King Herod or the Roman yoke and win freedom for Israel. He places Jesus of Nazareth and his following squarely into this history and social setting. On this understanding, Jesus' proclamation of the coming kingdom of God was a call for regime change, for ending Roman hegemony over Israel and ending a corrupt and oppressive aristocratic priesthood.<br /><br />Aslan's core contention might be outlined as follows: The regime change that Jesus and his followers anticipated did not take place. Jesus was arrested and executed, along with two other rebels. Not long after--however it happened--Jesus' followers became convinced that their master had been raised from the dead and that his mission had not been a failure after all. Unlike other zealot movements that ceased after the deaths of their respective founders, the Jesus movement not only continued, even in the face of severe opposition. It flourished, soon reaching large numbers of non-Jews.<br /><br />This is where it gets interesting. With the conversion of Saul of Tarsus (who becomes the well-known Paul the apostle of New Testament letters and the book of Acts), the Jesus movement began to be pulled in two directions. One camp remained loyal to the very Jewish roots of Jesus and his family, while the other increasingly came to view Jesus as a divine figure, a figure very attractive to non-Jews who otherwise had little interest in traditional Jewish thinking and living. It was the latter wing of the Jewish movement that eventually won out, thus creating a new religion, one destined to have the most followers around the world. Ironically, what it became was not what its founder proclaimed or intended. Or so Aslan contends.<br /><br />Riddled with Errors<br /><br />There are numerous problems with Zealot, not least the fact that it heavily relies on an outdated and discredited thesis. But it also introduces a number of its own novel oddities and implausibilities. Aslan has canvassed much of the responsible scholarship in the field, but he does not always choose his options prudently. He often opts for extreme views and sometimes makes breathtaking assertions. I cannot help but wonder if Aslan's penchant for creative writing is part of the explanation. Indeed, Zealot often reads more like a novel than a work of historical analysis.<br /><br />Aslan assumes the latest possible dates for the Gospels and Acts, dating Mark after A.D. 70, Matthew and Luke-Acts in the 90s (perhaps later), and John somewhere between 100 and 120. After assigning such late dates he declares that there is no tradition of eyewitness accounts (without engaging Richard Bauckham's important book on this subject, Jesus and the Eyewitnesses). The circularity of this reasoning is hard to miss.<br /><br />Zealot is riddled with errors, probable errors, and exaggerations. Aslan tells us a builder in Nazareth had \\"little to do.\\" Excavations at Nazareth and nearby Sepphoris suggest otherwise. Being a builder (or \\"carpenter\\") meant that \\"Jesus would have belonged to the lowest class of peasants in first-century Palestine.\\" Where does this come from? Sepphoris, a major city of Galilee, is said to be \\"a day's walk\\" from Nazareth. Actually, it takes a jogger about 45 minutes. Scholars will be surprised to learn that the first-century Jewish prophet Jesus ben Ananias, mentioned by the historian Josephus, prophesied the \\"imminent return of the messiah.\\" He did no such thing.<br /><br />Aslan would have us believe that in an interval of one or two years (the time Jesus spent with John the Baptist) Galilee had become \\"urbanized, Hellenized, iniquitous.\\" Previously it had been a place of family farms, open fields, and blooming orchards. Excavations at Sepphoris indicate that even this large, somewhat Hellenized city had not adopted foods and customs contrary to Jewish law and traditions in the time of Jesus. In fact, excavations throughout Galilee have revealed how faithful to the law of Moses the people were. When Jesus commands the cleansed leper to show himself to the village priest and do as Moses commanded, Aslan thinks \\"Jesus is joking.\\" And his discussion of magic and miracles is confusing and inconsistent.<br /><br />There are further mistakes. Aslan consistently mishandles the Greek term for \\"apostles.\\" He assigns Eusebius to the third century, but the Christian apologist and historian flourished in the fourth century. He assumes throughout that Jesus and his disciples were illiterate (pg. 171: \\"they could neither read nor write\\"; pg. 178: \\"illiterate peasants from the backwoods of Galilee\\"). There is no engagement with scholarship that suggests otherwise. We are also told that James, the brother of Jesus, wore \\"simple garments made of linen, not wool.\\" But linen was worn by the wealthy (see Luke 16:19), not the poor and simple.<br /><br />Reader Beware<br /><br />The real problem of Zealot is seen in its exaggeration of the differences between Paul and the original apostles. There is no question that Paul sharply disagreed with Peter and other leaders over the question of the role of the law of Moses in the lives of non-Jewish converts. Aslan would have his readers believe that the debate centered on Christology, the divinity of Jesus, rather than on Ecclesiology, life in the church. But the debate as described in the book of Acts and in Paul's letters (especially Galatians) centers on food laws, Sabbath observance, and circumcision, not on the divinity of Jesus. Aslan would have done well to consult theologian David Wenham (author of Paul and Jesus) and others who show the misguided nature of claims that Paul invented Christianity.<br /><br />Recent media coverage has drawn attention to Aslan's Muslim heritage. As he himself explains, he was raised as a nominal Muslim, became a fundamentalist Christian as a teenager, and then abandoned his new faith after being exposed to biblical and historical criticism in his later education. Aslan earned a PhD in sociology and is now a professor of creative writing. I see nothing in his book that reflects distinctive Islamic beliefs about Jesus. The Qur'an, for example, explicitly asserts that Jesus was not executed, but rather one like him (Simon of Cyrene, who assisted Jesus in carrying the cross). Aslan contradicts this strange teaching (which apparently originated with the second-century heretic Basilides), rightly emphasizing the reality and brutality of Jesus' death on a Roman cross.<br /><br />At points Aslan's book is informative; it is often entertaining. But it is also rife with questionable assertions. Let the reader beware.<br /><br />(Craig A.

B000LXQVA4|2.0|So we had a jumper than hung from the door jam and my 4 month old just loves it. However, she can get overactive in it and actually hit her head on the side of the door post in one of her excited twirls. So I thought this would be a good replacement as the seat twists to explore different toys.  Now, my daughter is in the 95% percentile in height and her toes just barely hit the ground which added to the fact that once seated, her weight is too much (15.5 lbs) to propel the seat around to explore new toys.  The toys are kinda lame and only a few of them even entertain her.  I dont know how they get away with charging so much. It seems to be 3 times the price I should have paid.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I use this app all the time. I really like the rain sounds, although I don't see the need for there to be so many rain options, there are 8 or so.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|I didn't find this book as moving and heart wrenching as Hosseini's first 2 novels but even so, it is a worthwhile read.  His descriptions and narrative are so amazing in all his books it is an adventure to read any of them.

B0018RWMNM|5.0|I already owned the DVD version of Lonesome Dove and I recently pulled it out to watch it. The picture quality was poor compared to blu-rays I had recently watched. I recently purchased a blu-ray player and I have been amazed at the difference in some of the movies on blu-ray VS DVD. Not all the movies are improved a lot over the DVD version but Lonesome Dove is greatly improved. I am a big time fan of this movie and after watching part 1 on DVD I went online to see if the blu-ray version was available. It was and I purchased it on Amazon and I am really happy I did. The improvement over my DVD copy was amazing. I highly recommend the the blu-ray version of Lonesome Dove which is one of the most enjoyable movies made. The difference in the detail you see in the blu-ray really makes a world of difference in this classic. I would not say this about all the DVD's VS blu-ray but in this case I do. The blu-ray version is also the full length version so you do not miss a moment!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I loved playing the game.  My only problem with it was it is too short.  It just ends instead of moving on to a new place to explore.
B004VMUS9G|2.0|The alarm is very quite. Not impressed. Glad it was a free app. I don't think it is worth the time.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a good game to play.  It takes thought to do but is not overly difficult.  I don't have children but I think it would be a good game for them.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Even though Downton has seen its heyday since season 1, we can't but help to follow our beloved characters through another season. Season 3 deals life after the war and how the story will accommodate the actors who want to leave one the hottest television shows across the world.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Tony has great little anecdotes - theyre just strung together rather weirdly. His book goes back and forth between random stories, tips ... Nothing really has a point
B005Q1W10A|5.0|World War I is the big elephant in the room in season 2 affecting the personal and professional/casual lives of everyone at Downton. Love is in the air. Great season!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This story is the hero's journey in a fresh new way. Harold's discoveries as he walks are timeless and valuable.

Rebecca and Jillian!!!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I haven't read a Stephen King novel in a while, preferring more uplifting reading. 11/22/63 tackles a fascinating topic: what if you could go back in time and &#34;fix&#34; things, like maybe stop Oswald from assassinating JFK? I found myself skimming some of the book, mainly because I don't want graphic or gory images seared into my brain. But that being said there is much to savor in this tale. Recommended.  .

0425252868|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  You can't put this book down to you are finished and then you want to re-read again.  The book game me a glimpse how life was for the American pilots but how life was for the German people and pilots.  I did not realize how much the German people were under terrifying dictator rule.  You learn quick that the normal German Soilder was fighting for their homeland and not for Hitler.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|Game freezes and you have to restart it everytime,<br />Would not recommend it, too many gliches, needs to be fixed.
0525478817|5.0|This book was really great. The story is heart-wrenching and the characters are so loveable. It is definitely worth reading at least once.
1451626096|5.0|I love all of this authors' books. She has a way of bringing history to life and sparking a interest in a time period where few people want to go. this book is about King henry the Vlll 's  mother and father

B0000508U6|5.0|This is Coldplay's best album ever.  It's definitely more mellow, and the acoustic instrumentation later abandoned in much of Coldplay's works is much appreciated.  &#34;Spies&#34; is probably in my top three Coldplay songs.

B00867GHS8|5.0|I know that the top negative review states that the 3D is subdued in this movie, but that reviewer must have a really bad 3D TV.<br /><br />First, let's get a few things out of the way- your TV makes a difference (bad 3D TV = subdued 3D), your type of 3D TV makes a difference (active may give you headaches due to flickering effects and the weight of the glasses), and 3D does NOT mean that things need to fly out of your screen and into the middle of the room to qualify as 3D. In fact, the reason many people claim that 3D gives them headaches is due to too MUCH coming out towards you... so your best 3D films make use of the space IN the TV, not out of it. If you want 3D that shoots out at you, get a cheesy movie built poorly and enjoy the nausea.<br /><br />Why computer animation is SOOOO much better than live action is that with live action, many companies convert their films to 3D with the use of a computer, so things may look weird or out of place. Field depth may be off and you're seeing what the conversion computer thinks you should see. Avatar looked amazing in 3D because they literally built 2 cameras side by side which gave you a true-to-life 3D experience. In computer animation, they simply add another camera next to the original one and re-process the movie with the two cameras working together, just like Avatar. So in other words, it's true 3D, not converted.<br /><br />Finding Nemo is the best of the best when it comes to 3D. The fish may not come out of the screen at you often (though my daughter DID continually reach out toward them), they constantly look like they are swimming in true water. The floaties in every scene are constantly at different depths and flow with the water, making me feel like I was watching a giant tank. If you want to impress your friends, show them the scene where the jelly fish show up, the scene where the whale comes towards them (and in this version, coming toward YOU... creepy!!), and the seagull chase scene. I have yet to find a person who wasn't impressed (including several self-proclaimed 3D haters). It truly is astounding, and though I know the 3D splits the image for each eye, so technically you are seeing a lower resolution image in each, I swear that it looked better and I saw more detail in the 3D version than the 2D.<br /><br />After we watched this we immediately bought Monster's Inc in 3D... and yes, it too is just as impressive. Finding Nemo's 3D actually impressed me more than Avatar did, and those that have seen both on my TV agree with me. If you enjoy 3D at home with a really good 3D set, this is THE 3D movie you cannot pass up. If you're going to invest in some 3D movies, go with the Pixar computer animated features- you won't regret it. Don't buy just any animated feature based on the fact that they are in 3D, but when you get the best ones in 3D, it's worth the investment.<br /><br />(Edit: After quite a few 3D movies passing through my TV, this one still stands out as the absolute best. Again, this is the best 3D movie to date in my opinion.)nd a person who wasn't impressed (including several self-proclaimed 3D haters).

B005MLOKXA|5.0|Really enjoy the drama in this series. Thanks to Amazon Prime for making these episodes available. We really enjoy being able to go back and watch the pilot episode, then watch the following episodes in order. This is the only way to be able to know the complete storyline so that you have more understanding of the current episodes.

Though powerful and strong, Bruce Banner is still himself and able to reason.  Being the original one, anybody else only turns out bad.  A good movie though.  Janice

B0025KVLTC|5.0|Yes, I am post-era Beatles fan. I was born in the 70's, actually, and much to my regret. My mom was dancin' to this terrific music as a high-schooler, reading fan magazines and hanging posters of Paul in her gym locker. Well, I love The Beatles and I vote with so many others--including the great music critics from Rolling Stone, and other sources, that this is probably their best: Tax Man, Doctor Robert & Tomorrow Never Knows. So good--so wonderful. So uniquely the Beatles, the greatest band that ever lived.<br /><br />Admittedly, I am more of a John Lennon fan, but Paul McCartney performed the other night at the Outside Lands Festival, and it's the best I can get of that band and I am so grateful he and Ringo are still around.

1401937519|5.0|Anita Moorjani had cancer. She fought it every way she could. One day nearly four years later, her organs began shutting down. She was rushed to hospital, where she fell into a coma. As the doctors tried to save her and as her family was told that she had mere hours to live, Anita was undergoing a near death experience.<br /><br />In this book, Anita talks about this experience that changed her whole life. What makes this book valuable is, not only the revelation about what happens after we die, but she also provides the reader with excellent advice on how to live.<br /><br />Many times, books written by people who are not experienced writers are boring and poorly written. Not this book. Anita explains the unexplainable very well. This is a must for anyone wishing to improve their life and to find some answers. It is life changing!

B008QOFOQW|4.0|Had bought this at LegoLand and looked forward to building it with my daughter. (Who turns 6 in a few weeks). We stretched out the building into two sessions to make it more exciting for her. The instructions were very easy for an adult, and were simple enough that with direction, my daughter could follow along and find the pieces. She was able to find the pieces and follow the instruction booklet to put the pieces together (with her Dad's help). After we put the 3 pieces together, the plane, and ticket office, she was started playing with it and using it with out non lego characters. I really liked that she could build it and felt it was a great toy. I plan, one day to take it all apart and let her build it all over again. The set comes with a few extra tiny pieces.  This is a great toy, even on the young end. Good job, Lego.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have just finished playing this for 100+ hours of this game by the end of last week. Everything was awesome except no Hunger Games for it and not much multiplayer action included. Except that, it was the best Android games that I have ever played. Amazing and worth the price!

B000H4TX9I|5.0|Joss Whedon's universe is gloriously fresh and beautifully flawed. He paints the aftermath of the war of unification with bright strokes, showing the richness of the Alliance planets, and their mutual success, support, and military might, as well as the can-do, independent spirit of the rim worlds who struggle daily with the little they have. With an entire galaxy to play with, there's plenty of room for individual stories to portray the clashes that arise in such a widely variant setting. And our guides on that journey all have their own stories to tell along the way.<br /><br />On the smaller scale, some of the main characters aboard the Serenity have taken sides on the war issue--along with all its sub-issues, such as what jobs they're okay taking part in--and some haven't, creating a delightful mix of viewpoints on the everyday workings of the spacecraft and how to get by. And no one is inflexible; all the characters grow and change over the course of the series, organically adapting as we all do to new situations. Love, fear, loyalty, friendship, greed...it's all in there.<br /><br />The episodes take us to a vast range of locations--some poor, smarmy, struggling, and backstabbing, and some rich and flush with the new technology, and all that it entails. Captain Reynolds and his crew generally know what to expect in the former, but they know they must be constantly aware of shifting alliances and unseen trouble in the latter, as well. Basically, it's true what the character Zoe says about the captain: the war never ended for him. He has to fight every day for his ship and his crew, against everyone that survived the war he fought in. But he's clever and he's got a resourceful band of allies, and they do the best they can to keep flying.<br /><br />The dialogue in this series fascinates me.

B00571F26Y|5.0|The basic message is DON'T EAT ANYTHING THAT IS MADE WITH WHEAT. Of course, most people would argue this and point to the US Government dietary recommendations. Surprise! The government can be wrong - and in this case they're dead wrong. Consuming wheat is dangerous.
B0013KTGAG|5.0|Lots of unrealized potential. I kept waiting for the big scene that never came. Will defiantly delete this one. Yuck!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Of course, the criticisms fly - especially from fundamentalist Christians who haven't read the book (but HEARD it was bad). Dr. Aslan paints a picture of Jesus the man - a rebel. He was certainly crucified under the orders of Pontius Pilot who, contrary to most beliefs, wasn't the feeble ruler we find listening to his wife and washing his hands. He was a brutal killer who kept order by crucifying thousands of people for sedition. Jesus was one of them.<br /><br />Paul and his supporters reportedly generated the theological side of Jesus, a side that is different from what Aslan describes as Jesus the seditionist.<br /><br />The book finishes with, &#34;Because the one thing any comprehensive study of the historical Jesus should hopefully reveal is that Jesus of Nazareth - Jesus the man - is every bit as compelling, charismatic, and praiseworthy as Jesus the Christ. He is, in short, someone worth believing in.&#34;

B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Started off very confusing, so I put it down, it just was not reading smooth as his later works. I waited a few weeks and tried it again, this time I had no problems tucking into the persona of Harry Hole!!<br /><br />I love, love, love this character he is just so wasted and brilliant both converging and battling at the same time.  It never seems that there will be any redemption for Harry, but I keep hoping that there will, at some point<br />I would like to know what began his descent in his personal hell of drugs and alcohol, what demons chase Harry Hole each waking hour?
0307341577|5.0|Disclosure : I read Gone Girl first (which I just loved) then Sharp Objects, which was pretty disappointing. So I really hesitated ordering Dark Places since it got lots of mixed reviews. I'm glad that I trusted my gut and plowed on anyway.<br />To me as much as I enjoyed Gone Girl at first, I think Dark Places is a much deeper book. Gone Girl is very sleek, very smart. Brilliant smart, the kind of prose that makes a writer look good. It's very fast paced, and quite unrealistic in the second half. Like Ms Flynn started something so big and smart she didn't quite know how to keep up till the end.<br />Dark Places is a very different book. All characters have way more depth. Some are likable, some are hateable, some are pitiful. But all sound plausible and well researched.<br />It's a tale about the 80's, about what poverty does to decent people, how it makes weak, desperate, undecent after all. It talks about the cruelty of teenage years and high school rules. About very human and very primitive pulsions that we all have at some point and really aren't proud of.<br />There was a big deal about \\"animal cruelty\\" in previous reviews. I actually thought Ms Flynn handled it pretty soberly, describing only what needed to be, and didn't linger any longer than strictly necessary to make her point. You want animal cruelty ? Read the first pages of \\"The Karamasov Brothers\\" by genius Russian writer Dostoievski. I almost couldn't take it and considered dropping this masterpiece over those few pages. So yes there is a graphic description of a bull sacrifice in Dark Places, but it's short and stern enough that it's bearable.<br />Dark Places is a pretty lengthy book, the story unravels in many chapters spread over several major players of the story, over two periods of time, back in 1985, the very day of the killings, and \\"now\\". The main character, the survivor \\"little Libby\\" is very plausible, and despite her many flaws I deeply empathized with her. Given what's she's been through it's hard to be judgemental of her. Her mother, Patty, is a sweet, if totally overwhelmed woman, whom I felt much sympathy and quite a bit of pity for. She's unable to do right by her children and it kills her (literally, too). Ben, Libby's brother accused of the murders, is a lost kid going thru a bad phase, and the string of unfortunate events leading to the tragedy is pretty plausible.<br />One very strong point of Dark Places is how it looks at the same events from various people's point if view, and shows how we can feel so differently about one same thing. To each their own truth.<br />The other best feature of the book definitely is its beautiful's writing. Ms Flynne's prose is elegant and powerful. Gone Girl was a bit too fast paced to truly enjoy it, but in Dark Places it really shines.<br />Don't shy from this book, it's a beautiful one. Credible story, well crafted suspense, in-depth analysis of characters, and achingly beautiful prose. In my opinion the best Flynn's yet.
014241493X|5.0|Paper Towns is a novel for lovers of all genres.  It's a story of Quentin and Margo, his lifelong crush.  After Margo disappears, Quentin must follow her clues to find her.  The idea behind the title (which I won't give away) is very interesting and even got me to do some research on the topic after reading the novel.  I assure you, John Green didn't make up the concept of paper towns.<br /><br />Green writes the novel in a way that keeps you on the edge of your seat, never knowing what to expect.  This is a good read for teens and adults alike.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|POETRY AND LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I love the characters and I seriously love the story. The plot was amazing.  I love love love it!! Love is never clean and organized. They fell fast, but it was perfect- trust me you cannot share poetry with another soul without forging a bond. If you dont there never was something. The characters are hilarious and the plot is believable. I would suggest reading for a beautiful love story that so wonderfully illustrates how a poet would really fall in love &#60;3
1451696191|2.0|It's rare when I enjoy the movie version of a story better than the book version.  This is one of those stories.  I read the book first and wasn't impressed.  It just felt like a string of drugs, sex, and parties without any real point.<br /><br />I didn't like the writing style either.  It's written in a string of letters to an unnamed person.  The letters, though, aren't believable as letters.  They contain dialog and sequences that you would never find in a letter.  The book would have been better written in a normal first-person narrative format.<br /><br />I did really like the movie version of the story--watched it multiple times.  It makes me want to reread the book to see if I missed something, because I had totally different reactions to the two.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I finished this book I cried for forty five minutes! Its so beautiful. While at first it felt a bit far fetched it was all pulled together and ended so perfectly. I told every body i know the entire story because it captured me so much. It takes you through everything. READ IT!  Its so hard to stomach sometimes... But it really happens.. One can only hope the happily ever after does also:) I loved it!
0142418471|4.0|Will Grayson, Will Grayson is a charming, witty story, but I was a little disappointed after falling in love with all of John Green's other novels.  The structure of the books is really well thought out, Green and Levithan alternate writing chapters, each being the voice of a different Will Grayson.  One of the Will Graysons never uses capital letters in his writing, making it easy to determine which Will's voice you're reading.<br /><br />Tiny Cooper's play, which is a major part of the story, was a bit cheesy to me.  I love theater and musicals of all types, but I felt like the idea of Tiny's play was a little forced.  It seemed more like the authors were trying to get a theme across rather than letting the plot guide them.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I still enjoyed the book and am still a huge fan of John Green and David Levithan.

Promise me,okay?
0525478817|5.0|I was skeptical when I first picked up The Fault in Our Stars.  The plot seemed a little cheesy to me--a dying girl trying to find a crazy author she likes.  I bought it because it was on so many \\"Top Books for Teens\\" lists.  I thought maybe it would be good for my tenth grade students, but surely I wouldn't like it.<br /><br />BUT... Before I knew it, I had fallen in love with Green's characters and was completely lost in the story.  I think John Green could write about anything and make it enamoring.  I have since read every one of his books and can't wait for him to write a new one.<br /><br />And in case you didn't know, a film version of The Fault in Our Stars is currently in the works.  So now's the time to read it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|this is a great series! It kept my attention and interest in what was going to happen next.<br />thank you
0142410705|5.0|As a self-proclaimed nerd, I loved An Abundance of Katherines.  It's written in a different style from Green's other novels.  He no doubt channels his inner nerd in this one.  It's full of mathematical formulas, foreign languages, and footnotes.  But I assure you, you don't have to be a math genius to love the story.  Katherines is a coming-of-age story that most all teens can relate to.<br /><br />You don't have to be a nerd to love the story, but you do have to appreciate nerd-isms.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have read a bunch of post apocalypse type books, seen a lot movies, played a lot of games. Wool is a story I would love to see in all three mediums, because the world Hugh Howey has created has that kind of potential. Not only has he written great stories, but he has fostered a wonderful fanfic world as well. The stories that come out of this universe are not only entertaining, but diverse and so far all worth reading. Do yourself a huge favor, and start here, with the stories that began it all.
159514188X|5.0|Thirteen Reasons Why might just be the best young adult book I've read this year.  It's one of those books that you can't seem to put down.  You find yourself so immersed in the story that you somehow escape from your own reality.  The novel is not just a good story, but it has a positive message as well.  It calls the reader to think about how her actions affect others.  What we do may seem inconsequential at the time, but we never know what's going on in another person's world.<br /><br />I can definitely see myself rereading this book over and over again.

B000P407K4|5.0|As relevant as ever, and beautifully done, this movie was the start of what I consider Kubrick's best run of movies. And stop to consider that the next flick from Kubrick was 2001. George C. Scott really makes this movie, a serious actor in completely absurd role, and he plays it masterfully. Slim Pickins, awesome too. This is a movie you can easily watch over and over and never tire of.

B00DGNOMB6|4.0|Maggie Smith is, and always has been, versatile and multi-faceted as an actor.<br />She shows her acerbic, cutting wit and sarcasm in the &#34;public&#34; scenes of this film,<br />while reserving much of her acting gifts for &#34;alone&#34; moments. The cast includes former<br />performers, now in their very mature years. Dustin Hoffman's direction allows the story to<br />unfold  gracefully, even as the characters struggle with the challenges of aging and the &#34;used to be&#34;<br />realities of their lives. While not her greatest work, this film may be Smith's greatest gift to the rest of<br />the cast of Quartet, and Hoffman's gift to Americans who are not familiar with the wonderfully gifted supporting cast.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Much, much better than th Fifty Shades series. Story, characters, plot lines & mystery all made for an enjoyable read.
0307744434|5.0|This is storytelling at its best.  Right from page one, the circus is brought to life by talking to you, the reader, as if you were actually there.<br />\\"What kind of circus is only open at night?\\" people ask. ... You are amongst them, of course.  Your curiosity got the better of you....<br /><br />-Erin Morgenstern, The Night Circus pg 3<br /><br />Nothing in this story was random - not even the objects on the desk.  Everything meant something in this complex story and it was a joy to watch it all come together in such great ways.  The dialogue is funny and witty which reminded me of Downton Abbey since they are set in similar time periods.  I absolutely loved the writing.  There is such gorgeous and vivid imagery.  And I found this character description particularly charming:<br /><br />August turns out to be a pleasant, heavyset fellow and Bailey's first impression is that he resembles his house: a squat sort of building with a porch wrapping around the front, warm and welcoming.<br /><br />-Erin Morgenstern, The Night Circus pg 332<br /><br />The romance in this book was exquisite.  The girl is abused. The boy is neglected.  One is taught by experience and the other by books.  I loved watching how they connect.  They balance each other in a way that makes them be so much more when they are together than when they are apart. This is a story about how love is more powerful than fighting.  The circus becomes an amazing symbol of their love.  The ending was so perfect.  There was love and loss - anything else would have been a crime against the story.<br /><br />I loved the twist on magic.  It was mystical, dreamlike, and mysterious but at the same time there was a feeling that magic could be learned by everyone if you could really see the world without judgement.  And the reason that magic has slowly disappeared is because there are no more secrets anymore.  The idea of the magic contained in secrets made me think about if The Night Circus had a modern setting, itwouldn't have had the same mystery and thrill to it.  The existence of twitter alone would have completely ruined the excitement and magic of the circus.  It made me realize that there really is magic in secrets.<br /><br />The characters were a delight.  I loved the stage magician that could do real magic. There's a boy that runs away to the circus and somehow it's not cliche.  And that same boy dreams of being a princess in a fairy tale that gets whisked away from his problems.  I found that so completely endearing.  I wanted to be one of the reveurs that follow the circus like addicted fangirls.<br /><br />Overall, this was a magical and unique love story that delighted me from start to finish.

And there are no words to describe DDL's presentation of Lincoln in this movie except that he got it-what Lincoln was all about.  I am so glad there is a movie out for this generation to actually learn history through the movies!  Last of the Mohicans with DDL was mostly fabrication, but he made you SEE the life of a Native American at that time and how they were tricked by the US military and how much they have suffered for centuries in the the white man's lies.

B00A2LFXVI|1.0|I appear to be the minority when it come to what I think of this movie.  I liked Part 1, I thought it had a pretty good story line and lots of excitement and a few twists and turns that I didn't see coming (like Batman having to adjust his tactics in battle because he's retirement age and his body can't do what it used to be able to do to defeat someone in hand to hand combat).  When I saw Part 2 would have The Joker as its central villian I thought it couldn't go wrong.  I was wrong.  I was expecting The Joker, eventhough he's retirement age like Batman, to be his loud, cackleing, over the top self (if you're familiar with the franchise, I was expecting him to be like the way Mark Hammil portrayed him in the tv series and in several movies).  Boy was I wrong.  This Joker still kills people, but he's soft spoken, and seems like he's just going through the motions of what everyone thinks he's supposed to do, it's almost like he's a shadow of his former self, granted he's been in a vegetative state since Batman retired but how much effort does it really take to at least sound like your enthused about getting the best of the hero.  The Joker's almost complete lack of enthuisaism, by itself is what caused me to give the movie one star.  A lacklust Joker is no Joker at all.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved every minute!  This is a fantastically hast erotic series...great dynamics and really detailed scenes that can get your blood pumping!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|For those who are looking for a departure from the ordinary and into the abnosome - this is the series to check out. It features interesting world-building, a rich mytharc and some of the best characters of any TV show. If you're a fan of horror, suspense, and great characterization, give this show a try - it's entering into its 9th season so there's a whole lot of awesome to catch up on.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|3.5 stars. I liked it....liked the characters, especially Holder. Natch! He's great book boyfriend material and CH writes a good YA Hero. Who didn't love Will (Slammed), right?! Good romantic drama, except for some reason I was all caught up in the story UNTIL the drama. Once the drama began there was so much head rambling I started to get bored which then resulted in my skimming pages. This was a surprisingly different storyline which was a plus but I just got bogged down with all the overly wordy thoughts.  I'm the odd one out here; I didn't love this one as much as everyone else, so it was just above okay for me.  Also a bit disappointed in the \\"first kiss\\". My anticipation was so built up only to culminate in nothing special, IMO. Just a hot mess of what seemed to me to be a mad make out fest (I wanted more slow drawn out details, darn it!). I wanted as much satisfaction out of the actual kiss as I got out of Holder's talk about how it would be (Now that was HOT!). So glad there's a 2nd bk since this one seemed to have left out a few details this story needs before I feel like it can successfully conclude.
B0065IZEE8|5.0|James (Benedict Cumberbatch) has terminal cancer and as a swan song he wants to go to his favourite place one more time before the Grim Reaper makes an early appearance. In order to help him he takes his three longest and dearest friends to help him. They are Davey, Miles and Bill and they have made a special wheel chair to get him to the stunning Welsh coast line of Barafundle Bay.<br /><br />He needs his medication which he taking in higher dosage to deal with the pain, but on the way he is determined to make the most of his trip. They have a long trip ahead of them and he wants it to be just them, no mobile phones etc. As there progress continues events conspire to throw up all manner of issues from the past and even some from the future and cracks in the friendships soon appear which they are forced to deal with.<br /><br />Life is a journey and the metaphor here is obvious. For the viewer to care the characters have to be both believable and likeable, and to a great extent they manage to achieve this; despite some very juvenile pranks along the way. The cast put in some commendable performances and the scenery and framing of the shots is all excellent. It deals with the issues around death but also that of a life lived well and how one judges it. I found it to be compelling, moving and a rewarding watch. Made by the BBC in association with the Welsh Film Board this is what the BBC do best, a great drama. Well made, acted and makes you think - recommended
B00AREIAI8|5.0|When I first bought this app I didn't have enough room in my device for it .and I<br />deleted allot of apps because I rilly wanted it and when I finally got it installed I was so happy I almost was crying. it is a AWSOME game for horse lover's

B00CXN2JNS|4.0|This is not the Megadeth from the old days or even Endgame or 13.  Not really a thrash record.  Leans more towards the hard rock genre.  It took me a few listens to &#34;get it.&#34;  Dave Ellefson makes his presense be known of this record.  Solos from Mustaine and Broderick are good, but tame.  Overall a good record, but does not satisfy the thrash that I was hoping to hear.

B009POCG0Y|1.0|I'm a fan of Matthew McConaughey. The movie starts with one of the main characters (female) answering a door without her underwear on and you get a good look at her pubic area. It only got worse from there. It could have been a compelling (in a sick red neck way) story, however the end where McConaughey has this same female character on her knees in front of him performing fellatio on a piece of chicken leg held at his groin...........leading to him having an orgasm is one of the sickest scenes I have ever seen in an R rated movie. I'm surprised that McConaughey actually permitted himself to take part in a scene like this. Ugh.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Setup was very easy.<br /><br />I had been looking into possibly purchasing a wireless HDMI transmitter which would have cost at least a couple hundred bucks, in order to be able to stream some web content (e.g. korean dramas from a popular online site), but decided against it as I strongly suspected that it would probably not work too well through walls.<br />Basically, with this Google Chromecast, and it's tab casting feature, I am able to view those Korean dramas on my big screen tv seamlessly and easily.  Quality is pretty decent, although I just realized that the default setting at the aforementioned site is only 360p (I'll most likely do some experiments with setting it to 480p/720p). But even the 360p setting is very watchable on my 50\\" tv. Interestingly, in my particular case, my computer is connected via wifi, so basically my computer is streaming the video via wifi and then casting the video via wifi to the Google Chromecast gadget. So even though it's maintaining two concurrent wifi streaming connections (from Internet to computer + computer to the Google Chromecast dongle), it's very acceptable in terms of the video quality and performance.<br /><br />Once I had enabled the HDMI-CEC feature on my plasma tv, the Google Chromecast gadget will actually turn on my tv and switch to the correct hdmi input automatically, which is *very* cool.<br />So I can cast a YouTube video to my television and it will automatically turn on my tv and start displaying the video. Without the HDMI-CEC feature, I would normally have had to manually turn on my tv, switch the hdmi input to the hdmi input corresponding to my Google Chromecast gadget. Note that your television has to support HDMI-CEC and you may then have to manually enable it (check your tv's menu settings). For my television, the option was called: AnyNet+ (HDMI-CEC), and I had to explicitly enable it.<br /><br />So far both Chrome casting, via YouTube and Netflix, and Chrome browser tab casting have worked almostflawlessly.<br /><br />Helpful Tip: I changed my computer monitor's resolution setting from 1920x1200 to 1920x1080, so that the Google tab casting feature would work better with my 1920x1080 tv. Prior to this change, sometimes the video subtitles would get cut off, in fullscreen mode, due to the differing resolutions between my computer monitor and my television.  Hopefully, Google will update their tab casting feature so that the user can specify that he/she wants to cast the full screen to either a 1920x1080/720x1280 screen target, instead of using the computer monitor's fullscreen resolution.<br /><br />The one downside, is that once you start the playing the video, there's no easy way to do a 10 second rewind or pause the video (bathroom break, etc). One workaround is to use the Wyse PocketCloud app from my iPad/iPhone/iTouch to remotely login to my computer to pause playback, but this is a bit awkward..<br /><br />As an aside, I think I made the cutoff for the free Netflix 3 month promotion by about 8 minutes, so my effective price for this dongle was about 11 bucks ! :).
0786915749|5.0|The Dragonlance Chronicles are my favorite books ever. I could not get enough and they inspired a life long fascination with fantasy. They are great for any age group and will pull you in hook, line, and sinker. A+

B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Not the best movie of the year. But it was entertaining. I got the plot have way through the movie.
0425263908|5.0|Bared to You shares some of the same characteristics that you will find in Fifty Shades of Grey. There is an indecent proposal followed by lots of sex and a relationship that struggles to stay afloat in the wake of two complicated people trying to determine what they really want. The differences you will find will be the lack of chains, whipping, and spanking. I wouldn't dare call the Crossfire series 'tame,' but it does lack the sexual domineering deviancy of Fifty Shades. The writing is also phonemically better.<br /><br />Erotica is certainly not for all 'romance' readers. This book contains a lot of language and vivid descriptions of sexual acts. With that said, the 'romance' part of the story is intriguing. As the romance between Gideon and Eva blooms, the momentum amplifies making the book harder and harder to put down. One of the main things I really like about both Fifty Shades and Crossfire is the comedic battering between the couples from the moment they meet. Both Eva and Ana (female character in Fifty Shades) have spunk. I found myself laughing out loud on numerous occasions.<br /><br />\\"B.O.B. and I have a longtime understanding - when we're done with each other, we know exactly which one of us has been used, and it isn't me. Good night Gideon.\\"<br />― Sylvia Day, Bared to You<br /><br />\\"Sex that's planned like a business transaction is a turnoff for me..... Listen to yourself. Why even call it a f***? Why not be clear and call it a seminal emission in a pre-approved orifice?\\" (Eva to Gideon)<br />― Sylvia Day, Bared to You<br /><br />Despite the indecency of the initial proposal, Gideon and Eva fall hopelessly in love, and their love for one another changes both of their lives forever. If your new to this genre, I would suggest reading the Crossfire Series over the Fifty Shades Series. It's slightly less scandalous.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|The book was extremely easy to read. It was fast paced an exciting. Good book for someone who likes a fast paced suspense novel.

B006O5YHUY|5.0|I saw this three times when it was in theaters and have found myself thinking about it over and over again. Watching it on DVD proved that it still held up (and I still want to know: what happened next?)<br /><br />The extras are also interesting

B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I am enjoying playing this game.  I just wish the levels gradually got more difficult.  But it is fun to take my mind off things for a while.
B0042EJD5I|5.0|I'm not here to talk about the music itself, rather the sound quality and packaging of the 200 gram re-issue. I purchased an original US pressing on Atlantic (not the UK pink label, unfortunately), thinking that many original pressings are said to sound better than quickly-done re-issues. Wow, was I wrong. The pressing was atrocious. So, I grabbed this 200 gram re-issue after reading all the great reviews. It sounds infinitely better and is the best version of this album that I've yet heard (I have not listened to the Steven Wilson 5.1 mix...yet). The packaging is pretty good. The gatefold could be slightly more heavy-duty, but is still great. The music quality itself is absolutely astounding on this re-issue.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|It is fair to have in game purchases. However, eventually this game will &quot;force&quot; you to buy tokens because it no longer gives them in time intervals. I find this crazy given the numerous games that let you keep playing, but either at a slow pace, or at a disadvantage. Furthermore, anyone who does not s make an in game purchase will get bombarded with ads, so it isn't like the company is making no money for those who don't make an in store purchase. I would advise people to try other jversions of this or even other games if they want to find something they can keep playing without a forced purchase. One more thing in that this game's current download should either be a test drive, or it should be noted as a demo, as again there really isn't't anything completely free.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game!!! I love how its almost like real life cities and plus I make money while I'm sleep which makes me have loads of cash in the morning!!$$ this is truly one of my favorite games.

B00CW7KK9K|3.0|Setting the Pulse up is not for the faint of heart. In attempting to set up the app on my Samsung Galaxy S4 (Android) phone - you can't do it on a computer, must use a tablet or smartphone - it hung after I entered my name. After nearly 30 minutes of messing around the phone app decided that it would use the first name I entered after all. I would guess it took it the first time, just didn't admit it. I have no idea where it got the birth date. I didn't bother trying to change it, too much aggravation.<br /><br />The Pulse is light. The clip is light and soft - you really don't know it is there - and seems secure. I lost an original Fitbit because the clip was not secure. The sleep wristband is also light and soft.<br /><br />You need a smartphone which allows two simultaneous bluetooth connections if you have an earpiece, speakers or anything else bluetooth or one has to turn off so the Pulse can sync. Mine can handle doing that itself but other phones might require you to do it manually.<br /><br />The Pulse can connect with MyFitnessPal - which wasn't seamless either - and RunKeeper which I haven't done yet.<br /><br />Bottom line - good, not great.<br /><br />I compared the Pulse in right pocket, Samsung G4 pedometer in my left. At 10,000 steps the difference was 1,500. No way to know which is accurate.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The first person interview format is interesting. It gives the reader insight to the way other countries deal with the same issue.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This was good but their has to to be something to do at the end of the game like some races that gett harder as you go or something plus the stupid glitch where you touch a plane whith a car you die for no reason happened to me hundreds of times<br />but it is the best game i have played.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This is a great no-frills live concert DVD with excellent sound and video of the greatest band of all time...every LZ fan should have this.
B001XUJNJ0|5.0|I've been waiting to watch this with my teenage son, until I felt he was old enough to handle the subject matter and language.  It's been a favorite of mine since I saw it in the theater long ago. I knew it was rated R but I had forgotten the details!  WOW, this movie hasn't faded one bit in 20 years...it's a period movie so it's not dated in the least.  Every detail of this movie is perfect. As another reviewer mentioned, there is nothing in this movie that should have been edited out...it's just one perfect scene and line of dialogue after another, until the tear-jerking ending. The music is lovely and adds much to the atmosphere.  You feel trapped along with Andy, feel his pain and anguish, and root for him and his friends as they bring life to Shawshank Prison. The character of the warden is not only an evil villain, he is believable and you will TOTALLY despise him.  This movie is just amazing and inspiring.  My son is 16 and he agrees!  Watching this on DVD...make sure you can watch it all the way through without stopping...it's that riveting.
B00632HWOG|3.0|My sister says it's great but it won't let me sign in, if I try to make a new account the same thing happens, and I think it's just not worth all the trouble.

1419703692|5.0|To see more pictures from the book, please visit my blog via my Amazon profile link.<br /><br />The Art And Making Of The Dark Knight Trilogy is a big 300 paged hard cover book detailing the making of Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy of films. Its really more a \\"making of\\" rather than an \\"art of\\" book, although there are dozens of conceptual sketches and art work scattered throughout the book.<br /><br />There's way too much content in here to cover with just a dozen pictures. (pls visit my blog for more images from the book - my blog link can be found on my amazon profile link) If you spend a good afternoon reading through the whole book and then revisit the films I'm really sure you'll be much more appreciative of the filmmakers efforts and hard work. Very highly recommended.
B003XF1OK4|4.0|so it arrived on time in great condition, obviously (ha ha). Never dull, and at times very moving. Beautifully written.

B006ZAZ31U|4.0|Love of God, his wife, his children, family, team members and humanity - this describes Adam Brown.  I knew going into reading this book that he did not live a long life.  What I did not expect was how much this book touched me emotionally.<br />Adam Brown's life is a reflection of the goodness we wish we could see in all men.  I believe he is singing with the angels, praising the creator of ALL!
B001AQQR2S|4.0|Good family fun that every on will watch and cheer for the underdog. Kids of all ages will enjoy this movie.
B005OKTPKC|3.0|Disappointed when bearing in mind that the book is by one of my favourite writers. Hope that the future from the author will not be as disappointing.

B001A50716|3.0|Back when Johnny Depp movies were birthed from ideas and not amusement park rides, this curiousity was unleashed upon an unsuspecting  (and largely absent) audience. Having seen both the truncated U.S. version and the longer, European cut, I would recommend seeing the full version, though it adds little in substance. Arizona Dream is a ponderous, dreamy project adorned with surrealistic touches and abstract scenes of behavior with no real purpose. The journey is the thing. And, truth be told, it can be a tedious and repetitive one. But it also feels alive in creative spirit and taps into that zeitgeist when films were trying to be more than enterprises. Not a complete success, but you have a writer, director and cast playing jazz in trying to figure things out. They caught the halibut, but it got away from them as well. You decide.
B0083Z614S|5.0|A favorite story that I will enjoy with my Granddaughter. I am growing her a secret garden so we can play.

B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|the book is better.  A lot of the characters have been changed or not even included, takes away from the story.
B00BQ1D7X4|3.0|It's not as good as the last Alice in Chains album, Black Gives Way to Blue.  It's not bad, just not as good in my book.  Seems a big departure from Staley years.
B00DU74U74|4.0|I liked it, similar story line to the book. Enjoyable not the best character selection but still a good movie.
B00AQO1VYY|5.0|I bought the CD when it came out, and liked it, but didn't love it.  I revisited it several times, and sometimes the connection just isn't there.  I brought it out again in about 2008, and BAM, it's one of my favorite CD's.  I really liked the SAP & Jar of Flies albums, and this fit in pretty well with those.  The live video version of Long Gone Day and the All Alone jam were well worth the price of the set for me.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|You can find this review at My Favorite Things (heffroberts.blogspot.com)<br /><br />Entwined with You by Sylvia Daywas a thoroughly enjoyable read. It doesn't have a cliffhanger at the end so waiting for Captivated by You won't be too torturous.<br /><br />There are moments in book two where weird, unexplained things happen...<br />- Eva's mom's reaction after lunch one day, getting pale and shaky.<br />- Eva assuming Gideon was seeing Corinne when she saw her leaving the Crossfire building looking very disheveled.<br />- She later finds red lipstick [?] on Gideons sleeve and he has just gotten out of the shower. He has no good explanation.<br /><br />We learn how all these pull together into a much more sinister and potentially dangerous situation for Eva.<br /><br />So Book three begins with Eva and Gideon still estranged. Eva thinks she knows what happened, but she doesn't know everything, yet.<br /><br />In this book we get to see them re-connect and it is HOT!!!!<br /><br />I like that Steven and Mark are a slightly bigger part of the story.<br /><br />Audible Audiobook \\"Review: Crossfire # 3: Entwined With You\\"<br />Would you listen to Entwined With You again? Why?<br />Yes, I might listen to Entwined With You again, time allowing, just before book four will be released.<br /><br />What other book might you compare Entwined With You to and why?<br />Of the books I have read, I would compare Entwined With you to \\"All In\\" and \\"Eyes Wide Open\\" by Raine Miller.<br /><br />What about Jill Redfield's performance did you like?<br />Jill Redfield is an excellent audiobook performer. Her voice can transition through the characters without sounding forced or fake. She IS Gideon, she IS Eva. It was a pleasure to listen to.<br /><br />If you were to make a film of this book, what would the tag line be?<br />Gideon has done everything to be with Eva and keep her safe but will it be enough?<br /><br />\\"Careful, Eva.\\" Gideon shot me a stern look. \\"Or you'll derail my attempt to seduce you properly before I ride you on every flat surface in this apartment.\\"<br /><br />If souls could be mated with wishes, ours would be inextricably entwined.<br /><br />We were completely entwined, grasping and pulling at each other...<br /><br />I thought this next one was hilarious...<br />His lips thinned. \\"I have to go deal with Christopher. Are we okay?\\"<br />Nodding, I said, \\"I'm good. You?\\"<br />\\"As long as Kline doesn't kiss you.\\" The warning was clear in his voice.<br />\\"Same goes.\\"<br />\\"If he kisses me, he's getting decked.\\"t to seduce you properly before I ride you on every flat surface in this apartment.\\"<br /><br />If souls could be mated with wishes, ours would be inextricably entwined.<br /><br />We were completely entwined, grasping and pulling at each other...<br /><br />I thought this next one was hilarious...<br />His lips thinned. \\"I have to go deal with Christopher.

B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|If you love tetris odds are very good that you will love this game! The pieces don't fall from the sky at the normal tetris rate and depending on what type of game play you are playing will determine how the pieces fall. Slide the pieces left or right and make that solid line to make it disappear. The games menu is put together very well and the only thing I'd change about this game is the ability to mute the sound or music while playing a game instead of having to go back out to the menu to do it.
0770437400|5.0|Love the book, a good read for the summer, especially with the movie already out and coming to DVD soon.
B008602KQI|5.0|Who'd have thought someone could take Rollerball's premise into Fritz Lange's Metropolis future and score with an intriguing and poignant commentary on our society?  The only actors that I really recognized we're Donald Sutherland and Woody Harrelson, both of whom take on unusual and often difficult films and make them incredible.  They did that here, but the young actors of this movie performed at Donald's and Woody's level to make he entire movie a true cinematic experience!

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I received my Chromecast this past Saturday. Took less than 2 minutes to open package and setup and I was \\"casting\\" YouTube videos. (Full disclosure, I installed the Chromecast app on my Android tablet weeks ago in anticipation of receiving my Chromecast) If this takes you longer than 5 minutes to setup you should not be doing things like driving cars.<br /><br />Works great. I decided to get rid of my smart Blu-ray player and get a dumb DVD player for ten bucks. I don't need the apps anymore, I don't rent/buy Blu-rays and I only used the 3D functionality once (the day I got it).<br /><br />With the Chromecast we no longer need TV's and DVD players to be \\"smart\\". What we need is for new televisions to have Chromecast built-in and for all streaming media services (ie MLB.TV, Hulu+, Amazon Instant, etc.) to build the ability to \\"cast\\" into their mobile apps.<br /><br />Update 08/17/2013<br />I have to say the packaging is really nice. I keep it next to me on the couch so I can admire it and I open and close the box and it makes me giddy. I even sleep with it next to me on my pillow so I can feel close to my Chromecast. And I actually love the weird smell that pervades the Chromecast's packaging. I even sniff it. I think it smells like new car.<br /><br />When you airplay something does an Apple TV turn on your television and switch it to the correct input automatically? I doubt it. And therein lies the magic of the Chromecast.
B008Y73940|5.0|Multiple anticipation on the outcome, was a great finish, and unexpected.  Great action movie. Acting was supurb.  Will keep in my library for future screenings over and ove.
B000Y7U98C|2.0|This is an ambitious but not really successful British SF film. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.<br /><br />It is the Year of Grace 2057 and our sun is dying. A first attempt to re-ignite it, by spaceship &#34;Icarus&#34;, failed for unknown reasons (the ship disappeared without trace). A second mission is launched - spaceship &#34;Icarus II&#34;, carrying an enormous &#34;star-bomb device&#34;, passed already the orbit of Mercury and is now on approach towards the Sun. Then, the radars detect an object which should not be there... And then the film really begins.<br /><br />Renowned director Danny Boyle tried to make a very ambitious SF film here, but as far as my perception of this film is concerned he succeeded only partially. So let's begin with the good stuff, before the criticism:<br /><br />1) The director certainly gathered quite an ensemble cast and made all the actors perform well. The crew of &#34;Icarus II&#34; is made of following people:<br /><br />- Captain Kaneda (Hiroyuki Sanada). Sanada is an excellent actor, who impressed me in &#34;Twilight Samurai&#34; - here he is very credible as the skipper of the most important ship in human history...<br /><br />- Second-in-command/communication officer Harvey (Troy Garity). Never saw this guy in anything before - but he is OK in this film.<br /><br />- Physicist Robert Capa (Cillian Murphy). This is an important character and Murphy played him very well.<br /><br />- Pilot Cassie (Rose Byrne). Another important character and also well played - and this is a high praise coming from me, because I usually REALLY don't like this actress (since I saw her ruining Briseis character in &#34;Troy&#34;)<br /><br />- Engineer Mace (Chris Evans). Again not one of my favourite actors - I found him pale and perfectly forgettable in both &#34;Fantastic Four&#34; and &#34;Avengers&#34; (I didn't see &#34;Captain America&#34;), but once again, a honest performance here.<br /><br />- Doctor/psychological officer Searle (Cliff Curtis). Well, the Fire Lord Ozai can do no wrong - he managed to shine even in a turkey like 10,000BC! A pleasure to watch him.<br /><br />- Biologist Corazon (Michelle Yeoh). Doctor Corazon who takes care of &#34;oxygen garden&#34; of &#34;Icarus II&#34; is my favourite character in the whole film - and this is once again a high praise coming from me, because she is also my all-times least favourite James Bond girl!<br /><br />- Navigator Trey (Benedict Wong). No problem with the actor, but his character is a horror (see below)!<br /><br />2) Danny Boyle used also a relatively high-budget (for a non-Hollywoodian film) and it shows on the screen. Visually &#34;Sunshine&#34; is very pleasant and by moments pretty impressive.<br /><br />3) The soundtrack is very honest.<br /><br />4) I rather liked the ultimate scenes.<br /><br />Sadly, there are also things which I liked much less, beginning with the most benign. WARNING! Some SPOILERS here!<br /><br />1. Who on Earth could name a ship on such a mission &#34;Icarus&#34;? TWICE!? God Almighty, that is possibly the LEAST appropriate name EVER? Why not say things strait and name the ship &#34;My wings will melt and I will fail&#34;?<br /><br />2. The whole fate of humanity depends of those missions and amongst the 16 people selected from ALL HUMAN KIND for those two missions you still manage to put a barking mad mouth-foaming murderous LUNATIC on board of one ship and a completely uncompetent, distracted, careless MORON on board of another one? Who wrote that scenario - the &#34;Prometheus&#34; guy?<br /><br />3. The film takes itself too seriously. Not even one moment of second degree and/or humor. And even people on the death row sometimes joke...<br /><br />4. SPOILER here. The thing which disgusted me the most - again, the bashing of religion and of religious people. Jeez, this is such a clich&eacute; amongst the movie makers - honestly, when and where in the real world have you seen Christians murder fire-fighters and/or paramedic who save other people, just because they consider it is &#34;God's will&#34; that people die and therefore trying to save them is a sin...? When and where did you hear Christians say &#34;Let's not rescue the victims of earthquakes, typhoons and such, because God wanted them to die and we must not contradict him&#34;. I never heard of such a thing, but in cinema you keep seeing it again and again and again... Well even if Mr Boyle and his pairs hate so much God, the religion and religious people I still say to them &#34;God bless and all the best for you, your family and all those you care for&#34;. Amen.<br /><br />Bottom line, I liked this film much less than I expected to and than I wanted to. Good general idea, good actors, visually splendid - but an abysmally stupid and completely unbelievable plot, treated as seriously as Gospels...))) Watch at your own risk and make your own mind about it.where did you hear Christians say &#34;Let's not rescue the victims of earthquakes, typhoons and such, because God wanted them to die and we must not contradict him&#34;.

0062015176|4.0|Huge fan of Allen Ginsberg and what this poem did was revolutionary! With that said, I must admit the poem at times is lengthy and has a bit of drag to it. Now calm down, I still love it and have a CD with Ginsberg reading it. The words and imagery created by  \\"Howl\\" are a slam to the face at times. It is a very powerful poem and I feel the Eric Drooker illustration helps convey the essence of Ginsberg's words. Does it always go hand-in-hand - no, but it does help move the poem with a better flow than just reading it.  Even without the poem, Drooker's work is great and can be judged separately.  The illustration on page 12 that goes with the Introduction by Drooker is my favorite, and clearly demonstrates his ability. The illustration is of an eagle soaring over a collection of buildings that form a maze. The eagle is heading toward a setting sun.  Wonderful imagery for a powerful poem. It is the kind of book you will pull down off your shelf and just gaze at the art work. It makes a great poem even better.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It was o.k.<br />I started reading this book and almost didn't get to the middle and was pleasantly surprised by the twist.  the ending was ridiculous which made the whole book a disappointment.
B000W23H8S|5.0|another great album from the Police featuring the title track, Walking in Your Footsteps, Miss Gradenko, Every Breath You Take,  King of Pain and six other great songs.  veering away from the heavy reggae beats and into ballad rock territory, the Police show they are not just a one style act.
B009H7SCMA|5.0|Gabriella Blenkinsop, delightful socialite and member of the aristocracy, meets her match in the form of 'Jim,' both literally and figuratively speaking. He's a decent sort of chap, but short of a title and a few bob. This is a delightful comic romp, featuring all the classics: love at first site, poetic justice and the age old class battle for supremacy.<br /><br />Who will win the cricket match? Will the lovely Gabriella be able to entrance Jim away from his working class roots and will Chivers (the deliciously amusing butler) be able to save the day?<br /><br />It's a read quite unlike any other. Loved it.
B007Z9QTVI|5.0|Really, this is the best movie ever made.  Brilliant kid from the hood who can hoop with the best, a grumpy old Scotsman who may be the best author of his generation, and Busta Rhymes.  What's not to love?
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love Harvey and Mike!  Nice to have a show with a great story line.  This show is really really addicting!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I like the visuals and movement of this app.<br />It moves fast and the island graphics are fun to move through.<br />I don't really like hitting pelicans, but it is quite funny, when I do.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This story is unparalleled in my experience. The character, lovable, the story, amazing and shocking. Such a story, no one could not love. Everything fits, everything works. Though in the beginning it was confusing everything began to fit together. It was absolutely outstanding.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just can't seem to stop playing the game it's so addictive if you ain't playing this you ain't living
B0044XUZ9K|5.0|Treasure Island is a classic for a reason--it is a book that everyone should read.  Well-written, great plot, interesting characters, scenic setting--this book has it all.  Better than Pirates of the Caribbean<br />, which was very good.
B00DM0XXCM|2.0|A love story separated by two worlds, one being up the other down...huh, ok I get it.  Dear physicists this is not for you, as gravity would rip the two worlds apart and leave a &#34;what the hell&#34; splinter in your mind all the way through.  That being said, the movie tells a tail of a boy and a girl from two different worlds &#34;literally&#34; that meet on two different mountain tops pointing towards one another as the planets are only what appear to be one hundred meters apart...uhhhh, bare with me here.  As they figure out a way to actually get closer to each other &#34;A Rope&#34; if thrown high enough from one planet the gravity from the other grabs the rope, and the person on the upper planet can then.....Oh hell, just watch it, its almost worth the rental fee...

B00942Y0TM|4.0|It's really hard to find a good movie for little ones that doesn't scare the crap out of them at some point. This and Cars are my fav's for my 2.5 year old.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I wish Brett and Cornine would leave Giedon and Eva alone. They are together and meant to be together. I hope everything works for them. They have been through so much. I still love the way he talks to her and needs her. I am patietly waiting for the next book in the series. I'm hooked!!!!
B001FA0NZ6|3.0|this book was ok, but the instructions were a little vague. i didnt really learn anything that i didnt already know and wasnt overly impessed with the photagraphy or quality of the makeup applied to the models faces. my advice, save your money for a better book.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The suspense with this book keeps you on the edge of your seat and I still love the way he needs her and talks to her.
