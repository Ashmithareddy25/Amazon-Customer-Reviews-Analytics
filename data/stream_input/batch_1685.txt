B007N5YIUS|3.0|Same amount of fun as the other Birds games, with the extra challenge of anti-gravity.<br /><br />I only gave it 3 stars, because it runs glitchy on my Galaxy and Kindle Fire, and freezes on startup on my son's Polaroid tablet.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|You know, I really don't care what other people say about this movie. I love it. Since receiving my DVD, I have watched it 4 times and each time, notice something else. Am eagerly anticipating the next installment, whether it's the next Iron Man or one of the other many characters. I hope to see more of the other possible Avenger's appear as they did in the comic books. Also, Blue Ray is the best possible way to see all the movie. Crisp clear viewing. Great entertainment.
B00138KJ5Y|5.0|Heartwarming music for \\"the soul\\".  Impressive and far MORE impressive in a live concert.  Their voices are fabulous alone or \\"as one\\"..\\"IL Divo\\"
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is crazy good .. every episode leaves you wanting more.. I would watch it all day if I could
B007FJFDXS|4.0|This game is fun and challenging, the simple appearance hides some truly devilish challenges and fun, sense levels. I play on a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 and find no problems but can see how a small screen may find difficulty and would recommend a mid - large screen for this game.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|If you like superhero movies, then you'll enjoy this fun, light action film with an excellent cast. Be sure to wait until the end credits have rolled for a sneak peak at an excellent villain for the sequel (Th****).
0316056871|4.0|Very funny, enjoyed the book a lot.  She has so many interesting storys and such a great way of poking fun at herself.  I would recommend this book to anyone.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|the game itself.is amazing. it just needs some improvement. buying gadgets and them re-buying them gets annoying. if halfbrick fixes that than I'm all up for it. really good. id recomemd this to.my friend if he didn't already have it.
B000006TSC|5.0|Beware Prog snobs: This one might not be for you, but if you like mellow jazz like rock with some amazing guitar work by the one and only Andy Latimer: this one is a gem. Coming after one of Camel's best \\"Rain Dances\\" the musical direction took a little turn to the dark side (Commercial Pop). Peter Bardens didn't like this direction and he parted ways with his longtime partner Latimer after this release. \\"You Make Me Smile\\" is the least progressive song in the set yet it was an honest attempt at a hit. Not one of my favorites but it doesn't make me hit the skip button either. It has a nice middle section that is some great smooth jazz and it saves the tune. It is also probably why it wasn't a hit.<br /><br />Drummer Andy Ward is underrated and his work on this album is nothing short of tremendous. Bass player and vocalist Richard Sinclair adds his jazzy bass style with nice vocals. Journeyman horn player and king of prog woodwinds, Mel Collins adds his many talents as well.\\"Echoes\\" and \\"The Sleeper\\" are both Camel classics and if you don't think this is great music there is no hope for you. All in all this is a great combination of prog and pop and a joy to listen too. 5 stars and a unique entry in the bands legacy. Camel is timeless and their true genius may never be realized. Put your boots on and join them: \\"Down on the Farm.\\"
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have played this on the PC and was so glad to see it for the Kindle. Fire!  I love Match 3 Quest games. Great pass the time away game.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The worst literature ever.<br />Do not permit a youngsrter read rhe book!<br />Irracional literature! Poisons anybody's mind. And SEX should be commitmet and love!!! Grey is a sick bastard!!!!!
B007SSDS24|2.0|Could have been a good movie, but it fell flat! Aliens that you can not see? Even then it could have made it if the ending was better.
B0077XA0W6|5.0|THIS CD IS STILL FRESH AND VIBRANT AS IT WAS IN 1976.  WITH A FEW NEW UNPUBLISHED GOODIES LIKE \\"HARMONY\\" IT STILL SENDS YOU SOARING.  \\"HARMONY\\" SHOULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED AS A SINGLE.  \\"SURRENDER\\" IS ANOTHER CLASSIC I ORDERED THROUGH AMAZON BY DIANA THAT IS EXCITING TO LISTEN TO EVEN TODAY.  I FORGOT HOW GREAT HER VOCALS WERE ON THIS ONE.  A LOT OF SOUL THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE CD.  DIANA DOES NOT RECORD A LOT ANYMORE, SO IT'S NICE TO BE ABLE TO BACK THROUGH HER TERRIFIC EXTENSIVE CATALOGUE AND HEAR SOME OF THE GREAT MUSIC SHE RECORDED DURING HER PHENOMENAL CAREER.
B00846TRHY|5.0|I found this movie very inspiring. It took at least 30 minutes for me to want to watch this movie but then it got much better.
B008SOS63S|4.0|A very nice 2-disk package with many of my favorite Joe Bonamassa songs. He also had a couple guest artists which added a new flavor to his presentation. Glad I purchased.
1401201911|5.0|Elseworlds graphic novels can be hit or miss, but Red Son is definitely a hit. The writing is exceptional, mixing the DC Universe with Cold War realities. Even though we are dealing with comic book superheroes, there is still a \\"this could actually happen\\" feel that kept me engaged from start to finish. Red Son is a definite keeper!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|VERY GOOD MOVIE. THE TYPE WE NEED MORE OF. IT GAVE PRIDE AND HONOR OF AMERICA. IF WE HAD MORE LIKE THIS INSTEAD OF SEX AND DRUGS WE MIGHT HAVE MORE RESPECT FOR ONE ANOTHER.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The continuing story of Gideon  and Eva is incredible! You never know which unpredictable twist is coming next. The 3rd book cant come out soon enough!!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Great album so very glad they keep coming out with great music. The extra song collaboration is especially nice. Plan to listen to this one for a while
B005HSL626|3.0|The game crashes frequently where it goes to a black screen, and I have had to delete it from my Kindle Fire on two or three separate occassions to get it working after a major crash. There could definitely be improvements made.
B008BDZOZY|3.0|Nothing great about this CD. I probably not buy this item. A very disappointing piece of music from David, an artist I admire,
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|To get ready to watch the Walking Dead I make sure all the outside doors are locked.  I have been waiting to watch the first episode of the walking dead all summer.  This episode did not disappoint.  Action packed and sitting on the end of your seat.<br />I especially like the song that was song around the campfire.  Very moving and beautiful.<br />We have dish network which does not offer the AMC channel so had to go to my daughter's house to watch.  Come on Dish<br />sign a contract with AMC so we can watch at home.  I did purchase The Walking Dead thru Amazon.  :). Thank you Amazon.
B008XG1X18|5.0|works great, only problem is it is WAY too convenient!  this is the real app from pinterest.  now they want me to make my review longer
B009GEEMLY|5.0|A fun movie for all ages. What could be better than seeing one of your favorite superheroes from your childhood in a movie? Seeing 7 superheroes in one movie (Captain America, Nick Fury, Hawkeye, Hulk, Iron Man, Black Widow, and Thor). The first 30 minutes or so of this movies could be seen as very boring but once you finish watching it you'll completely forget about that. This is a great movie with great directing, writing, and acting. If you haven't seen this movie already you should definitely add it to your watchlist because this movie is great. Whether you're 5 years old or 100 years old you will enjoy this movie.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|There was never a dull chapter in the book that<br />you wanted to get through with, to get to the next one.<br />  Very descriptive writing and very interesting. The<br /> subject matter is not what alot of people know much<br /> about. I loved this book> could not put it down, then<br /> immediately bought the second and third books!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I read Gillian Flynn's latest novel GONE GIRL and really enjoyed her writing style.  So I purchased her first novel SHARP OBJECTS.  It was totally different in subject matter but just as good.  Her prose is sharp but her characterizations even sharper.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I loved playing this game. I have to admit I have become overly frustrated with other games in this genre. This game is hard enough but what I enjoyed most was the option to skip some puzzles and the ability to use the hint button when needed. It's a great combination of hidden objects, puzzles and a a quest to find clues and objects needed to solve the mystery. I can't wait for part 2.<br />A note to the creators....please keep the skip and hints available....this is the first game I've enjoyed until the very end!!
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I saw this on Netflix and decided it is worth owning a copy, especially in Blue-Ray. Putting the sound on a home theatre system definitely made a difference.
B008BM9L72|3.0|Not madly impressed with the writing style and  found the constant repetition of certain words annoying i.e. smirk. I did enjoy the e-mails exchanged. Am glad I read the books but would not rate them as any literary masterpieces.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|The Bosch series stories are very realistic. Not the running around shooting everybody stuff that some guys put out, but real detective work.It seems that Micheal Connelly has a good handle on police work and proceedures.I sometimes wonder how close to \\"real\\" stories he get to come up with these page turners. I know that I am going to purchase his furture stories for my Kindle,
B004WCTLNY|5.0|This movie really makes you stop and think...could things actually be controlled like this? I thank God we have a Divine Creator and do not have to rely on men to make our choices for us as happens in this movie...don't want to spoil it for others and give it away.  Great acting, great plot, great scenes! A must buy!
B007UR1OHO|5.0|\\"The Vow\\" was a very touching story of a lost love and then gained back. The husband never gave up on his wife.  It was a surprise at the end of the updates on their lives now.  I won't give it away.  Watch the movie.  Very awe inspiring.
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|Not sure I would be able to do what this brave fellow did. A 127 Hours of human survival at it's best!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected in you grabs yor attention from the first page. Gideon goes through great lengths to protect the woman he loves! He will allow nothing or no one to come between them.
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|As a longtime fan of the Percy Jackson series, I like the book very much. what I do not like, however, is the fact that on my kindle fire, it crashes half way through the book. the book itself is amazing, and if the problem is solved, it would receive 5 stars.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|WAS A VERY GOOD MOIVE, I WOULD TELL ANY BODY THAY WANTS TO WATCH A ACTION MOIVE GET THIS ONE...
B008673ZAQ|5.0|All I can say is when is he third one coming out. It was just as incredible as Bared to you. Cannot wait for number three!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a must have app for your kindle. If you have not tried Pinterest join today. you will not be disappointed.
B0085MNZ66|5.0|This game comes with no instructions, which is part of the games charm. after all it is a puzzle game. I play this game daily.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|If you are a fan of Grisham, you will love this book.  It had many twists and turns and kept you guessing until the end.  I plan to read some of Landay's other books.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Far and away the single best super hero movie ever made!  Must see.  Watched it three times in two days.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Well written and enjoyable.  I enjoy the TV show and found the book to be similar.  Moved along well and consisted of interesting plot.
B003K16P50|3.0|The book moved very slowly and had a format that was hard to follow at times. Some of it was very interesting. I now know more about salmon than I needed to know.
034580404X|5.0|These books are not what I thought they would be about....that's for sure! But I loved the story about how Christian & Ana met, fell in love, and all their trials and tribulations. I've read the series twice & plan to read them again.<br /><br />Price of three-book set was not bad. Cheaper then going to Barnes & Nobles!
B003UESJ9M|5.0|Gwyneth Paltrow showcases yet another remarkable talent in her music performances. She is already an acclaimed actress, as we all know, but her additional ability to sing and perform in a music venue adds even more depth to her sensitive portrayal of a troubled young woman yearning for the one thing that tragically slips through her fingers. The supporting cast to this center role shows their strength in music; the acting is good for the roles they perform. This was a touching and nicely done movie that tells a good story about what is really important in life and how easy it can be to lose sight of it.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPCIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EPIC EIPC EPIC EPIC that's is how epic this app is
B002ZG99A4|4.0|This one of those action movies with a who's who's list of action stars. Surely one of the action stars, if not all of them. Is your favorite action star. This one for your collection. And soon you will, as I, have to add Expendables 2 to your/my collection. Now is the time.
1609611543|5.0|I was told about this book by my doctor and I have already seen great results. Easy to read, informative and I would highly recommend it.
B000ICLRIE|4.0|This one I have on dvd but had to have in bluray due to the action throughout the movie. There is also a number of actors and actress you'll recognize. It is a in the time of kings and queens, good and evil. One for your collection.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies as a kid so I ordered it for the 30 year anniversary of the movie.  Movie was in great condition and DVD worked.
B004856SQ8|4.0|After watching on tv for many a years. Mr. T!! To watch the remake or adaption to the big screen. It was good. As many of the tv series are made into big screen movies. This one you will enjoy as well.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I have not read many stephen king books but really enjoyed this particular one. He seemed to cover the bases on what if did happen.<br />Enjoy it
B002VPE1B6|4.0|This is a very good movie. Plenty of action, plenty of well known actors and actress, brilliant colors and the special effects. You will watch over and over. When you want to watch. Don't wait...
B009CPJHY4|3.0|this is a lovely movie with a fantastic cast.. the story is a somewhat confusing, though.. and it is a bit slow at times. still beautiful movie for cozy watching at home on friday night.
B00377V6J2|4.0|If you enjoy the blues, this is one for your collection. Not to mention the two individuals involved in the music video. Two legends of the blues at their best. One the teacher and the other the student, both legends in their own rights. A must for your collection, in this case, cd and dvd.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Flipboard has become one of my 'Daily Drivers': an app I use everyday, all day. It's such an efficient tool for me to be able to stay updated in all the areas I find critical - not just social media. The ability to simply flip through the headlines in one place is priceless. A must have for any info junkie
B001GAPC1K|4.0|If you do not have this one in your collection by now. This you should do as so as possible. In due time, if you like this one, I hear there is a third one coming out to the big screen. Then to dvd/bluray. Add today to your collection. You won't have to play catch-up later.
B005LAII8K|5.0|What a movie this was!! Simply just great science fiction here.<br /><br />Absolutely loved it and will buy it on BD for sure!<br /><br />I thought it was entertaining, action-packed<br />and absorbing. The cast was just great including<br />the boy who I thought was really good and<br />provoking in his possibly first actual<br />role, I believe.<br /><br />I sure hope this will look TERRIFIC in HD! ;-)<br /><br />Go watch it if you haven't already!
B00006FDCD|4.0|For those Stephen King fans. This is one for your collection if you do not already have. IT falls in that category of looking over your shoulders, around corner,etc. You get the ideal. Go two by two even when you watch this movie.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|This is an epic book! I cant wait for the sequel. The best part is the whole entire series (i.e. Percy Jackson and Heroes of Olympus)
B009GEEMLY|5.0|The movie is absolutely awesome definitely one of the better Marvel films I've seen. Oh and did I mention Scarlet? Great flic, must see!!
B007PFD90G|4.0|Although the book is filled with a bit too many names of people who helped Rushdie -- I think this book was in some way a big thank you to his many friends -- I thought it was riveting reading. Rushdie does put the focus where it belongs--on the issue of free speech and censorship, on the right to write whatever you want, even if it is offensive to some. Rushdie is a powerful writer and I would definitely recommend this book.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|While these novels are a bit heavy on the steamy bits, I mean NO ONE can do it that much, I like Sylvia Day's books because while still completely far fetched and fantastical, they almost seem truthful and as if they might really happen to you in a weird way.<br /><br />Also, this book ups the ante by making the relationship between Eva and Gideon seem even more toxic by those around them and others really worry about how they need each other so much and what that can lead to. Others are rightfully concerned when Eva's past comes back to haunt her in more ways than one and Gideon flexes his \\"boyfriendry\\". It gets intense and has twists and turns I really didn't expect, and now I am suffering until December!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Fun game, but a little too slow on coin rewards.  Offline coin rewards should be speeded up somewhat. Rewards do not compare with the several purchases I've made.
B0053O89KG|5.0|The technical quality of the dvd is very good. The content ? Well i knew it : as awesome as i remembered it from the actual tv show.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Its close to the real facebook app.,but it lacks a few things,passable anyway.<br />I cant seem to get the name list that would normaly appear on the right.
1451627297|4.0|This book is outstanding. I wish I could start anew with another one the minute I finished it. I got so totally immersed in the story I lost track of time and place. Good, Good read! Not his usual genre and I almost didn't read it because I don't like his creepy stuff. This book goes onto my Pinterest board as a recommended book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is wonderful! I really enjoyed the first book but this one is even better. I can't put it down.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|As a big fan of both minecraft and lego, I HAD to have this when it came out. The set is, I would say, 'neat'. There really isn't anything we haven't seen in legos before, apart from the steve and creeper bricks. It looks very cool on my desk though, once assembled it is clearly more minecraft than it is lego. The price is a downside however. I was hoping that, for the price, there would be some minecraft specific blocks, such as coal or diamonds. Nonetheless, I did enjoy putting it together and it makes a neat addition to my growing collection of novelty stuff.
B0055D3EFU|3.0|After reading the one-star reviews, I mainly wanted to see the Darth Maul Demon.  It is definitely a Darth Maul demon, which made me smirk.  This movie wasn't scary, but a little suspenseful.  I wouldn't categorize it as \\"horror,\\" more like sci-fi.  I liked the ending.  I didn't mind the movie since I watched it without the intention of being scared.
1400049628|5.0|I highly recommend this book to everyone. Thanks to what I learned from this book, I was able to survive the zombie uprising in my town last year. I was able to relocate myself to the wooded area just outside of town. This area is easily defended. I was also able to stockpile food and weapons for when the zombies came. When, they did, it was no trouble thanks to my superior knowledge of zombie weaknesses. After the worst of the uprising, the few remaining survivors and I took to quarantining and exterminating all the zombies in our town, as the book suggests. The book was very useful, especially when it came to choosing a weapon. It turns out that a homemade flamethrower is NOT a good choice for fighting zombies. I would probably not be writing this review if I hadn't know that before the uprising. We still find the occasional zombie wandering through the woods, but it has literally been months sinc
B0098VYKSA|3.0|The movie would have been better served with a lead who more effectively emotes. Kritian Stewert sadly isn't a fantastic actor. The sets and costume design were amazing.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Yes as many others have said this book is like fifty shades of grey however there is a lot more story behind the characters. I would have to say i enjoyed this one far more then fifty shades
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The first book lures you in with sex and passion. You begin learning the characters and are engulfed in the wild romance. But by book 2 you're looking for the plot to develop. Something drastic and exciting happens and then it's interrupted by 10 pages of sex, leaving you far more excited to just read past it all to find out what just happened.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is a monumental work of scientific research as well as the story of an African-American woman, he ancestors and descendants.  The time-line indicates changes in laws regarding ownership of genes as well as more legal requirements of doctors regarding the use of cells, organs, etc. taken from patients to use in research.  The same time-line shows progress made regarding the rights of African-Americans.  Amazing, to know that the HeLa cells still aid in research after leading to so many break throughs we take for granted such as the polio vaccine.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Easy enough to learn, challenging enough later to enjoy. The perks are fun, and I'm happy that it's not asking for more money for this or that. Replayable.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is good if you want to have a fill in of time. I would like to be able to see more stats tho.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Generally, I like this app.  It's a little slow from time to time, but usually when I close and reopen it, it works fine. Certainly allows me to get my pinterest fix! ;)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|a lot of fun and can be vary addictive. it takes me back when i was a child at the fair.its just a lot of fun
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This was surprisingly good!  It was clever, historical, fantastical, funny and well written: a story about a very old man with a lifetime of experiences, getting out to live even more. Surprises around every turn, yet relatable to so many things the reader has heard about.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I was very hesitant about watching this movie.  I thought it would be the typical comic book fare, but even though that was in the movie, this was more.  I enjoyed the back story and really love how they developed the Captain America character throughout the movie.  They made him noble and caring, which he always has been (based on what my friends have told me about the comic books, er, I mean graphic novels).<br /><br />The movie fits into the setup for the Avengers movie and is just a feel good movie.  Yes, there's a bad guy that does not look like the rest of us, but hey, that's what you expect from a comic series!<br /><br />All I can say is, \\"Sit back and enjoy stepping back in time to simple story and a main character you can enjoy for his idealism.\\"
B007MB5OCE|3.0|Very chatty, and the author apparently does not believe in using quotation marks to denote speech.  There is also little attempt to weave exposition into the story.  Instead the author pretty much lays out the main character's whole childhood and reasons for being the way his is right at the beginning.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|$20 for an e-book, paper version selling for $21???  I don't think so.  Don't encourage these people.  I'll be going to the library if I want to read this one.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|Sort of a history lesson for the last 75 years.....This book just a little bit silly!  I labored to finish the book
B0073COMUW|5.0|Like many people I'm trying to save on electricity. CFL's don't turn on right away - I keep my house cool in the winter - and that's annoying.<br /><br />No problem for this LED bulb. This replaced a 100W incandescent I used as a reading light and it was great with nice bright white light. It wasn't as bright as the 100W but it was at least a bright as a 60W, maybe more. The color of the light is very close to daylight. When I turn it on while it is light outside I get the sense the room is brighter but not the reddish light of incident bulbs.<br /><br />I have heard that daylight balanced lights can help if you have seasonal affective disorder syndrome (SADS). I have not noticed this affecting my mood this fall but I like the daylight white color, though it took a bit of getting used to.<br /><br />I've lived with this bulb for a while now and I'm really pleased. At only 10W power consumption and a VERY long projected life I call it a deal.<br /><br />Update March 2013: I'm still very pleased with the bulb. Incandescent bulbs lose some brightness as they age. It's usually subtle, so if you're not looking for it you probably wouldn't notice.<br /><br />I have two of these LED bulbs. One was unused. Now about 6 months later I can't tell any difference in light between the unused bulb and the one I've used heavily. EXCELLENT!<br /><br />Update July 2013:<br />It keeps getting better. With July heat and humidity anything that warms the things near me is noticable. This LED bulb does not waste energy on heat. It helps keep the room cooler; a double win since I don't have to use extra AC energy to cool things back down. I know this is a trivial amount but it adds up with a house full of lights. As my bed's reading light it's more comfortable to read with it close to my head.<br /><br />Update January 2014:<br />I pulled out my unused bulb (except for comparison) to see how the light compares to my reading light. Over a year and the light is just the same to my eye. An incandescent would have been getting noticeably more red by now in a side-by-side comparison like this. Instant-on is so nice compared to my last in-service CFL (in a hall light). I'm still fully satisfied and I can say the Lighting Ever 10W LED Bulb has exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />I added 2 [[ASIN:B008OBEDSM Lighting EVER 7W A19 LED Bulbs]] to my garage door opener a while ago. Their review (currently on about page 3 of that bulb's reviews) covers their performance and particulars of use in that application. They have been quite good in a high vibration and generally unfriendly environment that used a number of incandescent bulbs before these.<br /><br />Update March 2014:<br />I got a [[ASIN:B008WHBDQI Lighting EVER® 12W bulb 75W equivalent, Warm White]] bulb to replace a failed CFL in that fixture (one of 3 bulbs). This 25W CFL was supposed to be a 60W replacement balanced to match incandescent lighting color. At less than half the power the [[ASIN:B008WHBDQI Lighting EVER® 12W bulb]] was much brighter than the CFL (when working).<br /><br />While I like this bulb that's not the reason for the update. I was reminded that not all LED bulbs are so sensibly and accessibly packaged. I get lighting ever bulbs out of the package without tools. So unlike GE and Sylvania LED bulbs I've purchased recently. Their frustrating packaging did noticeable harm to my usually sunny disposition... So good packaging is another reason why I like Lighting Ever LED bulbs.<br /><br />Update Aug 2014:<br />All my Lighting Ever LED bulbs (garage door opener, hall light, misc. other lights and basement lighting and the original reading light which prompted this review) are all going strong. Not a problem. I pulled out the 2nd of these bulbs I purchased at the same time and compared the light to that virtually unused bulb. The light quality is identical to my eyes. I've never seen this level of consistency from an incandescent.<br /><br />I am still very pleased and happy with my Lighting Ever bulbs. They have been an excellent value for me.<br /><br />Update December 2014:<br />All my Lighting Ever LED bulbs are still performing flawlessly.<br /><br />I've only 9 incandescent bulbs left in my home: 2 150W large globe bulbs above the mirror in my bathroom which have no viable LED replacement, one 40W in my basement stairwell, and 6 (5 recessed and one spot) in my darkroom (remember film photography? :-). The bathroom sees a lot of use for short periods, the basement has less frequent short use and the darkroom is probably under 10h/year in this era of digital photography. As incandescent bulbs burn out I'll replace them with LED bulbs.bulbs are still performing flawlessly.

B0083SBM7Q|2.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I'm not complaining about that.<br /><br />I own a DVD player, but I bought the Blu-Ray/DVD combo because (unlike the solo DVD), it had several extras that I was curious to watch (gag reel, out-takes, alternate beginning, etc.  I didn't realize that the double-set meant that I got the bare-bones DVD and a Blu-Ray (with all the extras) that won't play on my player.  I'm returning it to Amazon and will just buy the regular DVD for less.  I'm seriously irritated that I cannot find these extras in DVD format.  Sorry, Marvel, you burned me on this one.
B0083SBMBM|2.0|Just saw it on DVD for the first time. Don't believe the hype. It is an ok movie and definetly worth a single<br />viewing, but I'm not going to be watching it again any time soon. The pros: the special effects are out of this world,<br />really push the envelope; the action sequences (the few that there are -- thats one of my gripes about the movie, far<br />too much chatting and not enough action) are excellent; Robert Downey Jr is superb as Iron Man -- really one of the great<br />actors of his generation; and Tom Hiddleston is excellent as Loki. Everything else about this movie is just terrible --<br />from a confusing, mess of a story, a forgettable script, and worst of all, other than Loki, generic, boring villains who you<br />don't care about and present zero challenge to the superheros in the story. \\"Wow, look at what Captain America can do with his<br />shield\\" \\"OMG Black Widow is such an amazing martial artist\\" it doesnt mean anything if you are going up against an army of<br />indistinguishable CGI drones. Honestly, if you're look for your Avengers fix go watch Marvel's excellent \\"Avengers: Earth's<br />Mightiest Heroes\\" animated series, and save this one for a boring, rainy Sunday when there is absolutely nothing else to do.
B007HU7NBK|4.0|Its not a dishy tell all but it is an open, honest memoir about how he came to be in one of the biggest bands of the 80s, how he became an addict, and getting sober. It's not a sob story. He realizes how fortunate he has been and what an extraordinary life he has led. I have a new respect and appreciation for the man that was my first big crush.<br /><br />If you are not a Duran Duran fan, I'm not sure you would enjoy this book, however. I think the book needs the context of knowing the band and their music.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|I grew up reading Dr. Suess, so can I say loved the Lorax, it was fun not preachy and tells a good story as only Dr. Suess can do.Four Stars!YAY!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This video was everything I expected and more! The situational comedy involving the super-heroes' personality conflicts was superbly done! The self-sacrifices made by the characters showed us the meaning of super-hero, what it should mean.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I really enjoy these novels. They are a little racy in places so be careful they do not fall into pre teen hands. The clever back and forth between the journalist and the detective, is very well written. For those of you who never read or seen the TV shows. The stories are all based on the ten year old murder of detective Heats mother. This book gets closer to the reasons her mother was murdered stabbed to death in her kitchen. By an unknown personage. If you enjoy the Castle show on t.v. you will love the more true to life version in the books. I can heartily recommend, it for a fun read.
B008N6XB9K|4.0|This is a fun drama. Harvey and Mike are great characters and we enjoyed them in Season 1. Now the battle inside the firm is heating up and there are some great twists and turns. Lots of snappy, smart dialogue too--especially between Mike and Harvey. I like that this is an engaging drama with strong characters but no gore or dead babies. The writing is clever and even laugh-out-loud at times. Good show.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I don't think it holds up to the Potter series but a good read once you delve into it.  Has an interesting twist of characters that keep you engaged.
B009LAP7OE|5.0|Love this show!  Great storylines, costumes, sets, actors, and it's loaded with heart.  This show's got it all, and I highly recommend it.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|Daniel Craig plays Jake Lonergan, a man who one day awakens in the middle of the desert with a bizarre contraption attached to his left arm. After a nasty encounter with some locals (from which he emerges victorious)he wanders into Absolution, a small Western town overseen by Dollarhyde, a war hero turned wealthy land baron played by Action icon Harrison Ford. Jake remembers nothing of his past prior to being in the desert yet one night when mysterious flying alien ships come swooping from the sky and begins abducting various townspeople, Jake and Dollarhyde must join forces, along with others, to battle the extraterrestials and rescue the townsfolk. Good SFX and attention to scenic detail make it a fun ride.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I can not find the link to home when I am using the Android tablet app, although it is easy if I am using the web application version of facebook. The rest is OK.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This was written in Albom's usual method.  It was an interesting way to weave his plot.  The ending was a pleasant surprise.
B009GX6ORA|4.0|I've been a fan of this sitcom and Zooey Deschanel since it began - she can do no wrong.  During its evolution, I found that every episode was headed in a good direction and kept me wanting to watch more. The chemistry between the characters Jess and Nick is unmistakable and encourages the audience to expect their relationship to grow.  I've seen really good sitcoms come and go and really bad ones run forever.  I truly hope this sitcom doesn't become a premature casualty.  The writers need to keep each episode fresh with something new and not head down a stagnant path.  For example, the latest episode, Neighbors, seemed pointless as the cheesy young neighbors came across as pretentious and immature while the main character's goal was to seek their approval for reasons unknown - why would mature professional adults seek the approval of younger wanna-bees? This just made no sense to me and became frustrating.  I just hope future episodes do not include the neighbors or it may lead to the demise of this sitcom.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I have been a Patricia Cornwell fan for many years, and have purchased all of her books. This is one of three that I wish she had not written.<br /><br />  \\"The Bone Bed\\" was very difficult to get into, but I had hopes it would get better. For me, it did't. I wanted more story line and less technical descriptions. Too many pages filled with all the details of the job. I found myself paging through to try and get to the story and towards the end of the book, I was skipping almost entire chapters. Sorry I wasted my money and sorry the author seems to have run out of readable story material.<br /><br />  May not purchase another Patricia Cornwell book without sampling first.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you liked 50 Shades series then you must read this book!! I couldnt put it down, just like 50 Shades, I had to keep reading to find out what happens next.
B007THA4FI|1.0|This whole book, \\"The Casual Vacancy\\", purchased from Amazon, was boring to me. Too many in's and out's of situations, very hard to follow without going back pages trying to recapture each situation. I do not recommend this book. Sorry.
B002PZ1H6E|5.0|This movie gave a whole new appreciation to Beatrice Potter's great talent. I have always loved her books...now I love hem more!
B007THA4FI|1.0|I love to read books where the characters are three dimensional people that you would recognize on the street.  Sadly this book is not one of them.  The writing is flat, unimaginative and boring.  If you must read it, borrow it from the library.  I felt it was a waste of the money.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|It is not a good game after a certain time of playing then it tries to make you buy the full version and if you don't it doesn't let you play anymore
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Really fun game. Lots of twists and turns. Good story. Would definitely recommend. Looking forward to game to being released!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected picks up from Bared and you really must read Bared first.  I was captivated immediately with Eva and Gideon. I have long been a fan of Sylvia Day and her two Crossfire novels have only increase my fandom.  Plus, I do appreciate gritty romance with dark erotic elements.<br />I liked Eva. No I loved Eva because she loves her man in spite of what her head and friends tell her. Yeap she is honest as a flaw to herself and her shortcomings with Gideon. And while Gideon does some crappy things that most women in real life would not put up with, not at any time does her reactions make her a TSTL heroine. And she does stand up for herself and take command and puts Gideon on alert when he has gone too far.  I loved Gideon because hardcore possessive alpha hypersexual males with wounded souls are what I enjoy reading. Gideon fits it all.  Plus I am a fan of  toxic addictive relationships that end that ultimately have a HEA.<br /><br />As expected we learn actually get details on Gideon's past from Gideon. We also drawn into Gideon attempt to protect Eva from her past demons at the expense of her sanity, her love of him and the loss of their relationship.  Eva also continues her quest to find who hurt Gideon and stirs up a proverbial hornet's nest. I also enjoyed Eva's blast from the past who wants a future. Can't wait to see how that shakes out.<br /><br />The sex. I do suggest a glass of cold water or a partner. Gritty. Hot. Dirty. Controlling. I don't think I can ever look at a limo again and not recall what took place in their fictional world.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I purchased this app but it wouldn't let me download for some odd reason!!!<br />I love minecraft!<br />Once it works for my kindle Fire...<br />I will be happy!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|While I thought Fifty was horrendous, it has given authors who REALLY know how write erotica/romance/BDSM some props and recognition that they otherwise would not have.
034580404X|5.0|Very good! It's a love story and very entertaining and educational about the Dom/Sub world. I would recommend it to other adults. I look forward to more from this Author.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you like the 80's, gaming, computers, or a tale involving all of the above, you will love this book.
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|Field of dreams is a classic Baseball movie. It is a must have for any movie collector. I know many people who love this movie and don't care about Baseball! Can you believe that there are folks that don't love Baseball?
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Simply one of the best new bands out there.  Along with fun. and Of Monsters and Men part of the great wave of new and talented musicians.  I loved every song from beginning to end on both of their albums.  Can not give this any higher rating or recommendation.  [[ASIN:B009A3NGF4 Babel (Deluxe Edition)]]
B0097NGUJG|5.0|Really, REALLY loving this album. I can't get it out of rotation in my car. It is so beautiful and so different that it fascinates me. Poetic and dramatic, subtle and charming, to sad and raw, sexy and brutal... It's emotional notes will take your ears on a journey. I HIGHLY recommend listening to this album with headphones, loud and with no distractions. It should be listed in everyone's top 10 for 2012, but sadly won't get mainstream play. New fan here, and already thirsty for more form these guys.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. The all star British cast pretty much guaranteed a hit, but it was even better than I expected. Scenery was beautiful and the music divine, perfect picture of India. Though this movie is more for the older person, I think younger people would enjoy it, even if only for the impeccable performances by all the actors. This is a marvelous movie.
B002RHGYOA|4.0|The second book in this trilogy was as (if not more) exciting and riveting than the first book.  I have now completed the third book and would love the series to go on.
B008S80P38|5.0|I love the layout. it makes worth of buying the CD instead of getting it on iTunes. Love the songs huge deadmau5 fan.  Its a must have.

B008FPOIT6|5.0|While, I have not finished reading this book yet, it has the elements of things I like to read about. Old world books and new techie e-books. Old people meet young people. I love this book.

B000ANVPPQ|5.0|This is a fun movie for fans of John Wayne. Maureen O'Hara puts in a great performance as his headstrong wife. A humorous movie that you will enjoy.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|We've watched it multiple times. The sequel was great as well.  Lots of action.  Good characters. What more is there to say?
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I enjoy playing this with my 5-year-old grandchild.  We have fun playing while his brother takes a nap.  My husband caught me playing it after the kids had left.  I explained I was trying to stay competitive.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|For a book I thought would never end I was really kind of sad when it did.  Not that I enjoyed it as much as the first three in the series but because I was hoping before it ended that it would have taken me somewhere I wanted to go with the story but sadly it never did and now I need to push on to the other half of the book which is book number five.  So hoping book five is more fulfilling than this book but I have read reviews that tell me it's pretty much just a continuation of the same filler type of information that would serve better in a glossary at the end of the book.  But I'm<br /> invested in the series and will just have to push through until we somehow come to a logical conclusion to this series before I totally lose interest in it.
B008A1TIOK|5.0|This is an absolute delight! If you have an open mind and realize that this is, and is supposed to be, entirely different composition than the original Four Seasons you will not be disappointed. Yes, one can pick out a hint of the original masterpiece here and there, but this piece can and does stand on it's own.  I buy a lot of music and I will not write a review because so much of this is a matter of taste.  But  I think this piece deserves a listen.
B009KHBDUU|4.0|Funny modern spin off dark shadows soap opera and twilight. Depp is hilarious. Great cast. Movie turned out a little artsy, but I like it. I recommend it if you want a spooky October comedy.
1878424114|5.0|This book is one of the really \\"deep\\" leadership books that really inspires you to do something great. The language is so uplifting, examples so poignant, that you wondered why you ever thought about leadership in any other way. It's not the kind of book you get business strategies from (although you can develop strategies from it), but more of a \\"principles\\" book. If you are looking for something to help you make leadership decisions, I would highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Pros<br />1. Simple concepts-The content of the book does not focus on traditional \\"leadership\\" topics like, \\"How to Outperform Your Competitor\\"; instead it focuses on the principles behind leadership. I found this to create a deeper and more memorable lesson than some other leadership books which focus on creating cute or complicated marketing names. I have found this to be true in many of the books I enjoy like [[ASIN:B008QQ9V6O Attitude - Your Best hope for Happiness (A look at the men who founded the Positive Attitude Movement)]], [[ASIN:B007KBR5N2 Making Your Life Work: How to Make Money in any Economy: How to Create a Rewarding Life (Creating Lifestyle)]] and[[ASIN:0470627603 The 10X Rule: The Only Difference Between Success and Failure]]<br /><br />2. Unique Applications-At the end of each chapter, the book focuses on applications that are unique, fun, and easy to implement. They are not your typical practical exercises, which I think makes them more fun.<br /><br />Cons<br />1. There really are no negatives I can associate with this book. I am a fan of most of Deepak Chopra's work and i consider this to be an excellent book! The only thing I would caution, though, is that you must be open to spiritual concepts (particularly Eastern) in order to read it. If you are not, this book will seem  too abstract for you. This is a book on how to be a leader in all areas of life, not just in business, which it is typically associated with.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I think  its a great  app for it gives  one access  to many  types of  radio  stations of  all types-music-talk-news- etc.<br /><br />Also  have access  to other  types  of  audio like public  safety  radio  and from podcasts.
0316212377|3.0|I'm a big fan of Iain M. Banks and have greatly enjoyed everything he has written -  until this one. It's a very difficult read and hard to sort out the various characters, both organic and machine, and what is really going on. Nevertheless, it is a Culture yarn and deserves a shot just because of that.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Another animation I rented from Amazon. Cute animation as well as story. My Boyfriend is the one who wanted to watch this. It was better than I thought.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I loved this read.  It is written so that the \\"military-challenged\\" minded can get it!  I highly recommend this book!
B006P0FD4W|3.0|I'm reviewing the regular 1hr 24min, which I viewed through Netflix Streaming (available as of 10/21/12). The movie is a prequel to the original Paranormal Activity and follows Katie, Kristi and their parents back in 1988.<br /><br />This film is basically the same as the first 2 since it follows the same formula: weird things happen, father/husband sets up camera(s), sleeping and more strange things happen, and a frantic ending occurs. If you're not tired of this structure yet, then this may not bother you at all but, it's also a bit predictable. The scares were decent, I felt like this one used more jump-out scares, though. I did enjoy the Bloody Mary sequence with Randy and Katie, though; especially when the furniture is thrown and only Toby's chair is in it's place. One problem with these films and this may only be me, but sometimes during the long shots of them sleeping or doing everyday activities, my eyes are always wandering as I tried to figure out what I'm supposed to be looking at. I'm a fan of supernatural horror, so I found the film to be entertaining, nonetheless, but it's really nothing special.<br /><br />Paranormal Activity 3 is more of the same. If you're not a fan of the series or found footage films in general, then you're probably better off avoiding this. I heard the extended version is a lot better, so I look forward to watching that when I get the chance.<br /><br />Paranormal Activity 3 has some blood and violence, no sex or nudity.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book was fantastic. A page turner you want to forget about the rest of life to complete. Unforgettable story and characters...don't miss this one.
B008MEM24S|5.0|my kid loves this game and I gotta admit its pretty addictive! just wish there were other obstacles like card match up or word scramble type stuff
B0060D0IYY|5.0|Admittedly a little syrupy at times, but very stimulating intellectually and emotionally. Everyone who is different from the norm can probably appreciate this film. An ending that actually makes sense.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|there is not a bad song on this album. i have listened to it no less than 10 times in 2 days. i heard \\"love song\\" on the radio and loved it, but for some reason never searched for other music by her. then i heard other cuts from this album played on pandora radio and i thought they were incredible, so i bought the album. then i was asking myself \\"hey, dummy, what took you so long?\\"<br />just perfect perfect perfect. highly recommended.

B004V9MU86|4.0|How do you plan on meeting Death? With a fire burning in your eyes? Meekly, like a lost child? Did you plan to give him a punch in the eye?<br /><br />Markus Zusak takes us on a journey with an unlikely storyteller - Death. Not your skeletal faced, scythe-wielding Death either, in fact, in his own words:<br /><br />\\"A SMALL PIECE OF TRUTH<br />I do not carry a sickle or scythe.<br />I only wear a hooded black robe when it's cold.<br />And I don't have those skull-like facial features you seem to enjoy pinning on me from a distance. You want to know what I truly look like? I'll help you out. Find yourself a mirror while I continue.\\"<br /><br />I'd never read a story like this before, and chances are, I won't again. I'd heard a lot of very positive things, which quite possibly gave it a bit of a disadvantage, if I'd not been pre-warned the story may have been more emotional, more exciting, just MORE. Sadly, because of this pre-warning, I went into it with my eyes open, hoping, no, expecting to be impressed and blown away with the story.  I was... but not as much as I had hoped.<br /><br />Leisel, henceforth referred to as The Book Thief, failed to worm her way into my heart and set up shop there completely. I felt connected to her; I mean she loved books and words... I wouldn't be writing this, nor read the book if I too didn't share that passion, but I think this is where the connection ended. That is not to say that Markus' writing style left me wanting in the emotional stakes... oh no! I will share more with you shortly.<br /><br />If at first you feel a little distanced from the characters, or indeed the entire story as I found myself, persevere! I think the issue is the 'outside looking in' feel you get from the re-telling style of narration. This is something you must grow accustomed to slowly, immersing yourself, ever so slowly into the frigid waters that are Death's musings and memories.<br /><br />By half way through the book, the distance I felt had dissipated. I was bound to this book. Tethered so completely I felt like sleeping with my kindle. The story began to haunt my dreams and pervade my mind while I was awake. I saw flecks of Leisel, Hans, Rosa and Rudy in people of my everyday life. A familiar silver eye; a cardboard-faced, wardrobe-shaped woman; a small girl darting through a crowd. I knew then, that this book would be a problem.<br /><br />I'd been pre-warned about the ending... nothing specific mind you, but it was enough. Really this book shouldn't need a warning, the story is about the holocaust, we all know how that ended, but rather surprisingly it still did. It was a very apt warning too, and as it turns out, I needed it.<br /><br />At 11:30pm on October 18th 2012 I lay in bed with tears streaking down my face and a guttural sadness gripping my heart as I switched off my kindle. I felt as if my best friend had died. That's horrible isn't it! But it doesn't change the fact that it's the truth.<br /><br />Be prepared people, be warned! This book may do more than just steal a few hours/days/weeks of your life. It may also implant a strong sense of sadness and loss at the end. Be prepared to be awed, to be inspired and then thoroughly gutted. Markus has a truly poetic writing style that so completely shows you, not only what is happening, but also the fullness of the emotions and feelings involved.<br /><br />Be prepared for an emotional raping with this book!<br /><br />Be prepared to find out:  \\"Even death has a heart.\\"ed.

B0013O123Q|1.0|Motion pictures have a difficult time making comment on or revealing an anti-social or anti-life theme without crossing over into the sphere on which they are trying to make comment. Its unfortunate that the brutality that Irreversible depicts actually exists in the world. I am of the opinion that even staged violence in someway violates the people who are watching the film. This film proves this as well as the truth of its title. The violence doesn't stop no matter which direction in time we are moving. There are many forms of violence in this film besides the horrific physical violence it depicts. There is the sex trade, indifference to one's friends, the ongoing berating and shouting between most of the characters. Within the genre of documentary film making there is a principle that views the very act of making the recordings as a kind of rape. The semi documentary feel of Irreversible brings this sense of constant violation home to anyone who sees this film. I feel that the outcome of viewing this film is that I realize yet again that there is a very thin veil that separates the apparent peace and ease of our lives from the most heinous acts of which human beings are capable. The difficulty we all face is that, like the protagonist in this film, there is nothing really to be done about any of it in retrospect. We can only escape the violence of the world by averting the circumstances that allow it before it happens.
B000S5BUXI|4.0|I dragged my feet for a while before finally picking this record up. I have yet to be disappointed. Enjoy!
0316228532|3.0|I've read enough British books about class with multiple POVs to feel I can say while Rowling does a good job balancing the characters, ultimately I didn't feel like there was anything really new here.  If you want to read about a similar topic, but Ina more original manner, read Zadie Smith's WHITE TEETH.<br /><br />Again, it's not that this is a bad novel, just that I wasn't blown away by it.  The beginning is a bit slow, but really picks up, only to have a slightly disappointing ending (in my opinion).  I think my biggest issue is that we end following a minor POV in the last pages, and all I could think was: \\"But what are the other characters feeling and doing?\\"<br /><br />Hence: 3 stars
B007THA4FI|1.0|I thought any author who could hold the attention of a middle school reader for 600 pages would write a mesmerizing adult book.  In this case the \\"adult\\" designation just meant as in X rated.
B001DDBCUA|5.0|Since I love the show, I liked the movie a lot. Great actors and different things from the show. I guess it was a good idea to make this film. I wish one like this of Desperate housewives...!
B002ZTIIXK|1.0|Songs are really draggy. Most are obscure, never released songs that would never sell on their own.  If this had offered a preview of the songs on the CD before purchase, I would never have bought it. I am a fan of Ms. Langs voice, not her lifestyle, and her lifestyle is what she seems to be promoting with the songs on this set.
B00007AJF8|5.0|Great, different and unique movie. Very interesting and full of sorprises. I was so brave from the writer, producers, etc. to make this movie, because it could be something totally silly or great. And the result was beyond that: AWESOME !
B000FCKGPC|4.0|A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons both cover the same period of time in Martin's saga. They are a bridge between the setup (the first three books) and the conclusion (the last two books) in the series. A Feast for Crows was a fast and an enjoyable read. Like the rest of the books in the series (and the HBO production for that matter) it leaves you wanting more. It is not a standalone novel, but for those of us who are enjoying the series it is a must read.
B006VJMZXY|5.0|Have read all the previous books that link to the saga of this century.  Each time I think this must be the end of varying angles that Phillipa Greogry finds, she some how finds another.  The books tell the story so well that you would be forgiven to thinking that its actual history.  I can't wait for the next one.

B006LSZECO|3.0|Disappointing because of the hype about who the writer was.  I'm a male and I still blushed at some of the detail and the words used.  Call me prudish if you want, but I don't personally like to read about things I don't even discuss with others.<br /><br />Outstanding in other ways though.  It kept me guessing.  I was for one character for awhile and then suddenly changed my mind as the story went along.  It was surprising to read the ending.  Couldn't believe the ending because it wasn't supposed to end that way.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I'm not going to go into details of the movie that have been commented on many, many times here but just the 3D disc itself and I can't say enough about it. I felt it was done remarkably well. It wasn't overused to be totally distracting or disjointed but carefully enough to give the depth  as needed. A couple days after watching the 3D version I went back and watched the Blu-ray disc - I was so enthralled by the 3D version that I let myself become too absorbed in some of the effects to concentrate on the movie and had to watch the Blu-ray version to view the movie. This was not the fault of the movie, prooducers or so on, this was the first 3D movie I got and viewed on my new 3D TV so it was an entirely new experience for me and I got lost in paying more attention to the effects than concentrating on the program.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Really found the characters in the book unlikable. And I didn't feel the book was resolved in a positive manner. No one seemed to learn and grow from the events unfolding in the book. Finished the novel feeling unsatisfied. I will not be purchasing another one of J.K. Rowling's books.
B005LAIHPY|1.0|I struggled to get about half way thru this before stopping it and taking it out. It's a good idea about aliens responding to our signals then invading the Earth. Too bad they didn't use competent actors, more realistic characters and dialogue, as well as character development (come on, a 20 ish unemployed, loser, alcoholic bum all of a sudden a US Navy Lieutenant with 3 rows of ribbons in charge of the Weapons system on board a DDG) Nahhh!! Very poor movie. If you want my Blu-ray copy with the extras disc, etc and are willing to pay the postage I'll be glad to send it to you. Otherwise it's down to the pawn shop to see how much - if anything - they are willing to give me. I think I can get at least $1, and would be happy with that.
B001MKQS4O|5.0|I almost never watch modern films...they bore me. They insult me. The staff of millions required to create them, assumes I am a dingdong (I guess...), as nothing is left undone or unsaid. This film is entirely different...i was fastened to my chair like a tick on the plump butt of a big heifer...I read everything Capote wrote & I do this yearly, because it is so damned great. I find the classics (Other Voices, Grass Harp etc..) as being the finest literature ever birthed on American soil...(but, let me add Ross Lockridge's Raintree County to that statement...). Whatever, the case...one wonders about Capote, his southern bent....his descent into what became his isolationist demise into what were his only solace in the end (drugs & booze)...perhaps it was In Cold Blood that broke him. I hesitated to watch this film because Capote is, despite his flaws, a sacred object to me...yet, I could not resist the movie in the end! The acting was so steeped in what certainly must be Truman Capote,spectacularly! I also loved the actress who portrayed the calm and anchored, Harper Lee. Really, all fans of classic American literature should watch this attempt to capture the essence of Truman Capote without the effect of resultant caricature. It was done here.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Great series for any sci-fi fan. Uses an amazing blend of western and sci-fi to create its own genre. Too bad they only made one season
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great read  ive never read a book this quickly    i could not put it down!  I cant wait to see what happens next!
B007THA4FI|3.0|Well written but a snoozer.  The characters are interesting but there's no twists and turns, I'm about half way through and hoping the plot thickens

B0071XO8RA|5.0|It really is as good as its review profile suggests. It starts well, gets better, and ends beautifully. I have almost no complaints.
B008ACC9CM|1.0|Having heard Jonathan sing on Britain's Got Talent, I basically bought the cd to hear HIM sing again.  What a disapppointment.  His voice is not given enough space: he's either drowned out by the background music and/or Charlotte, or he sounds as if he's singing a mile away from the microphone.  The whole thing, which should have been a dramatic performance has been reduced to elevator music, or at best cruise ship entertainment.  He deserves better.  Simon Cowell was right - he should go solo.
B009AMALLM|1.0|They dropped the ball on this one and left a bad taste in my mouth marking, perhaps, an end to this otherwise well-done franchise.  Not scary.  Not creepy.  Not good.<br /><br />I loved Paranormal Activity (2008), perhaps enjoyed Paranormal Activity 2 (2010) even more, and, despite being my least favorite, I even liked Paranormal Activity 3 (2011).  These three movies set the same stage with the same types of slow-building creepy scares while obscurely adding detail to the origin of their poltergeist.<br /><br />This fourth installment has the same directors as Paranormal Activity 3 (2011), but they seemed to have strayed from the formula that worked so well in the previous films.  For example, parts one to three open by introducing us to young couples and families that are likable, and they did this well so that we viewers would actually give a damn when bad things start happening to these characters.  They're always some variant of an American family portrait and it's easy for us to identify with them.  Part four begins by introducing us to Alex, a young teen, and her sort of annoying boyfriend.  Contrary to the prequels she is just handed to us and no effort is made to show her finer qualities or her relationship with her parents.  In fact, the parents are more implied than presented until later in the movie, when they become more integral to the story.  We don't even get the notion that the parents have a happy marriage as our victems did in Poltergeist or the earlier Paranormal Activity films.  As a result, we don't know much about them and feel indifferent about their haunting.<br /><br />Alex is meant to be a protagonist much as the daughter was in Paranormal Activity 2.  She does the things a protagonist does, but I never bought it.  Her character was ineffective.  As the story progresses and her parents begin to experience the haunting, we are just then starting to learn about them.  Oh, and the franchise story seems to be getting obscured rather than developed in this fourth film which was, for lack of a better word, annoying.<br /><br />Alex's family takes in their neighbor's (Katie Featherson; Paranormal Activity, Paranormal Activity 2, Paranormal Activity 3) young son Robbie after she goes to the hospital sick.  After taking in this quirky child and his invisible friend, some strange things start happening.  We don't know what Katie was doing between her disappearance (at the end of Paranormal Activity 2) and this movie.  She's just dropped in our lap and we have to just deal with it.  Robbie paints a color-by-numbers witchcraft symbol on Wyatt (Alex's little brother) which evidently indicates that he is to be possessed during some ritual.  Alluding to the end of part 3, this concept is hardly followed up.  Toby, Robbie's invisible friend-poltergeist, is a mixed bag in this film.  The first two films seemed more like \\"house\\" movies in which \\"things were simply happening to people\\" as a result of \\"something.\\"  Part three presented a poltergeist, a specific entity, which was actively \\"doing things to people.\\"  In part four, we get a little of both, demonstrative of poor writing and rendering our ghost less credible.  The \\"things\\" that happen to Alex's family are less frequent, less scary and less interesting by far than in the other films.<br /><br />For whatever reason, the directors also used fewer subtle \\"did you see that?\\" moments when something moves or changes and if you blink you'd miss it.  Those moments were exciting in the earlier films.  All we get in this one is two moving objects, a broken chandelier and some swaying doors.  This movie actually felt boring compared to the rest of this engaging franchise.  Even the meant-to-be-shocking ending was a big ho-hum disappointment.<br /><br />Even if you're a fan of the franchise, you should probably just skip this.oped in this fourth film which was, for lack of a better word, annoying.<br /><br />Alex's family takes in their neighbor's (Katie Featherson; Paranormal Activity, Paranormal Activity 2, Paranormal Activity 3) young son Robbie after she goes to the hospital sick.

B007THA4FI|1.0|It was a downer.  My husband finished the book, also thought the same thing.  I didn't finish the book.  Would<br />never have bought it if it wasn't by jk Rowling.  Very unusal for me not to finish a book.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I was a bit disappointed in book two of the Century Trilogy. The first book kept me enthralled versus the second being just okay.  It was good enough that I would of bought it anyway knowing this since its so hard to find good historical books and anything longer than 350 pages.  But, this was not Ken F. at his best.  It could be that I know too much about this time in history and it was redundant, but it would seem from past books he could of made his characters more interesting.  I've read every book Ken Follett has written and noticed that most are wonderful but interspersed with some average works.
B007THA4FI|1.0|She should stick to writing childrens books. I did not like the book at all.Too wordy With a lot of swearing to try and make it an adult book.Bad characters and a weak plot.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I enjoy it as mindless pleasure ... I am not tech savvy or good at strategy but I love the fun in matching and the great time it passes!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I loved this game and so does my brother if I could make more than one review I definitely would
B009KHBDUU|1.0|Started off ok but just made no sense. Wasted use of Michelle Pfiefer (who basically disappears), Helena Bonham Carter, and Johnny Depp for that matter. This was a fun premise with which they could of done a zillion things - even something formulaic -- but I think the writers lost interest and just let it become a dud.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I couldnt put it down. Whens the next one coming out? Cured my empty space from finishing fifty shades of grey
B0083P1QUM|3.0|The Kindle version of this book is flawed. From the first page, the reader is taken to an obviously out-of-place paragraph, making reading difficult at the onset. I have come to expect better editing from both Kindle and the publisher.
B003R50AW8|5.0|Not your usual novel, so if you expect a conventional story you should think again, but great use of language and in the end a wonderful look at human behaviour. The characters are all painfully ordinary, but you become involved with them in a way that is missing in many grander novels. I especially love The Doorman.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I am sure if I lived in uk I would get it. it reads like a standard english mystery novel so I keep waiting for someone to show up dead under mysterious circumstances but that never happens. could not finish the book and I HATE to leave books unfinished.
B003PPDBQ2|4.0|Having a sister myself, I thought this was a novel I should read, and I wasn't disappointed.  A fast paced, easy read with believable characters and a great story line, it kept me entertained to the very end.

B007EECSFA|5.0|This is I can't put this book down kind of book!  It has history, love, mystery all combined, and characters that seem so real!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I really like three match type games but do get a little tired of them too. This game throws in a little hidden picture plus a story in with the match 3 game. The graphics are very nice. All around I have been entertained for days and complely engrossed.  If only it could do my laundry :)  I would recommend this for all ages except young  kids. It is even entertaining for non-gamers. Works great on kindle fire.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I guess no one could keep the Harry Potter interest going.  This book did not grab me, and hold my interest.  It was ok, but I guess I expected more from J.K. Rowling.
0307730697|5.0|I finished the book this morning and couldn't help but be moved to tears. Adam Brown is a true American hero. Highly recommend.
B002APU580|5.0|This is such a great film! The mother can wear you out, but that is the purpose of the mute button on your remote. I have watched it so many times on TV, however I have only seen the complete movie with a great ending once or twice, TV usually stops with the father saying any other courters are free to come in. That is why I purchased it and I also purchased a copy for my friend for her to enjoy.  I think this is one of her best movies and you see how beautiful she really is. The entire cast is very good in their given roles.
B008G8SFGO|1.0|I am deeply sorry people, but this album is so incredibly lame from the first track to the last. i can only assume that all the positive reviews have been from people that Gene has paid or people that don't know any better and have never escaped the 80s. i have always been a huge kiss fan ever since i was 10 years old and have always loved the music no matter what, the truth of the matter is Kiss haven't done anything musically noteworthy since the album Revenge. the tunes, lyrics and overall feel of this album is total cheese and more than a little bit embarrassing to all of the people in the world that claim themselves as Kiss fans. my rating of 1 star is purely for Eric and Thommy being allowed to have a go at owning a song or two. i wouldn't even steal this album let alone pay my hard earned money for it. in fact i would rather pay for a Vinnie Vincent album over this drivel.
B007RQ6WCA|1.0|I got this because I thought it would be an answer to my lack of Dropbox access on my kindle fire hd. It is not. I finally gave up, and just slideloaded the Dropbox apk off of another of my android devices. That worked like a charm.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I cant understand why people would give it low ratings. comparatively this makes me interract with it more than minecraft. The mobs are beautifully done. The night and day sky are magnificent. The quests are tedious but not to unreasonable. This game makes me laugh with its jokes. For 5$ its worth the price so I'm going to be buying it soon. I think any true gamer would buy it... sure the controls are a bit different at first but you get used to them. c:

B0058YPL66|4.0|I remember being really excited for this show before it started airing. I've always loved fairytales, and this show seemed like it would be right up my alley. When it actually started airing on tv I saw the first two episodes and ended up actually being somewhat disappointed. The show had failed to hook my interest from the beginning, so I stopped watching.<br /><br />It wasn't until the show came out on DVD that I decided to give it another chance. I still found myself uninterested and disappointed in the first two episodes, but I stuck with it. With each episode I found myself getting more and more into the show. I think as the show went on it got a little better with each episode.<br /><br />Personally, I think Mr Gold/Rumpelstiltskin steals the show. I find his character the most interesting and the most fleshed out. The episodes that center around him are definitely some of my favorites.<br /><br />As I said before, I think the further you get into the show the better it gets. I think the Huntsman episode is where I really got hooked. I like that fact that they give us back stories for familiar characters. Specifically, I loved how they went about showing how Rumpelstiltskin and Regina came to be they way they are. So often the villains are evil only because the story needs an antagonist, but the fact that the writers went to the trouble of showing us their pasts actually makes the audience understand how they came to be the people they are and even feel for them.<br /><br />The reason I'm giving this show four stars instead of five is because I feel the first couple of episodes were lacking something that should have really had me hooked from the very beginning. Despite that, overall I ended up really enjoying the show and will probably watch it many times.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|So great. Characters are endearing and the story is incredibly well written. Love this series. It's a page turner and as far as hot romances go this one is the best!
B004ZH66XO|5.0|I love this game! My only concern is that I'm upgrading my phone and it is showing I have top r purchase this game to download it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Great book...the book club chose it so I had to read it :).  I read the first few chapters to get the jist of the book and ordered it immediately.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Was looking forward to the release, but disappointed in the book. Started reading while on vacation but could not hold my interest. Very sad and dis-functional family sort of thing. Big disappointment.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|need more coins..<br />love the game please work on being able to get more free coins thank you<br />peggy smith
B007THA4FI|1.0|After a few pages I started writing down the names and what they did to help keep track of the story line.  I was very disappointed in the story.  I read approximately 60 pages and gave up.  The story just did not grab me.

B008OJ291W|4.0|This album impressed me but also shows why Jeff Lynne is one of the truly talented writers, musicians & producers of our time. It is almost like listening to tracks by ELO that need a few finishing touches. I read the negative comments and only can say \\"take a chill pill\\", I mean come on, I knew this was in the works for sometime, some of these tracks were even used in US commercials already & they would see the light of day sooner or later. So all you negative reviewers out there, it is exactly as Jeff wanted to do for some time. The only real reason it did not get a 5 star rating from me is that the cover clearly says \\"ELO\\" as the artist and this was a Jeff Lynne project. Watch the documentary on him called Mr Blue Sky: The Jeff Lynne Story on Biography or the BBC radio special on his career. As a collector it is nice to here the re-worked tracks. Might have been nice to hear Jeff dust off \\"Beatles Forever\\" (my ELO version in my collection could have been a nice comparison) but guess he wanted to use released material only. So check out the album if your fan and figure the hardcore collector has no doubts about this one & has already enjoyed it.<br />Drop by my site sometime @ \\"JudeMac Forever\\" & take a tour, I bark a lot but don't bite ;-).
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I wish they had more special features on DVDs still, but if all you want is the movie, get this! (It does have a couple of special features, though.)
B008Y5OW20|5.0|Ok, this is a superb album that Jeff has wanted to do for years. So anyone who wants to do further reviews on this album, do me a favor, research the album before buying it & then trashing it!(saying, it ain't ELO, it don't sound like the Wilbury's comments) With that said, another example of a artist going back and covering songs that always inspired them. All the information could be seen on the TV special on his life or the radio BBC podcast on his life. Jeff played most all the instruments on this album in the same way John Fogerty did on his \\"Centerfield\\" album. I can see why he did a project like this because I grew up in that era as well. There are some touching tracks on this one including \\"Beyond The Sea\\" which was one of my favorites originally by Bobby Darren. I recommend it for those fans who have been with Jeff since he was with \\"The Nightriders\\", Idle Race,The Move & ELO.<br />Drop by my website sometime @ \\"JudeMac Forever\\" for a visit & buy this album.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|A great match 3 game. You actually have an objective and it isn't always easy to obtain. Good graphics and great music. I hope more come out soon like this.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|To be honest, I first saw this movie when i was at the gym. I was blown away at how good it was. Liam Nesson's performance was top notch along with the fact that all the action made sense to the average eye. There was no over the top effects and just overall the movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I highly recommend this movie to anyone of any age.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I enjoyed this book even more than the first in the Trilogy.<br />I am looking forward to the third book

1401322786|5.0|You can easily fininsh this book in two readings.  Time is the most important possession we have since you can not store it away for another day. Life can not be endless because we then never appreciate loss and sacrifice.  Gives the reader a bit a different slant on how to view ones life.  No one knows what the future holds for any of us, so be careful what you wish for.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|love this game. no problems at all. runs smooth on my android tablet. would highly recommend!!  great graphics.  hours of fun for all ages.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Played the whole way through and never got bored. Best free game I ever downloaded! Play never gets old and there are so many levels.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The first 2 books of this trilogy were a bit childish in places..But it gave a person insight to a world that most of us know little about..The third book was the best of the 3..Or so I thought..not many liked it from the reviews but it had a nice ending..
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Wonderful story  A bit difficult to get into at first, but after a couple of chapters it was easier to read the old English.  Lots of craziness.
B007UZO3F6|4.0|I've had about 6 Shuttle computers, now. I was using this miniature form long before any of my associates or family knew about them. I like them so much, I even use one at work. But there have been some disturbing results, the last few years.<br /><br />I've had two previous Shuttles develop motherboard issues, and when my latest one (about 3 years old) started acting whacky, I quickly backed everything up and started troubleshooting. Power Supply and all the different add-ons tested fine. It was yet another bad Shuttle motherboard. That makes 3 out of 6 -- not good news.<br /><br />So I really hesitated on buying the Z77R5. Only time will tell if I made the right decision, but part of my reason was I needed to get up and running quickly -- and I know my way around the Shuttle design. I did a lot of research and weighed the Pros and Cons -- and here are my observations...<br /><br />1) The box is not any more-cheaply made than any of the previous Shuttles. They have never been cast iron. The covers have always been adequate -- as is this one. This one has the added benefit of a brushed finish which helps hide fingerprints.<br /><br />2) I do not like the cable layout and routing schemes on this design. There are none. Everything is just kind of laying there, and you have to find a way to manipulate them to wherever they need to go. Granted, it isn't far to go, but some are tight or barely reach.<br /><br />3) The Gigabyte 660 GTX Ti Video Card will fit, but the CD/DVD Drive Cage is in the way of the connectors for power. So any cards with top edge-mounted Power Connectors are a problem. If you desire this card, you'll need to look for \\"90 degree PCI Power Connector Extender\\" and buy two. Even then, you'll need to be careful on routing them. The advantage is that this card runs very silent -- more so than most. Or you could look for a card with connectors on the far end (pointing toward the front of the computer).<br /><br />4) The face design is very minimalistic. The Power ON Button is actually the end of a sliver of the trim, which flexes a bit as you push it to turn ON. Oddly enough, the CD Eject Button is the only visible protuberance on the face. Nice point of this is when you install your DVD drive, hold that door open and use a flashlight to peer behind the button zone. Push on the eject button and you can see the bump-out that actually pushes the button on your drive. This gives you perfect alignment of this with the drive as you can instantly see if it will work before tightening the screws.<br /><br />5) The cage design is poor for the drives. Not that it isn't fully-functional. But I loved earlier Shuttle boxes that kept the hard drives right on top. If there's anything I pull out of a unit more than others, it's the hard drive. With this design, you'll have to disconnect everything and pull the complete cage because the drive spaces are at the bottom. That's so very \\"Retro\\", to me. But I'm sure it's dictated by the location of that 500W Power Supply running along the side. Oh, well. One step forward, two steps back -- as the song goes.<br /><br />Other than that, this runs great, fully-configured with enough horsepower. I am not bothered by the access doors as some seem to be. I hardly interact with them. If I had more time I may have wandered off to another manufacturer as losing three Shuttles due to motherboard issues is irritating. The problem starts manifesting itself in almost the same way every time -- first, you can't get the system to boot reliably. Then the computer will cut off suddenly, sometimes restarting on its own. Sometimes it will run for hours -- no problem. Then some days it will stop and start repeatedly, losing your work every 10 minutes or so. Believe me, I tested them all fairly thoroughly. And you're lucky if Shuttle has your specific board in stock when you need one. But add $135, plus shipping, plus a weekend disassembling everything, reseating the CPU, rebuilding everything else, and another $89 for a Power Supply with only 50 more Watts, usually. All the while, keeping your fingers crossed it will work. It wasn't worth it.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Harry Hole is back in Oslo, changed but still the same Harry.  This plot has unexpected twists and turns, the same sense of danger from without and within as Nesbo's other Hole novels, and a return to Hole's old haunts and relationships.  I enjoyed this as much as the others in the series and think Nesbo is a master of the dark Scandinavian mystery movel.
B007MDB548|5.0|I have to admit that Disney's Tinker bell movies have become something of a guilty pleasure for me. I say \\"guilty pleasure\\" because I'm a 41 year old male - hardly Disney's target audience for the Tinker Bell movies! What's more, I can't even use the \\"I watched this with my kids\\" excuse cos I don't have any!! But I believe these movies can be enjoyed by people of any age - male or female! I watched Secret of the Wings last night and thoroughly enjoyed it, and it's easily as good as the other 3 movies, possibly the best yet. My favourite so far was TB and The Lost Treasure, but this could easily surpass that after further viewings. It's wintry setting with all the snow and ice really give the film an enchanting, magical feel. I watched this on Blu-ray (2D) and the picture quality - as expected from Disney - is amazing. The winter setting with it's icy whites and cool blues really look great. This film really deserves to be seen in HD. All of the animation is top notch too - everything from the characters to the beautiful falling snow looks great. Don't think for a minute that because this is a straight-to-video release Disney have knocked out a sub-par release. This looks just as good as most other CG animated films that get the full theatrical release. FYI this film was at one point known as \\"Tinker Bell and the Mysterious Winter Woods\\". I will definitely be watching this again soon, and have no doubt that younger viewers could easily watch it many, many times. There's also trailer on this disc for the next TB adventure coming in Spring 2014...I can't wait!
B001MTENOC|4.0|This book  provide an interesting look at lives between lives and gives us hope that there is much more to life than our daily grind.Individual  stories share many similarities to one another further giving credit   to the  truth to this belief.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who questions life after death.
B000P46QTA|5.0|I'm not one of those people who believe that the Best Foreign Film nominees are usually better that the Best Film nominees, but it does happen. I love Pan's Labyrinth, and certainly felt it to be better than any of the nominees for Best Film that year at the 2007 Oscars. I fully expected it to win Best Foreign Film and I was disappointed... until I saw The Lives of Others, the Oscar Best Foreign Film winner. There must be nothing worst than making a great movie and in the same year lose to an 'as good as' if not 'better' one. They are both great and very different films and whilst the Best Films for that year have pretty much faded from my memory these two I own and still watch, I believe these to be the best films I saw from that year in any language.<br /><br />That is not to say any of the Best Film nominees were bad, they're mostly very good but I believe that at the 2007 Oscars, Foreign Speaking Films trumps English speaking Films!<br /><br />(I must also say that I preferred Children of Men, The Illusionist and The Prestige to most of the Best Film nominees too, but that's a different story :0)
B0087HT36U|5.0|this is a really great game, very much an angry birds style just a bit more challenging, for this i give this game five stars.
B009DP9D6A|4.0|This album seems pretty generic compared to the uniqueness of his usual albums,  but I enjoyed it. Probably only a good album for hard core deadmau5 fans.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|like i said it works like its suppose to: shows movie/video onto tv through apple product. it will only work once you have a video playing not the process you went through to get to the video. this review is only on the iPod 4th generation. i do not know how it would work with other apple products.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|For the first time in my life (40+ years), I know how to take care of my wavy hair. Loved the book and love Deva Curl products. My hair dresser didn't know about this book and she couldn't believe how different my hair was after 4 weeks of following routine I learned in this book. She is going to read this book too!
B0015T6G2G|5.0|This is a book that everyone should read. It is very well written. It has a bit of suspense at times and it's hard to believe that you are reading non-fiction. This is a very inspiring book that I am sure gives hope to Freedom Fights everywhere.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is a great way to pass the time fun and very addictive. I played it once and just can't stop.
B00005MP58|1.0|The DVD is of poor quality. The colors are washed out and the focus is variable ( from poor to just acceptable) throughout the video. I had another copy of this with normal color and good focus throughout. I returned the DVD, and the seller was very good with this. The item is poor and in the unacceptable category, while the seller rates 5 stars.
B009HNCS9M|5.0|This episode has a really good story, great writing, and I really liked the new agent. I believe they picked a good actress to play SSA Agent Alex Blake. I also loved the scenes between Agent Blake and Chief Strauss. I think this season will be another good one
B005LAII0S|2.0|I was surprised to discover that Walt Disney supplies only the STANDARD DEFINITION digital copy with their BluRay packages.  This is very disappointing.  It seems that the Ultra-Violet digital copy is true 1080p HD digital copy which is distributed by other studios.  This was confimred by Disney and they did not seem to care that their competition was offering a true 1080p HD digital copy, and would not agree to upgrade my digital copy for Mirror, Mirror.  BAD BUSINESS DECISION..
B009GX7I2K|5.0|The episode picks up where Season 3 left off. The episode has really good writing and I loved the scenes between Agents Callen and Hanna, I also really liked the scene between Agent Hanna and Hetty. I am positively pleased with my purchase.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love it just because it gives u a challenge and gets u thinking I love to do 5 by 5 its easy and some are kinda confusing just get it u will LOVE it trust me.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|The cast still works well together. Really good writing. I believe this season of NCIS Los Angeles will be as good as Seasons 1-3. This show is still one of my favorites. I am pleased with my purchase.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected In You, second book in Sylvia Day's Crossfire series, is an amazing sequel that kept me intrigued & emotionally tied to the characters throughout the entire book! I can't wait for the next book to read more of Gideon & Eva!

B005LAIHPY|4.0|This movie was a bit on the rosey patriotic side, and as usual the Americans save the day, but it is action packed and has good graphics.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|As I read the Fifty Shades Trilogy, I became more intrigued by Ana's and Christians Emotional Need for one another.  This was truly a love story.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|This game is addictive.. Our whole family loves playing this game.. We wish that a could earn hearts faster but other than that the game is fun..
B00014TJ6Q|3.0|There are 3 of Harrison's best songs on this LP - \\"Love Comes To Everyone\\", \\"Here Comes The Moon\\", & the former single \\"Blow Away\\".  There are other decent songs like \\"Faster\\" but nothing special.  Certainly not a whole album of winners like \\"All THings..\\" or \\"Living In The...\\".  There is one song \\"Not Guilty\\" that is an old jab at Paul from the Bealtes days - in fact the Beatles recorded it for the White Album originally (and better).  This LP is worth getting but if you want just the cream then just download the 3 songs I mentioned.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|I was laughing and smiling through the whole movie. Great to see by yourself or with your significant other. I will definitely watch this again!!
B007THA4FI|1.0|Pure garbage....even though we were told for adults only....even adults have a limit..Maybe in Other countries this acceptable...but I would<br />hope Amerca hasn't gone down that bad.

B0059XTTW8|4.0|The Alec Guiness version is far superior but then they had far more time.  The characters in this are not bad but if you have not read the book you will be hopelessly lost.  Read book, watch the BBC series, then wait a year or three and watch this as a refresher.  Memory will fill in the gaps.  This has more than a few.  It's not bad, but...
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|It would be hard to go wrong with Sherlock Holmes as your base story but the writers have captured even more than the original with this series.  The 2 main players Sherlock (played exceptionally well by Jonny Lee Miller) and Watson (played just as well by Lucy Liu)just add depth to an already interesting story each week.  This can be called a bromance, but one of the bros just happens to be a woman. He said that from the very beginning and I think it's really an apt description. There's this idea that a man and a woman can't be together on a show especially without needing to be together sexually or in love or whatever, and this is really about the evolution of a friendship and how that happens. Watching that should be as much the story of this show as the mysteries that you see week in and week out about who killed who.  I just know that after 3 episodes I am already addicted.  The addition of Aidan Quinn as Captain Tobias Gregson of the New York City Police Department was genius. He genuinely likes Holmes and the two have mutual respect for each other so we get to avoid the good cop bad cop plot lines that many shows that have talented citizens playing at detectives, I love The Mentalist but this show takes the genre to a new level of entertainment.
B00973DDN2|4.0|Start to finish, this album reminds me why I love The Killers.  Highlights for me are the title track, \\"Heart of a Girl,\\" \\"Deadlines and Commitments,\\" and \\"Be Still.\\"  A Must Have
B008JFUTT0|5.0|this is such an incredible story; this man was beloved in south africa for years and his records sold like crazy there, yet here in his own country, he was virtually unknown and unsold up until now (because of the documentary...otherwise, he would probably have gone on unknown here).  when he went back to south africa (they thought he was dead; he is 70+ years old now and not in great health/condition...he has been a hard working laborer all his life), they could hardly believe it was him and their response when he appeared on stage there for the first time was chilling.  the applause and cheers went on and on.  it really made me cry; all these years of being unknown (as far as he knew) and now to have such a response to his appearance.  how amazing.  i would recommend this difficult to believe, but absolutely true, documentary to everyone whether you like documentaries or not.  you will watch it with your jaw open.  enjoy!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|great time killer. I could and do play this game as often as I can. even with all he other time killing games on my fire,  I play this one the most.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I've even enjoyed it myself, ages 4 to 82.  Great game and it's free for Kindle, how can you go wrong.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved the continued story. I was left shocked and surprised throughout this book. Can't wait until the next book comes out!
B009SJ46EA|5.0|ok, the cast from season one is gone EXCEPT FOR jessica lange.  what else do we need to know? the double Oscar winning film actress was kept and enlarged while the tv actors were switched,  big deal. we are so fortunate that these film stars are now willing to do these more limited run tv series.  and, boy, does she shine here.  she is the head nun in an insane asylum in the 1960s. she has a mad scientist on the grounds, who is conducting experiments, plus she also has a serial killer, a lesbian reporter and Chloe Sevigney (formerly of Big Love) as part of the cast.  we jump around in time periods and there may even be an alien implant and abduction as far as the serial killer. although it is not played for laughs, it is still very campy.  we open present day with a young couple prowling around the ruins of the asylum. that is when the horror begins to unfold.  it is easy to tell what time period we are in as the attention to costuming has been meticulous. plus they have cell phones with them in present day.<br /><br />all in all, i think it was smart to switch this to a whole new story.  the other story was pretty much played out and i think all but one lead character was dead.  there wouldn't have been enough to work with had we continued that story. plus this is a much meatier role for Jessica Lange.<br /><br />note: read the comments to this review.  the creators completely fooled me.  the actors on this are so good thst i failed to recognize them playing completely different roles!
0142421375|1.0|This book is intended for young adults? There was little or no indication of this in the blurb.<br /><br />Despite that, just because the target audience is a young one does not excuse the sloppy writing, the poor structure, the risible plot,  the lack of any sense of reality, and poor character development.<br /><br />A page turner? Yes, but only in the sense that to retain any interest at all it was necessary to skip large chunks.<br /><br />John Grisham, stick to what you do best.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|This was my first bought video. It was so easy to pay for it, download it and watch. I bought all the Twilight movies and can't wait until 11/16 when the next one comes out.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Follett created a microcosm of life in the early part of the 20th century that provided an insight into history that history books can't provide. His characters became people that represented the very type of people who lived then and there. Very intriguing and captivating.
B0097EWK3A|2.0|The free version only let's you play so far then no more... This turns me off... When this happens I do not pay for any game
B007THA4FI|3.0|It was interesting and the characters intermingled, but as a whole, the story was depressing and felt \\"dark\\". Maybe that was the intent, but it wasn't what I thought it would be like. Disappointed!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is the best one yet! Buy it now! If I reread the book I would still be surprised. This book is very unpredictable.
B007THA4FI|5.0|JK Rowling has done it again. She's so \\"on it\\" in her character description and story telling. She has, once again, crawled into the heads and hearts of the characters she writes about, especially the teenagers. Wonderful tale, and an honest portrayal of the lives we live and the complicated situations that make us who we are. BRAVO! Well done.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this has many fun games to play and if i could play this game 24/7 i will play it even my mom love this app
B000929AJQ|1.0|Been a huge NIN fan since PHM....pretty much everything Trent did was pure gold....he could fart into a plastic bag and I'd buy it...probably parade it around as the next big musical thing and annoy everyone.  The Fragile came out and I was underwhelmed....I listened a couple times and shelved it for a while.  I picked it back up a couple months later and fell in love with it.  The same cannot be said about With Teeth.  I bought it and was super excited for another epic NIN record....after a quick listen in the car, it was sounding really one dimensional....I thought maybe I needed to be at home and relaxed and able to fully concentrate on the recording.  Nope....nothing really there to concentrate on.  It's basically all there right from the get go...nothing to listen closer for....no nuances, no subtle genius I have loved from NIN in the past....what you see is what you get.  The single \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" is a catchy chorus...that's it.  The song is just a build up to the catchy chorus and nothing more....it's all style and no substance....like eating just a bowl full of marshmallows and no Lucky Charms.  I shelved the album and thought that maybe if I revisit it later it might grab me like The Fragile did...maybe my eyes would be opened and I'd suddenly see the genius of it...basically what happened with The Fragile and with Aenima from Tool.  I picked With Teeth back up several months later and still...the empty feeling was still there.  Picked it back up just before this review and damn...still there.  This record is just not emotionally there.  I've heard Trent and other artists talk about how you can't please everyone all the time and thatt heir music evolves.. \\"I make my music for me\\" they say....well....I hope you like it Trent because I think you can do much better....I'd rather have good old drum machine instead of Grohl...a middle of the road artist.  I know he's talented and he was in Nirvana, but he makes a LOT of music that is popular on the radio....music that is popular on the radio is popular because it is intended to appeal to as wide a number of people possible; which means it's middle of the road stuff that's just bland, uninspired product for mass consumption.  NIN I used to think was separate from all that polished shiny corporate rock, and that real art pisses people off, makes them think and makes some people hate it, which fit NIN perfectly....not so much now.

B004DTXJ4S|4.0|Another fun movie in the Resident Evil series. I wish that the clones could have had a longer role in the film.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is fun, entertaining and keeps you thinking.  worth down loading.  addictive. would invite my friends to down load
B005CRQ3LG|5.0|My son really like this book as    soon as reads this one . thanks for everything you have undergone to build this book.
1844288749|5.0|This book has a lot of quality put into the pop ups.  Lots of things to look and and discover.  Had this book as a kid and now sending it on to my niece.
B009DH2PP4|4.0|What a great book for first time brewers, as well as those who think they know what they're doing. This book gave a nice in depth analysis on all the factors of brewing.
B0037471TE|5.0|This book was written so well that I found it hard to put the book down, the action sequences were described with detail that I hadn't thought possible in a book, which made the sequences flow really well. Great plot that keeps you right on the edge of your chair, with many interesting twists and subplots, I loved it.
B009KHCT94|4.0|There is little I appreciate more than a movie that successfully makes fun of itself. Don't go into this expecting a serious big budget sci-fi opus. This is a little film that pretends to be big and provides a lot of laughs. Definitely worth a rent.
B003AQBYUG|1.0|I received the UK set and the image quality looked like it was dubbed from a blu-ray disc or copied off a monitor with a video camera. Almost as bad as Minority Report on blu-ray.<br /><br />Then another reviewer said that the US version was awful, not the UK one.<br /><br />I'm so confused! Oh, wrong movie.<br /><br />Is the studio just issuing crappy blu-ray copies?<br /><br />We shall see. Wrong movie again.<br /><br />I've noticed this same problem on some Star Trek movies from the UK too.<br /><br />I never had any video quality issues until I started buying UK stuff for less.<br /><br />Maybe you do get what you pay for - maybe not?<br /><br />I will purchase the US versions for more, and do an A/B comparison. One is going back for a refund, or maybe both?<br /><br />Blockbuster movies should always be copied from the original 4K masters. If not, then all are going to get returned. Issuing studio, are you listening?
B0086700CM|3.0|I used to love this game and I played it so much and it got boring. they need to add something to it because it gets very old and I'm sure I'm not the only one that feels that way.
B007N8RULO|4.0|This app really great on my kindle fire. Really enjoy playing in my spare time. Better than any other Spider Solitaire app because I can personalize it.
B004EPYZOO|2.0|How do you have a movie with Nicholas Cage, loads of nudity, tons of violence, deamons, shot guns that shoot deamons, and a Dodge Charger be such a horrible movie.  I work in brazil, and as there was nothing else on in english i had the privledge of watching this whole movie. ( which i would not suggest )  The effects were decent, and it did have action in it, but the dialog was nothing but horrible trash talk, and i think it was directed by a 12 year old.  I would rather buy a box of salt to pour into my eyes than be forced to watch this movie again.
B008RC72G8|4.0|The Burton/Depp formula has been tried and proven so many times that it needs no further comment. When you see them pair up, just watch it. This flick meets their finest standards.<br /><br />As a continuation of the original: I wish I could comment, but I never became a fan. But, as entertainment in itself, this offers more laughs than just about anything else in theaters this season. Depp's utterly straight-faced rendering makes the movie, of course. The simian housekeeper has his moments, and the bratty teenage girl comes into her own late in the game. (Hint: when \\"that time of month\\" comes, she has some serious issues around shaving her legs.)<br /><br />Fine, fun, and forgettable entertainment. It has some great lines, it sustains its energy, but I can't say it did much for me the day after I saw it - and that's one big way I evaluate a movie.<br /><br />-- wiredweird<br /><br />Warning: the 1970s tunes that pervade this movie might echo in your mind for weeks. \\"The lion sleeps tonight\\" - arrghh!
1451662432|5.0|I couldn't put this book down  reading it was one of the highlights of my day  It is as good as it gets  not just an autobiography but also very educational. I loved it! Good job mr. Arnold Schwarzenegger! Don't listen to the trashy reviews  no unbiased person will give this book less than 3 stars for ANY reason, in my opinion.
B009MO57H6|4.0|This movie is fifth in the franchise, which was based on a video game to start with. I think it's a sign that the series is aging when a cute little girl gets thrown in. (Same thing in one of the later Alien movies, can't remember which.) She is cute, though, gets everyone's prtoective instincts up, and doesn't get in the way of the shoot-em-up.<br /><br />Jovovich does a great job, as always. She also manages to top that white strappy outfit she wore in Fifth Element - I'll let it be a surprise, but it certainly offers plenty to anyone fascinated by the female form, and Milla's in particular. The real suspense comes in anticipating a wardrobe malfunction that never occurs.<br /><br />It's not highbrow stuff, but a good one of its sort. Popcorn-worthy, but forgettable.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is possibly one of the most well-written books I have ever read. The story is truly incredible and by the end you will feel as though you knew Adam Brown personally. I was concerned that I might not understand all the \\"military-speak\\" as well but that didn't happen at all - the story flows effortlessly, page through riveting page.<br />It was also fantastic about how easily and candidly the story of Adams faith was told in the book. As a Christian myself I was encouraged by how he shared his faith with others - an example to us all.<br />Well done to all those who paid such solid tribute to a life that was truly lived to the full. I have learned many personal lessons from this story and will be telling many others about an angel who was leant to this earth for a little while - his name was Adam Brown.
B001ECQ75A|4.0|I'm just this guy, y'know? I yam what I yam, and no one to date thought very much of it. Maybe the opposite, if you focus on a wedgied eighth grade. But I'd give anything to be this way-awesome master of way-awesome beatdown skills (on all those guys who beat me down, at least), as long as it isn't too hard. Heck, I'd take a fair beating too - not like I haven't done it before - as long as the cool guys let me hang with them.<br /><br />If you're still with me, then KFP is your ultimate fantasy. The golden goal is to find that unique power that each of us has within. Yeah, and everybody wins the race and gets a hug at the end. But maybe, just maybe, that one thing about you really can stand tall in some squirrely place in the world. Then, you are Po. Po Panda.<br /><br />Perhaps there's a reference here to Li Po, the classic drunken poet - perhaps not. I really don't care. It's just a fun flick with lots of satire on the traditional \\"work hard forever\\" themes that don't work so well in the current decade. Po is the guy you really want to like, even if he's ... well, y'know, not so hard-working.<br /><br />The animation matches the best of today's, and voice casting backs up the animated characters as well as any. My one kvetch, and little, is that Angelina Jolie's voice was way too smooth for Master Tigress. My ears just kept looking for a rocky rasp that her honeyed soprano never delivered. My problem, not yours, not hers.<br /><br />As long as you don't take the martial arts too seriously, this is a charming and humorous riff on taking them seriously. See it and laugh at it. If you can be polite about all the rest, it's warm fuzzy fun.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great reading.  Scintillating reading.  It took me back to when I read Kathleen Woodwiss' historical novels updated to modern times.
B0099114WO|4.0|Streep and Jones play a well-settled couple, empty-nesters after 31 years of marriage. The two have fallen into a rut, but Streep's character wants their marriage to have a future to look forward to - not just more of the same. So she drags him, fighting every inch of the way, to some high-intensity couples counseling. It's hardly a spoiler to say there's a happyu ending.<br /><br />To tell the truth, I'm not much o fa \\"relationships movie\\" kind of guy, and the whole counseling thing doesn't do much for me. But, against all reason, I really liked this one. Streep and Jones are masters of their art, at the top of their form. They play out the ennui, frustration, claustrophobia, and renewal in utterly believable ways. Likewise, the nervous moments with the shrink, especially when it turns to their intimate lives (or lack thereof). One of the best moments came when Carrel's Dr. Feld brought up oral sex, including the possibility of her as a receiver as well as giver. Streep seemed utterly convincing as the prim, inhibited wife who'd never even imagined the possibility.<br /><br />Truly the best part, though, was seeing it with my own Best Beloved, shring groanable moments with her of the form \\"I'm so glad we're not like THAT.\\" (Full disclosure: I've been with the same lady for 28 years, as of this writing.) And, I have to admit, we both walked out just a little more eager to please the other. Since most of the others in the theater with us seemed to be couples well past their youth, as we were, I'd venture the guess that we weren't alone in that. This gets top marks, earned equally by Streep and Jones, for bringing real life to life.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Our approach to education is based on the belief that winning academic races in childhood is a guarantee of success as an adult. It turns out that this belief is ill founded. A growing body of evidence shows that scripting childhood as a race is a disaster for two reasons. First, as demonstrated in the film Race to Nowhere, the pressure that endless competition puts on students is damaging. Second, the assumption that academic achievement in childhood predicts success in adulthood has been shown to be ill-founded. Paul Tough's How Children Succeed shows that character is a far better predictor of adult success than academic achievement. He shares research about how persistence, self-control, curiosity grit, optimism and conscientiousness are strong predictors of success. This is a paradigm changing book.

B009MF5BXK|5.0|\\"The Expendables 2\\" is an ultimate old-school action flick. No more, no less. Directed by Simon West (known for \\"Con Air\\" and \\"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider\\"), the action-packed sequel to the 2010 hit knows what it is doing. With bloody killings and self-deprecating humor, the film provides nice thrills and a few laughs.<br /><br />So, the \\"Expendables\\" are back in action, with the opening sequence about their rescue mission in Nepal. Simon West wastes no time in setting the film's tone, effectively staging an action sequence that is gory and violent. Obviously \\"The Expendables 2\\" is going to be bigger and louder, and that is exactly what we want from a sequel.<br /><br />The main story kicks in when Bruce Willis' CIA operative arrives, forcing Sylvester Stallone's Barney Ross to reunite the Expendables including Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), Toll Road (Randy Couture) and Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), as well as newly recruited Billy the Kid (Liam Hemsworth) and Maggie (Nan Yu), an agent Church sends in, in order to retrieve something that is supposed to be in a recently crashed plane in Albania. The team's mission goes awry when another mercenary group led by Jean-Claude Van Damme's Vilain - yes, that's his name - interrupts.<br /><br />The rest of the story is, as Barney says, \\"Track em, find em and kill em.\\" What else do we need to know? Arnold Schwarzenegger is back (and proudly says so, just like he always did. Chuck Norris appears briefly, with one Chuck Norris fact quoted by himself. As to martial arts action, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Scott Adkins as his right-hand man deliver some solid action scenes. A knife-wielding Jason Statham is also impressive. Jet Li has one great combat sequence.<br /><br />\\"The Expendables 2\\" does exactly what it sets out to do with lots of action, and the fact that the cast is clearly having fun makes the film more entertaining.

B008GGA5EQ|1.0|Boring not the least bit erotic.  No plot and the heroine was uninspiring.<br /><br />If I wanted to walk away from my life I wouldn't settle for being a whore, paid or not.  Puh-leese!

B005HEVBN4|3.0|The Voyager is passing through the Delta Quadrant and they hit a shock wave in space.  In a nearby red dwarf solar system a lot of debris are encircling a class M planet so the crew makes a detour to check out what has happened.  When the crew beams down to the planet's surface they find that all life on the planet has been destroyed by a massive flash of power from the inhabitant's unstable power network.<br /><br />As they explore for the cause, Janeway and Paris are pulled through a rift in time to a period one day before the explosion takes place.  They either have to find a way to return to their own time, stop the explosion or be killed by it......<br /><br />This episode for me was not that exciting.  I love Star Trek and for me to say that about an episode is unusual.  Perhaps it is because I have seen so many time travel stories in this and other Star Trek episodes. Janeway in this episode just looked like she was reading cue cards with her script on them.  Her voice at times was flat and monotonous.<br /><br />For a new series and the third episode I just found this a lackluster story and I would have thought that the producers would have wanted to put out an exciting storyline to grab your interest and not this one which was just barely OK.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a great mystery that sucks you right into the story & makes you want to read right to the end to see how it will turn out.  The style in which it's written goes back and forth between the two lead characters point of view, so it keeps you guessing on what actually is the truth and how it will turn out.
B00979OL5A|2.0|Its ok I guess!!! Its just a game to play if you don't have anything else to do!!!! I only play it because I'm just passing time when I'm waiting on someone or something!!! So really its just a short pass time Lol!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is by far one of the best games i have played in my life also because at chucke cheese it is there
B002RVZV9U|5.0|Great gift to give to the person that has everything and loves all things related to music. Awesome movie.  The way the movie is filmed it is as though you are sitting around with the legendary artists.
B000PMFVGQ|5.0|This is DVD is outstanding!  I am a non Spanish speaking American and was amazed with Shakira's performance. This is Shakira before she hit the English music world.  Watching pre-glamorous Shakira dance around in leather pants with her red tinted hair,is inspiring.  She is truly a sexy lady!  This performance of \\"Estoy Aqui\\" has to be the sexiest song I ever herd, it has placed in my top ten songs of all time.  Shakira had caught my eye with her Laundry Service and I enjoyed that CD for quite a while and found an appreciation to her Spanish singing on that CD.  Years latter I read her inspirations were from bands like Led Zeppelin, I did some research on the computer and found clips of this MTV performance.  Now I see what she is talking about, Shakira is more then a pop star.  Buy this DVD!!!

B008673ZAQ|5.0|It was all too easy to get wrapped up in this book! Once again Sylvia Day had me absorbed in the Crossfire world and all else held second place to finishing this book. Each and every word held me captive! Inpatiently awaiting Entwined in you.

B0085KGGHI|5.0|I think I have all available videos on Muddy Waters but in many ways this one is the best for the following reasons.<br /><br />1.  This is the last recording that Muddy made before his death 2 years later<br />2.  We actually get to see the most popular tribute band play with the Man that wrote the song that they named their group After.<br />3.  We get a real treat in seeing Lefty Dizz of Chicago fame who  passed on in 1993 and who in  his life  worked with such greats as Hound Dog Taylor , Jr. Wells ,and John Lee Hooker.  To my  knowledge, nothing else on DVD is available on Lefty although There are a few videos available on you tube. It is the viewers luck that we get  a glimpse of this great  musical talent,who besides his musical abilities  held a college degree in economics.  Lefty was the same performer on this video as he was in  his live shows .<br />4.  Many behind the scenes glimses of Muddy such as seeing his wife Marva sitting at the table with Muddy at his left  at the beginning of the video and later with the Stones and a full view of her at the end of the song Clouds in my heart.
B009KHBDUU|3.0|I LOVE Johnny Depp in just about every movie he's ever been in however, I couldn't figure out if this movie was supposed to be scary of funny.  Because, it really wasn't much of either.<br />I'm glad I watched it but if you miss it you won't have really missed much.<br />I feel it could have been so much more but something was holding it back.
B003O86FMW|4.0|What a surprise!  Can‘t wait to read 3.  I hope this one is made into a movie also.  Good book!
B004PKOKSO|5.0|I'll admit that I'm not terribly adept with John Scofield's catalog, nor am I a jazz aficionado.  Nevertheless, I am in love with guitar music and am always looking for the next wonderful instrumental album.  Some of my favorites include Leo Kottke's \\"6 & 12 String Guitar,\\" Michael Hedges' \\"Aerial Boundaries,\\" Peter Frampton's \\"Fingerprints,\\" and Ronnie Earls' \\"Hope Radio.\\"  Add to that list John Scofield's \\"A Go Go\\" album.  It's one of those albums that, to me anyway, seems genre-defying.  It's a bit rock, a bit jazz, a bit funk, a bit fusion.<br /><br />Now, add another title to that list.  That would be Scofield's \\"A Moment's Peace.\\"  It's just gorgeous.  The burn may be slow, but this is not mere cocktail music.  It's rich and sensual and timeless.  To say his playing is tasteful and expressive would be understatements.  The opening track, \\"Simply Put,\\" is stunning.  As is his take on The Beatles' 1968 classic \\"I Will.\\"  \\"I Want To Talk About You\\" seems to distill everything for which Scofield is known - beautiful tone, apt phrasing, exciting runs, flawless melody - and puts it all in one tune.<br /><br />There's not a dud on this album.  I love it!  Highly recommended!
B0098VYCCE|4.0|All in all this movie was a good time. The story is nothing like the original \\"Snow white\\" story, FYI> It loses a star for allowing Kristen Stewart to play Snow White. Completely unbelievable in that role.
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|Too much moving back to the beginning screen to make forward progress. Having to get back to the hotel room so many times is boring, not fun.<br /><br />I prefer having a \\"skip\\" option when the puzzle starts to cause more frustration than fun and it would be so much more helpful if the hint device was available for the puzzles and the \\"Evidence\\" page.<br /><br />I love my Kindle Fire, but for this particular game, I had to tap the screen too hard and too often to move back and forth between scenes and this game had a lot of back and forth between scenes.<br /><br />Even for all of these comments, there is an enjoyable factor and to be fair my problems may be related to me being a beginner????
B007THA4FI|3.0|I thought it was just okay.  It seemed to me that we went on a journey and ended up in the same place at the end.  Nothing really changed for anyone.  Hope she goes back to writing for young adults.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|great addition to the alien mythology. jj abrahams does a fantastic job directing. great cinematics, great sound, and the story is well paced.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I would suggest to get this game because it gust makes my little one smile so much thank you so much
B00991TCOG|5.0|If you're reading reviews to find out whether or not you'll like Lindsey Stirling's music, just go to her YouTube channel (LindseyStomp) and watch some videos.  If you're already a fan and wondering if it's worth your money to buy the whole album: yes it is.<br /><br />Many of the tracks on the album are already on YouTube, but some are slightly different versions, and all of the ones that are not on YouTube are excellent to the point that I can't even pick any favorites.  The sound quality is much better on the CD, as well, of course.<br /><br />My only complaint about the album is that it doesn't have one of my favorite tracks from her videos, \\"On the Floor, Take Three,\\" which isn't available on iTunes yet, either. I can't complain too much because the rest of the album is so good.  The album version of \\"Spontaneous Me\\" is more complex and much better than the YouTube one and \\"Elements\\" has a different ending, to name some changes.<br /><br />I bought the physical CD because I dislike iTunes, but I had no trouble legally ripping a copy to load on my smartphone with a basic free ripper.  As a bonus, the liner notes include little backstories of some of the tracks and what they mean to her.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The whole trilogy is absolutely thrilling. I read all three books with in a week because I just couldn't put the book down. You are always needing to know more. I feel these books were well written, and you shouldn't just watch the movie, READ THE BOOKS!!!!
B007TK77QE|4.0|(Yes, I read all seven HP books.)<br />This book starts out pretty slowly, and not only that, but disappointingly. The characters are unsympathetic and artificial. The writing is clunky. The story forming before you seems painfully formulaic. It feels as though JK knows what it is that constitutes an \\"adult's\\" book, and is trying her hardest to emulate exactly that, and not doing too well.<br /><br />But it picks up, the characters come to life, and the plot thickens. Oh, how the plot thickens! The Casual Vacancy is a bit like a cross between Midsomer Murders and The Slap. But it's very readable; JK hasn't lost any of her page-turning, addictive quality that made HP such a success. The story a bit soap operatic, but she tells it well.<br /><br />The other characteristic of hers that I've noted spilling through here is her need for the \\"perfect\\" ending. Not a HAPPY ending, but it must be perfect. All loose ends must be tied up. Sometimes she creates loose ends purely for the purpose oftying them together at the end, and once or twice this seemed almost laughably contrived, but it didn't really detract from the overall quality of the storytelling too much.<br /><br />Also, as a Sikh, I was somewhat... bewildered by JK's portrayal of Sikhism, given that she apparently was inspired by her admiration for gender equality in Sikhism. She did a pretty crappy job of making use of gender equality, but her translations etc, were all pretty accurate :)<br /><br />All in all, a pretty good book. I stayed up until 4am to finish it :)
B002APU580|3.0|I have seen many versions or shall we say productions of Pride and Prejudice and this adaptation is far off the mark IMHO. Jane Austen never depicted her characters in such a low class style. The characters are seductive and appear cheap and even whorish. If this Mr Bennett is a \\"gentleman\\" than Lady Catherine is right to consider him not one. Colin Firth depicts Mr Darcy as arrogantly prideful and in this version Mr Darcy seems angry and rather sad all the time. I do not think that this adaptation truly developed the characters as the BBC adaptation did so elegantly. You barely knew the characters at all and most of them truly had no depth. I really disliked Mrs Bennett in the BBC version but in this one she was somewhat likable. Mr Collins was barely able to be despised. Overall I think it it a poor excuse for a work so fine as Jane Austen wrote.<br /><br />Elizabeth<br />Trinity, AL
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I downloaded Kindle for Android so that I could take books with me wherever I went.  I have had no problems and love the app!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Free app that actually works! I like that you can. have multiple alarms built and ready to go. it works with the new DROID load.
0307477479|4.0|Usually a book with such a prestigious award does not take place in the gritty music world, but this one does and does it well.  From kleptomania to threesomes, with viewpoints in different chapters from each of the characters, this book is a unique, insightful read. I recommend it.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Rick Riordan continues his winning formula. Looking forward to the next installment. Percy Jackson character is complemented by the additional demigods introduced in The Lost Hero.@
B006LSZECO|4.0|I do not usually read thrillers, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I would recommend it for a long airplane ride or the beach.  The hours will fly by as this story unfolds.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|An eagerly waited for sequel that did not disappoint, Winter of the World, is the next chapter in the lives of the families on three continents.  It details  the coming of age of the next generation of the original families forever linked by major world events like the rise of Nazism and Fascism, World War 2 and the atom bombs being dropped.  That age of innocence begun in Fall of Giants is long gone but Follett still conveys some hope and idealism in Volodya that the Socialism begun in his father's generation with the Revolution in the USSR and the Fascism in Germany opening the eyes of young Erik as he matures into adulthood that they can make their countries the best place to live for all.  The changes in Great Britain, France, Spain and even the USA are being scrutinized as the World faces economic and social upheavals today.  I look forward to reading the installment of this trilogy.
B0054W4JQK|4.0|Enjoyed this novel very much from its tantalizing opening to the suspenseful ending. While at times the reader had to suspend belief in the narrative it kept the brain guessing right up to the closing pages who were the goodies and who were the baddies.
B004FHP9KA|5.0|Movie was great, kept me engaged the whole time.  Lots of twists and turns and you really have to pay attention to what is going on.  On demand HD was good, but had some issues with bandwidth and the move kept dropping out.  Called support and they were willing to work with me but I didnt need it by then. They quality of the HD was great, fills up my entire TV screen unlike blue ray or DVD's!  If you like movies with lots of comlexity and a sci-fi/fiction twist you will love this on.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|When this app works, it does a good job. However, it stays down so often, you never know if it is going to work. Amazon should not carry an app that is so bad.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|For Gamers this is the CPU to get. It runs fast and is a breeze to overclock. I've gotten mine up to 4.8 ghz, but I'm running it at 4.7 day to day. This was a huge upgrade from my Core i5 750.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I really liked the world and situation that is being portrayed in Wool - and it is this world as much as the people in it that is being portrayed. But that is a good thing! It's not to say that the individual characters are superficial or twodimensional - they are actually quite likeable and real.<br />But what dragged me into Wool was first and foremost the - scarily realistic - silo world.<br />My one (major) criticism is that the last book (possibly last two) was too long - dragged things out way too much.
B001EZ2T7W|4.0|Really miss this show.  It is fun to watch the episodes and see the characters interplay.  I am ready for the next Stargate show to begin.<br />I did not realize how long the show had been on for.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is challenging.  Good for killing time and keeps your attention. Anyone that enjoys puzzles will enjoy this game.
B001974DG0|5.0|Didn't even stop reading to make my family's dinner.  Totally absorbing!!!!!!!!!!!<br />All the characters were well defined and very interesting including the bad ones.<br />The dog, \\"Einstein\\" was the companion-pet we all dream about.<br />Great story to loose yourself in.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I think this is a great game. Though I also wish for faster coin regeneration. That's just because I don't want to stop; just like at the carnival! I refuse to purchase the coins. I cant justify paying for them. I use them too quickly. It would cost me a mint.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Hi,<br /><br />Again, watched this on the Amazon Instant Video thingy in HD.<br /><br />Worked well. 24 hour rental. I watched it twice. Second time started it 3 minutes before my rental was up. It finished the movie with pausing it once. (When it was over the amazon software made very sure that THAT WAS IT, and kicked me back to the amazon menu view. ;) )<br /><br />Good special effects. Presented itself as a very balanced movie. Rich in action but not hectic (camera-motion wise) and with a consistent flow. I think I was not not engaged once. I usually am indifferent to most movies and can jump in and out of a movie without regretting having stepped away for a few moments. This one was a nice experience and I would watch it again without question down the road. It's the beginning of the Alien Trilogy (which I learned from a friend because I had no clue...) and that's where it will guide you.<br /><br />What I would suggest is to wait for a director's cut because as well as this movie has been produced I think there are parts missing that would further enrich the film. And, I am sure that there is something on the cutting table that helps enlighten us further; and hopefully there will be a sequel of equal value. I have not watched Alien but this has made me curious to do just that.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Started off a bit boring, but got super interesting! loved it cant wait to read the next book.....highly reccommend it
B004FRX0MY|2.0|Purchased a couple of MP3 songs from Amazon and apparently they must be downloaded to the Cloud.<br />I purchased the songs and feel that I should be able to put them anywhere I want.  I have not<br />found how to move the files out of the cloud and put them on Windows Media Player or whatever.<br />Don't need some other file to cluter up my music.
B0037QM8YA|5.0|real life portrayle of life.  It made me feel for Precious, wanted her to make it.  Precious's mom was awful, but ultimately she was ignorant.
B0026772N8|5.0|Over the years I have read and re-read ZatAoMM, generally at times when I have big choices ahead, and always found wisdom and insight in the pages. A definite on anyone's top 10 bucket books I have to read,
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Loved the science of Fringe. Have totally enjoyed the 1st season. Nice break from reality. Can't wait to get into the 2nd season.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|The movie was very slow moving and was not that funny.  Too bad since it was a great cast.  Maybe worth a $1.00 Redbox rental but that's it.
B007THA4FI|3.0|After reading the Harry Potter series to my grandchildren, I was anxious to read and explore her adult writing.  Sadly, I was disappointed and quit reading after several chapters.  I began at the beginning at least three times, thinking I was missing something, but it never caught my attention and curosity.  To me, it was slow.  I am keeping it in my Kindle to give it another try at some other point in time.
B004UUKDNA|4.0|Foster the People's debut album Torches is fun music that takes the synth pop of the 1980's and early `90s into the present. While many of the songs sound like something you've heard before, it still sounds fresh. Many acts of this genre can come up with a catchy song or two but not hold the momentum over the course of a full disc. Fortunately, that's not the case with Torches. Also worth noting is that much like an `80s album, it clocks in at under 40 minutes, emphasizing quantity over quality. The big (huge) hit is \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" and with its memorable lyric and hooks, it's easy to see why so many people love it. Other radio hits such as \\"Helena Beat\\" and \\"Don't Stop\\" are nearly as irresistible as the former has a great singalong chorus and a bright synth line while the latter is just as catchy and reminds you a lot of the Dandy Warhols.  \\"Call it What You Want\\" and \\"Houdini\\" are both super catchy with the former showing a nod to Dee-Lite. Other strong tracks include the more reflective \\"Waste\\" and the infectious \\"I Would Do Anything for You\\" and \\"Warrant\\". The remaining songs are okay. If you love \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\", Torches is certainly worth the purchase.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|We love it and the kids (two five year olds) love it. Didn't expect some random robots to be such great characters. But it was a great movie.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I had a hard time beginning this, but after a few pages, I hated to put it down. The book alternates between the heroine's meeting with her boyfriend and the woman she turns into after he victimizes her.<br /><br />We alternate between Cathy's life before Lee--partying with her friends and taking men home from clubs--and the OCD woman who checks the doors are locked once, twice, too many times.<br /><br />We see her when she meets Lee. He's gorgeous and he's interested in her. He's great at sex, can even cook. Her friends are envious.<br /><br />And we see her when she's coping as best she can with the horror of what he's done to her. Coming home, she checks to see her curtains are as she left them and that the silverware in her drawers hasn't been rearranged.<br /><br />The suspense, I think, lies in waiting for what will happen in their relationship to turn her into the woman she is. The friends who fail her and the police who don't believe her. Dealing with the fear that the man upstairs isn't what he seems.<br /><br />Then she gets news Lee is going to be released from prison. Not only will she have to fight her OCD and mental deterioration, she may have to fight him as well.<br /><br />Good read.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Written in a very interesting style with points of view of different characters. You will find ytourself empathizing with with Auggie and celebrating his triumphs.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Better than Fifty Shades!  Characters are much deeper.  Could not put it down.  Heart-breaking, gut-wrenching turn to the ending.  Crying along with Eva. Can't wait for the third book to see how Sylvia Day ends the story. (Secretly wish the story could continue . . . and continue . . .)
B000UZNSWM|5.0|A great history of people, places and times which details the workings and the stupidity of their thoughts, actions and egos.<br />I see similarities in the responses  in our government handling of current threats to our way of life.<br />It emphasized the superiority of our fighting military and the stupidity of some of their leaders, both military and political.<br />It is a great read, and so much information.
B000PKX2KA|4.0|I purchased this GPS receiver on a lark.  Its price was unbelievably low, so what could one expect? In fact, it is a surprisingly good receiver, with only one reservation.  I run Linux as a PC operating system; no Windoze, no Windoze expense, no Windoze viruses, no 'Blue Screen of Death'... No outlandish price!<br /><br />This manufacturer is decent enough to provide a Linux driver, and it is a good one. But it is aimed at Red Hat's variety of Linux and I run Slackware.  It took me approximately three hours to find, download and in one case to compile missing libraries.  Now, this is not the maker's fault or problem, but I would suggest that it would make life a whole lot easier if they would supply generic i486 and x86-64 drivers ready top plug in for inexperienced users and (hopefully) source code for those of us who know how to make (configure, compile, link and install) software from source.<br /><br />How well does it work?  It took only seconds before it began acquiring satellites from inside my living room! This is a great little gadget, made even more impressive by my memories of early \\"portable\\" GPS receivers of the early 1980s, which weighed about sixty pounds and cost more than a good new car.  This is a nice gadget!
B005E94WB0|5.0|Not much to say about the case ... it arrived, looked brand new, fits the headset well, magnetic closure is working fine ... no complaints! It's a great case.

B008QTV3X0|5.0|Great show...keeps you guessing the whether he is a sleeper or if the CIA woman is crazy or not. Cannot wait for season two to come out.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|A great continuation to the first book, it has twist in it that you just wouldn't expect. Love how it is telling the story of two people trying to overcome their terrible past to be with one another. Left me ready for the third book.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game. good way to pass time without havin to do too much.<br />would be nice to have more energy though
B0084I9QLY|5.0|It is a great piece of my MJ collection and I would recommend this to any Michael's fan. The package arrived in perfect condition.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is super fun I was addicted after one run I would download if I were u its free!!
B0098VYCCE|2.0|This movie got off to a pretty good start.  The filmography was good, and the characters started off with good potential.<br /><br />About half way through the movie, the acting took a sharp decline, and the plot went sideways.  The ending left you inching to the edge of your seat but rather than hoping for more, you fell off.  It was almost a cliff hanger, but ended up being a real let down instead.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game reminds me of the old games like these at the Long Beach Pike when I was a kid. Fun to play.
B0088RQ4TI|3.0|Having not known anything about John Carter, I thought the movie was entertaining, but certainly a bit 'over the top'.  But it was a good escape for an afternoon.
0449000729|4.0|I will be traveling to the British Isles and wanted to start reading about them, and this seemed a good overview book.  It was reasonably priced for my kindle.  The only flaw with the kindle version is that the family tree charts are hard to see if you don't enlarge them, and you'll need to bookmark them to go back and forth or be lost in the families.<br /><br />The sheer research needed to write a book like this and the understanding of it is immense.  Added to that the creativity of adding characters to play on the scenes of history, my hat is off to the author.  This is history made into a series of stories that follow a few families.  At times I enjoyed it and other times I had to knuckle down and keep going.  Usually it takes me about 2-3 days to read a book, this took me almost 2 weeks.  Admittedly, I had to take a couple breaks and read other books during that time.<br /><br />What didn't work for me was that some characters were 1 or 2 dimensional.  And sometimes just when I started getting into a storyline, it changed to another time.  This was also a largely patriarchal story, the women mostly got sidelined save for a few.  Even Boudica got only a fleeting mention.  But in the end, this is much more readable than a straight history book.<br /><br />I learned a lot of the history of England and the area from this and am glad that I spent the 2 weeks with this book.  It will give me a jumping off place to learn about other parts of history there.

B003UAKE9Y|1.0|I got this movie for my kids for Halloween.  We we watched it I was very disappointed.  It was weird......story didn't make any sense.  Neither myself or my children understood the point of the movie.  And I have to say that the sceen with the large busted woman with a bikini bottom and pasties on was a little inappropriate for my kids (6 and 8yrs.).  Luckily neither of my children noticed it much except for my daughter to comment \\"she has huge boobs\\".  I wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone with younger kids.  I guess if you like Tim Burton you might enjoy this movie but I think most of his work is a little out there.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|This is the lead on from Fall of Giants.<br /><br />It's based on the German invasion and persecution of the Jews and then the defeat of Hitler by the Russians and British reinvasion of Russia and France and then the fall of Germany.It also touchs on the bombing of Pearl Harbour and then the creation of the  Nuclear Bombs and the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaka to end the war.<br /><br />The siblings from \\"Fall Of Giants\\" are the main characters of this book.<br /><br />Americans: Gus and Rosa Dewar now have two boys Woody and Chuck.

B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I love the Bluegrass/Rock sound Mumford and Sons puts out there. This album is a little more cheery than their last but still has the same great sound.

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Great entertainment, really get hooked on getting more coins and the gifts.Really enjoy this game would recommend it to all.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it so much it has so many games you should get this game because. you will love it.  you wont wanna stop playing this game they should make another one with even more games
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|The only problem I had is how often it asks for a rating.  Once that is done, just have fun.  This is one of the few games that I play through again and again.
B009KUANWG|5.0|Another great ballad from Adele.  Seeing the promos with the song makes me want to see the movie even more.
B006R1T40I|5.0|This is a really polished CD. Excellent variety of songs, and a great selection of players in her new band. Raitt is a fine singer overall, and possibly the best ballad singer out there. (Makes me remember that her dad was one of Broadway's great baritones) I was especially pleased to see Mike Finnigan onboard, playing his Hammond B-3 and doing background vocals. I first saw Finnigan perform back in 1972, and have followed his career since. It's unfortunate that he's relatively unknown outside of musician's circles, because he is arguably one of the greatest singers of the last 50 years, not to mention a stellar keyboardist and arranger. I hope when Ms. Raitt takes her show on the road that she offers Mike the opportunity to do some solo vocals, as the audience would be in for an amazing experience.
B008220AVW|4.0|I love Katy Perry's music and I didn't expect to love her movie. I t has some very moving emotional scenes, along with some humorous moments.
B000002GYN|5.0|Released in 1972, the Eagles self-titled debut album is easily one of the strongest debut albums of all-time! This record would set the stage for a decade-long dominance almost unrivaled in musical history.<br /><br />The Eagles took a very shrewd approach to making their mark on music history. They took the country rock sounds of the Byrds and mixed it with the easiness of the folk rock craze of the era. Simply put, The Eagles took a lot of what was popular and made it even more accessible to the public. This record did exactly what the Eagles wanted, made country rock a force to reckoned with throughout the 1970's. While every song on this album is solid enough, my favorites are \\"Chug All Night\\", \\"Nightingale\\", \\"Take The Devil\\" and \\"Take It Easy\\".<br /><br />If you only know the singles from this terrific band, your seriously missing out on some awesome music. If you like the breezy sounds of the 1970's, you'll want to check this album out, you'll not be disappointed!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|It's obvious the author has been involved in a relationship in which trust Is gradually lost . A scary depiction  that shows you that you never really know another person  the way you think you do. Fast moving and well written.
B000002GYW|5.0|Released just a year after their debut album, \\"Desperado\\" is a continuation of what the Eagles did better than anyone, make country rock for the masses. On this album the Eagles took the next step and made one of the greatest rock albums of all-time!<br /><br />\\"Desperado\\" is my all-time favorite Eagles record. Every song on here is a winner, and could have very easily been a radio hit in the early 70s'. The song writing on this album is also first-rate and it shows just how talented the guys in this band would become. Songs like \\"Outlaw Man\\", \\"Outta Control\\", \\"Doolin' Dalton\\" and \\"Desperado\\" are highlights, however, you'd be hard-pressed to find any duds on this baby.<br /><br />This album is absolutely terrific as it was, but when it was remastered and re-released it made an awesome record even better! I suggest if you like the Eagles, or anything from the 70s' you give this album a shot. No way you won't love this monster the whole way through!
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is a very addicting game to play. You start outwith Guy Dangerous and use the character to collect coins through various mazes and having to leap over fire and duck under trees to escape the Demon Monkeys that are angrey at you for steeling they're idol Once you've collected enough coins in the game you can buy or upgrade helpers that make you survive longer in the game or if you have 10,000 or more coins you can by characters that are cunning, fast, or strong. But you also have achievements in the game to where sometimes you can't collect coins or have to run a certain amount of miles. But here's a hint you are very busy you can by coins in the more coins space.......... But becareful you have to use real money.<br /><br />  Hope you enjoy the game!
B000002GXX|4.0|\\"One Of These Nights\\" is the fourth and most successful record the Eagles released to that point of their career. Honestly a terrific record, this albumn is chalked full of ballads and seems like the guys made this album for \\"sales\\" rather than for music sake.<br /><br />While their most popular record of their first four, this album falls short of the glory that was their first three records. For some reason this record just blew the roof off for the Eagles. The album is another winner for the band, but like I said earlier, it seems to be made to sell, rather than made to kick some serious butt. However I feel personally about this album, it does have some really good songs on it as well. Songs like \\"One Of These Nights\\", \\"Too Many Hands\\", \\"Take It To The Limit\\" and \\"After The Thrill Is Gone\\" are awesome, but the rest are decent as well.<br /><br />If you like the Eagles, or anything from the 70s' era, you'll like this record quite a bit. The remastering is great and really adds to the album, whether you should replace your old one or not is up to you.
0385344333|4.0|A WANTED MAN<br /><br />by LEE CHILD<br /><br />I've read most of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels and enjoyed them.  Some have been better than others.  This one falls sort of in the middle - not the best and not the worst. On a side note, I'm having a hard time envisioning Tom Cruise playing Reacher in the upcoming movie.  In my mind, I see more of a Liam Neeson type.  In the books, Jack Reacher is 6'5\\"and over 250 pounds - a hulking guy and a formidable presence.  (Makes me wonder how on earth the casting director could even think of Tom Cruise in that role)  Tom Cruise is a good actor but hulking he is not.  It will be interesting to see how he makes the role his own.  Of course the beauty of reading is that we can imagine our own characters.<br /><br />A WANTED MAN begins where the last book ended.  Reacher is trying to make his way to Virginia to meet a woman he feels may be part of his future.  Reacher has no home, no possessions.  He carries only a toothbrush.  He has literally no baggage - buys a new set of clothes every 3 days or so which negates the need even for doing laundry.  Trouble seems to find Reacher wherever he goes, and he always dives right into it, trying to help the good guys win.  Half the fun in these books is trying to figure out exactly who those good guys are!<br /><br />This book is a little slower-moving than most, perhaps because of the setting in the middle of Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas farmland - not a hotbed of excitement (I'm originally from Kansas so I say that with affection).  Reacher is hitchhiking and is picked up by some questionable characters.  As usual, Lee Child throws in plenty of twists and turns in the plot - some reasonable, some rather unbelievable.  But hey - I believe in °the willing suspension of disbelief\\" in reading fiction.  That's why they call it fiction.<br /><br />It's a good read.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I did not read The Harry Potter series but of course I knew of their success.  I was very interested to read a novel of hers and loved The Casual Vacancy.  It was descriptive, clear, easy to follow with complex characters and fabulous story line.  I have reccomended it and always will!  One of my faves :)
B007THA4FI|3.0|I don't agree with the  harsh comments I've been reading about this book: JKR has captured the claustrophobic atmosphere of small town England, with the accents and all, depending on the character's age & social rank.
B004IQ78HA|4.0|I watched Disney's animated \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" at the request of my 10 year-old daughter. Based on my (decades-old) memories of seeing this in the theater, I was fully expecting a sugar overload. To my surprise and great pleasure, I was treated to a riot of color, manic activity and enough edgy darkness to make this a truly worthy Lewis Carroll adaptation.<br /><br />Featuring voice-work from some of old Hollywood's greatest character actors, the animators seemed inspired to explore the limits of their wildest imaginings...creating a Wonderland of marvels, wackiness and more than a bit of real danger.<br /><br />The result is an animated film that is a visual joy for youngsters, and a guilty pleasure for their parents.<br />If you don't have a kid, but luv great animated films...treat yourself to \\"Alice In Wonderland\\" anyway.
0920668372|5.0|When I was young my mom read this to me and from then on when we got mad at each other, she would say \\"I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, As long as I'm living, My baby you'll be\\". It is a memory I will forever treasure. When my sister-in-law announced her pregnancy, I sent it as a gift. Now she reads it to my baby nephew all the time and they are creating their own bonding memory. Such a special book! Please share this with your loved one!!!
B003QSS2VW|2.0|Between the 'classic' Disney animated era ('Sleeping Beauty', 'Alice In Wonderland', 'Peter Pan', '101 Dalmations' etc.) and the 'new' era ('Little Mermaid', 'Beauty & the Beast', 'The Lion King' etc.), there was a long period of animated indifference that nearly put the Disney Studio out of business.<br /><br />\\"The Aristocats\\" is typical of that era: poor (sketchy) animation, scripting aimed at ages 6-and-under and characters 'borrowed' from other, better Disney flicks.<br /><br />My young daughter found enough in it to giggle all the way through; but, she also likes reruns of 'Scooby-Doo'. I found my teeth grinding  in anticipation of its ending.<br /><br />'The Aristocats' has some redeeming aspects: nice voice-over work by Phil Harris (essentially doing a feline vamp on his 'Baloo the Bear' schtick from 'The Jungle Book'), Eva Gabor and the (always delightful) Sterling Holloway. On the other hand, having two 'Hee-Haw' hounds (Pat Buttram of 'Green Acres' and George Lindsey of 'The Andy Griffith Show') are jarring in the middle of a movie about French cats. Like I said, scripting was not a priority to the producers of this cartoon (as opposed to 'animated film').<br /><br />If faced with a choice of viewing 'The Aristocats', or something like 'Scooby-Doo' or 'Pokemon', the Disney flick is the better bet. Other than that, I would avoid it altogether.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|If your a fan of the 80's, video games, or just pop culture in general.  then give this book a try.  It was a joy to read.  there were times when it seemed like it was a first novel (which I think it was)  but thats just nitpicking, all in all a very fun book to read.<br /><br />there was a mention at the end from the author about it being picked up as a possible movie.  I dont forsee that happening, buying the rights to all the pop culture references alone would bankrupt any movie budget. If it does get made on the other hand, I think it has the potential to become one of the greatest Geek movies of all time.  destined to be a cult classic.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This is a great companion to the Let it Be Cd..although I never had a problem with the Original Cd .. this release is very raw and has a \\"live\\" feel. It makes you feel like you are in the room with the Beatles.. the soundstage is excellent and the sound compares or in many ways exceeds that of the new 2009 remasters...??...The dynamic range of this CD is perfect...Side by Side I love the original Let it Be... but owning both of these CD's will enlighten you...
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|If you are just looking for a something that is fairly entertaining, has a bit of spectacular special effects and is pretty family friendly then Marvels Avengers is likely your cup of tea. If this sort of thing makes you giddy, then you will probably love the movie and see it as a 5 star event. Its a good romp of a view but the story is shallow, the character too campy and the cliches while providing a good chuckle at times don't do much to punch up what is really a lack luster and all too predictable story line. It should be mentioned too that it is helpful for understanding the story line (unless you are a dyed in the wool Marvel comics aficionado) to have seem the previous movies for Iron Man, Thor and Captain American. If you didn't catch it I omitted the Hulk here as the characters demeanor for the Hulk was so inconsistent that it almost hurt to have seen the previous Hulk movies. Some people will probably like this new character portrayal but having been with the big guy through, comics, movies and TV shows over the past 40+ years I personally felt it was the worst Hulk portrayal I had seen yet. In addition to this list it's not a great surprise that two new character are thrown at you as there are plenty of Marvel heroes to choose from. To sum up its good, but it's just not great. So not wanting to be too nit picky I have to close by saying even given the short comings of the movie, and there are some, you could do a lot worse. So grab some popcorn, your favorite comfy chair, set your expectations to medium and enjoy!
B007X1ZQSU|4.0|I must admit that I purchased this CD set looking to explore new music...the price was great and the band has a great reputation...That being said. I love this collection...it has a massive 70's feel to it..and the recordings sound very good..not great... but very good for 70's recordings. This band inspired so many 80' and 90's artists ...with the twin guitar leads and massive bass lines...this band is no joke..the music just screams 70's rock...but you can feel the angst and \\"underground\\" tinge.  Love it...and you should def buy this collection....it will make you a Thin Lizzy fan...be careful..you may end up purchasing the remaining CD's in their catalog.<br />Rockin!
B0086700CM|5.0|Fun game to have. I am glad I bought it and unfortunately it is an easy game to kill a few hours on
B005ZBBKHQ|5.0|Remasters are sometimes deceptive...you wonder what they actually did with the recording... I have also noticed that the system makes a huge diff to what you will get out of any remastered recording...that being said... this remasted collection is amazing...hats off to Rober Smith and the remaster team...bravo! What they did was basically take these albums and breath new life into the recordings...the dynamic range is huge....compared to the original release...and regardless of your system...you should def notice how wonderful this remaster is....plus the music on these CD's are what I consider essential music to own.... A must buy for any music fan...<br />Great Job !
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Better than the movie...going  to download the next book now! Can't wait for the next movie to be made soon
B006Z21ZGK|5.0|A must buy... Iron Maiden live...Maiden fans will love this...the band is right on and the sound is amazing...spectacular. Iron Maiden has proved over the years that they are the most amazing touring act in the world.. this video is a testament to that ideal...
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A wonderful story, as soon as you start reading it you can not put the book down. I wish this book never had an ending because I would like to know more about what happens in Charlie's future.
B004GTLFNW|5.0|Mark Lauren educates me in this book that I don't need a gym to workout! Save your money! As long as you have yourself; we have no excuse not to train. This book is the real deal. Mark Lauren is the real deal. If you are looking for a fad, this isn't it. If you are willing to work; this book teaches you how to get in \\"rip roaring\\" shape! Hooyah!
0061134007|5.0|An enormously long, twisted novel by an exceptionally talented writer that fascinates. Overly long, to me, sub-plotted to within an inch of its life. But much of it grabs and holds the heart and the mind. Why only four stars? One thinks some of it could have been thinned out. Pieces could have been removed -- and should have been. But I will read every one of the Hole series. This one was my first. I could do little else with attention while reading it. That counts for something, doesn't it?    Update: 8/12/14  Having reread The Redbreast, I realize that I should have rated it five stars to begin with -- as I do now. The book is not unduly long and could not have been shortened without leaving out needed things. (I confess that I did not cope well with the Norwegian names, all of which and all of whose connections are hard to remember and take into account as one moves along in the tale, with everything coming together toward the end. I did better the second time through.) This book is not only fascinating and gripping in its own right, but essential to understanding Harry Hole's key romantic relationship, started here and integral to what else happens, played out in subsequent novels. Without spoiling things, I cannot reveal why such close attention to what Harry learns here, and thinking about it and who else knows, is so important, but it is. The first two Harry Hole novels are not linked to this, perhaps explaining why they were published later rather than up front. I recommend Redbreast without reservation and it ought to be read first, before getting into the later books. Having done that, read them all. All of them are superb!
B004GJDQT8|3.0|I'm using this app on my Asus Nexus 7 tablet with Jelly Bean 4.1.1 and, so far, this app doesn't measure up to other apps that I have on it. For instance, it doesn't have product pictures on the search results! What a pain! Still, it's better than going to the website to manage my Amazon stuff.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Truly enjoyed the movie.  Well done, and the characters complimented each other very well.  It is such a pleasure to watch a movie that lifts your spirits and makes you laugh and feel good.
B004G8P142|1.0|So glad I did not read this while in school. I read it when I was much older and found it to be very boring and VERY predictable and a real waste of my time.
B005HEDNEO|5.0|I remember watching Star Trek TOS with my grandfather in syndication in the 1970s and haven't watched the original since, though I am a moderate fan of all of the other franchises. On recommendation of a specific episode, I came back to the original series with both anticipation and trepidation. I remembered the mini-skirts and the sixties costumes and hair and worried that the series would be all cheese. I am happy to report that even though Star Trek is popcorn fun, serious questions are raised as well and this series is a classic not only because it was groundbreaking in its time, but on its own merits.<br /><br />In this episode, three beautiful women, the property of a space-fareing conman are brought aboard the enterprise to the sexual discomfort of all aborad. When crystal, required to run the entire ship are compromised and a mining colony must be visited, Harry Mudd plies his wares in the mining colony and queers Kirk's pitch for acquiring the desperately needed crystals. But, the women have a secret too, their allure is not all it appears. The episode asks questions about beauty, biology and love and with enough cheesy fun that you almost don't realize such serious questions are being asked. I am very much enjoying my reintroduction to Roddenberry's original utopian vision.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|I really wanted to like this movie, but I just didn't.  It does \\"sort of\\" answer questions, just not in any novel or unexpected way, and I would have preferred a plot and some character development over the very pretty special effects clearly set up for a 3D release.  I watched it after a Quadrilogy marathon along with \\"Planet of the Vampires,\\"  in which was Scott's inspiration for the alien ship, and which made it suffer by comparison, I think, which is saying a lot since Planet of the Vampires is a seriously \\"B\\" movie. This is Ridley Scott and HR Giger.  I expected so much more and was disappointed and sorry I'd bought it for my Alien collection, instead of just renting it.  Less effects and better art direction for mood and atmosphere might have saved it from no-plot, no character development land, but there was very little to none of either.  Perhaps Scott will release Prometheus Redemption with these elements, but I won't be rooked into buying it.  At least when you \\"have to buy The White Album, again\\" you know The White Album is really good. Rent it, if you must, before you add it to your Alien collection.  Perhaps they should have hired Pinback to write the screenplay.
0316228532|1.0|I love the Harry Potter books. Rowling has managed to create an entire world about wizards and make it believable with a story that gripped you. When I heard that she was finally writing a book for adults, I expected that the same wonderful storytelling would be there without the restraints of writing for children. Unfortunately, I was wrong.<br /><br />I found this book to be incredibly boring. I had to literally force myself to read it, and even stopped and read other books between some sections because reading The Casual Vacancy was more punishment than joy. The story itself is pretty simple, people trying to fill a spot on the local council left by the death of a member. The problem is that the book is overlong with characters thinking the same things over & over (having to repeatedly read Colin Wall's ridiculous thoughts drove me crazy), I didn't find a single character likeable & apparently, this town attracts every bad parent in the area. Even when a tragedy occurs, it's completely expected & means nothing, I wasn't interested enough in the characters involved to care. I've heard this book being described as a dark comedy. I get the dark, but where was the comedy? I don't remember laughing, or smiling, or even being mildly amused, just bored, bored, bored.<br /><br />I never thought I would give a JK Rowling book a rating this low, but I dislike this book so much I plan on selling it to a used book store. I'm just glad that reading it is no longer a chore that is hanging over my head.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|The only really legitimate complaint about this near-motherload of Springsteen from the Darkness period is that there isn't more. Maybe a live CD (to go with the video) from one of the many legendary shows from the Darkness tour where Springsteen and the E-Street band were as good as they (or anyone else) ever were ?  The bootlegs from this era abound (sorry) and many of them would be welcome proof of just how great the band was in 1978 (the Winterland and Cleveland Shows for example).<br />Anyway what is here (and it is a lot) is all good and then some. The price is fair -- especially given what the some artists are now charging the true-believers for fully-loaded boxed sets far less inclusive than this one.<br /><br />If you ever wondered why Springsteen was great this box proves it.  Could I suggest some substitutions -- or more likely further inclusions -- sure. I think any Springsteen fan probably could.<br />But as long as this is what we are reviewing than the answer is \\"******\\" and lets hope more materials (especially live) from the Darkness era are forthcoming from  Bruce and Sony. Maybe he could do a Bootleg series like Dylan or more exhaustive archives like Neal Young?<br />Bruce is still a very vital artist and perhaps he wants to shy away from too much nostalgia... I hope he remembers that he has some truly insatiable fans that (as Bruce said in one of the famed 1978 shows about his own goals) \\"wanted everything.\\"
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Nesbo's black noir story is a great book of its kind.  Captures Oslo and the black mood of its protagonist well.  As in his earlier books things bet blackest just when you think they will get better.  Much like my Norwegian relatives.  Pretty riveting, but not cheery.
B007TBZ63Y|2.0|While I have been a huge fan of Mr. Riordan's work, I think that the heavy workload of two concurrent series negatively effected The Mark of Athena.  I felt like many of the characters were flat, the unstoppable giants have been extremely unimpressive throughout the series, and the story felt rushed and extremely formulaic.  I had high hopes for this series, but each book has made me less less interested than the one before.  Hopefully now that Mr. Riordan's workload has decreased, the quality of his work will greatly improve.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|For anybody who either grew up in the 80s or is a sci fi/fantasy fan, this book is a must-read. I originally bought the audio version, to listen to during my commute. I found myself looking forward to the beginning and end of the workday, just so I could catch up. By the way, Wil Wheaton's narration is fantastic! Once the weekend arrived, I couldn't wait until Monday to finish listening to the book, so I bought the Kindle version and just finished reading it. It's definitely one that I will read -- and listen to -- again and again. Very well done. Part of me hopes they make a movie, but the other part of me cannot see how a movie would do it justice, unless it's several hours long. Or directed by Peter Jackson...
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I can not tell you what wonderful read this was.  Was so disappointed the next sequel out yet!<br />I will be on the look out for the next book!
B003DWC6IQ|4.0|I try to read all of his books as they are so realistic. His characters are like the real people one meets every day. They make relaxing reads and one has to read them to the very last word to find out what is going to happen next - or at the end. One is usually wrong if one tries to guess what will happen to whom next.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app has a lot of options and is easy to use. I like it a lot and use it whenever I need an alarm for something.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|[[ASIN:B004MC8CA2 Bible]]Any copy of the Bible is a five star to me but having this one installed in my phone is a blessing because I can listen to it being read while I'm driving or waiting in the doctor's office or at work. It's a blessing to me to hear the Scriptures read to me anytime, anyplace. I believe anyone interested in the Holy Scripture would enjoy this app.<br /><br />This app was free at Amazon for my Kindle Fire, my Kindle Fire HD and my android phone.
0525953728|5.0|This is an awesome book. I could not put it down. You would be a fool not to buy this book!. Happy reading.
0982954328|5.0|I regard The Hound of the Baskervilles to be the most overrated Sherlock Holmes story.<br /><br />For some reason, it's practically the only story most will read and/or see a film of. And the mass public, as far as it is concerned, thinks that that's all Sherlock Holmes there is, and the rest is picked up by the many, many awful movies that don't resemble a fraction of what the legendary character is about.<br /><br />Back to the story, yes..it's well-written and very enjoyable to read. Many will be surprised to see that Sherlock Holmes plays a very little role and is mostly out of the scenes throughout the story. That's why The Hound of the Baskervilles is not really good definitive Holmes story because what he is and how he goes by his sleuthing work are best described in other earlier stories.<br /><br />For sure, The Hound of the Baskervilles should be thought of as an aberration, but I am not bothered by it. It is amusing to see Holmes to be referred as the &#34;second highest expert in Europe&#34; after Alphonse Bertillon. Tough luck.<br /><br />Really, the best Holmes story of any will always be The Sign of Four. Of course, The Study in Scarlet is not even that bad either, but I get put off by the long winding story in the second part of it.<br /><br />All in all, The Hound of the Baskervilles is certainly overrated because probably it's easier to read?
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I bought this book with great expectations, and it delivered flawlessly. Pat Peoples may not be your typical hero, but that is what made this such a fun read. Definitely a page turner.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Although some of the content in the whole trilogy could be disturbing to some, the overall concept from fairly twisted to \\"FREED\\" was thought provoking.  How many of us women have ever listened to our \\"inner goddess\\" and how many wish we had?  Excellent book and very insightful into realms we don't really want to consciously explore.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I got this item as a gift for my boyfriend for his birthday nd he absolutely loved it!! It was a great price nd it got here just on time#! I was really really happy with how everything turned out
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I read this book several years ago and recently bought it in the kindle version for a friend.  I love this series so much, that I just had to introduce it to a friend.  I knew he would love it as well.  Jack Reacher is a really fascinating character that you find out about a little at a time in each book.  These books are fast paced.  You find Reacher an interesting character that surprisingly gets out of the worst situations.  And best of all, he fights for the underdog.  He gets involved in issues and situations that need a man like him to help resolve.  I'm really looking forward to the upcoming movie based on this character, though I must admit that I would never have seen Tom Cruise as playing this character.  Tom simply can't physically match the character who is 6'5\\" and 250 lbs.  Let's hope Tom can sell it!  Read this series, you won't regret it!
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|This little game may be fun for some, but not for me. It just didn't hold my interest. Nothing happens; just the same old thing all the time, then you run out of coins. I played it a few times, then removed it from my Xoom.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|My only request is that the books be longer<br />I love the story and can't wait for the next one in the series
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|g-ma plays this game the most and she it hooked!  Every day I come home from work she is playing this game, she's just like the kids!!
B0081KTI0E|3.0|I was ready for a good case of suspense and even scary night. It was slow going and a bit predictable.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book. I couldn't put it down once started reading I actually had to force myself to stop so I could go to sleep.  While I saw some reviews saying it was for the Twilight crowd I read the sample before buying the whole book unable to stop reading and I personally HATE Twilight. I would recomend this book to young adults looking for a quick but wonderfully romantic read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is an excellent game. It relaxes me as I end a busy workday. I recommend this game to anyone who needs to release a little stress.
B004P4S4NM|4.0|The songs are beautiful and Adele is a great artist.  Downloading the album however was not a pleasant experience.  For those people that normally download music from Amazon, probably is not an issue for them.  Overall, I would reccomend the Album.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I wanted to be able to access my calendar from my Kindle Fire and this app has been able to make that happen. Very pleased with the ease of use and seamless integration with my other calendars.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This ap is intuitive and fun and simple and also free. I play two or three times a week when I'm wanting to kill a little time. I recommend it.
B009K0OPQQ|5.0|As always Once delivers a great show. I love the interweaving of the two time lines. The different spins on the classic fairy tales are really well done. I put the episodes on my kindle just so that I can rewatch them.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I am a big Ken Follett fan and have read most, if not all of his historical fiction and I think this may be one of his best books. It is every bit as good as the first part of the trilogy.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Our bookclub chose this book based on J K Rowling's past successes. It began alright, shaping up to perhaps be funny and ironic, but it slid into just plain dark. Most characters were disturbed, or possessed or evil. There was nothing uplifting about the book, which didn't credit anyone with any spirit of human kindness, and it left me feeling slightly ill. I have recommended to friends that even if they have purchased the book, dump it, don't read it, and just consider it a bad investment.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Nice relaxing music to go with a mentally challenging game. I really enjoy this game. It is unique and doesn't feel like a spin off of a common game. Worth the money...buy it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great if you are bored..... like I said it's the new fun!!!! you should check it out
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Great Book keeps one hooked on the series.  Fun book to take on a trip<br />and E version is all I buy, great collection to keep.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fantastic game, I even got my wife to play it.  I can't stop playing it.  I'll be looking forward to more Fallen Tree Games.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and didn't realize just how much the SEAL families have to go through. I like his attitude and he is a true American Hero. Thank you all that have served our country.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is very basic, but the buttons are huge so it's easy to read.  I use it for household tasks, balancing checkbook, etc.  I'm very happy with it.
B003GDFQX4|5.0|rate this novel at five stars because: 1. It is well written. 2. It is based on several unrelated facts or events interwoven with pure fiction in such a manner that it seems to be true. It is, however, a story which does portray the inner workings of high politics, both national and international in a striking manner. In many ways the intrigues in this story can be seen to happen nowadays with only characters and places changed.<br /><br />The Day of the Jackal from Amazon
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|This album is truly addicting!! It's another masterpiece from Adam Lambert! It's so good that it's hard for me to choose favorites from it! lol Other than one track that I wasn't too fond of it, it's an amazing album. I'd recommend it!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I am a big fan of Rick Riordan, I've read all the books he has put out so far and this one was in no way a disappointment. While i wouldn't say it's the best one of the olympian series it's definitely pretty close to.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|love it so easy to use. I don't use anything else. my whole family uses it. I give it 5 stars because its the best
B007SGM084|5.0|I truly LOVED this trilogy so much...hated to have these books end.  Amazing that a set of books can make<br />a 60 year old woman feel like she is 19 again!!!  I was never a reader before the Fifty Shades Trilogy...<br />I LOVE reading now...
B008QTVNUI|5.0|HOmeland is seriously the BEST show on TV, but beware, you will become addicted immediately. Once you start with episode one you will have to keep watching - forgetting all about eating, drinking, sleeping, working or taking care of your family - until you have finished the whole season. The nice thing about having the whole season is that you don't have to wait a week for the next episode! Of course once you are hooked it's on to the current season 2 -- and when you are caught up you will be waiting eagerly for Sunday night to come! Every episode contains many \\"OMG\\" moments! Enjoy!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I downloaded app so i could use device at bedside. It does exactly what it says it does. works great!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Love this show! Well written, acted and directed! I don't know anyone who doesn't love this show!  Well worth the cost to pay for the season.
B00884GR0W|5.0|this game is so awesome and I cant stop playing it! this is the best game on the kindle fire
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|The coins go fast.  I do not buy the coins so I have to wait for free coins. It is habit forming.
B004GTOKO8|5.0|I'm so glad to have found this GEM.. No rush here but solid storytelling with insight historically into the bygone time of horse transportation moving into the era of the train.., amongst many other insights... I found it heart warming...
0316228532|5.0|Like all of the other reviews say, this book contains foul language, is written from the perspective of a dozen or so deeply flawed characters, and in many portions is horribly graphic when it comes to drug use, incest, rape, violence, and neglect. It is, however, masterfully written and tastefully done. There is not a single instance of violence for the sake of violence, and every page propels the story further. The novel is, however, more than five hundred pages long, so don't expect the classic build-up, climax, conclusion. The story ends without any great resolution and there certainly isn't a classic happily-ever-after.<br /><br />I loved this book. I found all of the main characters engaging on some level or another with varying degrees of complexity, but I was able to sympathize with each and every one. There is no arch enemy of the story: there is more of a spectrum of likability. There is a realistic distribution of good and evil in each of the characters-- even the characters who commit the most vile acts are able, to some extent, to redeem themselves in their past or future acts.<br /><br />On the subject of the style: this is very much a Rowling novel. There are aspects that you don't notice on a single pass of the Potter novels-- like the immersion given by writing from the point of view of a single character, and only knowing what they know, without explicitly saying so-- that are absolutely present here. I don't, however, see how this story could be considered \\"black comedy\\". It is a sub-genre of realistic fiction, to be sure, but while I remember feeling physically ill, terribly sad, and mildly content while reading, I don't remember a particularly funny portion. There is, perhaps disappointingly, no whiff of Fred or George Weasley.<br /><br />Overall, my advice is to read the book with an open mind. This is not a Harry Potter novel, so don't expect it to be similar. Read it as you would any other story, and if you don't like the topic, it's not really the fault of the author, is it?
B009GENZ12|3.0|The twist is very strange. The movie is really strange altogether. It is still watchable. Slow moving until the end.
1401923127|5.0|Bruce H. Lipton Ph. D. successfully cloned stem cells, and in the process he discovered that the mechanics of human cells (that together create the bodies we live in) are run by the same science of quantum physics that runs our cell phones. Perhaps a human body is a cell phone to the Universe? Perhaps, we use our cell phone bodies through automatic speed dial? Perhaps they are preprogrammed with DNA and our childhood experiences? And maybe, just maybe, we are butt dialing the Universe and don't realize we are the true source calling into our lives those things we do not want. Lipton suggests that there is a way to call into our lives exactly what we do want. And, it begins with what we choose to believe. I think most of us already knew that, but I do recommend this book because it is very interesting to me to hear this truth from a biologist. He is an entertaining teacher, too.matter of fact, after writing this review, I now believe I found his book because I made a call.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I think this is one of the best superhero movies I've seen. There are a lot of great action scenes, funny one liners, and is very entertaining. The audio and visual effects are also fantastic if you have a nice surround sound system.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is book 2 of the Century Trilogy, and follows the children of the characters in the first book (along with some of the original characters too) through the second World War, the rise of Nazism, Communism and The united States' involvement and the creation of the United Nations. There's a lot of historical data but the personal interactions of these characters brings everything together in an epic novel by the Master Storyteller, Ken Follet. Like I said, Absolutely Awesome!
B0091XRL86|1.0|We have family movie nights and this movie was picked with some doubt based on the trailer.  Should have gone with that feeling.  I read some if the reviews and based on that, decided to rent it.  Waste of money and waste of a night watching this movie.  It was not interesting, the jokes were bad as well as the story line.  We kept watching it, hoping it would get better.  It did not.  If I could have given it zero stars, I would have.  Parents, don't waste your time or money on this one.  I don't know how it received any good reviews?  This movie was one of the worst I have seen in years.
B0071LLHGC|1.0|The low rating is not for the recorded show but is for the opportunistic attempt to profit by selling this bootleg, which is easily available for free on the internet.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I am so happy to have the app! It works so much better than opening in a web browser. Sometimes I get kicked out or it won't load on the first try--but I am very pleased with it otherwise!
0061692042|4.0|This book was so good, as in descriptive, interesting, elusive characters, but it just never really grabbed me.  You couldn't help but love the main character, but you wanted someone to set a fire under him to get him going.  However, there were times when I felt, if only we could all be a little more like Dell and stay so positive despite so many obstacles against him.  Good read, for sure!
B002WY65VU|5.0|More in the same vein (get it - vein?) of \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" than \\"Night of the Living Dead.\\"  The gore here is fairly minimal, but the camp is in high gear.  Apart from the valuable lessons for surviving the zombie apocalypse (\\"don't forget the double-tap\\"), Woody Harrelson (who I normally don't much care for) turns in a great performance, as does Bill Murray in a small cameo role.  Big guns, big SUVs, and lots of action make for a great lighthearted zombie evening.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I have read lots of Folletts books and this is another one that I enjoyed. Lots of history about getting into World War I, how the characters portrayed their countries at the start of the war. I was never a history buff, and am not now, but I have learned alot>
B009JBZH54|5.0|Don't want the extra stuff and just the actual movie this is PERFECT!! No spending extra for behind the scenes whatever, just the movie enjoyment and at such a great price, can't miss!!
B008J344BQ|5.0|As always P!nk rocks, This album is even better than her previous ones. Every song is amazing!! caution even the clean version is not for listening to around kids.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|My wife loves her Kindle Fire.  It's goes with her, everywhere.  I have only caught a glimpse of it but have never actually held it or been allowed to push any of the buttons.  She also loves the Kindle cover.  It allows her to browse, hands free, without having to look down at what she is reading.  I think that everyone should have a protective cover for their expensive hardware and this one seems to be rugged and well designed.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|It took me a while to watch this movie, maybe because I read the book<br />first.  Big mistake!  Another example of a great book and a mediocre<br />movie.  I do not understand all the fuss about it, and even how<br />this movie has raised the interest in archery in the USA, and probably<br />around the world.<br />Both the movie and the book have a great story behind it, and although<br />it is a trilogy, it does not give you that feeling at the end.<br />The brutality of the book is covered as best as possible in the film<br />(I guess to make it PG13).<br />Still, it is a good movie to watch, and since it is going to be the<br />beginning of a trilogy that you will hear about in the next years,<br />you have to watch it.
0310263662|5.0|This video is very touching and brings out the Suffering of Jesus Christ and the treatment He received by the religious people of His time.  It is based on the Biblical readings of the Holy Bible.  It is very touching and i can't even imagine having to live in those times when such unjustice behavior was the norm.  I would recommend this DVD to those who would like to see the cost that was paid for their lives.
B003K16P3M|5.0|rhis book is probably the best book i have ever read. it is well written in full detail and i recommend anyone else  to read it .
B004UID2LC|3.0|it was good until the last update and now I can not watch anything and that stinks so pleese fix the glich
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thought it was going to be heavily into BDSM, but it wasn't. I really like the main character because she was strong and real.
B006LSZECO|5.0|So smart and a great twist I did not see coming. I jumped right into another one of her books because I love her
B00843MCO2|5.0|I started reading WOOL after finishing the 'Game of Thrones' books. It is quite a different book, but easily on par or greater in terms of creativity of the setting.<br /><br />I do not like to give anything away about the premise of a book, and I will not change my tradition here. For a few dollars, buy it, enjoy it and get caught up in it!<br /><br />Ever since I started reading it I have told at least a dozen people they need to read it as it can appeal to anyone, not just SciFi readers.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love love love pinterest. I cant get enough of it its like legal crack. pinterest is to women as fantasy football is to men.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|A friend recommended this free app of the day.  After playing it awhile, I would  recommend it for purchase to anyone!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool Omnibus is one of the best best books I have read.  The characters are believable and the story got me hooked from the beginning!  Mr. Howey has written a series that leaves you wanting more!  His focus is spent on fleshing out the main characters nicely and you find yourself cheering for their success.  I will definitely be reading the rest of this series.  I recommend this series to anybody no matter what type of genre you like!
034580404X|5.0|Once I started reading these books I could not put them down. I do not recommend these books for teens. I hope the author does continue writing about Fifty. I read all three books in 5 days. I hope others buy and read these books, and enjoy them as much as I have. I have passed them around to several different people and they enjoyed the as much as I did.
B005K17RU0|4.0|works well.  saved the cities that i frequent so i can use it when i travel.  i like the options
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Being a parent of a child who has been bullied this book spoke to me from the start. It should be mandatory reading for all middle school age children. Spoken through the voices of all of the main characters it truly lets you understand what it feels like not only to be different but also how it feels to be connected to that person.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Fast read...a reminder of our need for the \\"strongest\\" military in these days. Men an women who willing give it all for our saftey. Shame on anyone who would choose to elect Obama for another 4 yrs.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Not only does it have different versions, but it will also read it to you as you study!!! I would recommend this to anyone who wants multiple versions at their fingertips!!!! A+++
B0064W65SO|5.0|Great story.....you see Commissioner Gordon like you never have before!  Tells the origin of Batman and how he became the hero we all know.
B0063GORYU|4.0|challenging and fun.  I like to play the 2 suit game. I play it everyday until I win at least once.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I loved this book so much! I can‘t wait to read the next book. Love this seires totaly going to read the rest of the sieres

B007THA4FI|5.0|The story was great.  She paints a very believable and poignant story.  I felt like I was there going through it with them. Its definately a book I will pass on and read again.
B007SGM084|5.0|Whoa! Incredible read. It's not just an erotica series but the story line is much deeper than I ever expected. I couldn't put my kindle down. So happy that I got all three books at once instead of one at a time.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Kindle for Android at least gives me the opportunity to read my Kindle books when I am waiting in a line or at a restaurant awaiting service or food. Although the display on my phone is not as large as my Kindle Fire it is still very readable and the program seems to work just fine with my Samsung Nexus
1423424514|5.0|This is the sixth, truly improved edition of the standard of standards, The Real Book!<br />This smaller format is still clear to read, much more manageable and it offers and indecent amount of knowledge.<br />Great book!
B004132HZS|5.0|After seeing screen shots and gif images from the show countless times on my tumblr dashboard, I've finally been convinced to watch this show.<br /><br />My feels.<br /><br />My otp.<br /><br />My ships.<br /><br />My feminine boner.<br /><br />It was then I realized there was never a choice for me.  Yes, the queen of England DID declare all males in the UK to be super attractive.  It's unique. It's different. It's a damn good series. But you really don't have to take my word for it. If you're not already into 20 minutes into the first episode already, AT LEAST 20 minutes then you're not ready for this type of fandom yet. go back to watching Honey Boo Boo. As for me I will be waiting impatiently for season three of Sherlock.
B009KHCT94|4.0|Great comedy with lots of action and the special effects were better that I would have expected from a non Hollywood production.<br /><br />Wish a lot more of the scenes were left in that I saw on some of the on line previews before the movie was released for U.S. viewers.<br /><br />Nice to see a fresh and creative entertainment product that does not fit the standard mold.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Great movie, it did not disappoint. Full of action and has comical points here an there, husband stayed awake for the entire movie even on his second time watching (long work hours and normally sleeps half way through movies). Quick pace and great character choices. Five Star Movie
B001QVFDA4|4.0|Great cast, great story.. if you liked snatch its for you.<br />I liked the story line and was also very funny with a bit of a dark side.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I thought this book was a great one and I recommend everyone to read it because it was so great. All around just a good book.
B004XXIHS2|5.0|The suspense is nerve-tautening and totally unexpected.  I could not put this extraordinary novel down. The trouble will be finding a new read that will measure.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This is so much fun.  Didn't know some of my friends were so creative and a few not so much.  A few words were harder than I thought they should be. I find I do more doodling now.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|I am new to the whole Kindle fire thing,I had ordered a case and it did not fit. I mistakenly ordered the old kindle fire one. So for awhile I was holding the kindle to watch a movie. After I got the right one What a difference. Works great for me!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Not usually into military books but this one is different. Can't help but have a new found respect for Navy Seals and the rest of the armed forces.  Would recommend this book to everyone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am one of those who watched the movie first before reading the book.  The book was so much better than the movie.  The book goes into great detail.  I couldn't put the book down.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I like this just a more then 50 shade of gray, which I read 3 time.! I can not wait for the next book 3 to finish the story.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This is a disarmingly charming book.  It explores a marital relationship that has frazzled itself into a comatose state, the prejudices and selfishness of bystanders and media participants, and the ways in which people try to find meaning in their lives.  Harold Fry's journey is one of self-discovery and introspection.  His inherent decency keeps him from being overwhelmed at the various turns in his path and protects him from what might otherwise have been dangers to him.  Harold and his wife independently come to realize how their inability to communicate with their own deepest feelings and with each other has maimed their lives.  At the end of the novel and the end of the journey, I felt that I had a better grasp of my own journey.  Thank you to Rachel Joyce for this touching experience.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I am really liking this follow up album from Mumford and Sons. It is very catchy. I would recommend buying this album.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|loved the movie. all heroes together was great to see lots of action fun scenes good image played well. I would watch it again cause it was entertaining
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Finally able to get on my kindle fire!  It works great and plays smoothly. Cannot seem to put it down...addicting
B009QW7HMC|5.0|I've been watching this show religiously since the beginning.  Season 2 was a little slow, but it was ok.  This episode promises the beginning of a great season.  I can't remember the last time I saw a horror movie that I really liked.  This episode is everything that a horror movie or show should be.  The feeling of suspense that I felt while watching kept me on the edge of my seat.  Also the depth of the characters is incredible.  I just wish that there were more tv shows like this out there.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|I thought this book was closer to what I expect from Michael Connelly, and his Harry Bosch character.  Harry and the entire police department have no reason to care about the deceased, and should just say, \\"Good riddance\\".  That is not the person that Harry Bosch is, because early on, (in other Bosch books), we learned that, with him, \\"everyone counts, or nobody counts\\".<br /><br />The victim is an attorney, that has made his living suing the police department, and individual officers.  Due to LA's history of race riots, and the fact the deceased is black, the force wants to tread lightly, and hope they do not unleash another round of riots, while trying to figure out the culprit.  If it turns out to be one of their own, it will leave another, so called, black mark, on the department.<br /><br />While Harry can understand this, he doesn't seem to cater to the races, nor to those trying to.  He treats all the same, and lets the chips fall with the truth.  And yes, in the end, there will be consequences, but in a way, these were well deserved.

B00973DDN2|3.0|At first, I was a little disappointed with this album. After listening to it a bit more, it kind of grows on you. I still don't think it is as good as past albums by the Killers. I would recommend borrowing it from someone.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|Re: ASIN: B006BGZJJ4 This cable is a totally inferior product. I received it today. It failed within the first recharge of my Kindle Fire, even after restarting recharging by wrapping the cable over the Kindle to effect contact, in which I got some life for only 5 minutes. I've had similar problems with other earlier purchased Amazon cables. However, none have operated so poorly as this newly purchased product. Amazon obviously hasn't the time to assure it's selling a workable useful product.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Using this for the interface between TO-3 transistors and aluminum heatsinks in some QSC and Peavey Professional amplifiers. No overheating under load and no damage to the components. After 30 years of service, some of the original devices gave up, so instead of throwing the amps away and buying new stuff, I decided to fix them myself. The old transistors had what looked like thermal paste on them, but it was now sand. I needed some new stuff. I've used Artic Silver on all my CPUs and never burned one up yet so I knew it would be more than adequate for the amplifiers. New transistors (Toshiba and Motorola) came in and new paste went on. Flawless. Very happy with the paste and the amps. It is good enough to use on more than just computers.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|What can I say the title says it all.. (Note there is going to be spoilers in this read at your own risk) Well the movie starts out with a couple of scientists finding a cave with Hieroglyphs from which they come up with a theory that said Hieroglyphs are showing not only our creators.. but some kind of a map to their home world.. from here on it goes up and down. Now for my pluses and minuses.<br /><br />+ The basic concept and idea of the story is very realistic.. and has been tried to be explained from scientists and conspiracy theorists(as well as some historians) for years. (Of course non of it is true but let's roll with it)<br /><br />- Basically what you have to believe is we were basically created by something like mutated humans.. (Or maybe advanced) that are basically like us.. unfortunately for the most part.. it seems we were created to be close to lab rats... (Well going by what I saw of this movie anyway)<br /><br />- While the basis of the story is not bad.. (per say) there is some truly terrible mistakes made by the so called Scientists.. not to mention some pretty stupid dialog on occasions.<br /><br />= However seeing as to how we have Millions of Scientists, Historians, Etc. that not only believe something close to this story... but love the idea of being a Monkey's Uncle.. (Well Ape.. and Ancestor possible human origin.. proceeds to roll eyes) along with natural human curiosity.. and yes on occasions..stupidity... (and sometimes just having a really bad day) I actually found this believable.. which is one of the reasons this movie escapes being average or bad.<br /><br />+ This actually has a lot more ties to Alien and AVP then most people think... you get to see an early version.. (Two really) Of Face Huggers(Apparently they to have something like a Queen or at least a Giant.. that originates the Queens.. you'll see what I mean) In addition.. the way the ship is built and where the Live Engineer is found looks close to the Pyramid (Sacrifice Chamber) in AVP.. not to mention the company in the series of movies.. and of course the Robot Crew Member. (Android)<br /><br />= Really while this is Sci Fi.. there is very little if anything scary about this movie.. and there is enough action to get this by.. but really.. it seems long in some scenes.<br /><br />+ The Visuals.. (And really if you are just an average movie watcher and not a fan of Alien these are about the only thing that will save this from being a bad movie for you)<br /><br />So the end result is this... If.. this came out back in the 90's I am sure everyone would be telling you how great this movie is.. even me.. of course I was younger back then.. as it stands now.. this is kind of like a Video Game... you know those Million Sellers.. you heard were the coolest thing since bread and butter.. and you thought it should be by the description.. and the graphics.. then you got your hands on a copy and went What The?? Come to find out the overall game play.. and story is anywhere from Good to really sucking... well that is what this movie is exactly like.. Pending on how well you love the visuals.. and your general exception that yes.. people do/say crazy, wild, and stupid things sometimes will determine how much you like this movie.. Now if you are a true Alien fan.. you must at least watch this once.. it is.. the origin of the Aliens and because of that.. you will probably like this movie.. more so then I did..amber) in AVP.. not to mention the company in the series of movies.. and of course the Robot Crew Member.

B007MG360G|5.0|A great creative game that deserves a try from everyone.Further be told it needs to get more elements to create
B009NPKTN6|3.0|Being a child of the 80's I really wanted to like this movie, but I just couldn't.  The song performances were pretty good and the medley/compilations were well done.  That's the ONLY reason it got three stars instead of the one star I wanted to give.  Rented it for $3.99 and wish I would've waited for it to come out on Redbox.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was disappointed with this book.I didn't even finish it. It is such a shame that the great writer who brought us Harry Potter had to stoop to such vulgar language to write an adult novel. I really expected much more from her. Disappointed!!
B009FOBMBI|3.0|Just a listeners opinion, in terms of their previous work this falls short to me. I immediately noticed the lyrics, and there were several times I cringed upon the 1st listen. I do like the latter songs on the disc as well as \\"Chalk Outline\\" but overall not as good as their previous works. It did take awhile for One-X to grow on me so maybe this is the same, but I don't think so. One constant though is Adam's singing voice, it is just a good as usual.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I really enjoyed this novel,,,at first, i wasn't sure about it, but then i started liking it to the end
B009KHDT0C|4.0|When I was a kid I watched the Dark Shadows soap. I even saw both movies that were made about it, back in the day. I had to see Depp play the role of the Barnibus Collins. The movie was faithful to the old soap in plot and timing. But I realized that the old soap was slow and sometimes boring, and I found myself wondering what I saw in it as a kid. So therefore the new movie, was somewhat the same. It's still worth watching.
0345803485|3.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is the first book in the Fifty Shades Trilogy by E.L. James. When 21-year-old college student Anastasia Steele interviews enigmatic CEO of Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc., Christian Grey, she does it as a favour for her unwell roommate. She's not expecting such a young (27 year-old) attractive man. Grey is apparently attracted to Ana as well. Ana is sexually inexperienced and he warns her off because he is, by his own admission, \\"fifty shades of f***ed up\\", but ends up propositioning her anyway, to become his Submissive. This novel , set over about four weeks, is frustratingly slow moving: if 500 pages = 50 shades of Grey, then it takes 8 shades to get to the first kiss, and a full 25 shades before Ana agrees to sign the Dominant/Submissive contract (although she never actually does). 30 shades to reach a spanking.  I found myself thinking, just get on with it, will you! Throughout, there is rather too much of the blushing and breathlessness and ohhh he's so hot. Ana and her subconscious and her inner goddess spend much of the novel overthinking, overanalysing every word and look. And I sometimes found Ana to be either very naïve or incredibly stupid: did she really think that her experience in the Red Room of Pain, a room filled with implements designed for punishment, was NOT going to be painful? There is some humour and plenty of sex. Literature it certainly is not. Soft  porn ?  Probably. Romance, erotica, yes. Apart from Ana, the characters are rather two-dimensional: after 500+ pages we still don't know why Christian Grey is like this. Although Ana's mother, Carla, does have some sound advice about the complexity of men. Will I invest the time to read another thousand pages of this? Not sure......

B0045XKJBI|4.0|Eclipse is the movie of the third book of the same title in the Twilight Saga series by Stephenie Meyer. The wolves team up with the vampires to defeat the newborn army. Lots of battles between the goodie vampires fighting with the wolves against the baddie vampires. Loved the tent scene. Dakota Fanning is chilling as Jane. Robert Pattinson still doesn't know how to do more than wince or frown. Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black just gets more & more gorgeous.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch has proved once again he is a master of words touching our hearts.  Time is such an ordinary, yet elusive factor in our lives.  The story weaves in and out like a beautiful spider web bringing us all together minute by minute.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This book is so bad on so many levels.  If I had it to do over, I'd have saved my money for a better book and a deserving author.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you read Bared to You, you HAVE to read this one too! Syliva Day kept the romance in the story but made it almost into a mystery/action novel as well. She did a great job with another great cliff hanging ending. I can't wait for the third one!!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|This series is outstanding for it's revisualization of the classic Doyle story lines.  While the excellent production values beginning with the feature length treatment are outstanding, the casting is some of the best I've ever seen. They have really raised the bar for TV.  I couldn't imagine anyone else as Sherlock or Watson.  If the next season is even as good as the first two, I am going to be one happy viewer.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is the perfect book, in my opinion. It's beautifully written, poignant, thoughtful, funny (at times), relatable, and (most importantly) so so very honest. John Green paints a world that you feel apart of...where you cheer on Hazel's victories and you cry with her during her losses. It's a book about falling in love that actually makes you fall in love; with the characters, with the writing, with the plot, and with so many of those tiny quotable nuggets that you find yourself carrying around with you even after you've put the book down. I had been told to read TFIOS since it came out, and I'm upset that it took me as long as it did to finally pick it up. I finished it within 4 days (it would've been 1, but I'm a full-time student, hah.) While it's technically a 'young adult' novel, anyone can relate to it. I cannot praise this book highly enough!
B006TRTKJ0|4.0|The DVD of the Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is based on the book of the same name by John Boyne. The basic story is that of Bruno, the naïve and innocent son of the camp commandant of a Jewish concentration camp (Auschwitz). Bored with the lack of playmates, Bruno goes exploring and finds a boy in striped pyjamas on the other side of a high fence, and makes friends, with tragic consequences. The movie follows the basic tenet of the book, but differs on some minor points, (certainly, Shmuel looked less like a starved Jew than Bruno did). The scenes are well-acted, and Asa Butterfield played his role of Bruno especially well. I found the plummy English accent a little off-putting. It has a dramatic, Hollywood-style ending.

B005HJWWW8|4.0|The unit is a mighty marvel.  I needed amplification for portable earphones.  This unit is about 2 inches square and 1/4 inch thick (5 cm square by 7 mm thick).  It charges from a USB port with a cable that comes with the unit.  You can charge the unit while it is in use or run it for hours on a fully charged battery.<br />  There were two male-to-male extensions for the subminiature cable (standard for small earphones).  You simply plug one end of the cable to the sound source and the other to the input port of the Filo E6 Headphone Amplifier.  Your headphone goes into the output port.  Slide the off-on switch to on and a blue light tells you that the unit is on.  Adjust the volume and you are in business.  It gives a clear sound -- no static -- and you can make some adjustment to the equalization (quality).<br />  It is a nicely designed device in a small package.<br />  I use the device so that I can hear people who speak softly on the telephone when my telephone amplifier can not give enough amplification.  It does the job.

B008QTVNUI|5.0|I had heard this was a good series, but I had no idea just HOW good.  When I started watching, I couldn't stop. Suffice it to say; nothing got done around my house until I had completed the entire season.  It was so good, I subscribed to the Showtime channel so I wouldn't miss any more shows.<br /><br />Awesome writing, acting and storyline!
1572816295|5.0|Charming, fae, sweet... These are all words that have been used to describe the Paulina Tarot, drawn by Paulina Cassidy and published by U.S. Games Systems, Inc. and they are all true, but there is more to this deck than just that.<br /><br />My account at Amazon tells me I have had this deck since March of 2009, and I instantly bought one for my aunt, a budding collector and reader in her own right, because I found it so adorable and the colors so lively, which should speak highly of the deck, but it had never made its' way into my regular reading rotation until recently.<br /><br />Before I took the deck and and actually began to read with it I believed that the images, while charming and gorgeous, were too similar, too samey-samey to offer good readings.  I purchased some prints for my daughter's room, leafed through the cards occasionally, but that was it.  I now know better.  This surprising little deck is not just fairies and pretty things.  It's sweet exterior hides a tough core and some sharp little teeth.<br /><br />This charming reading, including the Magician, the Ten of Swords, and the Tower, heralded the onset of one of my worst anxiety attacks to date, and then my husband went in for an emergency surgery.<br /><br />But I can't hate a deck that was just telling me like it is, nor one that has my all time favorite Hierophant card, which is an oft maligned card that should be about our connection to God and where we all find divinity, whether that looks the same or not, and it should be a card that offers wise and good counsel, and encourages to follow our own traditions.  Unfortunately, it often becomes a card that becomes about our disappointments and discomfort with organized religion and authority figures.  I feel this image goes far towards salving those wounds.<br /><br />The Paulina Tarot is a 78 card deck that features standard Major Arcana, with Strength at 8 and Justice at 11.  The Court Cards are Page, Knight, Queen, and King, and the suits are the standard Wands, Cups, Swords, Pentacles, so no surprises there.  It is based on the Colman Smith deck, but not enslaved to it.  There are lots of quirks to this deck that make its' voice unique, and the colors are gorgeous.  For intuitive readers, there are plenty of symbols to grab a hold of to read, and lots of play between the colors.  The cards interact and have a great storytelling ability to them.  The packaging includes a tuck box and Little White Book, and the cards have been printed in China on lovely stock without a hint of shine to it, and the cards themselves are a good size at 2.75\\" x 4.75\\".  I am a huge fan of the U.S. Games decks that have been printed in China, as the card stock is divine and the colors are lovely, as well as being less pixelated.  (If anyone from U.S. Games is reading this, can we get a Hermetic from China, pretty pretty please?)<br /><br />My experience with the deck has been that the readings are straight forward and really hold no punches.  If you are going to ask the Paulina a question, you had better be sure you want to hear the answer!  I also found my biggest concern, that the images may not be distinct enough to offer good readings, was entirely unfounded.  This deck positively sang in my hands, and I had no head scratching moments with it at all.<br /><br />I feel people to new to tarot would enjoy this deck, and the images are not scary at all, with no nudity or violence.  I feel experienced readers with a leaning toward whimsy or fanciful, somewhat fussy fae will enjoy the imagery, and intuitive readers that like to have many things to work with on the card should enjoy the expressive pictures as well.e the standard Wands, Cups, Swords, Pentacles, so no surprises there.

B006YXTRHY|3.0|Breaking Dawn Part One is the movie of the first half of the book of the same title in the Twilight Saga series by Stephenie Meyer. Bella has finally agreed to marry Edward and he's finally agreed to turn her into a vampire. She obviously has rocks in her head. Beautiful wedding orchestrated by the lovely Alice. Edward with a bit more colour, although not in all scenes: sometimes he looked human, sometimes hit with the excess white makeup. He actually smiles a few times. Then the super-speed pregnancy, with Bella looking like a cancer patient by the end. Baby Renesmee born, Jacob imprinted, Bella converted on point of death, looking like death and then magically looking beautiful again. Far too many song interludes. Jacob should lose the facial hair.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I was really looking forward to reading J.K. Rowling's new book, but I have to say I was a little disappointed.  I thought the story plot was pretty good, and of course she does a wonderful job of developing her characters, but I was really turned off by all the swearing in the book.  I am by no means a prude, and I don't mind some swearing if it enhances the story.  But I just felt like a lot of it was not necessary and didn't add anything to the story.  I gave the book 3 stars because of the swearing and because I had the ending figured out about halfway through the book.
B007THA4FI|5.0|If you like Maeve Binchy or authors such as Rosamund Pilcher (which I do) yet hunger for something a little less vapid you will love this book.  Similar to Binchy and Pilcher, Rowling uses a small village as a backdrop and bases her novel on the relationships woven among its inhabitants.  However, Rowling seems to infuse more colour, depth and realism into her characters. Some are crude but so are many in real life.  Harry Potter was a brilliant children/youth series but to try and compare this to that is a most unfair comparison.  This should stand alone and be judged on its own merits.

0670498785|5.0|I discovered this author not too many years ago, and only wish I had discovered his books sooner. I couldn't put this book down. Mr. Durrell has a wonderful sense of humor and a lovely perspective I feel privileged to share while reading his books. Such a unique writer with a real gift for telling tales in a fascinating, beautifully articulate manner. His command of language is enviable and, unfortunately, very uncommon in this day and age.<br /><br />After buying multiple copies of \\"My Family and Other Animals\\" for myself and every person I know who might share my enthusiasm for Mr. Durrell's writing, I began to read some of this prolific author's other titles. Witty and wonderful! Also recommend \\"The Overloaded Ark\\".<br /><br />Gerald Durrell is a treasure!

B0071XO8RA|4.0|Howey has created a very interesting plot structure but his prose is only so so.  I hope he keeps writing and becomes more of a master with character development and language.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|&#34;No Easy Day&#34; is a genuine thriller that provides the rare nail-biter. It's also one of the best books of the year. Written by ex-Navy SEAL Mark Owen (whose real name I will not mention for his own safety) he chronicles the manhunt for Osama bin Laden. In the book,  he explains that he was one of the men who fired bullets in bin Laden and helped carry away his body. From the beginning to black hawk crash to the final moments in bin Laden's bedroom, &#34;No Easy Day&#34; is both thrilling and terrifying. I had an breathtaking time.

My father served in the navy in the pacific and one of my uncles was in Europe and flew on bombers over Germany. It was enlighting to understand what was taking place for those who lived in Europe. I enjoyed this book very much and liked that the characters in the first book continued on with the next generation.

B00007KWHP|5.0|This album should have been titled \\"Rock Solid\\". Even remastered,this CD almost sounds as good as my original vinyl and cassette copies.  YES !
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is the greatest superhero movie ever!! I dont want to even hear comparison to \\"The Dark night rises\\". This movie has a hulk!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|who ever plays this game is awesome that's why I named it awesome game. Hope you love it. Bye Bye . love ella
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Amazing book . so ready for the house of Hades! must read worth every penny ! every detailed and action packed , Rick did a great job and I cant wait to see how the prophecy of the seven turns out !
B007THA4FI|2.0|I had no expectations.  I was sure it would be nothing like the Harry Potter series, so in that I was not surprised.  I was suprised however at how hate-full of a story it was.  I hated every minute of reading it, yet I kept reading because I wanted just one good thing to happen.  If JK Rowling writes another book, I will read it, but I am sorry I read this one.
B009HNCS9M|3.0|Crimanal minds is my favorite show. This was a good episode but not one of the best. I totally miss Emily Prentiss. She added another character to the family.  The video and sound on my Kindle Fire(the original) was great! Nothing wrong with the product! Thanks,  Deanne
B003VJTGLQ|5.0|Kevin Spacey is a great actor and this movie is one of his best (Next to The Usual Suspects) and this should be part of everyones movie library. If you dont like this movie there is something wrong with you and you need to fix yourself..
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book once again from Rick Riordan. As you progress through the chapters you just can't seem to put the book down as you need to know what happens next. Unfortunately now that I have finished this so quickly, I have to wait a year to find out where book 4 is taking them.
B007VT6QSI|1.0|This edition only brought the CD, I believe that if it is an edition of luxury it must bring the dvd but I come near only the CD without the dvd
B00979OL5A|5.0|awsome game play like the graphics i can play this game for hours you can never get bored because of all the different levels there is to prince of persia
B001BANK32|5.0|I read The Shining after seeing the movie three times.  The movie's only saving grace was Jack Nicholson's chilling performance. Otherwise it was hard to follow.  They definitely butchered the story. The book is much more satisfying, and I plan to read it a coup-le more times to catch up with the movie.
B00101ZOTA|5.0|Do I really need to even bother writing this review right now. It's a friggin classic. Great movie, great actors/story/everything. If you havent seen it then get out from whatever rock you are hiding under and rent it/buy it/steal it but just see it. It is GREAT!!!!!
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|This movie will fill your quota when it comes to an action movie, but will fall a wee bit short on story line. But it is well worth the rental fee.
B004GYY714|5.0|Tunein is the best! It allows you to listen to a various of music, from different cities/States! I live in NY! They took Michael Baisden off of radio. Through Tunein, I can still listen to his show!<br />THANKS TUNEIN! You are the best!!!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This product was exactly what i was looking for. I can find my files transfered to my kindle with ease. Love it.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This is the first Lee Child novel I have read.  It was excellent, and I plan to buy more in the future.
B008S4YZCO|3.0|this is sucky. every time I try to get in the game it gets right back out. it worms the second time but this gets very frustrating. also to get out of the game I have to hit the menu on the game. this is bad because I am changing apps a lot and having to wait is not my thing.
B0014EAN8K|5.0|Action and suspense fans tend to get bored with their own favorite genre, and then rate good movies low, because they did not give them something new. Look, chocolate ice cream is what it is. Do not ask it to be strawberry. Lots of action and suspense. Great movie.
B009329ZF2|4.0|I had a great time watching his movie as it had lots of action and battle scenes. There were some impossible parts to it with the battleship. But Again, it was an action movie and cannot be rated on realism.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|The other reviewers have covered the plot.  I loved this book for two reasons.  One, John Corey is back with the sharpest sense of humor in a very long time.  I was cracking up as I was reading a novel of a very deadly subject...that of Al Qaeda in Yemen.  I appreciated very much the time DeMille took in laying out the complex structure and lack thereof, of the Yemeni society.  Even though some may feel that that socialogy lesson interfered with moving along the plot to John blowing someone away, it aided me in understanding the situation we are dealing with.  Obviously, the Panther was modeled after Al Awlaki, our own home grown terrorist vaporized by our drones.  I did have one issue with the plot...the CIA and their involvement with the fate of Kate and John.  When I started to realize where DeMille was going, I wasn't thrilled with it.  But DeMille has dealt the CIA a few back hands with his other books and it makes me think DeMille doesn't have much trust in our loyal \\"spooks\\" or they just make for a great foil. I'm sure Mr. DeMille (I'm ready for my closeup now.  Sorry.  Wrong DeMille) would appreciate me saying that this would make a great gift for the upcoming holidays. But then John might just nuke me if I don't...
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved the book,  she writes well and kept reading to see how eva and cross would work ot their problems
B008Y778ZG|3.0|This movie is not the best world apocalyptic movie I have watched, but the acting probably is. It has a world-class cast that execute their parts perfectly. There are a few parts in the movie that I believe could've been written better, but overall a good movie.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|I have loved this movie since I first saw it on cable tv years ago. The interweaving of these women's lives is so true for many of us women. You will enjoy the twists and turns in these women's lives. It is a joy to watch!!
0374275637|5.0|[[ASIN:0374275637 Thinking, Fast and Slow]] by Daniel Kahneman is an important book that will change the way you think about the way you think and make decisions.  Kahneman, a psychologist who won the Nobel Prize in Economics, discusses the two kinds of thinking that we do, which he labels System 1 and System 2.  System 1 is fast, automatic, and essentially unknown to our more conscious minds - the System 2 thinking that is logical, slow, and rational.<br /><br />Kahneman and others, especially his close collaborator Amos Tversky, have done a lot of research exposing the biases in the way we think.  I enjoyed his summary of their work and I especially enjoyed the descriptions of their \\"arm chair\\" science, although much of it was actually done while Kahneman and Tversky were walking and talking, which was later confirmed by experimental research.<br /><br />They found that we are inclined to avoid mental effort, including the effort of paying attention, and use lots of shortcuts to form impressions and make decisions.  Many of these cognitive shortcuts violate the assumptions of classical economics, which is why their work is so important to Economics.  Kahneman writes clearly and well about the different kinds of cognitive bias and what (if anything) can be done to make better decisions in the face of our cognitive biases.  His discussion is wide-ranging and covers such things as anchoring and framing, the law of small numbers, regression to the mean, overconfidence, the trouble with rare events, and the importance of stories for life satisfaction.<br /><br />This book is definitely worth reading - highly recommended.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|this game was awesome the story was cool how you play as the pigs I had a lot hoof fun playing this game
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I have to say if you've read 50 Shades, this book is light years beyond that. The writing is so good you feel like you're in NYC in the Summer. The plot is also so much more of everything. If you liked 50 you'll be blown away by this book. Don't even hesitate to buy it.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Charlize makes the movie works, except for that... Kristen Stewart makes any movie be boring, this girl can't show any emotion, is unbelievable.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I found the Harry Potter books hard to read, but I enjoyed this book very much. A great cast of characters with a great story.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|As calculator go this is by far the easiest one I used.  I also like the fact that I can actually see the numbers.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Not at all what I expected.  Can't believe it was written by JK Rowling.  I wasn't looking for Harry Potter, but never expected this either.
0393327345|5.0|Loved the movie, wanted to experience the book. Glad I did. The book I think gives more clues about the big revelation in this story, while the movie interpretation, by the very virtue of being a visual medium, hides the secret plot reveal more effectively. Also read \\"Haunting\\" by Chuck and was vaguely disturbed by it, wouldn't say I enjoyed the read, but interested enough to finish it. I like this book much better as it is less gruesome and more compelling story. I like the writing style, and the story is surprisingly rich for how short it is.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|It seems Sylvia Day does everything she can to try to ride on E.L. James' coat tail. And fails. She would have done better to just try to create her own story. Instead, she spends her time regurgitate the characters & events of Fifty Shades of Grey back in this book. Shame on your Sylvia Day.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|I was worried old Tom would be trying to push the acting too much. Not the case. Great long movie which leaves you at the edge of your seat. Recommend purchase. Throw it in your cart and wait for it to drop.
B00770KR7W|3.0|When comparing the previous versions of the Halo Master Chief figures from the Anniversary Series, this newer version seems a bit thinner and top heavy.<br />This one seems more flexible than previous versions and has good hip and shoulder rotation, the guns fits nice in the hands.<br />The feet are too small and he can not stand up without help or tricky balance of the feet and legs position.<br />The Series 2 Master Chief has much better armor and has bigger feet so he can stand up.
B00028HBKM|1.0|If your eye offends  thee pluck it out.  something like that.  After the first ten minutes i wanted to dig my eyes out.  compleat trash.  People/ parents/ schools/ churches that took their kids to see this horror show should have been arrested for child abuse.  Even the film \\"Blood sucking Freaks\\" was not this big of a torture show.  Do yourself a favor. Rent \\"JC Superstar \\"  and \\"Godspell.\\"
1439153663|5.0|I literally could not put this down.  Finished at 4 in the morning.  Wow, such a compelling story.  I hope there is a sequel because it doesn't seem like it's done!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved Gillian's writing style, much the way my own mind works. I don't give away spoilers, but I will say I wish it had ended a little differently.<br /><br />But don't let that keep you from reading Gone Girl. The characters are truly some of the most developed I have seen in a long while and Gillian loves to make you think you know the entire plot, but there are surprises at every turn!<br /><br />Amy and Nicks relationship is so incredibly disfunctional, just like so many of us!<br />You won't be disappointed.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Tonight is the 2nd night I've tried this game and I'm well past an hour for 20 levels!<br /><br />What an amazingly simple but challenging game.  It's like being stuck in traffic and trying to find the fastest way home.  You know there's traffic ahead of you but should you continue or hope that one of these side streets that you've never taken will make the difference between eating dinner with the family or stopping off at the drive-thru!<br /><br />What a great idea for a game.<br /><br />5 stars for sure!
0812993292|5.0|I've read most of the reviews, and anyone who has researched the book knows the story line, so I'll just add a couple of observations.<br /><br />This book is as much about the metaphorical pilgrimage of Maureen as it is of Harold's. After all, how could it end the way it does if she didn't also experience a journey?<br /><br />And I've been thinking about the comment that Maureen makes upon meeting her future husband at that dance many years ago. Rachel Joyce leaves us guessing, with only the clue that Maureen's rejoinder wasn't particularly witty and a description of the meeting from Harold's viewpoint half way through the book.  My guess: \\"'ear, 'ear.\\"  Of course it doesn't matter one whit what it was, the point is that they relive that magical meeting in the end.  It's just that it's in my nature to try to solve the puzzle.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|tried to watch on tv, but kept stopping to reboot...aggivating....Finished watching on PC.  not a very good story to start with..$3.99  deffinately wouldn't buy it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|What can i say.I read a book by this author yrs. ago,and when i saw this on the best sellers list i got both of them.Along w/about 5 other books.It wasent one of my 1st reads.I guess i didnt read the reviews.Which i almost always do.But i was going out of town and needed a couple books and was in a hurry.Well let me tell u after i started reading the 1st book i was stuck! I had to finish.Couldnt do anything else until then.This is a must read.One of the best in a long while.Ive been waitng for a couple of my fav authors 2 come out w/their books.This was supposed to just be a fill in.Its not.Its rich,intense,sexy.I now cannot wait until the next in this series!!! One of the reasons this wasent one of my 1st reads on my kindle that wknd was i guess people keep saying if u loved fifty u will love this.Dont get me wrong i loved fifty shades of gray but i had just finished that a couple months before hand.And had my fill. I guess i could say they were similiar,but this is a wonderful series in its one right.I must read for romance fans. Im not going 2 say anything more but buy it:)
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was cool but i think i read too many reviews saying how great it was. I really only thought it was okay. Also, sort of depressing
B006OFN0SE|2.0|Clint Eastwood's \\"J. Edgar Hoover\\" gave me a better idea of why Harry Callahan emerged during the recent Repulican National Convention, and why he did the whole bit with an empty chair.  Clint Eastwood sees a sort of purity in monsters that is not in fact present.<br /><br />For anyone who watched this movie without knowing a whole lot about just who J. Edgar Hoover was should, before crying too many tears for him, check out  [[ASIN:B006OG53X8 Official and Confidential: The Secret Life of J. Edgar Hoover]] and [[ASIN:B003EHB30M Masters of Deceit]].  Leonardo DiCaprio does an excellent, and underrated, I think, of portraying Hoover's vulnerabilities (closet homosexual, an incestuous overdependent), the list could go on and on, but at no point does Eastwood reveal that behind this man of \\"high standards\\" and \\"excellence\\" was also a murderer.  The man who may have found some human understanding in Clyde Tolson, his second hand man (played by Armie Hammer with a touch too much of soft soap) also invented one of the most vicious, racist, and destructive programs ever to emerge from the U.S. Government: Cointelpro.  He had Fred Hampton, a Black Panther in his early twenties, murdered like a dog in his sleep.  He wanted to assassinate Martin Luther King with a passion, but there's no evidence that he had enough power to do it at that particular point in history.<br /><br />What we see on the screen is a young, ambitious, slightly neurotic young man who wants to make his mark on the world and who is absolutely obsessed with control.  We see an old man who was still living in the Cold War.  We see his \\"accomplishments\\", if you want to call them that: the creation of the FBI, fingerprinting, etc etc.  Was Eastwood also secretly sad that Hoover never had a chance to get involved in racial profiling?<br /><br />The performances from Naomi Watts and Judi Dench are phenomenal.  I didn't see any problem with the makeup, as some other viewers had.  I had a big problem, though, with having to look through the eyes of Clint Eastwood regarding this particular monster.  Even his destruction of Emma Goldman's life [[ASIN:1456494872 Anarchism and Other Essays]], [[ASIN:1461078458 Living My Life]] is given a sympathetic treatment.<br /><br />Some parts are funny because you get to watch Hoover jump up and down in front of the mirror whining about how he can't dance with women.  The amusement factor only lasts so long, though, and I question where the heart of old Clint is these days.<br /><br />If Hoover had been raised in Nazi Germany, he would have been Rudolph Hess if not the man with the small mustache.  I recommend this film only if you like character studies of unpleasant (and that's an understatement) figures.having to look through the eyes of Clint Eastwood regarding this particular monster.

B007THA4FI|5.0|Excellent read! Stop thinking about who wrote it and just enjoy it. I'm glad I didn't read it based on the bad reviews I saw before buying it!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Got it on time.  Just in time for movie night with the kids.  Worked great.<br />It is a fun movie for kids and adults.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Very nice - cool twist on bejeweled. this isn't too challenging but like I said, nice distraction.<br /><br />thank you very much...enjoy
B0061PEAUY|1.0|If you are expecting to read a literary work, do not buy this book. The dialogue and its characters are all cliches. Really, the book must have been written in a day. The book is driven only by plot. It reads like a bad TV script -- bad dialogue and a convoluted plot. I should have been tipped off by the many negative reviews. When a book has as many negative reviews as positive, or more negative reviews, it's not good reading. I will not read anything else by this author. She is a mass producing-formula-dirven writer. No literary artist here.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is really awesome so i sugest u get it and u follow me at maddy shay...lol.. ha ha. plz follow me.
B00123JR0I|5.0|Depeche Mode started out as a boy band, I'm almost ashamed to say.  Their first two albums were happy and bouncy, filled with some decent 80's style synth-pop dance tunes.  Although, after Vince Clarke left and Martin Gore took over as the chief lyricist, the songs did start to carry a bit more substance.  Alan Wilder joined and brought with him some intensely dramatic chords and rifts and the band's real sound began to develop.  Some Great Reward was definitely a landmark and I'll never stop listening to it.  But with \\"Black Celebration\\" the band truly detached themselves from their boy-band roots and began to attack some serious issues.  \\"A Question of Time\\" is a classic example: A warning to a 15 year-old girl about men with a driving beat and a foreboding feel to the melody. \\"Well now you're only fifteen. And you look good. I'll take you under my wing. somebody should\\".  \\"A Question of Lust\\" is probably Martin's best song. In it he's trying to convince his partner that he won't cheat on her while he's on tour.  The lyrics are truly an open window to his heart and his beautiful tenor voice is put on display in all of its glory here.  \\"New Dress\\" is probably the best, most politically-charged song I can think of in history.  \\"You can't change the world, but you change the facts.  When you change the facts, you change points of view. When you change points of view, you may change a vote. When you change a vote you may change the world\\"  Terrific song and the one that sparked my interest for all things political. (I now write for a website and feel I owe a lot to this band and this song, in particular.) If you've only heard their later albums (post 1990) You should definitely give this one a listen.  You'll have a new-found respect and love for this band.  If you've never listened to them at all and are wondering which album to start with, this is a very good place!  After 27 years, this is still my favorite album.
B001H4R4LQ|4.0|Pretty interesting work. Has me anticipating reading the final book in the series. Hard to put down. Will definitely read\\" Inheritance\\".
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Great movie!  Love Johnny Depp!  This movie was funny and entertaining.  Definitely not his best work but worth watching.  I give it 4 stars.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Great book! Historical Fiction is one of my favorite genres and this book did not disappoint me. I enjoyed the way the story and characters were developped and the way their paths eventually cross.  I am definitely going to read the next book in this trilogy.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book is a powerful and moving  reminder to appreciate what God has blessed us with ,and the people he has placed in our lives.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|Meh, I guess it was good.... Is there such a thing as too much over the top effects and stuff, maybe?
B000W91RUG|5.0|Started by watching reruns - never even considered it before...what was I thinking?  This is the 1st TV show ever, ever, ever that makes me Laugh Out Loud!  (I Never laugh out loud)  I'm now addicted & watch every chance I can.  Love each, but the \\"Soft Kitty\\" scenes w/Sheldon & Penny...
B008L1PYQU|5.0|Cool to hear the subtle differences in the songs... A welcome addition to any collection.  Nice to still see releases on vinyl!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|This book is very similar to the first one. Questions don't get answered until the very end of the book and it ends with somewhat of a cliffhanger. I'm not very impressed with this series and very tired of Eva starting fights, running away, and it ending with sex. It seems very juvenile and after the 10th time of this scenario playing out I'm over it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Better than the first, cant wait for the third!! Marked it on my calendar!I would reccomend this book to anyone who loves a good heroic love story.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is an awesome application for use with the Kindle Fire.  The use of the entire screen makes this app extremely user friendly.  I highly recommend this application.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I had heard about this book from other people, but was really surprised at just how good it was. You are drawn into the story and characters! I was sad when it was finished...
B006LSZECO|3.0|This was a story with twists and turns, entertaining story of love gone wrong. Details in personality soon helped you to develop an understanding of the story. Crazy girl falls in love with a crazy guy. Did not like the ending as it left me hanging as to what their future might end up to be.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was nowhere near as enjoyable as the Miyazaki movie, but it was great to read the book behind the movie. I couldn't put it down, which is always a good sign. I would recommend this book, but I would suggest waiting until the price is under $5. I feel that I overpaid, but since I enjoyed the book, it was worth the price.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|really enjoy this game. Me and my 3 year old niece that love to set down and play it. I think she like seeing.the coin fall
B0051ANPZQ|3.0|This book seems to be geared toward children in grades 3 through 5.  The main character, Auggie, is a boy about to enter school as a 5th-grader and attend school for the first time.  Auggie has a severe facial deformity and has been home schooled all of his life.  He's about to face the world and the challenges of looking different on his own.  As you might imagine, not everyone he encounters is kind.<br /><br />I liked the author's use of different \\"voices\\" to express not only what it's like to be someone with a facial deformity but what it's like to care about a such a person.  The reader gains insight into not only Auggie's life and experiences but also into how his sister and friends are affected by knowing him.  I would have liked to have heard from his parents also.<br /><br />The book successfully sends the message that it's what's inside of a person that really matters.  On the downside though, it does so in a manner that skips about too much in places and tends to drag in others.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I spend a lot of time playing this game. It is the only game that catches my attention for any length of time. I really enjoy it.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|Not a page turner! I admit I only read half the book. It was a real struggle to get that far. I guess I just didn't get it. I read for pleasure maybe this book has literary merit, but if I could I would ask for a refund.
B007TK77QE|5.0|Excellent. J. K. Rowling has a wealth of knowledge at her disposal. Extremely well written and thought out. Even at the very end, Ms Rowling was still releasing details of the characters that we thought we knew. A sequel would be very welcome!
B008673ZAQ|2.0|Nothing genuine about this book.  It is close to a copyright infringement law suit.  If want to reread Fifty Shades, then  this book is for you.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|its a little hard but its kinda fun once u get really good at it. I like the music too.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Loved this video can't wait for next season. can't imagine what hold Whiskey had on people and how goverment by making a law against it created the crime that consumed so many What a waste of taxpayers dollars. The war on Cannabis is just as costly our prisons are full of drug users because big brother opened the door for more crimanals to prosper and kill for it
B0031QJ5D8|5.0|This is not a movie about death. Death, and Japanese custom surrounding washing and preparing the deceased in the presence of the bereaved family prior to disposal of the body, draws you in with its novelty and gentle dark comedy before subtly transitioning into a study about love.<br /><br />Expect no sledgehammers; the dialogue is Spartan and can hardly be said to be explicit about the real subject matter. I'm not even sure that love is mentioned, but it progressively fills the eloquent silences and transports the viewer into the shoes of the protagonist as his new profession, which initially repelled him, opens him up to his own capacity to empathise with the mourners. Those who have passed on aren't lifeless meat: they have touched those around them--those who are only sad because they are filled with the presence of one so highly vital and valued.<br /><br />Through observing their love, his own ability to love becomes enhanced, and this is why he comes to love his job, why his disapproving wife comes to accept it, and why he eventually becomes reconciled with his estranged father when it is almost, but not quite, too late.<br /><br />It's almost perfect--but could have done with having about 15-20 minutes carefully pruned here and there, especially towards the end. I'd give it 4.75 if I could--but it's as near a 5 as doesn't matter. Watch it. It will help you evolve.

B008FPOIT6|5.0|As a bookaholic, I bought this book just because of the title! The book turned out to be one of my favorite reads of 2012! It has an intriguing story, great characters, funny dialogue, and a mystery that unfolds page by page and keeps the reader engaged. I found myself dreading the last page because I didn't want the story to end. Fortunately, I'm a \\"re-reader\\", so I know I'll visit Mr. Penumbra's bookstore again and again!
B005CUNMYY|4.0|My son told me about this TV show. I loved it from the start. I started to purchase the seasons 1 episodes at amazon.<br />It is so unique how Mike and Harvey work together.<br />I also use I Tunes and looked there to buy each show and again i was amazed. I Tunes price $2.99 per episode.<br />AMAZON price for the same episodes $1.99. Thanks amazon for making my money go a long way once again.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor try one episode of suits and I'm sure you will like it.<br />Do one more favor don't look anywhere else for cheaper prices, amazon.com is the best!
1451696191|5.0|This was a great book. I loved the characters and how they related to each other. You felt for them all and rooted for Charlie the whole book.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Totally amazing book. Could not put it down. Cant wait for the next one! People who loves fifty shades ... grabe this series... much better!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Enjoyed the point of view observations from all the characters. Made the story more compelling. Interested to see how the series concludes.
B0094ZJK4O|4.0|This is a diverse an intensely personal album from Sambora.  There are rockers, ballads and more modern sounding songs on the album.  All of the songs are solid but the highlights for me are the hit Every Road Leads Home to You, You Can Only Get So High, Seven Years Gone, Nowadays, Taking a Chance on the Wind and Learning How to Fly With a Broken Wing.  I always thought he had a better voice than JBJ and he proves it once again on this album.  The guitar work is great as always.  If you like his other solo albums and are a Jovi fan, pick it up, you won't be disappointed.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Yes, I am a grown woman and I haven't met a Percy Jackson book I haven't liked! I am so bummed I have to wait a whole year for the next book-<br /><br />The story is great- I love the intertwining of the new characters and think the story is well written. Love reading these books!
B008AX18Y6|4.0|Life for most people follows usual curve with minimal deviations. Even the most extraordinary of lives, beneath the amazing twist and turns, hides a sense of extreme ordinariness. This is what makes a memoir truly readable and inspirational at the same time.Picked up Salman Rushdie- Joseph Anton with same expectation (Pseudonym with which he lived through the exile, name constructed from the the first names of Polish author, Joseph Conrad and Anton Chekhov), to find a mix of Spy thriller and writer's memoir, though less florid than say, a Maugham or Wilde, but witty at times.<br />Rushdie comes out as a man walking on a thin line during his growing years, staying away from turning a total iconoclast and revolutionary by inches, as he mentions regarding the essay that he wrote on the wily french politician,  Tellyrand (most would chose Napoleon), his support for flagging, against the common sensibility and his downright refusal to join the CCF (Combined Cadet Force) as a way to protest against the imperial rule of British over India. The memoir does not however, attempts to put him on the high pedestal of righteousness as he mentions an incidence of selling off a chair at ballooned price to a class mate in school, Anthony Reed Herbert, who later emerged to be anti-immigrant politician of British National Front, it merely reflects on the development of an individual with absolute clarity of where he stood on various issues confronting him at much early an age, without any significant attempt to tom-tom those positions which he took and held on to tightly, in any public forum, following more or less on the mode of, \\"This is my way, what is your way, there is no THE way.\\"<br />Surely a must read, to understand how individuals stood for upholding greater goal of liberty while nations faltered and sometime buckled.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I finished the book.but there were.moments i could have left it unfinished.  i did not think the writing was exceptional and frankly am not sure what all the fuss is about. author uses the same words and descriptive phrases over and over wearing them out. i would give it two stars and am glad ana left in the end.not sure ill continue with the trilogy.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I've read the other reviews and felt compelled to write something. This album really surprised me as it isn't what I fell in love with Maroon 5 from the first album but who the heck cares. It is a fun album that you can tell they had fun doing. The howling on \\"Doin-dirt\\" makes my 4 year old so happy. I also think the lyrics are very creative. \\"Tickets\\" made me laugh my butt off once I figured out what they meant. Anyway I'm very glad I gave this album a chance. I can see they were making a dance album which isn't my scene but it is still music that makes me smile and sing to in the car. Well worth it!
B007THA4FI|2.0|It was not exciting and it ran on and on. He tried to make the book like everyday life and I was boared stiff.
B007SGM084|5.0|Its a perfect sit in bed at night and read book;) i recommend this book to anyone who likes to read outside the box of normal books.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|it works fine for me.  but i have a very low threshold for what is acceptable in an alarm clock. Does it ring at the time you set it for? Yes, than, that's good enough for me.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|fun matching game with story line. I found it entertaining. not as challenging as other match 3 games and so less frustrating.
B000I9WW0E|5.0|I purchased this for free with the digital  copy code on the Blu-ray version.<br /><br />If you want to play this on a PC or iPhone - awesome.<br /><br />If you want to play this on a Mac or Android - less than ideal and impossible to download the actual copy.
B002V091K2|5.0|The main character is very well developed. The book is very well written (apart from the annoying apostrophes in plurals). It is a page turner of suspense. Well done, Jodi!
B008MEM24S|5.0|This app is a great game for all ages. It challenges you to think ahead to visualize the result. A++
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|My mum and I enjoyed watching this movie about her tour, and how much she cares for her fans. Recommend to her fans.
B008MM9630|5.0|just got the game and so far so good! It is pretty fun and no problems so far :) Keep up the good work
034580404X|5.0|I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but this book made reading my new hobby! This book is very detailed, and makes me have butterflies in my stomach!
B008JAGTNK|4.0|This movie sucks you right in. That's entertainment. So many possibilities in the meanings, well acted scene after scene. Not a chick flick so take your other half !
B0026772N8|5.0|What is quality? This book, every time read. No working knowledge of Zen or Motorcycles  needed to enjoy this gem.
B0086700CM|5.0|WARNING: If you value your social life, DO NOT BUY! This app is like freaking marijuana on a smartphone, iPad, or whatever other snazzy device you have. One run and you're done. There's no going back. You just keep playing, and playing, and playing. Its worse than the Zombie Apocalypse. We may as well call it &quot;The Great App Take Over.&quot; But, even though you just read this, you're probably gonna buy it anyway, which is why I have no hope for society anymore. So, go ahead. Get the app. Ruin any chance you previously had of surviving. Just don't blame me when you find yourself mindlessly playing the game for hours and hours on end.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Good read.  Good series...looking forward to the final book in the trilogy due out in 2013.  This would also make a great movie.
1439102813|5.0|I found Lisa really got inside Alice's head.  It was scary at times and I hope I never get Alzheimer's as I'd hate to lose my memories. Great book for anyone who has to deal with this.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Loved this movie. My daughter was just diagnosed with mild autism (Asperger's) and we enjoyed watching Temple succeed in spite of her disorder.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Very fun game great story line!!!!! Kept me intrigued I couldn't put it down. Can't wait until the next one. I'm a big fan of Big Fish Games!
159420411X|5.0|\\"Wherever there is human judgment there is potential for bias.\\"<br />-Nate Silver<br /><br />That's a quote from an excellent chapter titled \\"Are You Smarter Than A Television Pundit\\" in The Signal and The Noise.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|A little slow starting but soon picks up.The typical trouble finds him,he solves the trouble and bad guys regret it.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|I am a huge fan of Jo Nesbo and the Harry Hole series in particular.  This book does not disappoint.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|This book is just so very well written.  It has a great balance of character discription, background and humor.  I really love the way even the bad guys were somewhat likable.  I think Allan will live on in my heart forever.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I really like this game.  Most of the the time I can figure out how to do it if I dont give up. lol  It really makes me work  for it but is really fun.
B0063IH60K|2.0|The game itself is just a game of solitaire, but what drives me nuts to the point of not playing is all the advertisements that pop up after you finish a game.  Most do not have a skip function and you have to go to the home page to start a new hand.  Drives me nuts!
B004J1DBJI|5.0|I haven't played with it as much as I thought I would, but what I have done with it has been easy, fun and interesting. I don't know what all it can do, so that's part of the problem. It's definitely worth having around, I just need to spend more time with it.
034580404X|5.0|Great easy reading! Couldn't put these books down! I would highly recommend buying the trilogy as opposed to just one of the books. Once you read the first one you won't want to wait for the second or third!
B000GCFY0I|4.0|I found this book slow to get into at first but once you get through the boring beginning of the book it is such a wonderful adventure. Very well written and very interesting.
B0088ZSKOC|5.0|With this application, i am asleep before it is completed.  Follow his instructions and you can \\"feel\\" your body go to sleep.
B0091REZMW|5.0|love it, would love more facebook like this and more hide and seek games that are fun. My kids love this game too.
086571701X|5.0|I am just starting to read this book. Very interesting, good information on how to have healthy vegetables and fish without all the chemicals. Definately will like to try this.
B0091REZMW|4.0|the game is pretty fun but I would like to see harder hidden objects. also would prefer to not have to spend real money
B004N6369Y|4.0|It's a great read - very engaging - but still predictably Danielle Steele. Even the twists are predictable and you know who will be with whom by half way thru!  I'll still read her, because I enjoy the read, but I wish she'd surprise me once in a while!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really didn't think I would like this book.  I usually don't read these types of novels.  I could not put it down!
B007THA4FI|2.0|I kept wanting something good to happen and everything in this book kept going downhill. Maybe I just like a happy ending or at least someone to have a happy ending.  Not a big fan of total depression.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Casual Vacancy is a slice of British life,  the good and the bad, with lifelike characterization portrayal.  An example of great story telling; taking the death of one individual and creating a world from the ripple effects of that death.  What imagination. A world that is not always pretty.  The story seamlessly draws you in and before you realize, you are caring about everyone.  The subtle underlying  commentary of how the system works ( it could just as easily be set in America) because the story works.<br />A great observation of human nature, thought provoking, lifelike,  this is a realistically slice of life, the type that most people do not want to acknowledge, thus creating the very story.  Beautifully crafted.  A reader is left pondering how J.K Rowling always gets it so right!  As another example of her writing chops I say write on!!!  I look forward to her next book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final book in the Hunger Games trilogy is just as enthralling as the first two books in the series. The ending isn't neat and there aren't any fuzzy feelings to be had, but I thought it was a great way to tie everything up. The book felt a bit rushed at times, but it came together nicely at the end. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who liked the first two books.
0785152458|3.0|Can anyone explain to me what has happened to Mark Millar over the past few years? I used to feel like a kid on Christmas morning whenever I got my hands on a new Mark Millar comic. Now I read things like \\"Kick-Ass 2\\" with weary resignation hoping in vain for flashes of the old Mark Millar.
B005H9B2CE|1.0|Very cliche.  Computer graphics demo.  Short on human element, and good lines.  I could not get past the exposition.  Was disappointed, because it was recommended enthusiastically to me.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this series. It captures your attention and keeps it throughout the story. The characters are well developed and I am hoping this is not the end of their story.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|An intriguing book. It is an entertaining look at parts of ancient Egyptian society. It's a good book for young adullts.
034580404X|5.0|Came within perfect time!!! Perfect buy. This was a perfect seller. Woule definitely buy from them again. The books are very good-- long but very interesting to read, and makes u wanna read more.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|This was a cute movie. I really like all the actors in this film that's why I wanted to watch it. It's not a stunner but it's good.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|This book was way over the top. I was laughing out loud out in public & people thought I was strange, but I didn't care & just keep on reading.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|I'm a sucker for an emotional read so when I saw this title on a recommended heart-wrenching book list (I know, why do I do this to myself??!!), I had to give it a shot. The reviews did not disappoint. This book delivered everything I wanted it to. I loved the point of view and the story was believable. My only wish is that the book were longer. I wanted more, perhaps more character development or background story, just more! You can and should read this book in one setting and I am glad I will have time today to read the follow up.
B001A5HBL0|5.0|This series is simply the best. The writers take their time a develop a story!  Treat yourself , start from the beginning of the series.
B009GEOLM4|5.0|Really thought this was outstanding. The Dark Night Returns is the basis for the Batman that we know today. Frank Miller changed the perception of Batman forever with this graphic novel (which I have in plastic bags tucked safely away in the basement) from the smiley happy Super Friends version to the dark tortured soul that we see today. This animated feature does deviate a bit from Miller's vision, but excellent story, excellent voice acting, animation, even the music. This is definitely worth your time and money. In fact, after I rented it, I went out and bought the DVD. Only bummer is that we have to wait a year for Part 2, but this really needed to be longer than the typical 70-80 minute standard format allows for. Hope they keep up the quality in Part 2. Can't wait to see Superman in this story.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is REALLY fun and addicting! Even though you get a free coin every 30 seconds when you play the game, when you are offline/not playing you get a coin every minute or so. :-( That is what they could change.....but otherwise it rocks!
B0094M0DJS|5.0|A well shot movie with an excellent story line. One of the few movies I've enjoyed in a while. I think this movie is \\"prophetic\\"
B000W93CHC|5.0|This saga is an amazing account of life in the 1300's.<br />It is hard to put the book down but the sheer size of it makes it weeks of great literary entertainment. A great read into the hardships of that era and the sickening political climate regarding the nobility and church suppressing the unwashed masses.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Love, Love, the Reacher books.  This one is no exception.  Fast-paced and intriguing.  I dream of 6'5\\" USArmy Major Jack Reacher going commando.  Unfortunately, in this book (and one other I remember) he purchases white underwear,  Oh, well, I guess it was cold.  Tom Cruise in the movies? --- Sacreligious!
B008QTV3X0|5.0|\\"There's a bomb in the brief case!\\" There's a sniper on the roof!\\" These were among the things I screamed at my television. And to be honest, I never scream at my television. The plot moves in a predicable way and yet I was screaming. What a wonderful way to spend a rainy weekend at home. Expensive? Yes. Worth it? Definitely!
1423140605|5.0|I started reading Percy Jackson and the Olympians four years after the first one came out. I  bought the first one and then the next two days later, I liked it so much. Then I finished the series. I was really sad. Then the Kane Chronicles came out and I literally jumped for joy. When I first heard about the Heroes of Olympus series, I bought the first immediately.I loved it. I loved how it was so similar to the Percy Jackson series, yet so different. The only downside of the series is that I have to wait a year between each book.<br />  This book was great, I will definitely be eagerly waiting to get the next one. Especially because of the cliffhanger at the end that leasves you hanging by your fingertips. ;)
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Amazing variety of vocal progressions and sounds. Phantom esk tones and entrancing beats makes this a groundbreaking rock album. Madness and follow me are incredible songs
0307463745|4.0|This is a quick easy read, just what I was looking for.<br />Lots of interesting ideas and I agreed with a lot of them (not all) but a lot.<br />These guys think about product and business very clearly and have defined their own personalities and style of company. Much of what they write about resonates strongly with my own experiences of starting a company with my wife and growing beyond its correct size and then not having fun anymore. We travelled for years after that and found that we were drawn back to business. We have now learned our lessons and we are growing this intentionally and slowly. Basically having reached the conclusions of this book.<br />This book is the opinions of 37signals they are not trying to give you a recipe for success but they are telling ou how they have run their incredibly successfull business without accepting the conventional wisdom and standard models for doing this.<br /><br />Great inspiration<br />Brett
B009KHDT0C|5.0|The actors, all of them, do a wonderful job. Mr Burton has done it again. This is a winner movie to rent while sucking down a few beers late at night. If you plan to buy it, you're an idiot. This film you can only watch once.
B0096C7QF0|5.0|If you love good progressive blues played live by one of hottest guitar players out there, than this is the CD/DVD for you.<br />from start to finish, the only thing that would have made it better is if you had been there live. with a great lineup of guest musicians Beth Hart,John Hiatt and Paul Rodgers. what are you waiting for buy this CD/DVD today!play it loud,play it proud!<br />Rock On!
B00280LYIC|5.0|Excellent story telling so many differences from the movie. My ten year old read this book in three days he could not put it down. Every day after school he went straight to it.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|This Seiko Automatic watch is replacing a 23 year old Quartz Lorus watch that served me well but I grew tired of replacement batteries. Amazon.com made my purchase easy and item shipped mega fast.  I like this Seiko watch alot and I love the band and the large easy to read dial and date.  I shopped around for 6 months before making this purchase, I even considered a \\"vintage\\" watch at a pawn shop. This is the watch for me and I look forward to the savings of time and money in not having to replace batteries.
B008BIN9EW|1.0|Also getting the &quot;app not compatible with your phone&quot; following a factory reset. Previously was installed and working fine. Sprint Epic touch (GS2)
B009KHBDUU|3.0|I was disappointed. With Tim Burton, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, you usually get a good cheeky comedy. This one just didn't do it. There were a couple of good bits, but otherwise, just ok.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected in You visibly displays Eva's raw emotion resulting from her past abuse when she sees Gideon suffering the same torment. The desire to see what happens next made me unable to put down this book. In the end Sylvia Day's characters triumph over their past evils for now. But is love really enough forever? Although Day gives some sense of closure in the end, the reader is aware this is no Jane Eyre and yearns for more.
B008Y78M60|5.0|This was a great period movie for those who like and appreciate movies about the Civil War era with historical origins.  The sheer blatant manipulation of facts, ideas and witnesses during the trial held is mind boggling; but, was what could be expected in a situation and at that time under those circumstances.  Civilians were rarely tried in military court, although it was done.  I know of another instance where a military court pushed through a similar quick military trial of civilians and had them hung for their \\"war crimes\\" as Mary Serrot was hung for hers. You feel like you learn a lot about Mary through her attorney, Mr. Aiken as he goes through the process of trying to prove her innocence.<br /><br />Robin Wright brings a quiet strength to the character of Mary Serrot that is wonderful to watch.  Kevin Kline as Edwin Stanton, Secretary of War is another stellar performance.  Good direction by Robert Redford, once again.  Right on target.  If you are a history buff, like Civil War history or period stories, then you will enjoy this movie.
B00932A2MC|4.0|I am a real sci-fi movie fan, soooo aliem movies are high on my list of \\"must see\\".  I will probably purchase this one.  Excellent special effects, action packed,good visuals.  You will not be disappointed if you are a sci-fi fan.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This site is ridiculously addictive! Every conversation I start begins with &quot;So I saw this thing on Pinterest.........&quot;  I love this site and have gotten many other people addicted as well!
B008OIQYTG|3.0|This is a typical Lee Ritenour recording, jazzy, funky and colorful.  I really like how he doesn't come in on the 'one' of each solo.
0439023513|3.0|I saw the Hunger Games movie on a plane and was really intrigued by the story. When I got home I plowed through all three books in just a few days. I think it gave me a chance to notice the rhythm of the trilogy as a whole. While I was a big fan of the first book, okay about the second book (it had too much explaining in the beginning and then switched into another Games near the end), the last book was annoying and sloppy. I thought it was disjointed and messy. For example, the capturing of Snow was just a summary and there was so much build-up to how was it going to happen. I felt it was an easy way out to just have the protagonist be told after the fact. This happened other times where in pivotal scenes, it then becomes a summary and not really flushed out. Also, what happened to the mother and daughter who were in the house by the lake? its just a shoulder shrug...I don't know, it seems like there were some loose ends. I just was let down for different reasons.
B0088WGBC8|3.0|This movie was entertaining with just enough action with a good pace to keep you engaged.  The plot was pretty good also.  The acting was more than average.  My husband is an action and special effects junkie and he thought it was decent.
B007ZCOT6C|4.0|After a string of bad choices, I decided to listen to the readers from the Good Reads website and downloaded Perfect Chemistry by Simone Elkeles. I was honestly surprised. I thought it would be 'passable' light reading, I could not have been more wrong.<br /><br />The story revolves around a mexican family that moved to Chicago wanting a more fortunate life. Unfortunately the family becomes entangled in crime, and Simones first book in the series explains the families eldest sons struggle against his peers expectations and his growing affection toward a girl from an affluent Chicago family.<br /><br />The story isn't suger coated which I did not find offensive, but realistic and in keeping with the true nature of youth growing up in poverty and crime. The language at times is raw....but its life! its not told in a way that makes you squirm, its told in a way that involves the reader in the emotions and lives of those fighting to be more than society and peer group pressure expects from them.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the story and went on to purchase the following two books in the series. Read the excerpt, you won't be disappointed.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Excellent! I loved all the clues. the backtracking got to be tiring but entertaining game overall. now I want to do the 2nd one
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It's a fun way to pass time!  Always exciting when you can \\"shake\\" a few extra coins into the tray!
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|I was very happy to see that I could open all of my MS Office documents on my phone or tablet.  It was great that I could look at my data while out of the office.  HOWEVER, when I returned to the office and reopened my spreadsheets (Excel), all of the formulas were gone and I had the dreaded \\"#VALUE\\" in place of them.  Yes, they were synced to the cloud with SugarSync so this is partially my fault for not just setting up a different folder that didn't sync.  But the program should not erase everything when opened.<br />Everything else is fine (as long as you remember to use non-synced copies of documents).
B005FUTBWS|5.0|This movie was genius. I loved the drama and action, especially during the climax. The actors were stunning and this movie left me on the edge of my seat. Awesome flick-definitely worth watching!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This is a really interesting book, not just about the death of Osama Bin Laden, but also about the politics of that as well.
B0091REZMW|4.0|its good. very fun game. thoroughly enjoyable without being too difficult. I will play it for hours. objects are not static which makes each visit to rooms different.
B007SGM084|5.0|Couldn't put the book down. Wish there was a little more to the plot than just the bedroom scenes, but over all I was entertained!
B007THA4FI|3.0|A little complicate in the beginning , a fast but interest ending. The bulling came at any age at any time and the result are ........
B004LWZWGK|3.0|After watching the movie sadly the feelings I had wasn't because this was the last of Dark Knight trilogy but that the story was actually the weakest of the three. While it gave us the introduction of the characters of CatWoman and Bane neither of the characters background storylines made them the entertaining characters they are in the comic book series as a major change in their history was done in this movie. Also the actor and actress who were picked for these roles felt spectacular playing them either and seemed pretty subpar especially when you line them up to Liam Neeson or Heath Ledger(R.I.P.) in their iconic Batman character roles.  The movies story felt to rushed like the director/producers/Warner Brothers just wanted to release this as quickly as possible for the summer crowd.  Don't get me wrong the action and effects are spectacular and probably the biggest three stars that at least make you watch the movie from start to finish are Christian Bale,Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman which is a little sad as with the exception of Bale as Batman you don't really care if you miss any screen time that has the two other earlier mentioned Batman nemsis/ally characters which the movie company gave so much PR about.  If you already have the first two movies I say just stick with those and try and pass this one over as a mistake but if you're still interested give it a try but don't be surprised at the feelings of apathy and some disappointment for half the movie.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|Predictable for a sci-fi movie and a bit boring Don't know what all the hype was about Most characters were very bland and lacked any personality Wished I had saved my money and bought something else
B003E88TKS|1.0|I am utterly baffled about the high reviews people have given this movie. It makes me think, \\"what were they smoking?!\\" or \\"who got paid off to write a bunch of fake accolades?\\"<br /><br />I cannot tell you sufficiently as to what a waste of time this movie is because it is truly that bad. But that is not the worst of it.<br /><br />The worst is that this movie will put you in a deep funk. It is truly depressing. There is not a single positive spin, moral or message you can place on it. Suffice it to say there is no happy ending.<br /><br />I have a very intellectually challenging job. I watch movies as an \\"escape\\"  Not only was this movie a terrible waste of my time, it put me in a miserable and depressed mood.<br /><br />I cannot fathom what type of person would like this. I don't care how artsy or avant garde you are in your movie taste. There is NOTHING redeemable about this flick.<br /><br />Waste your time watching something that will not ruin your weekend by putting you in a deep and dark malaise.
0307887448|5.0|Fun book, I read it so quick though, I really wish it was longer. Now it's time for a 90s recreation :)
B007MG360G|5.0|This game is so cool it let's you go up to 135 and 71 .it is free you and you'er children will love it.<br /> And it will teaches you're children different animals.  And different speeches.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Work great well worth the money. Gives the option of unlimited storage for a wifi only ipad. The only negative aspect is that the file names need to be changed before opening them.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It is so nice to always check to see how much you have used your battery for the day. It is always right on. !!!
B002HLM4E0|4.0|I like Amazon instant streaming a lot. I use it very often. The picture quality is good for a streaming service but I also use HBOgo on my Samsung smart tv and HBOgo allows me to enjoy DD5.1 channel sound through my home theatre and here Amazon lacks.
B008FTAAG2|4.0|I have some of their other albums and like them. This one however is the best so far in my opinion.
B007QPFGJW|2.0|Having read all of Nesbo's books, this one was tired and silly. There is a time and place to end character stories and Nesbo could have ended before he wrote this book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Just like Pinterest when I'm on my laptop. The only problem is you cant change your board titles. That's not a big deal though. Everything is so clear. LOVE it!!!
B0091XRL86|4.0|Pirate Captain wants to win the Pirate of the Year award.  The problem is, although he is followed by a very loyal, if somewhat misfit crew, he's just not a very good pirate.  The reasons why his crew loves him becomes obvious as his kind heart and general over looking of everyone's faults, including his own, makes him a fun guy to be around.  Until he meets Darwin who informs him his \\"parrot\\" is not a parrot.  Envisioning awards of gold that will get him to the top in the pirate competition, Pirate Captain sets his sights on winning the scientist of the year award.  Unfortunatel, the queen envies his \\"parrot\\" and soon Pirate Captain is faced with a difficult decision that separates him from his crew and the parrot.  Then he has to redeem himself and save the parrot, while being saved himself.<br /><br />The story line is a wonderful lesson for kids and adults alike with lots of good, clean fun along the way.  There's lots for everyone to laugh at, but it avoids the potty humor so many movies feel like they need to stoop to.<br /><br />The claytronics are superb.<br /><br />I really enjoyed watching this movie with my girls.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book! I give it Five Stars. Very entertaining.  I am looking forward to reading  book two.   I highly recommend it.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I use headphones like this for listening to audio books.  I use my Klipsch X5 in-ear headphones for music.  These are just great for listening to books.  They are light and comfortable - so much so that I really don't notice that I'm wearing them - except for the the voice in my ears!<br /><br />There is one problem only I might have.  My cats love the cords on these phones.  They have chewed up the cords on 3 pairs so far.  I guess they taste good or something since they don't bother with cords on other products - just these!  I'm trying to hide them better.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this game is fun I have it on my phone and kindle and computer my sister has it on her phone too
B00846REIS|4.0|The book isn't particularly written well, but it sucks you in anyway. I read it in one afternoon and then quickly downloaded the next book in the series onto my Kindle.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun. I love how it is free and is challenging. love the graphics- I really like the dice and cup game cud its hard.
B00992CF6W|3.0|If you, like myself, were looking for a portable version of minecraft for pc, you'll be disappointed. While I understood that it wasn't going to be exactly like the main game, I was surprised how limited your inventory and world is.<br /><br />While I surmise that the game will be eventually updated to have a bigger world, more items, etc. at the moment its really only suitable for us who haven't played the PC version of the game. The world itself is only about 256x256 blocks, so really no reason to explore and resources are very limited (sorry no redstone for you...). Also, for me at least, every time I made a world I would be given tiny islands making everything feel even more blah (not to mention that 90% of mobs and beasts are swimming at any given time).<br /><br />However, the controls work once you get used to them, and crafting is a lot easier than the PC version. Survival is harder for more reasons than it should be, and touch controls are almost worthless in combat situations.<br /><br />Bottom line: while the game has a MC feel, it doesn't even come close to the current version. If you haven't played minecraft before this will introduce the basics. If you just want to have a quick MC fix while out and about, this will help a bit. But if you are already a MC veteran or played it on PC and want near PC resources you'll most likely stop playing once you hit the invisible wall.<br /><br />Review base off of play on my RAZR MAXX.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|ok this game is excellent. I have it on my phone and on my kindle!!!! I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! its just grrrreeeeaaaattttt!!!!!
B008XG1X18|4.0|great way to acess pinterest. my app does crash a lot. really annoyed with that. other that that no complaints here
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really enjoy this game!  It's addictive! Prize items could drop a little more often, though! Also the special coins should be worth more than they are.  Great game!
B0012NVGHU|5.0|I had seen this movie before and loved it then. So when I saw it was for sale at Amazon I had to have it.  I also followed up with a purchase a few months later of, \\"The Swell Season\\" at The Artist's Den with Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova. Just saw that and loved it too.
B0099G3I96|3.0|Pretty good, but I like their earlier music better.good good good good good good good good good good good good
0399157565|4.0|HELLO...this is now one of my 3 favorite KAY SCARPETTA books...and i defy you not to finish this one, or figure it out!! totally absorbing...and WHAT, just what is cornwell building to? wait and see in future books, meanwhile checkout MY interview with the master on my davidsbooktalk site...just add the [...] and dot.com...thank you
B004T4KQJS|5.0|An excellent book.  Krauss makes difficult and cutting edge topics understandable to anyone with an interest in physics and cosmology.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|bbbbbaaaaarf barfed yacked tossed cookies sharted.... ohh my virgin ears.  not a good movie and that is about it.  wont recommend or watch again
B007GCY8FS|2.0|First 300 pages were less than I had expected from this author,especially after eagerly awaiting his next book,and this was even after he allowed Tom Cruse to play the part of Jack  Reacher in the upcoming movie.However, the final 100 pages were merely creative garbage.I have to believe that Lee Childs is now just going through the motions for a paycheck and has compromised his integrity.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|I remember seeing the action-packed trailer on TV... which turns out to be all the action in the entire movie.<br /><br />The 100+ minute  film contains about 15 minutes of unexciting actual story, most of the rest being closeups of Jack (Clooney) expressionlessly staring out a window/driving a car/walking in the village. He has maybe four combined minutes of blankly-delivered dialogue, a mere fraction of the time dedicated to Clara's perpetually exposed... and far more lively... breasts.<br /><br />To reinforce the film's bland monotony, most of it transpires in drab, nearly monochromatic settings and flat directionless light. I don't even remember there being any musical score (after watching it last night, and I'm not about to suffer through it again to doublecheck) except for some menacing chords near the end.<br /><br />\\"Old West showdown\\"??? Gimme a break. He turns around and shoots the guy. And the cheesy symbolism just before ending credits roll is downright embarrassing. It's all so predictable; the only unexpected scene was the first many-minutes-long scrutiny of the nude Clara...kind of awkward when you're watching it with your wife.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|I enjoy the military. I respect the SEALS, immensely. And I've read many SEAL books because of that. Yes, the title is likely true. You will get to read about many people getting sniped and dying. But Chris Kyle just seems like a moron with simple views. fail.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|I would recommend if your into  battles and adorable monsters, Meant to  be played by females and males and is very exciting training your monster.<br /><br />Thank You,
B0092SQ5EG|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie. My girls really enjoyed it as well. It shows a part of Katty that normally you would not have seen.
B008BD9SI8|2.0|After Heroes, that sublime masterpice ( who corrected, imho, the wrongs of Best Served Cold ).<br /><br />Joe Abercrombie  is an accomplished writer, as a matter of fact ( his first trilogy is an anthology masterpiece ) knowing how to spin a tale and he weaves a perfect prose.<br /><br />I was tottally mistaken, when buying this book, thinking Abercrombie had gone \\"western \\"on us; he did, but in his world, and that i find an awesome twist and a worthy continuation of work done in the Union world.<br /><br />But the story lacks pace, lacks rythm, in my opinion; things start way too slow,  to then  get better.<br /><br />read it, enjoy it, being, after all, a book by the author that gave his top notch starter trilogy and Heroes.<br /><br />But it is neither one, nor the other.<br /><br />EDIT: After a certain amount of time digesting ( a couple of weeks ) this book's reading, I feel that the 3 star rating I gave it was due, solely, out of respect for Abrecrombie's work. This book does not deserve said 3 stars, as a matter of fact.<br /><br />I take one star out
B0094M2HM4|4.0|All things considered, the story was well told and the acting was pretty good. If you love music with any kind of soul, you'll appreciate this movie.
B008EQIK90|3.0|It was entertaining and funny. I would recommend it if you don't have high expectations, which hopefully you wouldn't have for this type of movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Make sure you read Bared to You: A Crossfire Novel Book 1 first...this is a great story.  Two very complex main characters...but all the great lust  and passion that you had with the Fifty Shades Trilogy...  I already have Book 3 preordered.<br />Reflected in You: A Crossfire Novel...A must read.  Enjoy!
0307951529|4.0|The $100 Startup is more difficult to explain than I expected. The book really has two missions. First, to help a budding entrepreneur realize that creating a startup business doesn't have to be complicated or expensive. Second, he provides the absolute minimum required step-by-step instructions on how to launch a startup business. As I read the book, I truly believed that starting a business was something that I could pull off. In many ways, this book is \\"fear repellent.\\" The concepts that I got out of the book: You don't need to be 100% certain of what you are doing - just start - you'll figure it out, give stuff away, build a tribe and don't over think the process. More hands-on than I expected and free resources such as checklists, step-by-step plans, etc. are available on the website. My only complaint is that he tends to focus on (short-term) product related launches instead of sustainable service businesses. Still, it's a valuable book that will help you get your butt in gear.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|You can't get any better than a Masterpiece<br />Theater production and this one tops just about<br />any ever produced. Mostly unknown actors (in the US<br />anyway), except for Dame Maggie Smith,  give us<br />a wonderful view of Edwardian England's class<br />society. Downton Abbey has it all. Romance<br />heartbreak, scandal, rumours, blackmail and<br />betrayal are all in play between the intertwined<br />lives of the upstairs Crawleys and their<br />downstairs servants. Simply superb.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|I stumbled upon Homeland when I was searching for something like \\"24,\\" which my husband and I enjoyed.  I like Homeland even better because it seems more..possible.  The twists and turns are surprising, and the characters more fully-fleshed-out than just the heavy breathing when there's a crisis. LOL  Unfortunately, we have watched all of Season 1 and Season 2 is not available because it is currently being run on Showtime.  That is a bit frustrating, but we will not be adding any more expenses to our cable bill...
B007THA4FI|4.0|Does Ms Rowling lilke people? The characters were well developed but thoroughly icky. The kids were worse than the parents and the parents were pretty nasty.<br />Unlike Elizabeth George, who wrote a similar book, Ms Rowling has very little compassion for her characters.<br />By the end of the book I felt bludgeoned by the plot. I will read the next novel just to Se if she is still mad at humans.
B008LSVLVA|5.0|Incredible piece of work. I highly recommend this product. Steven Wilson is an amazing prog rock force. Check out any Porcupine Tree for validation.
B008TMOIEK|5.0|I love listening to this soundtrack.  It makes me wonder just what was being played at what scene...  It actually prompted me to reread the series!
B007C6HHOM|4.0|Short film  but had great content.  Particularity like the FX zoombie horse scene. Cant wait for season three to begin.
B008TMA1LY|2.0|This app uses a trickery ploy to generate cash when your Kid unknowingly downloaded stuffs in order to play some other levels of the game.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game. it is a little annoying at first because the coins and stuff fall off thr side, but once you start getting some of the prize combos to level up, it gets better.
B007C94XG4|5.0|My kids and I watch it on my kindle fire, laptop and on the tv when we hook the laptop up to the tv. We loves this movie. Never gets old and is so worth the money and I am super picky on movies. Second movie sucked compared to the first movie and this one. Totally recommend.
030758836X|1.0|I liked this book when I first started reading it.  The characters are sweet loving people with a wonderful life ahead of them and then the wife goes missing.  But it didn't take long for me to HATE this story.  I hate all of its characters but the main two Nick and Amy most of all.  The fact that the author strings you along having you think one thing and then flips everything around is awful.  I kept reading the book thinking that there has to be something to all this but there isn't.  I was hoping that someone would finally kill both Amy and Nick and then I could be done with this stupid book. I skipped a lot of the chapters because most of it was boring nonsense and I actually threw it in the garbage when I reached the end.  Oh I'm sorry there is no end except for being left with the feeling that someone should call child protective services before one of these crazies killed their new born son. Do not waste your time - it will just make you mad.
B001NLKS16|2.0|The whole thing seemed to have a lot of filler with only a little extra insight into the series. The stuff about Sam and Dean growing up and John's own adventures wewre good but didn't make up nearly enough of the book.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|This book is definitely worth reading. It has a fascinating plot, set as it is during the period before and during the Second World War. A slight shortcoming is that the interpersonal relationships throughout the story tend to be naive and shallow. A great story though
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great read! Once you get started you cant put this book down. It grabs you from the first chapter. Can't wait for #3 to come out in December!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I found this work to be less than Lee Childs usual high quality story telling, it seemed full of filler and dragged out.
B0083P1QUM|1.0|This book felt like it was ghost-written by a fourth grader. Horrible sentence structure. So badly written that it defies analysis.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved the book! I waited and waited for it to come out & now I can't wait for the last one!
B007THA4FI|3.0|I guess because of all the hype I was expecting a great book.  I found it average, a little slow in spots, but about half way thru it drew me in.  If another author had written this book I would enjoyed more, perhaps because I won't have had such hight expections.
0307592731|1.0|Ms Strayed is a marginally good writer (in a popular sort of way) and those skills are evident here. Unfortunately what she has to write about in this book is herself, which is an utter waste of those skills. She is self-absorbed, superficial, and unprepared in an internet enabled world where that really is not an excuse anymore. While I sympathize with all the things that led her to begin this journey, and I can relate to much of it personally, it isn't enough to engage with a character that is so full of herself. Where people all the time must confront these and similar issues, she just runs away from them and becomes lost, largely blaming others for her inability to deal with it all. I could not get over the sense that even her journey back from the depths of a largely self inflicted hole in life was just a little too much (okay, a lot) about herself.<br />Maybe she has gone on to find a measure of happiness and worth in life, and writing this book may have been a cathartic passage of some sort, but what passed here for honestly, for me  was just the expression of an inflated sense of personal importance.  I enjoyed parts of the book. But by the end, I was wondering if this person was really worth our reading time.  Resoundingly, I concluded that she was not. A waste of a couple of days in front of my fireplace reading.<br /><br />Update (Nov 2016): For maybe similar reasons as to why I bothered to even finish this book, I have watched Gilmore Girls on Netflix, another depiction of self obsessed women who cannot lift their gaze beyond their own needs and wants, and who are incapable to see that other people inhabit the Earth with them. Well, I just saw that Lorelei Gilmore is going to do the &#34;Wild&#34; thing. That is about perfect. Please, if you have any influence, do not subject yet another generation of growing women to this nonsense. Let them grow up being whole, interesting, emotionally mature and caring people. Wild and GG are cut from the same obnoxious cloth. Stop this madness!this madness!
B0091REZMW|5.0|Fun game with a fantastic price. I love games like this - can't seem to get enough of them!!  Must play
0525953728|5.0|This book was an easy read and kept me turning the pages until I was finished.  Thought provoking and insightful.
1439152802|5.0|I'm currently half way thru this book and I'm totally enthralled.  I have loved loved her other books, and this one is not disappointing.  Highly recommend.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|From the opening scene during the credits to the final moments, this delightful film brought back fond memories of times long ago when we lived in India for half a year and in fact walked the very streets in this film.  The dialog captures Indian spontaneity and enthusiasm.  Little misunderstandings arise and are resolved.  Clever humor.  If you can't go there yourself, this film will tell you what it is like!
B008TMA1LY|4.0|The game is really fun and addicting, but you can't accrue enough heart points to keep up with it without using real money and it does get expensive.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|So easy to get caught up in this game, especially as you go through the levels. Two things would have made it better, more levels and the ability to get hints...
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is a fun and easy read. I enjoyed the first half of the book much more than the second half. The ending in particular lack a closing punch...
B008MU8ZOI|5.0|If that review title makes no sense, then you'll need to watch the movie to get the answer.  It will slowly creep up on you, literally.  I love good intelligent horror (and some really stupid horror, but not so much).  This movie is smart, funny, well-paced, and terrifying.  The relationship between the brother and sister is also very believable (and they are also both nice to look at).  Be aware that the \\"F\\" word is used many times.  The movie itself looks a lot better on blu-ray than the standard def version I've watched (again and again) over the years.  It is pretty gory, if you consider decapitation or running over a body multiple times to be gory.  There are a lot of dead bodies, if that bothers you.  Watch for the face off between the \\"Strip-O-Gram\\" cop and the Creeper; truly over-the-top.  This is one of my favorite horror films, somewhere in the top ten.  I think you'll like it to.
B003DTMUOE|5.0|De lo mejor, es la clase de libro que no dejas de leer desde que lo empiezas, es una aventura por la vida que te deja muchas cosas en que pensar
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat right up to the end. One of his better efforts. I've read all his books and this is one of his top ones.
0783225857|5.0|What a unique treasure this movie is, I recommend purchasing this DVD for your personal collection and encourage you to play it for everyone in your family especially your children. This is so much more than a movie; it is a learning tool for young and old alike. Trust me on this; you will have no regrets and only praise for this masterpiece.
B008H5J510|5.0|I'm a Katycat so of course I'm in love with this movie. But even if youre not a fan of Katy Perry, this movie will convert you into one.It's funny, cute, and emotional.
B009QW6ZT8|1.0|I've purchased/rented many [HD] movies/shows on Amazon, and this CLEARLY is not being streamed in High Def. I streamed it using three different computers and three different high-definition TV's and it is displaying in Standard Def. To make sure it wasn't possibly something going wrong with Amazon's streaming service, I streamed HD episodes of Hell on Wheels, which looked crisp, clear, and stunning.<br /><br />Do NOT get cheated; this is NOT HD.<br /><br />And, if anyone wants to know, I have a download speed that ranges from 18-25 MB per second. And yes, I let it buffer.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|It took me only 2 days to finish reading this book. The 2nd part really grabbed me. It was such an emotional roller coaster, my heart was beating so fast when I finally put my kindle down.
0061808121|5.0|This audio version of To Kill a Mockingbird featuring Sissy Spacek reading this classic is a must have. Especially if you drive often, or have a long commute to and from work. Sissy's southern roots give life to this story of a young six-year-old girl living in 1932 small town in Alabama. This was simply how it was back in those days. Even if you have read the book, I recommend getting this audio version; it's a whole deferent view of this classic masterpiece
0061900656|5.0|it's the big brother's favorite new book!  i was afraid he'd still be too young for it (19 mos.), but i guess he isn't because his parents report that it's all he wants read to him now.  great buy!
B000JCSPG0|1.0|I'm a great fan of Sc-Fi and the storyline seemed interesting, so this film must be worth watching I thought - how wrong I was. Everything about this film is poor; the directing is poor, the scriptwriting is poor, the acting is bad, the music is awful. There are so many faults in this movie I couldn't possibly list them all, but here are a few of the worst things about the film. The actions and situations of the people are so unrealistic it is laughable (I thought Spielberg was the master of this but this director takes it to an all-time low). We have the most important discovery in the history of mankind and it's left in the hands of a bunch of people who you wouldn't even trust to cook your dinner for you. They send in a bunch of Marines who are like a group of 10 year-old boys on their first scouting expedition, led by Kurt Russell who walks around like a John Wayne on Mogadon. The James Spader character is an imbecile who can't even talk without getting flustered and somehow he manages to decipher the hieroglyphics that the experts have been working on for years as soon as he walks into the room. It's rife with cliches and stereotypes, the first ten shots of Kurt Russell has him lighting up and taking a puff of a cigarette (no it doesn't make you look tough !) and the female elderly lady speaks in her fake foreign accent, stares when she speaks and smirks to herself like she knows everything about everything - it's absolutely cringeworthy. The plagiarisms are also too many to name, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, the Time Machine, they're all here. The music is loud, constant, overused and so irritating its almost unbearable to watch. The shameful thing is, that underneath it all lies the potential of a really good film. The egyptian connections and the idea of a porthole to another place in the universe was a concept of great promise. Sadly the makers of this film obliterated any hope of anything worthwhile coming out of it. The director and producer are largely to blame, the acting is bad but even Al Pacino would not have saved this film.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Easy to visualize. i enjoyed the book and the suspense. Easy to follow. Cannot think of any thing else to write.
B009EAO38C|5.0|The piano guys Cd is a nice change from the norm. Relaxing yet fun renditions of popular songs make this Cd a favorite.. highly recommended ....
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|addicting game. fun! this is a good game to get your mind moving quickly. besides.it gives you something to do. hard to get three stars
B000I186FW|5.0|Critically burned by a governmental fu@k up during a forced medical internment, a mysterious masked man spurs social justice in this futuristic thriller.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This was a very good purchase for me as I take my college corse through distance education and everything is done on the computer. This product allows me to write discussion posts and papers when I am away from home, and I love it. Some things were a little confusing at first, but once I figured it out it was all good!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Great story. Very unique and engaging. I look forward to more work from this author. Cannot put this book down!
B00280LYHS|5.0|This instance captures and typifies Riordans ability to merge ancient legend into the ever changing landscape of pop-culture laden YA fiction. As a parent I enjoy and anticipate each title as much or more so than my teens and tweens. This title did not disappoint: a compelling and enjoyable read.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is a really great product because it speeds up my typing on my HTC Android Incredible Phone by predicting the word I want to type quite often.If I could I would give this only 4 1/2 stars because using some of the punctuation is not so intuitive or easy, the ? for example.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|The characters are beyond stupid, and the plot lacks even the most simple of fundamental reasoning.  I wasn't expecting anything \\"intellectual,\\" but this was just dumb.  It doesn't even win on action/adventure points.  Watch something else.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I think this game is fun. wouldn't play it if it cost money but its fun for free. I wish you could unlock more things for free
B008673ZAQ|4.0|If you enjoyed Bared to You- this is a must read. More than explosive sex- mystery and sadness.  Leaves you panting for the third installment!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It works just like my desk top. I am now able very many different document on my kindle.  It's nice to have
B001I82RVS|3.0|This is a foreign film that is fun, action packed, corny but yet it keeps you wondering and at the edge of your seat through out the whole movie.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is good. I have never experienced any glitches when I played it. very fun game.get this game now!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I expected the second book to be better than the first. The story line had great potential to develop the relationship, but instead, I felt disconnected from the romance and more subjected to the control issues. I hope the 3rd books goes back to the romance.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is an awesome sequel in a great series. Like this series more than fifty shades of grey!! Must read!!
B009GEEMLY|5.0|This movie was so action packed, I couldn't take my eyes away from the screen. The quality of the movie was excellent, I felt like I could reach out & touch the characters. The Hulk kicked ass. My favorite was when he picked Lokey up & flung him around like a rag doll! It was awesome!
B008SOS63S|5.0|Beacon Theatre is classic Bonamassa.  A little of all his great music.  \\"Midnight Blues\\" is to die for - I would have bought this CD even if that was the only song on it.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Just like their first album, Mumford and Sons makes another great one. You won't be disappointed after listening to it.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Although a little tedious at the start, in switching from character to character and slow development, overall an entertaining read.<br /><br />At the outset I was tempted to put it down because I couldn't remember who was who and who did what and with which and to whom, but eventually I got to know them and the switching became less distracting.<br /><br />I really saw it as a representation of a slice of life in an average community.  I was a volunteer fireman in just such a small community, surrounded and encroached on, on two sides, by a city and the town we were part of, all of our (the firemen) lives intertwined, the heroes, the cowards, the cheaters, and devious schemers, and especially the unique few whose heroic acts were a total surprise to all including themselves.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|I'm usually pretty hard on my reviews. (I try to be fair) But I have to say that I just really enjoy reading B. Cornwell.  He just has a way of telling the story that makes you forget you are even reading.  If this is the genre that you like to read this it doesn't get better.
B008GVD6D8|4.0|i really enjoyed the first book with the characters so i was eagerly waiting on the follow up and it didnt disappoint. i was ready to kill those meddling in the fundamental relationship and totally got her paranoia. if you enjoyed the first book you should enjoy this one:)
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book was written well, but at times it was hard to figure out who was talking when.  The ending was rather dissappointing and confgusing.  I might read something else from this author just to see if his writing is any better in a different book.  I give it 2.5 stars.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I really loved this book as much as the rest of the series. The story really caught me and sent me on a roller coaster. Wonderful books for older kids and young adults.
B009IA9OLE|1.0|I like games like this but this isn't worth the money! no goals of upgrades to work for after the apartment. lousy game!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I totally enjoyed this book and really didn't know what I was getting into when I started it. I hope there are more books forthcoming!  It was just an interesting ride and the characters compelling...well done.

B005RUUUAI|5.0|Walking Dead is a great series! Keeps you on the edge of your seat always!! Never saw it coming!! Highly recommended!
B008CFN95I|4.0|This is a book that delivers full frontal nerdity from beginning to end! But despite the very now technology references, it celebrates the printed word.  Wonderful, flawed, interesting, nerdy characters, a code, google and lots and lots and lots of books. I loved it.
B009KHBDUU|3.0|Barely resembled the original series. Acting was OK, but just too campy for me. Previews make it look better than is actually is.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Fun game that is a little addicting, the reverse icon never seems to work though. Wish there was a guide line type thing

B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am loving my Kindle Fire Hd and accessories we got for it!<br />It's great for my email and reading books.  I didn't think I would like it as much as my husband loves his year old Kindle Fire, but I do.  I decorated my black cover with some pretty stickers of crystals!
B004JZBGWI|3.0|The coolest feature is the different color pads.. Makes things easy to organize. Another good thing is the auto save. If a phone call comes in or some interruption Booom! It auto saves.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I'm not sure how I feel about this book. For a while I was thinking why in the world  are they still doing together!! I found myself getting annoyed by all the games. Once I realized why he was doing what he was, I felt better about the book. I of course have to finish the series because I need to know what happens with Eva and Gideon!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Read it in 24 hours. I can not wait too read the next 2 books soon.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this series!  I agree with some of the reviews about the wiplash but I loved it.  I can't wait for the final installment!
B0098VYCCE|1.0|The movie has nothing except for the rare special effects. Except for Chris Hemsworth, Charlize and the scenes with the Dwarves, the movies is not worth the time and money. The real villains in this movie are the sketchy storyline and Kristen Stewart. I should really give a nobel prize for the one who discovered her, and for the one who thinks that she can act. Kristen just does not know when to tune in and tune out of the character. She is the weakest link.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I had problem finishing this book, couldn't get pass a page, but the customer service helped me with it. Love this new book. I think it is not just a book for children, but for all of us who love a good read.

B003O86FMW|4.0|typical teenage girl fair,twilight like,I love this boy no i love this boy ,juvenile ,simple story line but very readable
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Excellent book, this book remind me so much of Fifty Shades of Grey.I love reading the first two books in this series also, but I feel like i am cheating on Christian by liking this book.  I still like Fifty Shades better, but I am not going to lie Giedon can ride me for 10 hours to the Outer Banks and pamper me also.  I still say people can say what they want to about reading these types of books, they are really good and I love them.  If they were not good all of us would now be reading them and buying them. To the women with the small minds saying they are not good, why did you read it in the first place and then say they are not for them, LIAR. Yes it put spice in your life also.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Great movie.  You have to go into this with the sense that you are about to learn of the events leading up to the original Alien movie.  If you have a sense of discovery, interest, and excitement.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I had a really hard time getting into this book.  For the first 20% (I read it on my Kindle) I kept asking myself why this book was such a huge bestseller because I didn't find the plot all that compelling and I found the main characters unlikable.  Then the author, Gillian Flynn, started dropping little tidbits to clue the reader in that there was more to the story and the characters than was readily apparent.  There weren't a ton of these, but enough to keep me reading.  And then I reached Part Two of the book and everything changed.  For the second half of the book I was riveted.  And I was blown away by the ending, which I would never have guessed in a million years.  So if you pick the book up and you're not particularly enjoying the first half, stick with it.  It gets better.  Much, much better.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|totally addicted. I can't stop playing! I would recommend this game to every one! my grandkids come to visit and fight over who gets to beat grandma's score!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I am a huge fan on the Percy Jackson series, and I love that the story continues in The Heroes of Olympus. This was truly worth the wait after the Son of Neptune. It is an easy read, and it has all the surprise and humor the rest of the books have had. Definitely worth your money!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Fabulous read.  Well researched, terrific plot and dialogue and characters you care about.  Story telling doesn't get much better than this!
B008XG1X18|5.0|love being able to access pinterest from my fire kindle! now I can tag items I find interesting from anywhere! app works great, had it installed for a couple weeks and no problems so far!
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I can still remember the first time I saw Titanic. It is one of those movies that moves you and takes you to another time and place. Some say that men don't or shouldn't cry. I am not ashamed to say that I cried like a baby. It simply touched me in that way. It's a film that will always stay with me. Loved every minute of it.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Mumford & Sons New Album is worth it. I enjoyed the songs :<br />1.) Lovers Eyes<br />2.) I will Wait<br />3.) Below my Feet<br />4.) Holland Road<br />5.) The Boxer<br /><br />Love the whole album.... Great buy
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Great app - works great!  Takes away all of those extra steps of having to have the computer up and running in order to print from my iPhone.
B0078XFYDA|5.0|Enjoyed this book . I feel it gives an explanation to a lot of things. Instead of ideas I see facts. Too bad we have to live in a fantasy. Not a healthy way to live. Reality  is beautiful too. And maybe more beautiful than fantasy.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|The game is one of the best &quot;bejeweled&quot;-like games.  I really liked how they involved an interesting story in it.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|All of these books are awesome!! If you are thinking of buying this you have already read the other four so you know!!!
B008673ZAQ|2.0|There is a lot left to e desired. If you are looking for answers better wait for book three!  Here's hoping she pulls it together by then
B008E6I1K8|4.0|I like the fact that the book starts with the very basics and goes into advanced topics. So it is a complete reference on the language.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I have read every novel and wait impatiently for each new release.  This novel was my first dissapointing read from this author because when the plot began to unfold it was too confusing regarding the double agents and multiple government agencies.  It was the first time I didn't finish a Reacher novel and concerned about future reads.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|A great follow-up to book one. Can't wait for book three to see how Day wraps this us for us.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Great read. Ms. Harkness  weaves a wonderful story.  Together with obvious historical research and a splendid imagination Ms. Harkness has created a work that is hard to set down. It is also refreshing to have a well written book from one who has a mastery of writing skills.  I'm better than halfway through book 2 in the trilogy and can't wait for #3
B00136JS12|5.0|This is the first, and arguably best album released by Boston.  I love Boston, but this is really the only complete album of theirs that I would highly recommend buying.  If you love classic rock, this is a must have album for your collection.  This was the first album I ever owned, and as a kid, I practically wore out the cassette tape I had of this album.  Back before mp3 when you had to carry every album on a cassette... this was frequently the only tape I would carry with me whenever I took a long car ride or our family went on vacation and I wanted to listen to music.  The songs have an easy going yet rocking rhythm that is very hard to describe.  The closest comparison I can think of is maybe Queen or Pink Floyd.  I love having the songs now to play on my mp3 player as it will remind me of those happy times riding in the back seat with headphones plugged into an old Walkman.
B00943SQCI|4.0|This was an entertaining movie.  Nothing too extraordinary, but it was a good way to spend a rainy afternoon.  Johnny Depp is always good in these roles, but it gets a little tiresome after a while.  The movie feels like it's dragging on a bit, but there's enough little funny or interesting parts to keep you into it until the end.  I would recommend seeing it, but wouldn't call it a must-see.
B007FEGH7Y|5.0|These guys opened for metric and after the first song I was googling to find them. The show was awesome. This album is great I look forward to herring more from this band
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is very addictive. I started playing this game as a trial for earning credits for annother game but got hooked.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a wonderful app. You can even calibrate your battery. Other users have posted concerns about overheating but I have not had any problems like that. It is plugged and charging now and still cool to the touch. The reading is at 77.0 degrees. I love this app and recommend it to everyone using a Kindle Fire.
B008XG1X18|5.0|There are so many things I like about Pinterest.  I can't even begin to name them.  It is a lot of fun!!!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|so cool I love this game and its downloading right now on my kindle fire and I have it on my ipod
B008JDAC7G|5.0|I downloaded this amazingness on to the Kindle Fire and now I've stopped reading my e-books. MAMC is my crack  and the hot mess of stimulating visuals, power ups  & diamonds make the 2 hours of down time fly by.<br />My favorite monster is the epic blue unicorn horse thing (I've havent bothered to learn their names ok, the primary colors are enough to go by) and he is my savior.<br />The music is jamming and when the fat lady sings... Man I feel gutted.<br />Probably the best fast paced (well when you level up to 20) combo game I've played in a while. G'bless you Adult Swim. I kinda really want a part 2 with new monsters :3
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I love this app. There are so many wonderful sounds to relax or fall asleep to. I frequent the thunderstorm sounds on my nightly slumber. Great sound quality and I can set the amount of time I want it to play; which is good since 95% of the time I fall asleep listening to the sounds of nature.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I wanted to download some cartoons that my grandson could watch on my Kindle Fire on a long road trip. Since the videos are downloaded, there is no need for Wi-Fi in order to watch. (you must be connected to Wi-Fi while downloading). This works, and I have no reservations recommending this to everyone.
B009GED1IY|5.0|It was advertised as a Tom Cruise movie, but he is only in 5 minutes of the movie. I think that it was better for it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I also play this game on facebook as well as on my ipad. thanks for finally adding it for the kindel apps.
B00004Y2FT|4.0|Cocteau Twins was a uniquely ahead of its time phenomenon in alternative music, becoming a highly influential cult band to the Paisley Underground, C-86 and Shoegaze movements that would dominate Great Britain's scene on the years to come. However, unlike most influential cult acts, their strong points lie not on their albums but on their songs, for which a compilation will provide a full overview of the band's talents without cutting corners.<br /><br />On Stars & Topsoil, most of the key cuts from their 4AD studio albums and EPs are present, and the overall output of songs like \\"Aikea-Guinea\\", \\"Sugar Hiccup\\" and their minor hit \\"Heaven Or Las Vegas\\" provide the ultimate snapshot of the Twins unique brand of ethereal guitar pop. Stars & Topsoil does manage to connect the metamorphosis the Twins attained with each record in a chronological fashion, but the load of different visions and production techniques present throughout their full career does tend to break the uniformity of the collection, signalling listeners that the actual studio albums may fit better with their desired mood.
B008QE9XD2|1.0|This 2012 film is a very loose adaptation of various storylines from the cult gothic suspense soap opera DARK SHADOWS (1966-71).  In this, Tim Burton's version, the vampire Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) returns to the ancestral mansion after 200 years locked in a coffin, determined to restore the sagging family fortunes.  There are brief moments of real horror, as well as much crude fish-out-of-water humor as Barnabas tries to get used to life in 1972.  As is usual with Burton, the film is visually quite striking.<br /><br />At one point during the film, Barnabas asks Willie (Jackie Earl Haley), his mentally-enslaved mortal lackey, to dispose of the corpse of one of his victims.  On learning of this tragedy, Willie shrugs it off with: \\"I never liked the bitch anyway.\\"  As one who had watched the original show, I immediately recalled that this attitude was nothing like that of the original Willie (John Karlen), who was constantly fighting against his master's mind-control, who always tried, in one way or another, to save his master's victims and prevent his killings, and who always grieved deeply when he failed.<br /><br />But my point is not to complain that this film is unfaithful to the old series (though it certainly is).  My point is to explain why it fails on its own terms.  The problem with Willie's attitude here is that it is not just Willie's attitude --it is everybody's.  NOBODY cares that Barnabas is an undead serial murderer.  Not Collins matriarch Elizabeth Stoddard (Michelle Pfeifer); not her teen daughter Carolyn (Chloe Moretz); not her 10-year old nephew David (Gulliver McGrath); not live-in psychiatrist Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter); not David's governess Victoria Winters (Bella Heathcote).  And it is not as though they don't find out.  The only character who tries to make an issue out of his murders is the evil witch Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green) and she is motivated not by morality, but petty revenge.<br /><br />Even Josette DuPres, who in the original threw herself off a cliff to escape Barnabas and avoid becoming like him, has no such motive here.  Here, she dives off the cliff for entirely different reasons.  Here, Josette's ghost entirely approves of Barnabas, and would like nothing less than to be united with him forever as an immortal undead serial murderer.<br /><br />Are the scriptwriter and director trying to make some kind of ironic point with all this moral obtuseness?  Not as far as I can tell.  They seem merely to project their own attitudes.  Here, Barnabas swears to Elizabeth that he would never harm family.  Unlike the original Barnabas (who for all his fine talk would not have hesitated to murder even little David) he apparently speaks the truth.  The script constantly returns to this theme of family loyalty, a virtue that apparently excuses and justifies all other crimes.  Apparently, we are expected to cheer for and root for Barnabas, even after watching him butcher a half-dozen construction workers and an entire van-full of nice young hippies.  We are then expected to nod with approval as he preaches family values and good parenting to Roger Collins (Jonny Lee Miller).  This is mafia morality.<br /><br />This is not vampire horror, nor even (primarily) vampire comedy.  It is vampire fantasy.  Burton assumes his audience WANT to become vampires, like Bela Swann in the TWILIGHT series.  But this vampire is no Edward Cullen: a sparkly do-gooder who never takes human blood.  He looks like a corpse (moreso even than the original Barnabas, played with suitable menace by craggy-faced Jonathan Frid) and murders without compunction.  That is why, whether you label it horror or comedy, it simply does not work.  We cannot be scared because there is no-one to root for (except the anonymous victims); we cannot laugh because it is just not funny.<br /><br />The main horror comes from our glimpse into the dark hearts and diseased souls of Tim Burton and Seth Grahame-Smith.  They seriously need their butts kicked.heir butts kicked.
B007KFZ7RE|5.0|This album should be at the top of the heap of retro sounding recordings of the last decade, topped only by Amy Winehouse. Nick Waterhouse is a vocal and musical original, finding obvious inspiration in 1950's Rock n Roll, and 60's Soul.<br /><br />The standout cuts include \\"Some Place\\", \\"Say I Wanna Know\\", \\"Is That Clear\\", and \\"I Can Only Give You Everything.\\" I would call this album a masterpiece but that would be too cliche.<br /><br />What will eventually add to the collectibility of this actual pressing is the fact that the packaging is designed to look like a vintage vinyl LP. Don't wait for this to be issued in a jewel case. Buy it now. Its a keeper and well worth the purchase price!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|and if I had read all 13,000+ reviews I may have saved my $10 and not read it either but I had to see what the big deal was about.<br /><br />It certainly wasn't about the writing.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey was a decent first book, not great but not bad. There are lots of things that end up being repetitious early like the biting of the lip and the blushing but a more experienced writer wouldn't do this as much.<br /><br />Do I believe Good Morning America and think this book is going to change my sex life forever? Not on your life. I've read both kinkier and more emotionally compelling love scenes by other authors. This book isn't enough to change me.<br /><br />However, Christian Grey does get brownie points for giving Anastasia a Mac.<br /><br />I wasn't interested in the love story in the slightest until after Chapter 5. The relationship was very slow to develop.<br /><br />I tried to compare it to Twilight and I couldn't do it on a fair level. Twilight was so much more intense and better written despite the PG rating. This book may have evolved from fan fiction, but I don't think it should be the benchmark to compare all books.<br /><br />The author has connections in the movie industry and I think she used them to get people talking about the book. I think as soon as authors heard fan fiction, they freaked out and thought that this book shouldn't even be published. This book got people talking and for whatever that is worth it brought BDSM out of the closet and has become more acceptable by mainstream society.<br /><br />I don't think my opinion has changed. The author is a smart woman with the skills to get people talking about her book. I don't think this is the greatest book I ever read but the marketing behind it that thrust it into a #1  national bestseller was phenomenal.<br /><br />I have to look at this book from an entertainment level and definitely not a realistic one. I can't relate to the heroine and wanting to be abused and the further you get into the pages the more twisted Christian's mind becomes.<br /><br />The rest of the series may get better but I am not sure I will be reading this author again. The storyline would have to be exceptional.<br /><br />Do I think you should read it? I think there are enough opinions on here, but I think you can only have an opinion of her writing style after having read it for yourself.et into the pages the more twisted Christian's mind becomes.<br /><br />The rest of the series may get better but I am not sure I will be reading this author again.

B003AYMZO2|5.0|... and it's still great. Most TV I wouldn't watch even once. This story is well-written, beautifully acted, deftly directed. It's a work of art. Up there with Deadwood, The Sopranos, and very, very few others.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This movie was thoroughly enjoyable and as one who is in this age bracket, totally believable!  I would recommend this to anyone of any age.  There is truly something for all.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|This is a very fun navy flight simulator I like that you can land on both an airbase and an aircraft carrier. I also like the choice of planes.

B0053O89KG|5.0|Great Show! Great Characters! Great Cast!<br /><br />A mystery with humour & pathos, plus a love storyline too boot. Great interplay between the characters. Plenty of surprises. You never go to sleep.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have had this backpack for a few months now. I searched and searched for a good backpack camera bag. I looked at many different shops, stores, and online. The quality is great. The organization is fantastic. Plenty of storage for smaller accessories. It is very comfortable to carry over the shoulder. I am more than happy with the purchase of this backpack. When needed, I will buy another one.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is this first hidden object game I can say I enjoed from start to finish. The images and puzzles were complex enough to hold my attention but not just stuck into the storyline like they didn't belong. Searching for the kidnapped Kate leads you through a large map of interactive scenes and just when I thought I was finished, another group of events lead me off solving another portion of the case! Bravo! Ready for the next one!
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I like alot of the actors in the movie so i will admit my review is biased.  Action was decent.  Some of the scenes were not developed enough and could have been left out.  All in all its still a must see for marvel comic fans!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I read this book in a few days. I liked it better than the first, for the most part. At times, I was frustrated with the \\"two steps forward, one step back\\"thing dynamic. In the end, it all worked out though. Can't wait for the next one.
B007THA4FI|4.0|The characters had such depth. They sucked me into the story and held my interest in such a way that I was surprised how much I cared about their lives.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Awesome graphics!  Such a cool game to play.  Only thing that stinks is how long it takes to restore energy and how much energy it costs to get into each room.  other than that its a great game!
B00785P2QC|5.0|i have had this game fo the last tow mouths and i can not get over it at all plus it is free wich is a good thing
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Ordinarily a Follett Fan, Winter of the World left me quite lukewarm! It lacked the drama while dripping with predictability.<br />During an extraordinarily period of man's inhumanity to man, his focus remained on the pettiness of the inevitable British social dynamic and the ongoing \\"struggle\\" between Lord and Commoner, ending rather tritely.<br /><br />Were it not for his writing skills,........?
B007IXWL2C|2.0|After three books of non-stop sex, the reader becomes bored:enough is enough!  But otherwise the books are well-written and I look forward to new work by the author.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|I really enjoy their music The service at Amazon I will defenily use again The new cd was a long time coming for a very fan love every track
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I got this app because I was having trouble falling asleep and it really works! I would defiantly recommend this to any one! :)
B0096HIEE2|3.0|Good movie. However am I disappointed by the lack of bonus features and deleted dance scenes. It's nice getting movies early with digital release but with no extras I feel like I'm getting the short end of the stick. And with this movie the short end of the stick is unacceptable and a shame.
B00847TKSE|5.0|I remember the press coverage at the time and the fact that everyone seemed to be following the story about the whales frozen in the ice up in Alaska.  It's amazing what can happen when everyone is trying to look good in the press!  Great movie, good performances by the whole cast.  Loved the native Alaskan man and his special bond with the animals his people hunted and revered.
B008S80P38|5.0|The majority of the tunes on ATGH will probably sound familiar if you've listened to Deadmau5' earlier works --- this latest album seems more a rehash of old ideas than the smashing originality evident in his prior albums. Most of the tracks are masterfully produced, but in some (The Veldt, Professional Griefers) they seem almost over-produced. For instance, the video version of The Veldt ran at approximately 3 minutes and seemed full and complete at that length, but the album version is closer to 9 minutes and it feels drawn out and overly long. I find myself wanting to skip to the next track about halfway through the song, whereas I can listen to the video version back to back and be hungry to hear it again. On Professional Griefers I loved its richness and depth as an instrumental, but loathe it with Way's overwhelming vocal track. I wish that the album had at least contained both the vocal and instrumental versions so I could skip the vocal and jam the instrumental. Sometimes more just for the sake of more equals less. It's still a fine album, just not as great as I'd anticipated. Meow. <3<br /><br />*** Edit: Had to bump this to 5 stars after a couple more play-throughs. My problem with The Veldt is my problem ... listening to it with fresh ears I realize that it has grown, and that I was only tied to the version I by now know by heart. There IS more here, and I'm hearing it. Greatness.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I loved the first book and this was not quite as goood as the first one but still had me reeling at the end. I love the characters so much in these novels and finally in this book we see Gideons truly wonderful self.
0547569653|4.0|During races I've always wondered what the lead runners are thinking and finally there is a runner who was able to tell me. I think Jurek was able to tell his story, warts and all, without coming off as an ego maniac. Through his honesty he is able to motivate not only to get people to learn to enjoy running, but also to enjoy preparing and eating healthy food. And for a back of the pack ultra runner, it was nice to know that the winner has the same struggles as everyone else out on the course.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book mixes fictional characters that add to the drama of WWI.  If you are a history buff you will love the recounting of the first World War and if not, You will learn a lot!!!  Can't wait for the next one!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Do not buy this book unless you have the time to read it because ONCE YOU START YOU WILL NOT WANT TO PUT IT DOWN. It is a fascinating, compelling read and drew you deep and dangerously into the story and the characters. The story starts off with one wife missing .... but pages later after mystery, intrigue and also sorts of twists and turns you begin to wonder \\"what is really going on\\" and of course, the rest is history, you need to finish that book as quickly as possible!!

By the age of 36, the spirit of Bob Marley had healed many people, and will continue to do so for centuries to come.  Is this not a prophet, is this not a call to higher ground for us all?  Go ahead and wish us all well that we live, inspire and love like Bob Marley.  If you feel His Presence, you will shed tears.

B005JE1JZC|5.0|This is my favorite series of the first three series I have read. I am really enjoying it a lot. Robin Hobb is an awesome author.
B0007MAJBQ|5.0|Fastest way to get recording jobs done, MiniDisc Recorders have many features.  I can track mark where one Song or Topic ends and another begins; I can do this faster than using a computer, and if I don't like where I put the track mark I can move it to where I want it.  I can also move any song or topic from one location to another in seconds.  If I have something I don't want I can just delete it. I can can display text like for album and also for songs or topics.  I can get remove noise between songs by tack marking at the end of one song and the beginning of the next and deleting it.  Now if I want dead silent space between songs I can use my Sony stereo MD Recorder to pause 3 seconds between songs while I record back on another MiniDisc with my walkman MD Recorder.  I can be doing other things, no baby sitting necessary.  I can record a Medley of Songs from a Record with no bands and make a MD that will start when I Music Seach exactly where that song begins.  You need to get that track mark right first as the Song Titles tie to the track mark, change the track and the Song Title is gone has to be done again.  Cassette Records take two records to most things and a lot more time getting things correct: almost impossible.  Same for CD recorder, I can't move the track marks on CD-Rs, have to throw disc away and try again.  CD-RW I was told that you have to remove everything after what needs corrected and start over from there.  Sony made a few mistakes, I have computer with a MiniDisc Drive, but if you put music on the computer to write title with a keyboard it see it was digital and it won't let you make an MD completed copy; however, you can make CD's.  To use the Computer for MiniDics, you have to record into the computer in slow real time with the analog jacks, and everything takes longer to do on the computer except for typing text.  Using CDs, I never could make a Medley of continues Songs with track marks in the right place and no sound drop out; I could with the MiniDisc.  I was told that CD-Rs have certaing spots for track marks, which is not exactly between songs; otherwise, can have some sound drop.  I got this information from Cool Edit, now Audition from Adobe. I use the this software to remove noise, and i could change the tempo without changing the pitch etc.<br /><br />Sony made a big mistake with the MiniDisc in the US, and I heard sale were not good enough.  I also notice that MiniDisc recorders were not well advertised.  People won't buy, if they don't know they exist.  This hurts me as I will need new recorders someday.  I also heard they went over big in Japan; you could even put you MiniDisc into a JukeBox and download songs. They need to come back advertised and allow us to use the faster digital features with out copy protect blocking.  Minidisc recorders also have optical inputs and outputs.  I don't know anything else to use with these features.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This was a good read, you could feel the passion coming from Travis and Abby a mile away.  The story was believable  and exciting . You can' t help but root for these two and cringe for them at the same time..

1439152802|5.0|When it comes to fiction, I'm not easy to please: I need characters that seem real, and I need to be surprised by a story I could not write myself. This is what I find in the books of Kate Morton. Her characters tend to haunt me (I still grieve for Eliza of \\"The Hidden Garden\\"). Ms. Morton's twists-of-plot keep me reading from beginning to end, finishing a book within two days. The way that the smallest detail can lead to a cascade of consequences seems much like \\"real life\\".<br /><br />I waited and waited for \\"The Secret Keeper\\" and it didn't let me down. This is due in part to my love of history and my need for any book I read not to be made of air and fluff. It is also due to the author's talent when it comes to character development: I have known people who resemble the characters in this book. As is usual with Ms. Morton's work, I thought I knew how the story would play out, but in the end I wept my way through the final bit. Good tears; cathartic tears-- not a bad thing... more of an amazing thing, that a work of fiction can do this to me... it probably happens because I have been pulled tightly into a story, every aspect of which rings true.
B006VGGAC4|4.0|Curiosity prompted my purchase. Not necessarily an Arnold fan but the book promised to be interesting. Obviously I knew that part of the book would  take the readers thru the bodybuilding phase of his life. I read it expecting to be mildly bored but there were plenty of parts that made me laugh out loud. I recommended to my husband that he should read it.  Yes Arnold has made some huge errors in his decisions but most of us have in one way or another. He took this book on knowing he would need to be honest and he was. I really did enjoy reading it and I wish him well.
B000NDI3SK|1.0|I got sucked into buying this weird set because of all the rave reviews. It cost a lot of money and I am angry.<br />  I watched part one of the first disc and hoped for better with part two. Part one spends a whole lot of time with endless repeats of some muscular man pole vaulting. This series of repeats begins with crotch shots in slow motion of a male runner at the start position of a track run. Oh shucks, what did I buy for over 60 dollars ? ! There is some nonsense about why this is all meaningful. Well I hoped it would improve but it did not. From there it went to some Laplanders castrating some raindeer, and somehow again, this was all supposedly meaningful.<br />  I hoped the series would improve with part two. Part two opened up with those same Laplanders. I am packing it up and sending it back. Seemingly endless repeats of the same footage. This is weird stuff in my opinion, very weird.<br />  Whatever charm this man has wears thin and fast. Like I said I am packing it up and sending it back. Worse than not worth watching. Is there any brain eraser available for those who wish to erase images presented in this series from their brains ? You are going to want it with this one.  ...Oscar
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|The Phantom of the Opera is one of my all time favorites.  The presentation of this story, \\"Love never dies\\" picks right up from the first story, the stage play is an absolutely amazing performance.<br /><br />The young woman that plays \\"Christine\\" is superb.  The stage settings and drama is absolutely mezmerizing.  I didn't feel as strong of a connection to the Phantom in this one, as I did in the movie with Gerard Butler, but the performance of the Phantom in this stage play is also very well done and superb.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Good sounds and graphics, gray game play.  I can have trouble with color schemes of assume games, but had no problems here.
1476712042|5.0|This book was so different than I thought it would be, but in a very, very, good way!<br /><br />The dynamic of the relationship was so intense and real. The ups and downs... the good, the bad... the happiness and extreme devastation. I loved every minute of it!<br /><br />Totally recommend everyone to read this
B0006JGFNQ|4.0|Got Gizmo and he does exactly as described.  I would not recomend this for small children, other than to just look at it.  Gizmo is realistic, but I don't think he is durable enough for \\"children's rough play\\" as would happen if the kids toted him everywhere.<br /><br />He sings and wiggles for his dance.  It comes on automatically when you make a noise, which could present a problem if you aren't expecting it or needing quiet.  It does have an \\"on and off\\" switch.  He would have been absolutely adoreable if the plastic ears and hands weren't a hard plastic, but more pliable to the touch.<br /><br />All in all though, being as how this is a toy, I think it is very cute and really captures the innocence of Gizmo.  I have him sitting on my desk, as I always say to my friends on Facebook.... \\"The Gremlin's are running around again\\" in referencing all the changes on Facebook that takes place.  LOL.<br /><br />All that's needed now.... is to dress him up like his \\"Rambo\\" character and we are set.... LOL.  He's a cutie!! LOL!
B002C6A6N6|3.0|Great disc set but we discovered one of the discs was cracked in the 4th season.  By this time it was too late for us to return the DVD to Amazon.  Therefore, we missed out on 3 episodes.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|Thank you, Nelson DeMille! I wait for his books to appear and this one is the best so far. I started laughing from the first page and John Corey and his wit hasn't let me down. Who but DeMille can make us laugh about so scary a topic as terrorism by lunatics. But he does, at the same time he scares the reader with information.<br />A great read!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|thank you for such a great app!!! just what I need... it's perfect and easy to use and its convenient.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|A great book, or guide i should say, for those who want to believe in zombies and know how to handle any situation.  just about every scenario imaginable has been covered in this survival guide.

B0072S9KU4|3.0|a very simple plot with lots of blood and guts.while very little character background is needed for this story it still manages to keep your attention/ whether by the literal blood and guts seen or the fact that the nazi ss did openly pursue such legends and folklore.
B0041KBWM0|1.0|I could barely get past the the half way mark of this insipid tv show. Horrible acting and just plain boring
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|As all of the Rick Riordan books on the adventures of Percy and Gang, they have been wonderful, you feel like you are part of the adventure, I could hardly put my kindle down, it continues right on and even if you have read the last book and it is awhile till the next one comes out, you just seem to fit right in.  I love Rick Riordan's imagination and the reason he started all these Percy adventures for his son, I also read an insert on the Son of Magic, which was written by his son, it was fantastic, I hope to read some more adventures written by his son Haley.
0684857219|5.0|This is really a great book. Gives you a little back ground and a lot of great knowledge. It is not just for those who want to compete but really for anyone. I've been lifting for almost 2 years and I have drastically improved my routine from reading this. Highly recommended. Only downfall of the book is that the binding sucks
B0054R6BFM|3.0|I  had heard about this by a friend .I felt it wasn't what I had thought and feel it would upset those involved. The main people deserved knowing about it but the outling people would be made to feel badly when they didn't really know their involvement.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A little slow at first but all makes sense when you reach Part 2.  Amazing story, after reading the book I visited the zoo with a whole new perspective on the animals.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I got this game so that I could become familiar with it, and play it enough to wow my grandsons.  I failed!  And I haven't even been near the boys yet!  I figured out the first level pretty quickly, and happily went onto the next.  Thus far, and it's been over a week, I'm stumped.  Oh, I've no doubt but that I will get it--eventually, but I didn't want to spend so much time on it!  I wish I could just play a different level when I wanted to!  If a 60 year old can get this frustrated...what about the 6 years olds? [and I've 3 at that age!]  The boys may love the idea of Angry Birds, but now I understand why their attention span is so short with them.  I believe this is a design flaw.
B003VANOFY|4.0|A very good headset for its price, the sound quality is brilliant and the 3D capabilities are really good. The only downside for this headset is the built quality, I get this feeling that it might break so easy if I hold it wrong or something it's build is not really that great but I love how it fits my head though. Other than that, it is an excellent headset as I mentioned before. I recommend it if you care about the price with a great sound capabilities for gaming..
B004LROMSO|4.0|As many have commented, it is a good watch overall, and it's hard to fault over 500 minutes of Eva Green. The woman brings the story alive, something she's rather adept at doing. A little more info about the music for this series would have been nice, yet overall the production is a good one and it's too bad a second season seems to have fallen by the wayside. Boorman's \\"Excalibur\\" is more faithful to the Mallory tale, but in a way this is comparing apples and oranges. Most viewers certainly won't be bored...
B003G4W49C|5.0|Beautifully written with dead on insight into the mind of a child with a superior intellect who understands that<br />the world is not a simple place.
B004GJ1XU2|5.0|i just love, love, love this movie...the soundtrack and all!! Can watch it many times!! I saw this movie when it first came out in the 80's...and continued to watch it over the years, and it still moves me.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book and could not wait to get back to it whenever I put it down. While the chapters go back and forth between a he said she said type format my opinion about what was going on changed every few pages. It's been awhile since I had a read like this.
B00448SE4S|3.0|Movie is entertaining but gimmicky. Main character is not likable at all. The whole thing is built on awkwardness. A lot of jokes seem forced and way longer than they should be. I would say that it is worth $3 to rent.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|A low key, sort of, Jack Reacher novel. Very entertaining, but I can't get it out of my mind that Tom Cruise is going to play Jack Reacher. If memory serves, this novel describes Jack several times as a big, big man. Go figure...
B009AMALGM|2.0|...but this new film doesn't hold a candle to those movies.<br /><br />I remember watching the first Paranormal Activity back in 2009 in a crowded theater in San Antonio. Up until that time I'd never truly been scared by a movie before, except for with The Exorcist and even that wasn't all that scary. Paranormal Activity was the first movie to truly frighten me and cause me to lose sleep. The second film was much the same except much, much scarier. The third film, although it went in a different direction then the first, managed to breathe new life into the franchise and give us some unique and innovative techniques in order to deliver scares in a different manner than its predecessors.<br /><br />With the fourth installment of what is otherwise a great horror franchise the creators seem to have taken all the criticism from the first three movies to heart, specifically that there isn't enough action, it's too slow, and nothing really happens until the end. To compensate for all the haters, they decide for this film to go all in from the very beginning. No longer are we straining our eyes for multiple nights simply to see a door movie a LITTLE bit, or a shadow cross over the camera lens, or for the pool robot to climb out of the pool inexplicably. The agonizingly slow build up and extreme tension that made the first three films so great (for those of us that actually enjoyed them, that is) is replaced with a more upbeat, fast pace scare more reminiscent of mainstream horror films then its independent roots. Even for its two hour running time (approximately) the film seems rushed as it tries to cram in as many creepy scares as possible, all at the expense (in my opinion) of pacing and tension. I thought the first and second movie especially were extremely good for the very fact that they gave us so little to work with; a bump in the night, a squeaky door, a chandelier swaying ever so slightly or a pan falling from its rack. I'm not going to give away the scares in this movie, but I will say they aren't nearly as subtle as before.<br /><br />Another thing that somewhat lessened the scares in this movie was that it relied a lot on the people in the film to deliver the scares and not the \\"entity\\" from the first three. Sure, it makes its appearances and does its usual \\"activities\\" but to a much greater degree than in the first three it uses mere mortals to do its dirty work. I don't know about you, but no matter how scary you make someone's face look, it's not NEARLY as scary as some paranormal entity. That's not to say that \\"Toby\\" doesn't do his share, just to say that he goes to the bench way too often instead of stealing the show for himself. At the same time there was very little innovation with this film. The first movie took the POV angle and ran with it, the second film expanded it with more cameras, and the third gave us that great rotating camera work. Besides a nifty little trick with an Xbox Kinect there isn't really any innovation to speak of here. It's pretty much the second movie with computer camera's taking the place of security camera's, and a Kinect. Nothing special, nothing new, and nothing worth speaking of.<br /><br />This far into the franchise one would normally expect the series to be wrapped up by now, or at least to have some of the major questions answered. Unfortunately this film doesn't wrap up anything, instead it merely sets the stage for ANOTHER movie that will no doubt be coming out sometime next year. More questions (and really baffling ones at that) are raised by this movie then answered. Don't expect to find out what this coven is up to, what kind of deal they made, WHY exactly this entity wants Hunter and what it intends to do with him, or anything. Practically nothing is explained while more and more mystery is piled on us in order to make us watch the next movie. I don't want to be spoon fed answers like horror movies are want to do, but a little clarification would be nice. Just a LITTLE bit,no?<br /><br />On the plus side, the last ten to fifteen minutes of the movie are, as usual, very scary. Not AS scary as the finals for one, two, or three, but still scary. The characters aren't really all that great except for the two leads (Ben and Alex) were decently acted. The parents were nobodies throughout the entire movie, barely putting in any face time and only serving as cannon fodder for the entity and his minions. They seemed to merely fill in roles instead of playing actual characters. They might as well have been props.<br /><br />In conclusion I must say that this movie was a major letdown. I loved the first three films, with the second being my favorite, but the series has lost steam. If you're a Paranormal fan like myself then its worth a watch when it comes out on video, but definitely not anything worth speaking of. Sorry guys, it just wasn't that great.<br /><br />Replay value; low.no?<br /><br />On the plus side, the last ten to fifteen minutes of the movie are, as usual, very scary.

0307744434|4.0|A thickly written book - both in character and in length.  Similar to other reviewers, the book didn't hook me at first the way I'd expected on other reviews.  It had a long build up in the 1st half before taking off - lots of groundwork being laid, and lots of singular threads which took quite a while to start to weave together.  I set it down and read another book before heading into the 2nd half of the book.  The 2nd half was all hook and I had a hard time finding stopping points - the descriptions were enthralling, the sense of being there and being nowhere at times, the whirling sweep of the competition between the two sides.  I loved this book in the end - it carried the sense of modern, urban fairytale that I favor (think Narnia or DeLint); it also had some very sharp, heart-pulling moments which caught in my throat.  It wasn't the lovey bits - but the bits that dealt with being open to other people or feeling intensely isolated from others that really were spot on.  \\"Unless wind and time have taken her away...\\" Winning book, give it time, let it build... but don't let go of it.

B008O9V4C2|5.0|After hearing it about six times through I am convinced this is likely one of his best ever.  Two times listening in the car, two from a stereo attached to a computer and now two times through with a decent sound system (vandersteen 2ce, oppo etc) and I am blown away.  Each song is sterling with the exception of the Hayes cover which gets a B and is simply out of place.  He maintains the classic Fagan/steely dan sound but takes it a step farther and starts to introduce some new textures. Truly excellent use of horns. Maybe a little more negative space. It never seems overloaded or bloated.  The recording itself is excellent.  Voices stand out, separation is great, soundstage is very good and solo instruments are front and center clear and crisp.  If you can't tell, I am loving this disc.  Buy it.  Damn.  Kudos to Fagan for his incredible creative stamina! He has literally been doing this for years.  Hooray for Fagan! Hooray for old guys!

B009CPJHY4|3.0|Predictable and bit sappy. Some good performances. Disappointing script. English retirees move to Indian Hotel for Seniors in order to stretch their limited retirement incomes. Hotel manager has forbidden love affair with an employee in an Indian call center. Its a comedy with melodramatic elements and a little Bollywood thrown in for good measure.

B005GG0MIS|5.0|An interesting and very readable history of the relationships between past and current presidents. For me it was quite an education in politics and such an appropriate subject for the current election year.  Nancy Gibbs certainly has done her homework and translated what could be a very dry subject into a page turner. [[ASIN:1439127700 The Presidents Club: Inside the World's Most Exclusive Fraternity]]
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Good reading. Not very deep as Foucault Pendulum by Umberto Eco. But with funny suspense, interesting entourage, and love to books. If you are book fetishist then read this book. And if in addition San Francisco waits you then read this book too.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I almost put this down because of it's strange beginning.  I didn't know what was happening in the story.  Once it was revealed to me the substance of the book, I couldn't put it down.  Amazing and thought provoking topic. I recommend this book, but caution you to get through the first part.  If you do, the full impact of this book is stunning!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I hope Hugh Howey is starting to attain the success he deserves as an author.  I dabble from time-to-time in post-apocalyptic literature and most of it is singularly unimpressive.  The Wool series however is something of a tour-de-force for a self-published author.  It is not so much the essential idea, which is not particularly original, which distinguishes this series but rather the writing talent of the author.  Hugh Hovey has a gift for language and characterisation that puts his work leagues above much of the lamentable rubbish that winds up on bestseller lists, earning millions for their lucky but clich&eacute;-prone authors.  In contrast to much undeservedly more popular work, in Wool, there is a richness, believability and emotional force which is exceedingly rare and hard to find- and all the more precious for it.<br />  Wool \\"works\\" because it is character-driven and constructed around an engaging emotional core.  The characters are very well thought out and there is an uncommon sense of \\"realness\\" about them.  Reference to details of mechanics, agriculture, architecture and social engineering throughout the text reveal an admirable familiarity with a range of professions and practical skills that ground the characters in their world, and the fact that the author has evidently considered the full infrastructure and conditions of life in his dystopian future environment also lend a compelling plausibility to the scenario.<br />  I would strongly recommend the \\"Wool\\" series to anyone who likes their sci-fi believable, realistic and peopled with well-formed, emotionally-engaging characters and I wholeheartedly wish the author the greatest of success in what I sincerely hope will be a long and distinguished career as a writer.
B0095R64AO|3.0|It was worth watching but there was a point when I wanted it to be over already!I like both main actors and that is why I chose this movie. I understand it had to be a bit longer because of the 5 year thing but still to long.

B007THA4FI|1.0|I started reading the book and got about 6% in (reading on Kindle) but ended up stopping.  I am a huge Harry Potter fan and was so excited when I heard J.K. Rowling was coming out with a new book, but it turned out to be a bit of a disappointment.  I knew this book wasn't a \\"kiddie\\" novel, but the amount of foul language and vulgar content still took me by surprise.  She's such a good writer with out all of that, so I just don't see the need.  Maybe the story would have gotten more interesting if I had continued reading, but I had had enough by 6% and didn't care to find out.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|always wanted to see Taken but just never got a round to it.  I am happy that I finally did it was a very good movie
B00992CF6W|4.0|this app is ok. it is not as good as the xbox or the computer, but it is still really good. I wish they would lower the price a bit and add lava, and night on creative mode. other than that it is a good app.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Since I bought this book, I continue to try and get into it.  It jumps around and just doesn't grab me as a reader.  It's hard to know if you are in the past or present and sometimes which character you are reading about.  I would hesitate to purchase any other books from this author.
B0085MNZ66|1.0|Flow is very similar to this game, and its free, and it has over 600 free levels.  I will not be paying for this.
B003V9OCIS|5.0|Robbin Simmons' review is spot on. An incredible piece of filmmaking - they even got the score just right. I was pinned to my seat, and felt like I was there...to the point that I even had to look away a few times as the tension become too much. Brilliant acting, and a new bar for cinematography; the direction is superb. So glad we watched it, highest marks.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I only wish you could play longer without having to stop and recharge :)  Other than that, I am really enjoying this game and would recommend it!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|love this game. I have put it on two devices and keep draining the phone battery. I recommend it to everybody
B006OOHYIC|5.0|It's beautiful and relaxing, and simultaneously challenging, but for every one you get right you get coins that can be used to solve (or help) with ones you get stuck on. Me and my boyfriend have it separately on our phones and love playing it together!
034580404X|5.0|The product arrived according to the delivery date, which I was very grateful for. The read is a wonderful read and I can't put the book(s) down. I would definitely recommend this product to others, in fact sending some as gifts for Christmas, and the price is reasonable!
B004EK91LQ|5.0|i have seen all of the step movies very good,very amazing dancers love all the music,very good story behind the movie hopefully there will be a step 4
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Just loved Supernatural: Complete First Season. It is so addicted. And the characters aren't bad looking either. LOve following the characters around on their adventure. This show is so addicted. I have already watched the Second Season will definitely order more seasons in the future.
B005HPY8LU|5.0|Love her voice and the melodies.  The music is upbeat and the lyrics are real.  I buy all of Kelly's albums and have been a fan since she won American Idol.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|This product is awesome I just love it. Can't get enough. Will definitely order more. Me and my husband are so addicted to it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is the true story of what happened from a boots on a ground point of view. With no need to listen to the politicians, just read this book for all the truth you need. Over all a very easy read.
B0091REZMW|5.0|great game.  this is exactly the kind of game i have been trying to find for my kindle fire.  plus  it is free. but i would have paid for it.  its that good.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|this app pops up every time you plug it in even when your watching a movie or book on your tablet
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Like all Ken Follett books, the huge amount of research and the detail is unsurpassed.  One can feel the pain and the joy of the families involved the the war years. The detail of the countries and the peoples lives are very good.  I highly recommended this 2nd book of the trilogy.
B005NFW1JK|5.0|Best show on TV hands down. This show surprises me every week what new adventure will unfold so well written. I highly recommend this show to someone wanting to watch a intense nerve raising show.
030758836X|2.0|This story is intriguing and interesting BUT the lack luster ending ruined it for me and left me feeling very sad.
B0091REZMW|4.0|slow to move and slow between scenes...could be really fun to play. I will play more to see it progress in the next parts.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It wants the best written book and it had a lot of cheesy sayings but the story was good and kept me reading
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|Consider this book a good mystery...could not figure out the villain until exposed in the story.    Wished the characters were more developed, however the story held enough interest and that you want to see it through to the end.
B007THA4FI|1.0|A big disappointment . The plot is lost in the never ending discriptions of place and characters.  few memorable characters , and it was hard to keep up with who is who. The plot is weak and silly.
0788812408|5.0|This was a great value and quality movie. It is in perfect condition. No negative comments for this seller. Everything works just fine. My niece loves this movie and so do I.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|One of the perfect Casual Games out there. can pick up and continue on at ay time. each round goes pretty quickly. Great balance between easy/hard. After you finish all the multiple levels they repeat, but even harder. Nice variety and graphics music.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|i just loved this book there isn't much more to say then that i actually enjoyed the story more then 50 shades series and this is coming from a huge fan of that series
1611761565|5.0|The author provided a realist view of what becoming a Seal and remaining a Seal takes.  The most exciting part was the preparation and execution of a special operation that removed one of our most dangerous enemies.  The author not only gave the reader the opposition faced by the emeny but our own country.
B00340ESIS|5.0|My screenwriting teacher assigned this book, I bought it online and so far I can't stop reading. It is crispy, funny, and at the same time teaches you what Hollywood really expects and also the development of being a good screenwriter.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|All of Fagen's solo albums are great, AND it must be said we are lucky to STILL have him around and cranking out a top shelf album like this!...helping  us all get through the cultural wasteland of 2012.  It borrows a little from other Fagen/Dan but takes it's own route. Of course it'll grow on you! To me, it is warmer and less antiseptic than some of Kamikiriad and Morph (though parts of those are more melodic in spots than Condos ever gets)...and I like the drums and the myriad of Leonhart horns and Fagen keys...
