0374531269|3.0|I'm ok with the purchase. Maybe I was expecti it in better conditions. Also the pages were dusty, it a only takes a few seconds to wipe and dust off.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I got this app for free and I have to say I was instantly addicted. It is the best game I have on my kindle and is much more fun than any video game. SUPER addicting, you strive to play hard and get cute little Om Nom his candy. I let my family members play and they were instantly addicted as well. This game is so well thought out and ranges from easy to hard, makes you think. Best Kindle Game EVER!!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Great artist with a message to tell. Hope his third as yet unreleased album see the light of day. Love Sixto's music
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|The theory is good. Some of the experiments didn't work for me, but maybe they would work for other people.<br />This is a good book- worth the price.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|If you love the hunger games and divergent and the selection and tales of dystopia then you would really like this book. However it does sort of seem like a repeat of that sort of dystopian fiction with the boy that you can't be in love with and running away together and etc...but in general it is a pretty good read. I would recommend it.

B003FNWR6Y|5.0|Firstly, I would like to say that if you like Monopoly and you like Nintendo, you're going to like this game.<br /><br />With that being said, I feel like some of the spaces chosen could have been more well thought out, and the same is true for the tokens.<br /><br />Now, when it comes to the Community Chest/Chance (deemed \\"Block\\" and \\"? Block\\") things get rather questionable. These cards weren't at all inventive and were very lacking in creativity. They all do something exactly like the original cards, which is understandable - Monopoly is a game that has been fine tuned for almost a century; it just works. But \\"You inherited a castle, receive $100\\"?  What?  I played Super Mario Bros. as much as the next guy (probably a lot more actually), but while you went into castles to defeat enemies, and it's a somewhat recurring theme in the older games in the series, what does anything have to do with inheriting a castle?  Most bothersome is that while the board has characters from all over Nintendo's line-up, these cards are 100% Mario related. Luigi and Peach barely even appear on them, it's almost completely Mario himself.<br /><br />In my personal opinion, with what they ended up doing with this game, it would have been much better to have simply made it Mario Monopoly, making the properties actual locations from within the Mario Universe, rather than buying Characters for people to stay at, and houses/hotels (which look exactly the same as the original game, but are referred to as \\"power-ups\\" and \\"invincibilities\\" respectively) for those characters. (yeah, it doesn't make sense).<br /><br />I think if this game utilized the full Nintendo Universe, instead of just adding some characters to the board as a gimmick, it would be the best version of Monopoly out. But as it stands, it's still a great game with a fun little change of scenery.

B00632HWOG|5.0|I use Yahoo! Mail on my desktop and prefer it on my Kindle Fire HD, but had used another application prior to this download. I was not happy with the other app, which frequently did not work as expected, but had instant success when I began using Yahoo! Mail.

B00479SVBU|5.0|Excellent fm transmitter - clear sound quality with almost no static / hiss which seems to be a problem with other transmitters I've tried. I wanted the sd capability so I could play all my music without having to connect my phone or other device. The folder selection buttons on the remote make it easy to choose between my stored music collections. I commute an hour and a half to work and don't have to change frequencies - works great! The bookmark feature is also handy when listening to messages and or books.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|This is my favorite weather app. It gives you the current weather along with the hour by hour forecast and 5 day forecast. It's also very accurate and updates the weather when it changes. You can view multiple cities as well. I've tried other apps, but they just weren't giving me what I wanted. For this being a free app, it's well worth it. I highly recommend it!

B0076794IO|5.0|I loved how the plot unfolded. At first, the fact that the narrative kept jumping to different periods of time was a bit confusing but once you adjust to that, you can't stop reading and as each new twist is revealed, you get more and more engrossed.

B002QP145C|5.0|Wanting to know more about Finland and its wars with Russia, I took a chance on this film, based on the excellent Amazon reviews.  It is a very high quality film.  The great review are all true.  This is one I plan to watch again and again.  Too bad I had to buy the twin-disc DVD set to see it.
B000SGSU58|4.0|Fantastic mystery book.  The author did a great job at showing the reality of police life; it's not all peaches and cream and sometimes you can't tell the good guys from the bad ones but unfortunately, that's reality.  It's interesting to see how things work from the inside out and how the author was able to grab the public's opinion of the police so well.<br />The way the author wrote the story left you at times wondering and second and triple guessing yourself when it came to \\"who did it\\" and that makes for a great read.  There were a couple of times in the book where I thought about the person who ended up being the killer but the author had the characters typed up in such a manner that you couldn't be sure and after a few more pages you began thinking about someone else that the author wanted you to think was the real killer but in the end was innocent.
B001DJLD1M|5.0|If you like The Matrix movies, then this is for you. One thing you need to consider, though, is that it's not four separate discs on little plastic racks, or on one very large disc, it's four discs stacked on top of each other.

1427201439|4.0|Dune is to science fiction what The Lord of the Rings is to fantasy, and it's easy to see why.  No one can match Tolkien's ability to create a species, or race, of people, and make them so interesting and believable, but Frank Herbert comes close.  In Dune, Herbert created the Fremen, the Sardaukar, and the Bene Gesserit, and gave them each a complete history: politics, religion, and mysticism.<br /><br />What Herbert did for these races, he also did for the planet Arrakis, better known as Dune.  He gave Arrakis a complete and balanced ecology, all of which hinges on the all-important spice.  Using the desert planet, Herbert also gives us some valuable lessons about environmentalism, especially in regards to water conservation.  In Dune, Herbert seems to be saying that we have the power and knowledge to make our planet a utopia, if only there were not so many people who were interested only in profit.<br /><br />Dune is the story of young Paul Atreides, heir to his father's Dukedom.  Until, that is, his father is murdered by a rival and Paul and his mother are forced to flee into the vast deserts of Arrakis.  It is in this harsh environment that the boy will become the man who will lead the oppressed natives, the Fremen, to victory, earning them the right to their planet and earning Paul a right to the emperor's throne.<br /><br />This particular copy of Dune is a multicast audio production by Audio Renaissance, complete with sound effects.  The main narrator is Simon Vance, whom you are probably already familiar with if you're an audiobook fan.  Other voice talents include Scott Brick, Orlagh Cassidy, and Euan Morton.  I'm not sure which narrator it was, but I especially liked the guy who read the parts of the evil Baron Harkonnen.  That guy sounds so much like James Earl Jones they could be brothers.  I kept waiting for him to say \\"Paul, I'm your Grandfather.\\" in that rich, Darth Vader voice.<br /><br />As far as the sound effects are concerned, I thought they were well done.  Sometimes sound effects can be distracting, but these blended very nicely with the story.<br /><br />You can't miss with this one.  Great story, great narrators, and great audio production.  Dune is a no-brainer.e well done.  Sometimes sound effects can be distracting, but these blended very nicely with the story.<br /><br />You can't miss with this one.

0345803493|3.0|Not quite as noteworthy as Fifty Shades Of Gray, but a good enough read to prompt me to buy this title. Passages like &#34;walking across the street&#34; and &#34;five story building&#34; seemed to add nothing more than 'filler', but the main content was interesting enough to keep me reading thrpough the final chapter.

0385736002|3.0|After reading George RR Martin's game of throne series, I was looking for something to replace it. Maybe I'm spoiled by the high quality of Martin's writing but this book comes no where near it. Lots of reviewers online recommend this series highly so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I'm giving it 3 stars because I am still reading and hoping that , somehow, the book will get better.

B00B6KJ0AE|5.0|This album is an excellent modern version of the late 70's bluesy hard-rock style perfected by AC/DC.  The guitar riffs are strong and the production is raw and energetic.  Anyone who liked Krokus' album \\"Once Vice at a Time\\" or AC/DC's albums \\"High Voltage\\" and \\"Let There be Rock\\" will find an instant familiarity in these songs.<br /><br />Also included is the 80's style power ballad \\"Help\\" (a cover of the Beatles song done at about half tempo) which is a very good song on its own but sounds a little out of place in the middle of the other songs.<br /><br />One of the few albums where I can honestly say there isn't a single bad track.  Absolutely essential for AC/DC fans (it could easily be thought of as a collection of unreleased Bon Scott tracks) and highly recommended for people who like KISS, Led Zeppelin, etc.  Krokus has created a classic album that will stand the test of time.

B00DW5IM9Q|2.0|I suspect the reasons Self Portrait is one of my least favorite Bob Dylan albums are shared by many others. 1. The greatest songwriter in popular music decides, for the most part, not to record his own songs. 2. The man who has one of the most distinctive and expressive voices decides to sing in a way that is mannered and inauthentic. 3. The songs that he chooses are often mawkish and unmemorable. 4. The songs are often over-produced and sweetened too much. On the other hand New Morning is one of my favorite Dylan albums; it would probably slide into my top 10 nicely. Great vocals, songs, and performances.<br /><br />So I was pretty excited for this latest version of the bootleg series. I thought Self Portrait may get a shot at redemption and New Morning a bit more illumination. After listening a half dozen times I'm not overly impressed. There are a few songs from the self portrait sessions that are very nice - This Evening So Soon, Copper Kettle, Thirsty Boots, Alberta, Pretty Saro, Spanish Is The Loving Tongue and a few others. Dylan sings these quite nicely, even if they are marred just a little by his Nashville Skyline voice. Others (Little Sadie, Railroad Bill, Tattle O'Day and the like) are insubstantial and have already worn themself out for me.<br /><br />The New Morning Tracks are a mixed bag. Went To See the Gypsy and Time Passes slowly have some nice alternate versions, although in my mind they are not up to the released album tracks. There are a couple horrific New Morning songs though - Sign On The Window \\"With Orchestral Overdubs\\", which is just as bad as you would think it would be. It's the 70's Holiday Inn Lounge version and I'm trying to forget that it exists. The juiced-up Time Passes Slowly #1 is almost as bad. And the New Morning \\"With Horn Section Overdubs\\"?!? - sir, just step away from that mixing desk.<br /><br />Other tracks on here are pretty good like the When I Paint My Masterpiece demo and a new (even to collectors) Basement Tapes songMinstrel Boy. These are nice for completists but hardly revelations. This is the Bootleg Series release that most lives up to its name. It plays just like a bootleg - gems mixed in with dross (lacking though compared to real bootlegs like The Genuine Bootleg Series).<br /><br />So I'm glad to have this material. I popped about 15 of these songs onto my ipod and the cds will now gather dust for a few years. This set does redeem the Self Portrait era slightly and show what Bob was getting at. But compared to Bootleg Series releases like Volume 1-3 and Tell Tale Signs - both filled with genuine masterpieces - this one was a swing and a miss.

B0052AC8C6|5.0|This began as an interesting and nicely animated story of a quirky character who wasn't sure how or who to be, but loved to go for it (whatever it may be at the given time) with his all. This was nice, and multidimensional, and he was funny: all of these are good things. The story developed with real feeling, along with enough humor to keep me smiling, and played out almost as it should have, and even had a few unexpected twists.<br /><br />I was expecting a simple, funny, Johnny Depp-as-a-lizard cartoon; I got a thoughtful story that I loved.

It has the romance with some steamy scenes thrown in.  It has an actual plot that a lot of romance novels dont have.  Plus there are some twists and turns that you never see coming that make it so you cant turn the pages fast enough!  I would highly recommend this book for a great read!

It was read to me by my father when I was seven, and for me it has always been the height of imagined adventure.

I lost of the book when I went to college, but now I've got this splendid new edition, and am happily reliving it all.

B00AHTYGRW|1.0|I don't know or care what awards this boring lame CIA propaganda film won, if it won anything, the CIA must of rigged the ballot boxes like they rig the elections in third world countries in favor  of puppet fascist regimes. To make a film depicting the CIA as a force for good in the world is morally and artistically despicable. The same CIA that flooded America's black and brown ghettos with crack cocaine to finance their illegal proxy wars, puppet dictators, death squads,  paramilitaries,  murderers and torturers all over the third world. REALLY?? REALLY??? Just because they managed to extract 6 irrelevant white Americans away from the \\"evil islamic evil doers\\" that somehow redeems them and washes away the blood of millions of non white third world people off their hands??? REALLY?? This movie is lame and so is Ben Affleck.

1594481717|3.0|A whole new mind is Dan Pink, from [[ASIN:1594484805 Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us]] fame, his earlier book. The premise of the book is that the previous century was ruled by \\"left-brain\\" analytical thinking, but that the next century will be for people who are right-brained, conceptual, creative, people *and* also left-brained, analytical. In other words, people who use their whole mind.<br /><br />The book consists of 2 parts, The first part is short and clarifies left/right brained thinking and what the author means with the conceptual age, the whole new mind and \\"high concept, high touch\\". The second part goes over the \\"6 senses\\" that will be important during the conceptual age.<br /><br />Part 1 is reasonable small (about 50 pages) and starts with the author explaining a little bit about how our brain works and a summary of his understanding of the current brain research. Then the second chapter explains the reason for the change from the information age to the conceptual age: abundance, asia, and automation (more on this later), and the last chapter of this part then explains what the author considers the next age, the conceptual age where people will need to use both their right and left brain, their whole brain.<br /><br />Let me comment a bit on chapter 2, which I found by far the worst chapter in the book. This is important as this chapter is the \\"reason\\" behind the start of the conceptual age. Dan Pink claims that the reason for the conceptual age are: Abundance, Asia, and Automation. For Abundance, I think he makes some interesting and good arguments. We're moving from an age where you have more than enough of 'things' and therefore the 'things' that you have are becoming less importance than others such as the ascetic design or spirituality. His discussions about Asia miss the mark completely (having lived in Asia for over a decade). His argument is that left-brained work will go to 'cheaper' people in Asia and that trend will continue. In my opinion, the author is missing a few key points. First, he never clarifies why \\"whole-mind\\" jobs wouldn't go to Asia? It seems as if he has the opinion that people in Asia don't have a whole mind, but only the left part. Next, of course, the labor cost is Asia is going up rapidly. Lastly, he frequently refers back to Software Development and in that domain, the amount of offshore development has probably decreased rather than increased. Also on automation, I think he is off IMHO. He is right that automation is going to be more important and that it will influence how people work but he is missing the perspective that automation actually helps people do their job, rather than just replaces their job (a view promoted by the Lean movement). I felt the base of the book was shaky, but I did agree with the fact that the \\"6 senses\\" are important and that its importance will grow.<br /><br />Part 2 covers what Dan Pink calls \\"the 6 senses\\" which are 6 'skills' that are extra important in the conceptual age. These are 1) Design, 2) Story, 3) Symphony, 4) Empathy, 5) Play, and 6) Meaning. Each of these sentence has their own chapter (each of about 30 pages) which explains the senses and gives stories and examples (in the typical journalistic style of writing). The stories were enjoyable, and the examples illustrative.<br /><br />All in all, I felt the book was ok. It was a good read, well written but didn't have any *wow* feelings or strong *aha* moments. The book did what I had sort-of expected, with the exception of the second chapter which I felt provided a poor background to the rest of the book. So, all in all, the book is an ok read yet I wouldn't strongly recommend it and if you ask me what the book was about in a few years, I'll probably have to re-read this review :) 3-stars therefore.inue. In my opinion, the author is missing a few key points. First, he never clarifies why \\"whole-mind\\" jobs wouldn't go to Asia? It seems as if he has the opinion that people in Asia don't have a whole mind, but only the left part. Next, of course, the labor cost is Asia is going up rapidly. Lastly, he frequently refers back to Software Development and in that domain, the amount of offshore development has probably decreased rather than increased. Also on automation, I think he is off IMHO. He is right that automation is going to be more important and that it will influence how people work but he is missing the perspective that automation actually helps people do their job, rather than just replaces their job (a view promoted by the Lean movement). I felt the base of the book was shaky, but I did agree with the fact that the \\"6 senses\\" are important and that its importance will grow.<br /><br />Part 2 covers what Dan Pink calls \\"the 6 senses\\" which are 6 'skills' that are extra important in the conceptual age. These are 1) Design, 2) Story, 3) Symphony, 4) Empathy, 5) Play, and 6) Meaning. Each of these sentence has their own chapter (each of about 30 pages) which explains the senses and gives stories and examples (in the typical journalistic style of writing). The stories were enjoyable, and the examples illustrative.<br /><br />All in all, I felt the book was ok. It was a good read, well written but didn't have any *wow* feelings or strong *aha* moments.

0385345054|5.0|I have read the whole book from start to finish, but have yet to make anything. However, I know that it will be easy once I start, since the templates, how-to photos, and instructions are extremely clear, and still engaging. I absolutely love the photography in this book, and the instructions are cleverly laid out and look beautiful at the same time. They're gathered together as a single tableau rather than several step-by-steps, which sounds like it might be confusing but it isn't. Love it!
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|My brother recommended this CD.  I bought it and it's REALLY GOOD.  You'll enjoy!  So many artist from this time are not good anymore.  Joe Walsh has remained good.
B00DB624GS|2.0|THEN PLAY ON (deluxe edition)the remaster! it's here! it's finally here! it's, it's.........aw damn.<br /> OK, yeah, there's not much sonic improvement on most of the tracks here from the original sessions. Some however, that were recorded at other times in other studios (GREEN MANALISHI,WITHOUT YOU,ONE SUNNY DAY)sound better. The so called first time appearance on disc,of WORLD IN HARMONY; isn't...(found on Jumping at Shadows; the Blues Years compilation)and actually, this, the studio version of that song, pales in comparison to the live one found on the Live at the Boston Tea party recordings. Plenty has been said already about the songs, the band and the man, Peter Green and it's all true. Yes, he was better than Clapton. He could stand toe to toe with EC when playing Blues and he also had that Shadows influenced lyrical side. Greeny could play big but he also could play delicate, softer passages that were amazing. Outstanding rhythm player, too.  He wrote compelling songs, covering a wide range of emotion and musical territory. On this record he introduces us to his prowness on slide (SHO BIZ BLUES), flamenco (OH WELL PT. II) and six string bass (several tracks)The man was an incredible talent, at the pinnacle of his creativity. Danny Kirwan was a unique guitarist in his own right, emerging as a solid songwriter and great foil to Green. If you haven't discovered this FLEETWOOD MAC, do so. As far as a better sounding recording? The Japanese SHM-CD import (Sony) will be available Sept. 2013. They did a better job remastering some of these songs (OH WELL, GREEN MANALISHI) on THE 1992 release, The Best of Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac (Columbia/Sony) so, keep your fingers' crossed........my rating is two stars;remaster..four and a half stars;songs

B00CL0J99K|3.0|OK, fans of super hero films, Generation X-ers and anyone else with an opinion; here we go.<br /><br />Number One - The first half of the film had me saying the exact opposite of what I wrote above. When the Mandarin called the Prez on Air Force One - I said out loud: \\"This is the best one yet\\". Which as you guessed I retracted approximately 20 minutes later. The Mandarin is an ICONIC Villan the way he was originally written. The script twist was Stupid. It is because of the tone struck right at that point that most movie goers find Super Hero movies juvenile. The Mandarin as revealed to the audience in the first half of the film, was awesome and scary. Then, the desire for a cheap laugh blew the whole thing. Alderidge should have been like Johan Schmidt in Captain America; A second banana who was trying to eclipse his boss. Nice Going, Mr. Black. You single handedly erased all the ground gained by The Avengers with the film goers who are not fans.<br /><br />Number Two - Marvel never should have taken Jon Favreau off the Iron Man  franchise. He knows Marvel, He Knows Tony Stark and the first 2 installments were perfect. When some thing isn't broken, DON\\"T FIX IT.<br /><br />Number Three - Pepper in the Armor?? Really? Come on! Lame, Lame, Lame, Lame Lame! It seems to me that too many people have gotten to wear that Armor in the movies. It doesn't matter that they wrote those stories lines in the comics..They were bad, and not worth wasting valuable Celluloid on.<br /><br />Number Four - Even if Tony had blown up all his armors and had surgery to remove all the Shrapnel (which makes sense), he wouldn't toss the chest arc reactor in the sea -  No Way.  Again, Stupid.<br /><br />Topping the past 2 Iron Man movies and the Avengers would be really difficult, but not impossible. The stories are already written, they just need to be tweeked.<br /><br />by the way, I didn't hate it. I just was disappointed - as all of you should be.

B005OP7162|5.0|This is definitely a must see.  I totally recommend that you watch the whole series. This will keep you wanting to see more and the suspense of wanting to know what will happen next.
0547884591|5.0|I actually started reading this book on my friend's Kindle, and was instantly hooked and annoyed! I would highly recommend buying the book, because you will want to flip the pages to sections you are interested in, which is extremely difficult/impossible with a Kindle. Also, the pictures and diagrams are well worth having the book.<br /><br />I have been cooking since college, and I consider myself a pretty good cook. I've rarely cooked a dish that has been inedible, and I have tried MANY versions of some favorite dishes (chili and Sheppard's Pie comes to mind.) This book tells you how to cook as if you had never stepped foot in a kitchen, and it is AMAZING! There are a few things I have been doing for years (cutting avocados) that I have relearned. There are simple flavor combinations that have blown my mind. The best thing is that the most simple recipes, which are designed to help someone who has never cooked, are incredibly good! I have been cooking a couple every night for my girlfriend, and she wants to know what alien stole her mediocre cook boyfriend and made him a fledgling chef...<br /><br />There is a lot of other things in this book, such as meta-learning, a portion of the book which makes me recall the Fieldbook when I was a Boy Scout (knots, hunting, preparing a fish I caught), and an experimental cooking section that touches on Modern Cuisine, something I only know about because I enjoy watching Top Chef. I don't know if I will ever use anything in these sections, but it doesn't matter if I don't. Timothy Ferriss says early in the book that he didn't want to create a cookbook of recipes, but to teach people how to cook. There are recipes, easy recipes, in which you make incredible food with hardly any effort which shows you that you can cook. After that, you are free to explore.<br /><br />This is the only \\"cookbook\\" I have felt was worth buying, which is why I'm writing this review. I don't know if I will be \\"learning anything and living the good life,\\" but I know I will be eating better and enjoying it!
1476727910|3.0|Emily Dickinson has been quoted above by a space alien.. This book gets a star just for that.  The book otherwise is very uneven.  As a space alien sent to take the place of a brilliant mathematician, our narrator has some obvious moments, some snarky moments, and some lovely chords on being human.  He starts a naked stranger, and this in itself is not at all new in either films or fiction.  Many of his earlier observations such as those on food, the use of clothes, and ugliness of our foreign race are cliched.<br /><br />I put this down at least three times, but the voice of the narrator acquires a certain reticence as learns to be human.  The bonding with his dog is touching .  The bonding with his teen age alienated son is done with a light touch that gives the proper time for a sea change to occur.  His love for his wife develops into a charming love story.<br /><br />So where does this leave me?  As the stars note, it's okay.  At the same time I wouldn't discourage your reading this book.  The author hits some lovely high notes, inspired as he writes in the closing notes, by his own panic attack.  Panic being a state that renders its host nearly alien in his/her own life, may be a great metaphor for this novel.  So I would give it a try.

B00B9366VO|5.0|This documentary is so much more than a documentary about Sound City studios. It shows how music is made with the work of the group as a whole. It made me realize that over half of my top albums came from Sound City.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|One of the best films by Hitchcock, and one of the most popular films ever, North By Northwest is also one of those rare films that is even loved by people who are normally sticklers for detail. No matter that most of the incidents, most of the situations, and of course Hitchcock's beloved \\"MacGuffin\\" plot device do not make sense. Every element, however unbelievable, is so well done and so entertaining that we forgive the nonsense.<br /><br />Cary Grant is New York advertizing executive Roger O. Thornhill, or ROT as it says on his personalized matchbooks. He is mistaken for a government agent by foreign spies and kidnapped with the intent of murder. He narrowly escapes, and in an attempt to find out why he was targeted he goes to the U. N. building to question the owner of the house where he was held captive, only to have the man murdered before his eyes by a thrown knife, a knife that naturally ends up in Thornhill's hand. Now on the run, he heads north by northwest for Chicago, then Rapid City South Dakota, following clues to clear his name.<br /><br />Eventually Thornhill and Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), a member of the spy ring, end up running for their lives atop Mt. Rushmore, leading to the famous scene where they are chased across the face of George Washington while Jefferson, Teddy Roosevelt and Lincoln look on.<br /><br />This is a marvelous film, mixing murder and humor as only Hitchcock could do it. The musical score by Bernard Herrmann is a classic, and fits Hitchcock's implausibly clockwork plot like a glove. A tiny aside: watch the little boy at the table in the background of the Mt. Rushmore cafeteria scene, as pistol-packing Eve Kendall confronts Roger Thornhill. Obviously they had rehearsed this scene a few times, and this kid was prepared.<br /><br />And you should be prepared too, prepared to enjoy a fine evening of entertainment with the Master of Suspense and his talented crew: Cary Grant, Eve Marie Saint, James Mason as Vandamm the spy master, Leo G. Carroll as \\"the Professor\\" at the CIA, and Martin Landau as a spy henchman. Pure entertainment, and now available in high definition on Blu-ray.  And all those things you don't know about the top of Mount Rushmore, like the road, the luxury home and the airstrip? The film will reveal them all to you. Who could ask for more?
B00005JN8Z|5.0|Excellent...like the old time spectaculars... Robert Taylor - always topnotch!  It is a movie that the family can watch without worrying about the language...
B003G4W49C|5.0|One of the best Sci Fi I have read in many years. If not for the up coming film, I would not have bought the book and be introduced to such fine story telling.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I am enjoying it but sort of tricky game, learning how to play but it is cool. :)<br />I am sure if you purchase you will enjoy it. :) I have playing this game every day and just keep coming back to learn more about the game. I do like it though even though it is a bit confusing sometimes. :)
B004PHE9F6|4.0|Grand Prix was groundbreaking when it was released in 1966. Director John Frankenheimer delivered a 70mm widescreen epic that roars with the engines of Formula 1 cars careening around the famous race courses of Europe to the accompaniment of a marvelous musical score by Maurice Jarre, perhaps best known for his music from Lawrence of Arabia. The real highlights of this film are Jarre's music, the visual effects by Saul Bass and the cinematography by Lionel Lindon. In an era before electronic manipulation was possible, Grand Prix has stunning visual effects that had to be created the hard way, optically. How good are the music, visual effects and cinematography? So good that an entire race can be shown without a word being spoken, because the sights and sounds say it all.<br /><br />The story of the racers and their wives/lovers is a bit tedious, but likely required for commercial success. The storyline follows the exploits of American racer Pete Aron (James Garner), as he bounces from the Italian Ferrari team (before the film begins), to the British Jordan BRM, to the Japanese \\"Yamura\\" team in his quest for the Formula 1 driving championship. Cameos show about a dozen of the greatest names in Formula 1, and a few get some lines of dialogue.<br /><br />Grand Prix was a Cinerama release, the biggest, widest, loudest of movie technologies, and was custom crafted for this purpose. Therefore, you really must have the restored Blu-ray release to get the full effect of this film's visuals, sound effects and music. Don't let the 4 star rating bother you, your eyes and ears will get full five-star value.

8866135879|5.0|This is a really great, durable planner. I've used one of these for the past year to keep track of college assignments and important dates like exams, as well as personal or social meetings. Since I tend to miss important appointments or forget about tests without some kind of reminder (I have also been known to show up at the wrong time when I thought I was absolutely sure of the time), a planner is essential for me. This one still looks great and hasn't fallen apart at all after a year of being tossed around in bags. I take it with me everywhere.<br /><br />The design of the pages is very functional and simple. Each double-page spread is one week, three days per page, with a few lines of space for each day. There is plenty of room to write important appointments or even a small to-do list, which I did to help organize my study time. The weekend splits the last day, meaning there's half the space for Saturday and Sunday. That's a little annoying for writing my weekend study schedule. At the very back, there is a small alphabetized address book. I haven't used it, but it would be convenient to have there if you like that kind of thing on paper. As always, there is a small pocket at the back as well for library cards and such. There is also a full-year overview at the front of the planner.<br /><br />I should mention that I'm switching to Moleskine's larger version this year. Although this size is perfectly fine and quite convenient for those who like to carry small bags, I tend to carry larger bags anyway and will appreciate some extra room to write. I have large handwriting, too, so it's a little tricky for me to write in such a small space. If I decide that switch was a mistake, I can always switch back. It's just a matter of personal preference and knowing what works for me. That said, I definitely do not regret buying this planner. If you want something very portable that you can throw in your pocket, then definitely get this one. The functionality is in no waycompromised by the size.

B00243FQFA|4.0|I absolutely loved this series! And in Season 4 was thrilled to see Colonel Samantha Carter take command of the Atlantis Expedition.<br />But, Season 5...

1451627297|3.0|Stephen King can be counted on for punchy writing and a good story. And this is no exception. The first part of the book captures your attention and moves along well. I liked the Jodie section and the romance with Sadie but you could have gotten just as much punch with 400 pages lopped off. It must be the cushiest job in publishing to be King's editor. \\"10,000 pages, Mr. King? Sure, no problem.\\" King's politics seem  oblivious to reality as well. The idea that Jack Kennedy can still be seen as some kind of knight in shining armor or that the \\"black man\\" in office now is doing as good a job as can be expected \\"all things considering\\" requires a whole keg of Dimmycrat juice per chapter to prevent you from holding the book out in front of you and saying \\"Really?\\" As good as can be expected? But King has a lot of common sense otherwise if you can just ignore this crap. But you can see where this is going half way thru and you do not need more than 400 pages to tell this story. I would normally say worth a read but 850 pages is a tough slog once you hit page 400.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book, really enjoyed reading it.  The author's narrative and descriptions of what's happening make the story come alive.  Looking forward to reading the next one.

0140135154|4.0|\\"Seeing comes before words\\" says the front cover of the book before you get to any images.  What an interesting contradiction.  The images in the book are, in themselves, nothing of particular interest.  It's the words that hold the attention.<br /><br />And the words are there to attack art history and the way art has been used as a tool of the exploitative class.  Berger is a Marxist, although he doesn't lean heavily on other people's theory in his own accounts.<br /><br />Basically, this is about how images make a world.  Images impose a world view on their viewers.  Berger wants to point out how this world view is about powerful (white) men.  (Race is not a major focus of the work, but it is taken for granted.)<br /><br />Once Berger shows that images make a world, he argues that technology makes the original more, rather than less, powerful.  He cites Walter Benjamin.  I believe that this is quite true, and digital technology has not changed it.  The original somehow gains more power from being unique.  Seeing Hopper's \\"Nighthawks\\" every day on my screensaver and in the flesh at the Whitney for a recent show are two extremely different experiences. But this power is not necessarily for the good.<br /><br />He then turns to an incisive discussion of how women are always aware of being seen and how oil paintings present women as objects, not subjects. I still find this to be quite relevant.<br /><br />Next, he focuses on oil paintings as the means by which the ruling class made permanent their claim to ownership of land and to their right to rule.  Finally, he argues that advertising (\\"publicity\\") has taken the traditions of oil paintings but applied them, not to the ruling class, but to the middle class.  While traditional oil paintings celebrated what is, advertising promises what will be.  It never celebrates what is.<br /><br />Thus, the middle class is doomed to always chase the leftovers of the rich, he argues.  While the ads themselves are quite dated, themechanism of deferred desire (buy this product and you will then have it) remains the same.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|A good read with several interesting subplots. Fast paced and exciting. It's hard to put his book down. Highly recommended
B008N9AASC|1.0|The beautiful beginning of the film did not prepare me for coldly filmed scenes of animals being confined in despair and others being driven to slaughter. I could not continue watching, but I expect that stronger hearts can hold the pain (and colder hearts will not be concerned).
B0091REZMW|3.0|This version is okay but it could be better. Although the things I don't like are in both versions.I don't like that you run out of energy and have to wait to play. I don't like that you have a limit on the number of energy boosts you are allowed to consume in a day. If I have 100 friends I should be allowed to gift all 100 of them, and not have to chose just 50 of them. If I chose to visit all 100 of them I should get credit for all of them, not just a few.

B00DYEN5QU|5.0|For a movie this awesome, basically a perfect wholesome action packed movie with good moral lessons, to get 3 1/2 stars on amazon only suggests one thing.  (It is the same with the great gatsby).  That it is simply a mixed bag of people who care to do reviews on amazon.  Youtube, on the other hand is not a mixed bag - most everyone is crazy there, but of course it depends on the video.<br /><br />It's hard for me to find a new, genuinely inspiring and positive movie anymore.  I would be proud to pay full price for both man of steel and gatsby on blu rays.  I have great respect for this film.  To me, it is the best work of team effort Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan in both their careers by far - their prior films have all had a darker grittier edge.  In my opinion, wholesome and hopeful is the only dang currency in art, the only art that carries on, aging folk say to themselves, \\"That was a good memory\\".
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|For first person shooter games are limited in the Kindle Fire HD. This one does not disappoint though.

B007REANJ0|5.0|What a great two-fer with bonus tracks to boot. If Little Richard isn't a part of your rock collection here's the chance to upgrade.. I mean his first two LP's on one disc with minimal $ investment should be a no brainer. I'm no audiophile and I'm sure someone will find some fault with the remaster but all I've got to say it sure sounds good to these ears. All hail King Richard!This is the 2011 Hoodoo Records release with Little Richards 2nd LP included plus 8 bonus tracks..this is not the original re-master stated one some of these reviews.
B00EH6SK78|5.0|Great album. All tracks are good and a few are outstanding.<br />Appetite & the cover of AWOLNATION's &#34;Sail&#34; are nearly perfect.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|if you order this then do not open it. just return it. won't cast half the time. Sometimes works but it is not worth the $35 dollars. i hate it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Entertaining and loads of fun. Use your logic in solving the different levels.<br />I recommend this app for all ages. Young and old alike.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|As a loyal Megadeth fan and someone who has seen them in concert 17 times I have a biased opinion.<br />Megadeth has only disappointed me twice (Risk, End Game) but this one threatens to be a third. End Game has grown on me lately.<br />Super Collider does have some great tracks (Kingmaker, Dance in the Rain, Cold Sweat) but for the most part it fades into the background.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|It is hard for me to find books to read because i lose interest easily but i Loved the book, every entertaining. Looking forward to read the rest of the series.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I was so excited to get the game because the amazone store never had a iron man game and I really wanted one so when it came out I was so happy and the game is perfect they did AMAZING on making this game get it now
B000FC11A6|1.0|I kept at it hoping for a sense of plot. Then when the families were finally linked up I had hope so I kept at it. What a disappointment at the ending and total waste of my time.
B0037QM8YA|4.0|I liked the story line and how she overcame many obstacles to be the best woman and mom she could be to her children.
140006922X|4.0|A glorified cut and paste fest, but for newcomers to the topic, the book provides a concise way to learn about non-traditional theories about Jesus.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Just what I wanted really fun anyone who has a kindle fire or IPad should get this game trust me it is awesome and it is only 6.99
B007SGM084|5.0|I really enjoyed the storyline in this series! It kept me wanting to read more from beginning to end. I could feel the struggles of both main characters and relate to their inner feelings. That makes the reading even better. Would recommend to anyone who is mature enough to read it!
0762449306|5.0|Life at work is not quite as dull when the TARDIS is sitting on my desk.<br />I love to imagine the TARDIS would grow to full size and the Doctor would  jump out and invite me in for a legendary journey through space and time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a must have for everybody of any age it is awesome. I highly recommend this game for everybody.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|I thought at first it wouldn't be good but it was amazing and if we're you I would get it
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Having children myself this was hard to bare at times. I can't imagine this having to happen to ban innocent young girl. Her courage is inspiring and entirely couldn't  put this book down. I wish Jaycee and her family the absolute best. No one could deserve it more.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I use this whenever I can't find my actual calculator for my homework.  I used it all throughout Algebra 2, and now I'm using it in Pre-Calculus.
B0050ZPAPA|4.0|There are obvious parallels to be drawn here between American Gods and Anansi Boys.<br />This one's better. The protagonist is less whiny.<br />1 star off (half if i could) because Atticus' voice is too young for a 2000 year old Druid.<br />I laughed out loud several times.<br />My only real issue is  I read this in one afternoon and I now have to buy the rest of the books and take next week off work.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|This book is seriously incredible. I didn't think I'd like it very much because I'm not a huge fan of Greek mythology, but I ended up loving it!! The plot takes many unexpected twists that makes the book so interesting.
B001LF347E|5.0|this is great. I had a all day marathon with season 1-3  and cant wait for season 4. much better than the older versions of merlin
B0084AXZK0|3.0|liked reading about dorian grey and how he became the way that he did he sounded so mean and powerful aswell
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Impressive.  It indicates all Wi-Fi signals available.  Aside from my own, I see several from neighbors' AT&T U-Verse Wi-Fi's.  Now, if I only can hack their passwords.  :-)
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Once renowned for songs that were usually classified as \\"country\\" without being such, Taylor Swift enters the world of mainstream pop in a very meaningful way, proving she is a versatile artist. This album features sixteen songs of a diverse nature featuring songs of a more bubblegum pop nature, the ballads she is renowned for, and songs that have an alternative rock feel to them. Lyrically, the album features songs of a similar nature to those she is known for, such as those of lost and found love. Completely eschewing the \\"twangy\\" feel of her former albums has done her well.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|thanks for having this series. started watching it on tv and had to see more. cant wait for the next series
B00CF34B2I|4.0|I love magic, and this app gave me an opportunity to play magic without the cards (for free, as the app had claimed). I'm only disappointed at the app because of its loading speed, as it was at 36% last night, and it still is at 36%. I'm using a kindle fire and I wanted a fun little game, and its downloading so slowly, a snail can leave it a dust cloud.
B001VS46DC|5.0|She is beautiful and very talented.  Plays piano extraordinarily well and is an incredible singer.  A must for those who know of Diana Krall and if you don't a wonderful introduction to her style of sensual jazz
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|This series differs from the show but it is so amazing. The books go more into just how much Dexter fakes his emotions, and how different his species is from us humans as he says. Amazing already started the next one.
B004LROMQG|5.0|watched some of this series on cable and had to get the season to see them all. they are great actors
B00AZMFO6I|2.0|The movie just started without an introduction and that is fine, but it was so choppy.  I feel that the script was just cliche's.  I enjoyed the people in the movie.  I haven't finished the movie and I think this winter when I have more time I will.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved it! Absolute page turner. Enjoyed how the author crafted each character and how they all intersected. Definitely kept the reader thinking.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Great update to an old classic, while it is free I do hate the energy waits or th effort to find it. Still very addictive, and great fun to be had. Totally recommended.
B0000549B0|5.0|our family get a kick out of Harvey.  James Stewart is a great actor. we love all his old movies.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Not since Harry Potter have I not been able to put a book down when I first read it.  This was the case with the Hunger Games.  The fact that I was reading it in such a trouble economic time for the middle class in ANY country, and seeing so many parallels in this story to what is happening in the world, made it that more interesting, exciting, and less fiction.  The heroine is not some annoying bratty princess.  She is what I hope the young women in my family become.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Wow tis so much fun. If only you could get diamonds and money as easily in real life. Plenty to keep you thinking and moving throughout the manor.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I bought the Kindle version today. Even though it's only $1.99, I'm trying to be super careful with money these days. So I'm on my phone, reading the reviews, and one reader talked in very helpful detail about the results she's had. It sounded great, but I've tried many different authors, being of the firm belief that you just have to find what clicks with you personally, so I was still hesitant.<br /><br />As I'm reading the review, I get an e-mail notification from Amazon, stating that many Kindle readers may be receiving a credit towards purchasing a Kindle book.<br /><br />Well, if that's not a sign, I don't know what is. Bought the book on the spot.<br /><br />I'll let you know what happens after I actually read it.<br /><br />Rated 5 stars for the book knowing I was reading about it. ;)
B000J103OI|5.0|I'd never had an interest in this movie until my wife insisted I watch it with her. It had impeccable acting and a compelling story to boot.
1601251505|5.0|The rules are really quite good for traditional role-playing. They offer a little more in the way of advantages for the player but retain play balance. This should appeal to players and GMs alike. It is a good system for beginners but can scale to handle even the most advanced players. Given the scope of what is included in this volume it is a fine price as well.
0743486285|4.0|I have been a huge fan of Motley Crue and especially Nikki Sixx since I was 13 years old. This memoir of his gave me incredible insight into what makes him tick and what made him almost die from being a heroin addict. His story is frightening but fascinating. The comments made by his bandmates, family, friends and other aquaintances make the story much more interesting than if it had just been his diaries. I like that with each passage printed, he and these other people comment on them so as to provide more insight into what was going on in his tormented life. However, I cannot help but wonder if some of the entries are a little embellished if not completely fabricated for entertainment purposes since at the beginning of the book he even states that several sections of his journals were completely illegible. Also there seems to be no time frame as to when other people were interviewed. Quotes are used by various people who know Nikki Sixx but we are not really told when these comments were actually made. I guess it doesn't really make that much difference but I would have liked to have known specifically when these interviews took place. The book itself is beautifully done- the pages are thick and shiny with a lovely hard cover. It is too bad that this book only covers a year in his troubled life, though he does at times talk about events occurring before and since. It is primarily set in the year 1987 when his heroin addiction had reached its worst- even killing him. He seems to provide deep insight into his situation and emerges much wiser after living through it. One statement I found to be quite profound was when he said dying would be easy for him, it was the living that would be tough. This is an interesting read whether you are a Crue fan or not and whether you can relate to drug addiction or not. It could surely be used as an anti-drug lesson.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|a great game to play my niece saw me play it &amp; wanted it on her ipad she loves it she is 7 and just an fyi you don't need a face book account. to unlock the girl Pengun you just need to hit the like on the page that comes up and its unlocked I did it that way for her and it worked.
B000P0J09M|5.0|Have always loved this movie, incredible acting and superb story. You can always expect great things from Robert De Niro.
B003TOMAPC|3.0|I have never read the comic and was persuaded to see it on video by friends. It starts slow, but builds excitement quickly. I enjoyed it enough to by the DVD and watch it again. It is influenced by Anime and Tarantino, but a good movie in its own right.
B00006FDCD|5.0|I absolutely love that feeling of being a little scared and on the edge of my seat while watching a movie that has all the elements of being a good old-fashioned \\"horror\\" movie. While I would not go so far as to call \\"IT\\" a horror movie, it definitely possesses some of the key ingredients of that type of film. And like with all Stephen King movies, we have a scary and interesting plot, fascinating characters, plenty of thrills, chills and spills and one downright creepy scary-as-hell villain in the form of Pennywise the Clown who has scared the pants off of me since I was 16 years old. This was also a made for tv movie like \\"Storm Of The Century\\" so it was not too horribly graphic and yet still scary enough to make me beware of clowns. The setting is a small Maine town where children are starting to disappear or wind up murdered. This was a two-part tv movie event and the first part shows a group of kids in the late 1950's who decide to take on the evil responsible for the missing and murdered children. The second part shows those kids who battled the evil returning 30 years later as adults to battle it again. The cast is an all-star one consisting mostly of veteran tv actors. The story is definitely creepy but not disturbing. Like \\"Storm Of The Century\\" this movie is entertaining and is a great example of a respectable scary movie that makes you want to snuggle up with a security blanket and maybe a loved one. I love being scared and this movie definitely frightens. Few other villains have left me scared enough to want to keep the light on and look over my shoulder like Pennywise. He will surely scare the pants off you. And that is such a fun sensation!

B009LQKHIO|4.0|This is a story of a young physically abused wife struggling for a new start in her recently deceased brother's home town across country from her recent home. She takes over his home along with cabins which she plans to restore and turn into a bed and breakfast. She meets and falls in love with a neighbor who helps to restore the cabins, the business takes off.  They marry and to make a long story short, all goes well and they live happily ever after. A good read for the romantically inclined, with a little mystery and intrigue thrown in.
1863514260|5.0|Started embroidering a year ago, and I mostly do outline projects, very rarely coloring in. Even so, I love this book for the ready made color palettes complete with DMC numbers. Figuring out a color scheme is far and away the hardest thing for me, and it is a thousand times easier now that I have this book.
B009P5S11G|5.0|Same as my last post, some songs are dirty, (sexually), but I love them and look forward to her next CD.
B0059XTUB8|5.0|This film touches on the true essence of Marilyn.  Her beauty, her class, her loneliness, and her madness.  Beautifully shot and elegant it's sure to touch your heart.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Downton Abbey.  Great story; great acting.  What's not to love??  Season 3 was even better!!!
B00942Y4IY|5.0|Great movie!  Really echoes what the Ancient Alien series presents as seen on TV today.  Was a great preface for the SG series as well.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|Fun, sassy songs!!! Love it when I am tired from a long work day and heading home, perfect pick me up!!
159463176X|3.0|I love Khaled Hosseini.  A thousand splendid suns was one of the best books of all time.  Unfortunately this one doesn't live up to Hosseini's past novels.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I've been getting by with the touch screen but I do get irritated when my clumsy fingers hit the wrong place. This stylus solves that. I like that there are 3 surfaces so this will last a long time. The clip is solid and holds firmly. I must say that It was offered with a dicsount coupon and that helped make the sale.
B008OJ291W|5.0|Great up to date remake of the great ELO songs that have made Jeff Lynne and the band one of the classics of all time.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|This game keeps loading new things and did not work out like it should.  It made my son upset and in turn me.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This was a wonderful movie and the ending was great!! *spoiler alert* - You always wish that the tiger would look back at the end of the movie. It's one of those movie moments that you'll never forget.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have read this series about twenty times. And every time the books are amazing.the hunger games will live on even if the series has come to an end. I think this series is great for anyone who likes a good futuristic action romance type story. If you don't like those kind of books, read it anyway. I didn't like those types of books, but I read the Hunger Games and that truly changed my entire point of view. From the Hunger Games I found Divergent and Insurgent. I have found great books for lots of people and I think that they're good for anyone who likes a little bit of action in their books. Please please please read this book!!!
B008Y5OW20|5.0|Electric Light Orchestra fans, this is a must buy.  Jeff Lynne has another great album with that sound we all love.
B002R27J1W|5.0|Loved this movie, Hepburn's best, oscar well deserved!  Alan Arkins sets new standard for movie villans.  This will be tresured in my video library.
B002YK8OKC|5.0|This is one of the funniest Christmas movies I've ever seen. I have been watching this movie since it first came out. It is a Christmas tradition.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|Not much to say, you haven't all ready read. ( Spoilers )  Only problem I had was it reminded Of the Old Spider man movies recently, with the son avenging father ,that is old ,But the Action is great. and my girl Lyndsey From Nikita ,didn't hurt anything..it was good ,the producers weren't afraid to have sex, cursing, and fun in 1 movie.. Story was about what I expected..
B00DYVU9K8|2.0|Coppola's THE BLING RING is a fascinating movie for all the wrong reasons.  It's creatively shot, well-acted, and all together a train wreck of the guilty pleasure kind.  This basically could air on the BRAVO network at any time and fit right in.  That being said, this is one of the few movies that I believe never should have been made.  Sure, it portrays our youth culture as the pathetic beast spawn of consumerism it is, but it also seems to be more of a \\"how-to\\" or \\"watch out\\" message to the Hollywood elite.  Sure, consequences are doled out by the time the credits roll, but did you know that the real subjects of this film, the kids who went on the crime spree, GOT PAID by the filmmakers to serve as consultants?!  They did, which is outrageous.  So not only did these little self-absorbed brats go on a crime spree and get the national attention they wanted - they even got paid by the same class of people they were ripping off.  It's hilariously ironic and sad.  I saw this film at a free screening and was happy to not send a dime the way of those that made this film.  If you want to see it, I would suggest checking it out from your local library.
B009RH9J7W|5.0|I ordered Amazon's case and this Marware because I couldn't tell from the reviews which I would prefer. Yes, Amazon's case is thinner and weighs less, but try propping it up to read. It barely holds a landscape position, sliding open if the surface is too slick or the angle too wide. Marware offers three landscape and three portrait positions, all of which are secure. If you're like me, landscape is for surfing and portrait is for reading. So if you want to read while eating breakfast, you need a case with secure portrait positioning. Sure, I'd love a thinner, lighter case for transporting my Fire, but when I lost my grip unexpectedly, it survived intact in the Marware case. Not sure that would have happened in the other one. Verdict: kept the Marware, returned the Amazon.
B00A27X972|5.0|Haig provides a distanced introspective view of us. This work engages the reader by helping us question ourselves. A well-written, good read.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I normally don't care for suburban mom drama but this story went beyond the genre to deliver a great rollercoaster of tension and awkwardness that felt real--perhaps because I have a friend who's teenage daughter was murdered and the killer never found and I could relate to the anguish of not knowing what to say and the palpable grief. The author did a great job of telling a traumatic mystery without getting sappy or maudlin--truly excellent
1250012570|4.0|Quick Recap:  Two teenagers that nobody would expect to form a relationship do just that - much to the chagrin of those around them.  It's a romance for those that love romance novels...and also for those that hate them.  No matter your background, this is one book you won't want to put down.<br /><br />The Plot:  Red-headed Eleanor is an overweight, frumpy, disheveled mess.  She comes from an extremely broken home, and struggles to fit in anywhere.  She's basically Carrie without the telekinetic powers.  Park is a suave, music-and-comic-obsessed Asian dude who has a loving family and a place at the cool-kids table.  These two should not be together.  But through a series of events, they end up a couple, but everything seems to be working against them, and even they know deep down that this great romance is likely on borrowed time.<br /><br />Thoughts:  For the record, I usually avoid romance novels like the plague.  I wasn't even crazy about the much loved John Green novel The Fault in Our Stars.  But Rainbow & Park was getting rave reviews from both critics, adults, and teens, so I figured I would give it a try.  So glad I did!  This story was virtually sap free.  Sure, some of the dialog was cutesy, but it was also believable.  The author, Rainbow Rowell, was not insulting to teens.  In my opinion, she has the teen voice down much better than John Green.  Throughout the novel, Rowell balances palpable tension with genuine joy, and for 95% of the book, it's entirely believable.  It's an emotional trek, but one worth taking.<br /><br />Favorite Scene:  I really loved Park's parents, specifically his father in one scene that involved handling the news of a fight that broke out on the school bus.  While Park's mother flips out, his father almost seems to take pride in his son for defending the honor of his girlfriend.  I loved the interaction between Park and both of his parents in this scene, and it was just one of many moments in the Park house that brought a smile to my face.<br /><br />If I Could Change Something:  Teens swear.  My word they do, I'm not ignorant.  But if the two F words on page one are any indication, the author isn't afraid to drive that point home.  I wish there had been a little more restraint with the profanity for the sole reason of making this book more accessible to younger teens.  Whether or not it's justified, I know a number of parents who would not allow their children to read this book due solely because of the constant cussing.  Also, the only time this book had a narrative misstep, for me, was near the end during a climactic scene where Park's father behaves in a way that I just cannot believe any rational adult would.  His father could have just stayed asleep and not gotten involved - if you've read the book, you'll know what that means.<br /><br />Reluctant Reader Approved:  For the most part, yes.  I think readers of all ages will really be invested in the two leads, as well as the great supporting characters.  The character development is phenomenal, even on the level of the small supporting characters.<br /><br />Overall Score:  I would give this book an 8 out of 10.  One of the year's best, for sure.to my face.<br /><br />If I Could Change Something:  Teens swear.  My word they do, I'm not ignorant.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I purchased a Chromecast on day one, and I have to say this is one of the best tech investments I've made in a while. The UI is simple and just works! After showing what it can do to my family and friends, they all want at least one and maybe more. If you're on the fence about buying a Chromecast, don't be! Get it!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Reference the title of this review<br /><br />The movie is a great adaptation and the visual effects were just mind blowing. Would love to see Karl Urban do a sequel; he is the perfect version of Judge Dredd.

1439190275|3.0|Half of food lists are items most people don't eat or wouldn't want to.  Good for those following the plan or just needing some guidelines.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The latest version is confusing. It's hard to navigate and is not intuitive at all. If  the opening is a splash screen it needs to go.  Have always liked and used TWC app on my Kindle but not now.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was good for the ten lvls (floors) it gives.<br />Upon reaching the sixth floor I needed assistant with the level. (in other words a walk through.)<br />Without help I was able to do in total 6/10.<br />So I do think this game was very good and challenging, I just hated the triangle of numbers in level 6, the key in the box of level 10, and a few other things in level 7 and 9.<br />Other than that, fair game, brain busting puzzles and decent if not well done graphics.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|I appreciate shows that we can watch as a family and make you feel good and think. LRC is like my current adult \\"Little House On The Prarie\\".
B000SW2ER2|5.0|This movie is potentially deep. It depends on the depth of the mind that apprehends it. There is much to be exploited. It is a film that is off the beaten path, and that path is welcomed. May the viewer not try to figure it out, but observe the choices.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It is easy for anyone to play and it is very fun to play  anyone can get into it too
B007J4T2G8|2.0|It took me a while to get through this book because of the exaggeration. Its ok. But just not my cup of tea
B005I4JG80|4.0|Easy to read. A good alternative to the hardcore parenting books as it doesn't take itself too seriously but is still full of lessons and take-aways that are easy to implement.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|For a Kindle, these graphics are amazing! I STRONGLY suggest this app. It's a fun app to pass time too... for me..
0446555002|5.0|Wow -- the 16th Pendergast novel! This one wraps up the Helen trilogy (Fever Dream, Cold Vengeance and Two Graves), and does a very good job of explaining who Helen was and why these things happened. It's a pretty wild ride, but these two talented authors pull it off.<br /><br />The book begins with Pendergast meeting his wife Helen, who he'd thought was dead, but almost instantly she's kidnapped and our pale agent performs extraordinarily as he pursues the abductors. It's Pendergast at his best, and thrilling to read. At the same time series regular Detective Vincent D'Agosta is dealing with a series of murders in New York, with a very creepy and odd killer who leaves his own body parts at the crime scenes. And in another story Pendergast's gal pal, Corrie Swanson, is in danger and decides to look up her estranged father. And in yet another story Pendergast's ward Constance has sent duplicitous Dr. Felder on a quest. It's a busy book with many concurrent threads, but it's handled beautifully and everything comes to a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />I enjoyed Pendergast in this book. He was amazing as usual, but also vulnerable, and we even get some conscious introspection, which I really appreciated. If you've found similarities between our dear Aloysius and a certain Baker Street resident, you will find more here, as the FBI agent performs almost superhumanly to rescue his wife and others who are close to him. We also get a glimpse of the agent's sanctum sanctorum, the private study that holds meaningful objects. Lovely! There are some great surprises and a few twists. I'd say this is one of the better books of the series, and I look forward to the next one.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|the potential for this game is... &infin;. that much is there. you're thinking that its already amazing. you are right but if they made time set tournrments with other players. mabie battles or minigames even both would make this mind-blowing. I am courage wolf get it.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|A good sequel. I have the animated version video tape from years ago so I wanted to see the difference. I was surprised at the new movie, it is really good viewing. Being a Tolkien fan I appreciated the closeness to the original story line. I can't wait for the follow up movie and hope it is as good as this one. I also hope the movie makers don't string this out too long either that will ruin the continuity of the plot. Tolkien fans should get this movie to add to the collection.
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|Is there only going to be a Blu-Ray version released? I would certainly like to own a complete series box set in DVD format, because I don't use Blu-ray.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|This is a fantastic body of work in the ever-changing sound that is Clutch.  Extremely enjoyable to rock out to.  It's excellent to hear such a strong album from the band!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Enjoyable game to spend a few minutes each day on<br />Easy to play not much skill requires basic graphics Nd sounds
1444737112|5.0|This was a easy read, full of charm and warmth. Bob is full of sass and can &#34;bop&#34; any dog into shape! A rare tale of organic friendship between human and animal.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|It seems to have most of what the PC version has. Took a while to download, but satisfied all the same.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A well written little book that weaves together separate lives of four families all linked by one husband's secret. Told in alternating chapters about each family and each husband and wife. I found it a fascinating and successful literary device that made this into a fast-reading page-turner about human frailty and secrets.  Speaking of which I won't spoil the secret here.  But you'll be shocked!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|A bit more challenging than I expected.<br />Enjoyable in a simplistic way with very basic concepts in the pictures. I like it...but don't love it.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great show, I love this season. Can't wait for season three on amazon. Mike Ross is so very crazy  I want to wear suits all day
B0094BB4TW|2.0|You can't update moods, or have access to everything else. I can do more through my internet browser than I can through the app. Very disappointed... Needs major improvements. Crashes often. Just about ready to delete the app all together.....
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Why it isn't capable with 1G of Kindle Fire? Such unpleasant surprise from Amazon...Strange way to promote games for your devices.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|This is one of the coolest movies I've seen in a while. A 12 year old girl beating the s*** out of everybody, freakin awesome!
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|I watched American Horror Story Season One on Netflix and couldn't wait for Season two.  I ordered it on Amazon instant and was very pleased.  The same characters from Season One, but in different roles that don't seem to relate as yet.  Anxiously awaiting Season three to see if it comes together.  I now have my daughter hooked on watching the series.  Very on the edge of your seat with suspense!  The actors and actresses are very believable in the Asylum.
B00CNBS5XS|5.0|Was very excited that this second version came out. Packaging was very professional when i received it. It has been a good buy
1401942601|5.0|I was hesitant to picking up this product because I don't know anything about flowers.  I wasn't sure what to expect with this and ended up being pleasantly surprised.  I've been using this deck for awhile now and what a beautiful deck it is.  You don't have to know anything about flowers to use this.  In fact, I discovered while using this that every single time I pulled a card, not only did it resonate with me in giving accurate messages, but each of the flower photos are so powerful that it awakens my senses.  You know when you take a huge sniff of a flower and you suddenly feel awakened and alive and your mind becomes clearer.  This is similar to the effect that each of these cards radiates with.  I never would've thought that a photo of a flower could be such a powerful sense awakener.  When it happened the first time I wrote it off, but it happens with every single card I pull.  I love these and it was not what I expected.  It was much better!  And it's also helping me in becoming familiar with the different healing properties that flowers can give.  Sometimes when I'm feeling out of sorts I'm immediately guided to pull cards from this deck.  Suddenly my mind opens up and my senses are heightened more than usual.  It's an uplifting feeling.  This deck is pure magic.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first new Star Trek movie so I almost feel bad saying this one was way better! For those of you who always guess what's going to happen before it does get ready to be proven wrong! The story was genius and the film kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.
1481879103|5.0|Jean-Paul Sartre sprang to my mind the moment I started reading Peter John's \\"Dead Medium\\". Like the old existentialist, May Elizabeth Trump is something of a misanthrope, a medium and six feet underground. Well, in the corporal sense. Her spirit, though, is alive, not actually kicking, but in tremendous demand by those lost living souls seeking forgiveness, solace, advice, anything to get them through the dark hours of night when the dead rise from their rest and haunt us. As the old nutshell goes, everyone talks about ghosts but no one has ever seen one; Sartre, of course, ironically replaced the word ghost for love in the same epigram.<br /><br />I don't want to use the word unique, it is overused, as the Ancient Greeks noted, virtually nothing is unique, but what lifts this unpredictable ghost story from the abyss of the ordinary is that it is funny, I mean laugh out loud and apologize to the woman across from you on the train funny. A slow fizzing giggler. May Elizabeth Trump gets under your skin and in your head. I can't remember what half the girls at school looked like (they all looked the same in their ludicrous red blazers and boating hats), but Ms Trump I could draw from memory. Like Scarlett O'Hara, Lolita and James Bond, she is real - a flesh and blood ghost who we feel for when menacing forces start spooking her - an unexpected plot twist that kept me turning the pages when I should have been sleeping. When I slept, by the way, I didn't have unpleasant dreams and awoke with a silly grin plastered across my face. And that's unique.
B00DHHWYAW|1.0|The Blu Ray disc does not load properly. It takes nearly 5 minutes to load and reports a Network problem, (which no other disc encounters, I double checked already) finally the blu ray menu displays - since all the extras are on the blu ray disc it would be nice to have them easily available. Other blu ray players in the house, encountered the same loading issue of the blu ray disc. The 3D disc played just fine (although I wish the extras were on that disc.) Perhaps it would save all some $ if when you buy the 3D you only get a bluray OR a dvd. I don't need 96 copies of the same film.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|Does anyone care anymore about what a movie has to say. This movie says there is no hope in love, its no use so don't even bother. I agree that to a lost and dying world, relationships are impossible but in Christ all things are possible.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|This was definitely my favorite movie of the year. It is a must see for all ages. I can't wait for the Hobbit 2 to come out in December 2013.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|If the characters were anymore lovey-dovey it would be like reading an episode of Barney & Friends with sex scenes.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|This season was really really good! However, it was really heavy and a little sad but don't miss it! Loving Dexter.
B004RL9T50|4.0|Quick and witty with a good message. Funny and entertaining. The whole family sat around eating popcorn and enjoying a good movie together.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|It's very inspiring. So interesting learning about Christopher's opinions and purposes for his decisions. Definitely a great book to pick up.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really frustrating when you have tap EVERY WHERE until you find a place you can search. But otherwise, kinda fun.
B0093X80VQ|5.0|I loved this book because the details Roald Dahl put into the coolest book I've  have  read yet. V.C.D<br />PS, AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nice solitaire app. Effects and sounds are good, and you can choose from playing options. No hangs or glitches, so overall I'm happy with this simple game.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love Mahjong and this free app suits my needs perfectly. Several levels to test your self, and the pieces are different enough but also clear enough to keep it interesting.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great graphics, keeps challenging player and entertainment value is perfect. I love roses yet cannot hAve one of my own and more. Just love the game!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|This app is awesome, just when I pause the video, 2 ads are on it, left and right. And when I zoom out and I can comment, when I scroll down the screen goes black, then in a second it's normal again but when I type when commenting it goes black and can't see anything until I keep my hands away from my kindle. But it's still a great app to use!
B005LAII4E|5.0|Film was awesome! Fight scenes and gear was definitely JOE style! The Rock and Bruce Willis will never let you down.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|We find that this series keeps us interested as the developments unfold. The characters are brilliantly played and one does get a view of how manor houses were operated and maintained. The one area we find objectionable is the homosexual content and try to overlook the patronizing of the gay agenda that so many programs are dragging into their plots. It seems that for such a minority the gays, at times, get top billing. This show tries to keep it tame but we are forced into watching same sex kissing and suggestive situations if we want to continue watching the series. We would love the series otherwise.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|This is a totally new Genre, Never heard anything like this, Kanye has changed the game once again like he always has.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I loved it! I cannot wait to read the next book in the series. I would recommend this to others!
B005LAIHZY|3.0|Except for the red-haired girl and her mother, I found the characters unenticing. I was unable to get too much into it--probably my fault. I'm not much a fan of modern animated film.
0920236162|5.0|This classic is still terrific for us all to counteract the DIsney Princess culture. A fire-breathing dragon outwitted by a woman with wit and intelligence is a bonus!
B005D9MUWY|2.0|Read the description of this product on Amazon; and also read through several reviews on this website. Sounded like quite a good soft keyboard, so I purchased it.  (\\"Free\\" also influenced my decision ... even if I were to find it to be 'not so good'.)<br /><br />I have a Galaxy NOTE II, and so have been using the Samsung keyboard, which was the default on my phone.  This is a keyboard I have liked very much, especially the feature where it anticipates my words and sentences.  Descriptions of Swiftkey said it was better at this than the \\"Google keyboard\\", and perhaps it is; but in my short time using it, it did not appear better than the Samsung keyboard, if even \\"as good\\".  (Admittedly, having used Swiftkey for only a few days has not really been long enough to make a true comparison.)<br /><br />Another feature of \\"Swiftkey\\" that, on reading, seemed very appealing was its \\"Swype\\" feature, whereby one can 'type' just by swiping a finger from letter to letter.  Making several attempts at this, I found it to be quick, but in almost every case at least one letter of that particular word was incorrect.  Perhaps it was just a matter of practice?  I'll give them that, and perhaps in the future I'll take some time to do just that.<br /><br />Lastly, and what has, more than anything, caused me to give this product such a poor rating, was that it failed to correctly recognize some words or symbols, changing my entry to something else - in significant actions; for example converting \\"Garmin\\" to \\"Farmington\\" as I touched the space-bar after entering that 'name' as part of a Google search request.
B006S01GH2|5.0|I watched this movie long ago and wanted to have it!<br />There is a lot of subtitles, it is part of the directors style to have a narrator explain a lot of things. It is full of nice surprises and makes me feel good and happy!
B00AQTY3XA|4.0|I've been surfing since 1959. This is the best Holywood surfing movie so far. They actually combined real surfing with a good story.
0399255370|5.0|This will become a children's classic. It can be read on so many levels, adults will love reading it to the children.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Probably the most entertaining, well written and meticulously acted series in a decade. Highly recommend!! Excellent price and super fast shipping as usual.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|i promised my daughter that i would get this movie for her and she watched 3 times  in three days
B007ZM9I1I|5.0|I have had so much fun playing this game with my friends. Great laughs from all the classic moments in the show's history. I was amazed at how current some of the references are.....only going back a season or two. Great value. I'm so glad I bought this from and excellent seller as well. A+++
B000LXH11C|4.0|Recording quality is good, the music is Alan Parsons at his best. Despite being a live performance, Parsons sticks to the musical script that works for him so you won't get much in the way of unique approaches or new interpretations to his song list.<br />Nevertheless, if you are a fan of the DVD, you will appreciate the music from the same concert.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very good book you want to keep reading to find out what is going to happen, to the different characters in the book, loved the epilogue, makes you think and is so true!
B0018S6YO4|5.0|very nice cd, good music, excellant to party or just chillin' out to and relaxing, really helps when i got to clean up.
0547848412|5.0|After seeing the film I really wanted to read the book.  It is a wonderful and very moving story and it gives you time to fully take in the meaning.  it also makes you fully appreciate what Ang Lee did with the film.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|This is my favorite of the Norah Jones albums. She truly makes you feel her emotions about her life at that moment in time. The songs are dynamic and unique, the lyrics expressive and passionate. I think this album is one of her best.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game. Just when you think you have it...you don't. With every floor it gets more interesting. I can't put it down.

B005LAIIHG|5.0|This is one remarkable and very moving film.  I think it will go down as a classic.  It is a &#34;must see&#34; if you haven't already seen it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is by far one the best books I have ever read.  I wanted to get to the end to see the outcome, but was sad that it ended.  I wanted the story to just keep going.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Ah, Stephen King. Always a good read. Not one of his better books, but entertaining, as always. It was short enough to read in one day.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|This film is a cinematic masterpiece. Neil Patrick Harris shows his acting chops by pulling off an amazing Dr. Horrible, the nerdy wannabe super villain.<br /><br />Just buy this movie.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book as I have all the other books in the series.  Can't wait to see it on the big screen!

B0047SF41G|3.0|Better than the last Predator movie but was predictable.  Predator and Aliens Vs. Predators are still the best movies in the series.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Rather good movie that surprised me.<br /><br />Pacing was excellent, camera work good, effects music were good, acting was actually very good. Color choice set the scenes well, not overly dark or to clean.<br /><br />If you enjoyed quick style HK action movie pace (original Infernal Affairs) and glossy camera work this will be a fun diversion. Don't expect clever dialogue (Layer Cake) or deep political introspection out of it (Elysium). Or introspective character development (Batman series).<br /><br />Highlights that made it stand out over other action movies:<br />Characters were all competent.<br />Characters made smart decisions.<br />Female lead did a good job by not being a typical 'action movie' female. Held her own against Dredd.<br /><br />Scenario was believable in context laid out, and didn't deviate from outlined material.<br /><br />This is strictly a fun popcorn cruncher much better than the latest Wolverine movie made even better by it being free for amazon prime subscribers.<br /><br />A few silly parts but it's worth the viewing. Grab some popcorn and enjoy it.<br /><br />Buying = maybe not.<br />Free/rental = absolutely worth checking out.

B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael Buble is my motivational music. I love the big band/swing music of the 40's, and he has brought those old songs new life without &#34;modernizing&#34; them necessarily. I dance around my kitchen and clean house to him crooning. Just such a smooth, relaxing voice!!! Anyway, this is probably my favorite album of his yet... all the songs are about a sustained relationship through time, thick and thin, and just bring a smile to my face as my husband and I are about to celebrate six years of marriage. Still young and still in love! I also love that when you buy the album, you get the MP3 version. Saves me the time of downloading the cd to my computer, and I got to listen to it right away!
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Hag and Buck are two of my favrorite country artists and cannot imagine anyone else doing a better tribute than Vince & Paul. I have played this cd over and over.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Read this in less than a few days. Couldn't put it down. This is among the current sci fi books as Enders Game and Ready Player One. Fantastic to read all the spin off books by other authors
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I am not a Star Trek fan by any measure, but I do enjoy a good sci-fi. This movie was entertaining as hell, well acted, the score was great; an overall fun movie.
B009NY3CL8|4.0|A unique take on the childhood classic. Robin Williams carries this film and it's truly enjoyable. Watch with your kids.
B005IQZB14|3.0|Interesting story. Cheryl Strayed showed a lot of courage, not only in taking on a grueling hike but in sharing the intimate details of her life so many years later.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I love this game. It is so much fun<br />. I wish the energy would recharge faster. I purchased diamonds twice, I never got them and I lost $10 because of it.
B003YL4L0W|3.0|I love Jodi Picoult, but this wasn't a winner for me. One reason I enjoy her books is that they make you consider both sides of a topic. It was obvious which side of the fence Picoult was on regarding gay rights. I don't disagree that gays should have the right to marry and have children, but I didn't like how Christians were portrayed. When Max and Zoe were married, they had similar non-religious beliefs. Once they get divorced, Max gives in to his alcohol addiction and then quickly turns into a far right Christian. Zoe quickly turns to a woman. It seemed weird and far fetched to me. I haven't listened to any of the songs that went along with the book. I love music and I love reading, but I'm not interested in combining those two hobbies. Picoult has written some great novels so unless you've already read all her others, skip this one.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|I think it is a movie for the female gender; don't think most men would care for it.<br /><br />Julianne did a pretty good job for not being an actress.
1250030951|4.0|Confession: I've been a shipper practically my whole life. It must be congenital, because I was obsessing over the relationships of fictional characters long before anyone came up with that label. As a child, I didn't dare talk about it, because I thought that people would think I was weird. Ok, weirdER. Still, I knew that I couldn't be the only one, and I kept an eye out for books with characters with the same quirk. These days, of course, the internet allows millions of people like me to find peoople like themselves so they can collectively gush over their favorite ships, but \\"Fangirl\\" is the first book I've seen on the subject. And it's about. freakin'. time.<br /><br />But I didn't give \\"Fangirl\\" four stars just becuase it's about a subject close to my heart. It anything, I'm more critical because I know exactly what shipping is like. And this is a realistic picture. Our main character, Cath, is an introverted girl. She doesn't like dealing with new people and prefers the company of her identical twin sister, who shares a love for the fictional world of \\"Simon Snow\\" (think \\"Harry Potter). They ship Simon with his rival, Baz (think Draco/Harry, aka Drarry), and write fanfiction about it. But when it's time for college, Wren is ready to leave \\"Simon Snow\\" behind. Cath is decidedly not, and goes on writing her (very popular) fanfiction, \\"Carry On, Simon.\\" Things in that world are an escape from the real one that includes: her increasingly distant and increasingly wild sister; an unstable single father back home; a mean roommate; and her roommate's ever-present, perpetually smiling boyfriend. Cath does well in her writing class (and teams up with a cute classmate to boot), but her true inspiration is Bazon (it isn't called by this name in the book, but it totally should've been). Other writing feels like a chore. And her professor is not keen on the idea of fanfiction. Cath needs to start living in the real world, but how can she when she doesn't really want to?<br /><br />There's so much to love with these characters; they're so fresh and realistic. Cath's introversion rings true. There aren't any studies or statistics on shippers that I know of, but I'd be willing to bet that most are introverts. Developing characters and their worlds takes a lot of daydreaming. And of course, the worlds we create for ourselves are usually more exciting than the one we live in. How could they not be, when we create them to our own ideals? And how do you learn to care about your own characters and stories when it's so much easier to just stick to the ones you know and love? These are dilemmas I'm all-too familiar with. Some might be frustrated by Cath's unwillingness to engage, but I thought it was understandable. She's not a complete recluse, and she's not too timid to say what she thinks. She's not an insufferable hipster, either, which was a relief. Wren isn't as well developed, but then, she doesn't come into the story as much. Her partying seems to be a way of coping, though, and this was a good contrast to Cath's reaction. Cath's roommate, Reagan, was great. I loved how frank she was, and she was really funny. Most books would cast her critical nature in a bad light, but not this one. She and Cath had an unusual but totally believable chemistry, and they were fun to watch together. Levi, Reagan's boyfriend, was also a fully-rounded character. He's exceedingly friendly to everyone, and he's strangely interested in Cath's \\"thing\\" with Simon Snow (and in Cath herself). It's obvious pretty early on that he and Cath are going to end up together (the love triangle was kind of unnecessary). I appreciated that their relationship developed beyond them becoming a couple. Cath's shyness with her first real boyfriend, her worries about the difference in their maturity and relationship-experience, were so relatable. Their relationship was encouraging, as shippers commonly worry about how real relationships will compare to the pairings they love (notthat I know anything about that). The dad was another good character, very caring, but casual. He and Cath have a good rapport, and I think many teens will relate to Cath's struggle with leaving him at home. The only other character really worth mentioning is Cath's Fiction teacher, Professor Piper. She wasn't one of the best characters, but she does bring up an interesting debate about the value of fanfiction. I like that Cath finds an answer for herself, but still leaves room for the reader to draw their own conclusions.<br /><br />The story here was strong, mostly mundane events, but it brought out the best in the characters, made for interesting interactions. Between chapters are excerpts from the \\"Simon Snow\\" books and from Cath's fanfiction (the latter appears in the story some, too). These were compelling in their own rights, and made me wish that they were real works I could read. I found myself getting into the fanfiction, especially. Actually, I... I kinda shipped that. I thought it was great that Cath shipped slash (a gay pairing), as so many do.<br /><br />The writing is also excellent. Both the prose and dialogue are natural and funny. There are lots of references to the tropes and cliches of fanfiction that made me laugh out loud. The excerpts from \\"Simon Snow\\" and Cath's fanfiction capture the styles of the genres perfectly.<br /><br />So, with all that, why not five stars? Well, there are a few reasons. First and foremost, I wanted the story to dig deeper when it came to shipping. We know that Cath is into Bazon, but we never really see just how important it is to her. We know that Bazon is important to Cath because she says that Bazon is close to her heart. I believed her, because I understood how she feels. But I'm not sure people who aren't shippers will get it. We don't get to see what about Bazon first appealed to Cath, how she fell for it, how those characters grew in her mind and became a part of her. And I wanted to see her explore questions like, why is this so important when it's not, technically, real? How do you deal with the fact that fantasy is more exciting than reality? Questions like these can make a girl lonely, and, though some are answered without being asked (Cath falls for Levi without ever wondering how real love will compare to Bazon), I still wanted to see her ask them. I have some answers to these questions, but it could've been insightful and inspiring to see how Cath handled them. Not that I expected Cath to be exactly like me, but as people who think and fantasize a lot, shippers as a group do tend to ruminate. I thought it was a big omission that we don't see Cath and Wren as children, how Bazon helped them get through their mother leaving, how it brought them together. Shipping has always been mostly a private affair for me, and I would've loved to see how it worked when shared between two people. It also would've made Wren a more fleshed-out character. I wanted to know more about her in general, what she's feeling, what she's struggling with. Speaking of characters that could've had more development, Nick felt like more of a plot device than a fleshed-out character.  And I thought the issues with the mother could've been explored more thoroughly, though I was glad that everything with her wasn't wrapped up neat and tidy by the end.. Finally, the one reference to \\"Harry Potter\\" was jarring. It's kind of hard to believe that such similar series could achieve the same popularity in the same time period.<br /><br />IN SHORT: \\"Fangirl\\" is a great novel that tackles the subjects of shipping and fanfiction with much humor and affection. Most of the characters are well-rounded, sympathetic, and totally believable. In fact, they were the best, most realistic YA characters I've read in a long time. Their relationships are just as good as the characters themselves  (including a tender and well-written romance). Cath's problems and interests will be so relatable to shippers. The story is interesting, and I loved the excerpts from \\"Simon Snow\\" and Cath's fanfiction (especially the latter). The main reason I didn't give it five stars is that, while shippers will understand Cath's feelings, I'm not sure others will. The book doesn't give enough detail about how she got into it, how she felt about it then, and how she feels about it now. It would've helped a lot if we'd seen how Cath and Wren built this world together. THis also would've helped flesh Wren's character out more, as she and one or two others weren't as well developed as they could've been. But overall, I loved every minute of this book. I felt like I'd been waiting to read it for a long time.like, why is this so important when it's not, technically, real? How do you deal with the fact that fantasy is more exciting than reality?

THis also would've helped flesh Wren's character out more, as she and one or two others weren't as well developed as they could've been. But overall, I loved every minute of this book. I felt like I'd been waiting to read it for a long time.

B008RA3X5E|1.0|Upgraded specifically to get music choices test drive offered. Guess what? They're not there! Upgrade says enjoy your own music, but the only music choice is a very annoying popping sound. Test drive offered 3 very soothing instrumentals. I consider this false advertising.

B0012HF5NC|3.0|I am only giving three stars to this movie due to the advertisement / information provided regarding what I was buying.<br /><br />The movie itself is great but the way it was advertised implies the extended edition.<br /><br />When I researched to see if the duration was the same it turned out to be the theatrical release.<br /><br />It would've been a great movie if they really delivered the extended edition.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Khaled Hosseini's ability to weave several stories into one cohesive whole whilst making you care about the characters and develop hopes for them is remarkable. This novel is filled with insight and compassion. I did not want it to end and I'm certain to re-read it in a few months time, if not sooner.
B0034G4OZE|5.0|Loved the film. Honest portrayal of mental illness, if not an honest portrayal of what psychological institutions are like. Brilliant and arrived on time and in good condition.

B00DGKQF2S|5.0|The Winery Dogs self titled album is great. Not one song needs skipped over. If you like Soundgarden you will dig this band. The riffs and lyrics are great. Best of all This album doesn't even have one bad word in it. Its nice to finally hear a clean rock album. Wish more albums were like this.  Support this band for more great rock music. Which the industry desperately needs.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|So this is supposed to be a YA novel. Yet, I am 63 and found it one of the most enjoyable books I've read this year. I love the characters, especially the exchanges between Augustus and Hazel. I read fiction to escape the boring, mundane conversations of everyday life and John Green delivers in gold stars here.  Having a sister, who died of cancer a few years ago, I appreciate the down to earth approach to cancer patients and their desire to be defined by more than having cancer. The relationship between Hazel's parents towards her is admirable, funny and endearing. I couldn't imagine a better book to advise to any young adult who has cancer.  It is a book which provides courage in the face of suffering and the belief that dreams do come through. Well done, Mr. Green. I look forward to reading more of your books.

0307352153|4.0|This book was recommended by a friend, and as is my experience with friends' recommendations, it turned out to be a good one.<br /><br />Susan Cain is an introvert who discovered, after years working as a Wall Street lawyer, that she is unhappy with constantly having to adapt her behaviour to match the expectations of an extrovert-centric society. \\"Quiet\\", sub-titled \\"The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking\\", is her personal crusade against the extrovert ideal we are all expected to aspire to (especially in the USA).<br /><br />Ms. Cain covers the extrovert ideal in education - from kindergarten, where children are encouraged to work in groups and \\"participate\\", through to Harvard Business School, where the entire system is built to encourage socializing. She talks about her experiences having to speak forcibly and loudly as a lawyer to make her point. And she shows how the open-space office trend of the past couple of decades is conducive to less, not more, worker productivity and innovation.<br /><br />The book is full with quotes about psychological research (perhaps too much) to back Ms. Cain's argument for change. But even she admits, towards the end of the book, that not everything is black and white. Human personality is too complex for simple solutions, and there are many introverts among us who can adapt their behaviour according to the social situation they find themselves in. They can spend hours by themselves thinking or reading a book, and the next day they can give a successful presentation to a large audience. Yes, things can and should change, giving more attention to introverts who find it difficult to shine \\"in a world that can't stop talking\\", but the spectrum is so broad I'm not sure there is a one-size-fits-all solution.<br /><br />While reading this book I took a couple of online versions of the Myers-Briggs test, to check where I score on the introvert-extrovert scale. I won't disclose my personality type here, but I can say the result did not surprise me one bit. I guess with age comes also understanding of who we really are.the result did not surprise me one bit. I guess with age comes also understanding of who we really are.
B003V4AK8E|1.0|I really wanted to like this controller after reading some negative and some positive reviews. The finish is actually very nice. It feels good in your hands and the lighted buttons are a nice touch.<br /><br />The big problem is the dead zones in the analog sticks. It wouldn't even be such a problem if the dead zones were uniformed. Unfortunately, I can barely move the left stick to the right and get movement, but to get any movement to the left I have to move it about half way before something starts to happen. That's a pretty ridiculous dead zone. Maybe I'll take it apart and find out why this problem exists, but I have a feeling it isn't something fixable.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great to kill time and great for people who don't have a pc but they have a phone or tablet
0345803485|1.0|Save your time, save your money.  This book is awful.  It is HIGHLY repetitive and the \\"plot\\" is horrible.  Most likely this is a good first effort for the 12 year old who wrote this.  How can anyone with an IQ above 100 say this book is good?  Perhaps as a coaster?

0807029181|5.0|I bought this book because I listened to it in audio version and it so impacted my thinking that I knew I had to own a physical copy.  I constantly find myself referring to the philosophical ideas Frankl presents, and his explanation of what motivates human behavior has really helped me better relate to and understand people.  The book is very readable, mixing philosophy with Frankl's story told in first person.  Even though the book relates the author's experience in a Nazi concentration camp, his purpose in telling his story is not to impress his reader with the horrors of his suffering but instead to illustrate the things he learned about human nature through that experience.  For that reason, the book is not excessively gut-wrenching, but is quite fascinating and thought-provoking.

B0053TMP24|5.0|This is another strong addition to the series.  Frank seemed as much like the main hero throughout the book as Percy just like I felt Leo was as much the main hero as Jason from book 1 (Lost Hero)  Similar formula from book one and two and that's not a bad thing. Another Riordan book that makes me not want it to end. Good thing I have the next book in the series.
B008KMHFJY|2.0|Good for a lazy Sunday arvo, when you have nothing else to read- and by that I mean, not even your 2 year olds picture books.<br />The content is predictable and typical teen and again portrays women as emotionally retarded monkeys.

B00CPTUNBK|5.0|Despite all the whining of a couple of very vocal people, this movie is actually really good. The animation is great, the voice acting is top notch, and the story/setting is fun. It doesn't need to compete for any kind of national award, it's just a fun little movie to watch. That said, watching the show before hand will obviously make it much easier to understand what is going on.<br /><br />So yeah, people should stop freaking out about &#34;Oh noes, humans!&#34; and &#34;it's another high school movie!&#34;. Just watch it and have fun.
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|I had read the book in HS a long time ago, but I remembered how much i loved the story and was so excited to see the movie.<br />Leo WAS Gatsby. I have to say that the actors were amazing, each playing their part perfectly. Tom Buchanan reminded me of my ex husband with his \\"sprees\\" and rough mannerisms. This was an amazing love story between Daisy and Gatsby, and you hoped all would go well since the \\"husband\\" was a brute. Contrary to the desires of how the story would end, Daisy is just a shallow human being and leaves you feeling so sad for Gatsby. I loved this movie because I love the character Gatsby...full of hopes and dreams. It is sad at the end, but I still would watch this movie 50 times. I get tired of people saying that the music was not authentic. Who cares? I found the movie to be very entertaining while authentic in following the book - even the lines.<br />I love Leo! And I found this movie to reach the inner depths of my emotions and make me think about life.

B000X9ZERW|1.0|since the mid 80s I have noticed growing demand for offensive music as we see parental adversary stickers being put on records . then I the late 80s early 90s we seeing  African american artists like N.W.A and other gangster rappers use the N word in their music before long the word has become an issue as we hear kids using the word every where we go the word had to be outlawed . I have my African american friends that are very upset about it it was a slavery term .  what good is banning the word if people are going to be infewineced to use it . some of us are fed up with hearing it .
B00846REIS|2.0|Not sure why I didn't stop reading this book, but when I think about it, the love scenes were pretty great.<br /><br />Thing is I couldn't relate to Eva. I'm not sure why she puts up with so much. She is very immature and I wish I could reach through the pages and smack some sense into her.<br /><br />The grammar in the book itself is often too immature which frustrated me and made me embarrassed reading it. I didn't expect a Hemmingway novel but a few less Shut Up's would have been nice.<br /><br />Is this book for board housewives or young college kids. That's where I was torn.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Nice set for a good price. Got it in time to catch up with the season and be current with everyone else.

B000NY12CI|5.0|Hirsi Ali writes so smoothly in English, after her journey from many languages and patois of Africa, through Europe, into Holland, and now to the US, it's almost hard to imagine she didn't dream herself up, her writing is so very fine. And so is her story. Her younger years in Africa with so many moves, family changes and suffering clearly made her a strong survivor. Her educational and political successes stunned this reader. And her forthright evaluations of her understanding of Islam make me wonder that she remains safe in America, and I am so grateful that she is.. Welcome!! to such a heroine.
B005HED11Y|5.0|The remastering was certainly worth it.  Fans know that Star Trek has always been a little more than &#34;just&#34; a TV series.  Gene Roddenberry's vision has become legendary, and is worthy of such preservation efforts.<br /><br />I haven't seen the original episodes for a long time, and it's been a real kick to see them now in hi-def.  They are not wide-screen of course, because they were filmed in 4:3 for TV format.  But the details really stand out now, and the colors pop.  One thing that particularly stands out for me, is the detail of planet surfaces while in orbit.  I was amazed at how beautiful they look now.<br /><br />I also love having the entire season, watching the characters change over time as the actors settle into their roles and relationships, and build the characters.<br /><br />And just to settle an argument, while I respect Captain Jean Luc Piccard, Jim Kirk would kick his monkey butt all OVER the place, in a fair fight.  Just sayin'
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Jesus, as portrayed in the Zealot, wasn't the Christ, but an itinerant, illiterate, rural boy, young man, steeped, to what degree neither the author nor I can really know, in Jewish thought, and culture and teaching. His focus, though , as Asian presents him, is on the poor, the disadvantaged, not the wealthy among those who were elites of Jerusalem  who wanted to be thought well of by Rome. As I understand the book, Asian presents Jesus as a man who thought of himself as the son of man, a human, not an embodiment of a creator God. A scholarly and very readable book. Really couldn't put it down.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I thought the author presented the view point of right to die from the victims point of view as well as the family's point of view.  I thought the development of the characters was great.  In to many instances we only thnk of life not the quality of life, I thought that was clearly expressed.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Gladwell's comparisons and analyses of ins and outs of success, and failure, and  approaches to both, are rich with contrasts and challenging thinking. I wish I had read the book earlier, when it first came out, to keep it my thoughts for a little wise guidance. I'll read it again.

0440246008|4.0|Everyone' favourite serial killer (Mr Reacher) is on the loose again...just kidding.<br /><br />This book had an apt title as the the plots were full of twists and turns. Reacher had to use many trials and errors to uncover the real story. All in all, it's a good book. The FOLLOWING CONTAINS THE PLOTS. So If you have not read the book, you may want to skip them.<br /><br />Reacher was recruited by a military contractor owner (Edward Lane) to find and rescue his kidnapped wife from his 2nd marriage. On the surface, the Lane's business seemed to be doing well. He was flushed with cash and had a good outfits of former special forces soldiers (Marine Recon, Navy Seal, Delta and SAS) working for his corporation.<br /><br />As Reacher investigated further, he noticed that Lane's business was not as well it appeared. While he seemed to have millions in cash to pay the ransoms, those were drawn from his working capital. The Pentagon had already blacklisted Lane's corporation as a main contractor because he did an unathorise double job when they engaged his services for Panama. Hence Lane could only get jobs as a sub-contractor. And he managed to did one job in Africa that paid him 20 million by doing the bulk of the job, while the main contractor got the remaining 80% doing the minimum. The story never quite elaborate on what Lane did there, but it made him a small fortune.<br /><br />Meanwhile the sister of the wife from Lane's 1st marriage made contact with Reacher. She had been doing surveillance on Lane. That was because she was suspicious that 5 years ago, Lane being a control freak, faked her sister kidnap and subsequently murdered her when she wanted to divorce him. That triggered Reacher's interest further that justice has to be done if it was true.<br /><br />Via the 1st ex-wife sister and an NYPD cop, Reacher was put in touched with an a retired FBI speical agent. She was in charge on the kidnapping case then. She couldn't let it go as she had this lingering doubtwhether the FBI and police involvement were part of Lane's plot to whitewash him of the involvement in the kidnap.<br /><br />Being retired FBI and MP, both were able to put their ego aside and worked together. All the more now that they had no bureaucratic turf to protect and bureaucratic might to back their actions. They needed a good partner for this case.<br /><br />During their investigations, they found that Lane asked his men to kill his 1st wife and tried to silence his men by abandoning them to the wolves when they were deployed in Africa. In any case one of the man managed to survive and make it back. This part of the story reminded me of another Reacher story called Tripwire. Where someone survived in an arm conflict and returned as a \\"ghost\\" to avenge. So there was strong suspicious the survivor was behind the 2nd kidnap with revenge being the motive. However Reacher found out that the survivor was badly tortured during captivity. He became a quadruple amputee after numerous torture sessions.<br /><br />That brought to my attention on what might happen to a captured foreign mercenaries being in a conflict that were not their fights in the first place. These mercenaries were likely ex-special forces who had don their fair share of services to their nations and they might be in a conflict that required an United States presence, without actually waving the flag. However once they were caught, they would be totally on their own. No government recognition, support or allowances to their family. Truly were expected to become an anonymous soldier, from victory till death.<br /><br />Reacher also learnt that Lane's causal attitude on his crew had caused a lot of ex-soldiers deployed by him being killed and he did not give any proper compensation to their families. Like most employers, its to profit from employee's misery.<br /><br />In any case, the ruling out the survivors as the kidnappers, Reacher turned his attention back to the only person with the Lane's2nd wife on the day of the kidnap. One of Lane's man, who double up as the driver for the wife. As the driver was not contactable, his body also did not turn out and its unlikely that any kidnappers would keep the driver, it drawn on Reacher that the driver could very well be one of the kidnapers.<br /><br />That took Reacher to a tour to England to find the driver (as the driver Taylor was ex-SAS). Reacher promised Lane that he would help him haunt down the driver and other kidnappers so that Lane and his crew can extract their revenges. In exchange Lane would have to pay Reacher finder's fee $800 000 and Reacher would pass that.<br /><br />However the story took an unexpected final turn when they met in England. Like all good Reacher novel, it was fun following our hero going through the \\"hard way\\" of investigation, narrowing down the leads and discarding those that did not gel. End of the day like in real life, the truth might simpler than it appeared.<br /><br />Minor mis-forgiving on the book was the way it ended. It's a bit too abrupt and there was a lack of closure like among the ex-FBI agent and the 1st marriage wife sister. Also the remainder of Lane's money which could have been better dispense to his victims.<br /><br />However on the whole it's a good book to read and I would give it a  4 out of 5 stars.
B000AY74OG|1.0|The DVD never worked. It was defective and not worth the postage to return it. My grandson was very disappointed when I told him we were going to watch his favorite animals and it DIDN'T work.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The movie catches only a smidgeon of the excitement of the book. The oral history style of the book adds to the realism and tension of the story. I could not put the book down and finished it over a weekend. I found myself wanting more stories of ordinary people dealing with extraordinary circumstances!
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|The title of this review may be a bit cryptic, so I'll explain. In the same way that the 1976 Alan Douglas-produced \\"Midnight Lightning\\" album was an inferior follow-up to the 1975  \\"Crash Landing\\" album, and the mixed fan reception given to \\"Midnight Lightning\\" persuaded Douglas not to create any more \\"Ghost Session\\" overdubbed albums, \\"People,Hell & Angels\\" is an inferior follow-up to the generally excellent \\"Valleys of Neptune\\", and, shortly after its release, Engineer/producer Eddie Kramer announced that \\"People,Hell & angels\\" would be the last Hendrix studio album for mainstream commercial release(future studio CD's will be marketed by the Hendrix mail-order label \\"Dagger Records\\"). Granted, Eddie Kramer hasn't done anything as offensive as what Alan Douglas did, but Eddie Kramer(in doing what his employers wished) knew that that there would be fan criticism of some of the techniques used on the two most recent Hendrix studio albums. Certainly, even if he doesn't say this in public, Kramer must have mixed feelings about the creation of \\"People, Hell & Angels\\".<br /><br />  Let's be matter of fact: all posthumous Hendrix albums have to varying extents been subject to posthumous doctoring, whether it is editing of live recordings, composites of elements from several studio takes, or re-recording of the bass & drums by Hendrix's original sidemen(Yes, even some of the earliest posthumous Hendrix album such as \\"The Cry of Love\\" & \\"War Heroes\\" each had a few tracks where Billy Cox & Mitch Mitchell re-recorded their performances).<br /><br />  Both \\"Valleys of Neptune\\" & \\"People,Hell & Angels\\" each contain several selections where previously unreleased performances have been manufactured(on \\"Pro-Tools\\") by \\"Flying In\\" already released vocal performances onto previously unreleased instrumental performances. Examples of this process can be heard on \\"Stone Free\\"(on the CD \\"Valleys of Neptune\\") and \\"Somewhere\\"(on \\"People, Hell & Angels\\"). And I should also mention that \\"People, Hell & Angels\\" was one of several titles that Hendrix was considering for the album that he was working on at the time of his death. This is not that album.(Most of the recordings from the unfinished album can be heard on the CD \\"The First Rays of The New Rising Sun\\")<br /><br />  With that info now explained, I'll give you a rundown of what is on this CD:<br /><br />1.Earth Blues(This is an early version with Hendrix somewhat awkwardly singing, perhaps partly improvising, a somewhat different lyric than the one heard on the more polished and produced familiar take[now heard on the CD \\"First Rays of The New Rising Sun\\"]. It may well be that the Billy Cox/Buddy Miles background vocals may have been flown in from the polished version. The problem here, is since \\"People, Hell & Angels\\" has been given a high profile, heavily promoted release, that this inferior version may be what newer fans are more likely to listen to.<br /><br />2.Somewhere(this is a pro-tools creation, but it actually works pretty well, and this is one of my favorite tracks on the album. Hendrix only sang this song once in the studio, but the recording has existed in several forms:<br />  1. The original recording(the take over which Hendrix sang). This exists only as a mix, and can be heard only on unofficial \\"bootleg\\" CD's.<br />  2. The same recording, but with Mitch Mitchell making an awkward, unsatisfactory attempt to replace Buddy Miles' drumming. This take can be heard on the so-called \\"Purple Box\\"(the \\"Jimi Hendrix Experience\\" 4-CD box. Mitchell's efforts resulted in erasing Buddy Miles' drums off<br />  the 16-track multitrack.<br />  3. Producer Alan Douglas' doctored version on the \\"Crash Landing\\" album. This retained all of the original guitar & vocals, but removed everything else, in favor of overdubs by bassist Bob Babbit, drummer alan Schwartzberg & percussionist Jimmy Maeulin.<br />  and now....<br />  4. In order to obtain a version with Buddy Miles' drums and Stephen Stills'bass, Eddie Kramer has selected a later, somewhat superior iinstrumental take, then flown in Hendrix's one and only vocal onto it. At a few points, the vocal sits somewhat awkwardly in its new setting, but this is<br />  only apparent if you've heard the vocal take in something closer to its original context. Kramer also uses an instrumental segment(from 1:58 to 2:35) from the original undoctored 1968 mix.<br /><br />3.Hear My Train A-comin'(this is a Band of Gypsies studio take, which has its moments, but it is obviously a rehearsal, and has a fairly abrupt, rather perfunctory ending. The tempo is somewhat faster, the rhythms somewhat funkier than versions by Hendrix's other bands, but certainly there are<br />  better versions of this song, notably, the live version from Woodstock, the Hendrix/Cox/ Mitchell version on the \\"Blues\\" CD, and, of course the Hendrix/Redding/Mitch version on the \\"Valleys of Neptune\\" CD....and the live Hendrix/Cox/Miles version on the \\"Live at The Fillmore East\\"<br />  2-CD set.<br /><br />4.Bleeding Heart(Hendrix experimented with various ways to arrange this blues standard, and this is yet another one, funky, but much slower tempoed than the one heard on \\"Valleys of Neptune\\". Ultimately, in a polished studio take(on the CD \\"First Rays of The New Rising\\" Sun\\") , it would nearly<br />  be turned into a Hendrix original, retaining only the lyrics from Elmore James song.)<br /><br />5. Let Me Move You(Hendrix reunites with his old \\"Chitlin' Circuit\\" friend, singer/saxophonist Lonnie Youngblood. This issue here is not whether Hendrix's playing is good[it is good, in a musical style halfway between Hendrix's past and his (then) present], but my view is that recordings featuring<br />  Hendrix as a sideman don't really fit on a Jimi Hendrix album)<br /><br />6.Izabella(a decent studio take by the Woodstock 6-piece line-up. This is a different take to the one heard on the 4-CD \\"Purple Box\\". The take heard on \\"People, Hell & Angels\\" was recorded a day before the take heard on the \\"Purple Box\\", and the arrangement is similar)<br /><br />7. Easy Blues(a fine,jazzy instrumental by the Woodstock line-up, this was first heard[in a 4:30 edit] on the Reprise Records L.P. \\"Nine to The Universe\\". The \\"People, Hell & Angels\\" CD features a 5:57 edit...still far short of the full 10 minute recording heard on bootleg CD's. The main motive for the<br />  editing seems to be to cut out passages where second guitarist Larry Lee soloed. Can't confuse the newer Hendrix fans, ya know.<br /><br />8.Crash Landing(a pro tools abomination. Eddie Kramer creates a composite of 2 or 3 vocal attempts, then flies this in over what is likely a composite of several instrumental takes. Hendrix's vocal sounds out of sync at times. It is uncomfortable to listen to. Why can't Kramer have simply given us<br />  the undoctored version of the take that alan Douglas had worked with. It is true that that take had no guitar solo, but there was another take with an inferior vocal, but WITH the guitar solo, and Kramer could have easily just flown in that solo onto the take with Hendrix's best vocals,<br />  but instead he has created this mess. Douglas' version[despite its overdubbed session guitarist, bassist, drummer,percussionist and background vocalists], remains the best version....for now.<br /><br />9.Inside Out(One of a number of instrumentals issued by Experience Hendrix, which feature riffs later used in the song \\"Ezy Ryder\\". These riffs were used in the middle section of \\"Ezy Ryder\\". An interesting look into Hendrix's creative process, and nothing more.)<br /><br />10.Hey Gypsy Boy(an early version of what would later become \\"Hey Baby{New Rising Sun]\\". This appeared in a badly doctored version on the \\"Midnight Lightning\\" album, but here it appears with the original backing musicians restored, and without Alan Douglas' overdubbed studio musicians.<br />  This undoctored take has appeared on bootleg Cd's, such as the 3-CD set \\"Mixdown Master Tapes\\", but here, in this official release, it is somewhat shortened, with some editing of the intro, but it should be noted, that even in the longer mix offered on bootleg, that the song<br />  fades up, suggesting that the original recording engineer was late in turning on the tape machine. I guess that Eddie Kramer thinks that this more abrupt start(without the fade up) is more professional sounding)<br /><br />11.Mojo Man(another track featuring Hendrix as a sideman, this time, for Albert Allen of the singing duo \\"The Ghetto Fighters\\". This is filler, and even less deserving of inclusion than the Lonnie Youngblood track. Hendrix's only involvement was to add his guitar over an existing recording that the Ghetto Fighters had recorded in Alabama. Hendrix wasn't present at the original session.)<br /><br />12.Villanova Junction Blues(a brief studio rendition of an instrumental that had been performed at the Woodstock festival. This take features Hendrix, Cox and Mitchell. It's an appropriate final track for this mixed bag of an album.<br /><br />I played this CD a lot when I first bought it, but  I don't play it much anymore. \\"Valleys of Neptune\\" was musically superior.  But you've got to give credit to Sony Music for a remarkably effective promotional campaign which put \\"People Hell & Angels\\" onto the charts. But the inclusion of two songs where Hendrix was a sideman, plus the attrociously doctored version of \\"Crash Landing\\" seriously weaken this album. Even the better songs on this CD are hardly first-rate posthumous Hendrix.<br /><br />Now Experience Hendrix can market further concert recordings to the mainstream market and bring pure, undoctored studio takes and jams to the avid fan via the mail-order \\"Dagger\\" label. That's the hope of this original Hendrix fan (I saw The Jimi Hendrix Experience play in July 1967, when I was 11 years old)
B003VXRD4E|5.0|There is a lot of excellent acting in this production of David Copperfield. Classic Micawber. Classic Heap. Classic Betsy Trotwood. Classic Mr. Dick. There isn't one sour note.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I could not read it fast enough.  A riveting read for sure, it will instantly grab you.  His history of the 60's is so good, I could put myself right there with the character.
B00BJS7104|4.0|I gave it 4 out of five because of the excessive blood. I recommend this movie to almost any one.
B007T7MIR0|1.0|The description prior to ordering was just enough to make me think this was the product I needed.  However, buyer's remorse set in quickly.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy this using this app.  The ads are a little annoying, but you can't expect anything else when it's free.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season three fulfills all expectations and more...pre-ordering Season 4 now. The series is a winner every time. Amazon will always scratch my itch for my Walking Dead cravings.
B00992CF6W|5.0|even if you are not a fan of games or minecraft you have to buy this game. totaly worth seven bucks.
0399536108|4.0|This is one of those book that I pick up, read a chapter and put down for a month and pick it up again, love the philosophies and concept...I will finish this book, just not sure when, the best part of his writing is the encouragement to think for ones self.
0143115014|5.0|Luca Turin's brilliant descriptive phrases as well as his pics AND pans is must reading for anyone who wears OR enjoys fragrance.  This would be basically anyone who has a nose. LOL...I LOVE THIS BOOK!
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|I found this an intense thriller with an exceptional cast. Excellent writing and film work. I've added this to my list of favorites.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|I love all almost all the songs on this cd.this was well worth the money and I am glad I purchase it.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|This album is exactly what I expected it to be--wonderful classic country, by the MAN, himself--VINCE GILL!  Just keep singing those classics!
B00COWOXGE|4.0|I'd imagine that most people have seen \\"The Fugitive\\" (1993) by now.  If not, you're missing out on one of the best thrillers of the 1990s, featuring great performances by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones, lots of terrific chase scenes, an interesting plot, memorable music by James Newton Howard and much more.  The film has held up nicely since 1993: it's still capable of entertaining modern audiences who have seen all the films that \\"The Fugitive\\" has influenced.<br /><br />The first Blu-ray release (with the black cover) was pretty lackluster, featuring a relatively weak A/V presentation (including lossy Dolby Digital audio) and a few recycled bonus features from the old DVD special edition.  This new 20th Anniversary Edition (white cover) has a great new transfer, a new lossless DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio track and two new bonus features: a retrospective featurette with Ford, Jones, director Andrew Davis, actors Joe Pantoliano and Jane Lynch; as well as the 2000 TV pilot of \\"The Fugitive\\"'s  revival series, which was cancelled after 22 episodes back in 2001.  This second series has not been released on DVD or Blu-ray thus far, so it's nice to have a taste of it here.  Also, the older DVD bonus features are here as well, including a few vintage featurettes and more.<br /><br />Overall, not quite a fully-loaded edition but definitely a big improvement over the first Blu-ray release.  Whether you bought that, held off or have never seen \\"The Fugitive\\", this 20th Anniversary release is worth picking up.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a great game for kids and adults. May want to fix the rarity. I will not spend my money on a game ever. So ridiculous. I have quit playing several games due to quests having you to pay out of pocket.
B005544TRQ|2.0|Predictable plot. The good guys’ always win. In real life, the good guys’ don’t always come out on top.<br />Although the suits are smart, it is not good to flaunt it and make the opponent look dumb.<br />Perhaps they could show some respect instead of being so arrogant and self-centered
B00BWJARHO|5.0|This had all the fun and excitement of the previous three films. The movie never lagged, always something going on. The scenery was as beautiful as before, the characters were great and we cared about them. I recommend this and look forward to the next.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Real close to the way an actual lawyer would operate. McConaughey is convincing in the role of the Lincoln lawyer.<br />This is my third time watching the Lincoln Lawyer and most likely it will not be the last.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|Fun little game to play when bored!<br /><br />ALSO THIS GAME DOES NOT, I REPEAT, DOES NOT REQUIRE TO CHECK OR SEARCH FOR KNOWN ACCOUNTS. CHECK THE PERMISSONS YOURSELVES IT DOES NOT ASK FOR THAT!!!!!
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|Amazing talent, I loved it! I can not wait to hear even more in the future. Thank you so much.
B000ITF86E|5.0|Just a fun movie with John Wayne at his best, , good story line for people that still have a sense of humor, and enjoy a good western  and not the idiots we are forced to watch in todays movies
B000SOYEQY|5.0|This epic is true to the era in every way. It is very long but I can't think of any scene that could be cut. Gripping story and not candy coated. The wide shots are awesome. Good character development too.
B00338QENI|4.0|Well written and provided greater insight into the world of medical research and level of oversight .  We need research but  this book also points to some researchers lack of ethics for fame.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|really disappointed in Sylvia Day with extending a three book trilogy into books 4 & 5. So when is the next installment, the 4th book coming out, and hoping we do not have to wait a year for the 5th and final book to end this series. I for one along with many other loyal readers would really like to see what transpires between Eva and Gideon. So disappointed in your decision to extend a great story line. We need closure!!!!
B005K0HDGE|3.0|This starts out with great potential but after a point it just drags along and makes the known obvious outcome boring.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Good game. Hours of fun. Highly recommend. I can't wait for part 2. Well worth price. Nice graphics too. Tally ho.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Travis Fimmel is amazing.  I love this show.  I was in the US for all the episodes but the last one.  So glad I found it on Amazon since History Channel doesn't have it's shows available for viewing on it's website.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|this game is one of my favorite always new levels to complete and coins to earn. I would recommend this for any age group. 5 star for this one.
B002U3CCF6|3.0|Not as good as &#34;Gone Girl&#34;  but an entertaining page turner - I found Gone Girl fascinating in the way it manipulated your ideas about the main characters
B009KS4XRO|4.0|The only thing wrong with this app is the time it takes to finish each game. More credits should be given.. And more puzzle pieces should be made available in the the treasure boxes.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|A different approach - but a bit too much - original but not altogether satisfying.  A different approach to WWII
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game but the minimal instruction on how to play can get frustrating. I moved through the rooms fairly quickly. rumor has there are only 10 total, so that's a little disappointing. challenging and fun overall.
B000FBJAEG|3.0|I was hoping for some insight into the plot of the first year's King and Maxwell tv series.  The plot here doesn't follow the show.  I have read most of Baldacci's books and have really liked them all (except for the Camel Club series for some reason).  I find the books to be fast paced and they move right along.  However, the conclusion of this book was just too unbelievable- that was sure some very creative villain!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I'm a big fan of iron man so this game is really cool. The graphics are good. It is very slow to advance without paying real money though. It is a &quot;runner&quot; game where you see how far you can go.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|This is one of the first books I read on atheism and it openen my eyes like nothing else I read before it. Even after my 3rd read, it still hold a lot of value.

B004KBSQOW|5.0|Loved this CD & can't stop listening to it,he was brilliant & very much loved by all who knew him
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is addictive! So much entertainment at no cost to you. Just enough of a twist from other bingo games to make is easy to move up in levels often, but not so twisted that it's hard to keep up with.
1451620829|4.0|when you get done reading this you feel like you know peter. he is overly honest in stuff that went on during the kiss years. His hate for gene because it seems he was taken advantage of due to having a love of drugs. which do ruin things!! duuuuu peter!! I dont want to give to many things away but some of the things he says any kiss fan will want to hear!! Shocking stuff that if you like the whole catalog of kiss like i do you will want to hear this.About some of the records, like I said its not fair to peter to give to much away but this is probably the best kiss book to buy because peter seems to have cleaned  up his act and the book is very interesting from beginning to end!!

B0050DZN4K|4.0|I picked Feedly when the Google Reader was discontinued. It took a bit getting used to but I now find it easier to use. It was easy to get the app on my Samsung Galaxy  phone and my Kindle 1st generation. It has more visuals than Google Reader, and I am using the reader more, almost on a daily basis.

B008WALV94|5.0|I only know that my star belinda did a work amazing in catarsis, and this cd is the best for me! ;)
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|And I was right. Felt like a cop out to me by the author, not knowing how or not wanting to do what probably should have been done. Not as bad as the conclusion of &#34;Gone Girl&#34; which was just stupid but kind of in the same vein, if more dramatic. I did not really like any of the &#34;reconciliations&#34; especially the Tess and her husband. That felt stupid. That whole storyline was not great. If ever there was a reason to get a divorce, she had it. As far as the &#34;big&#34; issue...eh. As I said, it felt like a cop-out, how to wind this thing up without anyone having to pay the legal penalty, though in AU there probably barely was one, since their laws are so gentle.
B006CUDDUG|5.0|Quintessential LeCarre.  The spy as anti hero and hero at the same time.  Direct line to Robert Wilson and A Small Death in Lisbon<br /><br />What a literary service LeCarre has done for all of us.<br /><br />BRAVO. BRAVO. BRAVO.<br /><br />Bopoho@msn
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I had to laugh at the reviews that said these teenagers weren't believable. I went to a Magnet High School and was surrounded by them. It is annoying, isn't it? Ha! Anyway, back to the book...amazing! I read it in one sitting. As a speed reader, I can do that frequently when I have nothing better to do, but on this occasion I HAD to...I needed to finish it before I could move on with my life. I really enjoyed the relationship between Isaac, Augustus, and Hazel. It reminded me a lot of my fellow wounded service members, especially the banter between them. I also enjoyed the book within a book that was such a huge part of the story. Although the ending was heartbreaking, I came away from reading this book feeling like I had witnessed a miracle.
B000006NXP|5.0|The excellence of Carlos Keliber's performance of Brahms 4th symphony is widely acknowledged.  So why is it so good?  I can think of two basic reasons:<br /><br />Metric solidity: Kleiber maintains extreme control of the meter - the overall grouping of beats - throughout.  The control provides a framework above which the symphony is constructed.  The strong sense of meter is combined with the conductor's preference for fast tempi - this thing snaps along.  The scherzo flies by and opening Allegro is among the faster I have heard.  The minus here is that this very Teutonic approach de-emphasizes the flowing and dreamy aspects of Brahms' art.  This is most apparent in the Andante, which is I think taken too quickly and presented with too little sensuous wonder.  But both of these tendencies are contained in the music.  Keliber brings out one side of it, and at its best, does it brilliantly.  When it works, it works.<br /><br />Attention to orchestration:  Kleiber's approach - a very carefully balancing of different instrumental combinations - is gratifying to someone, like me, who thinks of the 4th symphony as a marvel of orchestration.  The woodwind entrances and balances are expertly judged, with each set of timbres done a bit differently.  One particularly fine example I'll point out to is the recap of the opening Allegro's flowing theme presented in the violas doubled by the horns (mm. 297 and after, about 9 minutes into track 1), where the texture is cleared out to let the violas sing but with the horn timbre mixed in perfectly.  That's masterful conducting.<br /><br />Aside from a somewhat better sound engineering job, what can you hope for from a Brahms 4th?  Maybe the raw power of Furtwangler's 1948 recording or the flowing magic of Giulini's Chicago Symphony recording?  But Carlos Keliber's famous version is great in its own way: exciting, concise, coherent and illiuminating.

B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I really like this game..It is very additive,but if you get stuck on one, it can really use up the money that you have gained.  So, I can only say, beware of the pictures that come up and really look close at them in order to solve them, otherwise, you can be buying coins and that is very easy to do.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Bought it for my sister.  We loved it.  Ordered it for myself through Houston PBS station along with Season 4
B00CF34B2I|2.0|I give this app 2 stars because it is so large that I am unable to install it on my phone.  I really really want to be able to use this app.  Downloading it must be done over wifi because Amazon won't allow apps larger than 50MB to be downloaded via your mobile carrier.  It took forever to download and then it was very frustrating because I couldn't install it on my phone.  I have an HTC Droid Incredible 4G LTE which has 8GB of memory and I have about 85 apps that I use on my phone.  Oh well, I guess I have to wait until I get a phone with a whole lot more memory!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Hate the new version, the old  version was better.  I miss the different<br />Views you could choose from and  the nice un cluttered<br />  screen.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|This is a great movie that provides a worthy end to the Dark Knight trilogy. All movie fans, not just comic heads would enjoy the film.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I didn't like the way this was wrote, from different peoples perspectives. I found it too slow moving, and it bored me so much that I didn't come close to half way through. This is a book I never finished, for lack of interest...
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|After start of reading this book, I couldn't stop at all.<br />I wish all kids behave like Drothy and her frieds.

B009ZZDNT6|4.0|this app is very useful for when I'm traveling. I always use it for my alarm when I'm staying in a hotel. lots of alarms to choose from the only thing I would suggest as an improvement would be more clocks. there are only 3 and while all of them are nice looking I would like a bit more selection though I'm sure there are more on the paid upgrade so for a free app this is great!

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great fun when looking for a non-strategy game. I generally go more for games with puzzles but this is refreshing for focusing reflexes.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|This is a top-notch album with a much different sound than their last two offerings. (No, this isn't Nightmare, but seriously, should it be?) If you love hard rock/metal, just drop any expectations you have, sit back and take it in. With tracks like \\"This Means War\\", \\"Coming Home\\", \\"Shepherd of Fire\\" and \\"Planets\\" you'll be more than pleased.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Good action movie, was really interesting as far as character combo. Liked the after credit shwarma scene made me laugh
0385523394|2.0|It's interesting that Martha Stuart's prison experience is frequently mentioned in this book, because there are strikingly similar parallels between the stories of wealthy, upper-class New York white women doing time in a minimum security fed pen. I wanted to empathize with Kerman's make-lemonade-of-lemons perspective on her prison experience, but it felt too much like an Eat Pray Prison book report after awhile, and I've heard so many hard stories that it made Kerman's life on the inside seem much easier than a lot of women's lives on the outside. Yes, it must be sad to miss your boyfriend and family while doing time, and to not be available when your grandma dies, but that pales in comparison to the horrific lives of children and family living in ghettos for generations.<br /><br />I apologize if the above statement sounds crass; I sincerely believe prison was hard for the author, but Kerman wants us to believe in her street cred, when she mostly presents her experience as a big adventure or some sort of Americorps-style learning experience.<br /><br />I was also amazed at even an upper-class, sheltered white woman's naievety about the drug war even after having been an international drug courier and then being sent up the river for it. I realize that Kerman was being ironic in calling herself a \\"gangster\\" but it seems silly and disproportionate even at that. The point she was attempting--unconvincingly--to illustrate, was that her involvement in the drug trade made her complicit in others' addictions. This seems like just the sort of pat answer that Nancy Reagan and the discredited DARE movement would love you to believe. Shouldn't a smart New Yorker with a private-school education know better than that? Yes, yes, anyone who has even been involved with drugs can whip themselves for it later like a 14th century monk and cry, \\"drugs are bad! I have sinned!\\" but this one-dimensional, tone-deaf reprise does nothing to address the underlying causes or effects of druguse, let alone the complexities of the prison-industrial complex or the racist policies that led to the formation of drug laws in the first place. I'm willing to believe that Kerman--like so many of us when we're young--did something phenomonally reckless and stupid, but evil and responsible for other peoples' addictions? That's a little too self-indulgent and god-like for a skeptic like me to buy into.<br /><br />Kerman could have used her book as a platform to explore these issues, and the advantages afforded by her by virtue of her race, class, wealth and life of privilege. Instead, she vacillates between wallowing in guilt and celebrating her new found sisterhood with the other inmates. I imagine that many people reading the book or watching the TV show will be more interested in the latter, anyway. I was hoping for an amateur ethnographic narrative, but Kerman's string of mostly unrelated anecdotes don't delve very deeply into the lives and backgrounds of the fellow inmates doing time with her apart from fleshing out myriad examples of stereotypical female bonding experiences, judgmental observations of other inmates, and mildly pompous, self-laudatory diatribes highlighting her own compassionate and enlightened nature.<br /><br />I will give the author props for highlighting the injustice of mandatory minimum sentencing, and I think that that a book written by a white woman about prison probably is more likely to be taken seriously and turn heads. I hope that Kerman will use her new found fame to be an activist for prison reform and yes (I still have faith that she could wake up) even drug law reform, rather than merely re-telling her own story because frankly, there ain't much to tell.
B008JFUNTG|3.0|I like the first movie of this series, \\"Percy Jackson, The Lightning Thief\\",  so much that I asked my friend to watch this movie in the theatre with me. Below is what I think about it.<br /><br />- What make me like the most about the first film are the jokes. This one has less funny scenes.<br /><br />- The special effects yield mixed result. The fire bull in the beginning scene looks lively and ferocious. The \\"sea horse\\" that acts as a ferry looks beautiful and life-like. However, the giant, fiery god in the last scene is disappointing. He looks fake. Clash of The Titans (2010) has the same special effect of the same character but it looks more convincing.<br /><br />- The acting is acceptable.<br /><br />- It contains no foul languages, no sex. So, it's suitable for a family movie.<br /><br />According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this picture:<br /><br />UPDATED Sep. 24, 2013<br />Release Date: August 7, 2013<br />Production Budget: $90 million<br />Domestic:  $66,975,828<br />+ Foreign: $124,232,992<br />= Worldwide:  $191,208,820<br /><br />So, it's a big flop in North America. However, people overseas love it. Globally, It took in 101 millions more than its production cost. That's a huge amount of money. I'm sure we'll see the next sequel by the end of 2016.<br /><br />In short, it's worth watching once. It deserves 3 stars.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game. It was fun and can't wait for more rooms to become available. So have a good time playing.
B0017TFLBQ|3.0|I bought this for my tablet as it is a touch friendly game.  I had a lot of troubles at first as the game (Heroes III) requires the DVD to be present which is difficult considering tablets don't have one.  Tried emulating but had problems with Windows 8 until I found a HD mod that lets it run in full colors so it can be in a windowed mode.  Great since then.  Heroes IV seems to work fine but I haven't played it really.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Addicting! Can't stop playing it. Better than most bubble shooters I've played. Great graphics and I like the concept of shooting a bow and arrow.

B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I thought it was very interesting if one is trying to find out what life was like for early Christians both right before and right after the life of Jesus.
B003Q6CUAI|3.0|Tried reading this and didn't quite get through  it all so never tried the diet. Too many diets don't cut to the knowledge needed and lose you along the way- we all want quick and easy !!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun. Its just like having a real horse and i love it.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Can you see some of the jokes coming a mile away? Yes.<br />But overall, is it well-written and upbeat? Yes.<br />This is not a movie of great depth that will leave you changed forever. It's a light, fun film, offering different perspectives in an engaging way as you wonder how their paths will all cross.<br /><br />A hidden gem, funny.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Really good game, great puzzles and not too difficult. A fun way to kill some time and keep your brain ticking.
B00004YA66|5.0|Awesome old movie. Still love it as much today as I did when it first came out in the theatre.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|the imagery is incredible, as is the cinematography.  Some scenes are simply breathtaking.<br />what he refers to as \\"God\\" is quite wonderfully, yet simply, nature; it all its glory, mystery and terrible consequences.  Nature can care for us and it can be dangerous if we don't respect it.  The tiger leaving without a goodbye, nature. the island that nourished and sustained him? nature, mother earth.<br />but the story was so-so; about a young, fairly foolish boy.  To me it the real story was about the awesome power of Nature.<br />I was not enlightened by the boy's story, not did it carry any depth.<br />but, to each his own.
B004132I20|5.0|Sherlock gives a fantastic contemporary approach to an iconic favorite.  An added benefit is the fact that, while alluding to the original stories, these episodes are a new experience even for those familiar with Doyle's work.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|First I would like to say RIP Chris Kyle and thank you for your service to this country. I wish I could say that I enjoyed reading the book, but I didn't. Perhaps it was the style it was written in or the manner in which the stories were told, but I never had that &#34;Wow, I need to tell someone else to read this&#34; feeling.
1849904251|5.0|The story behind the television series is an &#34;easy read&#34; and very entertaining.  If you have watched Sherlock, you will definitely enjoy this companion book.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|The film series is amazing. These movies are an annual watch and I enjoy them every year. The plots and characters are interesting and the special effects are outstanding.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Don't listen to those 1-2 star reviews. They don't know what there talking about.<br />It works on kindle fire. For those of you who are giving 4-5 star reviews<br />you are fine. But if you give 1-2 star reviews then your wrong (and I'm sorry for those of you who give 1-2 star reviews, but I'm being honest about my review<br />,and if you are against my review,that's your problem.) So download this app now<br />.get it while it's cheap!!!!!!! (And, no it dose not cause viruses) I HATE 1 STAR RATINGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1400095204|4.0|This is the second novel by Adichie I have read.  I started with Americanah and after reading thought that I'd like to read one of her earlier pieces.  However, I was worried that, like many authors, the depth and sophistication of their early writing did not compare to their later novels.  That is not the case with Adichie.  Her characters are so well developed and thought out that I can't help but think that she actually knew these people.<br />Her writing is beautiful and accurate.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this app it's like a teinsie bit like temple run but you can<br />Have a machine gun jet pack and more. You can change your skin. Kill<br />Nerds and special abilities like a giant robot,(aka l'il stomper) but I<br /> Will save the rest 4 u guys.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|I know you want to. I want to. BUT DON'T DO IT!<br />Don't buy this blu-ray. Paramount marketing thought it would be a good idea to make retailers feel special (not amazon though) and split up all the special features, created by the filmmakers, for the fans. So no commentary (even though it exists). And only a small portion of special features.<br /><br />What does this mean? If you want all the special features created for this release, you have to buy 3 different versions of the blu-ray plus the itunes version (for the director's commentary).<br /><br />This is not a good practice to support. Don't let these idiots take advantage of you. While it sucks to not be able to own this sci-fi gem, look at the release calendar for paramount following this. Expect similar practices for World War Z.<br /><br />The best way to show these jerks they're wrong is to not buy this movie.<br /><br />Live long and prosper
1434427986|3.0|Another horror story about war following people who lived through the blast.  Ignoring the atom bomb it could have been about the fire bombing of Tokyo or London and the V2 rockets.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Really enjoyed this story. It was a quirky, funny book that kept me reading far too late and much too early in the mornings. Would highly recommend this book to anyone wanting a fun and enjoyable story.

B00EOO55GW|5.0|this is one of their better albums comparable to kill switch engage i think  they nailed it with the song acid rain.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|This book is quite short for a novel but is an amazing story. It never really gets boring or slow.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I did not start watching Downton Abbey until the third season.  Watching Seasons 1 and 2 gave me a much better understanding of the series.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I hate to read but I couldn't put down this book. It was absolutely incredible. It makes you proud to be an American.
0385523912|5.0|This book was just what I needed after reading The Orphan Master's Son. This was passionate about the plight of the North Koreans but not gory or sensationalist. A good, measured explanation of the lives and escapes of some of the world's most oppressed people..

B0086700CM|5.0|My 3 yr old loves it! This game keeps his attention! I like it because it is not to voilent!
B008EKON56|3.0|Using it with my 30gb older IPod. Forget what gen it is. 5 I think? I bought this because my headphone jack is stripped on the inside so my jack doesn't make a full connection. I use the ipod only in my car, because the battery doesn't hold a charge long enough to use in any other situation. She's old... but it has a great collection! Anyway... the product itself does the trick. I went with this instead of the other $20 model. While it works, it doesn't seem to want to stay attached firmly into the charging port. One side grips better than the other, which concerns me because I feel that it could potentially damage the connections in the port. Then I'd have a totally useless ipod. And that would be sad. So consider your situation before you decide to go the cheap route. I might just spend the $20 in the long run if I feel that this product is doing me more harm than good.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Very interesting.  Never knew the first world war was such a political mess.  Who knew?  I loved the characters.  And, of course the writing of Ken Follett is wonderful.
B00A83075M|5.0|My granddaughter is totally enthralled with this movie. It was for her third birthday and has been watched numerous times. Good for all ages. Go Disney!
B007MJT1K2|5.0|Very good family movie where the animation is excellent, the story line is engaging and suspenseful. Plenty of action and is well worth watching!

0765348276|3.0|This book was sort of dry and laid back in the beginning and I was wondering if was going to get anywhere.  Although it was written well enough that kept me interested long enough to see if the book would pick up the pace.  Finally John Perry and friends get aboard the transport spaceship  (that was made out to be more like a luxury liner ),  while enjoying the fruits of life as they were off to another world. It's an old man's dream actually that most everyone could relate with as you get older.<br /><br />Boot camp was getting even more interesting as they experience their youth again in a cloned alien body that has great potential.  Beside their new enhanced alien body , they also get one other weapon that apparently is all they'll  need  throughout the rest of the book.  Although  John Perry was a likeable enough person right from the start ,  as all the new and interesting people he came across all liked him during his journey.  I also like his character which kept me reading on and see what will happen  next.<br /><br />There was only one decent alien battle  that was described well , and John Perry took most of the credit for winning the battle with his ingenuity in defeating the aliens on their own turf.  Although , his idea was simple enough that most everyone should have caught on before he came up the plan that saved the day.<br /><br />In the next chapter I was getting a little excited to see if there was going to be a nice space battle going on with battleships slugging it out over Planet Coral. As It turns out ,  there were only a few missile hits and off goes John to the planet surface  , later to be rescued by his ex-wife who is now only six years old.  It goes downhill from there with the quick space battle being an afterthought  , and moving on into a weird sense of remembering his past again with a six year old who he gets to know very well during the course of the next few chapters . She confronts him in many ways  , speaking of his previous wife's past and the thought of him being inside her ,  as if she was talking about herself as well when she was speaking to him close up  , almost toughing his lips.  Okay really?  A six year old resembling your ex-wife?  Sounds more like sick fantasy rather than science fiction.<br /><br />The ending wasn't solid but we did get to hear what John Perry did for his friends  ,  and how happy they were now working R&D on the new alien space tech.  But again in a nut shell ,  you would think that there are much more qualified people out there to get the job done right , like his gay friend Alan who surely cant be a one of a kind.<br /><br />I actually would have not given this review a good score if it weren't for John Perry himself  , who is a likeable character with good morals  , who  has saved the day on more than one occasion. Although it's more like fiction with a flair for sexual fantasy written by John Scalzi who I'm not sure about.  What was Scalzi thinking of when he came up with some of these more unusual pleasure seeking ideas. The way he drops a hint  , and then walks away from it. It's not just for extra credit..  I'm wondering if he's all there and I also wonder if he really is surrounded  with a loving family and as many helpful friends in the acknowledgements.'s past and the thought of him being inside her ,  as if she was talking about herself as well when she was speaking to him close up  , almost toughing his lips.

B004SIP9VA|5.0|If you don't like musicals, you won't like it.  Might not be like some of Richard Gere's movies but I still thought he did a great job in this one.  I read what all they went through just to learn the dance steps and it was sheer dedication by  all of them.  The pain and hours and hours of practicing before being filmed.<br /><br />I never get tired of this one.

B0033H7VI6|3.0|It is a solid, stout knife. The only real concern I had was the cutting edge(or lack thereof). The blade is awkward to sharpen on a regular stone(I mostly used a file.)and the edge did not stay sharp for very long. The sheath is one redeeming quality. I like the removable pouch on the front, which can be used separately on almost anything with MOLLE webbing. My overall impression is that I bought this knife too hastily and if I had it to do over again, I would choose a different model.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|...for ten minutes to try this game. it keeps downloading and installing and never seems to get around to actual game. bored already
B000002MTU|5.0|The critics of this album who complain that this is a perfect copy of the blues and not the real thing have a point . . . but a perfect copy is pretty much the real thing, isn't it?  And no one can doubt Clapton's serious interest in this music: the Robert Johnson tribute album was dull, but it says something about Clapton that he wanted to make it.  His own blues writing isn't all that compelling . . . but he keeps trying.  His collaborations with real bluesmen like BB King are fine.  On this disc of blues standards, he has a great, tight backup band, and the sound quality is superb.  His guitar work is very very good -- but all the musicians here are very good.  And he gives himself to the songs with feeling and energy --  \\"I'm Tore Down\\" is one I didn't know, and it's soulfully done here.  \\"Hootchie Cootchie Man\\" catches the element of comic self-dramatization perfectly.  \\"A Sinner's Prayer\\" goes well, and my favorite is probably \\"It hurts me too,\\" a direct blues version of the sentiments of \\"Bridge over Troubled Water.\\"  Throughout the album, Clapton sings very well -- he has the stylistic tricks down pat, and if he can't make them sound totally organic, well, there's more than enough to compensate.  Part of the problem is that vocally he doesn't have a blues style of his own -- what white guy does? Van Morrison, for one.  But this is honest, heartfelt music making, and the material he's working with is powerful.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Love the end.  So glad they can be together.  Looking forward to the next book.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|America's love affair with extroverts began in the early part of the 20th century, when people like Dale Carnegie impressed upon our parents the importance of winning friends and influencing people in order to be successful.<br /><br />But our cultural preference for extroversion was not always a part of our national psyche.  In the 19th century, America judged leadership potential the same way many countries do today - on the basis of integrity, judgment, reliability and intelligence.<br /><br />The emerging growth cultures of Asia are not the only places in the world today puzzled by the America's continuing obsession with popularity and by our insistence upon turning over most of our elective offices, executive management positions and financial control to people who would rather talk than listen, who make quick decisions based on gut instinct and who prefer risk to contemplation.<br /><br />Susan Cain's defense of introverts, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking weaves together research and personal anecdotes to make a case for taking a second look at the value brought to relationships and organizations by our quieter, more sensitive citizens.<br /><br />She challenges the corporate focus on team building, open space offices and endless meetings, recounting histories of influential leaders who had a preference to work alone and in quiet.  She is surprised that scarcely an introvert is to be found on the hallowed grounds of Harvard Business School and wonders whether Enron or the economic collapse of the housing market would have happened if the investment banks had put in positions of responsibility fewer talkers and more thinkers.<br /><br /> Ms. Cain's chapter on raising sensitive children provides useful guidance to parents of children who don't easily adjust to the forced extroversion of years of schooling in an environment better suited to outgoing personalities.<br /><br />I'm not generally a fan of self-help books or psychological non-fiction.  I listened to the audio version of this book while running errands.  But Susan Cain is insightful and perceptive, and this book is worth reading.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0988376806 One Summer in Arkansas]]
B000002KDW|3.0|So much talent in this band. It seems they were wondering would they would be when then grew up. Once they figured it out, they parted ways. Some may call this album an eclectic mix. I find it a tiring, uneven venture that occasionally gets it right, but mostly misses what they seemed to be aiming for. Still, if one listens to the individual performances on the album - Lane's bass, Wood's guitar, Stewart's vocals..., the parts were there. They just didn't add up.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This is a novel of savage surprise. There are no clear heroes or villains here, just a slowly evolving pallet of darkness and light within every character, every country, every species. Everyone is culpable, but everyone, from the best to the seeming worst, is capable of wonder. This novel is a painful joy to inhabit.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the special horses I get it their special but ill never be able to earn up the money(gems) to buy them and I cant spend real money.Also sometimes the game refuses to load but it does load most of the time but again sometimes it wont let me check my friends or meet new Ppl because it wont connect.good game all in all love the graphics so 5 stars instead of 4 cause it could just be my kindle messing up

B00ECUARO8|1.0|Picture quality very poor it starts out at 3 then drops to 2 then1 it actually hurts my eyes to watch the movie.<br /><br />Finally got the video quality back to 3, the movie was great, I would give it about a 4 star.

B005L38QHA|5.0|Ok, unlike the others reviewing here, I thought this mouse was amazing. It has 11 buttons, and they are very well placed unlike the ones on the Nagas. In fact, the design is the BEST. The only competition is the other WoW mice. It works great in all games and even when using 3D programs like Maya. The DPI settings were perfect for me(Gamer/3D artist.) The issue I had, and what spurred me to write this review, is that the laser has basically died after 10 days short of a year. That was an expensive $60 for something that died in a year.<br /><br />I am waiting for them to get back to me. If support is helpful I will come back and update this. I have just never had to deal with SteelSeries support in the past so hopefully it isnt painful.<br /><br />EDIT: So far, support has been fantastic. They promptly replied to me, on Labor day at 8AM(which I didn't think was possible) and the RMA is all set and just waiting on the forever slow USPS to get it back to the warehouse.<br /><br />I really do not understand all of the bad reviews. Great mouse, great design, great support, affiliated with Blizzard, and glows with any color you want. If it does die, just send it back.

B00BMTX5XM|5.0|The great 4AD records have stumbled upon yet another winning act building on traditions from Dead Can Dance through to Blonde Redhead (the latter being the most underrated act in the planet). Is there a genius in the company chair there? The album seems like one long hypnotic 45 minute number about love & love lost & so little point to describe each track but I'd like to try :o). Opens with 'Winter' which sets the weather for both beauty & desolation. Then 'Smother' and hey they were brave enough to release this as a 7\\" single. Sounding like XX (or is it XX sounding like Daughter) as Elena Tonra pours her heart out \\"I want him but we are not right\\" deep brilliant lyrics & quite spellbinding \\"all my children can become me\\" \\"what a mess I leave to follow\\" and builds into a climax ;o) 'Youth' could be the best here \\"'cause most of us are heaving through corrupted lungs\\" \\"the lovers that went wrong\\" with emotion in overload \\"and you caused it\\" plus great the way the drums burst into life with powerful beat flourishes. 'Still' is another dramatic ethereal piece...this is not dance music but music that needs to be listened to. 'Lifeforms' spurred on by the guitar arpeggios & haunting vocals is another emotional tour de force \\"or find the children lost at sea\\" \\"you'll always find another womb to grow\\". Sublime. 'Tomorrow' more desolation via some heavier guitar \\"don't bring tomorrow because I already know I'll lose you\\". 'Human' is the most upbeat, energetic & danceable and adds a nice change. 'Touch' with each listen new shades appear - amazing & grabs you & pulls you in \\"can feel something\\". 'Amsterdam' is totally mesmerizing. Finally track 'Shallows' is where the title comes from \\"if you leave, when I go, you'll find me in the shallows\\" as it slowly builds into a climax with the drums ricocheting, reverb guitars & vocals all seemingly at different rhythms, but it all falls together perfectly & is more emotional overload. Elena's voice really seems as if she's living theagony (understated, honest, humble & pure). The slight fault is that it is not a particularly fun & uplifting ride but nevertheless somehow meshes into a beautiful soundscape which you can place onto repeat as each listen reveals more magic. Yes this album is sublime & the album of 2013.

Pam has a great sense of humor and knows how to keep things lively and interesting. I know some wish it were longer, but for me, it was the right length. Too much information makes things complicated and bogs you down. I highly recommend it to people interested in Law of Attraction.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This book has all the interesting hooks for a young reader - misunderstood by his parents, losing a beloved relative, time travel, magic, and horror all wrapped up neatly in a great read!
B003TQKVGU|5.0|I found this book enlightening and inspirational, it is one of the best books I have read. I would encourage everyone to read it.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|An excellent book for anyone who appreciates a good mystery. You will not guess &#34;who done it&#34;.<br />Try it you won't regret it.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|after you wait 15 minutes for it to load every time, and cross your fingers that it doesn't freeze immediately once it is going, its pretty fun! good job kinda....
B000RO9VJK|5.0|Astonishing read! Invigorating. So easy to understand the concept and it truly applies to everyone.  I'm ready to call myself to action. Thank you!
B0030MTQNW|5.0|Great cast, beautifully directed by Richard Attenborough.  Very realistic war scenes created before the age of digital overkill, as well as capturing the pain and suffering of everyone caught up in the throes, soldier and civilian alike.  If only \\"never again\\" would become true.  Europe seems to have temporarily learned a lesson in that regard.

B007ZD17XO|4.0|I spend most of my time trying to beat the high score. It's addicting trying to see what combinations I can get and how high I can get the score.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|So in love with these characters!!!!  A superbly written work of historical fiction .  I felt like I was transported back in time.  Such an enjoyable and educational tale.
140006922X|5.0|This is an excellent book and the author is an obvious expert in religious history.  While Christians may not agree with the ultimate position of the book, it is still a great read loaded with lots of quotes along with citations to the Old and New Testaments.
0440243688|5.0|Gone Tomorrow by Lee Child<br /><br />Reacher faces terrorists extorting a clerk from the Pentagon.  As usual, when Reacher's sense of justice is violated, mayhem ensues.<br /><br />Child does a nice job bringing a historic perspective to the Afghan fiasco.  At least Child has learned the value of history and the clarity of perspective it provides if one only studies it.<br /><br />Reacher is the classic, doesn't play well with others, protagonist.  His frustration with the inability of the \\"machine\\" to protect the vulnerable, leads him to his own brand of vigilante justice.  The scenario's primary location are the mean streets of New York.  The tenor of the tale, once again, casts aspirations on the quality of personnel in the federal sector.  Reacher has more faith in the NYPD than he does in the alphabet soup of D.C.<br /><br />As in all the Jack Reacher books I have read so far, there is non-stop action and lots of violence.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book and I recommend the book.
B004VLZUI6|5.0|My Mom wanted to see this before she went in for open heart surgery. Went everywhere near where we live and no one had it. Amazon got the movie to us in time and Mom was trilled. So was I.

B000FC0SIM|5.0|I must confess that I've never read a novel by Steven King, nor have I ever seen a movie based on one of his works. Horror is just not my preferred genre.<br />I did, however, find On Writing a helpful and engaging read, abounding in humor and sound advice. For example: \\"Pace is the speed at which your narrative unfolds. There is a kind of unspoken (hence undefended and unexamined) belief in publishing circles that the most commercially successful stories and novels are fast paced. . .Like so many unexamined belief in the publishing business this idea is largely (expletive deleted)  . . .which is why, when books like Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose or Charles Frazier's Cold Mountain suddenly break out of the pack and climb the best-seller lists, publishers and editors are astonished. I suspect that most of them ascribe these books' unexpected success to unpredictable and deplorable lapses into good taste on the part of the reading public.\\"<br />On his first agent: \\"He was well into his eighties, unwell, and died shortly after our first correspondence. I can only hope it wasn't my initial batch of stories that killed him.\\"<br />To Steven King \\"Writing isn't about making money, getting famous, getting dates, (censored), or making friends. In the end it's about enriching the lives of those who will read your work, and enriching your own life.\\" Here I couldn't agree more.<br />One of the keys to being a writer, according to King, is to be a reader, a voracious reader. Don't just read good literature, read the mediocre and the bad as well-these latter inform you of what not to do.<br />An aspiring writer might want to read this book several times, because there are a lot of useful concepts to be absorbed. (Including \\"refrain from the passive voice\\"-oops!) I'm still not a fan of Steven King's genre but I've decided to put The Dead Zone on my \\"to read\\" list.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Came across this when looking for a new book. This is not my usual read but the reviews were good enough for me to buy book one. No regrets at all.  I can honestly say that every page was  read and each page a delight. Now downloading book two.

B003G4W49C|5.0|It was fantastic to find a book that was so well written. It makes you feel like every page you turn makes you more a part of something really special. If you're hesitant to read this, just do it. You will not be disappointed.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Most of the album is pretty good.  Some of the songs have good music but horrible lyrics.  But if you're looking for the traditional Madonna music such as that heard on some of her earlier albums then steer clear of this album because it's much different.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Right when I got the game it did not open  it usually opens on phone but never on the kindle
B007PVHMCG|1.0|I bought this toy for 48.99 from amazon and after a week i see it selling for 34.97. Be careful and deliberate before you blindly buy stuff from Amazon. I am thinking of closing my prime account with them as well.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|The story is captivating. Never losing my attention. So much about their relationship brought back memories of one I had in my twenties with a sexy beautiful young guy. He did all the same things, this story woke my sleeping goddess.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game for those times you have a few spare minutes.  Easy to get hooked on. Love Gru and the minions!
B0002IVN9W|4.0|Classic albums for me capture the moment that they were recorded and also remain strangely timeless and often improve with age, this album ticks all those boxes.  I find something new everytime I listen to it and it often moves me to tears.  If you think great music ended in the 20th century, think again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing! I felt the emotions of the characters and was kept guessing and guessing. Im incredibly satisfied with this book and recommend it to everyone.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Simple. Quick. Good Quality. The best way to watch Netflix.<br />I am listening to BB King right now from my computer to sound system.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|I love the series. However, the episode 8 was the same as the final episode. I really wish I could see the finally episode of season 2!<br />I would rate it 5 stars if I actually received all the episodes I fully paid for.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|When you consider the conflicts among the ever-fluctuating membership of Eagles, I would have expected this history to be a blame game - catty and self-aggrandizing. Not so - at least not totally so. The current Eagles membership are mature males now, and they're able to reflect on their glories, their mistakes, their conflicts with reasonable minds.<br /><br />The package comes with 3 DVDs: the first years and coming together of the Eagles until their breakup. The second deals with the current lineups since the reforming after a 14 year layoff. The third and the only disappointment for me was a 1979 concert in Washington D.C. The sound is murky, the video grainy, and the concert itself all too short. But them I'm judging this DVD by modern standards, and that's unfair.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Great story lines, sets, characters and acting! Easily my favorite HBO series. I just wish I could watch season 3.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Thought provoking as this book appears to be well researched... Caused me to reevaluate my youth based belief and affirmed my current thoughts about my Christianity.

B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|This was a great Star Trek movie - exciting action, familiar villains, true to the old while still bringing a lot new to the table.
0345529057|5.0|Really great books and fun to read. Watched the show which turned me onto it and the subtle differences are fun to spot, but that's not the whole appeal. If you're a fan of the show like I am, it's interesting getting to see the character's inner dialogue in situations you're already familiar with. The actors could only offer a hint of it through facial expression (which they do very well) but getting inside their head opens up so many of the characters on a much deeper level. Highly recommend.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie is awesome! This movie is actually totally freaking awesome! They pulled it off. I never thought they would. I never thought they could. This movie is an absolute mind blowing experience. This movie is one for the books. It is a must see adventure. I really do love it when a plan comes together!

030758836X|5.0|I chose this book based on the Best Seller List for my monthly book club.  I wanted a book I couldn't put down and this was it.  We couldn't wait for the book club meeting so we could discuss it and it was one of our most-attended meetings ever.  Everyone wanted to talk about it.  It is a complete guilty pleasure read with no redeeming value but if you want something to read by the pool or on a plane, etc. or want something to discuss in a group, I highly recommend it.
B00947N6UG|5.0|This may not have been a huge success at the box office but our family really enjoyed this film. These combo packs are such a great deal. I love getting the digital copy.
0385344228|4.0|I loved this book and our book club discussion on it was one of our best ever.  We discussed Jacob's story from his perspective, the father's and the mother's and it made for a very interesting discussion.  Wasn't crazy about the ending which kept it from 5 stars.
B004GJDQT8|2.0|I know its not the apps fault, but I got this app for the videos , and to download other events and merchandise as a prime member I can not access any of the movies,or the things I wanted to download...I like the app looks good on my phone , but that about it..

B00007AJGH|5.0|Fun for everyone.  The unexpected twist is good. A great mix of the genres.  Poor Betty, but it is hard to compete with Jessica, she is truly in a league of her own.
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|I've been listening to AiC since I was 10, when their second album came out. They've been my favorite band for a very long time, and I was pretty sure they'd never come back when Layne passed. But they did, and I'm pleased with the result.<br /><br />First off, no - to purists, it won't be the *same*. Obviously it can't be, since Layne is gone. But they're still producing a sound that is distinctive to AiC. The music ranges from almost languid to sinister, from angry to broken, haunting to almost damnedly hopeful. They've always been good at creating an ambience with the underlying tones and somehow manage to make several sounds that would be off-key on their own into something that fits together into a beautifully discordant melody that *works*. They dip down and back up with all the emotional roller-coaster anguish, fury, disgust and loss they've always had the knack for.<br /><br />Secondly, keep in mind that they have aged, and all bands tend to mellow as they age. Few manage to hold the extreme energy that they had when they first start. AiC has managed to hold the tone, if not the energy itself, turning the \\"mellowing\\" into an evolutionary darkening instead. AiC has always been difficult for most to classify - grunge, yes, but not in the same way that, say, STP was. They seem to ride the line between (and occasionally stray from it into) both grunge and metal. The sound may be a little different than say, Dirt or Facelift. But even so, they are still very distinctly hard in the right places, subtle and drawling in the perfect spots, and deliberately muddied and tangled in precisely the spots you'd find they fit.<br /><br />In short, I loved the album. It shows the direction the band is going in, moving on from Layne's death but still holding true to the elements that make AiC what it is, and distinguishing itself from a world filled with otherwise samey-sounding BS. I would *rather* they evolve and explore their creativity than have them stuck in a rut tryingto recreate a past they cannot reclaim with a key element missing. They're making the best of the situation, and I, for one, am pleased immensely with the whole of it.<br /><br />Give it a try, I think you'll find that if you take it for what it is, and don't try to constantly compare it to whet they produced a.) decades ago b.) when they were much younger and full of piss and vinegar c.) and with Layne alive, you'll come to appreciate it for what it is for its own merits.
B00DHHWXYY|4.0|This is definitely a very colorful, flashy version like all Baz movies. I didn't think it was better or worse than the Robert Redford/Mia Farrow version, just different. No offense to Jay Z, but I would have preferred more 1920's-esq music in the background than all modern stuff.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I started reading this book because I saw the movie preview and thought it looked good. Before seeing the movie though,I read and finished this quickly. The book always kept me interested and the ending had me ready to start the second book, which is what I'm going to do now.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Not a favorite of mine, but wanted to try it since I hear so much about it.  Probably great for younger kids.
B00DU77QP2|5.0|This book is often refered to as a &#34;twilight wannabe&#34;. I must inform you that this is so far from the truth its on another freakin planet. This book is so original! I was so invested in this book, i cried happy tears, sad tears and teard of gut wrentching hilarity tears. This book was unique, i loved clary, sure she was immature and ridiculous at times, but thats what made her charcter honest! Now the movie wasnt nearly as good as the book, but when is it ever? However it was still enjoyable. Overall this was a fantastic book, congratulations readers on finding a fantastic read.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Memoirs often depict adversity and extraordinary challenges that the author has endured throughout his/her life. Memoirs are not intended to entertain; they are written to offer us insight and enable us to connect with emotions we may or may not have experienced; to remind us of our humanity and of our obligation to have compassion for those less privileged or fortunate than we are.<br />Writing a book is difficult enough, but writing a memoir is much more demanding for it requires a great deal of courage to revisit one's suffering, and to remain true to the essence of the story without the freedom to sugarcoat it to please a particular readership.  A reader, who is not interested in a true story, should look elsewhere.  There are always more than adequate reviews to let the reader know what to expect in a book.  Why then choose to read a memoir and be disappointed because it was sad and depressing?  Why give an author a one-star review because she/he told the truth and did not fabricate a life story that would make the readers `happy'? Worse yet, why give the author a poor review because Amazon did not deliver the product on time or because your Kindle failed you? This is utterly preposterous!<br />In my view, McCourt has delivered his story honestly and skillfully. I learned about aspects of a culture that I was entirely unfamiliar with. The story captivated me, made me sad, and stirred in me a myriad of emotions that I recognized in myself and in all humanity . . .. It was everything that I expected from a memoir and McCourt delivered it beautifully.

B00BI5J9BC|4.0|For those who loved the play and have listened to the sound track millions of times, Colm Wilkinson as Val Jean and Terrance Mann as Javert will tell you that there are irreplaceable.  Having Colm show up as he priest was completely unexpected and had me literally cheering!<br /><br />Having said that, did I enjoy this?  Yes.  The music is so moving that even less than &#34;Colm&#34; level singers brought the emotion.  However, I felt like the real broadway level singing started with the barricade.<br /><br />Javerts big numbers, Stars and his suicide were a bit flat.<br /><br />Loved it when Javert pinned his medal on Gavroche, had me in tears, didn't remember that from the musical.<br /><br />Rent the 25th anniversary edition and feel the music in a way this did not bring it to life.
1603429999|5.0|It has an index! Love this feature of this book.<br />Pictures are clear and big enough to see what the heck you are supposed to be learning.<br />Very happy with this author.
1400069289|2.0|I saw the author interviewed on TV and thought, 'wow, this sounds like an interesting topic -- how habits basically govern your life and if you change a habit, it becomes a domino effect that ripples through other aspects of your life'.  The book started off strong with references to neurological studies, but quickly became a string of anecdotes which the author has tortured into his definition of a habit.  For example, that Alcoa Steel's history of industrial accidents are the result of a corporation's habits really stretches credulity.  That workers, using very dangerous machinery, override safety protocols or just plain screw up are examples of corporate habit is just silly.  Also, the experiments using cues and rewards smacked of Pavlovian conditioning -- not exactly the cutting edge insight into habits I hoped for.  All in all, the book had an interesting few pages on how Target targets its customers individually by amassing and integrating huge databases of personal information, but that example really had nothing to do with 'habits', per se.
B0094LU9C0|5.0|I love this movie and I just had to buy it to watch it with my daughter. She loved it and I appreciated the HD clarity and wonderful colors.
B002BFBAWO|3.0|I watched this movie on the Fourth Of July.  I guess I thought it would be more of a \\"summer\\" type movie.  It was, in a way, so on the closing weekend of summer, for lack of anything better to do, I thought I'd write a review.<br /><br />This movie is a period piece. It's one of those movies that feel like it was made as a period piece mainly because, if the characters had cellphones, a lot of their problems would have been solved right away.<br /><br />It's set in 1987, which appears to be one of the most fertile times for 2000s period pieces (Donnie Darko, House Of The Devil, etc.). I think it was in 1987, anyway.  If so, it's some sort of parallel dimension 1987 where the average chick who goes to amusement parks a) is really impressed by the fact that a guy played guitar with Lou Reed, and b) knows who Lou Reed is.  Sort of like Donnie Darko's parallel dimension, where everybody listens to Tears For Fears, Echo & The Bunnymen and The Church, but nobody is blasting Dokken or Huey Lewis.  But then, that WAS in a parallel dimension, so I guess I can't really criticize it for that.<br /><br />The characters smoke a lot of pot.  Only a few people smoke cigarettes.  So again, parallel dimension 1987.  They work at an amusement park and screw around all summer.  The main guy likes the main girl, and she seems to like him, and that's pretty much all you need to know.  The rest of the movie just sort of drifts along.<br /><br />It drifts along, and it's sort of nice, because it means you don't really have to pay much attention to what is going on most of the time.  Not much really does, after all.  If French New Wave cinema can get away with that, why not a movie with the rather deceptive title \\"Adventureland\\"?<br /><br />Jesse Eisenberg is neurotic and annoying.  The girl from Twilight is nice to look at, even if she is somehow desiccated-looking.  Bill Hader spends the entire movie acting really boring and lame, all for a payoff in one scene that seems really predictable once you see it.  The guy who played Bill on \\"Freaks And Geeks\\" plays \\"A Somewhat Older Version Of Bill With Longer Hair And A Pipe\\" (that's quite an acting range).  Some guy who I guess is famous plays a guy who may or may not have played guitar with Lou Reed.<br /><br />Some people have compared this movie to Superbad because it was made by the same guy.  They point out that it eschews the \\"grossout\\" humor of Superbad.  This is true.  It also eschews all other types of humor (except a guy who enjoys punching people in the beanbag) and most types of drama.  Like I said.  It just sort of drifts along.<br /><br />Which could be a complaint, if you were expecting something to happen.  I wasn't, really.  And, if you remember back to summers like this one, when you were around this age, they really DID kind of just drift along.  The main characters spend the entire movie waiting for something to happen.  They really WERE kind of just killing time until the summer ended, and this movie is about that.<br /><br />Usually, in these kinds of movies, the suspense comes from the obstacles placed between the star-crossed lovers, and how they overcome them.  In this movie, they're overcome by the guy just deciding to overcome them.  That's about it.<br /><br />There is a subplot about anti-Semitism that seemed a little corny and tacked-on so that the movie had SOME relevance to something.  All I could think of when they were talking about it, though, was the fact that a Jewish director spent a couple million dollars making a movie where all of the sympathetic characters were Jewish, and all the non-Jewish characters seemed to have pretty significant brain damage, so it's not like he's...<br /><br />But, you know what, it doesn't matter.  Nothing about this movie matters.<br /><br />It just is.  This may sound like a complaint, but it's not.  Yes, it's boring, and nothing happens.  But nothing REALLY happens in Withnail & I either, and that's one of my favorite movies (and, weirdly enough, I just realized that that movie was a period piece about the sixties, made IN 1987, of all years.  Synchronicity?).<br /><br />The thing is, Withnail & I had interesting characters, that were so vividly realized they practically leapt off the screen.  This movie doesn't, but then, most people aren't really like that.  Call it cinema verite.<br /><br />Like I said.  Everyone has had a summer like this.  Where you just sort of kill time, waiting for something to happen.  This movie is about that summer.  It's kind of like this review.  It's not about anything, and spends a lot of time going off on pointless tangents.  But not every summer can be life-changing, like the one in The Sandlot.  Sometimes, someone is going to decide to make a movie about the pointless, boring summer everyone has.  If you're going to do that, how else do you do it?

B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I like the creativity in his plots and the way he makes them plausible..<br />The end became a little didactic and was boring.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|My son tried to download it and turns out we would have to get rid of most our other apps to play it on the kindle fire.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|I loved this app when I first got it.  I had no problems with it.  I don't use it all the time but when I need it I expect it to work.  I'm at my daughter's this weekend and tried to set it last night.  It froze repeatedly; so much so that I uninstalled it and reinstalled it to try to get it to work. I was finally able to get it set for this morning but when I woke up on my own, 30 minutes after it was supposed to go off, it had frozen yet again.  Very frustrating!  I tried to set it again to go off in the next 30 minutes and after finally getting that done, I noticed that the seconds were counting in 4 - 5 second intervals.  By this time I finally gave up.  I gave it 2 stars only because it did work great in the beginning.  Hopefully, the developer can get whatever the problem is resolved and if so, I will gladly give a try again.  I have not permanently deleted it from my Kindle Fire - yet.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|This book was not what I had expected, but ended up enjoying the slightly different slant he gave to life.
B0013ND30M|1.0|The DVD would not play in 16X9 format, or in any other format, except for a very narrow image. After trying to make it work with various TV and DVD players I finally gave up and called Disney's tech support printed on the DVD case. Disney's tech support group says it is a pirated copy and that's why it doesn't play correctly. I am not happy that I was sold a pirated copy.
0807014273|4.0|Good book about the meaning of life. Didn't learn as much as I expected though, which is why I gave it just 4/5.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey has created a terrifying and vivid post-apocalyptic underworld. If you enjoy science fiction, you'll enjoy this book. But additionally, and impressively, the book requires the reader to consider the virtues of paternalism, government secrecy, and unchecked centralized control during dire and trying times. It is therefore not only an entertaining read, but also an important book to consider in light of contemporary events (e.g. the war on terror, classified information, and surveillance).
B006C1DH92|5.0|I  think that this game  is  so fun because  you  can  choose  between<br />the challenging part and the easy part
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved the characters--they were so real, and gave such an accurate account of what being this sick feels like for them.  The love story component was sweet-2 flawed humans finding joy in one another despite their &#34;lack of a future&#34; and daily obstacles of treatments, not feeling good and dealing with the well-meaning adults in their lives who just don't get it, and don't know what to do.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|My kids love it and so do the grandparents! Great game and I appreciate not having to spend money in it!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|38 Years into their career, Rush produce one of the best albums of their careers.<br />My personal favourite albums from this amazing band are... Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures, Power Windows, Counterparts and Vapour Trails, plus now Clockwork Angels.<br /><br />This is an energetic, exciting album, with a great story line and fantastic songs to match with perhaps the most beautiful and emotionally uplifting finale (closing track \\"The Garden\\") the band have ever made.<br /><br />The album flows really well and is as inspired as any of their best stuff from the past.<br /><br />I personally got into Rush in 1980, purchasing both 'Permanent Waves\\" and \\"Hemispheres\\" on the same day. Every year since then I've thought about making the trip from New Zealand to see these incredible musicians live.<br />After 32 years my wife of 30 years shouted me an early 50th birthday present... a trip of a lifetime to see Rush live in Las Vegas. On the 23rd November 2012 I was fortunate enough to witness my personal favourite band and concert ever, just short of 3 hours of Rush live at the MGM, where the bulk of this, their latest album was played.<br />It was such a great experience and pleasure to see the Clockwork Angels songs played live as it is an album the guys have clearly put a lot of work into and were really pumped to performing it live.<br /><br />I really cannot speak highly enough of this album, I really enjoy it and for me it just has so much freshness, thought, great playing and overall enthusiasm. If this sounds remotely like you, I hope you get it and enjoy it as much as I do.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I am enjoying this app.  It is like the Sims but way better!<br />Fun and creative with some education about dinosaurs.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I truly love this the best. I keep in touch with family and friends using this app daily! The best in social media!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a really good app if you need to know the weather. It is also stylish so that's a plus, and it does like a ten day forecast so you know the whole week and then some instead of just that one day. It sends you emergency alerts too and tornado warnings and stuff like that. Great app I recommend it:)
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The game is based on fast response to an obstacle course.  I had hoped for more intellectual demands with puzzles to be solved.  It has great graphics.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Movie in beginning got my attention,&#34;we won the war but lost the planet&#34;  thought it could show what these aliens look like but thats why I give 3 rating, to keep it abstract & cause Tom Cruise & Morgan Freeman chemistry doesn't work out as well as Christian Bale &#34;Batman Begins&#34; only because Tom Cruise of course has to control it, the star of the movie of course, while keeping Morgan Freeman at bay.  At least Tom Cruise is finally figuring it out without a good M83 sound track to go with the movie, I would of it given it a 2 rating. Russell Crowe movies whether a 1 or 5 rating realizes, a movie is only as good as the sound track to go with it. 3 rating for the movie 4 rating for the sound track
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Working through the scenes was difficult enough to be fun but easy enough not to frustrate.  I look forward to additional levels.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I watched this movie twice because I thought maybe I had slept through a crucial plot point. The movie moves at a confused pace. We take time to digest the broad devastation of our fair planet then we do a quick montage of the \\"droids\\" flying at impossible speeds and then slow down again to view the strained relationship of our tech worker and mate. Water is being sucked from the planet at an incredible rate yet there is plenty to create a floating pool for our hero. Said hero states to his \\"other half\\" that he thinks the \\"scavs\\" want to catch him and then they do. Lo and behold the \\"scavs\\" are human. All of a sudden these folk tell our hero they need his help to destroy everything our hero has been protecting and he seems OK with that.<br />I love Sci-fi, but this one is a head scratcher. There is not enough back story and too much emphases on CGI. The ride of Mr. Cruise on a motorcycle seemed only inserted so we could watch Tom Cruise on a motorcycle. Is it just me or did it seem like an \\"I feel the need for speed\\" moment when we saw the sunglasses on the shelf? Then there was the whole flight recorder anomaly, how could it play back data that happened after it was jettisoned? As I said in the headline, the movie is stunning visually, but the story line sucks, and in a few shots, poor Tommy is looking his age. It happens to us all.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This is a good basic dictionary.  It does not include all the obscure words one might encounter but does a good job for most.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This story is well written and grips your attention right away. I thought this book was better than the first.
6310292196|1.0|This was supposed to be a Blu ray....I think what I actually got is a HORRIBLE quality bootleg product... The movie quality was terrible.  The artwork on the sleeve was blurred...It even came with an ultraviolet redemption code that was invalid.  SCAM!!!
B00AO3K05S|5.0|Lots of intelligent insights. Keeps its promise from the beginning to the end. The case are very interested, the style is not boring. Learnt a great deal!
071815780X|4.0|Jamie's \\"15 Minute Meals\\" TV program is fun to watch and hooked us into buying the book. Several of the recipes do use ingredients that are hard to find in New Zealand, i.e. not pantry staples, however with a little substitution here and there, we can stick pretty close to the recipe. Of course what takes Jamie 15 minutes with the kettle boiled and pans hot takes us a little longer, so if you're looking for meals you can make in under an hour, this is a fantastic recipe book!
1601251831|5.0|the art is really good, the cover alone is one of the coolest troll pictures I have seen.  I am enjoying the pathfinder gaming system and this would be a must read.
0007229674|4.0|For those interested in Psychology, this is a very interesting read. Ramsay himself denies workaholism, but he is an exceptionally driven man. He puts his need to strive and succeed down to his tumultuous childhood and abusive father. It is certainly an good read if you don't mind the constant f-bombs - but it wouldn't be Ramsay without them.<br />It was definitely a page-turner, starting off with his childhood which reminds one of \\"Billy Elliot\\". Ramsay also muses that \\"Humble Pie\\" may one day be made a film for that reason. If you are a fan of the \\"Kitchen Nightmares\\" series then you will enjoy getting to know Ramsay even better through his story. As in Kitchen Nightmares, you get to see \\"the real Gordon\\" - behind the easily-angered Ramsay we know, we see the compassionate and generous man.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Gabysoft FlipPix Art puzzles always rock out. They are fun but challenging. They are great ways to pass hot summer days.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief is a well told, wonderfully narrated story, that addresses choices people make as tragedies and blessings fall all around them. It provides testament to the Power of Love & the Human Spirit. The characters are written clearly enough to be loved, pitied or studied, as if they were real. I intend to read more of Markus Zusak's work!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love playing games like this.  But need more levels.  Fun, challenging, some of them we were a little hard.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|Excellent; I was introduced to this series by my uncle and haven't been able to stop watching since. Seriously, evn on international airtravel.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I like the way the story goes. It doesn't seem to be a show around a typical legal dispute. The story involves a lot of different complicated situations which increase interest and fun. Characters are well defined and relationships among those characters are well organized to make the show more exciting.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Easy to use and great fun with the mpoints . When I get the weather I know it's right. Even works when I'm planning a trip I know I can count on here to tell me what to pack.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like the challenges always something more to do. It is time consuming and very addictive which can be bad .
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Its not exactly the same as the original (of course), but I did enjoy it and liked the characters. The story was pretty compelling and I also liked the foreshadowing, the blood, gore, and special effects were pretty nice as well. I'd make this part of my collection and would most likely watch it again.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|There is a very good story in there but the writing is very poor. I was pulling my hair out from the inconsistencies but continued to read it for the interesting story.<br /><br /> A good read for the younger audiences though.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Okay book. It's okay for if you like wimpy kid. After a while you get  bored  and take a break
B001XCWPAM|5.0|I am a big fan of the Bourne trilogy. After watching the movie, I had to own this collection. Speaking of the movie, Matt Damon is just superb. In addition to the intensity and drama, I just love all the action sequences. My personal favorite would be the fight sequence between Bourne and Desh in Bourne Ultimatum. I also loved the last scene of Bourne Utimatum when Bourne rises from the water. The direction is amazing. Overall definitely a must own collectible.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have always loved playing this game. His version is the best I have found. This game is good for maintaining concentration.qq
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I chose five stats because of the valuable life lessons for all ages.  Everyone can identify with this novel.  We judge others by their appearance.  We want to be accepted.  We fear change.  We fear rejection.  We all could be kinder.  We all need courage, a true friend, love.  Perfect book for middle schoolers.  Great realistic, emotional, funny read.
140006922X|4.0|Aslan's portrait of Jesus is probably more true to the man than the image many Christians have of him, but, like any author writing about Jesus, his book in some respects says more about the author than it does about Jesus. The fact that Aslan is a Muslim, an irrelevant fact that a twit who interviewed him for Fox news tried to use to discredit him as an author writing about Jesus, to her everlasting shame and embarrassment, does not detract at all from his book and the self-evident scholarship he brings to his work.<br /><br />The flaw I see in Aslan's portrait of Jesus as a zealous revolutionary is that it misinterprets a few snippets from the Gospels to mean Jesus was not a pacifist, whereas the bulk of what is known from the Gospels and the historical record proves the contrary. Aslan correctly, in my opinion, sees Jesus as a revolutionary leader who opposed his vision of the \\"kingdom of God\\" to the empire of Rome, which had subjugated the Jews' homeland by force of arms, and was mulcting its residents through taxes and tolls to sustain its oppressive control.  Aslan asks how the mighty Roman Empire with its legions was to be ousted from the Promised Land of the Jews if not by force, saying Jesus was nobody's fool, implying Jesus would realize that only force could accomplish the task. I believe this conclusion of Aslan's, which is an overarching element to the picture of Jesus he creates, shows Aslan has no understanding whatsoever of the power of nonviolent resistance, which is the only effective means of opposing a mighty oppressing force without doing more harm than good. Jesus certainly was nobody's fool, which is why he pursued nonviolent means to the ends he sought. Subsequently, leaders such as Gandhi, Martin Luther King and many other successful nonviolent revolutionaries have mimicked the methods of Jesus to overcome and dethrone mighty forces of violent oppression. And Rome no longer occupies Palestine, nor any other of its other subjugated territories, so Jesus obviously succeeded in his objective.  If Aslan was himself a pacifist he would see Jesus differently. Nevertheless, with all this said, I highly recommend Aslan's book for its realistic view and appraisal of the social, economic and political conditions extant in Palestine during the first century.<br /><br />What I think is a more accurate picture of Jesus as rigorously nonviolent is made by John Dominic Crossan in his 2006 analysis, [[ASIN:0060858311 God and Empire: Jesus Against Rome, Then and Now]]s, so Jesus obviously succeeded in his objective.  If Aslan was himself a pacifist he would see Jesus differently. Nevertheless, with all this said, I highly recommend Aslan's book for its realistic view and appraisal of the social, economic and political conditions extant in Palestine during the first century.<br /><br />What I think is a more accurate picture of Jesus as rigorously nonviolent is made by John Dominic Crossan in his 2006 analysis, [[ASIN:0060858311 God and Empire: Jesus Against Rome, Then and Now]]
1595828753|5.0|As before they do a great job with the whole story line. It almost seems like I'm watching the tv show on tv all over again instead of reading a book.
B004WO57E4|1.0|This product wont work with windows 7, the disc for heroes 2 only has music on it. Since this was shipped from England I wont be returning it. I also will never order from this vendor again. A complete ripoff, it hangs up with all the discs.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Love this app. Your puzzle library can grow as large as u like, with free puzzle available. They really have puzzles for everyone.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Wonderful, all the characters are perfectly cast.  The plot is very intriguing and the setting is authentic.  Don't miss this.

0783240287|5.0|This production of JOSEPH AND THE AMAZING TECHNICOLOR DREAMCOAT is one that will win your heart and have you singing some of this beloved musical's songs for years to come.  It's approach to the show, to incorporate an audience of school-children into the show as well as stage the whole thing as part of an afternoon of theatre in a School's \\"Cafetorium,\\" is unique. It raised my eyebrows at first, I had never seen JOSEPH staged like this, but in the end, it was a winning approach, effective, and I loved it.  The cast, Donny Osmond as Joseph, Richard Attenborough as the patriarch Jacob, Joan Collins as the slutty wife of Potiphar, are all simply magnificent. Donny's performance is warm and endearing (and his rendition of CLOSE EVERY DOOR (to me) coupled with the candle-lit staging of this powerful song, knocked the wind right out of me. WOW).<br />As the NARRATOR, Maria Friedman adds an incredible touch of gentleness and grace to this production.  Her voice is lovely, and her sweet face and beautiful smile could light up a hundred rooms.  I have loved \\"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\\" for over 34 years, I have the entire musical memorized, and this production left me pouring out tears of joy at the end, with as smile \\"as big as all outdoors\\".  I am sure all of you will love it too. -- Give me MY color-coat! -- Thank you so much, everyone involved, for a sweet, memorable and enormously-UPLIFTING production of one of my all-time favorite musicals. THIS production of JOSEPH...is really a winner.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My daughters and I really enjoy the app. Although there are similar apps out there Minion Rush is much more entertaining.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Great, exciting and seems accurate. Good acting even though you know the ending before you start watching it. If you like action, this is for you.
B007MDB71O|1.0|The pieces were there, but the storyline was ABSOLUTELY ruined buy some Hollywood idiot re-writing the excellent original story.  The script and storyline are abysmal at best.  If you are a John Carter fan like me, it's fun to see some of the ideas on screen.  The special effects and the Barsoomian world were nicely done, giving us a hint of what they could have created. However, the story was re-written and massacred.  Get the books and read them first.<br /><br />The new story is boring and disconnected -- an epic failure. There is no character development. I was glad it was over.
0670026557|5.0|Helped me understand myself and others better and brought clarity to why some communication styles work better than others and what I need (as a giver) in work and friendship to be happy and feel more gratified.  Bought a copy for a friend as well.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like the game so far but I haven't checked to see if I can play offline yet. Definitely a time killer and great for kids.
030758836X|1.0|I have never bothered writing book reviews before. I always thought to each his own, and that people have different tastes. But this book was so bad i felt like it was my duty to warn people not to waste hours of your life that you will never get back. For the life of me, I cannot figure out why Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn got such great reviews and awards. I rarely ever feel like i wasted my time reading a book and it is precious time i will never get back but i sure felt like that about this one. The sad part was it had an interesting premise so i wanted to see how it all turned out. If vampires had started glittering a few chapters in I would have at least thrown it out instead of plodding on. ugh! Slow start, horrible writing, dreadful characters and terrible ending! I need to really read a good book to get the bad taste of this one out!
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|Really cool game. Graphics are incredible, story is interesting, totally addicted! Oh, you want to play some more,huh? That'll be $5 please. Uhm NO.
B0098460O4|5.0|I love the way they sing together, they are very talented.  I love classical music!  They may eventually have separate careers, but right now they are having fun!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Its an alarm clock, and it works, and its free. Seriously, what more do you need? Ok but this one is cool because different days of the week I need to be up at different times and I can set this day by day and its saved so I dont have to worry about resetting it. It also has a gentle wake up feature that starts quiet and gets louder gradually. A little weak on the variety of tones but whatever, its free.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|my grandson loves this game. I like to play these games also. My grandson thinks it's funny when I win a game.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I'm only on level 4 but it seems ok. Artwork is good, tutorial was ok. I didnt know what i was supposed to do after the tutorial but thats probably because i wasnt paying close attention. Continuing to play. Thats a good sign.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|I love this game, works perfectly on my Galaxy S4 (i9000) and my Galaxy S4 (i9500). Graphics are great, sound is good. The actual gameplay is great, starts off easy, but some levels can be challenging, especially on Hard setting.

1400069742|2.0|This book has the typical anglophile bias common in the intellectual community. It should have stressed and explained in greater detail how the US was hoodwinked and tricked into bailing out the British and French with their Colonial empires in WWI. It was a sham to claim that it was a war for democracy when with their huge colonial empires held by force along with being allied with Czarist Russia the most reactionary power on the face of the earth it was completely untrue. Without American money and might the allies would have been defeated. Many Americans remembered this in the years before WWII and did not want american lives and money to once again bail out British Empire.  The British were again given carte blanch and we allowed them to keep their colonial empire and have far to much authority over the war effort given the huge american effort. The choice was not as the author makes it between letting the Nazis run wild or supporting the British. Our aid to the British and our entry into the war should have been contingent on changes in the British Empire as well as the dropping of Imperial Preference.
B008EKMB82|5.0|A wonderful world explaining the complexities of simplicity, time and living. It's deep and light; difficult and easy; real and unreal. Old Jiko would have loved it.
B0094M2Z9O|5.0|I watched this film for the first time 30 years ago.  It never grows old and the themes are always current, despite the age of the film.
B002LVVCQM|4.0|Dawkins explains the basic evidence for evolution in a clear and entertaining manner.  The statistics he sights on the extent that deniers' attitudes hold sway are reason enough for the book.  But it troubles me that addressing their position gives it more standing than it deserves.  They are in the are in the same league as Flat Earthers.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This app is the best in world GET it! Very good app! I love it very fun games for kids!
1452126577|2.0|This book is pretty much what you'd expect: pictures of Grumpy Cat captioned with expressions of distaste for humans, dogs, mornings, etc. There's only one basic joke (\\"Hey, Grumpy Cat looks grumpy! He hates everything!\\"), endlessly repeated. As Roger Ebert said, if you like this kind of thing, well, this is the kind of thing that you like.<br /><br />The thing is, I DO like this kind of thing, generally speaking. But I still can't find much to admire in this soulless, assembly-line production. It's fake and uninspired, and it's not even very funny.<br /><br />This is an interesting-looking cat that I would have loved to see in more than just front-facing head shots. Even his assigned, misanthropic persona has potential as a character study, were it developed beyond the \\"I hate everything\\" punch line.  But don't look for any of that stuff in this book.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game was very good. I hope they come up with something just as good very soon. Extremely nice graphics.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|Fun book but it seems like it has been done before.  Very 50 shades of gray like story line and even some exact phrases.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|Glad I bought this movie! Every time I watch it, I learn something more to helping understand the storyline.  Worth renting as well.  I'm a movie watcher who can watch a good film many times and I'm expecting to watch this a few times anyway.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|get ready to think! This game makes you think of how to solve the puzzles and apply the tools as you go. Can't wait for more levels
B00E978FGQ|5.0|If you appreciate magic, even just a little, you will love this movie.  The tricks are incredible and storyline keeps you wondering what direction it's going next.  Then the ending surprises you again, never saw that coming!  Watch it, you'll love it!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Really fun and cool to play as a family fast paced and better than original and  lots of fun and easy to use and play.
140006922X|5.0|This is an extraordinary piece of scholarship about the life and times of Jesus, the man. It cuts through many of the fables around Jesus, and it revealed to me the huge quantity of historical research that has been done on the forces within that society and particularly on the interaction and interdependency between the Romans and the Jews of that time. The story is, as is most often the case with people, a lot more complex than we have been led to believe. Those were harsh and wondrous times, written about with great skill.
0385474547|5.0|It took a while to get into the story, but once I did, I was smitten :) The story is fully of illustrative descriptions and I really enjoyed this book. I have always wanted to visit Nigeria and this book offered a a wonderful exploration into the culture.

B00CXVX1OQ|2.0|It was fun for five minutes and then I was bored. It's a nice looking game though. The gameplay was decent but I deleted it after an hour.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is such a great show! I love the variety of characters, the time period around WWI, the interplay of servants and aristocrats, and the beautiful castle! Very addicting too!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Could not put the book down. Enjoyed reading every page. Kept the reader wondering what was going to happen next.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Reza Aslan has provided a potent insight into Jesus of Nazareth. Must reading for those who seek to deepen their faith, stepping away from campfire stories about a &#34;benevolent brother&#34; to a muscular Jesus who devoted himself to change. This book isn't designed to &#34;shake you from your beliefs&#34; but to provide real, historical context to the &#34;greatest story ever told.&#34;
B003Q6D2BE|3.0|A little over the top but pure shoot-them-up entertainment.  Better that Red 2.  Great 'tounge-in-check acting&#34;.  Good stars enjoying themselves.

B009XIXVU6|3.0|This book came highly recommended but I really did not like it.  It jumped around too much.  I really love this author and loved the other books but was a little disappointed with this one.  Will try the next book written...I will not give up on this author!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Great app. It does what says. It is easy to use and configurable to do everything you need it to do.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|We wait impatiently for months the third book - to be a &#34;trilogy&#34; - then we cannot get off the computer chair as one's nose cannot leave the screen - every word draws one in deeper and deeper into the story - You try getting up after non-stop 22 hours of reading PAIN!  And THEN we SUFFER as we are left dangling in agony at the ending and have to wait for yet another book - and that won't be for some months - You cruel man Jeffrey Archer - but LOVE your books
B0088W7VNG|5.0|About to watch the last episode and I'm very sad. It's a great show overall though this season I do miss Dr Weir.
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|I love this author's writings and find ease of reading and story so enjoyable and relaxing - pure classic and a pleasure to have it on kindl.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is just like the coumputer version. but you have to be on the same wifi to play with your friends.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Played Blokus with my daughter and had to have it.  It's the best game we have discovered this year.  It captures the imagination of all ages 5+ .  The  whole family can enjoy it  together.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|A great spin on the Classic Star Trek film, awesome action and special effects. Top notch acting and one surprise cameo make this film one of the best of 2013 in my opinion. Benedict Cumberbatch as the villain is superb. Sad to see JJ abandon Trek for a Galaxy far far away, but if he can do for that franchise what he did for this one. I can only look forward to 2015 when that film comes out with great anticipation!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I had not watched this show till I had Prime. Now I am hooked!!!! It's a &#34;got to see&#34; show!!!!
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I like the choice of words and the way the writer leads you in a way you never actually who the killer is. However, by 60% of the book it becomes a bit repetitive.
B008NBEXZQ|5.0|what a beautiful cd! Each song is better than the last. I have gotten all the translations for the songs, and now I'm learning French in a much more fun way.
B006IYG5HE|3.0|Because I had to read the novel in short episodes, it was hard to follow.  If I had had time to sit and read it through, I think it would have been a better experience.  The shifting of times, the time it took to get the characters straight--all reduced the enjoyment of the puzzle.  But that was as much my problem  of time constraints as it was a problem with the book.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Excellent story..the write is so easy to read..highly recommend not only this book but all by the author khaled hossini. Gave me a better understanding of another culture
B005XQLBU4|3.0|good game. i like the changes of night and day and the upgrades are fine but wish there was more levels/Stages and variety in what you and the enemy shoots out. pretty generic just shooting missles at each other but overall its ok. not bad but not great. can get stale after the fourth night.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|I love this film, and have it on my &#34;must own&#34; DVD list.  A must-see for any Robert Deniro or Ray Liotta fan!!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This movie is, just, wow. I've loved this movie my whole life.  I'm hoping to get this tear-jerker again for my birthday in November, the same month this movie came out. Recently, I found my old platinum edition (which is 12 years old) before I had a babysitting job and was dissapointed when it started skipping 15 minutes into the movie, because I wanted to bring it with me. I seriously can recite monolouge from the movie and know all the songs. If you have a small child, buy this movie, and maybe 12 years from now they'll be buying a replacement copy after falling in love and watching it so many times to the point it's fried, like I did.
B002NN5F7A|3.0|Stellar cast, superb acting, but I personally did not enjoy the story line.  It was easily understandable, but the movie wasn't what I thought it would be.  If you are a major fan of Alan Arkin, Al Pacino, Kevin Spacey and Jack Lemmon - then it is a must see.
1572704764|3.0|In Sad Cypress Agatha Christie sets up her mystery a bit differently than in most of her other books.  That is, it begins in a courtroom scene where a young woman is standing trial for murder.  The story begins from the point of view of the accused young woman and remains there through most of the book, as the story then goes back in time to the beginning of the drama.<br /><br />This \\"inside view\\" is a bit unique to Agatha Christie and added to the puzzle.  That is, the reader is made sympathetic to the murder suspect because the story is told from her vantage point, even though the evidence accumulates against her from the beginning, and yet the reader somehow knows from the very beginning that she isn't guilty.<br /><br />All of this makes for a great set-up that caused me to anticipate a stunning ending.  Alas, I found the ending very disappointing.  Hercule Poirot is consulted by a young man who loves the accused woman and who wants her freed, whether she is guilty or not.  Poirot agrees to take the case, which was puzzling in itself since he hadn't even a thread of doubt as to her guilt and so there seemed to be no reason for him to get involved.  But get involved he does and, of course, he gradually begins to ferret out facts that raise doubts and questions.  However, when the truth is revealed it is not by Poirot at all but by the defense attorney in the courtroom.  How in the world did he come to be in possession of the facts?  This hole in the plot, and the fact that the facts were presented in such a dry, mater-of-fact way made the ending very flat, anti-climatic and disappointing.<br /><br />David Suchet does a good job of narration.  I don't care for his style quite as much as that of Hugh Fraser, but still it is enjoyable.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|this film tells a sweet story of science and redemption. the hero was well developed but the story went a little off course with the good  witch.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|It was funny and cleverly written. My wife and I both enjoyed it. Seven more words required for review here.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|This is a great Jesse Stone novel by Robert B. Parker and if you enjoy this series, including the movies, you'll like this book
1609611543|5.0|After reading this book I went gluten free.  The next month my husband followed.  He has always had stomach problems but no longer has issues.  Best thing we ever did for our health.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|If you love Jesse Stone and the TV series with Tom Selleck, you will love this excellent DVD series.  Watch them all.
B00007KWHO|4.0|Yes' second album is different to say the least. In a very bold move, they decided to hire an orchestra to give their sound a more robust feel, at the expense of two key members, Tony Kaye (keyboards) and Peter Banks (guitar). These two guys had their respective instruments put in the deep background, almost to the point of being completely drowned out by the orchestral arrangements. Banks can be heard on ASTRAL TRAVELLER, with his catchy opening riffs, while Kaye pops up here and there, especially on the cover of Buffalo Springfield's EVERYDAYS. I give this album 4 stars because the songs are pretty good, though I still disagree with the 'experiment.' Another good song is THEN, which is probably the most balanced of the set, while CLEAR DAYS is a heartfelt piece showing another side of the band, similar to Sweetness, from their first album. The title track is okay, but lacks progressive elements; it's simply a ballad that seems out of place. Overall, this album is good, but way down my list of favorite Yes albums. Definitely worth a listen.
B004XE0TDW|5.0|This was purchased for a person as a Christmas Gift and it was something he really wanted, so it was a good gift.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is an awesome book to read...  This is my first Kindle book and I really enjoyed using my kindle white to read this book...  A must read who loves John Grisham...
B00004WX4U|5.0|Bought this for a son who really loves Jeff Buckley.  Too bad he died young because he was very talented.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Missile defense but with upgrades.  Intuitive play style with on screen instructions. Also able to repair your buildings to help you stay in the fight longer.
B003F5WOEC|5.0|My son is a great lover of vinyl records and he was very happy to receive this as a Christmas Gift.
B00DU74U74|1.0|This movie is not at all what it looks like in the preview.  It is horribly boring.  It has horrible acting, writing, and just about everything else. Don't waste your time or money.  Perhaps if you are a preteen girl you might think it OK. Otherwise, if you rent this movie, you will wish you had listened to my review.
1451627297|5.0|I haven't read Stephen King for many years, but a friend of mine said I had to read \\"11/22/63\\" and boy am I glad I did. A \\"can't put it down book\\" (literally)...I read 845 pages in 3 days...Awesome book. Highly recommended to all readers, whether a S.K. fan or not. Probably his best work to date, in my opinion.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Great book from beginning to end. Great description and building of characters. You really felt that you knew each one.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love the convenience of evernote. I use it to take sermon notes, for my daily journal, for record keeping...endless possibilities.<br />I think it is an excellent app and considering it is free, you can't lose. By far the easiest of any note or diary app as it is accessible through all devices.<br />I wish there were a few more formatting options, like larger don't size on mobile device, and perhaps stationary, but all in all, can't be beat.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I will share this book with my two nieces who are both close to earning their bachelor's degrees. I totally agree that spreading this message is important and banding together will make the difference. Thank you!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I originaly purchased this game for my kids. But after watching my kids play I got sucked in. Lots of fun.
B009AY04A8|5.0|Its fun and it will keep u entertainmented for hours. I play it at work and I had played it on the computer before.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|A great game to play,but why pay over $100 for just ONE of the ponies?<br />When expanding it costs a lot of money also.<br />It's a good game, but WAY overpriced!
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|It is like the first but they added more things and it is a lot better than the first one.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have been playing this for months now and I have found it to be a great game. It has rooms to complete that give you brilliant rewards and a great sense of achievement on completion. The community is lovely and its perfect to play on the kindle. Great for a free bingo fix!!!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I got this app yesterday and already I have been playing it nonstop. I recommend this game to Sims City fans.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|This game takes a long time to  downlod!!!!4 me it takes 4 horers :(!!!help me&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!! I just wanna play D:
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Customize your monkey, say it right and it sounds filthy, and who doesn't enjoy a little filth with boxing monkeys.
1595825045|5.0|Loved how it come in almost a month earlier<br />it was in perfect condition and it was exactly what i wanted
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Got mine the other day. Setup was NOT all that easy but not that hard either. Problem: mine will stream all the services EXCEPT Netflix. It just sits there and loads, and loads. Nothing. Obviously a Netflix bug.
B00B97SNJI|5.0|Dawes is one of my favorite bands; Stories Don't End is a good album. I still think their best work is North Hills and the work Taylor Goldsmith did with Middle Brother.<br /><br />Stories Don't End moved a little mainstream with this album. They toured with Jackson Browne and this album has a lot of his influence. There is also a hint of Steely Dan in here. The influence isn't bad, it just softens their work. What I like so much about their music is the raw edge, and there is less of it in this album. Taylor Goldsmith writes great lyrics, they are visual and twist and turn in unexpected ways.<br /><br />From A Window Seat is a perfect example. I travel way more than anybody should ever be in a plane, Goldsmith captured how I feel about plane rides perfectly. Why people next to him don't talk, or does he just make trouble everywhere? In the closing refrain he turns the song around to himself. Without knowing it, maybe he does make trouble. This is also a song that channels Jackson Browne and Steely Dan deeply; the rhythm guitar could be from Doctor My Eyes or Running On Empty; Deacon Blues or Rikki Don't Lose That Number.<br /><br />This is a good album. It is smoother than their previous work, a little more produced. Dawes is still an amazing group.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B004FS2SHG Middle Brother]]<br />[[ASIN:B002LMOAZ6 North Hills]]
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Reading this on the last day of summer was the most perfect thing. Not quite a fairy tale, but I feel that I've been touched by magic.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's a refreshing challenge of the mind helps to think analytically. You have to be able to think outside of the box and your comfort zone<br />It's somehow like solving a mystery or a math puzzle.
B001I45UFC|5.0|This book is great for any age group. It is very readable and fun. The narrative also does what all good narratives do. It not only transports us into a story, but uses that story to transport us to a deeper understanding of reality and our stories.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Super villain Gru adopts 3 girls in aid in an attempt to steal the moon.<br /><br />Good graphics, dialogue, and humor fill this film.  As the story/plot progresses, the characters change, grow, and learn.<br /><br />Overall, a heartwarming and humorous ride!
B0042JSMV4|5.0|Lots of variations and ideas, very helpful.  Cleared up a few hitches i'd experienced<br />in various projectd i've worked on in the past
B0033PQUXA|5.0|I love it because it brought back memories of my kid brother who was an altar boy & looked just like &#34;To-To in the movie. It brought tears to my eyes.  Thank you for showing it
B00CX7TOOG|3.0|Great acting in this movie though the story is a bit boring.<br /><br />You basically have two old guys (one us military, other serbian death squad/terrorist) running around in the woods beating the stuffing out of each other.  It plays out as it should but slight twist on the ending.  Ends up being a \\"I learn from you, you learn from me\\" movie.<br /><br />Shot well, paced well, there's just very little meat to the story in my opinion.  It's watchable and fairly interesting but you'll probably want to rent it before buying.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|One of the best books I read in a long time.  Really makes you think about the life vs. death question.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Written in an easy-to-read style. Decent analysis-what I like so much is how the book got me thinking about these issues again--which are always in my face--and gave me some encouragement to deal with it more effectively (as far as that is possible).
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I love playing this game; it is hours of entertainment on long car trips and a great way to enjoy the Kindle with my son. My husband has the game on iPhone and has received updates that give hero's some awesome card packs, but I have yet to see it on the Kindle...
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I read it with the same enchantment that I would watch an Aurora Borealis.  Subtle and heart breaking. I enjoyed the subtle psychology of the characters.
B00AHJL7BK|3.0|It did not attract me so I never used it. Sorry but I cannot rate this product for anyone to use
B000002KXV|5.0|Consider me old school, but I still like to receive a physical item when I buy something. So I bought the CD from Amazon.<br /><br />What I didn't know is that when you buy it from Amazon, you get to download it instantly as well. So when I bought it, it was instantly available. And I didn't have to rip the CD to put it on my devices. I stated listening to it the night I ordered it. I still haven't opened the physical CD.<br /><br />Oh, and the album? Classic Donald Fagan. If you're down with Steely Dan, this album fits right in. &#34;The Nightfly&#34; is brilliant. No flaws at all. A can't miss buy, especially from Amazon.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is an enjoyable game. Always a new way to solve the puzzles. Great just to relax and unwind. Fun too!
B008O9V4C2|4.0|Consider me old school, but I still like to receive a physical item when I buy something.

If you get the chance, &#34;hold on to that Slinky Thing.&#34;
B00D7JGL36|5.0|One of the best out now  excellent versions of buck Owens and company. I would buy it again. Love it!

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|great Iwould recomend  my grandsons love it. Im just exploring my new kindle and have allot to learn about it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book and just put Moriarty's other books on my wish list!  I highly recommended this book to read.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Great game tons of fun but it is extremely difficult on my phone because finger input is inaccurate. Now on my samsung galaxy note 10.1 I have digitizing pen. on my phone it was very difficult to get anywhere without getting tons of damage to my buildings.navita vice with the digitizing pan I've got to level eight so far with a perfect score.regardless of that fact it's still a lot of fun on either device.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have never used any other e reader but this is so simple to use and quick to download the books
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Had not idea what the movie was about, but I really enjoyed the story once I got  'into' it.  Love the minions.  They are so cute.  It's a good morality play.  Good versus evil.  Good triumphs!!
B00B81B0HC|5.0|These songs are great.  I love listening to Imagine Dragons.  Their music is exactly the kind of music I regularly consume.
159463176X|5.0|A multi-generational story that crosses borders and times. I had hoped it would be as good or better than Hosseini's two previous novels, and I was not disappointed!
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|Great song.  Easy to listen to; it has a nice zippy beat without being rushed, Lorde's voice is awesome, overall more than pleasant.
B004LUHQ1G|4.0|I am new to FF but I really enjoyed this more than \\"The Colour and the Shape\\" (which is also highly enjoyable).  The growling/screaming is not irritating and the loud energy is great.  Very very good band. I look forward to acquiring more cd's and watching the documentary.
B00BF11STU|4.0|This is a very suspenseful movie even though most people know how it ends.<br /><br />My main problem is: how much artistic license did the writer and director employ?<br /><br />With historic movies like this I like to see what really happened (almost like a documentary) and I care less about a good story.<br /><br />Still, it it was well worth watching.
B0045HCIZY|4.0|A bit of a 'sleeper', this one grows on you. Very dialogue driven (and isn't THAT a rarity these days!), the viewer develops an interest in these two - even care about their fate - and makes the viewer think back whistfully to perhaps similar occurrences in your own life ... what if?). Overall: good
0812993292|5.0|Recommended by friend, The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry held my attention and told a wonderful allegorical tale. Very creatve story.
B0002YLC24|4.0|Picking up ten years after Before Sunrise, this ahd the proragonists resuming theirt broken one day relationship. Now successful novelist (Hawke) and international development consultant (Delpy), they find that Delpy lived in New York for a few years (where Hawke's character lives - and close by where Delpy lived) earning a masters degree ... (Does Hawke's character recall a fleeting glimpse of a woman who looks like Delpy's character one day some years back in NY?) They face the question, should hawke leave his wiofe and child and live with Deply?  We are not told. Again, characterised by solid dialogue throughout, it draws the viewer in as we become almost voyeurs - and I think 'urguing them on'.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really liked this game and was dissapointed to find out there are only 10 levels!  It was fun while it lasted!
B002W7J3SO|5.0|Classic movies such as I am, you will enjoy this movie. One would never know it is almost 2hrs long. It just kept my interest which can be a difficult thing to do as is. I honestly wish the charm of these classics would return to our movie theaters.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|All I can say is WOW!!! This album rocks from start to finish! Bought it right after it came out, not sure what to expect. I was totally blown away! This has to be Megadeths best album to date. I listen to it every single day. On the way to work, on the way home from work, even out running errands with the wife.<br />Listening right now as I write this review. This has to be THE best album I've heard in years. Can't wait for the next one Dave!!!
B002RSQGQK|5.0|A real classic. So well written. I must admit to admiring Grace Kelly's costumes as well. I would like to see this kind of acting and movies written more like this. I am just so darn tired of no real script, nothing but special effects and no real 'acting.'
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Off the chain for sure.  He should have won an award for this movie for sure.  It is always painful to see what happened during those times, it was good to see a movie with revenge in it for a change.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|What is not to like with Cary Grand and Grace Kelly? The scenery was splendid and the little car she drove...I want one!
B005OK721G|5.0|This movie reminded me of another movie where there was a woman called Maggie who seemed to be unstoppable and unbeatable.  Lots of action,  Keeps u entertained for sure.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Highly recommend this one. Well written and directed. Showed the real side of a great man. Don't hesitate to watch.
B00005JLT5|5.0|I could really feel what was going on at that place and time.  It was superbly portrayed.  Saw it on cable first then ordered it.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|We watched this because my husband wanted to. It's is not the worse I have ever watched but is most certainly not a chick flick. LOL
B00CKKHB0A|5.0|Dramatic fun a la film noir:<br /><br />The series takes on so much depth in just 12 episodes in the 7th season.  While it still has its cheesy melodramatic moments (let's face it - we like it for those reasons as well), the characters become much more 3-dimensional, thereby leaving the viewer w/out a clear hero or anti-hero, as the case may be, to route for.  The moral dilemmas it raises are obviously thought-provoking & disturbing, while the twists & turns leave you on the edge of your seat wondering who'll end up next on Dexter's table.
B004VF68AQ|5.0|Great album! Glad Jane's is still puttin out hits... one of the all-time great bands! Can't wait for their next one!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Very useful and easy to use. I always know the status of my battery and when it needs charging. Takes out all the guess work.
140006922X|5.0|Fantastic work. Definitely not the usual predictable book on the subject. Intelligent, thought provoking, and affirming that Jesus was indeed...way cool.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|This series was a bit hard to get into at first, but the more I watched it I have thoroughly enjoyed it!  It was perfect to have running in the background as I worked on homework; it was calm, but has great moments of comic relief.  I could relate to the characters or could say, &#34;that reminds me of so and so.&#34;  It was also shipped in great condition!!
B00969PR18|4.0|good app, no real problems with it, may get thefull ver. some time soon. it's not google maps but for what we can get it isn't bad
140006922X|5.0|Brilliantly written and researched: I wanted to have tea with the author afterwards! Appreciate Jesus and the times he lived in even more than before reading this book!
B007N5YIUS|1.0|I don't like it because it is very frustrating because of the gravity aspect of it. Would not pay money for it, glad I didn't.
0142410373|4.0|I bought this book to give to an 8 year old, but decided to read it myself before giving it away. Dahl is one of my favorite authors and I had read many of his books to my children. His deliciously skewed and humorous descriptions of Matilda's parents and Miss Trunchbull kept me chuckling. Although his evil characters are overblown, Dahl manages to keep a kernel of truth within them. We have all known people like Mr. and Mrs. Wormwood and Trunchbull, and that's what makes his stories so readable. For a child, identifying with Matilda is easy - they all want to triumph over the overbearing and disinterested adults, and help those who are kind and generous. This is a book for the overlooked child in all of us.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best and I would rate it one million if I could! It's awesome and me and my sister love it
B003XMAD3G|5.0|Like another user, I tried this on my Synology DS1813+ and it works. (It was at that time cheaper than the 1066Mhz version, which is more commonly used for Synology RAM upgrades).  As far as I can tell, the system works as before, but has twice the original RAM.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Thing is that when I updated it the word icons glitches out and don't  work sadly. If anyone could help me cause I like this so much
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I didn't really watch the season of American Idol that Phillip Phillips won. So when I heard this CD after hearing \\"Home\\" on the radio, I was floored. I expected a ton of filler with a couple of good songs.  No -- this CD completely stands on its own. The best word I can use to describe it is eminently listenable.  I just enjoy each song so much.  Every song tells a story and I am so happy to see that P2 was able to be himself on this CD without excessive record company intervention. Thank you Jimmy Iovine!<br /><br />Best songs you may not know about yet (that are very radio-worthy):<br />Where We Came From<br />Man on the Moon<br />Get Up Get Down<br />So Easy (I bet Adam Levine of Maroon 5 is asking himself why he didn't get to sing this song)<br /><br />I can't say that I own a single Dave Matthews CD. Phillips's style is reminiscent of DMB but it's not as if he is trying to copy him. P2 sounds like P2.<br /><br />This kid is going places. He's not the opening act for John Mayer for nothing!<br /><br />Buy this CD and you won't regret it.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|So excited to have the 9th season. I now have all of the seasons on DVD. Great buy. Highly recommend to any Grey's fan. Shipping was fast and it arrived on time. No damage. Truly pleased.
0679745203|5.0|Great ideas in the pages of this book and very beautifully written. It was in very good condition. Thank you!
B008MM9630|5.0|When it plants wither u just click on them to revive them! U don't need money to play this game!! Fun for the whole family. I play for hours!
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|I love this game. it makes you think quite a bit.<br />I would like to see a more clear description of what the points awarded for each game are for. what are the max points for each board? how do i lose points? right now it is just an arbitrary number.  I would also like to see a new way for inputting numbers. the current way inputs the wrong number far too often since you can accidentally drag your finger along the numbers.<br />overall it's agreat game and interface.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game. I really like the fact that you can interact with other people. I have a lot of friends!!!!!!!!
0374275637|5.0|I became interested in this book via a reference in a book by Nissam Nicholas Taleb. It was worthwhile to follow up the reference to Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow. Kahneman's book offers much insight into how people think the way they do and why they think the way they do given various biases. I am on my second read of the book.
B0042J6VUS|2.0|I was looking for a sturdy holder for my iPhone and thought this was is it &#34;aluminum&#34;. The tripod was not much interest but I expected that the threaded section would be standard and I could use this on a normal tripod. Wrong. The part that holds the camera is plastic and my iPhone 5 fits with pulling it to extremes and applying a lot of pressure. I do use a case but it adds less than 1/8&#34; to dimensions used by this holder. The tripod is okay but the phone will cause this to topple over if you do not extend legs and put them in the correct orientation for balancing.<br /><br />My expectations were not met...I expected all aluminum and also a standard fitting on the threaded portion.<br /><br />&#34;Sometimes low price is not enough to satisfy&#34;. If you do not have my expectations then this is a good buy.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Silly plot, bad acting, but kind of fun because of the nostalgia factor of all these old action stars together. The tongue-in cheek appearance of Chuck Norris and self-deprecating humor toward the end by Arnold and Bruce was kind of enjoyable.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I love 3/d and this is top quality 3/d along with a wonderful story line. I highly recommend this blu-ray for your 3/d collection.
030758836X|3.0|I was really intrigued with this book for the most part.  Interesting story and characters. About 2/3 of the way in the story began to dwindle and suffering through the last stretch, I was deeply disappointed with the ending. I'm left angry and confused how a good novel goes to hell right before your eyes.  I'm really frustrated that I wasted my time expecting to read an amazing novel.
B00AC8ZJ6K|1.0|I watched this movie on my Amazon Prime account, so I didn't actually pay for it, at least not specifically. Guess I can be thankful for that anyway. Truth is I didn't know that this movie was linked to a video game. I didn't even know they did stuff like that. That said, and since I kept falling asleep through it, I'll give the Cliff Notes version: I thought the movie was pretty dumb, poorly written, not very well acted, but very, very loud. I guess that's why I kept waking up, because it was so damn loud. Okay, maybe I'm not being fair because I'm probably a little too old to enjoy such nonsense, and truth be told, I never play video games. In fact, I stopped playing video games shortly after Space Invaders and Pac Man came out. lol. So maybe I'm not the right person to give a fair evaluation of what I thought was an annoying, idiotic, poorly executed, very loud movie. But there it is anyway.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|this have is fun to play if u have a smart or sharp brain because u have to think alot because have to understand the picture in order to answer
B000FC0SIM|5.0|An enjoyable book that makes learning fun and tells you what you need to know. This is the INSTRUCTIONS. Nobody likes to read the instructions, but Stephen King gives you advice and inspiration.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I'm doing this based on the game developers asking me to do this for 50 extra points in the game to repair something or buy it. It is Kinda odd that they offer things for reviews. Just wonder if it requires 5* which I will find out
B006MW3V6U|5.0|People at work kept talking about this show and I hadn't had a chance to watch it. I am so glad I finally got to watch it. It's very entertaining. Sometimes, the acting is a little strained, but for the most part I've enjoyed it.
0312379293|5.0|WIFE LOVES THIS AND HAS BOUGHT OTHERS B Y ARCHER AND SHE GETS DEEPLY INVOLED IN THE BOOK ANBD IS SO GOOD SHE EVEN IGNORES ME, BUT SHE WOULD STAND BY IT
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|best game ever you should get it its so fluffy you can get so many power ups rock on get it for all your electronics

B00D6QU6RW|4.0|loved  it the first four were my fav one isnt my style of music but love the rest of it
B000PUV1ZI|2.0|This movie used to be one of my favorites when I was a kid. But now, It was hard to follow the plot. And It is a great movie for a lot of people- just not for me. I guess my tastes have changed a bit!
B0006AAS5G|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband and he loved it. We had to bring it to a department store to get it re-sized but that is expected with any watch.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun game gives me something to relax my mind at night. great game that's free great in my book thanks
B004AQR29C|3.0|Typical action, not much of a storyline, nice so many action guys teamed up for a movie, but in the end it barely kept my attention.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|True Jack Reacher Novel,great suspense until the end. I could not put the book down until I finished it. Definitely 5 star.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is a must read!  I laughed, cried, and will definitely read it again!  An amazing view on World War II!
B005ZI2ZUK|5.0|My three year old loved this and as soon as I got to the last line he was shouting out suggestions.<br />Extremely engaging, well-written and lots of fun. The illustrations are clear and help provoke ideas.<br />As usual Peter Collier has created an inspirational book for children.
B004AQR29C|4.0|I loved seeing all the old action heroes together. Great action and funny too! Looking forward to seeing 2 and 3.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Love the style and the simplistic approach. It lacks some basic functions though like square root, sine, cosine and tangent.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun for the whole family. From the youngest to the oldest, we all share and try go reach the highest score.
030758836X|1.0|Doesn't anyone in today's world take exception to the filthy language and scenes set up in this book???  What happened to good, pure, wholesome literature suitable for anyone who wants to read a good mystery?<br /><br />Great story but couldn't stomach all the utterly disgusting language!!  I hope people do not really speak that way!!
B0001VTPWM|5.0|Came in Great time , and exaclty as described , and is A Must for any , and all 80'S Movie's - Electronics, Beginnings
B00993I6D2|5.0|Most movies are not good adaptations of the book.  This one does a good job.  The sets were very well done.
B00B4804KS|5.0|I have always loved this movie and can watch it again and again, so I bought the 3D version and it is fantastic.
B001XUYA0W|5.0|What dynamic performances all the actors played their roles as if they lived their rolls. The story line was dynamic, impactful, and powerful! This is a movie I will watch many times again.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|this alarm worked great at first, but for the last few nights it hasn't.  I got this because of the multiple alarm sets so I could get up to check baby chicks to make sure their temperature is even during the night. it stopped working, so I uninstalled it and then reinstalled it, didn't help. I'm going to try to find one that works consistently.
B006CUDDUG|3.0|Maybe I've seen too many spy movies over the years now that the &#34;Wall&#34; is down but I just couldn't care about these characters. They seemed bloodless, full of names and dates and little else.  I gave myself permission to end my involvement.  The author's intro congratulating himself on how fast he wrote it was a turn off for me.<br /><br />I've read some of his other books. His descriptions are often amazingly wonderful.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This game can be relaxing and fun. I live the way I can come back and redo a course to better my score or just for fun.<br /><br />Love this game.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Great reading, the Kindle one, is great, read at home at my tablet, and if I had a spare hour at my job, I'm a Corporate chef, I can also read a little at my phone.<br /><br />The  book is wrote in a very colloquial language, and walks you to the highs and lows of the bumpy road to be a &#34;chef&#34;.<br /><br />At my context, thou very hard to be a real chef too, the inside reality is quite different. But I compel all my staff to read it an discuss it.<br /><br />If you are planning to make the kitchen your way of life, STOP, read this first, then make up your mind... At least you won't be able to say that nobody tell you...
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The book was a little slow getting into for me.  It had a pretty good story with nice twists but was just not that exciting.  It's an easy read and was enjoyable.
140006922X|5.0|This book is solidly based on historical fact.  Aslan exhaustively notes all his sources for his information.  The assumptions the author makes concerning the intent of Jesus is prefaced with what is known historically.  I don't totally go along with his conclusions, but they gave me food for thought, which is exactly what I wanted from this book.
B008D28HYS|3.0|Alot of fun and challenging. Cool to see how the pictures come together in the end. Great for all ages. My youngest likes to color his own picture when I'm done and my older two like to race each other see who can solve it faster. Great for road trips!
B004LZFWJO|5.0|Candy Swipe is my nightly entertainment. I keep trying to improve my score. I am not there yet but I will keep trying!
B002JC9RMY|1.0|Only one word that can describe this movie.... \\"FAIL!\\" I watch this movie for about 10 mints of this movie and just turn it off. If your a DBZ fan, just watch the first 10mints on youtube & after that 10mints of the movie, you will be \\"WTF\\"? the acting was Bad, the fighting was bad and the Graphics was bad.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is great for general age of 8+. I think game is fun for a lot of kids. (Ones who can read) But you should really be able to rename your first horse. I know a lot of kids who don't care but some do. This is why I gave this game a four-star rating instead of five. But other than that this app is great! Def. a great game! :)
B001NW8D7G|5.0|brilliant reissue and top quality release, highly recommended for any lover of the Bee Gees A+++++ go out and get it now!!!!
B00942Y4IY|5.0|have seen this movie several times and will see it again and again... great concept and wonderful effects.  loved it
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I liked the book but I think James Dashner is a Misogynist from the way he killed the only girls in the story and let only let one live but she was in a coma for more than half the story, locked in jail and the poor girl was so mistreated! But other than that it was very good especially for those readers who like action and mysteries a maze actually ;) Boys will especially like this!
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|An amazingly true, real movie! Although this movie is about the American Dream, viewers can learn a lot about life from this phenomenal picture! Don't live this life as if it will last forever.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|great ending  kept me thinking! you should read this book  easy to read and he kept me wanting to know what was next  Jack is a tough guy!
6305428050|5.0|1980's and early 1990's classic, language of course because of the time period, but a great movie for preteens of both genders.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|This is another great album from the great legendary ALICE IN CHAINS....Yes, we all miss layne, but the band move on and create 2 great albums with Jerry Cantrell taking the lead vocals.....I think DEVIL PUT DINOSAURS HERE is heavier and better than BLACK GIVES WAY TO BLUE....Both got amazing songs, but this one put some of ALICE's all time best stuff like STONE, PRETTY DONE, the dark title track, LAB MONKEY,HOLLOW, PHANTOM LIMB and HUNG ON A HOOK....William Duvall is a great singer and his vocals reminds A LOT layne's style.....The band is powerful and Cantrell's guitar is simply unique.....many tried to copy his somber HEAVY style, but he is the one.....Well, i grow up loving FACELIFT , DIRT and JAR OF FLIES, and DEVIL PUT DINOSAURS HERE is now a new ALICE favourite of mine....REALLY GREAT!!!!WELL DONE!!!!!!!
B004R13U6Y|3.0|This app does everything you need in a pdf reader and a lot of things you never knew you needed. It quickly became a necessary tool for me and was well worth the price.<br /><br />Then I realised its one giant flaw.  Even though this is a paid app, for some reason you can't use it if you don't have an Internet connection. No studying on camping trips. No getting any work done in the car on road trips. No walking over to the park to work outside when the weather is nice.<br /><br />I love this app, but I have to recommend staying away from it.  You get used to using it, it becomes necessary to your work, and then you find yourself chained to your wireless router.<br /><br />There is just no excuse for requiring Internet access to use a paid app that is not add supported.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Such talent, acting, sets, music, performed in Australia, grabs and holds the emotions of the viewer. Whoever created the sets, the magnificent sets,  is a genius:  Coney Island freaks,  the peacock scene, the bridge above the stage, the very walls are fluid.  The costumes, the powerful acting and singing of the main characters and the 3 clowns is superb.  Can't put it down, shut it off, leave the room.  Spellbinding. and o so dark, very sinister, frightening. Gives goosebumps.  Stresses look for the beauty underneath.  Maybe too dark for some viewers.  Probes the dark side of humans and what they choose to do to get their end. Shows the triumph of the higher side of human nature, too, when disaster stuns. It is a soap opera musical set on stage in a grand larger than very dark life way.  And it completes, is the follow up to the Phantom of the Opera.  I am ready for another  follow up!  There is more story that can be found here.
B0000844I8|2.0|Not my type of actors, the story is good but Jack O'Neil is not himself, good to watch and put back in the rack after and forget for awhile.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Playing it on samsung note 2. Pros: it's not on a dark background like a lot of these types of games, which makes it difficult to find objects; it doesn't penalize you for touching the screen to see a different part of the screen; you can turn off the timer; the graphics are nice. Cons: the dialog screens are sometimes fast, sometimes slow and I wonder if necessary; on my phone,the scene change makes the phone go to sleep.  All said, I'm enjoying playing the game.
B008IJHIAA|4.0|A great album, especially for every REM fan. The bonus tracks of the second album are great that's what I wanted,a live album.
B002TXZRRM|5.0|Love the series so much I bought the whole series in paperback for my bookshelf. Will certainly promote this series.
B000MV90IU|5.0|Classic-Mcqueen- the Mustang and Charger chase scene! On blu-ray its worth the price.got it fast.Arrived in very good condition,get it! while its avialibile.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I'm not sure why everyone loves the series. I kept falling asleep trying to read it! Won't read the rest.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|I love anything that Vince Gill sings!  He is just the &#34;cat's meow!&#34;  If you like Vince Gill, then you will love this CD!
B0055MBQOM|4.0|The ColorMunki is an incredibly valuable tool if you are doing color sensitive monitor work. If you are photo editing, designing, printing, etc you absolutely use a color profiling tool. This tool in particular works well but it requires a few tries to get to something that looks \\"right\\". I realize \\"right\\" is subjective but in the case of the ColorMunki there isn't enough instruction on what the varying white points mean or do. D65? D50? Native? I realize all of that information is available elsewhere however you'd think it would be here in the software so that you don't spend 10 minutes each time to end up with something that makes all your grays have a red-ish hue and so on. It took 5 tries with various settings to get one monitor done. Around an hour and a half when all was said and done. Once you get through the high learning curve you can get some great results which is why this still gets 4 stars. Best to do the calibration in the dark and shoot for a target brightness. Forget about the ambient light adjustment provided with the tool. So far I've used this on a high end desktop monitor and 2 macbook pro retinas.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This is a good game for when you have five minutes to kill, but don't expect to be playing it for hours on end.
B00DHHWXYY|4.0|I was waiting for this to come out on DVD.  I really enjoyed seeing it in the theater and the special features are extensive.  You can tell they spent a lot of time and effort preparing the additional disc.  Anyway, the movie is heartbreaking.  Yes there is a lot going on, especially at first, but then it settles down into a touching love story.  Leonardo is at his best and just nails his performance.  Yes, Baz's style is not for everyone, but he is always true to the story and that's what counts here, like in Romeo and Juliet.  I think it is wonderful and well worth the price.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|It should make anyone want to investigate Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.  A real love affair that lasted until she died.  An amazing story.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|GREAT ACTION and ADVENTURE. By far this is the best Marvel action adventure something Favorite scene :Loki and the Hulk. \\"Puny God\\". thump thump thump!
140006922X|5.0|While I don't agree with every conclusion of Aslan's, this comprehensive scholarly book addresses the culture and society of Jesus' life and times and makes it accessible to the layperson.  I heartily recommend it.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|Great.  New initially....Watched it one time and it works great.  I will probably sell it now.  It is in still new condition except I watched it one time.<br /><br />It arrived fast and was exactly at stated...<br /><br />Dr. Suz
B009JBZH54|5.0|Suspenso, action son los elementos mas primordiales en este paquete de The dark Knight Trilogy. Deseo mas peliculas de este Heroe imaginario
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A good challenge.  Wish some of the number and color solutions wold stay up longer so making notes would not be necessary.  Waiting for more, but now  I have to get some work done.
0783240287|4.0|Bring this superb broadway hit from VHS to DVD was done seamlessly. Excellent introduction to Broadway fans and newcomers alike.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because without spending real money you have to wait to get tokens.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|Tons of gore such a homage to so many B movies in an A movie budget .. Has many similarities to the original but... It's not like a remake... Loved this movie ... Did not get a chance. To see it in the theater but I did pick up a copy from amazon on release date... So happy with arrival time. Love the original flavor in the entirely new movie .. Had a ball trying to pick out everything that was in both movies. Obscure and obvious ... If you like Sam raimi if you like horror movies this is a must have for any movies collection!
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|Beautiful, descriptive writing that makes you feel like you are on the prairie in Canada.  The characters will stay with you long after the end of the book.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My micro USB wire works perfect, to charge my Kindle Fire, No problems at ALL. I love mine, it charges in less than 3 hrs!
B008JFUR10|5.0|Movie In general was awesome I went to see it two times never have I done this says it all when ur willing to pay 36 dollar to sit a amc theatre to watch movie you've seen
B00B7Y0206|5.0|The app for YouTube is Wonderful I watch Lots of Camaro and Nature videos. In fact, I am about to look at some videos right now!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love minecraft so I made 15 castles and a tunnel over a month. It is amazing and should definitely be bought
B004GYY714|5.0|This is my favorite App, it allows me to listen to music from All Over the World!!!! Everyone should install this!!!
B0058OUJA4|1.0|DO NOT WASTE 3 BUCKS ON THIS GAME! I was  lucky and got it as the free app of the day but it still sucks!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I Love this app, can make lists to go to the store, or notes to remember things. Love it, When i go shopping for Groceries, this helps me remember what to buy,
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Pretty good and fun for free it is good I think so yes I do now think so good and fun
B000VWYNOG|4.0|Truth be known I got this CD for wifey who is the real fan. I found the first two songs when he sang with the group &#34;Them&#34; to be my favorite. Towards the end of the CD it drifted into what to me were not hits but more filler. Great Album I am sure if you are really a Van Morrison fan
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|Trying the concepts and recipes presented.  This seems like an approach that makes sense and might actually work...and it's easy!
B00007KWHG|5.0|After seeing &#34;Jersey Boys&#34; in VeagsI ordered this CD and the soundtrack from the play. Listening to the original sounds was to me the way to go. It was all about the sound, the voices, and timing. The support music had so much to do with it also. I grew up listening to the group so my bias is obvious. Original is always better in this case. Every song is wonderful.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Historical context is SO important! These were bloody, violent times, in which Jesus lived and worked. Aslan shows the life of Jesus, the man--how he lived, what he did, etc. He also shows how, and suggests why, the early founders of Christianity deconstructed and reconstructed Jesus' legacy, how they used \\"Jesus the man\\" to create \\"Jesus the Christ.\\" For some this will surely make for painful reading, but that might make it all the more important to study this work. The end result is a greater understanding of and appreciation for Jesus' life.<br /><br />The text is somewhat repetitive, as various bits of the history appear in more than one chapter. However, this is because they are used to make different points. This is a solid piece of scholarship, with extensive end-notes for those who desire more detail and documentation (although on the Kindle, tying notes to specific points in the text requires a skill I don't possess). At the same time, the book is quite accessible to the lay reader.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|The app did not work...It did not open any doors or allow me to do anything at all...think there must be quite a few bugs still in it.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Real American hero and you get an idea of what it takes to be a seal. I thought my basic training was tough but it club med compared to what these guys are put through
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|The imagery is somewhat captivating, but the story is thin, and the characters are totally uninteresting.  I never felt any sympathy for any of the characters - it all just relies on special effects.  It is far short of good sci fi movies, and it will be forgotten quickly.  I'm surprised Morgan Freeman signed up for such a weak movie.
B00992CF6W|1.0|It's exactly like the real thing but you cant blow up tnt in creative mode<br />Oh and I think it's a stupid piece of crap because minecraft is just a way to suck kids in to a game and its just plan overrated cause in retrospect all you do is build and destroy<br />END OF STORY<br />Don't get the game it will suck you in and you will never stop waning to play it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is great. It is soo addicting. I would recommend it to anyone any age. easy enough for a kid but challenging enough for a grown up. no glitches or errors so far.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Everything one expects from the Brits: great actors, great story, beautiful costumes and locations. For anyone who loves period dramas.
B009AY04A8|5.0|This is a fun hidden object game done well. Clicking on something with my finger goes well and the object I'm trying to press gets pressed.
0240815807|5.0|First, let me say that I definitely fall under the budget, small home-studio category, which this book particularly caters to. And after reading only 47 pages, I decided I had read enough to be able to write this review. I have spent many hours reading audio forums, and I 'knew' what I was supposed to have in regards to audio monitoring equipment and acoustic treatments. However, Mike Senior finally 'showed' me, unlike anything else I've ever really read, just why they are so important. Previously, I'd always put off these ideas because of the money, and figured I'd be able to work around the issues. After reading just the first chapter, I can already say I've purchased a few items to improve my room treatment, and will be tweeking my room layout to improve the listening experience. All these things were suggested by this book, and upon realizing the difference they made, I am blown away by how terrible my sound was without even knowing it.<br /><br />Second, this book dumb down everything (to an extent) so that you can figure out easily what he is trying to explain. You do need a bit of a background in audio, so if you are trying to figure out why there are waves in sound still, this is not the book for you. But as long as you have the basics, everything else in this book is attainable.<br /><br />Lastly, being only 47 pages in (I know, maybe I'm not very trustworthy source...?) but I am having a hard time not skipping ahead pages just too see all the goodies that I have to look forward to. When other reviewers say every page is filled with useful information, they are not exaggerating. So if you are thinking about getting serious about audio mixing, and have been sort of 'blehing' it in the past like me, this book will certainly help you move to the next level.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I can download anything I want from YouTube with ease. Never a problem. Works well with my Kindle Fire HD tablet.<br />And it was free.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent  and riveting. Could not put it down. My husband was jealous. I love the ending. I can't wait to see the movie to give life to the vivid characters.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I have and receive PDF files from time to time and this is a great help.<br />Opens files up with no problem. Recommend if PDF files are in your life.<br />Works well on my Kindle Fire HD.
B00E0S52K6|5.0|This album was released on Buddy's 77nth birthday (July 30th, 1936). I love guitar and love the blues and Buddy Guy has always been able to cure my hunger. Like Melvin Taylor, BB King, Muddy Waters, Eric Clapton, SRV just to name a few. This album is really good, most definitely worth the purchase. Enjoy.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Once you pick it up, you can't put it down. The story has a great twist that keeps you wanting for more.
B001BC2ZS6|4.0|I wish that the book didn't end like that……… that was like the worst ending ever! There should've been more to it…
B009WUAK2M|5.0|This one is much more entertaining and has more believable action than the first one. The pace was good and never faltering. I could sit through the full movie without taking a break due to boredom.
0399159347|2.0|Just so predictable I have difficulty seeing how it made the best seller lists.  And an Amazon Best of the Month?  Come on. Definitely summer light reading.
140006922X|5.0|wonderful read, couldn't put it down, easy to follow, really enjoyed it reading into the wee hours of the morning on several occasions, a must have in any library!
B00338QENI|5.0|The author nicely combines the personal story of Henrietta and her family with the historical events leading to development of regulatory oversight of human subject research. The author's research is as impressive as her perseverance in getting the facts. A must read for researchers, IRB members, and anyone wanting insight into the exploitation of African Americans by the medical community from a human and humane perspective.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Keeps you guessing  until the end. Very good. Characters well defined. Demonstrates the love of parents for a child and the length one goes to protect one's family
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is awesome I would like if everyone would get this book it is awesome and I am a happy boy now
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great free app! The money comes into play after you use up your hints. The beginning levels are quite easy, which the upper levels can be a challenge to get at 100%.
B00EPL4PBK|5.0|While many will complain that this is a departure from the normal A7X it is still a great album. Coming from someone that grew up listening to Metallica, Pantera, Black Sabbath, MegaDeath, etc it is reminiscent of the Heavy Metal I grew up listening to and loved. The riffs are heavy and aggressive and the solos while generally brief are amazing as usual. Overall, I think it is great to see a band continue to grow and bring new things to the table. If they released the same thing over and over people would get bored. I highly recommend you give this a chance with an open mind, after listening to it through you will recognize that while it is different it is still a great listen.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Tv gets no better than Suits. I look forward to every weekly episode without fail and love all the character development
B004W2UBYW|5.0|A thorough recounting of a very interesting life. What a guy he was. Strange, yet successful.  I have to believe he accelerated the wave of meaningful consumer electronics by years...maybe decades. It was interesting to learn his story.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Such a haunting book. I would definitely recommend it! It strongly shows how the war affected the German population, which is rare.
0802473164|4.0|Some things are corny, but I understand the jist of it. I like how Chapman has categorized 5 different values. I think though not everyone will align with only one, but perhaps a blending.
B004T4LUPW|1.0|Have been charged for this item, but it has not yet arrived on my kindle. It is now 3 hours since I 'bought' it, but still no app. I have received an email saying that the purchase went through.<br /> What do you recommend??
0802473156|5.0|At first I thought some examples were corny, but nonetheless, I understand the purpose. When I started to think in terms of Chapman's love languages I started to understand rifts in my own marriage. It's true, we both have different values and needs in terms of what makes us feel secure.
B0025KVLS8|1.0|Okay, the music is on this disc but because of some weird electronic filter it can only be played on an old-fashioned CD player, not on a computer's CD-ROM drive. The advert didn't tell this, so I have wasted my money, because I really no longer have a CD player. Does anyone still buy such antics?
030758836X|5.0|i never read mysteries. I had no idea what it was about. The title was given out for a book club. I've since told many people about the book and each one came back with either intense discussion, and / or a two-thumbs up.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Great insight and great take aways. Our services are our product and there is no reason we can't streamline and deliver on the same level a manufacturing plant does. I'll be recommending this book for years to come.
0062502182|5.0|I'm still not sure about one phrase - turn into the wind.<br />The story is about empowerment a journey, mistakes, trust in where you take yourself, or rather make sure you have the skills to survive.
B00CL8D83U|4.0|Electric is an excellent dance/work out cd. I gave it 4 out if 5 stars because a few songs were not great but most were fantastic! So happy I bought this for my son and ended up liking it more than he did!
1439170045|5.0|thank you Lisa for writing this book.  It's a depressing topic but very informative. I'm debating having myself tested for early signs.
B00DU74U74|5.0|I really enjoyed this book...started slowly but by half way through I couldn't put it down. So much for sleep.....
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a great game and it has great graphics. I know 7 dollars is a lot of money, but it is definitely worth it!!!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Dudes this is the best never thought theyed make a game like this awsome graphics and all my family loves hope u enjoy
1476717567|5.0|Just a great read, fast, unusual turns in the plot, surprises.  Also, technically factual.  Not a lot of the CSI high tech stuff that no forensic department could afford. Practical police, forensic work.  Just enough Ryan to keep things interesting.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a great game and very, very addictive. I would definitely recommend this game to a friend!  I have it on my kindle and my phone. Love it.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|My husband was infatuated with the show when it was produced. He loves watching reruns and will enjoy this set
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|Please note that this game is so awesome.I think it Deserves a good reward.I just need more mobs that's all.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Excellent show. My husband and I watch a lot of sci-fi shows and movies and have purchased the ones that matter
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Wow, can't wait to start the next book!<br />I would recommend this book highly.<br />Explains so much.<br />I have enjoyed the tv series and can't<br />wait for the new season!!!
0440246318|5.0|husband is thoroughly enjoying his new reacher novel. Whenever I see new one published I purchase it right away for him.
0321885112|5.0|This book is a great starter to think and practice other ways of keeping notes in a multitude of settings. I am starting my doctorate this summer and was looking for different ways to take notes in a seminar setting. I also work in a healthcare setting and spend a lot of time explaining processes, treatments,etc to patients and found myself resorting to pen a paper (often the same exam table paper the patient sits on) to do so. I am by no means good at drawing pictures, but got many great pointers in this book together started with outlines and individual cartoon-style representations of the ideas presented. The book also guided me into summarizing notes in pictures and diagrams rather than the standard information dense outlines. Less writing anymore focusing on the concepts won me over after my first read from cover to cover, now I just need to give my drawing more practice. The author also guided me to other sources, examples of how to use sketchnotes by other writers, websites and other books on the subject, not to mention the video with great additional materials.<br />If you are taking lots of notes in the classroom, office, at meetings or conferences, this book can help you get more out of it.
1250004349|5.0|Unbelievable, that the cruelty of the world at that time. You can't imagine the horror of what these people endured.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This novel gives a glimpse into another culture's parental sacrifices, decisions made for the love and survival of children, as well as the survival of adults, and loyalty and love between siblings, in a setting of harsh terrain and poverty.  The story of how one child's fate largely differs from another's, the fairness, the fallout and acceptance of it makes this a captivating novel, at once heartbreaking yet beautiful.  Kudos to Khaled Hosseini for giving another gift to readers.  I recommend this book as a life comparison to anyone who thinks they have it rough.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|THIS IS MY FAVORITE !! IT PUTS ME TO SLEEP EVERY NIGHT -- I WILL SAY IT DRAINS THE BATTERY HOWEVER I HAVE MY KINDLE PLUGGED IN SO WHO CARES .. I LOVE IT
0525952926|5.0|Fall of Giants, the first book of Follet's trilogy was extremely well done interspersing a fictional story with historical fact.  Winter of the World picks up where Fall of Giants concluded and again an absorbing, enjoyable read.
B007MC0IAG|4.0|A very easy to read explanation of just about everything, which also elegantly punches huge holes in superstition as it goes.
B00DW2PDH8|4.0|I have to admit, I spent a good portion of the beginning of this book confused.  At the same time, I was completely compelled to continue reading to figure out what was going on.  I had so many different questions I hoped for answers to, and although not all questions were answered, this book is a great start to the series.  It really sets the scene for a terrifying series.<br /><br />I never felt very connected to Delicate Rose, but at the same time, I wanted to help protect her.  It was an intriguing experience for me.  Normally when I'm not able to connect to a character I dislike the book, but in this case, I feel that my lack of attachment to her as a person added to the mystery of who she is and who's searching for her.<br /><br />This book is beautifully written.  The terror was palatable just from the insane amount of detail and imagery.  I can't wait to read the next book, and figure out more of what's going on!<br /><br />Note:  I received a free copy of this book for honest review.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Everything has been told about angry birds. But... this app is clear (no ads) and updated till now. Recomended 100%
B001QFZADA|3.0|I bought this \\"...for singles\\" version because I read the original Five Love Languages and even though I appreciated the message and was able to use it myself, I still felt I needed something more appropriate to me since I am not married, so I got this one. I honestly felt I was reading the exact same book only with a few new stores. In addition to the lack of novelty, too many of the anecdotes were just not relatable (what about people who don't live close to family members whose primary love language is physical touch or acts of service?) and there was too much focus on opposite-sex dating and marriage. It was as though that was the only thing that defined a single person. Now, I realize the point is to take the message and find a way to use it in your own relationships, but a little guidance would have been appreciated for folks who are just single. The two major reasons I bought this book were, first, to learn about myself, and, second, to learn more about how to better my relationship with (nonromantic) friends - of both sexes - and not necessarily about dating or marriage prospects. I'm not sure I got what I was looking for directly although I can adapt what I read to fit these other relationships.<br />Overall, great premise and I'm sure it's going to help all my relationships, just have to do a bit of work myself.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|This app is one of \\"have to\\" on your device. No ads, full of fire. I'll never regret to have this jewel
B007KDFWRG|5.0|I found the TTB by accident on Amazon a couple weeks ago. I researched them and found their live album, which is incredible.  The feel, vibe, and sound quality are awesome.  Love this band, and the production.  Best part is buying the CD and getting auto-rip from Amazon for the MP3.  CD quality always beats out MP3 compression.  Amazon gives you the best of both; quality and convenience.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It puts me in the mindset of SimCity Social. And since that game was discontinued. This game suits me fancy just fine. It's a great city building game. And u don't have to spend any real money to progress. It's awesome.
B000028U0Y|5.0|If you aren't much of Cash fan, or don't know much about him, this recording is a great place to start.  It got me interested in Cash, and of all the recordings I have listened to, this live recording at Folsom, along with the one done at San Quentin, I would rank among his best.  The raw music, and the roused up prisoners, make for a great time.  It's nice to play for a captive audience (pun intended), but these guys really do appreciate the simple fact Cash came to them.  Overall, a great listen, and I highly recommend.
B008BTC5E6|4.0|Makes you realize how much of endurance is mind over matter.  Interesting recipes as well, will have to try some if them.  May even consider running an ultra at some point !
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|I just discovered the Tedeschi Trucks Band wandering around on Amazon, but after the listen I bought this CD and their live album.  One aspect about purchasing with Amazon is getting the CD AND the auto-rip for the MP3.  No matter what they say, you can't beat the quality of a CD, so it's worth having it around for future use, or to play in the car for best quality.
B00AA03D18|5.0|The story laid out in this book is one that is so moving it's almost unbelievable.  As a devout Christian, I've never doubted the existence of eternal life, however even a non believer will have to stop and think about Heaven and what getting there entails.  I can highly recommend this book for anyone, Christian or not.  It's a very spiritual experience.
B0093X80VQ|5.0|This book is so silly. I liked the part about minus- land the best.  I think everybody should read this book because everybody will like it.  If you read this book you might want to read it again. (By Tomas age 5)
0553584537|5.0|Alone is a very enjoyable crime thriller in the best tradition of Lisa Gardner's talented and engaging style.  Highly recommended!
B009POCG2C|5.0|Nice to see a baseball movie that a woman can enjoy. A good father and daughter relationship movie. Good for the whole family.
B007FROH4G|5.0|Having recently finished studying psychology myself, I found the authors writing style to be eerily familiar to the many academic texts I have been subjected to for the last 6 years. This was off putting to begin with but I pushed on as I was quickly caught up in the story. By the end of the book the style of writing seemed to have settled in to a better flow and feel, as if the author had found her rhythm. I would definitely read another book by this author. Loved the storyline, loved the characters. It was really hard to finish this book, as I wanted to remain in the characters lives to see what developed next.
B004P8A7J2|2.0|Dont know who would give money for this move made. Of all the stories to be told they decided this one was it????
0399255370|5.0|My 5 year old and I love this book!<br />So creative and funny!<br />Going to start giving this as gifts to his friends instead of toys.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love it its so addictive and amazing graphics I'm so addicted to it :) its such a good game. I recommend it to people who love iron man or just everyone I guess
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game for everyone PLUS it's free!!! Definitely a game worth getting :) I loved it so much I got the rest of my family to get it too :)
160309007X|4.0|Foolish questions....<br />They do no apply to a comic like this...<br />If you like it, you like it; if you don't...
B009UX2YAC|3.0|My grand children love this game. Thought it taught bad qualities to run from the police. Not a bad game though.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Bakersfield is one Vince's greatest albums to this date.  If you love real country this is the album you must have in your collection!
B008MEM24S|5.0|Requires thought and planning. Not just a mindless game. You really have to think paths and qualities of fluids out.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I watched this on a recommendation and wasn't expecting much at all. I'd heard about the 80s version and thought this would just be another mindless action movie, which is fine. Instead, it was strangely...beautiful. Not only were there rock-your-face-off action sequences, and a genuinely sinister villain, but the characters and cinematography really drew me in. You'd think that not seeing Dredd's face ever would make it hard to relate to him but somehow Karl Urban manages to imbue him with humanity. And Anderson is an awesome character who is able to hold her own, be sympathetic, and be realistic all at once. I can see how some people would think this movie has no plot or is too slow, but I was really into it. It just felt like the filmmakers and actors cared about the project, elevating it above your typical shoot-em-up.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved this 3rd installment of Gideon and Eva's relationship!  Can't hardly wait for the rest of their story. Can't put these books down. Such detail and well written storyline. I have a hard time putting it down. Hurry Sylvia Day and Captivate me!
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|I have to admit, I was a little disappointed to find out that A7X was &#34;moving away&#34; from their signature sound for a little more of a Classic Metal feel. However, after actually hearing the new album, I am convinced it was a great move. It still has the signature sound with more of a Metallica/Sabbath feel to it which blends incredibly well. Definitely a sweet deal on the CD with the &#34;Autorip&#34; promo. I will be listening to this album for years
B00571F26Y|3.0|This book starts out talking about wheat and ends up telling you to eliminate all white stuff as well as limiting fruits. This can get a bit confusing,.  Although it's an interesting read, the Blood Sugar Solution comes up with the same conclusion through a more logical pathway.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|What a blessing to take God's Word with you anywhere.  I love the different versions available. And you Don' have to be online.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|Withings have come up with a great bit of kit here. Does everything that you ask of it and recent updates have made it even better. Very accurate and with a good battery life this product is head an shoulders above the competition. If withings could add some form of alarm function it would make a very good product perfect!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|A coworker suggested that I download this game on my Kindle Fire HD.  I just started playing and I'm addicted.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I'm in my 50's and generally don't like any music made after the 70'a and 80's. This album is an exception. It is great music. Bruno Mars' Unorthodox Jukebox is in league with Fleetwood Mac's Rumours, Steely Dan's Don't Look Back, and Boston's eponymous work.
B004S4YY4C|4.0|As always, Follett does his research, engages the reader and maintains interest to the last page. I always look to follett for for a great read.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|I adore this show from the 80s. It's a classic and created a pop culture phenomena still referenced today! LS
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love having this so no matter what I am on and find if I want to have it with me and I have it boom that is it awesome
B00BIHWVWY|5.0|I love this player. It has almost everything you want and at a low price. I love its interface. Everything is right in front of you.....just touch it. One of the best things is a really nice visualizer. It's pleasantly surprising. It also has a great equalizer...on that does visuals too:)
B002SR2PKG|4.0|As an aspiring author, I have nothing but the deepest respect for the way Stephen King can tell a story. While horror is not my favorite genre, I continue to read King's books because he can write so well. I just love his stories, no matter what they're about. Being able to remember both 1985 and 1958, I could identify with all of his characters, in both phases of their lives. As always, King's ability to help the reader suspend disbelief is the most important aspect of his skill in making a story, such as this one about the multi-dimensional monster in Derry's sewers, come to horrific life.<br /><br />And those of you who, like me, love to discover connections with the Dark Tower multi-verse, you will be delighted with It!<br /><br />The only reason I downgrade this review from five stars to four stars is for the Kindle version. As read on my iPad, I found it had not been edited to the Kindle format. \\"1's\\" were often translated as \\"l's\\" or \\"I's\\" and vice versa, often in the middle of words. Letters were often missed, or an extra space would be added before a closing quotation mark. As a result, the closing quote would often appear as an abandoned orphan on a separate line of text. While these flaws don't bother me when I have not paid anything, or up to $0.99 for an e-book, it bugs the hell out of me when I paid almost $10.00 for a Stephen King Kindle version. Considering the fact that a King book is published in millions of copies, the purchase of a hard-copy results in something one can't resale easily, and the paperbacks (for those of us who can remember 1958) have too small print to read anymore. You do the math. That means we end up buying used hard covers ... Take note, Mr. King. We love you. We'd like to make sure you get your slice of the pie. You deserve it. Make sure your editors edit your Kindle versions, so your Older Constant Readers can continue to Constantly Read!!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|better than 100 floor or the others to me. this one actually makes since. I like it and my God daughter likes it as well. I do not like this 20 word min review thing. I should be able to say as little as I want thanks.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Well when I first got the game I goofed around with it and had some fun. Then I believe about month and half ago my nephew deleted it from my phone, that was a bummer cause I'd gotten a ways in the game not to mention that I'd also had spent a little for extra cash on the game so I could buy the cool stuff that you either had to put Sirius game time to achieve or out right buy with debit. Well any rate I've got the game back on my kindle and look forward to playing more iron man.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Game Is Fun For Awhile Then Just When You Get Into It, It Starts Asking For Money To Continue To Play......
B0058OUJA4|4.0|I love  this puzzle game, it's fun and challenging. With every new level there I  a new challenge to face. It's not the best that's why I put 4 stars but I am addicted for sure
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book was a great insight into the sacrifices made and dangers faced by snipers during the devastating war in Iraq. What makes the book even more interesting is that we learn about the extremely important and dangerous sniper job from the most lethal American sniper: Chris Kyle.
B004A6MJNQ|5.0|I have loved this movie ever since I saw it for the first time. It is by far my favorite movie.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I could watch this movie time and time again.  it is hysterical.  If you are looking for a laugh with the ladies, this will fit the bill.
1400043662|5.0|This book keeps your interest the entire time!  This is a fantastic Author that knows how to spin each situation to make it interesting to the readers.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Couldn't put it down, we'll written and enthralling. Loved it and looking forward to buying another of Emma's books soon.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|This was my first time ever reading this kinda comic and its really good and I liked it. I would say get it.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Has a great deal of info, but updated version is much harder to read.  Old version had nice, clear simple pictures, easy too read quickly.  Radar doesn't seem as clear.  Loads much slower.  For me, the update was not a good thing.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|...for any self-professed Christian. There are many other books on Christian history out there (and Aslan cites them extensively), this book sets the mark for being accessible to the general reader.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Not the usual Bond film. After the usual opening Bond action, the film is long, chatty and dull. Better luck next time.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|This book is not one of his best, but it kept my attention. It jus wasn't one of those books I couldn't put down.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|My post title sums it up. Learned negative quality about Amazon video rental: I was under the impression that once you started watching a paid rental movie you had 2 hrs to complete viewing it. Once the rental expires, even if you are halfway through it, the video shuts off. They need to explain that more clearly in their policies. I missed the last 5 minutes of the movie which was pretty sucky (maybe the last 5 minutes were excellent and made up for the previous 120)
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|It is definitely a breath of fresh air in a classic that will endure the test of time as long as we have brilliant minds to carry on the legacy to new generations. I loved the first and even more this one. Please keep them coming. The cast has done a FANTASTIC job stepping into legends shoes and yet adding so much to their character and so has the director pushed the boundaries of creation to entertain the old and new. Star Trek Forever.
B008602KQI|5.0|I read and loved all the books, and this movie version  certainly did not disappoint. Outstanding portrayals of all characters and clarified some questions I had in the book. Well worth viewing.
B00DHHWYAW|1.0|Add miscasting, anachronistic music, overcrowded overdone sets,irrelevant sprinkling of images to dilute a scene,stir well in a cinematic blender, and you have this movie.  You have to hand it to Hollywood, when they do an overhyped underperforming remake, they know what they are doing.  This is somewhat not the definitive Gatsby. Visit the Redford version, if for nothing else but the clothes.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|I'm rating this book in comparison to Sparks' other works.  It was okay. If you really like his work, I recommend it.  However, if your new to him as an author you can find a number of novels that are better.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Stunning cinematography and well executed plot - a mood piece that gets under your skin. Would it be as good without the big-name actors? I think so.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is definitely a different kind of game I usually play but I'm glad I did! Has so many things to do and it keeps u interested all the way! I'm sold and think everyone should definitely give it a try!
B003XE3HA0|2.0|I own 20+ pairs of Crocs, this does not include the many pairs I worn out.  Never have I had an issue with crocs.  Until the sling Back on this Croc snapped  in half the third day i wore them. I have contacted the seller for return.<br /><br />Be aware that this seller send products through US (registered) postal service, so delivery will be a pain if you won't be home to receive the package. I own three pairs of this croc in different colors.<br /><br />I have planters fasciitis, so shoe purchases center on proper support.  I used to wear fin comfort at 300-450 bucks a pair. After losing 100 pounds I found I could wear the much cheaper  and more styling Crocs.  I love my Crocs, love even more that they are coming out with cute styles.  But I did not like my experience with this seller and the pair I ordered from them.<br /><br />I will update when I find out how easily they will accept my return.
B002XTBEDI|3.0|I didn't like that some people who were important in the original simply disappeared. I thought it was important to have them back in the sequel. I enjoyed watching the women in town trying to rule in all things at that time! It was a bit unrealistic but fun to watch. You should get ready for disappointment.
B007C52NY2|3.0|Great books, page turners for sure.. No slip case as advertised bad for me as this was a gift. Fast ship.
