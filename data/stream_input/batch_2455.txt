B009NY43NY|5.0|I don't know what all the uproar was about, I feel the final Sookie Stackhouse story ended just fine. I'm sad the series is over, but am very pleased with how it all turned out.
B008BU75IQ|2.0|Ok...so I understand the plot; it's easy enough to follow...albeit unrealistic at times...only to have no closure.  The fate of the villains is not addressed and the story is left up in the air.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|My wife and I are huge trekkies and when voyager came out we could not get it where we lived.  It is awesome and we are loving every episode.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Whatever Josh Groban touches he turns it into gold; this beautiful voice in various combinations with the instruments of the orchestra and choir; this man is a genius and a humble and kind one at that. His music touches your soul over and over again.<br />Thank you Josh !
0786956291|4.0|Outstanding...  very easily run your first game...<br />recommend it to anyone interested in running a D&D 4e game for the first time.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Streisand's choice of singing partners is remarkable and with each one she lays another accent. Beautiful and heartwarming at the same time.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|I was disappointed in so many ways. Russel Crowe was all wrong. He quite simply can't sing and never should have been cast in the role. Hugh Jackman was also a weak singer but at least the acting was better, which can't be said for the others. Amanda Seyfried's thin reedy voice was unpleasant and was overwhelmed by the other singers especially in the trios and quartettes.<br />The added material had both pros and cons. It helped to make the story flow more logically, which was probebly a help to those not smart enough to fill in some of the blanks with their imagination. They did, howver add so much time to the story that it was tedius. The added music was in the style of the original, but again was not a positive thing because the music also then became boring and tedius.<br />The director completely missed the point of an opera. There is no great need for verisimilitude. He should have presented a show well sung and acted.<br />Maybe someone will do the film again the right way.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Micheal Bublés voice is very similar to Sinatras but also unique. His songs, covers or not, sweep you off your feet and make you dance. or make you hold on to one another in a romantic slow. I hope he stays for a long long time!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is an exciting 'who done it' for most of the book, then a good chiller thriller but the ending seemed too abrupt.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This was full of action, excitement, different stories that intertwine to one incredible movie! I highly recommend to all. Men, women, & children alike. You'll love it!!!
B0084670FU|4.0|This movie kept us on the edge of our seats. It had a lot of twists and turns. Several stories within one larger story....unique.
B009LGO88E|5.0|After waiting a little while for this to arrive from Japan, I was very pleased with the outcome. Kingdom Hearts DD works amazing as does Resident Evil. They feel like new games now!  The added grips that the base adds to the system are great for larger hands like mine. I just wish there was an open space to remove the stylus as it does get trapped under the system when you put this on. I assumed this add on used the systems power but it comes with a AAA battery and connects via the IR port which is quite odd but still unobtrusive. Well done Nintendo, now why didn't you think of this BEFORE you made the system?  :)
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|This app really saves time compared to bringing up something similar on the computer. It does most of what I would like to do on a business site.
B009NY43NY|4.0|This was a great way to end the series. With Sookie in trouble, all the important people from her past come to help her! Nice way to get all characters into the final book. Was sad for the ending I had hoped see would end up differently, but very good book. Sookie will be missed!!!
B004W1GCNC|4.0|The characters & the storyline are interesting. The historical setting is also a positive. The actors are great and the casting perfect.
193700788X|1.0|I started the book.  Got 80 pages into it and started to get nervous by how badly put together the storyline seemed and decided to check out reviews on Amazon to see what other readers were feeling.  I've now decided I'm not going to finish the book.  If ever there was a book to be rewritten by fans, this is the one.  Fan fiction is the only way we re going to find true resolution with this series.  I'm dying for Eric to crawl back into Sookies bed and claim her once and for all! Unite my friends, and write!
B008G59IBI|5.0|kinda sad that rock is really out of the mainstream but nothing can stop me from listening to this album this album is the best from the three got good melody and good lyrics,,nice job Green Day,
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Entertaining enough but makes you stop and constantly asks you for money or Facebook link. After playing eight times you have to stop for a while.<br /><br />Helps to waste a few minutes at a time though.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely love it.  The characters are so easy to attach to that i think of them all as my friends!
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|this book has to be one of my favourite, cassandra clare as the author was just brilliant. the book was quick, original, charming, hilarious, lovable and a real page turner. I coul not ask for more in a book. I saw no fault in it at all and the story line was fantastic and gripping, the characters are all solidly built and i felt intensly connected to them from the very first pagetak advantage of this awesomely written book and ignore the negative criticsthat ae jut too fussy to enjoy somethin good. these days you just dont find novels these days like it.
B004ZMWUCU|1.0|This was a meaningless book about small things.  Might as well write about the mole on someones face or a scratch on your leg.
B00BCX2F66|3.0|I really REALLY wanted to love this case as much as I do the phone its supposed to protect but its more of a love/hate relationship<br /><br />From a cosmetic standpoint, it compliments the phone well. I like the look and feel of it<br /><br />from a functionality standpoint...not so much..Yeah the kickstand feature works just fine, but as so many others posted, the fit is pretty poor. There is no snapping to keep it secure, it just sort of fits, and I can easily push it out with minimal effort. Very poor design flaw for an OEM product. I couldnt really recommend this product to anyone who is serious about needing good protection from falls.
193700788X|5.0|I enjoyed it greatly. I laughed, and cried, and smiled a lot. I'll miss Sookie, but this was a satisfying ending to a fabulous series.
B001NZP9JS|5.0|good rap,im from the old school and red man and method man has been putting it down for years,this is a good cd,a must have for anybodys collection that love real rap.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Romola Garai is a favorite and this is a great example of her work. Jonny Lee Miller is a great Knightley--better IMHO than Jeremy Northam.  For example, he does the scene where he rebukes Emma on Box Hill with barely controlled rage--just as it should be, if he's jealous of Emma's apparent relationship with Frank Churchill as well as offended by her treatment of Miss Bates.
B0029Q8C62|5.0|this is real good rap,im from the old school and i grew up listening to red man and method man and they have good beats and nice rap flow.
B0029Z7Y2G|5.0|got this free movie and it was great to see how they made the movies and animation to make the were wolves come to life and battle the vampires.  WATCH IT.
B003Y5H5B0|4.0|I really liked the comedy and the acting.  I love Channing Tatum.  The move would have been rated higher if it weren't for all the foul language.  It was embarassing to listen to.  However, if you don't mind &#34;F&#34; every other word, the movie was quite good.
B00BT0ZS52|4.0|\\"Cloud Atlas\\" is perfect for the hand-held device. You can watch a few minutes just to appreciate the production value of each of the film's six storylines, the plot of each scene and the tour de force acting of each of its stars, or you can watch it whole or in large segments as you would watch any movie for the overall effect. Beyond marveling at the versitility of the actors you can note the integrity of each story, which could work as its own movie in its own genre. \\"Cloud Atlas\\" works in the portable medium too because of the IMDB feature which identifies each star with his or her character in each segment in a running reference. Also, I like the extra features which follow the movie, putting the intentions of the filmmakers into perspective. I will keep \\"Cloud Atlas\\" in the Cloud to view for years to come.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|I'm a big fan of musicals, especially dance movies.  The story line in this is typical cliche, but the dancing more than makes up for it.  It's a very exciting movie with really great dance numbers, and lots of them.
B005USZYDU|5.0|This book is a great read because the story line is interesting yet uncomplicated.  I found it very entertaining and believable.  John Grisham has done it again!
B0032JTV6U|4.0|I got hooked on Glee mid way through the second season, so I was already in love with it when I went back and picked up this first season.  They have improved greatly since the first few shows. Now that I'm officially hooked on Glee, however, I just had to see the first season.  These kids are soooo talented!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I just recently watched the movie and had to read the book.  There weren't any  disappointments.  Can't wait to start reading catching fire.
B007T99ENE|5.0|Sweet Tooth is the 14th book by British author, Ian McEwan. Serena Frome's story is narrated in detail essentially from the time she first gets involved with the man who will usher her into a position in MI5, in the early 70's Britain. Serena is a compulsive reader of fiction and her first \\"secret mission\\" is to cultivate promising young author, Tom Haley. Their mutual attraction ensures they step beyond the boundaries set by her superiors, and before long, things start to unravel. While a working knowledge of British politics of the seventies plays would enhance the enjoyment of this novel, it is not requisite. McEwan presents the reader with a delicious irony when Serena tells us she distrusts any kind of fictional trick, something of which McEwan is a master. Once again, he fools the reader but, whereas I felt cheated by it in Atonement, this time I revelled in it. The end has the reader wondering: just whose words are we actually reading? The answer is very simple: those of a brilliant novelist.
B00AJAFNIA|4.0|So glad to have a fun and addictive free app of the day without those annoying in app purchases. I would gladly pay the small normal cost for this game and look forward to trying other games by Liquid Entertainment. Not sure if there is snooping going on as other reviews gave stated but i am running this on a galaxy tab used onky for fun. No problems to report.
B007I6FNJW|5.0|The original &#34;The King and I&#34; is good, this take on the story is great.  Love it and was very happy with the product and the seller.
1439153663|5.0|This was a great book! I could not put it down....It was my book club pick and at first I did not think I would like it boy was I pleasantly surprised..
B00006LFGD|5.0|If you had 10 stars this would get it. Stellar performances by  everyone  she  sings with. This is my [road trip] music.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|WHOA&#62; is this a cooler or what? Blows directly onto CPU, plugs into MOBO power, which might be controllable thru software. Check the specs on MBO mfg...The copper pipes and fins dissipate heat very well, and not too noisy, enclosed in the Box. It does seem a bit heavy for some LOW end MBO, but if you are careful to get it installed securely, it WILL surely keep the heat off the CPU. Cooler Master makes great products, and has been at it a long time. NO, I don't work for them, never have. Just call  it as I see it. This unit is made for OLDER MOBO specs, so check out the specs. I got it for a 775, dual core INTEL cpu. Does the job.
B0091REZMW|2.0|Good but easy it was fun at first but then you have to pay and eventually it gets boring but it is a good quality app.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|it is an awesome game. you can fly and shoot beams out of his hands. the gaame is not dad for kid at all
B009NY43NY|3.0|This is a reposting of my original review I removed three years ago after getting so much hate for it. Seems as if there has been enough time to re-post.<br /><br />LOTS of ends being tied up here. It seemed as if every slimy douche who ever had a problem with Sookie slithered out from their prospective rock and took aim. Overkill? You betcha! The beginning POV’s left me guessing who these people were and were not in keeping with the usual outline of this series. I wanted more time being spent on a satisfying conversation between Eric and Sookie. I wanted an understandable finality to it. Not a slamming door that just shows immaturity. How many books did Bill and Sookie get to hash things out? Come on. It all just felt rushed and thrown together. Too much time spent reminding us who everyone was. What people did, trips to the market, gardening and house cleaning. The hook up with Sam wasn’t romantic to me. I actually rolled my eyes at the conversation right after. It seemed forced and I think more time setting that connection up would have served the overall ending much better.<br /><br />I’ll be honest, for me, DEA should have been a love letter to the fans. A thank you if you will for allowing CH to have this amazing journey. It may sound presumptuous of me to expect CH to have these feeling just because I want her to but that’s how I feel. I have no issue with who Sookie ended up with. I get it. I understand the idea of it. The one who was always there. The best friend overlooked. It’s a storyline that has been a favorite in movies and books for eons. I get that CH has the right to choose who her characters end up with, however, that wasn’t the even a happily ever after for Sookie either. We were left with an “ if it works out okay… if not ok too??” I just don’t get it. Throughout this series it has been a” love can concur all” mentality. Doesn’t matter if you are human, Vamp or shifter right is right with some good Christian attitude thrown in. Although the Christian attitude tended to be a bit random.<br /><br />I said it in my review of the last book and I will say it again. It just seems tired. CH was over it and was ready to move on. I wish her well and thank her for the ride. It was a wonderful ride and this series will go down as one of my favorites. Thank You, ​CH!rown in.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|good story..a lookk at problems and a city I don't know much about. Last half of the book is laugh out loud funny then tears sad.
B003KRLKHC|5.0|Without giving away the plot twist, this was one of the most well done movies I have seen in a long time.  Denzel Washington did a great job, as he usually does in his acting.  But the surprise of the movie will not be revealed to you until near the very end of the movie.  A great story which is not buried in special effects.
B0049MPHZI|4.0|A very enjoyable book. While perhaps not as clever as his later books, it still captures your imagination with rich imagery and intriguing characters. All in all Alastair Reynolds is a credit to the science fiction genre and I eagerly await the next of his space operas.
B00BESNKB8|4.0|This movie was a well done martial arts movie done in the old Hong Kong martial arts movie style.  The twist in the movie was who the man with the iron fists was, and how he obtained them.  There were some parts of the movie that were a little on the flat side, but all in all it was a very well done movie.  I would recommend it to any who like martial arts action movies.
B00B2G2RG6|2.0|I admit I got hooked and had to watch to the end. But basically I was quite upset...way too much graphic violence. I found myself counting the number of innocent people being killed in each episode. I don't think it was well conceived or written. I like Kevin Bacon but not in this role as a contrived FBI agent with heart trouble. I won't watch if it is back next season with the villain reincarnated and the hero/heroine patched back together with artificial body parts!<br />Ed Baker
B004PAHZMC|5.0|Grandson lives in Japan and he loved his birthday present. His mom loves it too...now he has a place to put his ALL his legos
B005Z28M58|5.0|I have the complete series. Hours and hours of enjoyment. I can watch them over, and over again. All round great series!!!
B007EC27QM|5.0|It's often said &quot;You Get What You Pay For&quot;. In this case, you truly do get your money's worth and a bit more.<br /><br />I have downloaded a number of app's for my Kindle Fire, only to delete them immediately because they were not as good or useful as I expected them to be. This is an app that does what it is supposed to do, and does it well. What more can one ask for?<br /><br />This app doesn't just sit around on my Kindle, it gets used more often than I thought it would.<br />-Iven
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We have enjoyed this show and also have Season 3 movie.  And waiting to get Season 4.  Will there be a Season 5??  We hope so!!
B000YRY8BG|1.0|All the characters are annoying, even our supposed hero, the reporter.  I did not even watch the whole thing.  I only lasted for two hours.  The whole thing moves too slowly.  It has made me rethink buying British discs.  Around New Year's, I tried to watch one called The Hour.  Also slow and awful.  Slow does not mean suspenseful, it just means slow.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Les Miserables was a wonderful show which I saw years ago on Broadway so very glad to have the movie.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|The Borgias is the best show on television.  It show creativity in the drama and in occasional flashes of humor.  All the actors are good.  They could cut down on the graphic sex, though.
030759565X|5.0|I have been subscribed to the Smitten Kitchen blog for a few years now and love her writing style and way of cooking.  I was very pleased with this cook book, and I have made several things contained in the book.  I like her large vegetarian geared section, as well as some phenomenal desserts......  SUCH a fun read.  HIGHLY recommend
B009NY43NY|5.0|This has been one of my favorite series of books and am so sad it's finished!  I really appreciate how Charlaine Harris has ended the series with a feeling of completion without being too predictable.  This last book was full of all sorts of interesting plot twists while still tying up loose ends.  I can't wait for the final companion novel to come out that will explain how all of the characters' lives turned out.
0451232852|5.0|Follet shows again how versatile he is.  This book, (and the second one too) are a combination of historical novel<br />and soap opera....the reader really gets involved with the characters, and the perspective on the times and<br />sociology is fascinating.
B0095VPBFY|5.0|If you are looking to play games without a dedicated graphics card I wouldn't get your hopes up to high. You'll get similar performance to a low end laptop. Games like Sonic Generations and Tomb Raider shows a lot of tearing/lag,
1400069807|2.0|Some what academic and difficult to wade through the first few chapters. As it got anecdotal there seemed to be way to much &#34;SECRET INSIDE INFORMATION&#34; which tended to be very subjective.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Useful tool to have, makes it easy to look up words when you need to.  Eassier then getting the book out or when you can't get the book.
1407109367|5.0|... but it's very entertaining and thought-provoking. You get to love the characters. All the characters. Even the scary, slimy, manipulative President Snow (you have to love a guy with an extravagant fondness for white roses).<br />Of course, you get some favorites along the way and you root for them with so much passion, you'll scare yourself (at least I did).<br />Hadn't seen that coming...<br />Read it, you'll enjoy it even more than the first. And you'll never look at a pearl the same way again...
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This novel will keep your attention and wanting to know more! I would recommend this book to anyone! Now, I can watch the movie!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I'd love to see how he kept all these characters flowing through this series.  Truly didn't believe I would enjoy something from this period, but Mr. Martin has certainly changed my mind.
0817439390|5.0|I am only a couple pages into the book and already understanding and doing more! I am fairly new to photography, so I am not sure how this book would be for advanced photographers, but if you are new and looking for help getting started, buy this book. You won't regret it!
B008602KQI|4.0|Entertaining Sci Fi movie. Jennifer Lawrence  is outstanding in this flick! This was the first movie I have seen her in and she made the movie
1616550414|5.0|My boyfriend is a HUGE fan of the series. I bought it without him realizing for Christmas and when it finally came he couldn't put it down for weeks. It's got wonderful art and fantastic timelines. I highly recommend this as a gift for any fan of the Legend of Zelda series.
B0070DOHQS|4.0|I got this app to control the laptop hooked up to the tv via HDMI. I am able to do on the tv what I would normally do on my laptop from the comfort of my couch.<br /><br />Streaming videos from laptop or the internet. Watching You Tube, or even reading email on a huge screen.<br /><br />I have not tried to retrieve documents away from home, but it should be easy enough.<br /><br />It works well with the Galaxy S3
B003WUYRGI|3.0|Good to have on here for my kids and myself we are not the best speller in the world due to spelling problems
B008XKT9FG|5.0|I rented this just because of who the actors/actresses were.  A very pleasant surprise ! ! ! !  I really liked it a lot.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|The story is amazing and complex......I was captivated! The 'good' characters are wonderful and the bad characters are loathsome!  Have to love a story that takes you on an emotional rollercoaster!!!!!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I have the book and the abridged audiobook. Since there are stories left untold in the audiobook I can still enjoy rereading the book. I love everything about the book and the audiobook. If you enjoy reading stories about a persons experiences at a moment in time you will love this book. There are times I would forget it had not actually happened! It feels so real in so many ways.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a fun game. I really enjoy it, and happy i found something to pull me away from my other favourite game that i can't seem to enjoy on my kindle for some reason. Buy still fun and keeps me playing.
B00540G3G6|5.0|It's great to get to watch such an awesome movie in 3D at home!  I remember having to travel out of town to see it in 3D at the theaters.  Brilliant damn movie!
B003OUXECE|5.0|Rapture is an interesting intellectual thought experiment on what I know to be called 'Humanism'. This utopia has gone sideways. The book follows its creation, height and fall.  It lacks some things that you'd probably find in a real life civilization - like a competent judiciary (even in an unregulated capital economy you'd probably need that to enforce business contracts) - yet as a back story to a fun game, it's more than adequate.<br /><br />Who would expect to find a thought experiment in a companion book to a AAA video game?!<br /><br />Another reviewer or two suggested that this might be a spoiler book. I read the book coincident with playing the game. The book added depth to the game.<br /><br />Congratulations to the author. I wish you well.
0920668372|5.0|Of course this is a wonderful story, so touching and perfect for a mother and son, even when he is 21!
B000HF6XV8|5.0|I loved the book and love this movie (despite the fact that Mary Lennox was blonde and Kate Maberly is not).<br />The acting is wonderful, the scenery is perfect, and the book comes to life. For me, it is like The Great Gatsby,<br />To Kill a Mockingbird, can read or watch repeatedly over time.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent cinematography. Wonderful plot line. Nice correlation with historical events. I am looking forward to season 4. Let's not kill off any more characters.
B002JIEYKS|5.0|What else can you say its Black Sabbaths last album with ozzy the real Sabbath Iommi is great here and butler and ward do fantastic work. it is very different than early Sabbath but great music.
0385523912|5.0|Excelent Book. Presents the lives of ordinary people in North Corea, their struggle, the hunger, the brain washing and the different reactions to it. A true story told in simple words. Shows the reality of living under a totalitarian government without freedom and what happens if one has the opportunity to live differently.
B0091REZMW|3.0|fun hidden objects game the screen is alittle small and dark but fun. would help if you could zoom in and out
0451232852|5.0|I listened to this book on audio, and the narrator needs to be commended for an AMAZING job. Not only was his reading level and enthusiastic throughout, but the wide array of accents he provides (German, American English, Russian, Welsh, British, etc.) is downright stunning. Were he to convincingly portray but one of those accents, it would be impressive, but he does so with all of them, and it really helps to put the listener into the minds and emotions of the characters.<br /><br />As for the plot of this novel, it is staggering in its scope and ambition. Ken Follett knows how to swing for the fences, that's for sure. This becomes a fascinating story about WW1, all the way through its origins and completion, and hints at what is to come in the next book (\\"Winter of the World\\") with some thoughts on prohibition and Adolf Hitler. The story can drag a bit at times, due to the complexities of the politics in play, but I am easily able to overlook this, since the plot is so massive, well planned, and interesting.<br /><br />Personally, I feel that this book cannot hold a candle to Follett's previous historical fiction behemoths, \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"World Without End\\", but that is by no means a criticism. Those are two of the very finest books I've ever read, and among my favorites, so it would be nearly impossible for any book to come close to them. This is still a FIVE STAR novel by any measure. As for readers who are fans of American history or WW1, they will most likely enjoy this book even more than \\"Pillars\\" and \\"World\\". I believe Follett is one of the greatest novelists of our time or any other, and reading his novels is a true privilege.
B005J2UM9S|5.0|The movie is really well made outside of the fact that its highly unlikely someone black would even be part of this let alone do some of the single mission stuff he was told to do(I'm black and yea that would not happen) otherwise culturally I think it was accurate, the cast was very good at each role especially the girl.  She was the most afraid when something happened and the main guy that signed off was always looking for more film even as they delved into more obvious things that made it clear they were no longer just dealing with some comedic paranormal show.  There weren't many scares but the ones they had were genuine.  It wasn't a slasher flick, it wasn't quite psychological thriller because some elements were just too cliche but overall its a good movie and I will probably pay to see the sequel even though I know sequel sucks usually.  The last 20 minutes are the best, it doesn't use anything special.  It simply shows someone desperate.  I like how with the girl they didn't explain why she felt the way she did later on.  It let you make your own conclusions.  The end is good because it ties into the latter half of the movie with regard to another character they know.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|What a wild ride!<br /><br />Loved this twist on a classic tale.  Believable characters, realistic setting...all fantastic!<br /><br />I recommend this to all who enjoy a mystery and invite you to enjoy the ride!
B008GXHOFW|1.0|Worst app ever. I have deleted EVERYTHING off of my Kindle Fire and this stupid game still needs 35 Mb. There's nothing else to delete. What am I supposed to do take my cover off my Kindle? Physically remove my screen? Sand the black off of the skin of the Kindle? As you can see I am not happy at all!
097747609X|3.0|Although the translation is a bit dodgy, it does help to give an insight into his strange ideas and sort of a hint at what was going to happen.  He was definitely a bit out there.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love using this application on my Kindle because I can get a weather forecast for multiple locations with little trouble. Works great and has enough detail to please most any weather enthusiast.
B008VBYN80|2.0|I turned off the notifications 3 times and still I was getting almost 100 of them a day.  Talk about annoying!  I don't think it's necessary to give me the SAME notification 25 times in 1 minute.<br /><br />Exciting feel to the game-play and good use of the combat system.  However the Gameloft and facebook site connections only worked half the time and you will not get far in this game unless you play through Social Networking.<br /><br />The sad thing with this game is there was so much promise to the game.  I would have bought this game for 4.99 had there been no IAPs.  It have time management, RPG and building your own lands in the game, but it's the IAPs for this game that kills it.<br /><br />At the point now in the game that without IAPs I have no other alternative to make IAPs.... so I deleted it.
B008B68IUY|5.0|My daughters are really into Monster High stuff. One of them earned this and she loves it.  You can fit four dolls on to it, it moves easily, and there are seatbelts which help hold the dolls in place (and model safety).  The style and design are well done.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My daughter has been playing this one for a while now and still plays it several times a day.  A lot of content for quests and such in this game... even for free this game is a keeper.  However...<br /><br />*** Caution to Parents *** IAPs are very easy to make in this game and even easier to spend... suggest parental locks.<br /><br />I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this game worked with no problems.
B003O86FMW|5.0|SUZANNE COLLINS IS A GREAT WRITER IVE READ JUST HER FIRST BOOK AND KNEW SHE  WAS GOOD SO OF COURSE I HAD TO READ  THE SECOND SHE PUTS SO MUCH DEPTH AND ALMOST LIKE  ASURPRISE ATTACK  INHER BOOKS ITS WONDERFULL&lt;3!!!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I was a little leery about playing this game let alone downloading it at first.  My thought was, OMG what if they think I'm some kind of nut wanting to do something crazy.... STOP.... This game is NOT like that.  You really do take on the role of bacteria/virus/etc and humans are your hosts.  This game is not a how to.... but more of a CDC what if....<br /><br />I played this game all the way through (except I'm still stuck on the Necroa Virus level - Brutal) and have NOT made any IAPs.  Yes, you can beat this game without making IAPs.  All the cheat levels can be opened up without IAPs - mine are.<br /><br />Search the net if your need some strategy although I'm yet to find one site that went from start to finish for all levels so you might be using 3 or 4 different sites through your game play.<br /><br />I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and had not technical issues with this app.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This alarm clock actually wakes me up!  I now use it everyday and have yet to sleep in!  Fade in works great that way it doesn't scare the crape out of you!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a keeper as a time killer.  You can play this game for a minute, or hours.... that's what makes this game a perfect time killer.  You have a second to kill, or a few hours to pass.<br /><br />Never had to make any IAPs.  Save your Dozer Dollars (DD) from puzzle completions to upgrade your prize sets and you will figure out how to have thousands of coins banked up.  Very addictive.<br /><br />If you get this one for your kids, be absolutely certain you lock your device from unwanted purchases as the DD's are easily spent.<br /><br />I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this game works extremely well with no problems.
B00004R99F|4.0|Goofy is a favoriate Disney character and this movie was very entertaining. Lots of laughs and it was very enjoyable even for adults.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Exactly what you would expect from this game.  Longevity for this game is good as I am still playing it after DLing it a month ago.  The drawback I found in this game is your high score resets every week (same time) to start a new tournament.  That's a real let down when you got a nice score and there is nowhere the game saves your &#34;all time&#34; high score (-1 star for that only bad point).<br /><br />There are IAPs for this game but imho they are not necessary.  Connection made properly and easily to the facebook account if you choose to.<br /><br />I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this game worked with no problems.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow free is a great game. It gives your brain the opportunity to figure out more thing and using your brain helps in this game. It not only a game it's an exercise for your brain. You should play this game it's fun . However you need to limit your time of this game because you can get bad eye sight . Play this game.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Can't give this one enough praise.  It's probable the best table app game I've ever seen.  You get this faint spider-web like symbol while levels are loading - be patient, this games demand on the graphics and RAM are high.  Although short, considering the quality and time and effort that went into the production of this game (which is evident) I had no problem paying 99 cents.<br /><br />Should this app ever be offered as the FAOTD then EVERYONE with a device capable of playing this game should definitely DL it.  There are no IAP requests, and an internet connection is not required to play.<br /><br />I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this game worked very well with no problems other than the load time for the levels.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Held my interest as well as the previous books. I am exhausted from the emotions the author expressed. Excellent book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|SUPER BIG calculator!  What more could a person want to go with their old and aging eyes?  Fat fingers?  No problem.  No internet connection - no problem.  My wife loves this app when shopping.  She said the ability to go back and edit certain entries is awesome and handy.  Personally I just buy what I want and they tell me what to pay.... Could explain why I'm not allow a check-book LOL.<br /><br />I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this app worked with no problems.  No IAP offers found so far.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it had changes from the computer version but it is great.I play with my friends and we have a good time that is y I bout the game
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Does not work well through facebook.  IAPs a must.  Lasted less than a day on my Kindle.<br /><br />I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this game worked with no problems.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Love the variety and options available. Helps me sleep at night and I love playing around with the different sounds. I can't believe it was free
B009NNG202|4.0|Catches your attention right away, and it's so strange you just have to keep watchin.  But, not a movie for the faint of heart.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book took me to places i thought never existed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Plz read! I couldnt put this book down!!!!!<br />Plzzzzzz. :)
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|This was both a great read and an informative one. I really like the format. Maybe wouldn't be as enjoyable for non-IT people but it's a great way to expose lots of people to thinking about the way IT should fit into a business.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I feel like there is a glitch or something in the game for me everything is black it has no texture
B000OSDSKM|5.0|The movie reminds me of the story found in the Bible of Satan who waged a war against the government of God and was cast out. A weakness was found in the government of the president - the treaty with the Russians- and in the movie the general exploited it for everything it was worth to try to gain control of the government. Likewise Satan a covering cherub sees that there is a weakness in the government of God, His long-suffering mercy, and tries to exploit it for His own ends. The movie shows how evil has to work to gain control, by using subterfuge, instead of in this movie running for president.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I play all kind of games.but I keep coming back to subway suffers ttrying to get all the money I can.My family Also loves subway suffers.Best of all its for all ages.
B00BF123WG|4.0|A lot of good action but they could have added a few things and they cut some of the background stuff out...just saying.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The nice additions to a couple of episodes, including M.J.Fox and .... I guess you'll just have to watch it.<br />However Season 2 is getting a little predictable but still a great show.
B003IEJZUG|4.0|The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I thought the amount of time from the time Pi was shipwrecked until the ending was too long. I don't want to give too many details and ruin the ending for those getting ready to read it. I am going to rent the movie in the next few days. I always like to read the book first if there is also a movie. I usually read either murder mysteries or romances so this was definitely a different type of book than I am accustomed to. I would definitely recommend this book.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The whole family enjoyed. Well done, story line, acting and directing. The standard to which all TV series should be held to.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|this movie combines all the great things about the movies, 4 of my best actors doing what they do best
B0055XCDZ2|5.0|my daughters watch this religiously. they love this tv show, love that we can get them a day after a new episode comes out
B003L7DK74|5.0|I love the seasons of Flight of the Concords ! Everyone is hilarious and their songs are epic! I give these two thumbs way way up!!!
B003Q97D48|5.0|my daughters watch this religiously. they love this tv show, love that we can get them a day after a new episode comes out
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Just watched all of the Star Wars movies for the first time and they are EPIC!!! Loved every minute of them especially 4-6 :)
B004NELBPC|5.0|awesome way to keep up with the news and current events in our society. love this app would recommend to
B005ZUR724|5.0|The best possible game you can ever get... i really recommend it for  kids and adults its a family friendly game and its fun for everyone
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I really liked the show the first time but after my daughters have watched it endlessly, it is starting to get on my nerves. good flick for girls
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This is good to have with you whenever i need to know something that may be in a dictionary i can just pull my kindle out and i have got what i need......i love it......its a interesting thing to have for nerds like me....well i dont dress like a nerd and i dont act like one but deep down i am one and as a nerd i like this
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Ebay app is very user friendly. enjoy using it on my kindle fire. shop quite a bit on ebay, good app
B00CATSONE|4.0|I was looking for a nice \\"free\\" book being that I read too quickly and my addiction to non-fiction books is running up my credit card bill.  This is a decent read though a little short.  I can't vouch for the historical accuracy of the book as I have not yet researched that but I can recommend it as a nice way to pass a quarter or half an hour and of course being \\"free\\" it is more than worth the price you have to pay.  The story of an intelligent inventor being used and taken advantage of by wealthy evil capitalist men is of course not uncommon but still, delving a little deeper how many men/women have had a dream and so want to see that dream come to fruition that they ignore the details and such of those promising financing?  History after all is written and influenced by the financiers and not the inventors.  This book just serves to reinforce this idea but nonetheless is an interesting and entertaining read.
B008MC175A|5.0|These movies are very very good. I got them a very good price. So much better in HD. I have watched them several times. I highly recommend buying this on Blu-ray you can't go wrong.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I like this app because it is AWSOME and I got a rainbow dragon and the sun and moon dragon
B001VIMCW4|3.0|Lots of action, Daniel Craig is great but an a disturbing place. Not the fun JB we have had. Guess it was time but if your a JB fan you have to watch it.
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|No need to go into a lengthy synopsis of this book, many other readers have pointed out its massive deficiencies. Suffice to say - if Sheldon Cooper had authored this series, his last would would have been \\"Bazinga\\". We as readers have been had. Very funny Mrs Harris, very funny, indeed. (NOT).
B007DIQC90|5.0|Absolutely love this CD, not a single dull song on it, only wish I had ordered two, one for home and one for my car!
B000083E79|5.0|I had been having a hard time trying to find this cd that wouldn't break me and it was a good prince from Amazon so buy it with a few others from Amazon and get free shipping on 25.00 dollars or over that is what i do There are alot of great songs on her but my favorite is Strong Enough' Its just a great song to listen to.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Jump desktop is the essential tools for VNC and RDP it provides streaming for the desktop and multiple devices reliably.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I really had mixed feelings about this movie but when i watched it i loved it. the voices are great the people that did the voices did an excellent job. I love Selena Gomez that is the main reason i bought this so weather your a kid, teen adult it's fun for the whole family. I give it 2 thumbs up and 2 toes up LOL.. Can't wait to see if there will be a sequel to this movie i certainly hope so.
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|I thought that this book was very good.It is one of my favorite books.My favorite character was Matilda.Best book ever.
B00005QCVY|5.0|I loved the price for this dvd and i bought it for my mother for Christmas she loves this movie and has been trying to find it for a very long time. But each time she found it it was too expensive. When she opened this on Christmas she almost teared up it reminds her of when she saw this version for the first time. We rented the color version of this a few years back and it wasn't too great. But this being the original version was great. I would order from this seller again and it came right on time. Thanks
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book was more than I expected, the love story is amazing. Read it, you are bound to fall in love with it. I'm ready for the movie :-D
B00A83075M|5.0|Wreck-It Ralph is great for those who are nostalgic and have played the classic video games like Q-Bert and Pac-Man!  Also, the plot includes being left out and trying to gain the admiration of your peers in a very concrete way, by winning a medal in a game.  It entertained my middle school boy multiple times.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|The characters were very real. I was a pediatric nurse for many years I was involvled with teens with cancer,and they had many of the same feelings and behaviors of the characters in this novel.<br />The writing was excellent.You are drawn into their world immediately,
B000JMKQX0|3.0|As you will no doubt discover early on, this is not written in typical novel style, but rather under the auspices of a collection of interviews with survivors. The stories are riveting, but you have to work at it to piece together an understanding of what took place. I would have preferred a more conventional book, but I very much enjoyed this nonetheless. I suggest a sample to see if the style fits you.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Wow! What an awesome book. I loved every minute of it.  Sadly it ends. Best series I've ever read. Thank you Charlaine Harris.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Bought the full season as a deal from amazon instant video and loved it. Can't wait to purchase season 2 as well. I prefer the digital versions so I can download episodes to any device - forever.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Love the twists and turns in this book, never a dull moment, the book gripped me until the last page
B000Y5JFNY|3.0|The movie, postcards and music is great. The music box works but the is not high quality and broke. Tis is a cute gift for a big fan but you could also just buy the movie which will really be te only thing you use. Might be a good gift for collectors.
B006AN78XS|5.0|It is a masterpiece of imagination and history. Luminous, inspiring, funny and romantic: all these qualities are present in perfect proportion.
B0064MGU98|5.0|While I currently watch  The Good Wife i had never sean the first few seasons so  went back to season 1. It is so great to understand the initial relationships that were formed.<br /><br />The entire cast and story is spectacular particularly if your into legal dramas and company politics. The series is one of the best marathon viewing options available. Enjoy but note, you will dent your couch from watching episode after episode! Love Amazon Prime!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey.<br />Great book, every couple needs to read these books. Good way to spice things up in the bedroom.
B000VIJTVM|4.0|Ben is a soulful sound that will make you lean back and smile. I only discovered Ben recently and love his sound.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|No other words are needed. Castle is simply the best show on tv. It is convenient to be able to buy the instant videos and watch Castle whenever I want also. If you aren't watching Castle you should.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Whether you live Bond movies and action flicks, or lean more toward dramas, this film stands alone and includes dramatic stands from each of the main characters. It drives you to route for good guys, fear the bad and has an explosive finish. I'm not a Bond fanatic, but i Loved it! Acting and story is superb.
B007VTUYWW|1.0|Close your eyes and it was like listening to a Monica Seles tennis match with guns.  Even free this movie wasn't worth it.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|Phillip Phillips definitely found his voice with his first album. Songs from this album have made a lot of my playlists. I've also heard him interviewed a few times and he comes across as a nice, authentic singer trying to make it post American Idol hype. Great new artist and I'm glad I gave him a chance!
B00422LESO|3.0|Predictable, but then again it is based on Austen. I liked it, but bot as much as her other books. Still a fun read. Good escape from the day.
B00123BCKQ|5.0|I think Paolo only made one album, but he made it count. His songs can be heard on many soundtracks because they strike an emotional chord through great writing. Each song collectively fits and emotionally connects. From the upbeat New Shoes to ballads like These Streets, you'll enjoy it all. I mix his songs with Phillip Phillips, Jake Bugg, Steve Earl, Ben Harper, Tom Petty and Grace Potter and its a great playlist
B004VD3YIM|4.0|Lots more features than I'll ever use. I wanted to utilize the sound feature that came with the camera and this app gives that capability. I started with the free tinyCam app and upgraded to this one. Both are very easy to use.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|saw iron man 1, now 2 and it was equally well done. Plot good action great<br />can't wait to see 3
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a very useful app that everyone needs. It is great for adults and kids needing a calculator for homework.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|When I was younger, I remember James Bond being a spy with superior gadgets, fast cars and beautiful women.  Of course, times have changed but I never would have imagined a &#34;bad guy&#34; fondling our hero.  Was that really necessary for the story line?  And the damsel in distress dies a victim that he couldn't save?  It just seems they are getting away from who Bond is.  A fictional character with outrageous qualities.  I am amazed at what is considered PG-13 today.  Seriously?  Why is it that trash is entertaining for today's world.  Yet, so many wonder what has happened to the up and coming generation.  There's a better way & in my opinion (which I think I'm still aloud to have) a better Bond.
0739333305|3.0|Good
B000JCQCW4|4.0|This movie is one that captures addiction and the ugly spiral to rock bottom. The cinematography is timeless with abstract angles and views that capture deep attention. This is a great Friday night movie!!!
B001O1O71C|5.0|Amazing. Perfect for a book report. It helped me understand more about the holocaust. I recommend it to kids who don't usually like reading.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|This book is amazing - couldn't put it down! Definatley the best in the series so far! Action packed - and absolutely captivating!
B0016K40KO|5.0|great buy the service was fast and I'm very pleased with the movie what a classic Amazon is a great source of shopping on-line for persons looking for movies and music that are not available in the stores all the time usually when you want it it is not there and when you are not looking for it it is there. that is how it is always
B000006UNF|5.0|Script was my introduction to the band and still to this day remains the album with the most memorable songs. By the time you reach &#34;Misplaced Childhood,&#34; the sound of the band has changed. Script and Fugazi are the only two albums that have the iconic early 80's sound...and between the two, Script is the best! The enhanced 24 bit version remastered in 1998 is the only way you should experience this album. Not only does it improve the sound quality, it comes with a special bonus disc that contains amazing classics like &#34;3 boats down from the candy,&#34; &#34;Grendel,&#34; and &#34;Market square Heros.&#34; Which in my opinion, all three of these songs have no  business being on a bonus disc but should have been featured on their own album. They are amazing. If you came into Marillion after Fish or have gotten used to &#34;Misplaced Childhood&#34; or &#34;Clutching at Straws&#34; then this work will seem less polished and more edgy. If you are new to Marillion, I would recommend you start here. These songs will stick with you for life.
B00CM96A60|5.0|Another amazing artist album from Armin van Buuren, #1 DJ in the world.  If you are a fan of electronic dance/trance music, this is a must!
B003R50FRI|5.0|Best  book  I've  ever  read  for  along time. Love  the  wisdom  , the  generosity  of  simple  people  and  most of  all  the captivating  way  of  writing  this  book. You  can  not  skip  a  sentence  ,  every  page  has  a  rich  substance ,  you  don't  have  to  reed  about  page  after  page  to  describe  an  ambionce or  a  thing.  You  get it  in  two  sentences and  so  on.<br />Love  the  book

B0060D196K|5.0|Am a huge fan of all things Dickensian. Loved the movie on the BIG screen, looks darn good on my Kindle Fire!  The music sounds great on it, too! Beautiful soundtrack.
1451673442|4.0|Sorry did not view it, gave it to a friend as a gift.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|This album, like other reviewers have said, is just as wonderful as the first.  It is so easy to listen to.  I am a grandmother, but their music is inspiring and keeps me moving.
1582701709|4.0|I am sure my wife will enjoy the book too.she has not read it yet. We will ,in the future order more books
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great show, right up there with Downton Abbey!  This is my newest favorite show and I cant wait for next season.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|The book was well written, and lots of unexpected developments throughout.  Looking forward to viewing Dan Brown's new book as well.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book drew me in right away.<br />I could picture the people and I wanted to know more. Strong start, good character building, surprise ending.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|This is what movie making is all about. A fantastic telling of a fantastic tale with all parts woven into a seamless, long story that seemed short, movie experience.
B005LAII12|2.0|I thought it would be funny, but in my opinion it was stupid. the end was kinda touching but that's it.
B0091WQ58E|2.0|I did not enjoy this movie, and did not even finish watching it. The fight and action sequences were laid out uniquely, and I enjoyed Robert Downey's interpretation of Sherlock, as well as Jude Law's Dr. Watson, but the whole of the movie just never jelled for me.
B000C20VPA|5.0|seen the movie years ago. needed to get it on dvd. only had it on vhs. still an all time favorite
B00B5HQL50|3.0|The best part of this movie, besides Daniel Craig, is the theme song sung by Adele. An average movie for a James Bond series movie.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|I don't like Tom Cruise, So when my husband wanted to watch this, I really wasn't into it. However, I have to say this is the best of the four. There were still a few unrealistic scenes. But overall it was worth watching.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Have all the CDs Susan has released. Can't wait for a new one to come out. Have given this CD as a gift also.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|I would not recommend this movie to anyone. If you watch the first five minutes you'll know what I mean. The way it was filmed, and the idea behind the story. Just not what I was expecting.
B0098460O4|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable music. Really enjoy listening to these two artists. Hope they release more CDs soon. Gave this as a gift.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun I really like it I play this game everyday. I told all my friends about this game ans the downloaded it and said the same thing it was fun. Thanks for making this game.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Other reviewers have summarized the plot.  Landay does a good job of maintaining a sense that there is more to the story than Jacob's arrest and trial, but the denouement, when it comes, feels like it has been too long in coming.  I listened to an unabridged audio version and if I had been reading, rather than listening, I would have skimmed some of the book between the arrest and the beginning of the trial.  The legal aspects are believable and authentic and the ending, while surprising, is believable.  A good book, worth your time, but not a great one.
144234430X|4.0|Wow...King went off on a tangent here with this subject, and he goes off on multiple tangents throughout this tome, but it is compelling.  I have the audio version, which is well-read by a narrator using a variety of voices and accents to make it real.  It is a bizarre and unexpected journey.  True to the historic record, but with artistic license taken where blanks can legitimately be inserted.  It has caused me to revisit You Tube quite often to remind me of forgotten personalities and introduce me to ones of which I was never aware of being connected to this seminal event.  It is long, it is rambling, and there is a ton of activities and people to keep up with.  Worth the effort!
B0057R5G6E|1.0|Love the quality of the movies and got a good price for the set.  The only thing they forgot to mention is that the digital copies had expired before I purchased it!  False advertising!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|this movie was full of blood sweat and tears but I loved it and would def watch again and again
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is my favorite game. Very addictive. Updates are great and happen often. Great combination of old and new. If you ever played the old middle command you will love this game.
B0041VV03A|5.0|love this actor and the splice creature  she was superb and so was the story line, actors and outcome  with a twist of realism
B007A2O3FO|2.0|I wasn't happy with this movie. As a matter of fact it just didn't hold my interest enough to watch it from beginning to end.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is awsome i love running my own city. Could be a little cheaper to buy stuff though. Its easy to learn to use and you gain money so fast. But be careful because as quick as you get it the more expensive things become.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I am hooked. This was the very best PBS series ever. From beginning to end. I liked the program/series so much I decided to purchase the DVDs for my library collection. I can't wait for Season 4 to see what surprises they have for all of its viewers. If you haven't watched this series, watch it. You won't be disappointed.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Just absolutely love this show!  The acting is superb.. I love how the show is actually shown on location.. It is a beautiful period piece..  The way the actors work together is one of the many reasons I like it so much.. It is fun to watch and I can't wait to watch the next episode... Also, the castle is beautiful ... The area surrounding the castle is beautiful...Would love to go visit...
B004UC4HCG|5.0|The best feature of the shuttle is its compact. Takes up so little room. I used to have towers and it just took up so much space. This shuttle ROCKS!
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|it's a fun game but it needs a lot more time if it unlimited time it would super fun but otherwise it's a cool game:)
B0067EKYS6|4.0|This is a review of Baz Luhrmann's \\"The Great Gatsby\\". Since this is text, allow me to be very obvious with the emphasis...this is a review of **Baz Luhrmann's** Gatsby. If you are expecting a movie that is true to the book, you WILL be disappointed. Mr Luhrmann has taken license with this movie that may irritate some, and I have already seen many reviews to that effect. Are these reviews wrong? Absolutely not!! People are free to dislike a movie as much as they are to love it! I have enjoyed reading the criticisms, perhaps more so than I did when reading several un-reasoned gushes that have appeared in various publications. Now, on to the review. A small preface: this will not be a blow-by-blow account of the movie, there are many synopses you can read for that. This is my (hopefully) reasoned analysis of what makes this a good movie...for me. I hope that this review will encourage some to see what might become a favorite for them, and for those who didn't enjoy the movie, I hope this presents a balanced view of its merits without the usual \\"omg I love this movieee!!!\\".<br /><br />Note: I will be purchasing the DVD as soon as it becomes available and will update my review to comment on quality and content of said format!<br /><br />There are several factors that have led me to this positive review. The first, and perhaps most important, is that despite having read and enjoyed Fitzgerald's book several times, I cannot say that it is a classic that I have a lot of attachment to. Allow me to explain: I am particularly fond of Arthur Miller's tragedies. I have read them, fallen in love with them, and even wrote my AP English final essay on Miller's tragic heroes. If a director took a lot of license with an interpretation of Miller's works, I may take issue. With TGG however, I do not have this close bond. I enjoy the story, I enjoy Fitzgerald's fantastic writing, but without that emotional connection I think I was more free to enjoy the movie in its own right. If The Great Gatsby was one of your favorites, and you do not believe that it should be changed, this probably won't be a movie you will appreciate. You would be entitled to this, but for the sake of argument (and to understand my review), this is an important point.<br /><br />The second factor that led me to enjoy this movie is that I have an appreciation for Luhrmann's overal style. Now, this is highly personal, and many do not enjoy his carnival-type use of colors, movement and sound. As another reviewer mentioned (and hit the nail on the head), it is almost cartoonish. As with Baz' Romeo & Juliet, as well as with Moulin Rouge, his direction is almost parody-like, often putting ideals over character portrayals. If 'muted' and 'understated' are words you enjoy in connection with a film, this probably won't be the movie for you. To give a more tangible example; if your definition of cinematographical magic is more in line with the work of Roberto Benigni's 'La Vita &eacute; Bella', you may find Luhrmann's brand of magic too brash. My wife came with me to see this movie for date night - she found that the movie was at times \\"too much\\" to handle in terms of audio and visual stimulation. I can absolutely see how this would be true for some.<br /><br />The third and final overall factor, was the acting of the two male leads. I went to this movie with some trepidation - though I absolutely enjoy Di Caprio's acting abilities, I have to admit that I usually do not enjoy Maguire's performances. I cannot really explain why, I simply have found no connection with him as an actor over the years. I am pleased to say that this movie changed this for me. My personal opinion is that Leonardo Di Caprio nailed Gatsby. Richard Brody of The New Yorker disagrees (in a very well-written review easily found via Google), but I think that Di Caprio's performance embodies Fitzgerald's own description of Gatsby, that is \\"\\"an elegant young roughneck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd.\\" At first I was annoyed by the two teenagers sitting in front of us, chortling every time \\"old sport\\" was said, but then I realized that they had inadvertently UNDERSTOOD - Gatsby is living a lie, keeping up appearances, and is doing so in a manner that is bordering on absurd. Initially presented as being almost mythical in social stature, Di Caprio does a great job at portraying a \\"nobody\\" watching his lie fall apart around him. As I mentioned, I was a little worried about Maguire, but he gave me a new understanding of the short-lived naivet&eacute; inherent in Carraway's character, and for that I am grateful. In real life, Maguire seems to have a perennial \\"green\\" way about him - he's 37 and yet has a youthfulness (not immaturity) that only helped convince me when playing Carraway.<br /><br />Now, on to what I didn't like about the movie. Keeping in line with Luhrmann's modus operandi, popular music features prominently in this adaptation. While not inherently a bad thing, I feel as though it was almost done a little *too* enthusiastically this time around. In Moulin Rouge, Baz shook up the industry by reinterpreting classics, a bold move that was applauded by some and despised by others. This time around I felt as though he was almost pandering to younger viewers by incorporating a lot of pop music. Perhaps I'm being unfair, but I don't feel as though such a classic tale with timeless attraction needs help to be relevant for today's viewers. The second thing that was a little irksome was the performance of Joel Edgerton and Carey Mulligan as Tom and Daisy Buchanan. Despite acting the parts relatively well, I felt as though they lacked the multi-dimensional layers of character that their screen-mates achieved. In very simplistic terms, their portrayal was too clean and single-faceted.<br /><br />Overall, was the movie perfect? Definitely not. Were there some areas that were \\"overkill\\"? Absolutely. That said, I have to be honest and say that I really enjoyed the movie as a whole. I appreciated the visual representation of the dichotomy between rich and poor, between black and white. I enjoyed the strong historical context presented, without which the book itself does not make sense. The dialogue was clever in its own right, often funny and rarely boring. Again, if you are not expecting an interpretation of the book, you most likely be disappointed, but if you go into this expecting one artist (Luhrmann) interpreting another's art (Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby) I think you might be pleasantly surprised. Despite maintaining strong allusions to the symbolism and emotional \\"messiness\\" found in the book, I personally feel as though the \\"repeating the past\\" theme was only briefly touched on and not given the weight that I found it to have in the book. Usually I am not surprised when story lines are given preferential treatment over bigger-picture philosophical ideas on screen, but I have to say that I expected more from Luhrmann who usually tackles these head on. Though open discussion of sociology/philosophy was slightly lacking, I think the film did a great job at presenting the ideas of extravagance, deceit and love for further internal reflection, allowing each viewer to come to their own conclusions.<br /><br />One final note: I did not see this movie in 3D, nor do I intend on doing so. There are some movies (like Toy Story 3) that make good use of 3D as a \\"fun factor\\", but I feel as though a classic such as The Great Gatsby does not need it, and I suspect it was done because 3D movies are \\"in\\" right now...<br /><br />I'm not saying you must rush out and see this movie tonight, but I think it has enough entertainment and substance to be worth a few hours of your time.f speech just missed being absurd.\\" At first I was annoyed by the two teenagers sitting in front of us, chortling every time \\"old sport\\" was said, but then I realized that they had inadvertently UNDERSTOOD - Gatsby is living a lie, keeping up appearances, and is doing so in a manner that is bordering on absurd.

157421327X|5.0|I have been doodling while talking on the phone for years, (the old fashioned telephone, that was tethered to the wall and you couldn't really do a whole lot else!) This artistic take on doodling  is very relaxing and fun to do, a very portable and affordable craft to carry to Dr. appointments, etc.. Simple instructions and lots of creative ideas. .

B009NY43NY|5.0|I didn't know how this would end, and was worried I wouldn't like it, but the author set a solid foundation for Sookie's choice, and tied up the ending nicely.  My only complaint was I wanted to know how it all worked out for everyone after the drama.  But when I found After Dead Every After, even that complaint slipped away.  And I pre-ordered it!

B002Z8IWMS|5.0|Carmine Gallo does a great service to presenters by sharing a successful methodology for planning, preparing, and delivery of presentations. I appreciated the sharing of research at keys points in the book that underscores the reason for a particular approach. Carmine summarizes the material several times with key examples to help the reader internalize the learning. My mind is whirling with ideas to improve my own presentations using the methods described in this book. I recommend this book to those that participate in any phase of presenting as a learning tool to improve presentations and delivery skills.

B00BEZTMWW|3.0|Everyone zI talked to said this movie was mediocre but if you wanted to see the trilogy you had to put up with it.  They were right
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All three books were phenomenal! I wish there was never an ending, and I could keep living in that suspense of what's going to happen next
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I went straight through books one and two into this one. There is more build  up here. The payoff is huge. It is a roller coaster ride. It revels new sides to known characters while introducing a few new ones. THe HBO series is veering off in more directions from this book than other first two. It is interesting to see where both roads lead, especially knowing the author is involved in both. If you liked the first two, you have to read this one.

B00BSWMITK|5.0|I've been a fan since Joe's second album Surfing With The Alien.  I've seen him in concert many times as a solo artist, G3 and with Chickenfoot and have all his albums live and studio.  This is album is more of a return to the rocking out style of some of his earlier work and I've been listening to it non stop since I got my hands on it.  Mike Keneally is the perfect addition to his band giving the music that little extra kick.  I'd have to say if you liked albums like The Extremist, Surfing or Is There Love in Space this one's for you.<br /><br />In regards to the people who are bashing Joe for not doing something completely different it's his work he puts his name on it he gets to decide what it sounds like.  If you doin't like it or wanted something different that's fine but just because you don't like it doesn't mean it sucks.  Try having some class and saying something like \\"this sound isn't my cup of tea\\" and use the power cosmic of the internet to find something more to your liking.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I personally loved the ending it left me complete knowing what happened to characters. I loved that katniss acted how a real human would act about the deaths of her beloved ones , her depressing mood showed that she was still capable to feel  after EVERYTHING she's been through,  which makes her strong in the end  . Real or not real .....
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love ant wait for book 3. I loved the first two. Couldn't stop talking about it. Great read. Loved it
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I chose this rating because it was a very good. I liked this book because it was a mixture of romance, tears, and happiness. I couldn't believe that Katniss actually agreed to have 2 kids!!!!! :)  I bet they were so cute!!!! I would recommend this book to 10 year old and up. I personally am 10. I hope that everybody likes this book, because I have!!!! :)
B00846REIS|5.0|Amazing storyline. Amazing read. Loved the characters. One of the best books I've read loved it. Would recommend it to anyone
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Poignant, amusing, fanciful, and sweet on one hand, The Misremembered Man is also horrifying and  appalling.  Yet all of these qualities combine  to make an entertaining book that keeps you engaged and connected to its characters
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the trilogy. I've read it multiple times and will retread it over and over again. Amazing amazing storyline  .
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|I can only read this in bits and pieces, it's so infuriating and is such a gut-wrenching story.  To think that a holocaust like this exists, and even goes on in the 'modern world', to think that a regime inflicting this kind of treatment of its own citizens and then lauded by Dennis Rodman (really Dennis, do you 'get' what's going ON HERE?) is so foundationally upsetting.  So, to say \\"I LOVE it\\" (reading about travesty and torture and deprivation and cruelty); seems to mock the whole premise of the book, and all of the intense suffering of Shin Dong-hyuk and his family.  However, I would recommend it on the I LOVE IT level...if that makes sense.  You can't put this book down; but you must, to stay sane.  Thank you Blaine Harden for bringing this story to light.  The current North Korean regime must go down.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I'm absolutely in love with this trilogy. I've read them multiple times. I would recommended this book to everyone, man and woman

B00571F26Y|1.0|I was very excited to read Wheat Belly. The reviews seemed to indicate weight loss success with this style of eating. I am not Gluten Intolerant, but am always looking to improve health and eating. I have about 15 lbs to lose. The author claims dwarf GMO wheat is the cause of our obesity ills. Remove wheat and you will lose belly fat and a host of other issues like acne, fatigue, IBS and so on. Well, that seemed easy enough. So I gave up wheat as I began to read the overly-technical, overly historical book ( I don't really care what the recipe for bread was back in the hunter-gatherer/biblical times.)  I did not notice any major body changes by giving up wheat, only perhaps losing a little bloat around the middle. I bought a bunch of gluten free foods from the health food store and really got into the wheat free meal planning.<br /><br />The farther I got into the book, however, the more I realized it wasn't JUST wheat you needed to give up to lose weight. Each page I turned was one more restriction..did the author forget to mention until the middle of the book  there was no fruit? No sugar? very little alcohol? no processed foods, no foods with ANY type of starch , so therefore none of the gluten free flours or snacks are acceptable. Oh, and no corn, potatoes, soybeans, oats etc. because they get cross contaminated with wheat. THIS IS ATKINS! No matter how many times the author says \\"This is not a reboot of Atkins\\" don't believe him. It is the exact same but even more restrictive in some ways because it isn't just net carbs that count. There are no starches or malodextrin allowed, things commonly found in atkins bars and shakes.<br /><br />I followed wheat free-fruit free for 4 weeks and lost ONE pound. When I did eat a few bites of birthday cake I got horrible intestinal cramping and issues. So once you give up the wheat, going back on it is not really easy.<br /><br />I am not disputing the author's claim that wheat is probably bad for you in its new GMO form. I'm sure from a health standpoint it's probably not doing us any favors. I also agree that \\"one ingredient foods\\" are best for you.  But as far as weight loss, this book stinks. I've been on every diet known to man, the two that were the most successful were Weight Watchers and Food Combining (Suzanne Somer's diet book called Sommersizing.) I know she is not who you think of when you want a nutritional expert, but she is actually very informed and the plan works like a charm. It is based on not eating carbs /proteins-fats/fruits at the same time. You can have them all, just spaced out. I lost 11 lbs in 9 days doing that plan. WW was slower going but you got to eat \\"normal\\" food just smaller portions. Both of those seem like healthier alternatives to this one. My afternoon fatigue did not go away when I gave up wheat as they author swore it would.<br /><br />I guess at the end of the day I feel I got bilked by another \\"magic bullet\\" diet plan. Giving up wheat did nothing for me, and I feel like I've wasted valuable time getting ready for summer. Shame on me for being a sucker, and shame on this author for for pretending he has created a new miracle diet.m sure from a health standpoint it's probably not doing us any favors.

B003XWEQ1G|4.0|We first saw this movie in the theater. I thought it was a good historical (before I get crucified here, it's not historically accurate; how about historical-looking?) action flick with Ridley Scott's usual fine eye for visual detail. You felt like you were living in the squalor of the Middle Ages. No Technicolor prettiness here as in earlier versions of the Hood legend. You could almost smell the people's dirty clothes and unwashed bodies.  The actors were well cast but were never overpowered by the visual tapestry of the scenery and costumes. The most striking difference from other versions is that this Marion is more feisty than usually portrayed as just a pretty dressed up damsel in distress. Running an estate for ten years while her husband was off to the Crusades made her a strong woman who could do her share of the farm work and verbally & physically spar with any man who crossed her. We're just not used to seeing an independent Marion so hardened by the weariness of daily toiling etched in her stern face. No time for her to lounge around in glamorous gowns; managing the estate comes first. Cate Blanchett ably matches Russell Crowe as an equal in character and performance. At first it seemed preposterous for her to take part in the final defense against the French coastal invasion, but when you think about it, it fits with her character.<br /><br />Scott's Hood is a darker version in more ways than one compared to others and its downbeat ending and minimum of humor, unlike the Kevin Costner one, turned off some viewers and critics who also complained about historical inaccuracies and Crowe's accent changing from English to Scottish to Irish which Crowe angrily denied as \\"bollocks.\\" In fairness, Costner was also criticized for his sometimes English accent throughout the course of his film.<br /><br />Watching the uncut version on Blu-ray last night was better than I expected. The uncut version breathes more detail into characters and plot. It's longer by 15 minutes for a running time of 2 hours & 36 minutes but doesn't seem padded with needless exposition like some expanded editions. The video transfer is very good as details are clear in dark scenes. The DTS audio's  surround effects are spectacular especially in reproducing the twangs & thwacks of bows & arrows at play and dialogue is mostly clear. On some films we have to run the subtitles instead of constantly playing with the volume control because you can't hear the actors clearly but this soundtrack wasn't a problem for our old ears. BTW Is it only us who notice this problem in some films?<br /><br />Viewers who think Errol Flynn was the definitive Robin Hood should give this take a chance. OK nobody was as dashing and charming as Flynn in heroic swashbuckling roles but Crowe is a different Robin for a different time as was Costner's. Each version is good in its own way. If you like long movies with lots of details and that take their time to tell a good story (maybe sluggish for some), this one's for you. Battle scenes are impressive in scope and not overly gory, and it's worth the wait to see Mark Strong as the villain get his comeuppance from Robin, making up for a narrowly-missed earlier opportunity. Although this film underperfomed at the American box office, it did well enough around the world to make it a financial success, contrary to hearsay that it was a flop. My wife doesn't remember seeing the theatrical version because she said she couldn't have been impressed by it. LOL She had a different opinion this time so skip the theatrical version.<br /><br />This Blu-ray combo is a bargain at such a low price. Another good pairing of Scott & Crowe plus with Blanchett  making for a powerhouse trio. The film is open for a sequel but I doubt one will be coming since it wasn't a mega hit. Otherwise, highly recommended.nutes for a running time of 2 hours & 36 minutes but doesn't seem padded with needless exposition like some expanded editions.

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Often with a saga of this magnitude, there is a feeling that everything has just gotten out of hand and gone on much too long.  Often such extended stories end in a way that is ultimately unsatisfying because - apparently - the author just got tired of writing them.  I'm here to tell you - that does not happen here.  If you've liked the cycle enough to come this far, you should most definitely read the ending.  Just spectacular.<br /><br />Thank you very much, Mr. Sanderson, for so faithfully completing Mr. Jordan's masterwork when he could not; for him, and for all of us.

It doesn't take long to play a couple and it could get addictive. It's my new favorite thing to do when I have a few spare minutes. Very relaxing and helps keep my mind revved up.
B000002JSN|5.0|Zeppelin's sixth studio album appeared in 1975, a generous 80 minutes of music spread over two 12\\" vinyl disks in those days known as a `double album'.<br /><br />PG contains a mix of styles ranging from pounding hard rock numbers (`Trampled Underfoot' was inspired by Robert Johnson's `Terraplane Blues') through poignant reflective songs with great dynamics like `Ten Years Gone' and `Down by the Seaside'. Add in a boogie-woogie jam, a short acoustic guitar piece, a thunderous 11-minute re-work of the gospel classic `In my Time of Dying' and the seminal `Kashmir': an epic, majestic number of awesome power \\"like the last dinosaur on Earth walking up the path\\" by common consent one of Zeppelin's finest moments (if not THE finest) and you have a truly classic album. In fact, PG is so packed with great songs it's difficult to pick out highlights without going through the complete song list as many excellent reviews have done already.<br /><br />If you're new to exploring the music of this talented British rock band from the 1970s, PG might be a good place to start because it has just about everything. Around half the songs were new compositions from 1973-75 and the remainder re-worked numbers - in some cases extensively re-worked - which hadn't made previous album releases, for example the title track from the `Houses of the Holy' album which didn't make the final cut of that 1973 release, but was revived for inclusion on PG. All four band members are here on top form, the contributions of John Paul Jones on `Trampled Underfoot', `In the Light' and `Kashmir' being particularly outstanding. The end-result is every bit as great as the `runes album' (LZ4) but more stretched-out and varied with greater scope; more the rounded collection than unified vision.<br /><br />PG showcases Zeppelin at the height of their creative powers and belongs in any collection of classic rock music. It's still selling after 35 years, still sounds fabulous and has found new generations of young fans not even born when this music was created.fans not even born when this music was created.

B00821OX98|5.0|Falling Skies is a fun series produced by Spielberg.  The plot develops over the course of the series and only improves with time.  I've really enjoyed watching and look forward to season three being released on Prime!

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is the game for puzzle lovers.  A long-time fan of the puzzle-heavy Legend of Zelda series,  this felt like a Rubik 's cube inside a puzzle box thrown into a Victorian Hyrule possibly written by Neil Gaiman.  Fantastic.  Can't wait for the next Room!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Honestly it was what I heard about Chris Kyle's work with veterans that interested me more than his high kill total. It is a real shame that work cost him his life. Personally I don't think we should have invaded Iraq, but have great respect for the men and women of our armed services. They don't decide who we go to war with, but go in harms way when and wherever our nation sends them. Mr. Kyle comes across not only as a great soldier, but as a great man that was willing to die for what he believed. Which I suppose he did.<br />The writing itself was a bit stilted. A collection of short stories and anecdotes. The unpolished style gives it a more honest feeling, like you knew Chris for a while and he told you bits and pieces to a time. Probably over a beer.
B0067EKYS6|5.0|\\"The Great Gatsby Film\\" featured a wild but entertaining tale of the complicated love triangle between the characters of Tom Buchanan, Myrtle Wilson, Daisy Buchanan, and Jay Gatsby.  Joel Edgerton and Isla Fisher did good jobs in capturing the torrid but scandalous romance between Tom Buchanan and Myrtle Wilson. However, I admit that my three favorite character portrayals in the movie were that of Jay Gatsby (played in an extraordinary way by Leonardo Dicaprio), Daisy Buchanan (sensual and brilliant portrayal), and Nick Carraway (outstanding performance by Tobey Maguire). I personally feel that Dicaprio really became one with the Jay Gatsby character and brought the Gatsby persona to life. It was both touching and tragic to see how far he went for his love of Daisy Buchanan. You then have the character of Daisy Buchanan who is mutually in love with Jay Gatsby, and is conflicted on what to do. Last, but not least, there is the heartfelt depiction of Nick Carraway as one with a strong conscience and sees mainly the best in Jay Gatsby. However, his natural concern for Gatsby towards the end of the film was portrayed in an extreme light.  \\"

B004X6PRO6|4.0|As a novel I need to give this book a four star review, as historical fiction The Orphan Master's Son earns five stars. A number of readers criticize the book for not being believable, and finding difficult to believe and slow. The story requires a level of suspended disbelief to accept the story. Adam Johnson decided to write the first half of the book through several distinct stories from the perspective of a single individual. The events themselves are not believable or plausible, let alone have a single individual experience each of these events. However, what is amazing are all of the events are based on interviews of individuals who managed to leave North Korea, visits to the country, and other sources. Treatment of North Koreans by the Dear Leader's dictatorship is unbelievable. The horrors are difficult to accept and comprehend, but N Korea as one of the most backward nation and disregard for its own citizens and humanity is real.<br /><br />The second half of the story follows the life of the main character and at times is a somewhat confusing because the storyline is not linear. Characters take names of other characters as personal names in N. Korea do not have the personal meaning that is universally accepted. This use of taking names or having new names assigned adds difficulty in following characters and knowing individuals. But that is part of the story or tragedy of N Korea.<br /><br />One of the most fascinating sections of the book is a section that is a steam of consciousness. While being drugged and beaten for a confession the lead character drifts away describing his thoughts and drifting away from reality. The main storyline leads from the N. Korean countryside to Pyongyang. The storyline is not plausible but the focus on canned peaches as a delicacy, the now lack of peaches, the level of starvation, eating birds for a meal, a family glad to have a squirrel for dinner, state television wired into every home ala 1984, makes the book an essentialread.  The storyline and dialogue is not the best, but is well worth reading and an important story.<br /><br />As a companion read Escape From Camp 14 by Blaine Harden a biography of the only individual to escape from a N Korean prison labor camp. This individual was born in a labor camp because of the digressions against the state.by his grandparents.  Another riveting book about the Russian gulag during Stalin is is A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich by Alexander Solzhenitsyn.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|This is a great documentary that should be watched to know what is happening to our states, planet and the long term effects it will have on many.

B009AMANBA|5.0|Steven Spielberg is a genius with his casting- Daniel Day Lewis is excellent as Lincoln he is a superb actor and excels in this film. As a Brit. I did find the story a little bit difficult to follow but had an &#34;interpreter&#34; watching with me. and that helped. The whole film is worth watching
B004HW7JH4|5.0|The video pack was here quickly in good shape and all the cds worked fine. I've purchased other dvds that didn't work properly - this was package well also
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|What a wonderful film. Everthing about it was brilliant acting, singing (and what a surprise that was to find that both Hugh Jackman and Russel Crowe had lovely voices) Having seen the stage version many years ago in London I was worried that the story would be changed a little bit and for the better. I advise you to have plenty of kleenex with you as parts of it are very moving. Watch it as soon as you can it is well worth it.
B0072NWKEC|5.0|Huge and unapologetic Kerr/Gunther fan.  Kerr has the Raymond Chandler/Dashiell Hammett thing down cold - the snappy dialogue, the tough-guy ethos and wardrobe, pragmatic intelligence and a nose for trouble, and ethical and moral battles that individuals fight every day, but the complexity and the stakes in those battles are magnified ten-fold.  Bernie Gunther is a decent man caught in the nightmare of NAZI Germany - a man who loves his country but is appalled by what it is becoming and cannot leave because he thinks he can make a difference.  In \\"Prague Fatale\\" Bernie is thoroughly enmeshed in an extensive plot that challenges even his powers of detection.  Truth seems elusive at best, twisted and mangled by the NAZIs.  Bernie's blunt willingness to speak truth to power seems to amuse them, as if he were part of a museum display of ancient German culture.<br /><br />The cast of characters is drawn from history, and Kerr handles them well - projecting their natures based on their known actions and creating a plausible world for us to visit, peering over Bernie's weighted shoulders.<br /><br />But mostly I am drawn to the \\"code hero,\\" Hemingway's man of steel (and doubt) who confronts an indifferent universe filled with random accidents and irrational hostility with dignity and grace under pressure and presses ahead with his duty, modest in victory and stoic in defeat, but he also understands that, as in \\"The Old Man and the Sea,\\" \\"A man can be destroyed but not defeated.\\"<br /><br />Well-written and well-wrought, I highly recommend the entire series - if you like Chandler, you'll like Kerr.  If you like Marlowe, you will love his German cousin, Gunther.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|What a great show!  This is one of those shows that got cancelled before its time.  In this one season, 14 episodes, they pack a lot in.  There are a lot of unanswered questions left b/c it ended up being only one season...but some of those are answered in the movie rendition, Serenity.<br /><br />If you like Battlestar Galactica (one of my wife and I's favorite shows) you will LOVE this.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We started watching Downton Abbey at the recommendation of a friend. We've now been through all three seasons!!<br /><br />The cast is great, the contrast between the landed gentry and the servant class of early 20th century England provides a glimpse of life in an era now for the most part gone. The story is set in a time when major societal upheavals were changing the lives of the landed gentry and serving class alike, creating new challenges and stress. The story lines, the characters and filming are engaging and entertaining.<br /><br />We've watched seasons 2 and 3 from Amazon online and have been very happy with the results.
0061998494|5.0|Besides being a well-written, fun and funny story, it is an amazing story of recovery.  I always thought that Craig Ferguson was more than a little nuts but now I know that he also is a compassionate, courageous human being.

193700788X|2.0|I looked forward to this book Since I finished the last one.  I pre-ordered the book in my excitement.<br /><br />What a disappointment.  It has inconsistencies in characters. Especially in Sookie. Absolutely disappointed.  I fell in love with Sookie immediately in the books.  I looked forward to reading the new books every year.  It was a good escape from Trivial CRAP that True Blood turned into (sorry I loved the books more.  AND they made more sense..... King Bill Anyone?).  I think she lost the plot of the books for awhile now.  Maybe she become disillusioned with what True Blood changed some of her characters into.  But I had hoped that with this final book she would go back to what made the series great.  She didn't.  Instead continued on the horrible path set by the last couple books.  If the last couple of books have been bad and inconsistent for you this one will be as bad if not worse.<br /><br />--------------SPOILERS-------<br /><br />----------------SERIOUSLY don't read further SPOILERS------------<br /><br />I expected the ending.  She has been BADLY hinting to it.  And I had steeled myself up to expect it.  I loved the Sookie Eric Storyline But I saw the END coming and could even understand some of it (she has said she wanted Babies).  For Eric to leave with Freyda and for Sam to become the \\"love\\" of Sookie's life.  I could NOT have been more wrong. I steeled myself up for the WRONG event.  There was no big love scene no declaration that would turn her from Eric to Sam.  And it wasn't a quiet evolution either.  It was a quick SLAM BAM thank you mam.  Eric Becomes who he has NEVER been.  A sad Pathetic sack who cowers away with his tail between his legs, with VERY few little swipes of his personality.  A new child appears although in previous books I'm sure I have seen him name Pam as the only child who he created.... that turned well.  Instead I would rather have had Eric Kill Freyda and Take over her territories.  Instead its indentured servitude for himself for 2 centuries one of which Sookie barely bats an eye.  Even though its on her behalf and takes away Erics beloved Freedom.  Bill is just the nice normal dead guy next door with Just one shining moment of temerity.  Sam.  OH sam.  I can't even touch him.  So deep is my disgust with this character.  Amelia shows just how untrustworthy she clearly is AGAIN.<br /><br />I was GLAD to see that Jason marries a Good woman for him.  That Tara finds her friendship back. That something good becomes Pams.  That Sookie SEES she does have some support in her community with her friends and family.<br /><br />I hated to see Sookie transform.  She still hasn't really accepted herself and in the arms of her community and Sam probably never will.<br /><br />I really don't like most of this book.  Moments of good is all it really has.  A few pages at a time.  You get a small spark of what could have been only to have it snuffed out.<br /><br />If this is all you can give then PLEASE lay down your pen Ms. Harris.himself for 2 centuries one of which Sookie barely bats an eye.

193700788X|1.0|I have listened to the Sookie series on Audible books and found this book disappointing on many levels; I and my fellow Sookie fans have spent the last year rolling around theories  and scenarios we hoped would come about in the ending of the series and never would I have believed that Ms. Harris would give us such a uncomplicated and boring wrap up of the world of a characters she was able to make us adore.  The story didn't match up in it's narrative with the rest of the series, in that it wasn't written in the same style and even the reader Johanna Parker seemed bored.  I know it is too late to stop most folks from shelling out their money on this book as any true Sookie fan pre-ordered it; but if you haven't....honestly, it would have been much less disappointing if Ms. Harris had refused to even write another Sookie Stackhouse book.  Just goes to show you, when someone tells you something, listen!  Ms. Harris did say she had to end the series because she had nothing further to do with the character and she wasn't kidding.  I think that the only way Ms. Harris could even remotely \\"save face\\" for this book is to possibly have a world-wide writing contest and challenge her fans to writing a new last version of the Sookie Stackhouse series because she has proved beyond a doubt with her lack-luster ending that she has lost her zeal for the characters.  The disjointed story has insultingly boring ends for beloved characters besides Sookie including Eric and  Bill, and things that were hinted at in other books were never even wrapped up.  Straight up, bad work!<br />I have never written an Amazon review before and it saddens me that a series that has given me so much entertainment over the past few years had ended in a \\"plop\\".  Trust me Sookie fans, don't read the book, you can think up a score of possible ends to the story that will be far better.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I started watching Season 1 on accident, really, and was immediately hooked.  I blew through Season 2 in less than a week, and watched Season 3 in about 3 or 4 days!<br /><br />Season 3 is a very dramatic season, with some very sad, tragic moments but also some wonderfully happy ones.  There were a couple of episodes that I did not think I could bear to finish because the drama and tension were so heavy.  Overall, I think this is my favorite season, though Season 2 was pretty invigorating as well!<br /><br />I seriously cannot get enough of this show, and am having major withdrawals as I wait for Season for to make its VERY SLOW approach!  At any rate, I highly recommend it to anyone.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Shocking, I know, but so much better than the movie. Deeper despair from all characters and higher highs. Loved this one!
B000YJ54DU|5.0|I have read all 12 or so of the Jack Reacher novels and seen the movie..<br />and this latest one, Nothing to Lose, is clearly among the best.

076535618X|4.0|.. you don't really leave the CDF. They still use you. John Perry and his new/old wife Jane Sagan have left the Colonial Union armed forces to settle down on a small colony world, where the big headache is deciding what is owed for accidental goat stud fees. Really. No wonder they take an opportunity to lead a new colony, taken not from Earth, but in parts from 10 other colonies. Except when they were given the job, the CU left a few things out. And they were kind of important....<br /><br />This is the third Old Man's War book. There is a lot less shooting in this one (though there is some) and more government manipulation and rsistance to it. We pick up when John and Jane leave service, and move out to the frontier with their adopted daughter Zoe (Boutin's daughter) and her Obin observers/bodyguards. Maybe not as good as the first one, but still an enjoyable read. But they must be read in order, or so much will not make sense. A worthwhile read for fans of the series.

B0061PEAUY|3.0|This was a fast read, I finished it within 2 days; however that doesn't mean it was great. It started faster paced than Reichs' earlier novels, slowed in the middle but then felt rushed in the end. It was an obvious ending at that, due to poor reveals of information.
B003D0E3FM|5.0|Way ahead of it's time, with a surprising list of what would become well know actors in the cast along with a robot that would end up in dozens of other projects, this is a must see for any Science Fiction fan.

B009NY43NY|3.0|This was the last book in the Southern Vampire series aka Sookie Stackhouse. I felt completely unsatisfied. The book was repetitive to say the least. I felt to much was left unanswered and that at the end, Sookie didn't change, She didn't evolve. I knew for at least last 3 books who she'd end up with, but thought that she would be with this person for different reasons. Could have done without all the food discriptions and focused more on interactions between her guys. Also felt story jumped around and that people were brought in just to make a last appearance when the book could have done well without them. They were just like parsley on the plate, no reason but decoration.
B00BESLHEA|4.0|This was unexpectedly good. It just pure action but the plot is not weak. If you like action movies this is one you should get.
B009K86D86|4.0|This is a great documentary about how the food industry is run in the US. One might have already heard a lot of whats been shown in this documentary but there are still some compelling reasons as to why it makes sense to support locally grown, organic and to stay away from red meat as much as possible. This even motivated me to start a small garden at my place. A must see for all!

B00CKOYVG8|3.0|The game has gotten predictably too commercial, in that it has become impossible to compete without purchasing power-ups.  Playing the game with the provided &#34;birds&#34; only, does not begin to supply the needed power to compete.
B007ME5BUG|4.0|One of the best books I have read about WW2.  A lot of important detail.  I especially like the way Beevor ties all the battles together relating the impact of each on the others.  Excellent book.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I was attracted to the title and stayed for the ride.  This is an old fashioned story that is so unbelievable that it is fun, like a fairytale.  I recommended it to my book club and everyone loved it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Magnificent art. Unbelievable gadgets. Movable parts. Tilting.  Love the eyepiece. &quot;The Best Game I have Ever Played! Ever!&quot; More PLEASE!
B0084B1T8Y|3.0|It was more advanced than the book that was read to me as a child. I was wishing for a more simplier edition, I guess.
B000ZNRBK4|4.0|Great hood for the money. I'm glad I read the other reviews that said it attached by clipping rather than screwing on, because I was prepared for that and fine with it. It stays on fine.
B009AMANH4|2.0|I am disappointed that the dvd disc can not be played on my blu-ray player because it's an NTSC disc which can not be played  on European  (Philips BDP 3100) disc players and is therefore useless. In my opinion this should not be sold to customers outside the US as the NTSC system is not applied in Europe !!!!
B00AN4KHWO|4.0|Swedish band Hardcore Superstar released their ninth studio album &#34;C'mon Take on Me&#34; in 2013. The album sees the band return after a three year absence with the butt-kicking hard rock we all know and love. The album is definitely a solid slice of Swedish “street metal,” but I couldn’t help but feel that there was a little unevenness with this album over previous efforts.<br /><br />&#34;C'mon Take on Me&#34; follows the formula that Hardcore Superstar has perfected over the last decade or so: crunching guitars, great choruses and riffs and tremendous Swedish melody. The record does tend to move up and down some of the time, but it never deters too much to make you think the album is weak. You undoubtedly have some of the bands best and most creative work on the record with songs like &#34;Above the Law,&#34; &#34;One More Minute,&#34; “Because of You” and “Too Much Business.” While other tracks like &#34;Are You Gonna Cry Now&#34; and “C’mon Take on Me keep the album flowing quite nicely, and rocking hard throughout. This album is another terrific addition to your “street metal” collection, and it reaffirms my belief that Hardcore Superstar are second to none when it comes to making killer melodic hard rock music in the 21st century.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this album to all fans of the band and melodic rock tunage; there are some areas you may think sound like filler, but give it a couple spins and you’ll see it’s all killer baby! “Split Your Lip is still my favorite record from these guys, but “C’mon Take on Me” is definitely a fun and enjoyable hard rock record like they made in the old days.
0307476073|3.0|iT WAS MORE OF A CONFESSIONAL THAN AN ADVENTURE.  HER INEPTNESS COULD HAVE LED TO HER DEATH ON THE TRAIL.  AS AN OUTDOORS PERSON, IT WAS DEEPLY DISAPPOINTING AND COULD LEAD TO OTHERS TO ATTEMPT SUCH A TREK WITH FATAL RESULTS.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I love this movie so so much! It is the funniest movie I have scene in years! The characters r awesome! Plot original! I am making everyone I kno watch it. Young n old can enjoy this movie it's hysterical! Good seller too! Just wish it was obvious it was a rental! Thanks tho!
0547848412|3.0|THE MOVIE WAS BETTER. DESCRIPTIVE BUT MADDENING IN ITS LACK OF RESOLUTION.  IT CAN CAU SE DISCUSSION OR DEBATE, BUT WHY?.
B0090X4GLW|4.0|Wish they had taken exact copies of the movie instead of assuming being bought the cd for new voices after specifically going out o buy the cd for what was scene in the movie. The cup song was good admittedly, just definitely not the same feel as the movie. Totally my opinion the music was fine but I bought cd for what I watch the movie over n over for. Not thrilled. Seller tho outstanding! Fast shipping would purchase again fo sho
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Weather Live provides updated weather forecasts in a visually appealing style. Plus, it allows you to add additional cities for a quick look at weather forecasts there. Great app.
B00457X8BC|5.0|Kurt needs to find love. Maybe in the next or last book his character will retire and his daughter will take over?
B001NLKXK2|5.0|My youngest daughter found this book in her home state and recommended I read it when she was done. I bought it and passed it on to another daughter living in my state, who read it and passed it on, etc. Now we have all read it and my youngest daughter and I have both just re-read it.<br />This story can be difficult to read if you are associated with someone that has Alzheimer's, but it also gives some good insight into what you can expect. At least that is what I got from it. Not only do you begin to &#34;feel&#34; the characters, you get to understand a little bit about a devastating disease that is so misdiagnosed, misunderstood and even ignored by too many people.<br />Alzheimer's is a fatal disease, but there are things that can be done to give the patient, the friends and the family that loves them,  some quality time while there is still time.<br />I realize this is &#34;only a story&#34; and only gives one persons perceptions of what living with Alzheimer's can be. There are as many different way to react as there are people to do the reacting. But it is a good story that leaves you feeling like you might be more understanding of others, loving of your fellow human and possibly more prepared for the little quirks of life that may come along. Read it to enjoy the story. *S*
B006LSZECO|5.0|Love this book!!!! Kept me on edge the entire time. Mystery. Thriller. A perfect amount of romance..not too much at all
0385349947|2.0|Clearly Ms Sandberg is an extremely well-spoken, attractive, charismatic, intelligent and (most importantly) VERY well connected woman.  She makes some good points, but trying to emulate her is like taking beauty and fitness advice from Heidi Klum.  In the book she comments that she was afraid her Harvard acceptance would make classmates think she was a 'geek'.....really??  Would she have preferred the local community college?  The Larry Summers connection was key in her fast track to the top. There are many smart capable women out there, but being in the right place at right time and meeting the right people is essential.  The lessons in 'Lean In' are not new (ever hear of Gloria Steinem?) but I suppose having the message delivered by a successful peer makes young women listen.<br /><br />My prediction, she will leave Facebook soon and launch a political career, she has the looks, charisma and the most essential ingredient MONEY (not to mention a top notch publicist).  On a side note,  who is doing her high powered job while she jets around the country 'leaning in' to every media outlet in the country?
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I chose North and South on a friend's recommendation.  The characters are interesting and compelling.  Though it is dark at times, showing the difficulties of the poor laborers of the time, I continued watching to see how things would turn out.  After the many challenges that the main characters faced, i was rooting for them, and it has a really great ending.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This book was a dramatic eye opener for me. To see the true horror of oppression and that even after freedom is obtained physically there is still psychological freedom to obtain.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game was the best fps shooter game in  my life everyone who likes shorting games here you go get it now.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This documentary is excellent.  It's eye-opening and also helps you feel a sense of connection to the world around you.  It will change the way you look at your food and hopefully change where you buy it.
B008BM9L72|5.0|what can i say it is fifty shades can not get enought of it<br />need more books like this<br />need more christain grey

B004UO0SAO|3.0|The program need some instructions listing how to use its scientific and programming features.  A good help file would probably do the job.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|The walking dead is such a great series. I highly reccomend it.  The DVD is just as described. Buy it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Really well-written, heroic, dramatic saga. Highly recommended!<br /><br />I can't wait to see what's next in this WOOL world. Exciting, for sure,
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Pretty good app. Fun gameplay and rewards that encourages you to play everyday.  Long lasting, and the ad isn't terrible
B002APU580|5.0|I love this movie. After I saw it, I bought it. The acting is superb. The story line is excellent. My son was astonished that I loved it, because I am most of the time disappointed when movies that are adopted from famous books. . I almost feel they don't have anything to say that I could relate to. With this movie you are looking through the eyes of a young female that is not afraid to speak her mind and stands up to what she believes in. I highly recommend it. They were able to capture what Jane Austen wanted to portray in her writings.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Awesome thought provoking unforgettable story. I highly recommend it and would have gladly given more stars were it possible. Mitch Albom is a magnificent story teller.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Well written script, very funny.  Loved it.  We watched it twice and decided to buy it rather than renting it over and over.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|As an unpublished author, I love LOVE love this app!  It is so helpful when I am doing research to just pin everything I need in one place for later!  Also, as a homeschooling mom, I can use the app for the same purposes!  Nifty thing!
B004XZR63M|4.0|Veryu interesting book. This was a challenging read where I had to overcome a lot of my principles that had been hardwired since childhood. I have a new view on making money now and am sure I will prosper.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love hoa they go to different cities around the world. Totally addictive game and so much fun to play! Who knew such a simple running game would be so engaging!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I use it along with the charger.  It works better than the original power cord that came with my kindle.
B000002AGN|3.0|I really can't give a fair rating to this iconic album. I am not a big jazz fan. &#34;Take Five&#34; was such  big hit, I find it hard not to love it. But &#34;Blue Rondo A La Turk&#34; has a weird beat that I find annoying. Its arrhythmia seems to cause my heart to beat the same way! As for the other five tracks, I can take them or leave them
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I would recommend this to all audiences, young and old. amazingly done brilliant story. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! deeply touching.
B007TK77QE|3.0|Not a great deal to say of this book very lighthearted and easy reading not something I would buy in the bookshop...............
B0031RS2HC|3.0|Book started off with a great pace and suspense however this was lost towards the back end of the book. Would definitely give another Jack Reacher book a go though. Easy and enjoyable read overall.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|This is a realistic picture of what it takes for a woman to succeed in a responsible job.  If there is one really important take-way for women, it's that you have to take yourself seriously and put yourself out there if you expect others in your field to respect you. You can't just play at a role and stop being a career woman once you close the door to your own home. Being a success in your job is a 24/7 proposition, and you need to be it for the long haul. You do have to make some hard choices despite how we'd like to have it all.  My only criticism of the book is that she repeats this message over and over. I think we all get it after the first chapter where she introduces her argument very succinctly. She couldd really have stopped there.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very engrossing sequel. Quick and easy read which totally emerges you into the story, while preparing you for the finale.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This quirky novel did not grab my interest right away (I was reading it for a book club meeting), but it was more than worth the wait.  Though the heroine differs from me in almost all respects, I somehow related on a visceral level to her trials and struggles with herself and those around her.  The contrast between the delicacy of the flowers, which were her conduct for relating to the world, and her many rough edges, create a tension that is almost unbearable at times.  Even the &#34;happy ending&#34; is tempered and pleasingly unconventional.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Definitely a different genre than I am used to reading. but well written and held my interest once I determine what the story line was.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Fun and relaxing. Great way to unwind after a long day. Keeps your brain engaged. My kids really enjoy playing this and compete as against me.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love it a lot.... but I think it needs horses, saddles, ravines, caves, and to go the real nether.... not just a nether reactors. other than that its awesome..... all I say .... it needs to be more like the Pc version!!!
B003XVYLDU|5.0|It took me some time to work out my thoughts on this book. It covered an array of different concepts from the nature of war through to science fiction. What makes this book incredible is the genuine insight it offers into who people are. I know this may sound like I am reviewing a philosophy text but I believe that's what this book is - just with a more readable narrative.<br /><br />To read the summary of the plot it may sound a little far fetched. The science fiction aspect I think lets the author show the sum total of a persons life and the impact that one thing has on another. This will all make sense once you read it. I was actually put off by the plot summary for a long while despite a number of recommendations. Happily there is no disappointment to be found here.<br /><br />The best way I can summarise how much I enjoyed this book was the fact that I stopped myself from reading it all several times. I could have easily finished it the day I downloaded it. I made myself stop periodically to take it all in and then started again the following day and repeated for almost a week. I think it's rare that you find a book that makes you want to dwell on the finer details as much as this.<br /><br />I hope I haven't oversold it to you but even if you enjoy it half as much as me I think you would consider it a fine read.
B006JRY2QG|5.0|There are not many shows that my husband and I both enjoy watching but this is our new Favorite. We started with Season 1 a couple weeks ago and ate already on Season 4. You will not be disappointed!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|The Orphan Master's Son is a book that will stay in my mind long after the first reading.  It deserved the Pulitzer Prize for fiction.  I can't remember when I have been so in awe of a story, one that isn't really a story so much as the telling of what it's really like to live in a country like North Korea.  And Jun Do is a character unlike any other.  I couldn't wait to get back to the book after an interruption.  Not very many books do that to me.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book highly enough.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the book, hated most of the characters. It kept you guessing until the very end. Quirky and interesting relationships.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|I LOVE ALL OF WILLIE'S MUSIC AND VOCALS AND HIS PRECIOUS GUITAR.  I LOVE THE FACT THAT HE TAKES THE OLD SONGS AND MAKES THEM LIVE AGAIN,  I LOVE THE OTHER ALBUMS I HAVE ALSO.  PARTNERS, STARDUST ETC.  CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ALBUM,
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I think most of us feel the same way -- this guy is a great story. If you get a chance to see him in concert, you should because it's a worthwhile experience. Happy to see him finally get the recognition he deserves.
B00B8WXG9G|3.0|Paul Anka is 71 years old but hasn't lost his voice. The BEST things about this CD are the already released HOLD ME TIL THE MORNING COMES with Peter Cetera, from 1998 and a few other tracks.  Think I'm In Love Again - with Gloria Estefan is outstanding, as is  It's Hard To Say Goodbye - with Celine Dion. My Way - with Frank Sinatra is well done and the icing on the cake for this mixed CD.  Pennies From Heaven - with Michael Bublé works, Crazy - with Willie Nelson does not.  It's not a Paul Anka song and the vocals do nothing from either voice.  Willie Nelson deserves credit for writing the song, but it is a poor version that doesn't add to the compilation.  It would have been better to put an unreleased duet of Paul Anka and the late Odia Coates, since they made many successful duets together. She's A Lady - with Tom Jones doesn't work.  Tom Jones vocals are powerful, as usual, but they overshadow Anka, and makes you wish it was a solo Jones version.  This might have worked better if Paul sang it with a female partner bragging how she is a lady. Leon Russell's track doesn't feature Russell at his best vocally...too bad. He doesn't really blend very well with Dolly Parton, and the opening track makes you wish only Michael McDonald sang it.  The Michael Jackson track sounds like a Michael Jackson song where Anka suddenly drops in.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|I'd rather not write a review for this series.  Although, I enjoyed it very much.  It was the best series HBO produced other than The Sopranos.
B009R659L8|5.0|Many twists. Lots of surprises. This book will be on the best selling list for many more weeks to come.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I hate it when I'm reading a book that is telling a good story but when I get to the end it feels like the author just wraps it up in an obvious sort of happlily ever after scenario.  It's like all of the imagination and work they put in to building the story just falls apart at the end.  I did not feel that this was the case with Gone Girl and because of that I will look for more books by this author.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I was surprised at how much this book sucked me in!  I really enjoyed it.  I've put off seeing the movie, because I really enjoy reading the books first.  I'm very glad I did.
B008ROGQAE|3.0|It was an interesting movie and it doesn't really escape the era in which it was made, but it was entertaining enough.  No academy award winning performances and amazing special effects.  Just a fun romp through 70s scifi.  Yul Brynner plays a good (and creepy) cowboy robot with a hankerin' for a showdown at high noon.  Everyone else is pretty forgettable.  To be honest, the Simpsons episode that parodies this movie (the Itchy and Scratchy land one where the robots go crazy) is probably a little more enjoyable, but it is nice to know where they got part of the idea.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is sooooooo awesome because you can type in ANYTHING you want! I would rate this 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000if I could.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|For some reason I thought I would actually be travelling the trail. However setting up a town is pretty fun! I think it was worth it. Just went fishing and then shot a bear! Would still like to see the classic game brought back with better graphics...
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I Watched every one of the series.  I truly enjoyed them.  I also watched  Season I.  After a while I began to feel I was part of their family.
B007O4XX9K|5.0|Just an old rock and roll fan here.  Love Joe and Love the Eagles!  He still has it and I see him whenever he comes to town.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|was very glad to see this movie for purchase. Disney doesn't even carry the single movie for purchase any more
B002HFP0QU|5.0|My Mom and I have watched this over and over!  It arrived early and in excellent condition.  What more can I say?  Love the Bee Gees.
B009NY43NY|5.0|After reading some of the negative reviews I was nervous about buying the last book and reading it, but since I have read them all I had to finish the series.  I love, love, love this book.  The ending was exactly as I had pictured it from the very first book.  So many are upset that the book didn't end up with Eric and Sookie together, but for me, Bill, Quinn, Alcide, and Eric were all a fun diversion...Sookie and Sam were meant to be together and he unlike the others is willing to go slow and let it develop the way love should.  My heart will forever miss other adventures of Sookie, but so happy to know she is living out her life as a human with a man who she can grow old with, and together sitting on the front porch watching their grand kids play..Good luck and Goodbye Sookie..You will be missed...Sandy
B003UPPO2G|5.0|Think I confused this with my other review!  Love this...have watched it over and over!  Never get tired of their music!  Arrived early and in excellent condition.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I just bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 and I love that I am able to utilize this with Amazon as I just love their site, happy shopping with them, enjoy everyone, give it a try!
B0090O07RS|5.0|Not much to say except I've been a Doors fan for over 45 years! I never get tired of watching and listening to their music!  Arrived in excellent condition and before it's due date!  Never disappointed with Amazon orders!!  Thank you!
B0076DCT2G|2.0|As a big DeMille fan I was disappointed in his latest. The pacing was incredible slow, requiring more patience than I expected. DeMille is great at making the mundane a fun read.<br />I'll look forward to his next outing.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I have been a fan of Harris' Sookie and felt she was true to her character! I was in suspense, read it in a day. Loved every minute but sad there isn't any more.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Book was better, as usual.  Expected more with the stellar cast . . . they were good, but I was amazed at how drastically different they made the movie.
0670023329|5.0|This story is one that should be shared with the world, Thanks to Shins story we know of the camps in North Korea that are killing their own people.<br />Let this be shared with the world<br />Carol
B008RBL87I|5.0|I was not exactly sure what to expect, but with a documentary, that is quite normal.  Werner Herzog isn't exactly normal, is he.  Although slow to build, and the viewer can easily think the film is not leading anywhere, there is a point when the interviews cease, and the combination of the choral music, light, and shadow within the cave create nothing short of art.<br />The film is shot in the cave, of course.  But the narrator's voice seems to build a bridge between you and the cave artists.<br />Imagine:  the cave had humans drawing on its walls for a longer period of time than humans have had writing systems and alphabets. Sublime.
B00338QENI|5.0|Loved reading Henrietta's story. I enjoyed reading it and all the research it contributed to. the human component of the story was wonderful. NOT BORING AT ALL!
B005K17RU0|4.0|its nice that you can program multiple cities, go hour or daily,  and its easy to use. just as accurate as any news weather report.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|cant wait for the new season all the storie lines were great love the acting which the show wnt year around
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|it is great but doesn't have definitions for some words. I would say it isn't perfect also you should have a &quot;enter&quot;  button.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Ms Dugard's own words provide an authentic voice to the emotional and physical journey of the human instinct for survival.<br /><br />As I read the book I found myself asking questions about what I would do and translating her experience to broader contexts of dominance and control in other situations - teenage prostitution, spousal abuse and gang violence, to name a few.<br /><br />The insight I gained from this book is that it isn't' accurate to call it a 'Victim Mentality'. It is much more accurate to identify it as 'Survivor Mentality' wherein someone is focused on learning adaptive behaviors and developing world views to fit into a person's experiences so that it can make some sort of sense.<br /><br />Ms Dugard allows the reader to understand how and why the actions of her captors kept her from reaching out and gives us pause as a society to consider our own culpability in fostering the conditions that allowed this to be unnoticed for 18 years because we were just too busy to care.<br /><br />I finished the book with more questions than answers. Questions about myself; questions about what I would have done; questions about my family and questions about the stories and excuses I make for the times when I might have looked away in the past and whether I will do so again in the future.<br /><br />I was very impressed and very appreciative of her honesty and willingness to be frankly graphic about her sexual abuse and her choice to not place any judgment on its ramifications. It allows the reader to experience the events from the perspective of the 11 year-old child without the baggage of social mores.<br /><br />Overall, a much better book than I expected. Most of these sensational memoirs are lacking the personalized first voice and filled with pop psychological theories and explanation. Ms Dugard avoids this with her own story in her own voice.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is perfect for my daily needs. The large buttons and display make it simple to use. To top it off, it is free!
B001EN71CW|5.0|I can't add anything more to the volumes that have been written about this show.  I simply want to encourage those who have not seen this show to do so ASAP.  It's truly a shame that this show was cancelled by FOX.  I was brokenhearted when I watched the last episode.  Just finished watching &#34;The Finder&#34; which is another great show cancelled by Fox after 13 episodes.  Moronic network!
B001VLXNLU|3.0|First of all, if you're bothered by the overuse of slang and the usage of such 'words' as ginormous and disturbed in any way by the modern lapse of grammatical methods, skip this book altogether because these things will drive you nutty.  These errors are so frequent that it often pulls you out of the story and has you reaching for a red correcting pen.<br /><br />But, that's my only complaint.  I really liked everything else.<br /><br />Zoey Redbird's life changes forever once she becomes 'marked', going through a change to turn into a vampire.  First, her face is now framed with the telling tattoo mark of the Chosen, then her mother and stepfather practically disown her and she now has to move to the House of the Night, a boarding school for vampire pups.  Added to that is that knowledge hat she might not make the full transition, might die before she finds out who she is and what she was really meant to be.  Some things do make her life better- new friends, for one.  Plus, she actually hated her parents and she's glad to be away; there is a potential new boyfriend on the horizon; and, she seems to be the headmistress's teacher's pet.<br /><br />I really did like the book, most especially the character of Zoey.  She is spicy and intelligent and strong-willed.  Just my kind of girl.  While I have read dozens of vampire books and series, this one is really different with some unique details.  I do plan on continuing the series, which must be read in order.  I'm actually looking forward to #2, bad grammar and all!
B009FZFONO|5.0|This season was not as good as season two.  I much preferred the characterization of season two.  But this season has some very powerful and heartbreaking moments that made me cry.  This is the best show on television, period.  Not to be missed even if you don't like zombie shows.  My wife hates anything horror related, but watches this show because the characters are so compelling.
B0047DVHV2|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I have always enjoyed The Stones music and the book provided a great insight into their music, influences and their lives.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is the best British programme around today.  A fine cast, cracking writing, beautiful cinematography all combine to make this a must own.  Buy it on blu-ray to really appreciate.  Can't wait for series four!
B00CM96A60|5.0|Bought this on an impulse and was plesantly surprised.  A really nice mix of sounds to chill out too.  Highly recommended for any Armin and/or trance fan.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|a great game I love memo like that gives u hints and that lots of rewards so you don't need to spend real money kid love playing it
B000XI3TNO|4.0|i bought this because I finally bought Tubular Bell after all these years.  It is a significantly different style but is very good music
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME<br />it's like having your own horse My Horse is sooooo much fun!!!!!!!!!! I love my horse and I love real horses to
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Love having the series so I can watch it over......waiting for 3rd season....bought the first season at B&N.......enjoy your viewing...
B00B52F278|4.0|If you liked the series from the beginning, then you will like War of the Damned.<br /><br />People like this series because of the violence, gore and the graphic sex performed by beautiful babes.  Every woman in this series is hot and just makes me drool.<br /><br />Even the new Naevia grew on me this season.  I still prefer the first actress.  She was much more hotter.  I don't think that the old Naevia would have worked in War of the Damned.  She looked too soft and cute for that role.<br /><br />I take off one star for only one reason.  Every single time an important character got killed in battle, it was always done in slo-motion, especially, the last three episodes.  I thought that could have used a change of pace.  When the slo-mo started in battle, you knew what was going to happen.  He or she is gone.<br /><br />I have to hand it to the writers of this extraordinary series.  People obviously know enough about history to know how this was going to end.  The writers did a great job keeping me glued to this series over the years.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Super action, cute story, and plus the actors are both gorgeous! So cuddle up next to your loved one and enjoy!
B003B02O0A|5.0|A very  good story  from start to  the  end. Can't wait for the next one. Have enjoyed every book that I have read of yours.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this is a very cute game i would for sure recommend littlest pet shop to any with young children I even enjoy playing it :)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love all of John grisham books. He has very imaginative mind. I wish I could write as brilliantly as he does
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I have seen this movie numerous times, and at age 70 I am finding the book a delight in the images it allows me to create.  I suggest reading this book to your children/grandchildren, and then watch the movie with them.
B000E9910W|5.0|I have loved the Doobie Brothers ever since I heard &#34;Black Water&#34; being sung by a bunch of teenagers on a bus ride with the youth of our church.  I asked one of them what group had recorded that and she told me it was the Doobie Brothers.  After returning home from that trip I went to the music store and bought the record album-yes, the old vinyl 78!  Does that tell you how old I am?!  Anyway, I was hooked from the get-go.  I played that record until I almost wore it out.  Then I made a cassette tape of it and played that so many times that the sound was becoming &#34;wobbly&#34;.  After that I bought a cassette tape from the music store and played that until it got lost when we moved from one house to another.  I recently saw the same album for sale in the Amazon store and couldn't resist buying it.  So, since I didn't have a CD player, I purchased one from Amazon, plus the CD, and now I'm jammin' again!  Pretty good for an &#34;old lady&#34; like me (I'm 73!), don't you think?  I love it!
B000SOYEQY|5.0|One of the few movies that I watch again and again.  The performance alone should make anyone a Peter O'Toole fan.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Amazing read.<br />starts with WWI and continues with the lives of people involved from the start of the book through the end of the<br />book.  Follett just has a magical way of keeping you involved in history and people's lives.  No mention though<br />of the great plague that involved the 1917=1918 era.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I like the retro feel that this song brings back. Its not exactly like all the other popular songs you hear on the radio.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Found this book to be very upsetting.  Seemed like such a normal family.  Hindsight was enlightening.<br />Mom was quite a hero
B00A46H3J6|4.0|I love Pearl Jam as they are my favorite alternative band, however I own a &#34;vintage&#34; iPod mini from 2004 and the downloading process was really a pain. I am sure this has nothing to do with the amazon co. itself, its just that I haven't figured out how to add more stuff to my iPod without wiping everything else on there out.<br /><br />Ten is a great album, i'd also reecommend vs, Yield, No Code and Vitalogy.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I've been reading a lot of new and indy authors lately trying to branch out from my favorites. But there's a lot of bad writing out there ... both indy and traditional ... it's discouraging. There's a reason Stephen King is one of my favorites and there's a reason he continues to write and sell books. He's a great storyteller and he know how to write. You won't be distracted from the story by poor grammar, typos, incorrect word usage, run-on sentences and other rookie (or lazy) writing mistakes. I recommend this or any of his books for that matter.
B0013LPS6Q|5.0|U2 is one of my alltime favorite groups, wish I could see them live! This album is fantastic, really no wonder they are still popular today. &#34;Electric Co.&#34; is my favorite. Don't know if this was their &#34;debut&#34; album or not but it is great, even better than &#34;War&#34; and the album they made in 1983 right now I can't think of what it is called. Sometimes I feel like I am transported back to some lost country like Bosnia when I hear these songs. I just wish &#34;Miss Sarejavo&#34; was on this one or War.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I saw all the whoo hah about the ending and the spoilers and I am honestly perplexed. Even more so after I read the final book. I've always been a fan of the series, the first book remains one of my favorites so the last book seems absolutely a natural and consistent finale. And the ending isn't out of left field either. Liked the book very much and am looking forward to seeing what happens in the October wrap up book. Maybe people are confused by True Blood or maybe they just want Sookie to be different.. I don't know but the fan freak out is unfair to a great author with several great series.  Thanks Ms Harris, can't wait to read your next books.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Good book.  A continuation of Tim,s journey.  If you like Tim's books, I would recommend getting this book.  I now know how to make the best coffee ever.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I first saw this while I was giving platelets at the blood bank. It is so inspiring that I wanted to see it again. You will enjoy the freshness and honesty of it. It is well done.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I STUMBLED UNTO THE SHOW ON SCIFI CHANNEL. I REALLY ENJOYED THEM SO I GOT THIS SO I CAN WATCH IT WHEN EVER I WANT.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|A VERY ENJOYABLE SERIES THAT KEPT YOU WAITING FOR THE NEXT EPISODE AND STIMULATED MY TO<br />BUY THE DVD TO FILL IN THE BLANKS.  THE DIALOGUE WAS NOT ALWAYS EASILY HEARD .. PERHAPS DUE TO THE BRITISH ACCENTS.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I JUST DISCOVERED THE FIREFLY SHOWS. SO I GOT THIS AND IT WAS REALLY GOOD. I HOPE THEY DO GET THE SHOW GOING AGAIN.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|The game is easy to play and a lot of fun. Don't worry, it's nothing like Rubik's cube. You can pick it up and jump right in, but it can be hard to put down. I love these kind of games because they are challenging but not overwhelming. It's a great way to relax.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This app is awesome.it has a dimmer and everything. I also like the ability to change the light color.I would recommend this to you.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The writing is great, the story is wonderful, and the character is an absolute blast. I suppose this book counts as science fiction but it is so real it could be happening today. Wonderful detail without being overwhelming. Hard to put down because you want to know what's he going to get into next. Long live the &#34;king&#34; of Mars.
193700788X|4.0|Just finished the last book in the Sookie Stackhouse series.For me it tied up the loose ends and was very enjoyable. I actually felt a long time ago that Sookie would end up with Sam, that Eric would marry Freye, etc. Thank you Ms. Harris for allowing me into your imagination.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The room is very complex and challenging. You will need logic, reason, and luck to unlock its secrets. You'll love it!!!
B004HXIZVC|2.0|It seems that this app on my phone DRAINS my batter terribly when it's on for some reason. When I use the app, within a few minutes, my battery is completely zapped. Ugh.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|The two people at the centre of this story of deceit are both Horrible and deserve each other.There is an absence of morality which is disturbing .I do not enjoy reading about such unredeemed nastiness
B00136NUG6|5.0|Of course Earth Wind and Fire are awesome! That's why they have a GREATEST HITS album; however, they just couldn't fit ALL their songs on the greatest hits album. :-(
B009R659L8|5.0|I enjoy reading all of Mary Higgins Clark books, as far as I'm concerned, there's not a better mystery writer out there!!!!!!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This is a well-built app - they anticipated how best to get news and tweets out on the fly. And it's easy to use!
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|I have not finished reading it yet, but from page 1 this has been an easy read, good info I didn't realize or know before because it was not taught in my schooldays.  I highly recommend it.
B001CEE1YE|5.0|I enjoyed the matrix trilogy. So I got it on blu-ray of course. Nice set. Not really any extras. Just the movies in a box.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is entertaining for the little ones.  My daughters check on the ponies each day and night.  They earn coins and gems to buy things and do things.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I really enjoyed this series. My wife is a big fan of this time period. And well there is eye candy for both of us.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is very realistic looking.  My girls love to care for the horse and buy hats for the horse.  This is a fun game.
B0046JLTAQ|5.0|This has a lot of great songs that I can blast on the way to work and when I hit the school parking lot I don't have to worry about kids hearing bad words. Got to be a good example!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is fun.  My girls love raising the dragons.  They have their own habitat and they can put to dragon together in a habitat to create and egg for a new dragon.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|DragonVale is a wonderful game that sucked my 9-year old in for over a month. She spent hours playing and I thought it was great until one day her park including her hard-earned Kairos dragon, Sun dragon, Olypus dragon...all of it was gone. This game is not like most games that you play and start over, play and start over. This is a game that requires hours and hours of work and can be easily lost in a matter of seconds. If you lose the game, you lose all the time, money...blood, sweat, and tears that you have put into it.<br /><br />It has been like a death in the family to my daughter to lose all her hard work. She cried hysterically and it was painful to experience as a parent. This is BRUTAL for kids and such a heartache. I STRONGLY DISCOURAGE ANYONE FROM SPENDING HOURS AND WEEKS AND MONTHS ON THIS GAME because if you check the reviews, you will see that your hard-earned park will be lost eventually and there is nothing you can do about it.<br /><br />Furthermore, if you are not careful, you can end up with your kids spending excessive amounts of REAL money on this game and you can spend real money and never even get it in the game.
B00C6BA4SE|5.0|I purchased this last night from Wal-Mart for 12.99. Having watched Firefly and Serenity many a time on Netflix, I figured it was about time to own it. The bonus features are visual commentary, picture in picture interviews, digital tour of serenity, commentaries, deleted scenes, extended scenes, outtakes, and a few others. The steel case is a lovely touch, not worth double dipping... shiny never the less.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|This season dexter faces new threats that might reveal the dark passenger, all the while trying to continue his addiction. This season focuses less the heroic justifications of killing and more on the fact that dex is a serial killer, more like his victims than he first thought. I can see how the show is starting to shift towards how dexters fate will play out as the series draws to a close...
B003F3FJQO|4.0|This book is crazy good, I can't wait to buy the next one in the series!!! You have to read this book!
0575096624|1.0|I can't believe how this series has ended.  Terrible and I want my money back.  I have never written one bad review. I loved the Sookie books and the end isn't worthy.  To treat Eric so badly and poor Bill. This book really stunk!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Very nicely done graphics and energetic game play! Fun game! The controls are very responsive and its just an all around fun game to play. Great job!
0345529057|5.0|I was thrilled to get this as a nice package deal, and have found the first books to be so addicting that it is nice to have them received all together so it can be continuous reading at a very affordable price.
1449410243|3.0|I bought this as a joke gift for my husband.  It is a pretty funny read, esp if you have psycho kitties in your life like we do.  The only thing is the whole book takes about 20 min to flip through and then you are done.  It isn't like you are going to re-read it.  We both read it and enjoyed it, and now we have it tucked away for next Christmas as a white elephant gag gift.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|A page turner like the previous ones in the series, makes you want to know more and wishing it never ends.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I take my Kindle Fire EVERYWHERE.  And for the past 4 mths this has been my game of choice.  Everyone asks me about it because is doesn't look like the normal games.  The concept is simple - connect the like-colored dots, colored lines can't cross each other and you have to fill up all the bank squares in order to finish.  The initial boards are pretty easy but once you get into the 9x9s and 10x10s you will find yourself cursing the screen because you can't figure it out.  And word to the wise - you only get 5 free &#34;helps&#34; so don't blow them all on one puzzle board unless you want to pay for more when you get stuck later in the game... and you will get stuck!
B007XGJK4G|5.0|The truth about Bob Marley; the good, the bad, the ugly, the unforgettable and the miraculous aspects & events of his life. A great documentary that's absolutely insightful. Recommended.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|There are a lot of levels.  You never get tired of playing.  Some of the levels are rather challenging but still fun.  Holds your interest.
B008B1BL4E|3.0|This was a little too dry for me and I like history.  It might be good if you were doing a thesis on the beginning of the war
B001XV3LSS|3.0|At first, I thought I wasn't gonna like it but I enjoyed it anyway so I'm giving it 3 stars. I like Jodie Foster and Matthew Mcconaughey so that's a given. The story is just okay though. I wish it explained more about her experience. It really didn't make much sense at all. It's almost a meaningless contact. I assume the next encounter would be more involved?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A very addictive game to play and I enjoy playing it. I would recommend this game to anyone of any age.
B00B4804KS|5.0|What can I say but great 3D.  I believe this is better than the original because the 3D effect makes it more exciting.
0385474547|5.0|Bought this book forms son to read for his English class.  I read this book many moons ago and it is an excellent read.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Andrea sings such beautiful relaxing music.  If you Like Bocelli I know you will love this CD also. Buy it.  You won't go wrong.
B000FA675C|5.0|what more could you want?  Dan Brown writes with much detail and a story line that keeps you wondering and then knocks your socks off with something you never expected at all!  I have watched the movie twice, bought the DVD, read the book and then watched the movie again.<br />And the sequel didn't let you down!
B000TEUSJK|3.0|It was done well.  The photography is excellent.  The story is based supposedly on the history of Caligula.  Be sure you want to view this.  Check on his history before purchasing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|You've heard all the hype and think it can't possible be as good as they say. But honestly it is a good STORY! I can't review just this book with out saying that the whole series is what makes me happy...but don't worry. You can't stop with the first one!! You will read them all ;)
B00CE6E6B2|4.0|overall I like this game.  it keeps me entertained. I just wished my energy didn't run out so so fast
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a great game for my Kindle Fire.  It gets you hooked quickly. Good variety of play.  You dodge obstacles while flying, then shoot the bad guys with your repulsors, unibeam and rockets.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Great, clean fun with wonderful acting.  The setting is spectacular.<br />We got into this series at the beginning of season 3.<br />Wouldn't watch season 3 until we went back and watched season 1 & 2.<br />We can't wait until season 4.
B00BF11STU|2.0|Even for a historical piece, the script and action sequences seemed predictable. Also,since this is part of an ongoing story and many, like myself, would like to see our military come home from Afghanistan,this film kind of felt &#34;too soon.&#34;
B005WNF4NI|5.0|Every once in a while a truly imaginative and challenging composer/artist will come along to quicken the pulse and fire the imagination. This album is mesmeric and is one of the most rewarding aural experiences in recent years. Nicolas Jaar is an artist who I will folow with interest in the coming years.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I love the Sookie saga but this book was horrible. I can't believe it ended this way. After all the great storylines and then this. It didn't even finish the story in my book. Oh well what ever.
B005MJFA2W|5.0|It is a 5 .Daniel  Kahneman earned a well deserved Nobel Prize for showing us new ways of thinking about thinking. This is a must read for anyone involved in thinking about how other people think . His emphasis was on the economics side of life but his concepts are applicable to all aspects of our &#34;doing&#34; process.
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark can't write fast enough for me.  I love all her books and this one certainly did meet my expectations.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|The acting was fantastic, the film was historically accurate, the story line was excellent, and the costume design was well done.
B005LAIISA|5.0|awesome sequel... very funny characters and really great message. plus the extra features are fun for the kids. my son wants to watch it everyday!
B008Z9YGEE|2.0|Check out Battle Royale instead of this. Hunger games steals so much from this movie it's ridiculous. Battle Royale is one of my favorite movies.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|we loved it! my son never gets tired of watching it. it has lots of action and adventure and is very entertaining.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I love Diane Lane and she was perfect in this role and I am glad I was able to get this dvd.Perfect movie.
0385349947|5.0|This is a great book - and I read all the reviews prior to reading it.  Although the author comes from &#34;means&#34;, something several reviewers commented on, I just read it like some ordinary person wrote it and I feel it applies.  I am not jealous of her and what she'd done for herself or what she was born in to.<br />I work in a male dominated business and I'm giving a copy of this book to my male boss.  I also sent extra copies to some lady friends at work that are on a career ladder up and might want some insight.
0553214632|5.0|I liked the book immediately after I unpacked it. It is of good price and quality and based on the first edition of this classic. You'll love it!
B0087ITBPC|4.0|I saw this movie with two of my friends and we were all cracking up.  Maybe the younger crowd can't appreciate it but the 30 and up definitely can. It was like watching a reality movie. Kids tend to forget that although their mom aren't what THEY consider cool, they should be treated with love and RESPECT.  They have definitely earned it.  Barbara Streisand was very funny, as always.
1449512569|1.0|This classic should have been a wonderful read. However, this edition proves a miserable read instead. Why? The font is so small and the font type is so thin, which turns every minute of reading it into pain and suffering. I have tried to start reading it but have had to put it back to the shelf after one or two lines each time. How disappointing! I'll simply return them without hesitation.
B00BLGZDVS|4.0|Robyn Hitchcock & the Egyptians had a song lyric from an album they released way back in the early 1980's -- Airscape was the song. It had a line that seemed to me to describe how this film about belief, delusion, and mental illness made me feel after I watched it. &#34;Save your illusions, for someone else, save your illusions, for yourself.&#34;<br /><br />This was definitely not a clean and tidy film about deconstructing Scientology, it's about way more than that. It sort of haunts you weeks after you've watched it. A strange brilliant thing.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Great movie! I watched it with a few friends and we were all blown away by this movie. Everyone should put this on the must watch list!
B0091REZMW|3.0|super fun game. I wish there was a way to get more gems though. but other than that this game is fun and addicting
B0067R0APK|1.0|Accuweather needs to hire more qualified developers and do thorough testing before releasing very buggy, poor quality product. Especially if you are charging for the app. Just read all the poor reviews.
B004H6G0TI|4.0|This game would be fun if i could figure out how not to crash right away.  The graphics are great and the controls are easy but I just never could get the hang of it.
B003NS2T9G|5.0|I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for children.  The content and graphic nature of this program makes it strictly suitable for adults and late teens.
0989254607|5.0|The TEGEN CAVE is packed full of suspense, mystery, adventure, romance and horror with mafia-like intrigue and violence thrown in.<br /><br />Poisonous spiders, friends-who-aren't, mysterious strangers, a handsome man, lies and manipulations keep Sara Jones fleeing from one place to another trying to understand what is happening and who she could trust. She must find a way to escape these people and bizarre happenings that grow more terrifying by the chapter.<br /><br />In this excellent piece of writing, Inge-Lise Goss did a beautiful job keeping me reading and guessing throughout this fast, well plotted novel packed full of believable and interesting characters.<br /><br />I loved it.
0142000655|5.0|I was completely absorbed, mesmerized and fascinated by this book.  Steinbeck has such a genius for realism.  I was very impressed with Steinback's &#34;Grapes of Wrath&#34; when I read it for the first time last year.  And &#34;East of Eden&#34; surpassed my expectations as well.  It is tragic, moving, inspiring and philosophical.  It is sincere without being sentimental.  I would almost call it transcendent but the core of the book is so no-nonsense and so utterly American that I hesitate to use that term.  Steinbeck imbues these characters with all of the contradictions and opposites found in life.  The outcomes of the lives of some of the characters often surprised me.  Whether they were good or evil--I was able to relate, identify and feel compassion for most of its carefully delineated characters.  Steinbeck elucidated the gray area of their inner lives with meticulous detail.  The people of this book are thinking people.  They ponder, they wonder, they ruminate.  They are always questioning.  They struggle to maintain a balance between good and evil within themselves; they struggle with the torment of their souls.  And most of them try to love each other as best as they can.<br /><br />The saga starts in the era of the Civil War, continues through the time of the robber barons and the adventurous pioneers who have come out to the Wild West to make their fortunes, resolving itself in the era of World War I.  Kate Trask (Cathy Ames) is the undeniable &#34;villainesse&#34; of the book--At first I viewed her character as an outright psychopath.  She is completely amoral; definitely a hustler; a gangster from a film noir picture; a criminal genius who manages to commit atrocious deeds, all the while evading prison or punishment.  Though ultimately she can't evade the conscience that she tries in vain to deny that she has.  The corrupting influence of money is a major theme of this book.  Kate Trask deserts her husband to become the madame of a whorehouse. Out of guilt, Kate leaves her fortune to her son Aron Trask. who is traumatized upon being introduced to her by his brother Caleb (Cal) for the first time as a seventeen year old [to escape it's ugliness, Aron Trask imagines the world as being very pure].  Cyrus Trask makes a fortune whose legality is questionable.  Cyrus leaves this fortune to his son Adam who essentially becomes a &#34;fine upstanding citizen&#34;.  Cal Trask earns $15,000 selling beans, to make up for his father Adam's losing &#34;lettuce venture&#34;, and then burns the money when his father won't accept it--He tries to buy his father's love and fails.  However--Adam's refusal of Cal's generous offer is also a tragic mistake that leads to this novel's d&eacute;nouement.<br /><br />Samuel Hamilton and Trask family housekeeper / confidant Lee act as this novel's philosophers.  They are both great thinkers; yet both are down to earth and lacking in ego.  The supporting characters / minor players of the novel are compelling as well.  Tom Hamilton has the capability for greatness and yet struggles with self-doubt over his intellectual and creative worth.  Dessie Hamilton is a warm, laughing character who brings happiness to the lives of everyone around her.  But after selling her business and moving back to the ranch that was her childhood home -- She is suddenly afflicted by sharp, shooting pains and shortly thereafter dies of an unnamed terminal illness.  As happens in real life -- Fate determines how much time these characters will be allotted for their respective existences.  In 'East of Eden&#34; -- Too much good in life is usually followed by too much bad.  In the same way that the drought years follow the wet years of the Salinas Valley ..... In closing -- The 1955 film version of &#34;East of Eden&#34; pales in comparison to this novel.  In fact the film &#34;East of Eden&#34; only manages to cover about the last 200 pages of the novel.  I would not recommend the film; it is pastel, cardboard stand-in, supremely abridged and modified version of this book.  The film also makes major compromises to the conservative mores of the 1950s.  It would probably take 3 films, lasting at least 2 hours each, to do justice to the brilliance of the novel.<br /><br />Stephen C. Bird, Author of &#34;Any Resemblance To A Coincidence Is Accidental&#34;modified version of this book.  The film also makes major compromises to the conservative mores of the 1950s.  It would probably take 3 films, lasting at least 2 hours each, to do justice to the brilliance of the novel.  Stephen C. Bird, Author of &#34;Any Resemblance To A Coincidence Is Accidental&#34;
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|A great game for relaxing and enjoying!! I like to play this while I am winding down a little at night.<br />and basically any other time also..A typical match game with so many extras!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is an awesome game. but it  takes forever to get invest points to get monument. Eiffel tower,collesceum,big ben.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is hard with creepers and skeletons, it is so fun. You can make one of the coolest houses you have ever seen. If they add iron doors, have neverending land, and redstone. It would be bettter than the PC.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|I had very low expectations for this movie, but was gut-bustingly surprised by how funny it was.  It does have some<br />of the usual Hollywood things but stood creatively on its own, enough not to be fully absorbed by the hollywood formula.<br />Solid movie.
B001M4YZ90|5.0|I genuinely enjoy watching this actor as he portrays a character with style and believability even when the character does not seem outwardly to warrant those adjectives.
B0097K21YW|2.0|I could not say it better...So very boring, couldn't play past the first world with out falling asleep. See above comment...
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|James Marshall Hendrix was so prolific and proves it with every new release.  if you close your eyes, you might hope that you were there when this music was first recorded.  you should enjoy this music very much.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|this book seemed forced and rushed.  I felt like she didn't want to write it but had to wrap up the story some how especially at the end of this book.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|you will find old and new favourites in this collection from a talented musician.  great music for oldersters and hipsters.
B008N1V11U|5.0|It's cool that the game is done it's pretty challenging.<br />I like it a lot but it is kinda hard.
B0063IH60K|5.0|solitaire helps keep you busy even when you're alone. I like playing random game it's. alil more interesting. good game!!!
0143116371|5.0|What can I say about the phenomenon that is the sartoralist? The photos are perfect, the inspiration is modern but timeless. Just enjoy it.
0805092447|5.0|Instant hit with my great grand baby.  He sat transfixed on my lap while I read it to the very first time.  Now, it is the first thing he takes from his toy closet, brings it to me and will crawler up, with assist into my lap, plop himself down and take this book and goes through it for what seems at times, for forever.  His favorite pages are the three last pages, the kids, the color squares and the page with all the characters.  Plus the inner covers with multiple small images of all the characters. It will not surprise me if we go through more than one copy of this wonderful book.  Thank you

B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I enjoyed Downton Abbey so much I bought it as a Mother's Day gift for my daughter-in-law.  She loves it also.<br />We can't wait for season 4 to begin and we'll purchase it also.
0393039765|5.0|I bought this hardcover edition of Fight Club for my English professor. I have the paperback edition of it and I love the book. It is somewhat different to the movie (especially in the ending) and what I liked the most is that it goes deeper into the life of Marla Singer, which is something that the movie hardly depicts. It comes with an afterword explaining some of the movements the book has ignited ACROSS THE WORLD. It's been translated into many languages. Another thing to be aware of, the first time I tried reading this book, I had already seen the movie and I stopped after chapter 3 because I felt it even went line-by-line with the movie. Later on, however, this changes and the book becomes a separate entity. Even the ending changes. I like both endings equally, though.
B003PJ6UHA|4.0|The author is not trying to change your mind about anything.  He is simply stating his theory and I find it interesting.  It is the type of book that I will re-read soon because I have to digest what he is saying.  I will see more when I read again.  If you like to look at life differently, this book would be for you.

B00ATUEKY8|4.0|Sylvia writes beautifully and evokes many different emotions. This book was overwhelmingly sad for me, however. It is not a bedtime story.
034580404X|3.0|I read the trilogy, the first book was the best of the three.  The author could have stopped there, the second and third were more like romance novels.
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|I think that a person needs certain level of consciousness, and spiritual enlightenment to see those patterns in your life and to understand hundreds of millions of years of life that is repeating over and over again and finally understand that even all﻿ knowledge that elevated us so high pulls up old reptile way of living too. We need to continue to fight from generation to generation and bringing something great contributing our drop to the ocean of amazing life in the future.

0307346617|5.0|I am probably not a totally objective reviewer having been a fan of zombie movies for years. But I have to say this book is very well written from a point of how governments would respond,collapse etc and the breakdown of society. This book is done in a style of the writer interviewing survivors after the plague has been defeated but claimed 90% of the worlds population over a 10 year period. Good read and I highly recommend it.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I know a lot of people are complaining about the ending, but I am quite satisfied! It won't please everyone, but I respect charlaine Harris' vision of where she wanted sookie to end up.  I'm bummed that it's over, but it's been a great pleasure reading this series!
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Some aspects of the story were really intriguing, but there was too much in the way of recycled story. The dialog was often trite, and the characters seemed more like characatures. The main character was likable and sufficiently dynamic, but not so much for the rest of them.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|Any Zep fan (or fan of classic rock, for that matter) will be thrilled by this concert DVD/CD. Just seeing these guys on stage together again is almost worth the price, but they perform like they've got something to prove and boy, do they deliver. How Plant manages to hit those stratospheric high notes after all these years is beyond me, and the instrumental talents of Page and Jones have only strengthened with time. Bonham takes after his old man with a thunderous stomp. It's a must-have performance. The sound and video quality are both excellent, and while I agree with other comments about the rapid camera cuts, the distraction is offset by a concert for the ages. Wow!

B008RTE08E|4.0|If you're a fan of The Beatles, you'll enjoy it. It's a treat to see them being silly and having fun in this clearly unscripted program. You'd never see anything so creatively quirky or improvised by a major pop group these days. Ah, the 60's! Of course, the music is amazing. The video quality is also good. There are some interesting special features, as well. But don't expect a compelling storyline, because it's not there. Otherwise, enjoy it as a slice of 60's pop culture. Anything Beatles is good by me!

I liked everything about the product, the discs have printable tops to make to easier to label the discs and with nothing else written on the disc it is easier to read. I would definitely use this seller again.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|If I could, I would have given this a 3.5. It's better than OK but I don't think it warrants a full 4 star rating. I thought most of the actors were good, the storyline was good, but I felt Sean Pean over acted a bit. At times the violence was quite graphic, but overall I would definitely recommend this movie.

1400069289|4.0|A bit of heavy reading but well worth it. Finally a book that doesn't promise miracles but scientifically explains the basis of habit formation and reversal. I didn't like the last 3rd of the book at all, however, and felt it would have been better without it. This is a book that will forever change how you view habits and social tendencies.

B0058YPL66|5.0|I love this show. It is so entertaining and the characters are so enjoyable. I love that they put a twist on many of the fairytale characters and didn't go by what we remember from our Disney movies. Every episode they put a little focus on one character so we get their back story and I like that. Cannot wait to see what's next
B0079LJZG8|5.0|Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy perfectly takes you into the world of mid-cold war espionage. Its the early 70s, and the two superpowers are at a stand-still. Past the heated early days of the cold war where Russia and the US were racing to gain a territorial or weapons advantage. At this time the lines have been drawn and it has set in that both superpowers are roughly equal in terms of military power. This is the long slog. A time when a mild manored and good wwii vet can make a difference.<br />The plot is simple. A mole has made it to the top of the British intelligence service and it is one of four people. It is the job of our hero George Smiley to determine who. But throwing out accusations against top level civil servants is something that can not be done lightly and George will only come calling when he has the man red handed. If it was a matter just of guessing then anyone could do it. Only a man of his temperament and skill could accomplish this and that is why the under-secretary has tasked him with this mission.<br />I think a word of caution, everything is on the screen... but don't expect to see it. This is a world of nuance and the clues don't jump up and down and say here I am. This film isn't a who done it. The question is why, and when you know why. The actors become more clear and a soft spot In the plan becomes visible. Push the right buttons and the mole will reveal himself.<br />That being said if you expect to 'figure it out' this movie will simply leave you frustrated.  I don't think that you really have a chance of understanding the whys unless you have read the book. The fun of this movie is watching George do his job masterfully.

B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|Cloud Atlas is a truly unique, entertaining, and inspirational odyssey of the soul. It tells 6 different stories in six different genres that span 6 different times with each story involving how a few different archetypes (or if you wish souls) interact with each.<br /><br />Although it may be tempting, do not watch this movie in the hopes of patching together a common timeline or reincarnation cycle. Each story is referenced in the next chronological story  and it is hinted that some of the stories within stories may be fictional. This is an interesting take, on the effect of writing across time.<br /><br />All of what I have mentioned is also in the book and this movie is a competent re-telling of the book. The stories in the movie are intertwined while in the book each story is told in two halfs one in the first half of the book and one in the second half. I think this is a wise decision to help make the movie flow fluidly. The movie does a good job of helping you keep track of each story and the way it cuts the stories together help you see their similarities. Each of the sub stories could be a solid entry in the genre of film that it represents. To be able to combine these genres is an amazing feet.<br /><br />I have now seen Cloud Atlas 6 times and the movie inspired me to read the book. And each time I watch it I see more. Cloud Atlas gives you a lot to see, think about, and feel.

B00B23Z2IE|4.0|Charles Bradley is a street survivor, a graduate of the school of hard knocks, an almost mini Dickensian tragedy who somehow at the age of 62 released a passionate debut album which invoked the ghosts of great soul singers of yore not least Otis Redding and the Godfather of Soul, James Brown. The latter reference is hardly surprising since Bradley made a living moonlighting as a James Brown impersonator for many years Check out please the excellent documentary \\"Soul of America\\", that premiered at SXSW in 2012 which tells his fascinating and often harshly painful story of Bradley on his journey to stability and potential worldwide domination. \\"Hyperbole\\" you say? Not at all is the retort since anyone listening to Bradley will recognise the deep well of exorcism that Bradley excavates tapping into his﻿ painful backdrop and downright harrowing experience. He also is a perfect fit for out times arriving when the great Daptone label set up by soul saint Gabriel Roth with his partner Neal Sugarman, from the ashes of Desco Records, is firing on all cyclinders. With acts like Sharon Lewis and Naomi Shelton it has recognisably become the most influential and highly regarded name on the soul and funk scene today with a roster of acts which can blow most bands of the earth's axis.<br /><br />\\"Victim of love\\" sits formally in the 10 year old tradition of this stable and is full of that classic authentic soul which regularly re-emerges when other music forms plummet and bore. Bradley floored this reviewer when he did a smoking version of his single \\"When the world goes up in flames\\" on Jools Holland. The good news is that there are songs on \\"Victim of Love\\" of that equal class. The brilliant semi acoustic soul ballad of the title track sees Bradley dominate the microphone in a way that only great singers can with a vocal that pours out sheer emotion. The echoes of Al Green on the standout \\"Let love stand a chance\\" are there for all to hear but is its fine old song with platinum solid backing from the Menahan Street Band. Those horns on \\"Crying in the Chapel\\" resonate with the sounds of The Mar-Keys and The Memphis Horns, and that Bradley vocal cries out for a cloak to be fetched on stage and draped over the singer as he is pulled off to the strain of massed horns, tearful high emotion and ecstatic applause. More highlights follow not least the joyously cathartic opener \\"Strictly reserved for you\\" which contrasts sharply with the psychedelic soul of \\"Where do we go from here\\". Granted the instrumental \\"Dusty blue\\" does not really add much other than signal midway; equally while this is a darker album than the 2011 debut \\"No time for dreaming\\" if it was paired up as a double there would be continuity. Who cares however when we have songs like \\"Confusion\\" to celebrate; some 3.45 minutes of hard funk which will drown clubs across the USA in pools of sweaty dance and movement once played. Despite this throughout the record it is that old Stax style soul that impacts the most with \\"Through the storm\\" greatly impressing.<br /><br />There is real joy in the passage of Charles Bradley from the struggling street existence to recording star. It in turn begs the question why with a walloping sob of a voice like Bradley's it took so long for a discerning record company executives to recognise the raw talent on display and frog march him to the studio headquarters to sign a recording contract (probably the fixation with wretched pretty boy bands is the dastardly culprit). But let us not end on a bitter and twisted note for the remarkable vintage voice of Bradley now presents itself for your delectation and what fools you would be if you didn't indulge.m solid backing from the Menahan Street Band.

193700788X|2.0|I am generally an easy going person when it comes to entertainment.  I love things most others think i'm crazy for and I accept a lot of plot holes and craziness to appreciate the story itself.  That being said, this is the first book I think i have ever rated at two stars.  Normally they will get 4 or 5.  This one though, left me feeling empty at the ending.<br /><br />I won't go into the storyline character for character as others will, so I will just harp on a few points.  SPOILERS BELOW<br /><br />Sookie is a character I can ultimately relate to.  She seems perfectly normal, but for this unseen problem that has dramatic ups and downs and makes others think she's off her rocker.  I fell in love with the world as well, which is much like a world I had a dream about once so it was amazing to read a fleshed out version of it.  I hole myself up in my room and read these books in one sitting and have read them all several times.  So anything I write after this will be a testament to how disappointed I am.<br />SPOILERS BEGIN NOW<br /><br />We all had our favourite love interest we hoped Sookie would end up with.  For the past several months I have invested a lot of daydreams into Eric, because he's mine.  I knew, however, that there were a lot of obstacles to face between the couple if they were going to continue together.  They were not impossible obstacles, but they were there.  I also thought that Sookie may end up with no one.  That somehow she'd end up out of the vampire circle and continue life surrounded by friends and family and that's it.  I even thought about how she could die in the end of the books, and we would see the after effects of such an action with final character progression being shown.  I did not imagine for very long that she would get together with Sam of all people.  it was too easy, too safe as a writer to go there.  Not to mention that Sam had become a sort of background friend for quite a while.  A plot device to throw in when Sookie needed a supe friend or emotional support, or a ride home.  Even when she brought him back to life i didn't think she did it because she would end up with him.  She did it because he was a friend.  I feel confident that her character would have done the same for her brother, or probably Bill, Eric, and maybe Pam.  It's been harped on so often that she has so little family and friends that they are all precious to her.  I believe she'd have brought any of those closest to her back.  Don't get me wrong, Sam is a good nice guy character, but the choice was too safe and too boring.<br /><br />While it was nice to have all of the characters we knew and love (or hated) come back and make an appearance, it felt extremely comical.  Half of them staying inside her house even?  It just seemed too weird.  Too over the top.<br /><br />I think the idea of two enemies coming after her at the same time was good enough, but in practice it was just tedious.  I didn't think Copley was a bad choice, but Claude?  I thought that was terrible.  Niall would have never set him loose and leave Sookie unprotected like that.  Again, it all seemed much too convenient, much too Scooby Doo.<br /><br />The whole book felt rushed and dreadfully slow at the same time.  Things weren't explained that I wanted explained, such as what Sam saw while he was dead, what he remembered of it.  With Sookie being a religious person you'd think that would have come up once she was speaking to him again. The whole going to Eric for bail money seemed very off, considering Bill should have that kind of money stashed away.  CH's sex scene with Sam and Sookie was absolutely terrible.  TERRIBLE.  When you have things like the shower scene with sookie and Eric, you can't end the series on a note like that.  It was just bad writing.  Sookie got somehow pulled out of a bar while dancing with a supe, and with a supe watching her?  I don't see that happening in a million years.  Sam would have shape changed right there and ranher kidnappers down before they even made it to the car.  Ugh.<br /><br />Overall, i had held out hope that Charlaine would try and give it her all for this last book.  She had expressed she was tired of writing Sookie, and I suppose I can understand that, but you've got to really dig in and end on a high note with the end of a series.  If it was known that she was going to end up with Sam there should have been a little more foreshadowing.  She starts the book by saying that she knew what the end was going to be so she's sticking with that and not some of the great ideas fans had come up with.  That's perfectly fine, but if you write a bad book for the last of a series, you're doing yourself a disservice.  The goal is to retain your readers for the next series you plan on writing.  When you show that you can only stick with things so long before you just give up and never put real effort in again, you scare people off.  I know I probably won't be reading another set of her books.  My only hope is that the HBO series ends a little better.  Which, considering where it's going.... I don't see that happening either.  Given they've thrown the storyline out the window though, maybe there is still hope for Sookie to end up with Eric.  But probably not.  It's more likely she'll die.  Which would have been a better ending for the book than Sam.  Or at least the way their story was written.  So this book gets two stars.  I didn't like it.  Two and a half is probably what i'd give it, but that's it.
B00BDSRISA|4.0|The grey clouds part, the chill has gone and the sound of summer has arrived. It is possible to play Phoenix's wonderful 2009 \\"Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix\\" until the grooves wear out and then get another copy and press repeat. This ever inventive French band produce smart, intelligent and finely constructed pop songs that soundtrack your highs and lows, but are especially effective as the days draw out and the brighter sunsets beckon. They are a band so sure of themselves that their latest album which has been four years in the making is cheekily entitled \\"Bankrupt\\". On the evidence here the vaults remain full and for those who wish to completely overdose on a Phoenix extravaganza there is a deluxe edition of this new record that features 71 bonus tracks! It has been widely reported that they had intended to call this album \\"Ludwig Van Phoenix\\" to show a nod of continuity with its predecessor. Band leader Thomas Mars promised that the follow-up Bankrupt! would be more experimental and possibly ` psychedelic' there is however no sharp break here. Certainly the songs are generally denser and a bit more experimental, but the format follows the approach on WAP with largely 3 minute pop tracks hooked around a lengthy middle track. None of this serves to knock off the glossy pop sheen. Ironically the opener to the album \\"Entertainment\\" starts off with a slightly Oriental theme and then sounds in parts like the Strokes of old. Julian Casablancas has been raiding the sound of Phoenix for two albums so its only fitting that they repay the favour in this excellent lead single. More powerful songs follow with an immediate highlight the thudding \\"The Real Thing\\" which will undoubtedly be mixed to death on the internet. The lovely summer anthem \\"SOS in Bel Air\\" follows, granted the lyrics are hardly Shakespeare but it floats along nicely, much better is \\"Trying to be cool\\" which sounds like a potential disco anthem with its huge backbeat and bubbling synths.<br /><br />The long title track is going to be pure marmite. Love or hate will follow as it takes the approach of \\"Love is like sunset\\" and is a French synth cocktail with a nod to Daft Punk infused with tinkling key boards, pounding bass and sonic waves of sounds that builds to a huge crescendo. It signals the second half of the album where despite some of the goodies which have gone before are to be located the best tracks. Instantly recognisable is the Gallic insouciance on display in the \\"Drakkir Noir\\" destined to be on a future Phoenix Greatest Hits album, somehow they then better this with the albums standout \\"Chloroform\\" packed full of an imposing synth wall of sound and Mars exhortation to \\"Buckle up, we'll chase each other/It's not a lot it's just enough to matter/Anyway you want the truth is/I will marry you on Tuesday\\". The penultimate track \\"Bourgeois\\" is almost a semi ballad and a superb pop song , while closer \\"Oblique city\\" may turn out to be the albums best track and begs the question is that the sound of some piano lines from Abba in the background?<br /><br />If Phoenix have had a problem in their very long career it has often been an overdose of gigantic truckloads of singalong melodies which are almost relentless as traffic on the M25 ring road. Like \\"Wolfgang\\" this new album sees more structure and shape, but also a willingness to head off the beaten track when some experimentation adds to the sum of the parts. Granted \\"Bankrupt\\" is not a giant step from its mega selling predecessor that is a very hard act to follow. This leads to the inevitable recognition that on first listens it certainly doesn't top their finest moment. It is nevertheless a fine album and like all others in the Phoenix oeuvre its base square root is danceability and joie de vivre. \\"Bankrupt\\" cements the reputation of this great French band as the \\"go-to\\" band of anyone requiring a pop sensibility so clever it should be awarded an honorary degree. As such time to check out the deluxe edition!le track is going to be pure marmite. Love or hate will follow as it takes the approach of \\"Love is like sunset\\" and is a French synth cocktail with a nod to Daft Punk infused with tinkling key boards, pounding bass and sonic waves of sounds that builds to a huge crescendo. It signals the second half of the album where despite some of the goodies which have gone before are to be located the best tracks. Instantly recognisable is the Gallic insouciance on display in the \\"Drakkir Noir\\" destined to be on a future Phoenix Greatest Hits album, somehow they then better this with the albums standout \\"Chloroform\\" packed full of an imposing synth wall of sound and Mars exhortation to \\"Buckle up, we'll chase each other/It's not a lot it's just enough to matter/Anyway you want the truth is/I will marry you on Tuesday\\". The penultimate track \\"Bourgeois\\" is almost a semi ballad and a superb pop song , while closer \\"Oblique city\\" may turn out to be the albums best track and begs the question is that the sound of some piano lines from Abba in the background?<br /><br />If Phoenix have had a problem in their very long career it has often been an overdose of gigantic truckloads of singalong melodies which are almost relentless as traffic on the M25 ring road. Like \\"Wolfgang\\" this new album sees more structure and shape, but also a willingness to head off the beaten track when some experimentation adds to the sum of the parts. Granted \\"Bankrupt\\" is not a giant step from its mega selling predecessor that is a very hard act to follow. This leads to the inevitable recognition that on first listens it certainly doesn't top their finest moment. It is nevertheless a fine album and like all others in the Phoenix oeuvre its base square root is danceability and joie de vivre. \\"Bankrupt\\" cements the reputation of this great French band as the \\"go-to\\" band of anyone requiring a pop sensibility so clever it should be awarded an honorary degree. As such time to check out the deluxe edition!
0765337541|5.0|This is by far my favorite book and it has a nice resting place on my bookshelf. The spine is worn and shows the stress of being read a dozen times over the past 10 years.<br /><br />I was introduced to this book by a college professor shortly after I started college. He presented the argument that it is a book that will show you how to think and interpret things differently.<br /><br />Indeed that's what this book does. This book is about a time where the planet is under immense danger from an alien species that is trying to eradicate human kind. A young man, Ender, is tapped to go to a leadership school to train to become the next commander of the fleet. The whole book leads to the final attack on the alien species, can this young man.... more a child, can this child save the human race?<br /><br />The book explores the emotions of this child genius as he compares himself to his classmates, his longing for his sister who is out of reach, the pains of being labeled an outcast in the leadership school he is in as his performances rivals that of the upperclassmen, the stress of the realization that he is killing, and the camaraderie that eventually comes with his squad-mates.<br /><br />This book is by far one of the most entertaining and yet thought provoking books I have ever read. I recommend it to everyone I meet and I hope you will enjoy it. I'd also encourage you to read the books that follow this one as they are equally thought provoking and have you searching for the meaning of everything.<br /><br />Question, question, question, your thoughts and beliefs after this book.<br /><br />Definitely read this book before the movie comes out in November of 2013.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|A good app for the person that needs a alarm clock added to thier kindle. Has some nice features and it works. I don't use it often but for those days I needed one it worked.
B0011Z5IXC|2.0|Poorly remastered. Seems to be louder but very flat. It lacks dimension and lots of distortion with the bass. I think they just cranked it to 11 and hit record. Disappointing to say the least. Will be sticking with the earlier remasters for now. By the way, my original remasters are ripped at 128 kbps and this album was ripped at 256 kbps VBR and still sounded worse
B000E9910W|5.0|Bought this as a gift for the wife since she went to see them live. I took the digital download for myself. There are songs on the ablum that are not on the digital download. She loves the CD and listens to it often. As for me i love the music also. A great price and a great buy.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|This movie was LONG or seemed LONG.  The acting was superb and the story is interesting if you like history.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Don't use this very often, but when i do it does take a great picture. You can not beat the price. FREE
6304711891|5.0|The Rock has action, humor and a little bit of drama to suit any one's tastes.  The story is simple, but the actors make it great!  Give it a try!
B00AG51V8E|4.0|After his family is kidnapped during their sailing trip in Spain, a young Wall Street trader is confronted by the people responsible: intelligence agents looking to recover a mysterious briefcase. Stars: Henry Cavill, Verónica Echegui, Bruce Willis. This is a good movie worth the watch and the money.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Pink Floyd is my favorite band. I appreciate their thoughtful yet genius lyrics, their unique and incredible sound, and the way they are still so down to Earth, even after so much fame. They just put on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt and go out there and play great music.<br /><br />If you have been a long-time fan of Pink Floyd, you won't be disappointed with Pulse. Nothing about this DVD will disappoint you. Nothing. Because this concert is, in my personal opinion, the best filmed concert that I've seen from them. I've watched this concert at least 20 times. Many times I will turn it on and let it play while I'm cleaning or doing whatever in the house. It's THAT damn good. So even if you read a review where someone sticks their nose up at a few \\"grainy\\" moments during filming...don't let that deter you. One, those \\"grainy\\" moments are very few and far between, and two, it's about the music. And the music will blow you away. You will feel like you are witnessing the concert first-hand.<br /><br />You don't see bands making music like this anymore.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Pink Floyd...pick this up. You won't regret it. Not a single second.
B009MF5BXK|4.0|Mr. Church reunites the Expendables for what should be an easy paycheck, but when one of their men is murdered on the job, their quest for revenge puts them deep in enemy territory and up against an unexpected threat. Stars: Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Randy Couture, and a bunch of others. I like the first one and for a sequel this is not a waste of time to watch.
193700788X|1.0|If you like the Sookie Stackhouse books then don;t read this one! I will try not to give any spoilers.<br /><br />The book was slow to start. For a vampire book it seriously lacked vampires. The excitement that we got in the beginning of the series was pretty much unseen in this book. It felt that all the characters that didn't really matter (minor characters) in the previous books were all clumped together and did not fit together well in this book. The ending was rushed trying to give an ending that really was not set up.<br /><br />For such a long wait for this book I feel so disappointed.
B00BQI4AU6|4.0|I'm one of those people that thought Cinderella was the best of the hair bands.  I guess they fall in that category due to their appearance not the music.  While other bands made fools of themselves and their music, Cinderella (you could say Tom Keifer) just focused on writing good music instead.<br /><br />This is a good rock album.  You a wide variety from hard rockers to balads.  I pretty much stopped listening to the radio as I don't like most of the new \\"rock\\" that's played on the soundswaves.  That's why hearing a CD like this is refreshing.  Tom's voioce sounds great considering what he's been through.  Hope he keeps on making new music and please don't take another 15 years.
0345803493|4.0|The book was much talked about so I wanted to read it. The first part was kind of unusual, too many erotic details but, I tthink, it something many people lack in their lives.After getting the second part I may say that Ilike it even more. Thank you for sending it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|A friend introduced me to this game. I'm addicted to it. can play it for hours!!! the best part is you don't need wifi to play it.
B0082Z447U|5.0|It has been a while since I have read this style of writing.  Even so I was surprised to find that I enjoyed this book and had a difficult time putting it down. It has stirred a desire to read more classics even ones I have read many years before.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a good game but not to good needs co op running like team up so ya. it would be fun if It had co op so they can split up and run fifteenth ways and meet up
0517543052|5.0|Love all the drawings, the quality of the brown sheets of paper, the biography of Ram Dass.<br />About the subject, in the same category as The Power of Now, A New Earth and The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying.<br />If you're ready for a new dimension, a new life, you should read Be Here Now.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|I really wanted to see this movie in the theater but never got around to it.  So glad I bought it.  I feel they did a great job of capturing the struggles of growing up and discovering one's self.  This movie really resonated with a friend of mine.  He saw it 5 times at the theaters.  For anyone out there who has been abused, know that you are not alone and there is help, love and  hope for you out there.  I hope this is has been helpful.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It's great game but u must be focused 100% at all times. I'm old but it is fun learning to focus on the game
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|$100 to unlock everything?!?! It's an ok game at best but there is no way my 5 year old is going to grab all the cool suits in game, cheap way to make money, gladly pay $20 but $100?!
B00BVDNKSY|5.0|Super addictive and so much fun...worth the money trust me me an my friend love playing it:) like i said lots of fun
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Cant add much to what was already said. Its fabulous!!!! That is all.<br />Just dont stop after 1. Go on to read the rest and watch it bloom into mystery, intrigue, suspense, and humanism good and bad.<br />After reading the bad reviews I think is because to many people dont unerstand the psychology behind this world in the silo. Lack of understanding a well written book isn't a reflection on the artist, author, its just the reflection of the people that dont get it.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|They're all classics - you can't not like them.  I was glad to to read these stories again as the potrayal of the Holmes in the current movies isn't really Holmes' persona at all.
B00AFEY354|5.0|This movie is incredible. I needed it in DVD form the moment I walked out of the theater. The casting and the acting is phenomenal, and I can't think of any better actors/actresses for the roles. It's jampacked with emotions, life lessons, and the right amount of tension, and it really leaves you feeling different after watching it. You're truly missing out if you haven't watched this yet.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun and reminds me of temple run.I think this is a very good app and who ever likes temple run I'm sure you will like this.
0811729117|5.0|This book is fantastic! You feel as if you are right there with Otto Carius. A must read for any WWII buff !!!!!!
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Great movie!! really compelling to watch how it all play out. This is a wonderful country to live in. Great people to watch over our country when things like this happen in our world. Jason Clarke, wonderful as to be expected. Great movie!
B0028KF4M4|5.0|We are hooked on this series now.  It is really interesting the way the writers pull you in and before you know it, your worried that he is going to get caught.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|This is really fun.  I would recommend it to my friends and famlies.<br />Passes the time nicely.  Very Fun to play
B009AMANBA|4.0|Given the fact that anyone who's attended school in the United States knows who Abraham Lincoln is, I'll exclude the summary portion of this review. Now I'm going to warn you in advance that I've never been particularly fond of history so I already knew going in that this wasn't going resonate with me like it did with other people. To be completely honest, I'm ok with that. History is one of those subjects that you either love or hate, there's no real in-between. With that said, from a cinematic standpoint this film does a lot of things well and that's what kept me watching the entire way through.<br /><br />I, like my mother who watched this with me, went into Lincoln expecting the film to cover his entire life or, at least, his entire presidency. Instead, Lincoln covers the last few months of our 16th President's life. So what the viewer sees is Lincoln attempting pass to the 13th amendment and end the Civil War. This, of course, would outlaw slavery in the United States. Because this was a big turning point for our country, and Lincoln's biggest accomplishment, it only seems fitting that this would be the main subject discussed in the film.<br /><br />Visually the film is beautiful. From the sets to the costumes you can tell that there was a lot of hard work put into recreating this time period. Daniel Day-Lweis' transformation into Lincoln is most notable. He doesn't look perfect, of course, but the costume designers really did a great job at creating a very strong resemblance to the real Abraham Lincoln. The script used for the film, while flawed, does its job of telling the story without sounding redundant in comparison to everything we've read in the classrooms. What keeps it from being perfect is the fact that we don't know who most of these people are. You know Lincoln and his family, but everyone else seems like just another face and the viewer doesn't really know what their job is or how they're relevant to the story.<br /><br />My biggest gripe with thefilm is that none of the performances really stood out. Everyone involved felt like they were acting just to act which made some sections of the film excruciatingly boring. For a film to be two and a half hours long the last thing you want is for scenes to feel boring. Day-Lewis gave a solid performance, but he didn't necessarily feel like he was Lincoln. Sally Field's performance as the First Lady was solid as well, but at times felt a little overdone. There's a pretty extensive list of people involved so I won't break them down one by one. I will, however, say that Tommy Lee Jones, in my opinion, gave the strongest performance out of the entire cast. His character Thaddeus Stevens is one filled with so many conflicting emotions that it becomes difficult to pinpoint what his motives are, but once you reach the end it becomes very clear and you can't stop yourself from going \\"whoa\\".<br /><br />Lastly, I found it odd that they didn't really do much to cover his assassination. I was expecting it to be a very dramatic part of the film, but it felt like they just brushed over it. All they did was have a character come into a scene and yell, \\"The president was assassinated\\". Considering that this was a major thing when it happened it felt wrong that they made it seem like a minor detail. I don't know, maybe I was just expecting too much.<br /><br />Overall Score: 7/10 - Look, for the history enthusiasts there's a lot of enjoyment to be found in Lincoln. Assuming that most, if not all, of the content in here is legit, they touched on a lot of things I was unaware of. I knew going in that I wasn't going to leave blown away and this probably isn't a movie I would watch again, but I can't deny that the end result is very well done. What would have made it better, for me, would have been a cast that showed a little more enthusiasm. That's not to say that anyone performed poorly, I just found majority of the performances to be pretty bland. With that said, I would have a hardtime not recommending this to fans of history or fans of Abraham Lincoln because even though I'm not crazy about the subject I don't regret spending the time to watch this.
0062127241|5.0|I didn't know much about The Who until around December 2012 when a relative of mine told me about The Who. I heard that the best albums they made were Tommy and Quadrophenia. I really enjoyed them. I did some research on the two albums and saw that Pete Townshend was behind the music and lyrics of the band.I found out about Townshend's memoir on YouTube. Townshend talks about his early childhood to teenage years to joining the band that would later become The Who. He talks about the troubles of his childhood to adulthood. It is redundant that a rock star deals with alcohol, drugs and women. The way Townshend describes his experiences are amazing. He is also honest on his feelings on going through the good and bad times in a band and his later years. Overall this book is amazing and it helped me understand why Townshend wrote most the songs on The Who albums. If you are a fan of The Who or interested in a good auto-biography, you should definitely read it.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|Decent game for being free, and it doesn't charge you to to keep playing.  You can unlock planes before they become available if you wish though
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Have eally enjoyed this series. The acting is great. Action packed and makes you anticipate each episode. Looking forerd to additional seasons.
B0093FNZT6|4.0|Not sure if I think he really experienced this or whether it was something to do with his medical condition.  Make up your own mind on this story.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This story could have been more developed and involved but it was a good quick read and I recommend it!
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Fabulous book - could not put it down.  A realistic but sensitive portrayal of a very hellish period in the 20th Century.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|Although I couldn't use this for the original gift it was intended (already bought himself) I will use it for a birthday gift for my sister who is crafty.  The actual cutter came very quickly.  I was very happy with the packaging and the seller.
B004S5NKI2|5.0|An amazing story but not impossible in this day and age.  It could happen and it is therefore quite confronting at times.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I liked the pilot character with all his flaws and weaknesses.<br />The ending where the pathological liar can't tell one more lie was overwhelmingly stirring.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This app is awesome, you can change from creative to survival. You can edit your inventory. You can even put stuff into your inventory that isn't in the game like chain mail armour or water and lava. And, if you are low on health you can set your health to infinity or 20. You can even activate side ways glitch. But you have to exit out of your world and get to the main menu in order to make changes to your world, you can even change the world's name
B00BY9GQHM|5.0|not only do you search but there is puzzles in the game.  It is geared to a more adult level than kids yet it isn't as dark as some of the other search games.  I like the garden game I have had in the past but it is geared to a younger crowd.  This is more for adults.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I thought the author did a good job telling the story, though I would have enjoyed it more had he included more details.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was hesitant to purchase the books after reading some of the bad reviews, but I'm glad I did.  I really enjoyed all three, but I thought 2 and 3 were the best.  Very unique story that held my interest from beginning to end.  Read all 3 books in 3 days.

B005ZOBNOI|2.0|Had a slow beginning but th  momentum increased and the live story was  beautiful with the pain of life. Good work
B005BY3XHC|3.0|The book is right to the point and covers some of the most of the  important teachings in eastern philosophy. If you have never read anything like this then can be a difficult read.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Nice story, different story lines untangle, good actors, interesting inside view of lawyers work And court work, too. Good Camera work.
B002HSSAY6|4.0|The cinematography in this restored film is magnificent.  However, if one portrait after another is not to your liking this DVD may not be to your liking.  There is plenty of stylized action for those who enjoy spaghetti westerns, although the plot is thin.  The music is also good, but not up to that in some of director Leone's other collaborations with Morricone.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I always enjoy Juliana Marguiles, especially in ER years ago.  The Good Wife could use a little comic relief every now and then, but as a drama, it is really good. And I really love the commercial free venue.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|very entertaining.  great cast.  solid performances all around.  i'd watch it again.  that's all i got to say about that.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|enjoyable game that makes the time pass quickly. a game that works with out problems and keeps your interest. Recomemd it
B000FP2OPY|4.0|learning about myths and drive , how what a parents passion can do or effect the children they have , then learning about the myths that cause the monsters that haunt children and shape the imagination.
B002BY77CW|4.0|I enjoyed it.  It is interesting to read the story from the point of view of a person that actually lived through this similar experience.  Left me wondering how much reality and how much do-over, retake, etc went on in Lauren Conrads TV career.<br />Will be reading the next book in the series. I was disappointed that this book ended so abruptly.
B00BZODDYU|3.0|For anyone and everyone who wrote that this was frightening, please checkity-check yourself and then go watch Sinister.  Nuff said.  Out.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I loved this book. It started off a bit slow, but turned into a book I could not put down!
B000FCK65W|5.0|I came across this book quite accidentally (there are no coincidences!) and really enjoyed it.  Good story, great characters, a good read.
B003B5M0PO|5.0|I loved the idea and the simple,but highly effective writing style. I was surprised to find that every person I mentioned it to was also enthralled by it.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|You will laugh cry and laugh some more. Its unpredictable and an all around great movie. This is one i even recommended to my mother which is unheard of with seth rogan movies
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and now I own it. Very happy with the quality of the  DVD and Ultra Violet Digital Copy.
B002HSSAY6|4.0|This a typical Sergio Leone movie. Think Clint Eastwood early westerns, only longer and perhaps a little more drama. Its a great cast and they live up to their reputations. Lots of gun fights and sexy women.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book it made me laugh and cry and had me sitting on the edge of my seat throughout the entire book I can't wait to read the next one. Thank you
B00A81NFAS|5.0|Okay. I agree with other reviewers that the book is way better than the movie. I did not read the book but based on the reviews and the movie itself, I am compelled to believe that the book should really be much better. But one must also admit that it is very hard to render or compress a good story that spans several hundred pages in a book into about a couple of hours movie.<br /><br />Yes, the story could have been better rendered in the movie. The storyline had a great potential that was wasted. I also saw on the artwork of the disc that Jennifer Lawrence won 2012 Best Actress award. I wasn't surprised with that. Well deserved indeed. She is simply superb and there is not a single moment in the movie that you would think it is just an act, but a real person in real life, with all the gotchas, like any other human being. Never falling into melodramatic, but straight to the point.<br /><br />The movie starts really slow and the initial part could have been shortened to give more space to the developing relationship of the main characters - particularly to the exchange of letters, which I believe is where the book should be doing better. Anyway, from the point where she reveals the circumstances of her husband's death (\\"That's a feeling\\", indeed!), the story picks up and quickly starts revealing the beauty of that relationship.<br /><br />I particularly liked the scenes shown while playing \\"Girl from the North Country\\". That's where I saw a beautiful story unveiling, somewhat too late in the movie.
B00271DNP4|5.0|In year three, our cast of unique and magical characthers have to deal with a new threat, an escaped prisoner, from Azkaban Prison, who seems to want to kill Harry Potter. Azkaban was a return to the magical formula that made Harry Potter legendary. The story here is suburb and unlike the Chamber of Secrets, it isn't dummied down or rushed for us. New elements are introduced such as the secret map and time travel, but perhaps most important of all we finally see Harry demonstrate some of this incredible power that has led to his fame at Hogwarts. The story was terrific, the action was great, the performances were off the chart, and the childish stuff was kept to a minimum, but was Azkaban perfect? Many critics will tell you that this is the best of the Potter films and it was terrific, but personally I was hoping to see more of the world outside of Hogwarts. I was looking forward to possibly seeing the inside of Azkaban prison and some of the people who are locked up there. While I appreciate the different views and new filming location, it was still centered at Hogwarts. Not a bad thing, but personally I'd have liked to have seen something else. Aside from that, new Director, Alfonso Cuaron, does use parts of the story that were excluded in the previous films, he also does give us a new location, and view of things. Overall, Cuaron really does do a tremendous job, making this film geared more toward young adults than children. Azkaban is much closer to being what J.K. Rowling intended than the Chamber of Secrets was. I absolutely loved this film, there are just some parts of this film that are truly amazing. If you're picky like I am, and are only going to give Harry Potter one shot, then I suggest the film you watch is The Prisoner of Azkaban.

Even though he has left this world his music is timely and will forever stand out as the best of the best. Incredible new tracks, a must have for the Hendrix fan.
B00A1XOPE8|3.0|Being that this was a short story, character development was minimal. Overall, the story was entertaining, easy to read, and a good introduction to this author. I plan on reading more from him.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is definitely one of those books that the review and final star rating will probably depend on your mood while reading it. I have to say, this was exactly the type of book I was in the mood for and I really enjoyed it. It gets 4 stars because I really liked it and would like to read something similar in the future.<br /><br />This book is from TWO point of views: Connor and Megan.<br /><br />Megan is in Vegas for her cousin's wedding. She has accepted that none of her relationships have ever worked out (she was never in love) and she is no longer going to try. She has decided she wants to have a baby on her own, via a sperm donor. She has an entire life plan worked out.<br /><br />Connor is in Vegas with his buddy to hang out and move on from his relationship that just ended a couple of weeks ago. He is not broken up as he wasn't in love and that is not the type of relationship he is looking for.<br /><br />In comes drinking, fun, talking, some quickie Vegas wedding and the morning after. Megan doesn't remember much from the night before and immediately wants to get a divorce so she can continue with her plan. Connor on the other hand, does NOT want a divorce. He tries to jogged her memory about the night before where they talked and concluded they are perfect for one another. They would make great partners in a marriage with no love strings attached. It would be much better than Megan's original plan. He convinces her to give it a trial. If at the end of the trial, she still doesn't want to be married, they continue with the divorce.<br /><br />Of course Connor seems TOO perfect with all of his wooing attempts, etc...And of course there is confusion and they each have their own baggage related to their parent's relationships growing up. So, can a marriage without love really work? Or are Connor and Megan just fooling themselves?<br /><br />So, a pretty predictable romantic chick lit timeline...<br />***SPOILER (If you don't know the typical timeline): girl and boy meets, girl is unsure of boy, boy convinces girl, girl decides she loves boy, boy freaks out starts acting like a douchebag, boy realizes he is a douchebag and tries to get girl back, realizes he loves her too. END SPOILER***<br /><br />All lots of fun! I definitely recommend, especially if you are in just the right mood to read this type of book.<br /><br />Happy Reading!boy meets, girl is unsure of boy, boy convinces girl, girl decides she loves boy, boy freaks out starts acting like a douchebag, boy realizes he is a douchebag and tries to get girl back, realizes he loves her too.

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I was one of the doubters who thought that Brandon Sanderson would not be able to fill RJ's shoes. I was totally wrong. I found Sanderson's style more compelling than RJ, and I was thoroughly satisfied with the ending.  As was apparent in the last two books, Sanderson has such a fantastic understanding of Mat as a character that I thought his depiction of him was better than RJ's.
B0088W4YTK|5.0|This is my favorite of all time shows, the next in line is Stargate SG-1, out of all the Si-fy movies ever made these two are the only ones that relate to the past times of earth in terms of our history: ie the Gods, the pyrimids and ancient past. If anyone reading this hasn't seen them both you are really missing something, note: if is much better to start with SG-1 and follow up with Stargate Atlantis.

B00BC24NT4|5.0|This is the most gripping  LeCarre novel in several years. I am a fan of LeCarre but some of the recent works were not up to his standards.  This novel is a return to his ability to create a completely enjoyable multi-layered work, with complex characters adapting to tense and interesting situations.<br /><br />I would like to comment on the tenor of several of the reviews of this book.  The reviews remind of the political and social narcissism that underpins the political grid lock that we are experiencing in our society.  These individual reviews do not allow, even in a novel, the slightest questioning of the great American might.  These reviewers appear to view the world through a very narrow ethnocentric lens that does not permit them to contemplate the fact that America and our policies are not always correct and helpful to ourselves or for all peoples of the world.<br /><br />I suggest we allow the author to create his world, as LeCarre has done, without feeling threatened as Americans.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS APPLICATION!!!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I downloaded this game for my kindle and once it had finished downloading&amp; installing it said it had to have 500 more Kb just to play it. after that was done and I started playing, I didn't see many more flaws there and I would rate this as pretty good. although I think there should be a free roam and it shouldn't just be flying around but you getting to control all his functions.

B00CJ7EK4E|5.0|Wow!  What a nice surprise. So many other artists of Rod Stewart's stature have been producing such mediocre albums since their heydays in the 70's, this is truly a treat.<br /><br />Wonderful songs.  Great arrangements.  Great vocals.  Stewart's best work since \\"Vagabond Heart\\" back in 1990, with very similar Scottish-tinged arrangements.<br /><br />He sings about the exuberance of love and the pain and disappointment of divorce in a way that truly resonates.<br /><br />And yes, the Bonus songs on the deluxe version are indeed worth the few extra dollars!

It is critical that her phone remain operational because she has children and always wants to be available.<br /><br />It comes in handy for anyone around her.  She's basically a refuel station for all of her friends.  I've used it several times myself.  It charges anyone's phone much faster than their regular charger.<br /><br />I will have to warn everyone to not use the 2 amp port for charging their phones consistently.  Sure, it will charge your phone in a third of the time, but your phone will stop charging with your typical wall charger.<br /><br />We can get close to three completely dead phones fully charged with this device.

But if you are even a bit into it, this is a totally remarkably great movie. Those who give it a bad review are total fools. This is brilliant. Extraordinary. It's late and I ran out of explicatives. Anyone not giving this a bad review I hope is the next target of the Ghost Rider and deserves to be, for attempting to stear you away from greatness.

0525958002|5.0|What the business world can learn from Duran Duran<br /><br />A few months ago, while waiting for my daughter at her skating lesson, I was reading the new autobiography, In the Pleasure Groove: Love, Death, and Duran Duran, by John Taylor, the bass player and cofounder of the band.  A colleague was sitting on the bleachers waiting for his daughter too, also with a book in hand.  He pointed to my book and asked me what I was reading.  I held up the book, smiled and said, \\"The bass player from Duran Duran's autobiography.\\"  He laughed and held up his book.  The title had something to do with business in it.  \\"Your book sounds way better,\\" he said.<br /><br />Having finished the book a few weeks ago, I was thinking about that moment - Two fathers trying to read a few pages in their books while waiting for their daughters.  At first glance, it would appear that one is a slacker, spending precious free time reading about the hyperactive wild-ride of big 80s music icons, while the other is enriching his business skills.  But there's more than meets the eye here.  I'm thinking John Taylor's book might be suitable reading for anybody in business today, especially those in brick and mortar companies that worry about all the shiny-new hi-tech start-ups that want to change the world and eat their lunch.<br /><br />At first glance, it might seem like 304 pages of sex, drugs, rock and roll, and hairspray.  It definitely is all that, and then some, for sure; however, there are business lessons lurking in the penumbras of AquaNet-soaked passages.<br /><br />Here are just a few:<br /><br />1. Do the thing you know you need to do, and don't worry about naysayers.  When John Taylor and his star-hungry friends realized that they were built to bend the rules of fashion and music, they put every ounce of energy into the enterprise and never looked back.  Against all contemporary wisdom and criticism from their elders, they played their guts out until they found their voice and, in only a few years, became one of the most iconic bands of the late twentieth century, if not ever.  Just like Howard Schultz, the founder of Starbucks, never walked away from his dream when he was desperately trying to find support and money for his game-changing ideas about coffee, all awesome products and services were once considered crazy, too expensive, unachievable, whatever.<br /><br />2. Ronald Reagan's mantra was to surround yourself by the best people.  Duran Duran started getting noticed while playing in a local Birmingham venue that also served as their \\"business\\" headquarters for all things Duran Duran.  It wasn't enough that the young band had gobs of raw talent and passion.  They also networked and surrounded themselves with people who believed in them and what they could achieve.  As Steve Jobs could never have reinvented the world without all of the brilliant people around him, very few success stories star only one person, regardless of how much talent and vision they might have.<br /><br />3. Mick Jagger once pronounced that anything worth doing is worth overdoing.  Once the band got their legs and started infiltrating the airwaves of the planet, they didn't stop to smell the roses.  They rode the wave for all it was worth, playing their hearts out in a bazillion venues, producing more and more hits, and never letting their global audience get bored or distracted by their competition.  While there were many, many other bands and singers in the 80s that were competing for the same audience (and money), only a few transcended one-hit-wonder stardom and experienced the chart-topping success that John and his band mates achieved.<br /><br />Apple and Google might not be where they are today if Microsoft retained its innovative and creative edge through the 90s and 2000s, instead of becoming synonymous with bloated software, bugs, and uninspired products.  They lost their way, their mojo, and the competition passed them by.<br /><br />4. Treat your customers(fans) right. Between taking the time to personally answer fan mail, building up one of the biggest fan clubs of the time, and taking every opportunity to connect with their fickle teenage fans, Duran Duran never took their fans for granted.  Leon Leonwood Bean, the founder of LL Bean, believed in delivering amazing customer service and that principle has held true for over a century, putting the company consistently at the top of customer satisfaction charts.  When was the last time you had an amazing experience when buying a product or service from a company?<br /><br />5. Keep the future in mind.  Think Nirvana.  As the 80s came to a screeching close and the British new wave invasion continued its assault on our television screens and radios, there was something new and interesting emerging in Seattle.  Kurt Cobain and his angst ridden friends were about to abruptly alter the 80s feel-good music and cultural landscape. By 1991, Nirvana, Stone Temple Pilots, and many other flannel addicted bands suddenly made groups like Duran Duran seem very junior highish and ready for the MTV archives.  Taylor describes this tumultuous time in his book, and although the band was paying attention to what was happening around them, they had a difficult time keeping up with the changing times and tastes of a hyperactive audience.<br /><br />Is John Taylor's book must-read material for business majors and executives?  Maybe not.  But it does remind us about the extraordinary effort that it takes to build, develop and maintain an enterprise that people want to spend their hard earned money on.  It also reminds us that there is unbelievable power when you combine vision, talent, diversity and good old fashioned persistence in making extraordinary things happen - all the things that every business aspires to have.<br /><br />John and the Wild Boys continue to make new music and, although they don't fill up as many football stadiums as they used to, they are doing what they love and still make people smile, which is the stuff that matters most and can't be measured in any sophisticated business formula.  We should all be so lucky.(fans) right.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed the book and it was very engaging throughout.  It was a real page turner for me and kept me interested as I tried to decide who I thought &#34;did it.&#34;  Much of the evidence point to Jacob or Patz.  Maybe I'm a pollyanna but I was a bit dissappointed with the ending.  98% of the book was great but it was that last 2% I was dissappointed with.

B004DNWPY4|5.0|I like to learn from meta-studies (studies of studies). I like to learn from those who've been successful. This book combines research and practicality in a way that enabled me to shift my outlook towards wealth acquisition and wise spending. I bought the book two or three months ago, and I'm on my third read. Why? Because I'm picking up new insights and strategies each time. The author has done his homework, and he allows the reader to reap the benefits. From the tips in this book, I've already implemented changes that have saved me hundreds of dollars, and stand to save me thousands of dollars per year! (It's like getting a raise... and then another one!) Well researched. Well written. Well worth the read... and reread.

B0012GMUI6|3.0|Roger Waters, despite being a major creative force of Pink Floyd, is only mediocre as a solo performer. This album, as with his other solo works, shows it. In places the music soars, while in places it crashes to the ground. A must for Floyd-ophiles, but a skip for the less dedicated.<br /><br />Oh, and what's with the freaking stupid blackout on the cover? Censorship is for the weak of mind.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|I can't get enough of this album. My only warning is that it does not come with the 2 bonus tracks, but those can be purchased and  downloaded elsewhere. I love how the band is growing and changing their sound. This is one of those albums that you need to listen through the whole tracklist in order to catch all the brilliance of the album.

B003EYVXTG|5.0|When i first heard about Winter's Bone, I wrote it off because at the time, it looked like a Lifetime movie. However today, I watched Winter's Bone and I gotta say: Jennifer Lawrence was born to act. She nails it in this movie like a pro; I am surprised she was nominated for her role in this movie and did not win. Winter's Bone the movie itself has a very dark tone and presence that is consistent throughout the movie. And honestly its nothing to be worried about it is not that the film is scary or anything like that, just one of my many observations of this movie. Although Jennifer Lawrence is the only person in this movie I recognize, the supporting cast did a wonderful job. The whole cast helped make this film realistic as possible and for a 1 hr 40 min movie, it works. The story line is good (and relatable for myself), and to conclude I definitely consider Winter's Bone a movie that is daringly different, and utterly enjoyable.<br /><br />5 Stars<br /><br />Thank You for reading my reviews!! Please feel free to comment, make suggestions, or read any other reviews I have written.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I was interested in a layman's introduction to contemporary issues and life in North Korea and this book was compelling, moving, and very, very interesting. I am used to reading dense political histories, and would have read what was available just to get the introduction I was looking for, so I was pleasantly surprised at the struture: the narrative non-fiction style drew me in and I read it start to finish in a few days. I shared it with friends and family who have also said it was a fascinating read. I was initially deterred from reading the book because I am not a fan of the L.A. Times (the author is the former bureau chief in Seoul, I gather) but her affiliation with that publication in no way impaired this excellent journalistic narrative.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Colleen Hoover is amazing. She sucks you in from the first page. This book is amazing, and the characters are so real it hurts. You may laugh, cry, get mad, swoon, and take your emotions through the wringer in this book, but it is so worth it. I don't want to give too much away, and try not read too many reviews, because there is a shock about 15% into the book that is so good you don't even see it coming. I would hate for it to be ruined by reading something ahead of time.  You are going to love this book, not just Will and Lake, but all of the supporting characters too.  Hoover really knows how to make you care. Oh, and I didn't even mention all of the awesome slam poetry that permeates the book. It is delicious. I read all of her books within a week.  And, Point of Retreat and This Girl should be read after this and they are both just as amazing. Enjoy!
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|Loving Rod since 1968 (even thru the American Songbook years, my word), I am thrilled that the vintage/today Rod is back! Love this new album. Walked the dogs around the lake to it this morning, and I nearly danced for an hour with pleasure. We all get old, we all come to understand the fleeting lives we've lived, and we all have both regrets and hearts full of love. Rod writes about it with truth and clarity. While some of the lyrics are sprinkled with cliches (Tom Waits he isn't), I cried all the way home to True Love. Will be my gift to my two sons when I'm gone. Thanks from the heart, Rod. Glad you're BACK! Will listen to you on Howard 100 Monday.
0525953590|5.0|Have you always been fascinated by questions like: What is the universe made of? How do the laws of nature work? Where is it all going? Where did it all come from? How close are we to the Theory of Everything? If these and all the other profound questions physicists ask are always in the back of your mind, you have to read this work. If you are not a scientist (like this reviewer), it can be difficult at times and you certainly will not retain or comprehend all that the book encompasses, but you should get a good overall picture.<br /><br />How can physicists communicate advanced physics to laymen? You just have to be good at it. There are many PhD's who have egos half the size of the universe (e.g. W. Pauli). They may be geniuses, but not good teachers. You do not want to interact with them socially unless forced to. There are others, like Carl Sagan, who make you yearn for an understanding of the universe and can explain what is known in terms that can emotionally move you. Sean Carroll is one of these guys. And he would not resent being called that. I know that from listening to him on NPR and reading this book.  I believe if you had the honor of sitting at a local pub over a brew with him, he would be equally comfortable discussing the Lorentz Transformations, or something much more mundane, like a good restaurant or place to vacation.<br /><br />The universe is made up of, well, things is the best word I can find in a language that lacks precision. (They all do.) The Higgs Boson is a fundamental particle that is necessary to our existence and matter as we know it, as is the Higgs Field. It had been predicted for many years, but the technology did not exist to actually find it. This is the story of the hunt for the Higgs and the discovery in 2012. If might be described as one of the most important finds in the history of science. Read the book and you will know why.<br /><br />As an undergraduate I developed learning techniques, which help me still today. Of course being a senior citizen I forgot to use them in reading this work. If you are not familiar with the Standard Model, I would suggest making a written list of terms as they come up that you can refer to while reading the book. Protons, neutrons, photons, electrons, quarks and their \\"flavors,\\" massles particles, bosons, leptons and  others. It's just easier looking at your list than going to the book's index and finding the page you need.<br /><br />Also, as an undergraduate, I often found that reading a chapter, or book, once would often not suffice. I am about to read this work for the second time (Hey, I read the Tolkien trilogy 5 times and enjoyed and discovered more each time) and look forward to expanding my knowledge of the universe even more.rse being a senior citizen I forgot to use them in reading this work.

B008V8FVTI|5.0|This is a great movie about kids being kids that turns bad with one mistake.  The best of all though is watching how they get there sweet revenge
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Great perspective on life<br />And is a quick easy read. Mitch Alvin is a genius with words! Must read this!
B00004RCKT|1.0|I got this DVD but it would not play in any of my blue ray players. It kept saying can not play in this region. I never had a DVD do that. I was not happy at all. I just took it ask a lesson learned.
B009MO57H6|1.0|This is by far the worst movie of the series, but it goes well beyond that and also takes its place among the worst movies of all time. No plot, no acting, no reason to watch it. The series ends here for me, no matter how many more they make.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|Touching film and refreshing to hear of someone so honest in who they are and so humble.  Nice to know there are people like that.  And good for him that the world finally paid him his due respect, even if it was all the way in South Africa.  Funny it makes you wonder what is truly reality?  here's a guy cleaning up, doing odd jobs in the USA and somewhere else he's a Major rock star.  But he truly knows who he is and he's the same guy in both places.  Wow that's amazing.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Don't have enough time to listen to the CD, but I love to listen to it when I do.  Love the songs on this CD.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I thought the ending was absolutely perfect. It ended exactly how I thought it would end and have known for quite some time. I feel the author left clues in previous books as to what would happen.<br /><br />I see many people feel the writing in itself wasn't up to par but to be perfectly honest I don't believe it's any different from any of the other books in the series. Perhaps people didn't like it because they were expecting something else but I truly believe that Sookie's story was meant to end this way, actually, I feel that it's just the beginning. I am also seeing that people feel things were wrapped up too quickly and I honesty can't understand why they feel that way. The story has been progressing in this direction for quite some time. Any ending to a story has a climax and it always escalates rather quickly.<br /><br />I'm sorry that fans were disappointed in the ending because I know they have been waiting quite some time for this but as we all know, an author can't please everyone.
B008G12ERC|5.0|I've said in other reviews that I kind of don't like reviewing music, since a) tastes are very personal, and b) I don't even have the right vocabulary (I'm so much NOT a musical person).  On top of that I'm 40-something so my habits just don't mesh with the new short-attention-span track-at-a-time billion MP3 generation mentality...I still like to listen to *albums* all the way through.<br /><br />My first exposure to Muse was their Resistance album, which I've reviewed as good but sort of workmanlike with nice range of styles and tempos and classical influence, most specifically Queen.  That lead me to some discussions with another Amazon reviewer and a purchase of Absolution (which I didn't like as much - the production seemed muddy and the vocals overly electronically processed), Black Holes and Revelations (which I liked a lot - I'm a sucker for SF themed rock), and this album.<br /><br />Where to start?  The first song, to my ears, has all the makings of a James Bond movie opening credits song.  It's got all the hallmarks - the dramatic string flourishes, overwrought cheezy lyrics building to a full throat howl, pensive sections with a pseudo-military march sort of beat, slow build to a raging crescendo after which it fades, with a final steel guitar note, so that I can almost SEE that last credit graphic (usually a gun barrel view of some sort) expand back from the opening sequence into the movie itself.  I'm not kidding - watch a Bond movie, any one of them from the last couple of actors - and then listen to this song, and imagine it over that opener.  It works.<br /><br />The most-played song on the air, Madness, follows up with its hypnotic vocals and mesmerizing tone, and its own slow build.  Panic Station is an over-the-top homage to Styx or other orchestral rock tracks to my ears, followed by Survival which is laugh-out-loud funny satire of a Gordon Gecko-like alpha male, dog-eat-dog kind of mentality set to music.<br /><br />The middle of the album gets a bit mushy, but only because those first few tracks are so outstanding - if not in immediate proximity they're quite fine listens.  Follow Me seems just a dad underpaced to me with drawn out vocals, as does Animals (although the latter track has some very nice musicality).  Explorers seems kind of forgetabble overall, and Big Freeze is kind of a dribbler of a double that I think was swinging for the fences.  But then the end of the album brings it all back.  Save Me starts out slow but grows on you, and Liquid State builds up to a powerful ending.<br /><br />And then we have the title track(s):  Unsustainable and Isolated Systems.  WOW.  The first one starts sounding like it should be backing music for the newest Batman trilogy - all rapid strings and dominating, brooding synth notes.  Then it overlays a technical voiceover that wouldn't be out of place backing some montage of Wayne working on his newest gadgetry...only to explode into a fully saturated electronically distorted barrage of sound which reminded me of Nine Inch Nails from the Downward Spiral phase, just far less angry.  The second one starts out a little more pensive than brooding, and brought to mind the movie Children of Men with the sort of despairing &#34;things are breaking down&#34; news-coverage vocal overlays.  This is the way the world ends - not with a bang, but a whimper.<br /><br />Muse really strikes me as a group that takes a lot of chances with vocal range and musical styles and classical, orchestral flourishes, and this album I think showcases them at their full potential.  If there's not a single track on this album you like, then you're likely dead inside, or only listen to Gregorian Chants or something.  What really makes me wonder though is this is called &#34;Disk 1&#34; by my music app....is there a Disk 2 I'm missing??? If so...I WANT IT!a bit mushy, but only because those first few tracks are so outstanding - if not in immediate proximity they're quite fine listens.

B00BSBVLF8|4.0|In some ways, this Cirque Du Soleil 'movie' is better than a live show. In a live show it is hard to watch everything that is going on because the shows are always so action packed. This movie, perhaps because it is watched on a TV screen seems easier to follow. It is just as magical and colorful as a live show, but without the immediacy and thrill.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to everyone -- especially those who are counting their pennies -- for the beauty and creativity of the Cirque Du Soleil experience.
B009PNQUXO|4.0|So I just downloaded this app and it is very hard to download. It keep saying &quot;not available&quot;. So confusing!!!!!!!!! I would give this app 3 and one half stars. But it is closer to 4 stars.
B008133MDK|5.0|I just finished rewatching this 2nd season in preparation for the forthcoming and long overdue third season. I don't know if the 3rd can top this one. It such a fabulously clever reinterpretation of the Holmes stories  my favorite is the \\"Hounds of Baskerville.\\"
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|The movies was fun to watch. It's a little dark but not scary. It shows the characters in a different light.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game that this review is about is awesome... I would totally recommend it to everyone who LOVES a challenge. There is a few glitches on the kindle that need to be fixed but other wise all you do is run from in a cop because you were vandalizing a train.
1401238580|3.0|I got a little disapointed with the mask quality, it's lower than looks like and easy to break.<br />The book is great, incredible story and the quality of the pages are nice!
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|recommend this book to anyone who loves little quirks, 80s nostalgia, awesome music, odd romances...this book has it all. Get it.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|i've followed this series from the beginning, and was shattered when Jordan died without completing his monumental life's work.  Thankfully, Brandon Sanderson has obviously lived, breathed and channeled the series, and he has my  thanks and admiration for bringing it to such a satisfactory close!
B00BIPCY14|4.0|It's all about protecting the good/ righting the wronged. It also has a bit of romance immersed throughout. Similar to Law & Order, but it mostly takes place in the courtroom. Every episode is Very different. Try to only watch the first 2 episodes....
B000Q8QH0I|5.0|This such a great movie, I had to get it on blu-ray.  The actors are all on point, and the casting is perfect, from the smallest role to the large ones.  Great action, great twists one of my all time favs.  And in blu-ray it looks great too.
0307887898|5.0|Highly Recommended to entrepreneurs who is at the initial phase of an startup.<br />Eric Ries is a smart guy who can see everything with a bird eye.
B0052SF6CM|5.0|18 Months is a great album I listen to all the time and it came at a great time and in the differential time!!!!!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is a great game to pass the time with. It's easy enough that even my 5yr old can play and collect coins for me.
B004XQYBA2|2.0|I can not remember why I did not like it. I think it was difficult to understand and I play Sudoku  a lot.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Love the show I had to watch all of the episodes again an I may watch it again. I hope it come back on again soon.
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|It was a easy notebook to use. I started writing in it but then I have not for  awhile. I
0061122416|5.0|A great read for any person on a journey to grow and experience. Your dreams and aspirations are yours and they are 100% attainable.
B007HLIUN4|2.0|The writer can spare about 300 pages and still saying the same thing.<br />The basic idea is promising, even though i think it is quite clear and not very deep.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is amazingly great I love it I do not find any bugs either I love this game so much this is probably the best
B005OYKI1I|2.0|I have seen plenty of shallow empty action movies, but rarely one with such a high budget and potentially competent lineup.<br />Meh...
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I literally have no words possible to come out of my mouth. I love the book... I love Kiera Cass... and I love America Singer.<br /><br />I<br /><3<br />America Singer

B00ACBN9CI|5.0|this is a great game!  great selection of aircraft. controls are precise. phantom series available!! awesome! get this game now!
B009NY43NY|3.0|This seemed to be pretty low quality and very anticlimactic. Very boring a disappointing. I wanted a lot more but whatever.
B00AFEY354|4.0|I enjoyed this movie and felt it had an important message.  The cast was very good and Emma Watson great.
B009GX69RK|5.0|This is one of the very few shows that my husband and I actually go out of our way to watch.  I could not pick a favorite character as they all meld together so well to make one half hour of hilarity.  I purchase them on line to watch again because we are laughing so hard we miss other funny dialogue.  I hope the show has a long run.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Superb movie.  The locations were perfect, the music is wonderful and the actor were great.  I saw it in the theatre and couldn't wait for it to come4 out in DVD.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|The only draw back to this calculator is that the software forces orientation of the user interface to be in portrait mode.  This may not be bothersome for some people, but for me I'd rather have the orientation stay in the same manner in which I activated the software.  Other than this, the application works just fine.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Of course having read all the other Wheel of Time books, it was a given I would be reading this too. I many ways you have to read it. Given the complexity of the story, the conclusion does a next job of tying up ends and pulling things together. There are a few surprises and they work well with the plot overall.<br /><br />However, I have to say it was a little dull with everything being about fighting. It just went on a bit.<br /><br />I did enjoy the book overall: it was a strong conclusion to the series and I would not have missed it for anything but there were parts I felt were somewhat dull.
0792163710|5.0|this was a Christmas present that was bought for a nephew of the same name sake.  he had this growing up and it was lost and i am so glad that i was able to find it and get it for him. amazing what can be found on Amazon.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Really enjoyed this book from an author I had not tried before. Found the story entertaining and it carried me along as I expect all good fantasy books to do. Will look out for more by this author.
B004MDLOQK|4.0|i cannot wait to read this book.  i love romantic stories. i will definitely read more. cannot wait. love the classics
B00B69UQEO|2.0|I just reviewed OMD's new release, and my critical opinion of DM's latest nearly mirrors that review. DM has released a mediocre, plodding record that doesn't carry a single hook or shred of sonic splendor. It's too bad 'cause they usually kick azz.
B000JQUGVI|4.0|i cannot wait to read this book.  i love romantic stories. i will definitely read more.  can never have too many classics in your repetoire(not sure if that is correct spelling).
B00BDSRKHO|2.0|I grew up with OMD, and have many memories and emotions tied up in their music. I very much looked forward to this release, and was encouraged by the mostly positive reviews. I'm truly disappointed as I feel this record is very one-dimensional and derivative to the extreme.
B00BQBNK04|5.0|I love both the movie and the soundtrack. The price is also very good considering the number of songs you get.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Start from here.  Read this and get the basics of what you need to get the ball rolling.  If you require more advanced help, there are other book sources that address that issue.  This is the jumping off point and it was helpful.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|FX takes on a fairy tale...no acting required.  I can't wait until we have the sequel of the Three Little Pigs & the Huntsman.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|I heard about this through a friend and then again through NPR. First I couldn't get &#34;Tesselate&#34; out of my head. This is one of the most complete albums I've heard in a while. It's the full package. Just let it play through, people.
193700788X|1.0|What to say about what will go down as one of the worst declines and fall of a once popular series? SVM is a study in what not to do. This saddens me. After watching the reviews, one thing I see is the continuation of the ridiculous Suitor Wars. Most of the 5 Star reviews come off as gushing Bill fans happy to gloat its not Eric, or worse yet... paid damage control from the publisher. People do make a living writing reviews, and the name of the game is selling books.<br /><br />Which brings me to Ms Harris. It's all about selling the books and money. Nothing wrong with that, but remember to respect the target market. Either you don't understand the genre you are writing for, or you played us all--Eric fans the worse. 65-70% of your fan base are Eric fans. We are not the \\"small\\" majority you claim. Check the percentage of 1 Star to 5 Star reviews if you don't believe me. We are all not nutcases out to hurt you (more damage control and deflection ??). 99.999% of us are/were your fans. Our upset is not about Eric being axed as HEA. It is about crushing his fandom with a 11th hour \\"bait and switch\\" while gutting the character with an almost \\"in your face\\" zeal. I know I am talking to the wall with some, but Sam is not the issue. Just like in the books, Sam is a non-entity. He is just there. Meh.<br /><br />This is not about Harris's right to write the series how she saw fit. It is all about her writing a series ending that made sense, was well thought out and entertaining, while treating the fandom with respect. Big fail to the majority.<br /><br />All of this has been said before... in many ways far better than me.<br /><br />13 years is a long time to wait for such a anti-climatic, hackneyed, hodge-podge plot. I am just glad its over. I will invest no more time in you.
B001MLCX56|1.0|B-rated for sure. Not much to think about in this movie. Not Wes Craven's best that is for sure! Sorry I rented it.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|Great songs and great vocals on every track.  NKOTB you are a true testament that you only get better with age!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I like the way this writer has many plot lines and I like his descriptions as well as his characters.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I luv this game. I got it at the Amazon app store for my kindle fire HD.u should get this game. It's better than temple run and temple run is on  of my faves!
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|Not nearly as exciting as Lord of the Rings. I rate as a rental unless you want to buy it to keep it with Lord Of The Rings Series.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I went through this book on my kindle fast  as I could change pages. One of the very best  I have ever read by this talented pair of authors.
B008VBYN80|4.0|its a fun game if you are boredbit you'll want to have a game loft account to play and neighbors to play
B003TSEEDY|5.0|But isn't it always?  I would much rather read a book than watch a movie any day. This was bought for my 13 year old daughter. She begged for it and devoured it when she got it.  She loved it and would recommend to others.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|It will keep your nose in the book! could not put the book down and did not guess the ending like a lot of them.
B00AQM8H9I|4.0|Very cute game. Good time killer while flexing your brain. Graphics are good. I would recommend. Would definitely buy again.
B00358ESI4|5.0|I have really enjoyed the movie.  As a fan of Mel Gibson, I thought he did a great job of portraying Gen. Hal Moore.
0307200477|5.0|I encountered this book in my kiddie literature class in college 35 years ago as a perfect starter book. It's still good today. I buy it frequently as a shower gift for baby. Love the tactile experience for the little ones. This book has passed the test of time.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|What can I say, the Big Bang Theory rocks!  I just love Sheldon!  He is so socially awkward and it never seems to both him at all.
B0076DELIG|4.0|fast moving , hard to put down. a masterpiece of good old fashion police work. highly recommended for michael connelly fans
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I was looking for a high-quality case with functional features, and this is it.  It is just heavy-duty enough to protect my tablet, and has every feature I could ask for.  I absolutely love the revolving mount feature, and the exterior of the case gives my tablet a truly luxurious look.  I couldn't ask for a better case, and I enthusiastically give this one 5 stars.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Keeps you wanting more, I couldn't hardly put it down. I can't wait to see what happens in the next book.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|The story of who, how and what it took to dig up this, what might have been, forever buried tale is incredible indeed.<br />But the story subject matter, SUGAR MAN is proof that the lost tales of truth and well earned wisdom are out there to be found. What a good and humble soul he is.
B00005JPUN|4.0|I received this movie in great time and it was in good shape. I will look forward to buying off of them again.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This is a really great film.  I have the trilogy and love this.  Am looking forward to the rest of this trilogy.
B000FVQLQQ|4.0|The movie was just exactly what I thought it was going to be it was light and entertaining enjoyed it very much.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I can't see the blocks very well.  Too small for me.  I am not enjoying it and will probably remove it soon.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|love all the honor Harrington books and I am very glad to get them all on the Kindle format now.
0131103628|5.0|Even if you already know the language, it is the best book to get reference on a specific subjet. Great.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Seems like the author just wanted to get the book done and over with. For the very last Sookie book, I'm disappointed.
B004YRSBTW|4.0|I can figure out how most movies are going to end up long before the conclusion, therefore I appreciate it when I can't. That's entertainment. This is one of those rare movies.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A Good Read I was in the Marine Corps for 22 years and yes also a Sniper, and this book is must for anyone who ever Served. He was a Great American and Sniper!!!
B00BI73CVI|3.0|It took me a while to get into it but it was a good story and well done by the cast. knowing my history before watching would have been helpful.
0393345084|5.0|Krugman writes so a lay person can understand whaqt is being said.  He provides a codified common sense approach to economics and should be widely read by senators and congresspersons as well as the President and cabinet.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|Good show but not great. The movie is just funny and feel good but not much else. I had higher expectations from this cast.
B001AMNL2Q|4.0|Full Metal Jacket is a movie about a U.S. Marine observing the dehumanizing effects the Vietnam War has on his fellow Marine recruits from their brutal boot camp training to the bloody street fighting set in 1968 in Hue, Vietnam.<br /><br />To me this is one the most intense war movies made especially with great boot camp scenes and gritty realistic war scenes. The first half of the movie is definitely the best part as the second slows a bit and seems to get off track but it is still a great film to watch again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book read the first and you'll be hooked. I`d recommend this book to anyone I know.  Great job on the suspense.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Bourne Legacy indicates alarming signs of formidable-sized  growing pains for this highly popular Bourne Series and its eminently resourceful  rebel-hero, Jason (still without his fellow-\\"Argonauts\\") portrayed by that masterfully proficient celebrated protagonist Matt Damon, whose valiant leading character is on the verge of a new evolutionary phase in the continuing encounter with a gargantuan malevolent species of CIA. Most crucial is the startling new role of an outstanding young woman super-scientist, the main Super-Soldier designer for the dire C.I.A. enterprise, vibrantly executed by Rachel Weisz.These fascinating new factors are working toward a futuristic conflict on a cosmic scale for the nature of life itself. There are even major mysterious points about absolute authority,and resisting women's potential, suggested through Legacy, like those raised in Scott's great Blade Runner(though bearing W.S.Burroughs' shady touch). However,eager anticipation of prodigious Bourne developments in sight(as her husband heartily agrees).
B008D36INE|1.0|If you enjoy watching a beautiful consumptive woman gazing mournfully out the window while taking histrionic drags on a cigarette for an hour and 38 minutes, then this movie is for you. Her selflessness and her lover's abuse are no fun to watch. The script is miserable. Rachel Weisz is a fine actress; this film simply gave her nothing to work with.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Great story of frustration, tenacity, and courage.  The first three quarters of the movie covers the struggle to find Bin Laden, the last part is more action packed.  I enjoyed all of it.
B00CL6GAD2|1.0|The movie moved too slow and led to boredom, thought the characters were mismatched, did not like Brad Pitts performance
B0091REZMW|4.0|Often times I find it confusing on what, beyond simply finding the objects, I'm supposed to do. Still I enjoy it
1594487154|5.0|The book is not only phenomenal in the way Pink makes the case why we ALL are in 'sales', but his creative use of the English language would make for a great English composition course.  We used this book in a very unique book club I run and his research case studies and exercises make for great discussion within smaller breakout groups we form.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|This book is amusing. THE book help me read . this book should  get a 5 star review comic like this book.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Loved this movie.  It had a great story that was true, and was inspiring. There is very brief nudity, due to clothes being damaged in the tragedy.  I thought it was family friendly had a positive message.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's very easy to navigate and pin my interests! I could use it for hours on my Kindle until it dies..
B004D23BRU|2.0|There's no spoken language, kids and adults bullying each other, the wolf grabs the duck by the neck and throws it in the air to swallow it whole, and no where during the film did it look to be a family or children's movie. It's something like claymation artsy put to classical music.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Is a really fun game and if you like a challenge then this game is for you. It is hard but not to hard this game takes patience it gets frustrating at times because it is hard.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I should preface this review by noting that I typically love Judd Apatow films, Leslie Mann, Paul Rudd--you get it. I rented this movie and couldn't even finish it. I was so bored (and partially terrified) that I decided to take a midday nap, rather than watch another minute of this disaster. 30 minutes and 1 star are both far too generous in this case.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|The iron man game is the best game available for the kindle fire and is one of the most awesome games  I have ever played<br /><br />This
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Great unit, very loud (except for the audible ding you hear when voice control is activated on iPhone.)  Holds a charge forever.  I've had it for two weeks and haven't charged it yet.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Best I've played so far in the hidden objects category.  Wish it was a bit more clear as to the meaning of some of the items found &amp; rewarded.  It would be nice if you could get diamonds for the game icons.  Can't wait to see the basement.
B0045HCJG2|4.0|This movie looks like it was but another really frantic effort by Sylvester Stallone to be artistic and theatric in making movies, but I guess this movie available in DVD format is worth a look.
B008MM9630|4.0|This is pretty fun! I must agree it's to bad you have to spend cash to complete a quest. Aside from that once you get going it's addictive.
0441172717|5.0|This book really starts up my imagination running wild. The four sequels are interesting too. I believe that these books are socialogically and psychiatrically sound too.
B009AMANBA|4.0|Daniel Day Lewis was,of course, very good, and there are several other good performances.  I read in the paper that Connecticut objected to being portrayed as opposing Amendment 13, when they actually supported it.
0767814037|5.0|great film one of the  classic westerns would reccommend for any one's library of western films or horses and cowboys
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Ole Tom hits the notes pretty well. Wandering samurai in the bleak modern landscape, finds unjustly wronged man, uses clever understanding of human nature to pluck out truth from the strands of deception-where is Charlie Chan when you need him? Nah, it's a good story, the characters, Pike, Cruise, Herzog, esp. Herzog play their parts a little larger than life so that the characters assume the dimension of archetype. Pike is the damsel in distress- a by the rules DA who doesn't understand that not everyone plays by the rules, Cruise as The Man Who Knows, carefully studying the trail of events until it leads him to the culprit No One Sees. Herzog, though, exudes genuine evil, exhorting his minion to commit an unspeakable act upon himself and when the minion cannot muster the strength. Well. You know the rest. All in all a good romp with Robert Duvall, you cannot, you must not, forget Robert Duvall in a minor role. But darn, does he deliver those lines as if he is the character he plays. They say casting is three fourths of good acting. Chunky performances, including the African American police officer.

B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|I'm a long time fan of J.R.R. Tolkien. I've read 'The Hobbit' several times and as a very short novel It really didn't require two movies. The Lord of the rings trilogy on paper was also just a trilogy on film, so I don't see why it wasn't the same on film. Long time fans wouldn't have been upset by a longer film which is what it would have taken to reach the conclusion. All in all it just appears to alter the continuity by, not just making it a prequel as opposed to making the hobbit first, but dividing it into two parts rather than one which I thought was rather uncool for those folks who haven't read the book. Just my two cents.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was my first Gillian Flynn book....it definitely won't be the last. I couldn't put it down. So many twists and turns
B008K8U13K|4.0|It's amazing game! Controls are hard but you'll get used to it. Only thing was when I went to see what time it was on my kindle,  the controls weren't there anymore.  I had to go to another game to get the controls back. Make sure you don't make the controls go away xD.

B008JFUO72|2.0|The premise of the trailer itself screams false advertising. Putting the fact that I wasn't a huge fan of the first two Iron Man movies to begin with: the second was infinitely more plausible and darker than the first. The problem is in this third entry - they refuse to go darker. The Mandarin becomes a Joker, you almost find yourself rooting for the villains and hoping that Stark will be out of commission. The action is decent but the mad genius brilliance of Tony Stark has nowhere to go. It can't go into the new suit because it is just a prototype, the old suits just don't have the same general kick as the Mach series and don't even get me started on the Iron Patriot or the apparently uselessness of Don Cheadle as Rhodes. Sadly no-one seems to care at all, I honestly got more of a kick out of watching the Thor 2 preview that preceded the movie rather than being able to really embrace this and for Marvel to let this slide, well there are no excuses except to say that they've used their 'we just needed to cut paychecks' card.

B003G8Y4QO|3.0|A new doctor and new companions.  Not the one I'd pick out of a stack, but it is still Doctor Who and the action is great and the special effects are way above par for the past.  Several past characters and villians come along for the ride.  It is definitely worth watching.
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|I thought this was such a wonderful movie, I seen it in theaters and I literally loved it. I recommend it to EVERYONE!
B009NY43NY|1.0|I read this book with no great expectation after the spoiler was revealed and at the end i was even more disappointed. Here why:<br /><br />It was boring, the story line were the same than the previous book (dead body that is find at Merlotte's, short kidnapping for exemple). It really lacks any imagination. Plus, it lacks any sense! the people who want to kill Sookie don't have any good reason for it or the plot to bring them to do it are ridiculous.<br /><br />What was great in the first book of this serie was that Sookie was investigating to solve the mystery of the book and it was great to see Sookie as a strong open mind intelligent women. But in this book, we don't see Sookie that way, and we don't see Sookie do anything to solve her own murder plot.<br /><br />I found that a lot of the thoughts of Sookie were very judgemental especially when she look a other women in respect of their apperance (Tara for exemple). It shocks me...<br /><br />It was great to think that Sookie was going to do great things in her futur after a hard childhood and a boring young adult life. Its kind of sad how its end... I am not sure that it was her dream to be part owner of a bar. It was kind of Sam give her partnership, but it was not really her decision. At the end it really feel like Sookie settled in the lazy easy solution that somebody put in her way. And now, we have to buy that its a great end to a serie of 13 books. I was expecting more, like Sookie being important in the world create by CH and not only in the small town of bon temps. But, for this it would have take some imagination left but there was not anymore.<br />There a lot of other things that were bad in this book: the writting, the filler stuff, sex scene(come on seals.... i was unconfortable to read it... and after that because it sure didn't fell like it, we must read a couple of time that it was the best sex ever...its childish) ....and so much more...<br />very disapointing<br /><br />Sorry for my bad english, i speak french...
B001AQT0RC|4.0|love jody foster and how this story unfolds. a signal starts the search for money, power,love and the search for a higher power among ourselvers and the stars.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Okay.  Lots of sex.  So redundancy is one problem.  I'm midway through and I think to myself just how many sex scenes can one describe without being repetitive?  Not as many as the author and editors of this endless story would think.  Sex is sex is sex, especially if everyone is so delightfully orgasmic there's no tension or bad scenes ever.  Just sex this way, that way, here there and everywhere.  Even in the dastardly Red Room of Pain, the sex is absolutely FABULOUS.<br /><br />Believe it or not, it's the story that's got me by the nads.  Christian a very interesting character - attractive, powerful and he has a good story.  Unfortunately Ana doesn't.  Between her lack of self awareness and confidence, plus her references to her gymnastically inclined inner goddesses and brooding alter egos, (and then there's the) lip biting and admiring gazes watching Christian move about a room, she's a sort of one note song.  Not much changes for her - she doesn't listen to what he says, doesn't seem to get him but is madly in love with him.  He on the other hand, DOES listen to her and make radical changes.  So leave it to her to be entirely oblivious to what this might mean.  duh.<br /><br />SPOILER: I am midway through so there's a former sub/girlfriend floating around wearing an old trench coat and dirty suicide bandages who just happens to have gotten hereself a brand new gun permit, so she's very possibly gone psycho rogue and Christian is moving heaven and earth to protect his beloved from her possible jealous wrath.  We're not seeing nearly enough of the nut but we do hear quite a bit about how worried he is.  I think this is probably because a good psychotic character would make this endless sex fest an actual book and I think the writer isn't up to writing something like that, because it might complicate her very simple storyline:<br /><br />Christian is so achingly beautiful and damaged and he worries and when he does becomes overbearing, overprotective and demanding.<br />Ana storms about whereever she is posturing and disobeying and behaving like a ten year old.<br />They fight, make up, have amazing sex and then cuddle lovingly for five pages.<br />In the midst of it they have a conversation where she whips him with her snark and he loves it.<br />Then something happens to make Christian worried again, so he becomes overbearing, etc etc etc and the circle continues.<br /><br />I do hope book three is better than this.<br /><br />Frankly I'm still hoping crazy ex will turn out to be really good and really truly nuts and we can have a few less pages of turgid organs and tongues and teeth going this way and that and a few pages of some good old American crazytown.<br /><br />This book is very very Brit though, I can smell the bangers and mash in the background. gah.g.<br />Ana storms about whereever she is posturing and disobeying and behaving like a ten year old.<br />They fight, make up, have amazing sex and then cuddle lovingly for five pages.<br />In the midst of it they have a conversation where she whips him with her snark and he loves it.<br />Then something happens to make Christian worried again, so he becomes overbearing, etc etc etc and the circle continues.<br /><br />I do hope book three is better than this.<br /><br />Frankly I'm still hoping crazy ex will turn out to be really good and really truly nuts and we can have a few less pages of turgid organs and tongues and teeth going this way and that and a few pages of some good old American crazytown.<br /><br />This book is very very Brit though, I can smell the bangers and mash in the background. gah.

B00A81MV3U|3.0|Everything about the movie is average, the screenwriting, the casting, the performances.  Cooper is a good actor, but he's not great, and wasn't able to bring any nuance to the roll.  The story is hollywood, cliched, contrived, and feel good at the end. Also the whole Eagles \\"signals\\" thing was pretty tired and overworked.  I never felt these were real characters, I never felt any chemistry.  I really didn't learn anything about them, aside from some spoken exposition that wasn't convincing.  Sometimes when you fall to the 3rd and 4th choices for leads serendipity happens, but there's nothing special or any \\"stars aligning\\" for this movie. 3 stars

NOBODY DOES IT BETTER. Master John is a living cultural treasure. Correct, a LIVING CULTURAL TREASURE.<br /><br />If the UK does not put his face on a postage stamp tomorrow then I'm flying to London to throw Pounds at small-minded clerks until they do. I'll look up their skirts and pop their myths and chill their beer. Hell, I'll send smoke-signals to the Queen and infuriate her lil dogs.<br /><br />When I took an easy chair and opened Mr. Le Carre's new book, I gave my credit card to my kids and said Order Pizza and LEAVE ME ALONE. After midnight I warmed up cold pizza and wrote this review.  I don't care what they do to me tomorrow, Dr. John has given me insight into how to handle it.<br /><br />LONG LIVE THE MASTER.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I had to get used to the way the story was written - in diary form.  It just seemed weak at points and was beginning to lose me.  I did like the ending though!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Wow. That was the first word that came to mind when the end credits rolled. Sam Mendes did a wonderful job directing. The action is well done and even the scenes that don't have are beautiful to look at. I loved how he used blue, gray and other somber colors in certain scenes.<br /><br />A solid script really builds a good foundation for film and Skyfall had one. It was more personal when it came to Bond and M. Their storyline and Silva's had me fully engaged. There some bits of humor that I liked. I also enjoyed them reintroducing characters that we hadn't seen in Craig's Bond yet.<br /><br />The cast really brought their A game and Craig really showed different sides to Bond that didn't I expect. Judi Dench was a gem. Bardem was a truly sick and kind of sad SOB. There should have been more Naomie Harris and Q. Although there wasn't much to Berenice Marlohe's character, she still did fine with it.<br /><br />See it...unless you want something cheesy and light then don't bother.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved how this book wound it's way through the troubled beginnings of a young man and how you can read how his life actually changes throughout the book.  I almost put it down considering it &#34;a little too much information!&#34;, but perservered and was glad I did as you become very involved in the characters and you want to know how they end up.  Of course, the author cleverly leaves you hanging at the end of book 1, so you have to read on to find how what happens all the way through book 3.

Which is not in the original Samsung cover.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|For me this was the best of the three books.  I absolutely LOVED the middle of the story, which is sort of weird.  Most people love the beginning or the end, but for me this was where the story got interesting.  For me trilogies have been mostly misses, but this one was pretty decent.  Not to mention this is the story that brought me back to reading full time again.  So it has a special place in my heart.<br /><br />We see a very different side to both Ana and Christian in this book.  Ana seems to have grown up a little and  understands that sometimes you can't fix what's broken in someone else.  Not that our sweet girl doesn't keep trying, she does, she is just more aware that she can't fix everything.  After the way the first book ended, it was pretty painful to see where our heroine ended up.  She was devastated and alone.  It made your heart hurt thinking about how she had to go through essentially her first heartbreak without even having her best friend there.<br /><br />Christian is very different in this book as well.  He starts to realize that sometimes loving someone is worth the risk of getting hurt.  He let Ana slip through his fingers the last time we saw him, and he will be damned if he allows it again!  He needs Ana's innocence in order to move forward with his life and to heal.  We see a lot of demons come to the surface with Christian here.  And we see someone from his past trying desperately to ruin his present and possible future.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book is when Christian has gone missing and you see how much he is loved.  Not just by Ana, but by his family as well.  Something that even surprises him when he gets back.  I found that moment when he returns, to be the most precious of all three books.  Not because of the connection so much as the emotion he never allowed himself to feel.  He is very distant with his family, and with Ana at his side, he seems to let them in a little more.  He is able to open up to them a bit.<br /><br />Ana's new job is interesting and of course Christian steps in and causes a bit of chaos, but in the end it all works out.  Her new boss however, is creepy as hell.  We see him trying to trap Ana in a sexual relationship because he feels she owes him.  We see more on this creepy bastard in the third book.  And Christian has his own creepy relationship with his mother's friend Elena Lincoln, who quite frankly used Christian.  She was way too old for him, and preyed upon a teenage kid who was vulnerable.<br /><br />There is also a former submissive of Christian's that comes and makes life very difficult.  And although Ana does come across as jealous and angry, I understood completely.  I wanted to hit Christian more than once myself.<br /><br />This really was my favorite in the trilogy.  I felt like there was a ton of story told in this book.  I highly recommend it.  I give it 5 lipsticks!/>Ana's new job is interesting and of course Christian steps in and causes a bit of chaos, but in the end it all works out.  Her new boss however, is creepy as hell.

B00C7L4QB4|5.0|So far its very well done. The acting is first rate. The blocking in the shots is some of the best i have seen. The story is both disturbing and interesting ( but come on were talking about Hannibal here of course its disturbing! ) This is a quality show, but if you dont like graphic violence dont watch. Personally I think id watch it just because the acting is so good. ( praise for the dialogue as well, nice job writers. ) This is not a show for kids. ( there was a seen in one episode that i found disturbing and I grew up on scary movies.) So all in all if you like psychological thrillers you will probably like this.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I purchased my first G13 about 3 years ago and fell in love with it so when I accidentally spilled some milk all over it (ya, I know, I know)...I had to get the same one.  It's very sturdy and won't move around on you when pressing the keys.  The keys themselves offer a little resistance...a little more than a standard keyboard does.  At least that's what I've noticed with the two G13s I've owned.  The software is really well done for rebinding any key to any position and even has a joystick that can be bound to different keys.  Some of the keys are quite a long reach...mainly the lower thumb button but with so many other keys available this rarely causes any issues.  Macros are easily made and the programming language isn't hard to pick up with some practice.  And, the LCD gives you many options on what you want to see.  Whether that be gaming related cooldowns or VOIP specific information.  It does more that even I have figured out.  Really, if you need to rebind your keys, create custom macros and also need a visual representation of what you want or need to do (LCD display)...this is the board you need.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I am sad to say goodbye to Sookie and was looking forward to the series to ending with a bang. Even though I was a little disappointed with how it wrapped up, I will continue to claim the series as one of my favorites. The characters are full of life (even the dead ones) and so much fun to read about.
B001DF68MA|5.0|This is excellent. I think it's safer as they are on the front so if you happen to fall at least you can catch them.

B00COGZ8FU|2.0|When renting this movie, I expected it to be an action film, as the trailer would lead us to believe. However, it was more of a murder mystery/thriller...with a couple of action sequices. At times, the film felt rushed, and predictable. It wasn't a terrible film, with a few good lines and fight seens, but this won't be on Toms resume..
B008J34466|5.0|this is one of my all time favorite artists.  this has to be one of my most favorite albums.  i will probably buy her next one as well.
B004S5C91Q|5.0|Gorgeous and heartbreaking - little jack is a character that will stay with you forever. Highly recommended, not an ounce of gratuitous sex or violence and zero sensationalism which would have been so easy to lean on to create  a page turner, which this book most definitely is.

B004KSQN7C|5.0|I have loved Britney's music for some time now and I decided to buy a CD by her. This album is the best ever! I loved It! The deluxe edition offered me some great things! I got a pamphlet with pics of Britney and also extra tracks on the album! I still listen to it! Sometimes I would even turn up the volume to max and jump and dance around! This CD was one of the best ones I have ever bought! I am a music lover of all types of music but I usually am not a CD person like I don't buy many CDs but I'm glad I have this one! I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves pop and dance music!
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|I used to like Tom Cruise until I saw this movie.  We couldn't even watch the entire thing.  Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is painfully egotistical and it doesn't seem like this is of any benefit to the movie.  I couldn't spend 5 minutes in the same room with Jack Reacher.  I certainly don't want to spend 2 hours watching a movie that features such a pompous idiot.

034580404X|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone who thinks that they do not like to read. All of the books grab you (after the first chapter of the first book which is really slow to start) and you cannot put them down. However, this is definitely  for adults only. I think some men would enjoy it as well (I got some of my male friends to start reading and they couldn't put it down either). I would say that having an open mind would be good while reading this. This is a good book to start you in the erotica genre.
0062238868|5.0|I don't have much to say because I'm still reading it ;)<br /><br />However, I would have to say I'm loving this book. Chris is very blunt and to the point. Even though this book is an autobiography on Chris Kyle the &#34;American Sniper&#34;, I feel as if Chris is just like any of the rest of us. The only difference is that he didn't give up on himself.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Battery arrived sooner than expected, and though bulky, works perfectly. Since, with batteries , size matters, I expected the battery to be somewhat bulky, but the description of the unit was right on, it was as expected. Since it was being used for a Galaxy S3, a power hog, especially when used as a toy, the additional battery life more than compensates for the size. This was a perfect purchase, and the unit looks as good as it performs. I am quite pleased.  Ray
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game lot's of fun,cool graphics ,makes you think I would recommend this game to everyone who enjoys a great mind game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is pretty good I just wish i it would not be so hard kinda I like it though no I love it no I like it I love it I won't some . More of it.I just . Love it it is great
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game outruns temple run and other games it is so addicting and the keys are a good add on because when I die i can have more than 1 chance to keep going to get a highscore.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Have to agree with the other posters. Readers already figured that Eric would decamp to Oklahoma & Sookie would wind up with Sam just from the last book. However, everything else just seemed kind of hastily thrown together--like recipe ingredients you're not sure of. I realize that with the last book of any series there's a greater expectation, but can't help but feel a bit cheated in a way.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|The game can be scary. But then you get used to it after the first couple of times. :(  The game other wise is very fun. I think there should be more of a story, but you have to think it is only 99 cents!
B0011ZVVOM|4.0|For $5 this is the best album value I've gotten in a long time. Te Black Keys set the bar for this new genre,  as far as I am concerned they are one of the best new bands to break out recently.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun and addicting. It is good for all ages. You will never want to put it down.
B009MF5BXK|4.0|The title says it all.  The movie was more satisfying than the first.  Even Sly admits it in one of the documentaries that come with the DVD.  I rarely check out the extras on a DVD because it is usually some mumbling (commentary) during the movie.  However the docs on weapons, 80's action movies, and putting the film together are engaging and worth checking out.<br />I hope there will be a third movie where they pass the torch to younger stars to carry on the franchise.
B009T3AE1Y|2.0|\\"Cosmopolis\\" is directed by someone who has made such films as \\"Naked Lunch,\\" \\"Crash\\" and \\"Spider.\\" It is not very surprising that David Cronenberg turned a Don DeLillo novel into a film. Here, with a unique cast including Robert Pattinson, Juliette Binoche, Paul Giamatti and Samantha Morton, Cronenberg once again seems to have proved an age old theory: novel and film are two completely different media.<br /><br />Meet a young billionaire Eric Packer (Robert Pattinson) in a stretch limo, impervious to the chaos in the street. In \\"Cosmopolis,\\" however, the \\"story\\" means almost nothing. This is an allegory told in the coldest manner possible. What really matters is the dialogue, or the stream of dialogue, that is fast, dense and near impenetrable.<br /><br />In book you can stop and re-read (or just read on and come back later). In film you just can't, which is frustrating and sleep-inducing. One character does a violent thing with a gun, and I believe it has some meaning (perhaps related to his reason for being) even though on screen graphic violence just overshadows it. After all \\"Cosmopolis\\" as a film is so self-absorbed, unwilling or unable to communicate with us, unless, of course, you are willing to repeat watching ... just like when reading.<br /><br />In short, for all the strong performances from the players (especially from Pattinson and Giamatti) I don't see the point of making a film \\"Cosmopolis\\" in this way.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|A touching story about marriage. About love lost and regained. Starts off a bit boring but has a feel good endingvv
0307895475|5.0|Great guide, includes a huge map with the markers for everything on it. Great guide for anyone who loves Skyrim and wants almost everything.
B0080CKGZE|2.0|Robert P is of course, gorgeous in this, but the movie is not that great.  Parts are hard to follow and lacking luster.  Strange choices for female characters who don't seem to fit the era.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|My daughter read this book and said it was amazing and she didn't regret one time reading that amazing book!
B00APUYN0I|4.0|This is great for good laugh.  Rumour Wilson makes the movie with her comedic timing and wit.  Recommend to Glee lovers and lovers of goofy comedy.
B009EEQMZK|3.0|It kinda skimmed through the book like the movies &#34;Avatar The Last Airbender&#34; hmm hmmm hmm hmmm hmmmh mm h
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is AWESOME. Its all about creativity and letting your mind explore. It's really fun too. There are two modes survival and creative. In creative you have unlimited resources and can fly. But in survival, you have to hunt for resources and protect yourself from monsters. Have fun!!
B006RXSM9A|5.0|We just finished seeing the show in NYC so it was fresh in our minds. We think this was an excellent movie depiction and loved how they incorporated the actual show.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is a fun game that teaches kids that it is good to help animals and what a animal reserve is and how it is done. I love this game and I hope you do too!  :-)
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I need sound in order to sleep.  This is the best free app out there..<br />And trust me...I've tried several.
B0063IH60K|4.0|One of the best solitary games I have played and I have played a lot of them in my 65 years
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|A real jewel, for once the reviewers and award ppl had it right,  fun, quirky, laugh and cry. everyone at work is talking about it
B00C2VGAW2|5.0|Great Soundtrack! A great use of modern music to capture the spirit of a period piece. Typical of a Luhrmann production
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Great movies are hard to find and this one is very good.  It features a well written story line and the acting is just superb.  Jennifer Lawrence is just a knockout in this film and she proves her talent while playing an emotionally disturbed woman.  The other main character is Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) who is a mentally disturbed young man who is suffering from the loss of his adulterous wife. Together they find happiness in each other's arms after overcoming their own emotional and mental issues.<br /><br />This film is funny, sad, emotional and entertaining.  It is an all-star cast that adds to the entire enjoyment of the film and it is a movie worth seeing.  If you are a Jennifer Lawrence fan then this movie will just be totally fun for you.  Her role is sultry and sad at the same time and her talent really shines.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|I loved the interaction between the two main characters.  They are divorced but have a very amicable relationship as it pertains to their daughter.
B005FLX1KK|5.0|I ordered this record on may 7th on it got here on the 10th even though it said that it would be here on the 13th, which needless to say is awesome!!! As i opened the record sleeve itself, a piece of paper fell out saying that i could get the whole album for free since i bought the vinyl album. The record itself was in great condition.  i couldnt be happier. thanks!!
B005LAIHYU|4.0|The title leads you to believe this would be the stupidest of movies. And I an not a Tim Burton fan. However, I really enjoyed this movie. Lots of action. Great visuals. And interesting twists on historical events. I think this movie got a bad rap from the major critics. Without a doubt well worth your time and money. Enjoy!
B005KAH7QU|5.0|I just wish there were more stars. Amazing actors. Amazing movie. I wish I hadn't waited so long to watch it.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|Not my king\d of movie. Did'nt care for the plot and the brutality. Waste of my time and certainly did'nt feel good after watching
B00004TT89|1.0|I received the DVD and was excited until I tried to play it and its not set up for the US region. Major rip off now they won't let me return.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|story was slow.... not  enough usual gadgets, cars... a lot different from the usual bond flicks.  enjoyed watching Daniel Craig
B00C5ZORES|5.0|Was so surprised at how much I like this album!  I find myself listening to it over and over again.
B0000039QA|5.0|This double CD is one of the best in rap history. Biggie is a legend whose work is still relevant, and some would say even better than most hip hop on the radio today.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|This 3D movie can't truly be enjoyed in any other format for me. It is absolutely stunning. The price was good, the shipping was good, and I am pleades with the product.
B0016BWACI|5.0|I love this movie. it is my favorite movie. it shows what people can do without a lot of computer animation. my granddaughter who just gave me my great grandbaby watched it all the time with me and it brings back fun times we had together. I am looking forward to haveing great times with my great grandson watching this the dark crystal
B008NEMN0K|4.0|The 3D Diszk is great! It only contained the 3D Disk and a regular video player disk. No regular Blu-ray disk or scenes disk.
B001VLXNO2|4.0|A great story well told in Jeffrey Archer's inimitable style. Although not usually a fan for biographies this one is captivating.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|I totally missed Fringe while it was on television . I'm glad I'm watching it now! I can't wait it view seasons four and five!
B007REV4YI|3.0|It is a decent movie and the twist and plot lines aren't difficult to follow.  Unfortunately, I didn't really feel that villain was that evil.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I love this game you can do so much stuff like build mine level up do missions for people get experience craft fight and that stuff they have lots of armour and weapons the graphics are great they have stuff Minecraft doesn't have they have lots of monster to you should get this game the thing it needs tho is more animals
B009EEFTMC|2.0|I played it about 3 or 4 times but just not my type of game.  Should be more levels and different layouts
B008XCJ03K|5.0|I just heard about Passenger.  Fell in love with this CD and play it all the time.  Recommend it to all folk/indie lovers.
B00BN3EE1O|2.0|I was in a chick flick mood, and after reading reviews about a \\"surprise\\" ending, I was excited about seeing \\"Safe Haven.\\" Although pretty predictable up until the end, I really liked the film... until the \\"surprise\\" ending, which I would label more \\"ridiculous\\" than surprising. Without the ending, this could have been a film that I would have purchased and watched over and over on those rainy days where I just wanted to veg out to a \\"feel good\\" movie. Instead, the ending destroyed the rest of the movie for me. Seriously? What the heck was that?
0064430170|5.0|This is a great story with beautiful illustrations. I purchased this as a gift/decor for a friends baby shower and it was a big hit! It definitely brought back tons of memories for moms and a few inner kids as well.
0345529057|5.0|already in the 4th book. Amazing value and well worth the price. brand new exactly as described. i would recommend to others
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I am a reader and always have a few books with me either in digital format or hard copy. I believe Jane is a must for any book lovers library.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It was great! Can't wait for season 4! Was upset by the ending of the final show. Shocked and an uneasy way to end the season.

B00AJAFNIA|5.0|This game is Awesome! The producers of this game should be proud of themselves. It's colorful and reactive w/ great sound! Couldn't be more fun to play. Excellent Game!!
B009KEN87O|5.0|I &quot;purchased&quot; this game when it was the faotd. I've played it a great deal. Thank you Amazon for something worth while finally. Mix of several old school games combined into one fun game.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Don't like that I have to set up an account. Want to play alone. Canceled the game. Will find a game that won't make you spend money on something that is free.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|This book was is very predictable.  It lacks any real substance.  It was difficult for me to even finish the book,
B007EDYN36|3.0|The book was fantastic, honest, sad and joyful all rolled together.  But the format on several pages was incorrect and had a foreign language so I missed a lot...  hopefully the publisher can fix the errors.<br /><br />I recommend this book for any Peter fan.<br /><br />Gene and Paul fans won't like it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I titled this review as I did because this is not a cookie-cutter New Adult read. It's so much more.<br /><br />Hopeless is an important book, tackling traumatic issues that happen to people in real life. Just as young women turned to Are You There God, It's Me Margaret? for help with issues of growing up, I see women of all ages turning to Hopeless as a balm and healing read for serious emotional trauma and the hopelessness they may feel because of it.<br /><br />The characters were lovable and real. The story was sensual, yet substantive as well. I felt myself swooning in all the right places and feeling tension right along with the characters during the disturbing parts, which the author did not shy away from. Colleen Hoover crafted a well-written work. While I surmised early on what the main problem with Sky was, there was plenty of surprise in its revelation and twists in the details that kept me turning the pages, eager for more. I truly enjoyed this story and recommend to others.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|I don't see any problems with it!<br />·Great graphics<br />·Good concept<br />·Many ways to play!<br /><br />PROS: everything :-)<br />CONS: nothing :-)<br /><br />I recommend this game to anybody!!!
B000FC1MCS|5.0|The story is from a very different perspective,a young boy with aspergers,very intelligent,but with some quirky symptoms,I have enjoyed it very much&glad I read it!!!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is the bomb!!you can breed tons of dragons it updates a lot and its easy.I recommend this app for everyone.
1400069742|4.0|Those Angry Days<br /><br />By Lynne Olson<br /><br />Book Review<br /><br />By Richard Edward Noble<br /><br />The more I read history books the more I realize there are no unbiased historians. Every historian has his or her point of view.<br /><br />I suppose this could be extended to cover all writers in all venues. Every writer has his sticking points.<br /><br />Lynne Olson leans to the right in many of her interpretations of historical events but not to such a degree that I was turned off by most of what she had to say.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this book. It contained lots of information and from a point of view I always find different.<br />Lynne is a female and that alone changes the perspective somewhat.<br /><br />Lots of insights, for example, into the life and personality of Anne Morrow Lindbergh.<br /><br />The title of the book, \\"Those Angry Days\\" could lead one to suspect that this book is written about our current political circumstance.<br /><br />But it is not.<br /><br />This book is about another period of angry days here in America - and we have had many such periods and times.<br /><br />In fact, it does seem upon investigation the descriptive phrase, \\"Those Angry Days,\\" could be used to describe just about any period in the history of the United States.<br /><br />We are always angry and always have been angry.<br /><br />But this book covers those angry days between 1939 and 1941 leading up to the bombing of Pearl Harbor and U.S. entry into World War II.<br /><br />The main focus is on the lives of Franklin Roosevelt and Charles Lindbergh and their families, friends, rivals and supporters.<br /><br />Along the way we bump into presidential challengers, cabinet members and power moguls of one type or another.<br /><br />Lindbergh was one of FDR's biggest critics and leader of the \\"America First Committee.\\"<br /><br />When talking about Franklin Roosevelt and Charles Lindbergh there are always two questions that come up: Was Roosevelt a socialist and was Lindbergh a Nazi.<br /><br />I would say that Franklin Roosevelt was a socialist - but a democratic socialist and not a communist or totalitarian socialist.<br /><br />Like Albert Einstein and many other famous people, I consider democratic socialism a good thing. Consequently I have very little problem liking and supporting Franklin Roosevelt and his brand of socialism.<br /><br />Whenever I find myself criticizing FDR, it is for those times in his long career when he chose to support big business and the power mongers over the people. Most conservatives criticize Roosevelt for the exact opposite of what I praise him for. They support moneyed interests over people's interests.<br /><br />In defense of Lindbergh, most will bring up the fact that he was not a card carrying member of the German or the American Nazi Party.<br /><br />This I accept as fact.<br /><br />But this does not mean that he was a pure isolationist or a pacifist intent on saving American lives in another foreign war and that his sympathies and heart was not Nazi inclined.<br /><br />Lindbergh was not a pacifist in any way shape or form. So any defense of his anti-war resistance status would have to be based on the notion that he was an isolationist rather than a Nazi supporter.<br /><br />The argument would be that he was just another in a long line of opposition against the war mongering Roosevelt and not pro-Hitler or anti-Jew or pro-Nazi.<br /><br />The author picks up on this theme and throughout the book placates the pro-Nazi notion.<br /><br />I have never been convinced.<br /><br />But it seems to this reader that the author does her best to make this extremely bigoted and dominant man into a main stream patriotic, straightforward isolationist.<br /><br />Once again, I have never been convinced.<br /><br />At the end of the book the author reveals something about Lindberg that I never knew.<br /><br />It seems that Lindberg not only led three secret lives but four.<br /><br/>After the war Lindbergh established a small German harem. Beside his little, loveable, sensitive Anne Morrow Lindbergh suffering and struggling along with her six kids back home in America, visiting one psychiatrist after another and alienating her own family, Charles also has German mistresses each of whom were busy raising two more Lindbergh children. And none of these woman were aware of their lover's other relationships.<br /><br />This, of course, has nothing to do with this man's possible Nazi sympathies but the clandestine, immorality and quadruple deception does lend credence to the notion that this man is of a deceptive character lacking in conscience and devoid of sincerity and loyalty.<br /><br />Having a bad character, lacking in moral conscience, insincerity and demanding loyalty of others while not practicing this virtue yourself, are a few of the main building blocks in the Nazi personality.<br /><br />When we add this to all the other personality flaws, his German medals and his love of discipline, order and ridged planning, it takes very little imagination to push this guy over the cliff and into the pit of Nazi thinking.<br /><br />I agree with Roosevelt on this one also. I too am convinced that Lindbergh was a Nazi.<br /><br />The author introduces us to a host of other interesting political characters and events.<br />Though I found much to disagree with and question, the author drew me back again and again.<br />I found the book compelling, interesting though often debatable./>After the war Lindbergh established a small German harem.

193700788X|1.0|This ending would've been perfect at book 4 or 5 or even 6. This book was nothing but rehashing tired, old plotlines that never went anywhere and beat dead horses while running around the bush so the cash cow could be milked a little longer. I will never again purchase anything Charlaine Harris has ever written.<br /><br />ALTERNATE REC LIST:<br />Sisters of the Moon/Otherworld by Yasmine Galenorn<br />Kate Daniels by Ilona Andrews<br />Merry Gentry by Laurell K.

B004LROUNG|5.0|Fun Grisham book with likable main character. Plot twists not easily guessed. If you like court drama you will enjoy.
B008PWUYVA|3.0|the closure tab, velcro stuff, started coming off from the beginning.  Need to make this much more secure.  It's just OK.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I wasn't surprised by relationship that ended the Sookie Stackhouse series. This has, despite the distractions of characters and plots, been about a woman discovering herself. When we met Sookie she was alone, save for a select few people, and living in a very small world. Like Dorothy dropped in Kansas, she explored territory unfamiliar and threatening. In the closing page, Sookie says &#34;I belong here&#34; in much the way Dorothy realized there was no place like home. The Sookie of the first book, the Sookie who looked for other people to value her, has become a woman who values herself. While the novel is overly cluttered at times and suffers from the usual complaints I have with Harris's style it did not disappoint me. Harris was wise to close the series the way she did and with the message she did. Sookie was always enough, she just needed to see it.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This book is good and I think that everyone should read it. Also the other books in the series are good
B00BUCXVPI|5.0|Rarely do I enjoy a movie as much as the book - the movie just can't get the same character development and all the details that a book does.  Jack Reacher does as good a job of it as I've seen.  Obviously, one enjoys this movie more if he's read the book.  Highly recommend.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is another book on the forgotten history of our nation. It is chilling to think that this has happened to children. But hearing their stories of overcoming the hardship's in their life is amazing!<br />  WE must all remember what have been given so that we can have the country we live in
B006POGWHK|1.0|I sent it to my 86-year-old mother for Mother's Day and it would not play at all in the DVD machine that she always plays other DVDs on:( My father returned it. I'd really like her to see the DVD, but I don't know if I want to chance sending another copy.<br /><br />The delivery was timely and everything else was fine.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun and addictive. I have it on all my devices. The color contrast makes the game very easy to see and navigate. Have fun!
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|It is very nice set. Discs , book, music box, quality of movie, music, extras all are very good. Worth to buy.
B000YCLRBA|5.0|This is a stunning production and Fleming and Hvorostovsky are perfect. I think it is one of the best opera DVD's available.

B00006L9ZT|5.0|Although I do not hate the Met's new Ring Cycle and I think Jay Hunter Morris in the new production is a better Siegfried than Jerusalem in this production, I slightly prefer the costuming and staging of this production. I also prefer James Morris and Mattie Salminen in this production.

B00COHAUD4|3.0|This movie was as ridiculous as the animated ghost that had me rolling on the floor. My kids were  disappointed because this movie was not scary enough to even keep them on the edge of there seats.
B0045XGRQE|5.0|Love his funny wit. They picked the perfect guy to play Iron Man. Fun to see him kick butt. Like the romance part too.

B0074PNCRM|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! Although there is the tragedy of loss there is also this side of comedy that's kind of up lifting. I didn't find myself crying like would have expected but felt the loss in a different way. A nice light read given the subject matter

B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|This album has so many songs that will become instant favorites! The catchy tunes, the moving lyrics and the pure genius musicality of the musicians make this a great return for Rod. His voice sounds a good as ever.
B008J34466|5.0|Even if you've never heard Pink before this album will cause you to fall for her style of raspy singing. Some songs do earn the explicit warming but nothing offensive for mature ears. Definitely her best album yet!

B009LMTDL0|3.0|I bought this book after hearing the keynote speaker of a local women's group quote several of the key concepts,always giving full credit to the author.<br /><br />I was somewhat disappointed at the autobiographical tone of the book. At times I found myself skipping several pages ahead to try and find nuggets of motivation and wisdom.

B00ADR2DTG|5.0|You know, sometimes I spend too much time researching a purchase. This was one of those times. I had made the mistake of buying an underpowered Fiio e6, and I regretted it. So I decided to invest some time in figuring out what would be a better headphone amp. Well, some might say anything is better than a Fiio e6, and I would agree with you. But I had some specific requirements. I wanted a nice sounding amp for work. It had to have some power behind it. It had to be inexpensive in case someone walked off with it. I didn't care what it looked like. I saw other tube amps and thought, yes, maybe later, and definitely not for work. But then I spotted this little guy. Then I went to head-fi.org and found more information than I wanted about this little guy. It's got a tube, yes, but it's a hybrid amp, meaning it's also got some solid state stuff inline. Ok, but it's still Class A.<br /><br />Two weeks after running it all day at work, it has burned in some (yes, burn in is real, at least for tubes). I'm running ATH M40's (not the best, but good), and I tell you what: this thing rocks. Yes. It rocks. I guess you can find better amps, cleaner amps, amps with more tubes, or amps with no tubes. But this thing gives you a little of both worlds, and to my ears it is exciting, clean, and fun. I have cried listening to some of my music with this little thing. I'm listening to it as I write this. For 70 bucks, you can't beat it. It's just that good. Yeah. Definitely recommended.<br /><br />Update June 2014: After more than a year of using this amplifier, it is still going strong. I use a [[ASIN:B00080G0BK Thermaltake Mobile Fan II External USB Cooling Fan - Us]] to cool the unit, which I believe helps extend its life (the heat sinks do get hot). I've long ago discarded the stock tube, and tried a whole lot of different 12AU7 vintage tubes purchased from auction websites (which have proven to be superior to the stock tube). I have tried other, better headphones than those mentioned in my original review, and this amp drives higher impedance cans with ease.<br /><br />Is it a giant killer? No. There are better tube amps (the [[ASIN:B00HAOSDOO Vali Subminiature Hybrid Headphone Amplifier]] is a better hybrid amp, and it's made in the USA). But this amp represents something significant: it is the least expensive hybrid amp (meaning, tube and solid state) that you can buy, that really sounds good, and can drive lots of different headphones with ease. It also permits \\"tube rolling\\", which means you can exchange tubes easily just by turning it off and plugging in a new tube. You can use 12AU7, or 5963 tubes, 5814 tubes, or 6189 tubes as well (some can be purchased for well under $10). Visit head-fi.org and search for the discussions regarding this amp for more details.<br /><br />It has its flaws, but they are harder to find than you might think. The price has dropped $8 or so since I bought mine, so it's an even better deal than it used to be.<br /><br />If you want a cool looking budget amplifier that can be driven by an ipod alone, or by a DAC, or a CD player, then this is an excellent choice. I highly recommend tossing the standard tube, and purchasing a vintage 12AU7 from an auction website (skip the new tubes, they just don't sound as good).<br /><br />If you aren't on a restricted budget or prefer something Made in the USA, take a look at the Schiit Vali mentioned above.d in my original review, and this amp drives higher impedance cans with ease.<br /><br />Is it a giant killer?

B009UAO1ZG|5.0|Those Angry Days is another popular historical bestseller by Lynn Olson. Her former big sellers \\"Citizens of London\\" and \\"Troublesome Young Men\\" (about the coterie of Winston Churchill supporters prior to British rejection of appeasement and the adoption of Churchill's bellicose calls for war against the Nazis and Fascists) were both interesting reads. Now in this, her best book to date, Olson puts the United States of America under the microscope. The period surveyed is the 1930s leading up to American entry into the world war on the day Pearl Harbor was attacked by Japan on December 7, 1941.<br />  What was America like in those stormy days prior to our entry into the war on the side of the Allies especially beleagured Great Britain?<br />a. The country was bitterly divided between American First isolationists and interventionist. Charles Lindbergh the famous aviator was the glamour boy of the isolationists. Lindbergh believed America should stay out of the raging European War. He was anti-Jewish and believed Nazi Germany was a nation in the ascendant. He had visited Germany and was friendly with many of the Nazi bigwigs. His lovely and sensitive wife Anne (a daughter of Dwight and Elizabeth Morrow) had grown up wealth and comfort as a child of privilege. Her father had served as US Ambassador to Mexico while mother Elizabeth and her sibling Con advocated support of Britain and the Allies. Anne was torn in her loyalties to her husband and her family. She became a famous author and is the most interesting character in these pages.<br />b. Franklin Roosevelt defeated Wendell Wilkie in his third campaign for POTUS in the bitter and dirty 1940 election. Wilkie was a Hoosier who favored intervention in Europe. He was a liberal Republic disdained by such conservatives in the party as Thomas E. Dewey and Robert Taft the son of William Howard Taft and a staunch conservative Senator from Ohio. Olson is very good at describing the 1940 election victory of FDR. Roosevelt was able through his keen political skill to get the lend-lease bill of aid to England through Congress; get the first peacetime draft in history approved and help foster British propaganda urge support of Great Britain in Anglophobic America.<br />c. Military leaders like Geroge C. Marshall Chief of Staff and Secretary of War Henry Stimson helped prepare America for war through increasing military strength in men and equipment.<br />  The book is filled with mini-biographies of such figures as Father Coughlin the anti-Jewish radio priest from Detroit; Chicago Tribune isolationist publisher Robert McCormick and many others. The book is lavishly illustrated with period photographs. The prose reads well and this book will have the ability to keep you reading into the wee hours of the morning.<br />Olson deals with a period little known or understood by modern Americans.<br />  An excellent book well recommended!able through his keen political skill to get the lend-lease bill of aid to England through Congress; get the first peacetime draft in history approved and help foster British propaganda urge support of Great Britain in Anglophobic America.<br />c.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|When my husband and I started dating, he laughed at how much I loved flowers and that I knew all of them by name and each inspired a different emotion or meaning. I had never read a dictionary of flower meanings, but I had my own &#34;language of flowers&#34; so the title intrigued me. I'm so glad I read it! I loved the character development and all the innuendo. Beautifully written and emotionally charged. Thank you for this story.
B008G12ERC|1.0|Good bands last the test of time. They have the ability to produce very varied tracks which nevertheless share the essence that originally drew you to them. When you hear their latest song, you instantly know it's them. Muse have always been such a band. I've found that I either love or hate their songs, the wonderful melodies and soaring crescendos. New Born, Take a Bow, Super Massive Black Hole are loud, gutsy and orchestral. I never tire of them. They give me goose bumps. They are a slap in the face that wakes you up.<br /><br />Which is why I'm disappointed with The 2nd Law. Bland, bland, bland. I was reminded of Take That & Genesis. The title track is like a disco dance anthem. I am so sure that it wont grow on me that I can't be bothered to give it another listen. The lyrics may be good but honestly if the melody is crushingly dull, why would I listen again? I know after the first few bars if I am going to like a track because it hooks me.<br /><br />If I hadn't bought the album myself I would never have guessed it was them. I'm going to see Muse on the 1st of June. I just hope they play a lot of their back catalogue.......<br /><br />NB: I have nothing against Take That or Genesis, they have produced some excellent music, but they are not Muse.
B000I3P3EM|5.0|After the beyond awful Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, the franchise redeemed itself by getting back to what made the show so great, by telling a good story to which audiences can relate, with Kirk, Spock, and McCoy right in the middle of it.  Great action sequences!  Wish they would have designed their own sets instead of using TNG sets (like Engineering, that was beyond obvious), but I enjoyed the movie so much that I didn't let that bother me...  If you're a fan of Trek, this is a must see!
B007THA4FI|3.0|If I hadn't enjoyed the Harry Potter series, I might have been less critical of this book.  I didn't find any reason to care about the characters, nor did I find the story engaging.
B000W93CHC|4.0|Very well written.  Involves you with the characters.  Lots of interesting things to,learn about living in mid evil times.  I liked Pillars of Earth a bit more.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Apparently JK Rowling said she didn't want to talk to anyone that didn't cry at the end of this book- I'm in! I loved and loathed these characters. I think Rowling was gutsy and I loved the way she was driven to write this and not care what is said about it- if that true. I wonder how many of JK Rowling's  readers would see the book differently if she had used a pen name. I'm glad to live at a time when she is producing, I look forward with anticipation to her next undertaking.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Read the three books in this trilogy, shame Stieg Larsson passed away as these books are fantastic and I certainly would havew read more of his books if there were more. Definately a must read if you enjoy a good thriller.
B005FFW46S|4.0|My daughter loves the world of Terry Pratchett. She recommended this book as my first visit to Discworld. I enjoyed the characters, their personalities, and their interactions with each other. The plot was well developed and I had no problem understanding the levels of social standings and other forms of beings. I look forward to reading more of this strange new world.

0441172717|5.0|This review is specifically about the way this paperback looks, feels, and reads.  We all know Dune is a great book so I won't go over that.  When I ordered this particular edition (black cover with the vertical rectangle of the 'dunes'), I fretted about the quality of the book.  Well, I am here to say that it exceeded my expectations.  Here's what I love about it:<br /><br />1.  It's chunky, but not too unwieldy.<br />2.  The font is decent, not too small.<br />3.  The words do not go into the middle of the inner spine; there is a nice margin all the way around the text.<br />4.  It opens without strain.<br />5.  I don't envision the spine cracking because of the nice give when the pages are opened for reading.<br />6.  It doesn't make that crinkly sound like a lot of paperbacks these days.  The paper lays flat with no wrinkles.<br /><br />Well, there you go.  Don't worry about buying this cheaper version of this great book.  Put that savings into buying the next ones in this classic sci-fi series.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|love this game!! makes me wanna play the real thing at Dave and busters... has force closed few times.. vnessagrl
B004MC0FO8|1.0|When I first installed it on my Kindle Fire It worked fine.  It gave me all the information about the recording I was listening to.  Since then it just gives me the information of the first recording it listened to.  I have tested it side by side with Shazam on my wife's Ipad, which works just fine, and it fails every time.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|If kids are reading this book---or anything for that matter---then, great. But if you're over 16 you may find this gaggingly cute as I did. But the good news is: you can return kindle books in less than 7 days. Just go to your manage my kindle page and click  return.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|There are many sounds related to water which is fine, but I dont need &quot;storm&quot; and others if I have &quot;cavern&quot; and &quot;slow waves&quot;<br /><br />And who finds the sound of a vacuum cleaner pleasant? Come on!<br /><br />If they are going to put a vacuum cleaner sound on this program, then where is the sound for the dishwasher, refrigerator ,dryer and clothes washer, which are far more pleasant sounding<br />I am assuming those are on the paid version?<br /><br />But anyhow, I am glad I found this program. It's helped me with my stress level tremendously.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I am not finished with the book but already love it!  I've already heard a lot from my friends and Malcolm Gladwell didn't disappoint!  I've read Malcolm Gladwell's work before and this is another good book well done!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I guess that the draw to this series is not just the drama that is in it, but the history that it takes place in.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I doubt there is much about this movie I can say that hasn't been said in the over 400 reviews here on Amazon, so I will keep it short. Bradley Cooper surpassed my expectations in his performance. This says a lot considering the stellar cast of this film. If you think this is a comedy you will be disappointed. It is more like the Space Mountain of emotional roller coasters. I say Space Mountain because it is a dark coaster so you don't know what is coming. I find most movies are predictable these days, so I enjoyed Silver Lining's originality.<br />SPOILER ALERT: With that said, I'm compelled to make one comment that is not part of the review of SLP as a film. To even consider betting your future on a sports game is NUTS. To make that bet against the New York Giants is a level of stupidity that should require oneself and one's offspring to be neutered as to remove them from the gene pool. I must say, it feels good to get that out. Phew. Thank you, Amazon for the forum. Notice I did not say how the bet turned out, just that such a bet is stupid to make. Oh, and it was a shame when Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper got hit by a bus at the end. Bummer.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I initially hated Thrift Shop, thought it was stupid.  It's grown on me now, but Macklemore is so much more than Thrift Shop.  Seeing the NPR Tiny Desk presentation on YouTube changed my mind.  He opened with the song Same Love, and I realized he actually has a brain, and real thoughts. Not just some joke.  The whole CD is full of songs with a story, a message, and personal experiences.  Normally this is not music I would typically listen to. I do not like rap, hip hop, spoken word, etc., but for some reason I love this CD, haven't stopped listening since I got it over two weeks ago.
B000000H57|5.0|Probably the 2nd best Type O Negative works after Bloody Kisses,an excellent group of songs from them. A must have for Type O fans or people just getting into their music. Get a USED cd ive saved a lot of money and the quality is great no problems.
0060873027|4.0|Very good, interesting, made me wish I could shrink and explore the micro world. Recommended reading. Crichton and Preston did good!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This item met all my expectations. I enjoy getting things from Amazon.com. It's opened a new world to me. My wife may not like it but hey, she loves me anyway.
B008PQ8XZK|3.0|I found the book too drawn out and convoluted in the early stages.  In my opinion there was a lot of irrelevant padding which wasn't necessary for the plot.  Towards the middle I was considering abandoning the book but it did improve in the second half.
B008XO7X4G|4.0|Nothing can scare you more than a man with no legs running after you on his arms.  At times hard to watch.
