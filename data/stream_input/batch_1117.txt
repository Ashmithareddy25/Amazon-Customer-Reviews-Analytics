B003ELKNOK|3.0|The new release of 10 Bon Jovi albums is nice for the consumer who already doesn't own the 1999 Bon Jovi Remasters CD's. Some extra live tracks, new booklets and access to some bonus material on bonjovi.com aren't enough reason for me to \\"Rebuy\\" these Cd's. The 1999 Remasters sound alot better and have song lyrics included! A money- making ploy no doubt, gotta love it!
0321213351|4.0|This book was a timely read for me, because at work I recently ended up having to reinvent someone's medium-sized project because it contained some of the worst structured code I've ever seen. Apart from poorly named variables, comments-free, kitchen-sink methods and classes, what made it go from difficult to impossible (and others before me had tried and failed to leverage this code) was the fact that it seemed to think itself extensible because it included classes named \\"strategy\\" and \\"mediator\\" - in other words it attempted to use inappropriate patterns. It had the \\"strategies\\" doing data access, for example. At programming school they taught us that patterns are supposed to help new devs act like experienced devs, but code like this shows that patterns can make it worse.    This book starts out by acknowledging that. Indeed, I was struck by the resemblance between the system I've been working on and the patterns crazy \\"hello world\\" implementation shown as a cautionary example in one of the early chapters of \\"Refactoring to Patterns\\". The post that the book quotes from captures the problem I faced, right down to system's XML configs that give the illusion of flexibility till you realize that the ability to change behaviour without recompiling doesn't necessarily make it easier to change stuff when setting the config keys correctly requires intimate knowledge of the system.    You almost need a whole other book on \\"refactoring away from patterns\\", which this book does touch on, but the author seems to be saying we don't generally have to get it right the first time we code. He gives at least one real world example involving the command pattern where he thinks it would have been impractical not to make design decisions up front, but he's pushing the idea that this is the exception rather than the rule. This idea - made popular by different flavours of agile - was seductive to me when I first heard it because I was frustrated with SDLC's endless design sessions andparalysis by analysis. The truth is somewhere in the middle, I think, between extreme programming and SDLC - regardless of process we're going to try our best to get it right the first time and find out as much as we can about what we need before we invest a lot of time coding. When you refactor you have to refactor the unit tests, and no refactoring technique or unit test can remove the need to think when I first code, anymore than I'm gonna deliberately typo in this review because I have spellcheck. A couple of years ago I had a good experience completely rewriting a scheduling algorithm that I needed to extend, when the requirement emerged to calculate past dates as well as future dates. I was able to gain confidence that my new implementation still worked because I had unit tests. On the other hand if it had been possible to get that information upfront it would've saved man hours - the unit tests mitigated the impact of revisiting that code.    But can a project go so far down the wrong path it's time to throw it away, keeping in mind that if it's that screwed it probably doesn't have unit tests around it? It'd be interesting to see how Joshua Kerievsky would've approached the code I faced, but I did reread an old blog post in which the cofounder of Fog Creek software argues that the decision to rewrite rather than refactor was the cause of Netscape's decline - prophetic because written in 2000 before Netscape disappeared completely - so I went the route of doing a heavy refactoring rather than a rewrite. I certainly did not sit with this book beside me following its advice step by step (indeed the afterword says you shouldn't) but the spirit of the book did help me, its teaching that these pretty UML diagrams we learn can be useful down in the trenches with existing code. The project is not quite out of the woods just yet (don't wanna jinx it :) ) but I can say that before the xmas holidays I walked someone who had been at the company longer than me through the rewritten code and it became evident that what I'd done major heart surgery on but kept functionally intact did quite cleverly address many of the problems I would've had to relearn for myself had I thrown the code away and taken the naive approach.    From a blog post by Joel Spolsky:    \\"Back to that two page function. Yes, I know, it's just a simple function to display a window, but it has grown little hairs and stuff on it and nobody knows why. Well, I'll tell you why: those are bug fixes. One of them fixes that bug that Nancy had when she tried to install the thing on a computer that didn't have Internet Explorer. Another one fixes that bug that occurs in low memory conditions. Another one fixes that bug that occurred when the file is on a floppy disk and the user yanks out the disk in the middle. That LoadLibrary call is ugly but it makes the code work on old versions of Windows 95.    \\"Each of these bugs took weeks of real-world usage before they were found. The programmer might have spent a couple of days reproducing the bug in the lab and fixing it. If it's like a lot of bugs, the fix might be one line of code, or it might even be a couple of characters, but a lot of work and time went into those two characters.\\"    So I guess while I've yet to use any particular step-by-step refactoring from those detailed in this book, I benefited from the idea behind it, which is to respect existing code and think about patterns only where they can help your actual system do its thing, rather than throw every design pattern into a system because you think it will make you look cool in a whiteboard design session.    Indeed, some of my inspiration for my blog was the mismatch between what sounds good and what it actually takes to get something working, and the fact that some people make their entire living based on what sounds good. A team leader I worked with (note the past tense) once said that he sees a senior dev role as less technical than a midlevel, and in fact his own aspiration was to stop coding altogether and focus on project management and high-level design. This kind of elitism, and belief that implementation details are somehow piddling while more advanced devs are those who step back, code less, and \\"play with ideas\\" has always bothered me but I'd be lying if I said I didn't understand it. Back at uni in the later years of my Software Eng degree we did entire subjects that were just about producing SDLC documentation for hypothetical systems and I remember they made us read an article that said something to the effect that the implementation phase should require the least amount of thought if you have done all the previous SDLC phases correctly. The corollary of this is that more advanced developers should focus on design and requirements gathering while the grunt work of implementation should be left to \\"lesser developers\\".    \\"By the middle of the 1990s, the waterfall process dominated the world of software. The field of Software Engineering was defined by it; and by the catalog of analysis and design documents that Architects, Designers, and Analysts were expected to produce. Coding was a detail. The least important part of the process. If you wrote your documents well, and drew all the necessary diagrams, then you were doing it right. You were an engineer. The code could be left to the to the unwashed minions in the cellar.\\"    - \\"What Killed Waterfall could Kill Agile\\", Robert C. Martin.     And as the article quoted above notes, while some of the documentation may have disappeared the stratification of IT has not.    But it was good to see Joshua Kerievsky getting his hands dirty with implementation details and showing how patterns can make a difference to real code and legacy code. Viva refactoring.
0740748475|4.0|In my elementary school, the students in my class would get book flyers from Scholastic - which sells the books to promote the whole \\"reading is fun!\\" attitude. The first time I had ever read Calvin & Hobbes was around 1986 (I was 6 years old). The philosophical and esoteric jokes went WAY over my head, but I thought the slime and booger jokes were just about the funniest things I had ever read. Plus, I adored tigers. From then on, every time we got a new flyer in class, I would look for ANYTHING Calvin and Hobbes. I went to the library looking for more Calvin books.<br />Bill Watterson writes with such a balanced mix of playfulness, cynicism and hope that it was difficult not to become emotionally attached to his work.<br />Because I grew up in the 80s and early 90s, I was a pawn of commercialism. Do you like Strawberry Shortcake? Well, here she is in doll form! How about the Care Bears? Well, here they are too!<br />I so wanted my own Calvin and Hobbes dolls, t-shirts, sheets or anything that would satisfy my trained need for commercialism.<br />After receiving the Compete Box Set and reading Bill Watterson's intro and reasoning as to why he never licensed his work... I get it now. Then again, I am now 30 years old and no longer have any want for toys (except a Hobbes tiger. I still dearly want a Hobbes tiger. I just can't help that, and I'm ok with it).<br />Long story short, Calvin and Hobbes has been and will be one of the many things that makes me happy.<br />Mr. Watterson, you have touched many people's hearts with your simple and honest portrayal of the absurd, sometimes terrible and mostly heartwarming situations of life! Ugh, that sounds like a commercial. What can I say? I am a child of my times! A 30 year old child.<br />I took off one star because the description said \\"like new\\" and the outside of the box as well as the cover of the books showed some pretty obvious signs of wear. The inside of the books are pristine. I'm not really sure how that works out. But, either way, I'm just happy to have his complete set.just happy to have his complete set.
B003BWERF8|5.0|One of my two essential Bluetooth accessories for the iPod nano 6G.<br /><br />Since the iPod nano 6G doesn't have Bluetooth, a dongle is your only option. While dozens of choices exist, the i10s BT adapter is the smallest of the lot. When you're rocking the world's smallest iPod, you don't want a big horsey adapter jutting out of the side. At about two-thirds the size of Sony's BT adapter, the i10s is the perfect fit. The i10s is zero-config and auto-pairs when it's powered up. It also has pretty good range, although I mostly used mine about a foot away from the receiving headphones. The i10s looks like it'll be the perfect fit for my LunaTik watch kit when I get home.<br /><br />For the other, check out:<br />[...]

B002ZG98UA|3.0|While the fourth live action Resident Evil movie was done in 3D, but it only sucks that I do not own a 3D TV to make watching it at home in any way like that.  As for the movie itself I think it's on par like that of Apocalypse, and little better than that of Extinction.  Anyone that has played Resident Evil 5, will recognize some things that were taken from that game including one of the main baddies of the whole Resident Evil franchise that finally gets more screen time in this movie.  The story itself picks up where Extinction left off at and exploring some of the things that they weren't able to do in that movie, though the writing was good, though it felt like it could've been a tad better to me anyways.  The action was great to me and couldn't have been any better and the acting was solid from some to most of the actors I think.  Overall I give this film 3 stars out of 5.
B003WTE886|5.0|I bought this CD for my wife a couple weeks ago and she absolutely loves it. Naturally, I have been forced to listen to a few of the songs myself. We all know about the ones that are currently playing on the radio, but I was pleasantly surprised to hear some quality songs on the back-end of the album that have not hit mainstream radio (specifically \\"haunted\\" and \\"never grow up\\" for parents). It is hard to find a quality CD where there is more than 1 or 2 songs worth playing, but I will make an exception and recommend the whole album.
B000099T3P|3.0|I remember watching this movie years ago when I was only like around 12 or 13 years old.  At the time it was a little creepy movie with those man eating hairballs from outer space but at the same time I found them to be comical at some points throughout the movie.  Though I think that this movie is not so much horror though mostly Sci Fi with some comedy well put into the movie and the Critters (aka Crites), would probably freak out some people but not everyone.  While the story may seem a little cheesy now but I guess it's just one of those movies that may have inbetween aged well and not aged well.  Overall I give Critters 3.5 stars out of 5.
0312600844|5.0|This novel is a serious, absurd,playful, vicious,sensitive,caring,obtuse, enlightening,psychologically insightful, multi-generational exploration of family and personality development in The America we live in today. Bravo!
B00005RHGK|3.0|Rented this movie, since I couldn't watch it whenever it was on cause it was already going or I never seem to get to watch all of it.  Movie was a little creepy as I remember when watching bits and pieces of it years ago.  With the 'Creeper' chasing the two teenagers and creeping them out and making me feel like I know how they would feel in that kind of situation.  I mean sure that this wasn't expected to be good, but to me this is one of those horror movies that makes me almost 'piss my pants' if you're not used to movies like this.  Only thing is that don't expect a lot of gore or anything when watching this movie if you haven't seen this movie already.  One thing that I'm trying to figure out is how does the 'creeper' know where they are and all that, though that may not be important part of the plot in any way.  The writing though is good for a movie like this and had me wondering what was going to happen next.  Overall I give Jeepers Creepers 3 stars out of 5.
B0019X3ZZY|5.0|I won't talk about how daring and powerful this film is, cos there are hundreds of other reviews for that. But I will say the new, remastered hi-def Criterion DVD set looks great and that's all that matters. Included are documentaries and interviews, as well as trailers and other features. The movie, which was taken from an old Marquis De Sade novel and twisted into a kind of fascist, political allegory, has never looked better. And fringe movie fans will enjoy. Almost plays like a cross between the earlier works of Tinto Brass and John Waters. Great DVD/collector item.
B004AKCME8|4.0|The Guardians of Ga'Hoole.  I never heard of the books until sometime after the movie came out on DVD and went about renting it to see how the movie was since it was one of those movies that had a limited release to theatres, which limits my chances of seeing some movies like this.  I hope that people realize that this movie is not based on the whole series of the books that was written by Kathryn Lasky rather than that of the first 3 books in the series.  The visuals of the movie are the best I've seen for any CG made film and probably looks just as good as with Pixar is with their CG animated films.  I'd have to say that when it comes to the writing it seems that they were able to adapt things from the novels but they went about making it a little different than that of how the books are and changed it up a bit for some to help understand.  This is one of the few animated movies that was done totally by Computer Animation that I watched and can go about watching it over and over if I could.  Overall I give Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole 4 stars out of 5.

B002ZG98G4|1.0|I have always liked Rachel McAdams but not in this movie.  The movie started out slow and boring; I really hoped it would get better but unfortunately, it did not.  The movie wasn't funny and there was no chemistry between the stars.  I wanted to like this movie but I did not and my biggest mistake was watching it to the very end. I will NOT be buying this movie.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is our new favorite game.  It's hard enough to keep you interested, but easy enough that an 8 year old has won a few times.  It's has a lot of replay value.
B002ZG9774|1.0|I decided to give this movie a try and was ready to turn it off within 15 minutes.  Christina can really sing but she can't act.  I was disappointed in Cher.  I have always enjoyed her movies but I have to say the acting in this movie was terrible.  No chemistry. The musical numbers were ok but after a while, they too began to get on my nerves.  Very disappointed in this movie, I can see why it didn't do well at the box office.
B004OZZ624|4.0|The actors are on top of their game so the movie moves along smooth with a good mix of suspense and action.  I liked the central crisis of how the government can crush a single human being at will even when the person is innocent.  So what can a single individual who has always been law abiding do about it? Watch the movie and see a possible outcome.  It is worth the watch.
B004A8ZX28|4.0|If you are fortunate enough to find yourself in a hit film, Hollywood will most likely ask you to repeat the success and either make a sequel or make a film so similar it could be a sequel. The enticement? Usually a large, mega-size paycheck.<br /><br />A few years ago, Liam Neeson stumbled into a new genre of film with \\"Taken\\", a silly action film conceived and produced by Luc Besson, the French Joel Silver. It was a big hit and proved the addition of the venerable actor's gravitas to a dumb action film could help the movie stand out from the pack. Hollywood was eager to replicate the success, so Joel Silver brought \\"Unknown\\" to the popular star.<br /><br />\\"Taken\\" and \\"Unknown\\" have their respective producer's stamp all over them; Besson films are marked by outlandish, unbelievable story turns and Silver's films usually contain elaborately choreographed improbable action sequences. Yet, because both films star Neeson, and both are set in European cities, I think people assume both films are more similar than they actually are.<br /><br />I was surprised by how much I enjoyed \\"Taken\\". In it, Neeson's character uses his dormant skill set, abandoned when he changed jobs to save his marriage, to travel to Paris and track down his kidnapped daughter. Unlike Besson's next film \\"From Paris With Love\\", \\"Taken\\" works because, and only because of, Neeson's performance. He is so serious throughout you begin to believe he could actually track down his daughter and fight his way though the multitude of bad guys surrounding her.<br /><br />In \\"Unknown\\", Neeson's character, Dr. Martin Harris, and his quest, have a lot more turns and facets, making the journey more cerebral, more suspenseful and more interesting.<br /><br />That said, my partner guessed the storyline after watching the preview a few months before we actually got to see the film. But I found myself becoming engrossed in the story just the same,<br /><br />Dr, Martin Harris (Neeson) and his wife, Liz (January Jones, TV's \\"Mad Men\\") arrive in Berlin for a summit. Henry has been invited to speak at a summit sponsored by a leading scientist (Sebastian Koch) ready to reveal a major breakthrough. A controversial Arab leader also sponsors the summit. Because of all of this, security is tight. Upon their arrival, Martin realizes he left his briefcase at the airport and hails a taxi to go back and get it. Liz stays to check in. On the way to the airport, the taxi gets in an accident and plunges into the river. Gina (Diane Kruger), the driver, saves Martin but quickly runs off. Four days later, Martin wakes up in the hospital. He rushes back to the hotel and finds Liz, but she doesn't recognize him. In fact, she introduces Martin, and hotel security, to her husband, Martin (Aidan Quinn). Martin becomes frantic and confused. Then people start trying to kill him.<br /><br />Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (\\"Orphan\\", \\"House of Wax (2005)\\"), \\"Unknown\\" would be referred to by many as 'Hitchcockian'. Many thrillers are still labeled with this term, trying to draw a connection to the renowned filmmaker. \\"Unknown\\" is one of the few films deserving the connection; it is evocative of late Hitchcock, lesser Hitchcock, \\"Torn Curtain\\" Hitchcock, but Collet-Serra gets enough right to earn this comparison.<br /><br />Once again, Neeson's gravitas makes the film watchable and more interesting than it may have a right to be.<br /><br />From the moment the film begins and we meet the couple in the airplane upon their arrival in Berlin, Martin is a serious man; he Is seriously in love with his wife, seriously interested in delivering a good speech at the conference, seriously interested in his colleague's research, seriously confused and becomes seriously pissed off at the people trying to kill him. As soon as he wakes up in the hospital, he tries to piece together what happened. He's been in a coma for four days? His wife has been alone in a city she doesn't know for four days? Then he realizes his wifehas been alone for four days while he was in a coma. He rushes to the hotel and spots her.<br /><br />Neeson plays the role straight. In every moment, he has a goal. The goal changes throughout the film, but we always know what he is trying to figure out. The key to his performance is when Martin spots Liz in the hotel. She stares at him blankly, seems a bit confused, and introduces him to her husband. Martin is thoroughly defeated. Maybe he did get things mixed up. Maybe he does have a concussion and the accident was more harmful than he felt. So he returns to the hospital. As he waits for the doctor to run additional tests, someone tries to kill him. He gets pissed off and realizes someone; somewhere is trying to hide something.<br /><br />January Jones is cool and icy and evocative of Tippi Hedren. Liz is enough of an enigma to remain mysterious. Jones walks a tightrope throughout. She has to convince us everything she knows is true, basically contradicting everything we learn. She doesn't seem to fit into the puzzle, but because she is so sure Martin is not her husband, she causes him to feel doubt.<br /><br />The last piece of the puzzle is Diane Kruger's Gina. As she drives the cab Martin is in when he has the accident, is she a piece of the puzzle as well? How does she fit into the puzzle? Gina, an illegal living in Berlin, trying to desperately raise money to get her papers and get out of the city. She takes shifts driving her friend's cab and works other jobs. She seems real and authentic throughout. And in this type of film, this usually means she is involved in some way.<br /><br />Bruno Ganz has a memorable role as Ernst Jurgen, a former Stazi agent who now fills his time as a private eye. He calls on his considerable connections to help him figure things out and tries to help his new client, Martin. There are other facets to his character that make him even more interesting and unusual.<br /><br />Martin is given Jurgen's contact information and arranges to meet with him. Jurgen seems perplexed by the changes going on in the society around him but faces the daily challenges with a certain amount of detachment. After listening to Martin's story, he agrees to poke around a bit. This character is a nice touch because he adds validity to Martin's quest.<br /><br />Frank Langella pops up as one of Martin's colleagues, a man who may be able to help piece the puzzle together.<br /><br />\\"Unknown\\" has a lot of twists and turns. Generally, these can be problematic. The filmmakers are usually not skilled enough to tie everything together, to make everything fit in a believable way an d most viewers are savvy enough to spot these problems right away. But Collet-Serra makes them work. Less skilled directors learn about Hitchcock's use of the 'MacGuffin' and think it gives them license to do whatever they want.

B0040JHWKS|5.0|This CD is great, as expected. If you are any kind of Springsteen fan, you need to own this. The price ($15) for 2 CDs is great. It comes with all lyrics plus a writeup (like a forward) from Bruce, pictures of him as a young hotty, and of course 2 awesome CDs. It's so cool to hear the rough beginnings of some of the songs you know and love. It's very Darkness era and super cool to hear.

B002ZG993Q|1.0|I mistakenly picked this movie up to watch with my husband, thinking this was a cool spy-type movie. This movie was so bad that I was ready to leave the room halfway through. I can get over the gratuitous butt shot in the first scene, but the rest of the movie was filled with a fully naked prostitute! It was so embarrassing to watch in front of my husband. I mean they show EVERYTHING, including her orgasming. I'm serious, there isn't a scene she's in where she's not naked. If I wanted to watch porn, I would have rented porn. Beyond that, the movie had no redeeming qualities. It was boring, there was no plot, and there were a lot of unanswered questions in the end. I would HIGHLY recommend NOT seeing this movie. I wish I hadn't.
B000G73UEU|4.0|Listening to this collection this morning, I was again struck by the beauty of his song, \\"Anthem.\\"  I am convinced that Cohen adapted the beginning words of that song (\\"The birds they sing, at the break of day.  Start again, I heard them say.\\") from a letter Vincent Van Gogh wrote to his brother, Theo. Here' Van Gogh's writing:    \\"At half-past-three in the morning, the birds began to sing at sight of dawn and I started again.\\"    Everytime I hear that song I think of Van Gogh.    Listening to Cohen's songs interpreted by other artists (McGarrigle Sisters, Rufus Wainwright, Martha Wainwright, Perle Batalla among others) I find that his words ring true.  It takes a special singer/musician to sincerely convey the deep emotional and intellectual depth of his works.    This is an effective collection of most of Cohen's best-known songs, and includes Cohen himself performing with U2 on \\"Tower of Song.\\"  I haven't seen the film yet and will someday, I'm sure, but the disc itself is extremely effective in its own right.

The author recounts a set of stories that explain many things I thought I understood.  Now I have gained a new perspective on them.      Pros  The book entertains, inspires, and indirectly through examples offers advice on how to live successfully.    Cons  The author oversimplifies some things, evidently to make his case more easily accepted.    Conclusion  An enjoyable read.  I have just checked out his newest book called What the Dog Saw.

B004QXJZXA|5.0|This is the story of race driver Steve McQueen coming back to LeMans after a crash (shunt) the previous year where another driver was killed. Film shows the preparation it takes to put on a race and the physical and emotional toll on drivers (and wives/girlfriends) when the race is won or lost. Extremely good race footage and some spectacular crashes caught on film. McQueen meets the wife of the driver that was killed and you can see from the interaction the pain that racing has caused. I like this film and rate it one of the very best racing movies of all time...behind GRAND PRIX...and ahead of..THE RACERS with Kirk Douglas....don't miss this film if you like racing.
B004I2K4DY|4.0|Has it really been 15 years already??  I thought it was only a couple years ago when my friends and I caught the 10th anniversary on PBS!  Well, I am a HUGE fan of this musical.  I have watched it twice live and love listening to it on CD.  I was ecstatic to catch the 25th anniversary on PBS (twice!).    First the negatives (2 stars off):  1. Nick Jonas - his voice is not terrible, really.  It just does not have the depth, and it may be a maturity level, but regardless he should not have been casted as Marius at this time.  Who knows, maybe in a decade his voice will mature?  Additionally, his one facial expression got annoying after the first song.  I really could not look at him anymore.  2. The producers for casting Nick Jonas - I am actually more ticked off at the actual decision to cast him!  He is obviously not ready for this part, but it seemed like they wanted to use him as advertisement.  \\"Les Miserables\\" can stand on its own without any pop celebrity's help.    Now, I do have to give a star back for Norm Lewis.  His voice is perfect for Javert!  I think he is the best Javert I have heard!    Overall this concert was fantastic.  I am awfully biased toward John Owen-Jones, having seen him live, but Alfie Boe as Valjean is amazing!  His \\"Bring Him Home\\" and \\"Finale\\" had me crying just as hard.  I'm always happy to see Lea Salonga sing anything, and Ramin Karimloo as Enjoras- wow!  And the encore with the Valjean quartet was like icing the cake - could not have thought of a more perfect ending!

B003102JDM|5.0|The Coens do maintain perfect control over the look and timing and tone of this deeply weird comedy. I didn't even know this was a Coen Bros film until after the credits started rolling. Then it all began to make sense. Before that, I was sometimes confused by the point here: The prologue set in 19th century Poland implies that we are somehow going to be watching a modern-day horror film in which we must watch to see who will be exposed as a type of devil or vampire. When the circa 1967 part of the film begins, it seems to be some type of deeply weird Jewish comedy. Only after awhile, does the viewer settle down and soak up the comic details. The look of suburban Minneapolis at the dawn of the hippy era as flower power just begins to creep into the Midwest is exactly perfect, it seems to me. The soundtrack, mainly songs from the Jefferson Airplane's 1967 classic \\"Surrealistic Pillow,\\" is also powerful. If you like Coen brothers movies, you will want to catch this.
0670022411|5.0|A Discovery of Witches is one of the best books I have ever read. The author grabs you at the top of page 2 and takes you on a fast-paced ride all the way to the end. The most interesting character in the book is the male lead- a vampire. You learn so much interesting information about happenings during his long time on earth. The author cleverly gives us this information through dialogue, not boring paragraphs of description.     Since this book is the first of a trilogy, I only wish I had discovered it after all 3 had been written. I wanted to go directly to book 2, but now I have to wait for it to be written.  SO GOOD! You will not want to put it down.

B000SEJHRA|4.0|The only missing star from my review is that not every essay is up to the full Sedaris potential...  But some of them certainly are, and are great.  Reflective, funny and even touching at times, Sedaris makes you want to be friends with a moving company ex-felon who \\"would like to say he'd never kill anybody again, but that's a very serious promise to make.\\"

B0041KKYDI|1.0|Boring and confusing.  The book is phenomenal, but the movie fell short.  Even having read the book I was confused by the movie.  At times it was hard to know what the flashbacks were referring to. I recommend reading the book or getting the book on tape to get a great account if the story. I normally dislike book on tape but this one kept my attention.
B004B32532|5.0|I watched this film in 1991 on a dark and grainy mexican VHS copy. This Blu Ray version blew me away to say the least. The transfer is spectacular, colors are rich, blacks are deep and the film itself was cleaned of dust and scratches. The special features are great, specially the 2 hour documentary \\"Forget Everything You Have Ever Seen: The World of Santa Sangre\\", which gives extensive and valuable information about the shooting of the movie, interviews with the actors and director, etc.<br /><br />This film is not for everybody, however. It's surreal, bizarre, but at the same time very touching. It will make you cringe, but also it will make you cry. The soundtrack is something I'd like to give special mention as the song selection is perfect for each and every scene. To me, this is Alejandro Jodorowsky's definitive masterpiece; in his own words, his favorite film.<br /><br />There's too much violence in the world, too much evil, but there's also innocent love that can turn things around. You have to watch to believe it.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|Nowadays, it seems that just about any film that has blood, gore, a bit of the supernatural, and cheap, predictable thrills is labeled as a horror film. I've been disenchanted by the Horror film genre for many, many years because the label is so often slapped on drivel that I find more stupid than scary, and with no real horror to it - just stupid people running around doing stupid things, and having predictable resulting events because of those actions.<br /><br />\\"Let Me In\\" is what a true, quality horror film SHOULD be. It has reminded me that a horror film doesn't have to have cheap thrills and predictable loud sounds or shocking scenes preceded by predictably suspenseful music to count as a horror film. This film just rises far, far above what typical \\"Horror\\" films have become over the years, which, in a word, has been disappointing. This is an excellent film, and one that I'm glad to have in my collection. It's superbly acted all around, with the villains quickly earning your loathing, and the lead characters giving nuanced performances that never go over the top, but subtly and quickly pull you in.<br /><br />I'm going to try not to give any spoilers here, because I'm sure that it's easy enough to find those already most everywhere you look for reviews of this film, but suffice it to say that this will undoubtedly fulfill all that you've been hoping to find in a good horror film. \\"Let Me In\\" goes far beyond just a standard horror. In fact, I feel that, if the supernatural elements were taken away from it, this would simply have been seen as an excellent dark drama. But the supernatural elements just help to give it an extra boost that takes it above so much of the junk that's being released in American cinema lately.<br /><br />Chloe Grace Moretz is wonderful and delicate in her portrayal of angel-faced Abby, and Kodi-Smit McPhee is heartbreakingly sweet and gentle in his portrayal of a willowy, neglected lonely boy taken to the breaking point by the bullying that has become woefully prevalent in today's schools. The young actors playing the bullies quickly had me rooting for the @$$-whupping that the head thug so richly deserved (regardless of it being outlined later that he was only doling out what he himself had obviously endured for so long).<br /><br />I've already given away more than I wanted to, so I won't go into any more true detail about what exactly happens here, but I must say that I was very interested in seeing this when it hit the theatres, but never made it in time. \\"Let Me In\\" has, however, totally been worth the wait. It's set in the 80s, and filmed in a darker color scheme, which only contributes to the feel of being transported to a totally different time and place than what you may be used to. The clues to exactly what is happening, and how the events portrayed in the film have come about, are subtly laid out for you, which I appreciate. Having everything explained to me (as if I'm incapable of figuring it out on my own) in a film is often a let-down to me, so I appreciate that the director and screenwriter have enough trust in their audiences' intelligence to let us figure it out for ourselves.<br /><br />Long story short, \\"Let Me In\\" is easily one of the best horrors that I've seen in DECADES. It's subtle, eerie, and dark, with great acting, just the right amount of blood and gore (with none of it misplaced), minimal and convincing CGI, and a story engaging enough that I look forward to watching it again soon.lly prevalent in today's schools.

1439102724|5.0|Review<br /><br />In my opinion, Sing You Home is by far the best book Jodi Picoult has written.  Not because of how it was written, but because of the content.  I've read all her novels and each one affected me in different ways, but no book has affected me on such a personal level than Sing You Home.<br /><br /> I found myself relating to Zoe and Vanessa.  I too unexpectedly fell in love with a woman a few years ago. It was a relationship neither of us expected; it just happened.  Some people understood and could care less; others made it a personal mission to prove to us we were sick, sinners, and what we were doing is wrong. The nature of our relationship doesn't change who we are when, after all, we're just humans like the rest of you.  All we knew is that we sincerely cared about each other and now, four years later, we are a very happy couple who has overcome many obstacles to get where we are, and we know if we ever want marriage and kids, we better prepare for battle, just like Zoe and Vanessa.<br /><br />Picoult tackles the same issues and emotions in this novel, which is why it affected me on a deeper level.  It's almost as if she's asking the questions What is so wrong with two people being in love, no matter the sex? And Why wouldn't they be good parents simply because they share the same sex?  She explores issues of parenting, culture, religion, marriage, intolerance, and does each side of the spectrum complete justice.  In Zoe and Vanessa's chapters, you can feel Picoult's opinion about a same-sex couple being parents and how it won't affect the child, especially if they are good people, have jobs, are loving, caring, and supportive, and most of all, a safe place for the child to call home.<br /><br />As I mentioned, she also discusses the other side and does the opposing side justice.  A church and a pastor who believe homosexuals will burn in hell for their sins because the bible specifically says so.  An alcoholic man who seems succeptible to be talked into things--finding Jesus, donating his embryos, suing his ex wife, etc.  On this side, Picoult tackles issues like how a gay couple can't possibly parent a child without the child becoming gay himself.  How children are better off in a home with a mom and dad, not two moms or two dads.  She gives both sides a fair amount of time in the book, and exposes both sides of the story, which is commendable.  It's often difficult to explore both sides of the issue when you're clearly on one side, not the other.<br /><br />I think everyone who has ever struggled with being gay, or struggled with respecting the homosexual population should read this novel.  It's more than a novel; it's a commentary on the social status of the gay community in our community.  Gay people are people and should be awarded the same rights in this country.  Picoult, in so many words, expresses this opinion by forming her story around a complicated character triangle.  To her, it doesn't matter if you're gay or straight; all people should be allowed the same human rights.<br /><br />From the bottom of my heart, I have the utmost respect for Jodi Picoult for tackling such a sensitive issue.  I know this is a personal issue for her, as her son is openly gay, and I applaud her courage to take a stand by writing this novel, reminding us all of one thing: we're all humans; who you choose to love is your choice, no one else's, and no one should be treated unfairly because the heart wants what the heart wants.  I hope she knows how thankful the gay community is for writing something so near and dear to our own hearts.  Picoult has proven to have a very open mind by writing this story, and after I finished the novel, I started humming the chorus to a Beatles classic, \\"all you need is love, love; love is all you need\\".<br /><br />KC Kelly<br /><br />Guest Reviewernding Jesus, donating his embryos, suing his ex wife, etc.  On this side, Picoult tackles issues like how a gay couple can't possibly parent a child without the child becoming gay himself.

B0006A9FMI|2.0|Batou takes the lead role in this excellent sequel to Ghost in the Shell, but avoid this particular DVD release from Dreamworks which has no English dubbing and subtitling that includes sound effects for some reason (which I found to be very annoying).     There is another release available from Bandai including a premium edition, dubbed by the SAC voice actors and properly subtitled; however, they are five times the price of the Dreamworks release which is ridiculous for a movie and hardly justifiable considering you can purchase both GitS: SAC and GitS: 2nd Gig for that much. For those of you for whom money is no object, here are the links for the Bandai release here on Amazon. [[ASIN:B001K98MFA Ghost in the Shell, Vol. 2: Innocence]] and [[ASIN:B001K98MFK Ghost in the Shell, Vol. 2: Innocence (Steelbook with Soundtrack CD)]]    {It's unfortunate that Amazon groups all reviews for GitS 2: Innocence together as the terrible Dreamworks release is clearly a different product from the Bandai version.}
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Hello Amazon??? Why in the world would I pay $8.99 for the Kindle editions of ALL of the books in this series when I can buy the paperbacks for $7.99 at Barnes & Noble? Buyer beware--fantastic books over priced on Amazon.
B000OY8NII|3.0|I'm not a TV person. Except for an odd hour here and there or the occasional James Bond festival, I've missed pretty much everything on TV since about 1975. So, when my wife invited me to watch it on netflix, my response was \\"Yes dear. Let me get something to read.\\"<br /><br />So, I was very surprised at enjoying this, even a little. Lack of commercials did a lot for my mood. And, as a borderline nerd pride activist, so does the overall theme of people being friendly, having wide interests, and being smarter than me in every direction. Smart people are fun. (The truly smart people I mean, not the poseurs with one odd knack.)<br /><br />Well, I keep reading while I watch it, but I do that with almost everything that doesn't have subtitles. It's good, though, as commodity entertainment goes, and shows that nerds aren't just the hygiene-challenged stereotype we've come to tolerate. I'll come back for more. The \\"Andy of Mayberry\\" vibe, with the single-father sheriff and whistled theme music, adds a retro kind of appeal that clashes pleasantly with the SF backdrop.<br /><br />But it's still just TV.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
030746363X|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone whois looking for a new approach to the old questions. Ferriss delivers his research with humor and conviction. I must read!!!
B002HWRYJE|2.0|This is hard for me to write. If I watched this movie and knew nothing about Star Trek I would say it was a good movie. Having any knowledge at all and being a huge fan of the series I can no longer make that statement.     Do not read more if you plan on watching this movie and do not want to know more.      I did not mind the alternate time line but it was so made just to please the hollywood crowd. I have to give it a low rating. Maybe they will make a second and actually try to remember what Star Trek and the original characters were all about. Kirk was not a screw up, yes he was a young hot shot. Spock would never have had some sort of weird love relationship with Uhura. He spent his life and dedicated it to being Vulcan. Scotty was a brilliant dedicated chief engineer and not some bumbling fool that happens to also know something about star ships. Get my drift? Sorry if I spoiled the movie!
B0013N3MV2|4.0|I found this novel to be revealing in the sense that one was able to relate to the goodness of the majority of the characters.  At every turn, I expected the worst to happen, but things always turned out positively.  Good story.

B0013BNY2Q|5.0|Now that's what I'm talking about! This cd has the energy and excitement that's been missing from their last 3 recordings. Ranks right up there with Pageant & Monster (under-rated). And they did this without sacrificing their quirkiness, sense of humor and the usual abstract & unintelligible lyrics. And by the way, Hollow Man is a great metaphor for a group & career nearly lost... \\"I've become the hollow man I see, I see\\".
B004LGPBYY|5.0|I love this album.  It's just marvelous.  It rocks, it's deep and spiritual, it shows the band's full range - and it is just packed with great songs beginning to end.  This is a breath of fresh air for a fan - I cannot recommend it enough.  I'm simply in love with it.  Great work.  Marvelous, wonderful, magical work.  5 Stars.  I love it.  Listening to it non-stop!!
B004G5ZXVQ|4.0|This continues REM'S resurgence & picks up where Accelerate left off but taking the foot off the pedal a just bit...and that's a good thing. It's also interesting for me to note that the quality of their music over the past 25+ years has been up & down. Half their records to me are dull, plodding & uninspiring (Reckoning, Fables, half of Green, Automatic [overrated big-time], Up, Reveal & Around) while the other half of their catologue is fresh, moving, & exciting (Murmur, Pageant, Document, half of Out of Time, Monster, New Adventures, Accelerate, & now Collapse). Of course REM devotees will defend even their worst recordings as still a cut above the rest but hey what do you expect?!<br /><br />Anyways, for me I'm just a fan of good music regardless of who's playing. And while I can argue about alot of things I can't argue with what I hear and what I hear on this recording is a group that has found itself (for now at least) after wandering for about 10 years in the wilderness. Hopefully they'll keep it up!<br /><br />Favorite tracks: All the Best, &Uuml;berlin, & Every Day Is Yours to Win
B003XRDYX2|5.0|I was a very devoted fan of Bob Dylan back in the day. I read all the books I could of him, bought all the records. I tried to play like him, sound like him, write like him, even look like him.  Eventually I saw the emulation for what it was; especially when the music he subsequently began putting out did not live up to my personal standards. I still maintained a dedication to music and my own playing up to and including the present day but my tastes and influences have expanded greatly away from Mr. D.  However, what began bothering me several years ago was that I would listen to the Dylan era that had once so inspired me and found it extremely wanting. Everything that I once found so incredible to listen to: his words, his voice, his harmonica-playing; I now found grating, annoying, amateurish. Was it just me? Or maybe a total and honest reassessment of Bob Dylan and his 'artistry' was in order.  Then I got a hold of these mono recordings.  For me, the adoration I once felt for this man's musical worth has been reborn. This is what I once, many eons ago, was listening to. I had totally forgotten how they were supposed to sound! I realize that it must appear rather bizarre, perhaps even insulting, that a difference in some technological aspect of someone's musical output could make that much of a difference. But it does. It simply does.  As far as I'm concerned, the mono \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" sounds like a totally different take when compared to the stereo mix. In every other track, even the acoustic ones, the monophonic versions sound so much better than their stereophonic 'mutant' cousins.  Personally, if I were Bob Dylan, I would threaten to sue the Sony Corporation if they continued to issue any of my '60s recordings in stereo.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|This was a fun popcorn movie. I enjoyed the action and I normally hate Mary-Louise Parker. Her acting is almost as bad as Sandra Bullock. But she had decent chemistry with Willis. The plot is simply bad but the actors is what makes this film. It really is a joy to watch all these old time favorite actors work with each other. I recommend for an action movie junkie or someone that enjoys watching a collection of good actors working together. Enjoy! oh and MOLDOVA SUCKS!
0061726826|5.0|This book broke my heart.  I was so ready at the end for a happy ending and then it all went to heck!

B0041KKYBA|5.0|Beware those cloaked in legitimacy - refined manners, dress, pedigreed university degrees - instead of contributing to the economic wealth of the world, instead of attempting to lift people out of poverty, create opportunities for citizens of the world to reach their potential, or seeking anything worthwhile whatsoever, many hoard money they con from people who don't have the resources to sniff them out as human stains.

1401310400|3.0|While this book isn't exactly a literary masterpiece, it kept me entertained and turning the pages.  I guess it helps that I'm a big fan of the TV series.  I'm not sure if the book could stand on its own, as it's a bit lacking in character development and seems to rely on the reader's familiarity with the TV show characters (since the characters in \\"Heat Wave\\" are basically fictional versions of the characters in \\"Castle\\").<br /><br />All in all, though, it was an entertaining book and I'm not sorry I read it.  I'd say it's a must-read for fans of the show... but beyond that, it might not find much of an audience.  (Just a heads up: there's nudity, sex, and swearing in this book, so it's not as family-friendly as the TV series.  It would probably be okay for older teens, though.)

B004K8XWIU|5.0|Bob Marley live in concert- What's not to like?  In this long double CD, he plays all of his great songs with verve and energy.  The sound quality is good but not great - it seems to drop off in quality as the concert goes on.  But hey, it's a live concert from 30 years ago recorded without the benefit of today's modern soundboards.  In fact, part of its charm is its rough, real quality, because most of the Bob Marley we're exposed to is the crystal clear studio versions of his songs.  Some of his studio songs seem almost lifeless compared to these raw recordings.      If you are a hard-core Marley fan you may know of better recordings to buy, for casual fans, this recording is excellent.  Turn on the sound system, pick this concert recording, mix up a margarita or roll something up and you're almost there...
B000OVLINI|2.0|Angel's game was intriguing... the copy was so superbly edited... it was amazing to read.  The story, however was confusing.  This book was much worse.  The editing and writing was much more cumberous, without even the hint of a story to plague it.  Just moody Spainish drinking and walking... after 1/2 way thru hoping it would get better, I just stopped.
B002QAY31Y|5.0|I enjoyed this series when it came out in the '70's (used to show it on Thursday nights on our local PBS station).  Being a history buff, the series is one of my favorites.  I highly recommend it for someone delving into WWII from an alternative media source other than books.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Could not put this book down.  I loved it.  I feel it is the best one in the Twilight Saga.
1439102724|1.0|If Jodi Picoult wrote this book she did so with a lobotomy. This is just not her. That's all there is too it. Maye she has a writing team, but this is not her.   It's schmultzy, totally uninspired, passionless, boring, and unintelligent. Felt more like a Danielle Steele book. What happened??
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Versions of certain songs are a bit different in their mono and stereo incarnations, but none are better than the others. It's all a matter of taste. We're talking about The Beatles here. Any version of a particular song is still quite good. If you're lucky enough to be able to obtain both versions, well, consider your collection complete and be happy with that. Stop over-analizing.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I know it's overrated at this point to love this book, and it's sort of late to post a review considering there's almost 400 out there already. So I'll make this short and sweet.    The Lost Hero is a great satisfaction to fans of the Percy Jackson series. I will say that honestly. Rick Riordan has become the legend of children's novels today. I walked into the bookstore one day and saw this book came out, and I'm like \\"Sure, why not. Rick Riordan wrote it.\\" And I didn't put the book down until two hours later. This has mildly violent but entertaining fights and discussions for the juvenile bookworm. Jason's character is enriched with mystery as he attempts to uncover his lost, or rather STOLEN memories. Piper and Leo also have interesting secrets themselves. And those secrets are really what dragged me in and welcomed me to the mighty Roman world. I am out of the age group this series is aimed to, but I will happily continue to read it. Rick Riordan has become a role model for me now, for I aspire to write a successful novel myself one day.
B003YRIM0Q|3.0|After hearing about the butchered audio mixes on this release, I went back and fourth and eventually plunked down the money and ordered it, thinking \\"the audio mixes can't be THAT bad\\".<br /><br />After receiving my package and putting the first vinyl on my turntable, I couldn't believe how bad it sounded. Yikes! I went through the songs, older and newer, they don't get any better. I put on the cds and their just as bad.<br /><br />I put on my vinyl pressings of Superunknown and Badmotorfinger, for comparison, and they sound so damn good. Completely blew away Telephantasm. How could have they messed up the mastering for this release so bad? I could see some of the older/unreleased tracks possibly needing to be touched up a bit, but for the most part, the old saying applies to this \\"if it isn't broke, don't fix it\\"<br /><br />The music is overpowering Cornell's vocals in the worst way and it just sounds like a mess. Louder does not mean better. If you don't like to hear Chris Cornell hit those high notes, you'll love this remastering job. This is up there as one of the worst remastering jobs that I've had the displeasure of hearing. The original cd pressings sound much better then this.<br /><br />But on the plus side, they went all out on the packaging and the splattered/colored vinyls look real cool. The art work on everything is very nice and the boxes quality and contents are out of this world. A truly well put together deluxe edition. It's just too bad, because it's the music that matters most and it's just mastered so poorly.<br /><br />My advice, if you're really into Soundgarden and are thinking about purchasing the 'Super Deluxe Edition', get your hands on the cd or some mp3's first and see if the sound mixes are going to bother you, before throwing down your hard earned money on this edition. Don't buy this for the vinyls, thinking you're going to have that good vinyl sound, because you're not. The vinyls are basically a gimmick attached to a premium pricetag. But if the sound quality isn't what matters most, then I can't imagine you NOT being happy with this release.
0515125024|5.0|My son cant put this series down. He stays on the edge of his seat and is reading them in the order in which they were written.  Reacher is a man with integrity and honor!!
B002HWRYJE|4.0|The person I brougfht this for is very pleased with it. He says it has a great picture and sound. Very happy with it
B002ZG9774|1.0|I received two of these and amazon wanted to send out another one....they advertise that this has a digital copy and neither one of mine did! The movie is wonderful. However, I am disappointed. I wanted the digital copy and that's why I purchased this rather then in the store. I didn't find one in the stores that had a digital copy!
1423101499|4.0|Percy Jackson is looking forward to summer at Camp Half-Blood, the training camp for demigods.  But the growing conflict between Kronos, king of the Titans, and the gods of mount Olympus, has even infiltrated the camp.  It's recently been discovered that there is an entrance to Daedalus' Labyrinth on camp grounds.  If so, this entrance could be used to get around the camp's security system and attack the camp itself.  And so Percy, Annabeth, Grover, and Tyson set out on a quest into the heart of the ever changing labyrinth hoping to find Daedalus in his workshop before the Titan army does.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Percy is having dreams about Daedalus from 2000 years ago and visions of Nico's attempts to raise the dead.  Will Percy be able to reason with Nico?  Will Percy and his friends find the Daedalus' workshop and stop the army from invading their camp?<br /><br />This book is certainly another fun read.  I was always reluctant to put it down.  However, it follows the formula of the earlier books in the series.  It would really be nice if he could come up with another type of plot to hang the story on.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there is still plenty of advancement in the overall story.  Plus we get the same great creative mix of ancient myth and modern times that we've seen in the previous books.<br /><br />You can't help but love these characters, and that's the case again here.  I especially found the new romantic triangle developing fun.  Poor Percy is clueless to what is going on around him and how he is causing it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the author felt the need to preach to us about the environment a couple of times.  While I could see the argument that it is part of the story, to me it felt forced into the book.<br /><br />Still, I enjoyed this book.  After that last chapter, you can bet I will be finishing off the series very soon.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hands down one of the best books I've ever read, you will not be disappointed! Better than Harry Potter and Twlight combined! Loved the series, I didn't want it to end.
0060936223|5.0|The first time I heard of Patti Smith, I was driving in an altered state in rural Florida late at night.  They played Horses.  On the radio.  Hard to imagine that DJ lasted in business for too long.  I bought the album the next day and played it 'til it wore out.<br /><br />This is a book for those of us who passed Jim Carroll's Basketball Diaries around like it was a religious tract.  It's for those of us who read between Rimbaud's lines and wept at Bracusi's tomb.  Those of us who wished that we could be as cool as Sam Shepard, even for only one day.  It's for those of us who were outraged to the point of madness when the righties tried to use Mapplethorpe to kill arts funding.  For those of us who lost friends and colleagues and lovers to the plague.<br /><br />At the time, it was all so cutting edge.  So out there.  So cool.<br /><br />Reading this marvelous book, it appears in retrospect to be very innocent.  Sweet even.
B000BISBDY|5.0|This is my favorite Johnny Cash CD! It features some of his known classics, like Folsom Prison, Get Rhythm, and Ring of Fire, in addition to some other remakes and covers. Best part...Johnny's cover of Nine Inch Nails' Hurt. It's a powerful song, especially coming from the man in black!
B004GHYCKW|5.0|PJ Harvey has produced another rich album. This time she recorded it in a churh apparently and the sound has a more intimate and natural quality because  of it. The theme is one of war as anybody would know but it is still an engaging record and one that one will listen quite often to. The main bleak theme does not render it unlistenable and the record ranks among her best.
0321701763|3.0|All of the Adobe Classroom in a Book products are really nice to use. They're pretty easy to read and it's really helpful that they come with lesson files. I'm a hands on and visual learner so I learn well on a computer so the lesson files especially are helpful.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|I didn't see that one coming! Whew. What a thrilling movie. Lately I find myself enjoying more of the \\"messing with my mind\\" movies. Maybe it's a phase I'm going through, but this one is thrilling and I can't wait to watch it again. Enjoy it over and over.
B00345A81O|5.0|I'm late to the party... I've just got caught up to getting this release.  I wish I'd gotten this sooner, it's outstanding live Bowie.  Every track, every song, top notch.<br /><br />There are plenty of other reviews to give you lots of details.  I just wanted to chime in on this.  If you're a Bowie fan, don't sit on the fence.  This is a must have release.
B001DJLD1M|5.0|this set is awesome. I so very much enjoyed having all three movies and the animie in one place. I have been able to watch one after another and it is wonderful. Buy it and enjoy it over and over.
B004G5ZXVQ|4.0|WOW!!! I CANT BELEIVE THAT AFTER ABOUT 15 YRAS OF RECORDS THAT SOUND TIRED AND FADED REM HAS MADE A COME CABCK. I'M SOOO HAPPY WITH THIS ALBUM . IT HAS THE SOUND OF AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE,OUT OF TIME AND MONSTER AND DOCUMENT ALL MIXED. THE SONGS WITH VEDDER, PEACHES, AND SMITH ARE AWESOME... GET THIS RECORD!! IF YOUR A FAN YOU WILL LOVE IT. KEY SONGS ARE OH MY HEART, ALLIGATOR ECT.... MINE SMELL LIKE HONEY (BECAUSE ITS CLASSIC JANGLE GUTAURS THAT ARE CALSSIC REM) AND IT HAPPENDED TODAY. IT'S REALLY MADE WELL AND FLOWS WELL THROUGH OUT ...GOOD JOB REM!
B002T9H2MO|5.0|what can I say. I suspect this is a movie you either love (like I do) or hate. I cannot pinpoint exactly what attracts me to this movie but I have watched it several times and love each viewing. To many it is probably slow. I didn't necessarily like 2001: A Space Odyssey because it was \\"slow\\" but somehow, for me, this is different. Maybe you should rent it first and then decide, but I have it and am happy to have it. Enjoy.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|The songs on \\"The Promise\\" never get old just get better. Watching the concert from 1978 in Texas or watching the performance of \\"The Darkness On The Edge Of Town\\" in 2010 in the empty theater the magic is still there.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I love Harry and the gang. This movie never should have been in two parts. It just was dragging on and on. I understand why the production companies wanted it split so they could make more money, but come on. Give your audiences a break. I am looking forward to the second part though. Hopefully it won't be cut short to make up for the first one. I don't think Harry should have gone \\"out on the big screen\\" this way.
B000I5X81A|5.0|Absolutely spectacular.  Two of the greatest guitar players of our time (who tag-team each other brilliantly here), excellent production, plus an added bonus of terrific keyboard work (including Billy Preston).  If you're thinking of buying this, don't even hesitate - go for it!
B002ZG980U|5.0|this is such a great \\"mind blowing\\" movie on so many levels - and yes that is a spin on words. This movie is amazing and keeps you on the edge until the very last second. The first twenty minds I was completely confused and ready to give it up but I was watching it with my two granddaughters and of course I wasn't going to cry uncle first and I am so glad. It is a thriller all the way through. Watching it over and over is a must. I hope you enjoy this as much as I do.
B002NZK5TG|4.0|I greatly enjoyed this movie.  I was expecting it to be one of those \\"it's so bad, it's good\\" films, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It's just plain good.  Who knew Rick Moranis could sing so well?
B002GIBVV6|5.0|I saw bits and pieces of this movie on tv so decided to order it - only - because it has Maggie Smith in it. I am so glad to have it. She is one of my top 10 actresses so am always happy to include anything of hers in my collection. The movie is great and all the other actor(s) are equally great.
B001NESPHC|5.0|Wonderful disc!  Melody Gardot writes songs most of us could only vaguely imagine.  Her words, her voice --- sheer perfection!
B004DMIIVO|5.0|One of the greatest animated films I've ever seen. Beautiful characters, visuals, action and most importantly, beautiful story. Its truly a work of art!
0385341008|5.0|A charming book, filled with interesting characters each with a compelling story. At first I was uncertain about the letter form but soon found it captivating.
0670022411|5.0|I normally don't buy trilogy books before they're all available. And I wasn't aware that this book was the 1st in a trilogy, or I would have waited. That said, loved the 1st book. Bummed I have to wait on the next two. I was totally caught up in the story & didn't want it to end. If only they would put a rush on publishing these books...
0061743526|3.0|I actually enjoyed this book. For a classical book, it really isn't all that boring or difficult to read. It starts off a little slow in the beginning, but it gets a lot better if you give it a chance. Scout is a great choice to narrate the book, because since she's the youngest, her perspective on their world is a lot different, younger and more innocent. I think it's really humorous to read her views on adult issues, because she doesn't always understand them. If it were Jem or Atticus narrating the book, I don't think it would be as good.   Even though some of the language used in the book is a bit confusing, it isn't enough to where you don't understand what you are reading. It took me a while to read this book because you have to concentrate on the words to really comprehend it; you can't just fly through it and expect to understand it all.  I think parts of this book are really sad, like how racist people where to blacks back then. I mean, we're all human, aren't we? What does it matter what we look like on the outside? Being different does not make you a bad person.   Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good classic to read.
B002QGUFWE|1.0|I would give \\"Lady Gaga:  The Fame Monster\\" 4 stars, but since I want my review to be noticed, I decided to give it 1 star to give it more visibility.  \\"The Fame Monster\\" is a superb product.  However, the music that accompanies Madonna's singing is tighter, with more varied and interesting phrasing.  Every one of Madonna's songs are very distinctive, whereas Lady Gaga's are a tad less so.  All in all, in the last 30 or so years, I would say that Madonna is the #1 female pop vocalist, Deborah Harry (Blondie) and Pat Benatar are tied for the #2 spot, and Lady Gaga is #3.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|... and dumped a load of You Know What on the American and Global Economy, and the most famous disciple of Ayn Rand's objectivism, Alan Greenspan, is still walking free, if not held in quite the reverence of yesteryear.<br /><br />Of course \\"they\\" are all walking free, as director Charles Ferguson fiercely observed upon receiving the Oscar for this documentary: most prominently Summers, Rubin, Bernanke, Geithner, with a host of lesser inside-jobbers who continue to play musical chairs in key positions Wall Street, in DC, and in the economics departments of American universities. They are the Janus-faced deities of finance, both the regulators who scorn regulation and the regulated who refuse to be so. My Mexican law school Latin comes back to me: quis custodiet ipsos custodes - who guards the guards? But the French proverb would be just as apt: qui s'excuse s'accuse - he who excuses himself accuses himself.<br /><br />\\"Inside Job\\" tells exactly the same story -- of the ideology-driven deregulation of financial institutions during the presidencies of Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush, and sadly Obama, and the resultant economic meltdown, featuring exactly the same cast of characters -- as the book I recently reviewed, \\"The Great American Stickup\\" by Robert Scheer. There are another dozen books that tell the same true story, largely because it IS the story, and I don't think this film tells the story as coherently or as convincingly as the books. Honestly, however, the majority of Americans today, however inflamed their political passions, will not be reading the books, and might not find the most thorough of them easy going. So the film potentially serves a need, to reveal to all the outsiders just what the \\"inside\\" has been doing. I hope everybody in the country sees it. I hope it plays on Fox. I hope one of the networks picks it up and makes a weekly series out of it ....<br /><br />In fact, it needs to be a weekly series. It's too fragmentary and too 'entertainingly' edited in quick cuts. Too much is implied, not enough is made boringly explicit. If I hadn't \\"read the books\\" myself, I don't know how convincing I would find this film. This is the era of the nano-attention span, of course, but I worry that ideological apologists for greed will be too able to quash this indictment on 'procedural' grounds, as they were able to flip off Al Gore's film about climate change. You can't be content to tickle and amuse an objectivist or a free-market extremist; you need to stake 'em to the ground. And just to show me snippets of an interview in which one or another arrogant academic economist acts evasively or lets his greed show will not be sufficient to convince me, or anyone, that he's also completely wrong in his ideological premises.<br /><br />The portions of the film that 'exposed' the revolving door relationship between the known culprits -- Wall Street and DC -- and the most ivory-towerish academic communities (of Harvard, Columbia, etc.) were, for me, the most significant revelations. Charles Ferguson, through the voice of narrator Matt Damon, asserts unequivocally that the financial industry has corrupted and co-opted not only the state and federal governments but also the whole academic discipline of economics, reducing the 'dismal science' to a dismal shill.<br /><br />This film is just a teaser, an appetizer plate of sordid scandals. Like the audience at a strip tease, I want to shout \\"Take it off! Take it all off! Show us what you've got!\\" Let's hope, nevertheless, that it fires up people to learn the whole story.much is implied, not enough is made boringly explicit.

B0034G4P7G|4.0|This is movie-making at it's highest level. A terrific film, yet I don't know what the heck was up with the sound. During all the club scenes the background music deafened the conversations - it is very distracting.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Simply an awesome DVD for an awesome show. Instead of just having a commentaries for a couple of episodes, the DVD has one for every episode. The other extra items work fine as well. Definately buy, not just for the quality, but also because renewal of the show may come down to merchandise sales.
B004Q6FNEW|5.0|I was not a huge fan of Turisas' last two albums, because I do not enjoy the half-growl werewolf style vocals of Warlord Nygård. However, on this album, these vocals are not as prevalent and are more tolerable. Instead, he sings normally more. The lyrics on this album are a continuation of the concept from [[ASIN:B000R7I2HY The Varangian Way]], about vikings in the Varangian Guard in the Byzantine Empire. The full orchestra and choir are utilized well, adding an epic element to each song. A song by song breakdown is as follows:     (parenthesis show the order that I like them, for example (1/9) is my favorite song on the album and (9/9) is least favorite)           1. The March of the Varangian Guard- My second favorite song on the album. A great chorus and orchestration. (2/9)      2. Take the Day!- Epic with great utilization of the choir in the chorus, although one of the most growl-filled songs (6/9).       3. Hunting Pirates- A good song to listen to while hunting pirates. (9/9)      4. ! - - Best orchestration on the album, but the vocals, although limited, are all growly. (4/9)      5. Stand Up and Fight- Catchy chorus and epic as always. (3/9)      6. The Great Escape- Good orchestration, but no chorus. The vocals are good though. (5/9)           7. Fear the Fear- Decent song with a growl-infused chorus. (8/9)      8. The End of an Empire- The longest and most epic song on the album. The choir is amazing. (1/9)      9. The Bosphorous Freezes Over- A great way to end the album, but not an incredible song by itself. (7/9)    Overall, this whole album is definitely worth having. Each song is good. You will probably like this if you like Rhapsody of Fire, Battelore, Celesty, or Blind Guardian.
B000026OWF|5.0|If you listen to this cd, I'll let the music justify my rating.  It could be rated higher than 5 stars.  There's nothing left to be desired with the fresh creativity and the flawless arrangements of these 6 songs.  I love the collaboration of various guest artists here, such as: Stevie Wonder on Harmonica; Louis Johnson on Bass; and Wayne Shorter on Soprano Sax.  Leading the way, is Herbie Hancock's artistry on Acoustic/Electric Piano and Synnthesizer.  His play takes me to another planet. I do not exagerrate when I state that Herbie Hancock is THE best synthesizer player in history. This album was a classic when it first released in the '70's, and it remains so.  Jazz quality isn't this creative anymore, in my opinion, but to each his own.  This jazz is \\"smooth\\" enough for me, and hopefully for many others.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|I'm not going to sit here and write a review on the movie... so many others have done that before me. All I'm going to say is that it's an amazing movie.  To sum it up - GREAT MOVIE - GREAT PRICE especially for Blu Ray!
0131103628|5.0|Among all the books introducing a specific programing language,  K&R's \\"The C Programming Language\\" is absolutely the best one. It is strict, clear, clever, precise, and self-contained. It is really a classic of all the classic computer books.   Highly recommended!
0545265355|4.0|Great quality set of books. Well worth the price. Hard cover and sturdy.  The author writes in a way to capture your attention over and over again. I especially like how she writes in the present tense. It makes it very personal to the reader.   I very much enjoyed reading these books and I hope others do as well.
B003I55BIA|5.0|I loved this book! With Alex and Brittany you could see the spark between them but then having the side aspects of their lives. To me this was a great book I didn't put it down till I read the last page and then went on to read the sequel about Alex's brother Carlos. It was a great description about the gang violence and what it takes to get out and about having to deal with family problems.
0061726826|3.0|Set in a future where love has been blamed as the cause for almost all forms of health issues and even wars, scientists have found a way to cure love with a treatment performed on all members of society when they are around the age of 18 years old. Having watched her mother and sister fall victim to \\"Amor Deliria Nervosa\\", Lena can't wait for the day her treatment is performed. Then she meets a beautiful boy, and begins to question all she was taught to believe.<br /><br />Delirium is a book I wanted to love. I saw the rave reviews and everyone gushing over its amazingness. Now I find myself pondering was it that hype that caused it to fall short? I know others loved this one, so please refrain from throwing tomatoes. It had aspects I truly did enjoy and those I didn't. The idea of love as a disease was a fascinating one, but when the author delved into descriptions of mothers that were so detached from their children they showed no emotion when they were hurt, I had to ask myself how did these same babies survive infancy. I guess I'm from the school of thought that the unconditional love I feel for my children is one of the driving forces behind my need to comfort and care for them. Take that away and will I be able to nurture in the way the child needs? I suppose basic needs can be easily met, but that still leaves the emotional needs all children crave. Children want their parent's love and acceptance, and all the parent's in Delirium could offer was bland indifference. I hoped by the end of the book I'd be a believer, but it didn't happen. I just couldn't shake the feeling that denying these children love would lead to even more problems, or maybe I'm just over thinking it ;)<br /><br />The first 150+ pages was so bogged down with world building for this complex idea that the pace moved very slowly and my attention was swaying. The main characters were lackluster at best. By the time I reached the end Lena and Alex hadn't left much of an impression on me. Lena seemed to be such a strong advocate of \\"the cure\\" initially, I had trouble believing she would abandon it all so quickly over a boy. Once plot twists began to come to light I found I was much more interested. The author really has a beautiful writing style, but I need more action and a somewhat plausible explanation for the state of the world when I read a dystopian novel. I imagine her contemporary novel (which I have not read) is absolutely stunning if the flow and pace are similar to that of Delirium.<br /><br />Will I read the next? Yes! I truly hope that now that the world has been set up, the next book will focus on answering questions and solving the mysteries that popped up over the course of Delirium. I'm also very interested in what lies outside the fences of civilization. I hope the next installment will trigger a case of \\"Amor Deliria Nervosa\\" for me the way it has for so many other readers.such a strong advocate of \\"the cure\\" initially, I had trouble believing she would abandon it all so quickly over a boy.

0142429104|5.0|This book is real talk. This mom knows what it takes to excel in this world, not just get by. Some sensitive people may not be able to handle the direct and frank language. But I was able to see past the authors curtness and marvel at the discipline she posses and instills in her children.
0316098337|4.0|Room by Emma Donoghue is the story of Jack, a five year old, who is held captive in a one-room shed with his mother in a man's backyard. Together they plot their escape and must learn to live in the real world. Oh, and the title for this review will make sense once you read the novel; I'm not a cavewoman<br /><br />Good Stuff<br />- The perspective of the narration is creative and fresh, told by the perspective of Jack. He has never been exposed to \\"the Outside\\" and his view of the world is much different from ours (or even a child his own age).<br />- The plot itself is engaging- I had a hard time putting the book down, curious to see what happened to the two characters<br />- Jack's character is able to draw a great deal of emotion out of the reader- I became protective of him as I read the story, wanting him to safe, happy and well-adjusted. There are moments of humor, love, confusion, fear, and frustration.<br />- The juxtaposition between inside the room and outside is astounding, making you question how you acquired even the most basic facts about the world around you.<br /><br />But (always, right?)<br />- Once out of the room, I felt at times that the plot was a bit rushed and that things were a lit too smooth.<br /><br />I had a difficult time deciding whether or not to give this book 4 or 5 stores (halves, Amazon, halves- let's get on that, please). I think what held me back, though, was the last half, and the neatness of the ending.
B0039Q7QKE|5.0|Any Star Trek fan has gone through the typical Star Trek junk that is sold. This Command Division Badge is worth a look. It is solid with 2 pins for support. The design is authentic Star Trek. It's appearance is subtle yet demanding. It will not disappoint.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a tragic, yet compelling, story where reality television has morphed into something much more sinister. The Games are part Survivor- if you replace the castaways with children called tributes who battle each other in a gladiatorial fight to the death. It is also part of the makeover shows where those same tributes are fed the best foods and dressed by the best designers. The Games are a political tool in the post apocalyptic world, designed to keep the population of the remaining districts in check. The main protagonist is Katniss, one of the tributes from District 12. She is faced with many challenges, with the odds stacked against her from the beginning. When her sister is randomly selected as the tribute, Kantiss steps in. Within the Game itself, the government controls situations to make for better entertainment. It is heartbreaking watching her try to survive the Games without losing her identity.  While this would be enough for a gripping story, Collins throws in the personal struggle of sorting though her feelings, specifically in regards to Peeta, the other tribute from district 12.    Kantiss is a pawn, but what a pawn she makes. At times she is ruthless, at others truly compassionate. She is a well-created character, and more than capable of carrying the story. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the books!

B002N5N5LG|5.0|I do not watch TV. I hate commercials and much of the programming is dreck.<br />That said someone pointed out that this TV show had done an episode where the characters had played Dungeons and Dragons and I HAD to see it!<br />So I watched the episode online and laughed out loud. I showed it to my family and laughed as I watched it with them. Then sight unseen I bought the first season. T Here were many moments when we were laughing so hard we had to pause or rewind so we could hear dialogue.<br />I don't imagine the humor is for everyone. Much of it is rather sophisticated puns and cultural references, or movie parodies. Then there is plain old slapstick by Chevy Chase who is not too old to fall over stuff (still)<br />I eagerly await season 2!
0143118706|3.0|This book is a terrible disappointment after her last book, E P L.    It is very interesting to read about 'marriage' and its history.  Makes me realize why I never wanted to remarry.    But where is her trust, where is her faith, where is her flow, where is the good story, that she had when she kind of gave up and let go of the outcome and went on a search for herself.  She found some love, and then had to make it 'make sense'.. .or something.  if you like to read dissertations this is for you, if you want to read about true love after disaster...then forget about it. Very stilted writing, no heart in this writing.
B001EKP5FK|5.0|My son needed the dvd for \\"Prince of Tides\\" for a school independent reading project (comparing the book to the movie made from the book...he needed a physical copy of the book, and we don't do enough movies to subscribe to Netflix.)  Since We've lost all of our video retail stores around here, we only have the \\"Blockbuster Express\\" and \\"Red Box\\" at our grocery stores.  They don't cut it on finding older classic movies like this, but Amazon came through for us and we had the dvd the next day after ordering it.  Fantastic movies, fantastic service, darned good price.
B0041KKYEM|3.0|I really looked forward to this movie, hoping it would be Natalie Portman's break out role, but alas it was little more than [[ASIN:B001TOD92C The Wrestler]] with ballerinas.  Aranofsky has no knowledge of how the ballet, much less the creative process, functions.  What he tries to create is another visceral experience, filled more with \\"wet dreams\\" than any sense of dance or the stage.  Since Natalie is obviously not much of a dancer, we see this production almost entirely from behind her right shoulder.  Symbolic perhaps, but downright annoying when it comes to seeing any dance.  Of course this movie is not about dance, it is about poor Nina's painful metamorphosis, as she tries to shake the claustrophobic world of her mother (Barbara Hershey), who had forsaken dance to have her, and get past her own limitations of \\"perfection.\\"<br /><br />Mila Kunis adds a little intrigue as Lily, but Aronofsky uses her as little more than a sexual foil to Nina's growing ambitions.  The ballet master might as well have been played by Piers Morgan, as he does little more than frown and genuflect when Nina fails to give him the \\"black swan\\" he so much desires.  He taunts her into masturbating, supposedly to unleash the sexual energy he is looking for in the role.  Portman spends most of the time looking lost and confused, not sure where Thomas (Seymour Kassel) is going to go next, until she finally gets her moment on stage and literally becomes the black swan.  Although I have to say I was impressed with Winona Ryder's portrayal of Beth.  Ryder is virtually unrecognizable, and gave the character more emotional energy than any of the other actors did their characters.  In the end this is little more than a children's story with some steamy scenes for adults, fading out exactly as had The Wrestler.

B004GHYCKW|4.0|If you're a fan of PJ HARVEY as I am you'll  like this album.I was thinking that many of the songs have to do with ENGLAND (hence the title I guess)and Americans may not relate but it's still an enjoyable listen thanks dennis

B004DI7HZ6|1.0|i should've known better when i read that this was \\"twilight\\" for adults. 3/4 of the way through this i caught the author interview on npr. i was aghast at the caller gushing. this book is tripe. i have no problem with guilty pleasures, but to compare this to twilight actually does it a disservice. this book is a trumped up high brow bodice ripper. read phillipe gregory's stuff instead. at least you'll get some history. i paid for the damn thing and im forcing myself to finish it. i wish they'd all die.
B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|First, I have been a fan since out of time came out (I was just a kid at the time) and I have faithfully followed R.E.M. ever since. I own every single album they have put out, and stayed with the band after Bill Berry's departure. I can honestly say that this is the most cohesive album the group has put together since he left (a sentiment many have shared in other reviews). I would also like to echo the sentiment that this is their best effort since New Adventures in Hi Fi - the album I regard as the best they have ever released. I know many will not agree with that, but I still listen to that album all the way through and love every song on it. It was weird, it was loud, it was cool - it combined everything that made R.E.M. great and came out at a time when some truly fantastic music was being released. I believe it is the most underrated album they have ever put out and its a shame because it is brilliant.    While Collapse Into Now does not fall into brilliant territory (yet) that is something that only comes with time. I can say that after downloading a bunch of the free singles leading up to the album release, I was anticipating this album more than any release the band has had in the post Berry era.     The entire album is good, the only truly weak spot I think is at the very end. Where Accelerate started strong and then lost steam halfway through, Collapse Into Now keeps things going and takes you on a journey through some of R.E.M.'s greatest moments: there are shades of Automatic For the People, Monster, Hi Fi, and some of the best moments from Accelerate, Reveal, and perhaps a touch of Around the Sun.     Every album they have put out has had some gems on it, the earlier stuff more so than the recent - but this album is strong and it will grab any long time fan in a way that only R.E.M. can. Stipe puts in one of his best vocal performances in years and Buck also hit it out of the park on this album. It's not perfect and no album is, the lyrics can be weakat times and the last song is just OK - but I was not expecting a masterpiece, I just wanted some awesome tunes from a band that I love and that is exactly what whey delivered here. I would recommend buying this without hesitation.
B003VMIGM8|5.0|I think it is fair to say that this is a bi-sexual erotic thriller and they should have label it that way.  That said, (I did not see the original french movie) but the \\"acting\\" performances of both ladies is great! Much better for Amanda than \\"letters to Juliet\\".   Julian Moore is better than ever as, i'm pretty sure, it was not easy to play.    As for the story, it was obvious at some point that Chloe was lying but Catherine Julian) wanted to have the \\"unforbidden\\" relationship so she decided to not look into the obvious.    I keep wondering...what did you expect guys??
B004132HZS|5.0|I bought this DVD and wasn't certain if I liked it at first, but I'm a person who can watch a video over and over again. The more I watch it, the more I like it. I just wish there were more episodes to watch. I'm looking forward to the next DVD.
B004BBDHEK|3.0|I have \\"followed\\" Yanni since the early days.  I attended one of his concerts when he still performed with only a small band of six or seven.  I have \\"Out of Silence\\" on lp. That was Yanni at his best.  Then he decided that bigger was better.  It wasn't.  Then he decided he needed more variety, like some vocals.  Most of them haven't worked very well either.  I like that Yanni doesn't have a large orchestra muddying up the works this time.  However, he still displays the incessant urge to add too many flourishes that distract rather than enhance.  And the vocals, as usual, don't work very well -- in fact not at all.  So I'll rate this CD \\"OK\\" for the title song, which is one of his best in years and for general effort.  However, that's as high as I can rate it.

1416955070|3.0|City of Bones is the first book in the Mortal Instruments Trilogy by Cassandra Clare.  It tells the story of Clary, who one day wakes up able to see downworlders and the Shadowhunters who hunt them.  Within twenty-four hours, Clary's mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by demons.  Soon Clary and her best friend Simon are drawn into the world of teenage Shadowhunters Jace, Isabelle, and Alec.  While all the adults are away signing peace accords in the Shadowhunters' home country of Idris, the teenagers must solve the mystery themselves.  They travel to the Bone City to try to unlock Clary's memories, track down a warlock at a downworlder party, and fight their way out of vampire lair.  Interspersed with this, we learn more about their world and the events which led Clary's mother to abandon it fifteen years ago.<br /><br /> To start with, I really enjoyed City of Bones.  It was a good story, fast-paced and well worth the time to read.  I noticed a lot negative reviews of this book around amazon, and while I agree with many of their points, it didn't stop me from enjoying the story overall, and I wouldn't recommend it stop you either.  While it's not the most amazing book ever, it kept me extremely entertained for the day it took to read it.<br /><br /> Although I enjoyed the book, there were certainly parts that annoyed me.  One of the most common reasons for the low reviews is Clare's references to things outside of her story, such as Jaida Jones or the characters Val and Luis from Holly Black's novels.  While this kind of writing might be fun in fanfiction or more personal stories, it feels out of place in a published story.  In addition, many of Clare's own characters seemed to be lifted from other works.  In particular, Jace is practically a carbon-copy of fanon Draco, and the kindly werewolf uncle is familiar too.  Many reviewers also noted the similarities between Clare's characters and those from Buffy.  I haven't seen Buffy myself so I can't comment, but I wouldn't be surprised.  Despite this, her characters are fun to read about.  I love the character of fanon Draco, and Clare's rendering of him is as fun to read as anyone else's.  Still, I can't help thinking that some things should be left in fanfiction.<br /><br /> For the most part, the writing and dialogue in City of Bones was fun and witty, but I have two complaints.  One was that Clary's ignorance of the Shadowhunter world was used over and over as a prop to insert explanations.  While it was certainly interesting to learn about the world, doing it this way felt clunky and became old really fast.  My other complaint is that Clare often used big words seemingly for no other reason than to sound impressive.  I have nothing against long words, but these didn't seem to fit with the rest of the writing and felt jarring, rather than enhancing the story.  It felt as though they were there simply to say, Look at me!  I can use big words!<br /><br /> The last problem I had with the story was the existence of the demons.  Downworlders like the warlocks or the fae I found interesting, but the inherent evilness of the demons seemed too simplistic to me.  I know demons are common to many fantasy stories, and I have this complaint most of the time they appear.  In my mind, creating characters who are by nature evil takes away depth from the world created.  To Clare's credit, the main antagonist was not a demon but a Shadowhunter like the other characters, but I still wish there was more reasoning behind the nature of the demons.<br /><br /> As I've said before, despite these complaints I really enjoyed City of Bones, and I look forward to reading the next books in the series.  I thought the world Clare created was colorful and interesting, though I am curious how much of it came from Buffy.  I enjoyed the physical descriptions of the people Clary meets (such as the vampire girl with blue dreadlocks), the banter between Clary and Jace, and the fact that Clare included a gay character.  Even if parts were clich&eacute;, it was definitely worth reading.f parts were cliché, it was definitely worth reading.
0756404738|2.0|I've waited anxiously for this book to come out and hope to pick up the story where The Name of Wind Left Off.  The book just didn't go anywhere.  The first 25%-50% went nowhere and could have been completely left out of the book for the story to progress.  I could understand if he took this time to progress the characters but they didn't really seem to go anywhere either.  The second half of the book was more original and interesting and as opposed to other reviews, I enjoyed Kvothe's time in the fae.  So many of these scenes and interactions were very anticlimactic and ended with a whimper instead of a bang.  Overall the story didn't seem to take the characters to a more interesting place in time and space or in development, and it shouldn't have taken 1000 pages to get them there.  I'll read the next book but I'll won't be waiting for it like I was this one.
B00351YEVC|5.0|I heard this book being reviewed on our local radio Sydney 702. It far surpassed my expectations, a book with an ending which is so dramatic yet so telling on the spirit. For me this is a must read book for all.
B003J27WFW|5.0|I liked the showing of Rush's Beyond the Lighted Stage on VH 1 Classic but when reading their entry in Wikipedia I thought that there was something incomplete. It does not mention the role Jeff Jones played in the early inception of Rush. Most Rush fans do not know that Geddy Lee is actually the second singer/bassist and frontman of Rush. The original line-up of Rush consisted of Jeff Jones on bass and vocals, Alex Lifeson on guitar and John Rutsey on drums. Jeff Jones left the group before their second live performance and was replaced by Geddy Lee after several incarnations of the group. Jeff Jones would go on to play bass in Tom Cochran's Red Rider group and is seen in the group's video for Lunatic Fringe. He was a member of a Gospel rock band called Ocean in the 1970's and had a minor hit called Put Your Hand In a Hand. I don't know if the film's lack of mentioning Jeff in the early incarnation of Rush was because he is Black or because he was in the group shortly but I thought that was unfair to Jeff Jones and to diehard Rush fans. Anyways it was a good film but people in charge of the script should get their facts straight before putting out a film a group as big as Rush. Thats my two cents worth. I'll buy it at some point this year but I will be unsatisfied for a long time considering the exclusion of Jeff Jones' name in the film
B003UESJHO|5.0|If you're a die-hard boxing fan, how do you not love \\"Irish\\" Micky Ward? Okay, he didn't have that showy personality. He wasn't much for strutting. He wasn't the most skilled or talented pugilist and his defense was practically sieve-like. What he was was an honest fighter, and time and again in the ring, in dishing and doling them lumps, he revealed resolve and character. Nothing like being in the squared circle to distill the essence of a guy. Irish Micky Ward always gave you your money's worth. Micky's one obvious claim to brilliance was his left hook to the body, one of the most murderous go-to weapons I've seen in boxing. See, he liked to set it up with a left hook to the top, quickly followed that up with the left crunch to the body. He knocked down many a fella with that combination. So, here's Micky, an honest, humble, blue-collar slugger from Lowell, Mass. - and totally deserving of getting his story told. THE FIGHTER is terrific stuff. It allows the viewer a peek into this introverted boxer's personal life.<br /><br />It's great to see Mark Wahlberg's persistence pay off. He fought tooth and nail to get this movie made, and a heap of Oscar nominations proves him right. Mark plays Micky Ward and does him justice, but then again Wahlberg is best when he's playing these working class characters, and you'll root for him one more time. How dedicated was Wahlberg to this role? In the on again, off again history of this film maybe or maybe not getting made, Wahlberg continued training even during his other film commitments. It familiarized him to the hurt business, at least well enough that he looks convincing there in the ring. His left hook to the body looks very similar to just how Micky threw it. Those familiar with Micky Ward's career will note that this film stops short of Micky's classic trilogy with Arturo \\"Thunder\\" Gatti, which is a shame because I would've loved to have seen Micky and Gatti's friendship explored onscreen. We also miss out on Micky's unbelievable toe-to-toe war with Emanuel Augustus. But it's clear that the film's intent is to chronicle that crucial juncture in Micky's life just before he brawled his way to the big stage. It's about the building blocks that got him there.<br /><br />Man, it's so surreal for me watching a biopic of a guy I used to follow whenever he was fighting on television. THE FIGHTER tracks Micky Ward's life from 1993 to 2000, but that's taking liberties with them facts. The first fight we see Micky in is his disheartening, mismanaged loss to Mike Mungin, which actually took place in 1988 and not '93. The film climaxes with Micky's thrilling win over Shea Neary. In between those two bouts, we watch several themes playing out: the dynamics of a dysfunctional family, the meaning of brotherhood, the overcoming of doubts, of honest toil and perseverance, and, ultimately, redemption. And, yeah, this family is so dysfunctional they should be the poster children for the definition of the term. We take stock of a drug-addicted half-brother (who happens to be Micky's unreliable trainer) and a domineering mother (who also manages Micky's boxing career). And also a gaggle of sisters, sometimes played for laughs. The film chronicles Micky's romance with Charlene (Amy Adams, always fantastic), the impudent bartender at his local bar. It says something about Wahlberg and Amy Adams' genuine chemistry that I don't feel the film really takes off until Micky decides to take control of his own life, and this is due in no large part to Charlene's support of and impact on him. Micky was this close to quitting boxing forever.<br /><br />It's a hell of a casting coup, if you haven't glommed on yet. Melissa Leo as Micky's mom is damn memorable, whether you like her or not. But without a doubt, the king scene stealer here is Christian Bale who plays Dickie Eklund, Micky's half-brother and an ex-boxer who had his shot at greatness and whiffed. Bale, looking gaunt and haunted, is mesmerizing in fleshingout the combustible Eklund, and he goes back to THE MACHINIST days, losing scary weight. Bale sinks into the role so completely and is so good I'm actually a little cheesed because his performance at times wrests the spotlight away from my man Wahlberg. But there's no denying that Bale and Wahlberg's interactions are as key - if not more key - than those between Wahlberg and Adams.<br /><br />THE FIGHTER piles it on, it does. But schmaltz lies at the essence of an underdog feel good story; you just can't escape it. But the story is good enough and grounded enough - and the performances certainly are top drawer enough - to kick sentimentality to the curb. In a neat bit of trivia, the same HBO film crew that shot Micky's original fights were hired to shoot the film's ring action, with the original HBO fight commentary tacked on for added believability. Disappointingly, the fights aren't so memorable, and maybe it's because I've actually seen the live versions of the Alfonso Sanchez and Shea Neary bouts, and then the epic barn-burners Micky had with Augustus and Gatti. But, it turns out, even though this movie is about a fighter, it's not so much about the fights in the ring. My saying that THE FIGHTER could only hope to have the heart of the real Micky Ward isn't me putting this movie down, because it's very much worth watching. It's just that I think so very highly of \\"Irish\\" Micky Ward. I just never expected to see him in a love scene.<br /><br />This single DVD also has director David O.

B000QYATTC|5.0|I bought this album on cassette back in 1996 when I was visiting Asheville and i really enjoyed this album, especially when travelling through the mountains of North Carolina. It kinda reminded me of the mountains of Bavaria in Germany, from which this band comes from. Anyways, I decided to buy this album on cd and I was elated to have a few bonus tracks from the Judas EP but I was disappointed to not find the track Save Us on this release. I really enjoyed that particular track that was on the original release. Had I known that I probably would have gotten the original version with this track on there but otherwise I am satisfied with this re-release. I also have to highlight the fact that this is the last Helloween album to feature Kai Hansen on co-lead guitar before forming power metal band Gamma Ray. It is also the last Helloween album my collection. Needless to say, their post- Kai Hansen stuff has been mostly power pop rock junk and not the burgeoning power metal that made them famous in the mid to late 1980's. Last but not least this album contains their second and last hit song I Want Out. That said I will probably look for the original version of this album with Save Us on the track listing but otherwise this is a good reissue of the last Helloween album that could be considered a classic.

B003UBTX72|5.0|An excellent choice!  Transports a younger Stones fan like myself into an era you only hear about in VH1 specials.  Enlightening, crass, and humorous, what strikes me most is the unwavering dedication to the art of Music and to the people he holds dears that drives everything Keith does.  Guitar players will love the technical tips Richards doles out.  Definitely not for the faint of heart as it does use the most blunt language in dealing with everything - including death, sex, and detox. :)

B000P12LWY|2.0|I am like many of the people who did not like this series--a serious student of British History, with particular interest in the Tudors. I saw this program advertised years ago and my first impression was \\"IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE HENRY VIII?\\" Right then it lost me. No offense to Mr. Rhys Meyers, but he is woefully miscast as Henry VIII. Physically, as others have stated, Henry should be tall and fair. He also was about five years younger than Catherine of Aragon, who also should be auburn and fair. In this program he looks around 25/she about 40..    I think the biggest problem apart from the miscasting of Henry (I will allow the other physical types to be 'wrong') is that they played with history BIG time. The whole concept of creating some sort of European Union or whatever the supposed Treaty they were working on smacked of 21st century politics, not 16th Century...I kept saying, \\"WHAT?\\" The whole merging of Mary Tudor (sister of Henry) into this Margaret person (Margaret was a separate sister married to the King of Scotland) was a stupid and unnecessary digression. I suppose the writers screwed up by placing Francis 1 on the throne before his time so there was 'no old man' to marry in France. Moving the whole plot to Portugal just makes no sense. I also do not think the Holy Roman Emperor EVER visited Catherine and Henry (he was far too busy ruling all his territories).    After awhile the gratuitous sex got annoying. Did people really hang outside the chambers listening to the king have sex? Were Henry's courtiers allowed to address him as 'mates' and 'equals?' Did Henry have sex with some Princess from Navarre or wherever she was supposed to be from?     Henry was no Charles II...he was pretty loyal, from what I read. I don't believe he had mistresses all over the place unless he intended to marry them (Anne, then Jane..and so on..).    Bottom line, yes, the series could be addicting if you like it 'just as a story.'  But as history, it's rubbish.
B002BGFUPQ|5.0|i'm a die-hard fan of fast and furious fanchise ( own 4 movies, all blue ray of course ) this's no boubt the 2nd best FF movie ( orginal one always is the best ) followed by tokyo draft, 2 fast 2 furious and the last one-fast and furius. the 4th one in my humble opinion is the worst one: there's not alot of racing. like 5 minutes in the middle and last 15 minutes of mostly CGI. worst yet the car: i've no problem with american muscle cars( i'm an american citizen btw:) ) but i always love and a hard-die fan of Tuners ( my favorite are RX-7 bathurst-in yellow and Evo 8 in black )
0307474712|1.0|This book turned out to be one tedious experience, with characters who doesn't develop, witty dialogue which isn't really witty, and a narrative arc that goes on in the same flat and repetitive way year after year. It didn't make up for an interesting read. Or like the book's target audience would say, \\"I'm just not that into this\\".  I skipped several tracks (listened to the audio version) to see if the prose would pick up or the very unlikely pairing of womanizing good-looking immature Dex and plain, intellectual Emma would get interesting at some point, but that didn't happen.

B004ISVH7U|5.0|Normally, I am not a fan of landmark \\"anniversary\\" reissues since most suffer badly from the desperation of artists and record companies seeking one last profit squeeze from their old catalog. The formula is simple - remaster the music but lard up the offering with decrepit video and audio outtakes that should have remained untaken and out.    While that motivation may be in play here, the reissue of BOTW is done with extreme care - the re-mastering is superb and the companion DVD feels less like a cobble of random video and more like a well thought out expansion of artistic vision.    The video is terrific but when you get right down to it - these releases are always about the music. \\"Bridge\\" remains an extraordinary recording, providing S&G's generations of fans a compelling reason to rediscover its many virtues. It should come as no shock that with vastly improved production clarity, the stature of the title track - IMHO the single best vocal performance(s) in popular recording history - is only enhanced, however, to my ear the shimmering soundscape of The Only Living Boy In New York remains the emotional centerpiece of the album.    A vital addition to any collection.
1591843162|5.0|Seth Godin making magic and delivering very practical metaphors and ideas to paint a clear picture on why we do what we do. I feel like the chapter on Resistance alone could be broken down to more detail and turned into a bestseller. This covered a lot of similar principles that Dan Pink and Steven pressfield (The Art of War) discuss.<br />Seth Describes the Lizard Brain as a part of our brain that tells us to take it easy and will go to great measures of excuses to prevent us from taking action with being creative. The idea of \\"shipping\\" really resonated with me as well... this idea of starting a project, initiating a project/idea, and actually pressing the send button (shipping). So powerful! Practical but effective.<br />After finishing the book you realize that the generation that we have been brought up in has been conditioning our minds to be followers and really limit our creativity. This book should help people that feel like they are living for an actual purpose and want to bring some creative energy to the world for a better cause!

0434019259|5.0|Don Winslow's [[ASIN:0307278913 Dawn Patrol]] and this sequel, really combine well,  beach, especially surfing culture, and the traditional crime thriller.  Sort of what I expected the new Hawaii 5-0 TV program to be which ended up just being a real disappointment.  You won't be disappointed with The Gentlemen's Hour though, it's a laid back well written main character driven read.  You don't need to have the first novel in this series, The Dawn Patrol to enjoy or understand this novel as it is a completely separate plot.  The main character and some of the other characters are in both so I guess if you want don't want to know who survives the first novel when reading it, then read that first, but other than that, this is a standalone plot.<br /><br />Former cop, Boone Daniels is a surfer, his life revolves around that.  He has a lot of outside pressure that he should follow the more normal way of life and take up Law school or something more worthy of financial success than what he does, which is private investigation work.  Boone is struggling to pay the bills, but as long as he can grab his board and has the friendship and respect from his fellow mates of The Dawn Patrol (early morning surfers at his local beach) and The Gentlemen's Hour (older surfers or those such as himself that don't need to obey the 9-5 clock after the Dawn Patrollers have gone to work), then Boone thinks life's pretty sweet.<br />However when a defence lawyer he wants to bed, convinces him to take on the case to dig for the truth and help her rich, spoiled teenage gang member wannabe thug client who is charged with the murder of an old legend in the surfing world, through a cowardly king hit, his beach mates who mean everything to Boone start to shun him. Boone hates the client as much as his friends but has no idea if his life can ever get back to the way it was, but is determined to uncover the full story of what really happened on the night of the murder.  Boone's also been asked to trail his rich fellow Gentlemen's Hour surfer's wife, to see if his suspicions of her having an affair are real. He hates that kind of PI work but does really need the cash to pay the bills, especially since everyone in the surfer community is making him pay full price for everything now.<br /><br />A fun read, Boone does get out of a situation a bit too conveniently near the end for complete satisfaction, but other than that minor disappointment, you'll enjoy this from the first page to the end.fellow Gentlemen's Hour surfer's wife, to see if his suspicions of her having an affair are real.

B004I2K4E8|5.0|It's amazing to me to see so many differing opinions on these two concerts of a show most all who are writing adore in one way or another.  To say one is MUCH better than the other is strange to me.  Being a fan of the show, I find it impossible not to enjoy both to a very high degree.  To dislike one or the other is incomprehensible to me.  Remember, I am non-expert fan of Les Miserables....not unlike most who are reading (and writing) these reviews.    I prefer the 25th Anniversary concert because of the technically superior audio and video production of a modern DVD.  Actually, I have not seen the DVD - I purchased the Blu-ray, which is EXCELLENT.  This brings up a point I think important for the reader who is weighing a purchasing decision:  writing a critical review of the DVD/Blu-ray based on a viewing on PBS television is not quite fair.  I have not seen this on television, but from past experiences, what is broadcast on PBS is often missing content and/or the sound is not nearly as well re-produced.  If watching on a television with no special sound (no amplified 5.1 setup), then the 25th Anniversary DVD edition loses one big advantage.   It still has superior video in any setup though.    A little perspective:  the 10th Anniversary is called \\"The Dream Cast\\".  The 25th Anniversary was not called \\"The Dream Cast 2.0\\".  They are 15 years apart.  The Dream Cast was presented during the show's heyday.  Today, Les Miserables has lost popularity and isn't performed anywhere near as many times live as it was back in the day.  With both concert versions, the producers have apparently chosen to select performers who have had a relatively recent history with the show.  After 25 years, how do you come up with another \\"Dream Cast\\"?  This is a major disadvantage for the 25th Anniversary version, and all things considered, I think they did a spectacular job in selecting the newer cast.    Now, what about the actual performances?    Valjean - Colm Wilkinson & Alfie Boe:Nobody \\"owns\\" a role more than Colm Wilkinson does playing Valjean.  This is not undeserved because he is simply awesome in the role.   In attempting to create a newer version of a Les Miserables Anniversary concert without Colm Wilkinson in the lead, is a daunting task I wouldn't want.  The producers found and were able to get Alfie Boe, and I think they found the perfect man for the job.  His rendition is different but not so much that it seems out of place.  Alfie's voice, without considering the role, is my preference over Colm's.  I like Colm in the role better - he's Valjean (and vocally, he's no slouch).  But Alfie blew me away this time around and is perfect for this updated version of the concert.    Javert - Philip Quast & Norm Lewis  Similar to Colm Wilkinson as Valjean, Philip Quast \\"looks\\" the part of Javert.  He's got a lot more than that going for him though.  His version of `Stars' is 2nd to none.  Add to that, Javert is my favorite character in Les Miserables.  Norm Lewis doesn't look like anyone's version of a \\"Javert\\".  After watching his performance several times though, he is becoming very much a \\"Javert\\" for me.  His portrayal is every bit as resolute as any.  His singing chops, though a bit different, are growing on me even faster than his evolving \\"Javert-ness\\".  His `Stars', along with his suicide, are highlights of the concert.....very much like any excellent Les Miserables show.    Fantine - Ruthie Henshall & Lea Salonga  Every performance I have ever seen of Fantine has been outstanding (or at least my memory says so).  Having owned the 10th Anniversary VHS tape - and later the DVD, I equate Fantine with Ruthie Henshall.  Nothing has changed that view to this day.  I would say that is VERY high praise of Ruthie (and not undeserved).  Lea Salonga, like Norm Lewis fighting against \\"cast\\" or stereotyping, is even better though.  I am floored by how good she is.  Not because she is different, but because she becomes Fantine and makes me feeleverything the director wants us to feel....and she does it with a style of voice I am more drawn to.  One thing I like about her is the way she finishes songs.  She holds the last note as long and as clearly as anyone, and the clarity in which she finishes the lyric adds an impact to not only the lyric but the entire meaning of the song.  Some say she over-emphasizes words, but the impact she gives to meaningful lyrics is something no one has ever been able to duplicate (for me).    Eponine - Lea Salonga & Samantha Barks  What more can be said about Lea Salonga? How much time do we have?  Eponine is my 2nd favorite character in Les Miserables, and like the performances of Fantine, I have never been disappointed by an actress/singer who I have seen live or heard professionally recorded.  Anyone know who played Eponine in London around October 2009?  Whoever she was, she was awesome and reminded me of the original Eponine, Frances Ruffelle.  Lea Salonga's Eponine is my preferred choice though (every bit as good as her Fantine too).  Listen to the last half of `On My Own' from the 10th Anniversary concert for another example of what I mentioned above about finishing a song.  Wow.  Samantha Barks was unknown to me, and she pretty much blew me away as Eponine.  When it's time to let the emotion of the song go, she lets it fly with the best of them.  Her voice is clear and powerful, and her Eponine fits in perfectly well with all the other fantastic performances I have witnessed.    Marius - Michael Ball & Nick Jonas  Ah, the one everyone either loves or hates.  Michael Ball is deservedly the greatest Marius anyone has ever heard - there is no competition and no comparison.  Nick Jonas takes a ton of heat for \\"not measuring up\\" to any of the current cast, let alone to Michael Ball.  I don't disagree.  However, if you have made it this far, you know my opinion on everyone in the cast is pretty high.  Nick Jonas was not brought in for all the 12-year olds that will be watching.  He actually had an affiliation with the show.  And not just playing Gavroche as a small child....he actually played Marius in the West End in London.  Maybe that was a bit of a ticket-inducing ploy (to 12-year olds), but I think his appearance in a concert version of the show is not wholly appalling.  I would like to get reviews of 100 people who have never heard of him.  My bet is the bulk of them would not be nearly as brutal as many here.  He's not great, I get that.  He does do a fine job in areas though.  His `Empty Chairs and Empty Tables' compares in no way to that of Michael Ball's.  But on its own merit the performance is completely watchable, if not quite good.    Cosette - Judy Kuhn & Katie Hall  Never cared for this role.  Don't quite know why.  In re-watching the 10th Anniversary concert recently, Judy Kuhn's voice impressed me.  I am still not impacted by the songs in the same manner as most of the others though.  Katie Hall pretty much was the same - that is, she was impressive:  very nice voice but songs still don't quite work for me.    I will stop with the individual comparisons - except to say I preferred the Thernardier's in the 10th Anniversary version.  Recall, Jenny Galloway reprised her role in the 25th Anniversary - and was just as good a Mrs. Thernardier.  Also, the two actors who played Enjorlas (Michael Maguire & Ramin Karimloo) were both excellent in their respective concerts.    I guess I should wrap this up.  One thing I want to address is some of the silly or thoughtless comments some make when criticizing.  To say Nick Jonas ruined the entire show is just shameful and discreditable.  How many minutes is he on screen?  To say Lea Salonga is too old to play Fantine is ridiculous.  She was all of 39.  Patti LuPone, who originated the role, was 36 when she started playing Fantine.  Judy Kuhn, who played Cosette in the Dream Cast, was 37....37 as Cosette...you know, Fantine's daughter.  She returned to Les Miserables (on Broadway)as Fantine at 49!    People bring enough preconceptions on their own....unreasonable comments don't help anyone and do a disservice to everyone.

B0009P5YXO|3.0|I really liked this sonic screwdriver replica. The only aspects I was disappointed in were that it only operates at 2 heights: all the way down and all the way up, and that the sound was only at one pitch. I think if they made it so the pitch went gradually higher as you slid the extention up, then it would be a lot more fun and realistic. Otherwise, I really liked the toy. It's very Doctor Who. I would give it a 3 1/2 star review for fun if I could. I don't think it deserves to be shunted down to a 3, but I also don't think it makes the cut to be bumped up to a 4. I would recommend purchasing it though. Especially if you have kids that are into Doctor Who. I think they would enjoy it despite it's degrading qualities. Although it does mysteriously seem to get people irritated when you use it all the time.... Overall, I think it's a good purchase to make, for yourself or for someone else.

1401307787|5.0|This book is about being in the present.  It contains over seventy short lessons on mindfulness and meditation from what I believe is basically a Zen Buddhism viewpoint but which are useful for anyone regardless of religious or spiritual orientation.<br /><br />Mostly, each little chapter contains an anecdote plus help on how to apply and use the information, frequently in the form of questions to ponder.  Sometimes, there are also related quotations from a variety of sources from Thoreau and Whitman to people from India whom I have never heard of and whose names I cannot spell or pronounce without great difficulty.<br /><br />With such a wide range of lessons, this book is useful to people with various degrees of familiarity with mindfulness and meditation and the art of being.  My approach has been to flip through until something catches my eye and then to study that little chapter in depth.  It has proven helpful in reducing stress by encouraging and supporting me in being more mindful.
0061537969|3.0|\\"The car goes where the eye goes\\"<br /><br />Enzo is nearing the end of his life when he reflects on his past with Denny, Eve, and Zoe.  Oh, and he happens to be a canine too.<br /><br />I Liked:<br />If I had to choose one word to describe this book, it would probably be \\"engaging\\".  This book, even in the sections I didn't like, really kept me interested and wanting to read it.  And that is very hard for an author to do period, but to be able to keep my interest when A) I am pretty sure I know what is going to happen next and B) I am upset at the characters/plot/whatever?  That is impressive.<br />I know that previous compliment probably sounds more like a two-edged sword.  This book actually has a lot going for it: good characters, engaging story (as I mentioned above), and fluid writing.<br />Our main character is Enzo.  What makes him particularly noteworthy is that he is a dog.  I must admit I was afraid that he might come off as too doggy, too foreign to be able to associate with.  Huh, I was sure wrong!  Enzo is a perfect blend of foreign dogginess (his escapade with the crows, his revenge on the Evil Twins) and humanity (his empathy to Denny, barking twice to \\"Go faster!\\").  I really liked the thought that our pets (animals in general?) may have this sort of knowledge of their surroundings.  I have a cat, and sometimes, she sure acts like she knows EXACTLY what is going on.<br />The other character I really bonded with was Denny.  Denny went through hell and back in this book, and his journey was cathartic in a way (Even if at times, he was incredibly stupid...see below).  Seeing him persevere when it would be easier to give up, to continue his dream to be a race car driver, even in his thirties was encouraging to say the least.<br />I won't go too much into the engaging story, because I kinda detailed it above.  However, I want to add, I actually liked the inclusion of race car driving into the story.  It made nice symbolism, and I actually liked learning more about race car driving (and I am not a big racing fan).<br />As for writing...it was easy on the eyes and good on the soul.  I breezed through this book.  The narrative was very effortless, and even the more introspective passages didn't get so belabored in their pedagogy that I grew frustrated and had to skim/skip the sections.  Plus, I felt I actually learned something new!<br /><br />I Didn't Like:<br />I liked a lot about this novel; one thing I didn't care for was its gimmick.  This book would be no different than hundreds of other literature novels about families that go through crap and come out victorious in the end were it not for the fact of the canine narrator.  And in many cases, the canine narrator wasn't used to the fullest.  It would have been wonderful to have more scenes where Enzo got to play in the park; one of the greatest scenes was where a significant character dies and Enzo runs off and kills a squirrel to unleash his emotions.  That was great because we compared his way of mourning to the other human characters around him.  But most of the time, Enzo is almost too humanized and the story just becomes yet another family trial story.<br />I could almost forgive the book that.  Enzo wasn't a bad narrator.  And a story has to have conflicts.<br />But this is where my greatest complaint(s?) lies: the ever increasing amount of conflicts and the stupidity of the characters involved in said conflicts.  It was bad enough that we learned about a character's illness by page 50 (50! In a 321 page book, that is a mere 15% of the way through the book), but must we endure said character (who is probably barely in his/her twenties) then REFUSING any medical help whatsoever just because he/she \\"doesn't want to deal with it\\"?  Why must the conflict be introduced so quickly, before we have ANY time to enjoy being alive and a family?  Why does this young character insist on not going to a doctor and possibly getting a treatment?  This is never explained!  And now, we as the readers must endure all these \\"happy\\" scenes, which get tainted by the fact that we can guess that this ailing character will die by the end of the book.  Thank you for forcing me to refill my Prozac prescription.<br />But worse than this was the rape accusation.  The moment the teenaged girl tried to force herself on Denny, I knew something bad was going to happen.  Several pages later...BINGO!  Denny is arrested for rape.  I nearly wanted to quit reading this book, it frustrated me so badly!  Not only does Denny have to suffer with the earlier crap (and I'm not even getting into a quarter of it, for fear of spoilers!), but now a molestation lawsuit?<br />And the problem is, Denny being a race car driver, not being wealthy, and being away from his family is enough of a challenge without adding 101 billion more conflicts.  To tie back into my first complaint, this smarts of a gimmicky \\"intellectual\\" novel.  I can see the checklist right now:<br /><br />Character has cancer?  Check.<br />Character is going to die?  Check.<br />Molestation lawsuit?  Check.<br />SPOILER SPOILER?  Check.<br />Creative gimmick to make people think this is a different book than all the others?  Check.<br /><br />Ah, with that out of the way, we can get this off to press!<br /><br />Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:<br />A few f-bombs, da**, sh**, he**.<br />Denny and Eve are intimate with each other.  A significant portion of the plot is dedicated to the (false) claim of rape.<br />Someone is hit by a car.  Someone dies from a terminal illness.<br /><br />Overall:<br />I must admit, I've reached the end of my review, and I'm not 100% sure what to rate it.  The book angered me in places, so I considered a two star, such as I rated the pretentious \\"Time Traveler's Wife\\".  However, unlike the \\"Time Traveler's Wife\\", we don't have pages upon pages detailing all the punk bands of the 1970's or the exact moves in a pool game or how many times the main couple have sex.  As I said before, Enzo is pretty good narrator, he often has some very interesting perspective, the story was very engaging, even when it angered me, the theme of this novel comes out really loud and clear, and the ending is most assuredly not God-awful depressing.  So, I think three stars is a good rating.  It's a decent book, but be prepared for some teary-eyed moments.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S.

B003AYDPYQ|5.0|A friend recommended it just as AMC started replaying the previous seasons, good timing, I can't get enough.  The beginning is a bit over the top at times, but that's Hanks new life, crazy.<br /><br />Unlike most TV shows and many movies, there are points in the show on a regular basis where you really have no idea what will happen next, refreshing compared to the typical sitcom or drama on most networks.  The cinematography and imagery used in the show is outstanding, keeping it interesting.  There are flash backs and flash forwards, often you don't know which while you're watching it, but not so confusing as to make no sense.

B003G4W49C|1.0|I can usually breeze through a 600 page book in as little as 2 days ( I sleep like 4 hours a night and read really fast), I've finished a 7 book series in 7 days, I've finished a 352 page book in under 12 hours, they were that good. This book took me over two weeks to finish and the only reason I did was because I generally can't NOT finish a book once I've started unless it's truly horrendous. That being said, although not horrendous, this book had it's moments.<br /><br />From the start I felt uncomfortable with the story because the author drops you in the middle of the situation with no backstory, then a wholly inadequate one is provided at different intervals of the story, perhaps there is a prequel that I'm unaware of? The writing is simplistic, the author doesn't seem to believe in transitions, one minute Ender is in his bed playing a game, the next he's having a conversation with someone. Well, how the hell did he get there? The writing is just choppy and the scenes are disjointed and lack flow, I usually hate prosy reads, but in this case I would have highly recommended it. I found myself just reading so that I could say that I'd finished it and wasn't a quitter. I also read the first of the Homecoming series, the writing was better, the backstory was better even if character development was nil, however the heavy handed religiosity was just too much for me. In browsing through the authors books, I came across this one and decided to see if I cared for the author in another setting. I'm sorry to say that I do not.<br /><br />Like another reviewer said, I think that this book is now famous for being famous. To think that this won a Nebula Award for best book which casts it in the same league as Parable of The Sower by Octavia Butler, Tehanu by LeGuin (whose writing style I dislike as well, but who tells a good tale) and Dune by Frank Herbert is frightening, because it's vastly inferior to the works of any of those authors. I'm actually kinda mad that I spent the money on this book that I could have used to purchase and re-read Dune.

Its like the feeling you have after you have an epiphany, while electrically shocked. This could be THE best possible way ever to end a book series. I know it doesn't fit the standards of others, but I was very impressed. Too Impressed. This book had action, love, regret, sorrow, hate, pain, and an ENORMOUS amount of imagination.

It has melancholy, tragedy, pain and darkness along with hope, tenderness, compassion and wonder.  The tight melodies are rocking, bluesy, jazzy and rootsy.  Lucinda simply just knows how to create lyrics and deliver the imagery - not much more to say other than she is blessed with talent.  I was particularly moved by \\"Soldier's Song\\" and \\"I Don't Know How You're Livin'\\".  I find myself tapping along to \\"Ugly Truth\\" and swaying and rocking with \\"Convince Me\\" and \\"Buttercup\\".

To be honest, the plot line and characters are nothing amazing...just another textbook story.  With that said, if you are a movie fan, you'll be able to excuse that for the cinematic mastery by Director Tony Scott.<br /><br />And of course, it is hard to pass up a movie with Rosario Dawson in it.
1582701709|1.0|This book may be one of the worst I have ever spent time with. Their are no actionable suggestions on how to improve your life--just a rambling conspiracy theory about a secret that all the smart people in history knew. Formal logic or objective information rarely comes into play. If you are looking for a book that can help you put yourself on a better track to success, this is not it. If you are looking for something funny that you can ridicule, The Secret is for you. One exception to what I have already said is that an aspiring author will probably get a huge amount of confidence from this book. If this fraud can get a book published, you can too.

B000Q66JXA|2.0|I love this movie, and couldn't wait for it to be released on Blu-Ray.  The transfer is sadly horrible - the framing of the movie chops off more heads (or whatever is at the top of the frame) than the Load High Executioner (yes, I checked to make sure I wasn't accidentally setting the TV picture size to an artificial wide-screen size), and the images are grainier then a \\"normal\\" DVD, and just ridiculously un-sharp for Blu-Ray.  If it weren't for the packaging, I'd swear this was a cheap rip-off bootleg.
140191716X|5.0|My boyfriends mom gave me this book for Easter. I have to say not only is it a beautiful book with beautiful illustrations but the daily messages are really great and uplifting. Many are words we should live by. It is very inspirational and a nice thought that you have a special guardian angel by your side to guide and help you with your life. It may sound kooky but I love the book and the messages it has. Will be purchasing for my mom! 5 Stars!!!!!!
6305161992|5.0|In some ways this was your standard white samurai/ninja story and really I usually hate those movies but somehow having Dolph Lundgren as the white samurai it made it ok.  Also it was interesting seeing Brandon resist the temptation to beat everyone up as easily as I'm sure he was able.  It was very much like seeing the Green Hornet but the having the Green Hornet guy actually be dangerous and have the Kato guy follow the role.  Sadly seeing this made me think how wonderful it would have been to see Dolph and Brandon do the Green Hornet movie.  It would have been amazing.  But hey, this was great fun.  Loved it.

0956827810|5.0|This book will undoubtedly become a great companion in the millennia old philosophical debate about whether or not you actually can judge a book by it's cover.
1591843162|5.0|Everyone should take a look at this book for a fresh perspective on how the world work today. Unlike his other books, Seth gives this one from the heart.
B002ZG981E|5.0|This is hands down one of the best movie i have watched in 2010. Although it did take me watching it 2 or 3 times to actually understand the movie, it was brilliant and heart throbbing. I watched it at the theater the first time and i did not even take out my eye drops even though i always have to put on eye drops when watching movie at theaters. I did not dare to look down and look for my eye drop or go to the bathroom and miss the movie. This movie is extremely deep and breathtaking. Every detail was designed carefully and actors and actresses presented very well. You have to watch it if you haven't, you won't be disappointed.
0756404738|5.0|If you've read the first book, buy this one.  Rothfuss has the best prose I've ever seen, and the main character Kvothe is so fleshed out you easily forget that you're reading a work of fiction.
B002VPE1PW|5.0|I bought this to protect my iPad when it's in a backpack or other larger carrier, and it is exactly what I needed.  Perfect size and seems to be of good quality.
193413712X|1.0|Not at all a fan. I read this book b/c my med school writing dept. purchased 100 copies of this book with my activity fees, so I thought I might as well. Things I liked about the book: only 191 pages (although it seemed like 400), large print, small pages, pretty looking cover. Things I didn't like: incredibly boring, sentences shouldn't be longer than a page, tangentiality, absence of character development, difficulty in discerning who was doing the narrative. One only needs to look at the price that people are asking for their used copies on Amazon to realize that people don't want to hold on to this book for a second read through.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This is a great game for family night.  My 23 year old son and 21 year old daughter both really enjoy it.  It is not, however, suitable for 5 year olds - it should be rated for 10+ year olds.
0984158480|4.0|My husband wanted to read this book for a long time.  He grew up in post-war Europe, and has always been interested in World War 2.  He knows German, so he chose to buy the original German edition, not a translated version.  Because of the way it is written, it is not an easy read.  However, he is glad to have it and is enjoying it as much as one can enjoy this type of book.
B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|I was so glad REM got their Rock legs back with \\"Accelerate.\\" The new release \\"Collapse Into Now\\" boldly continues the march back from the loss of drummer (and song writer Bill Berry). Although I don't think they have ever released a \\"bad\\" album, the last two are a return to their previous vitality as one of rock's longest enduring and most creative acts. Thanks guys. Great album.
0307346617|5.0|Max Brook's tale of the Zombie Apocalypse is absolutely gripping. It's been years since I've read a book that truly capture my imagination and made me feel a bit squeamish or made me think about the big \\"What If?\\"<br /><br />Told through the eyes of the survivors of World War Z and The Great Panic, Brooks paints us an account of what happened (or what could happen) in the face of the living dead reanimating and fighting back against the world. We learn about the origins of the plague, where it started and how it spread, the panic that ensues, the war that humanity wages to take back the Earth, and the after effects of the battle. The amount of research alone that went into this book will have you tipping your hat to the author.<br /><br />If you decide to start this book, be sure to clear your schedule as you won't want to put it down. For fans of post-apocalyptic stories, horror, and zombie genre, take a few days to slip into a dangerous world where no one is safe. See how the world falls apart and then joins together to rebuild itself after a global tragedy.<br /><br />As I finished World War Z, I could only think that if or when the dead decide to reanimate, I hope the US Government has Max Brooks on speed dial, because he's the one who will leading the armies and getting us all out alive.
B003INBNXO|5.0|Excellent martial arts action, actors/actresses, storyline! Donnie Yen is da man!!! Get this movie and add it to your collection.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|I had heard this film was good.  Though I admit that I am a sucker for horse stories, I was nevertheless surprised at how good it is.  Diane Lane is superb and the story is compelling.  I do not know how historically accurate it is--and I mean just that, I don't know--but it is very well told.  It certainly drew me in.  I cannot think of a single scene that was not well done.  I would recommend this film to anyone.

B00475AYJQ|5.0|I have read several reviews of Wise Man's Fear, and like many, I have waited a long time it. Like other readers, I reread The Name of the Wind several times, and like other readers, agree that it is one of the greatest fantasy stories/characters I have ever read. Because of the wait and the build up,(much like Kvothe) the ever-growing, legend/mythical persona builds it to something enormous. I get the sense that some people are reading Wise Man's Fears through that scope. If you do you will be left at the end with the comfort that you just read a REALLY great book but not a legendary one.    Instead, read it as it is...an extension of a story; the second act of a three act play. A second act is very often about the character not reaching the goal/solving the problem and is instead about gaining the skills necessary to do so. This second book is just that. Kvothe (SPOILER POTENTIAL) gets no further in his quest for the Chandrain but does continue to gain skills towards what is needed to become Kvothe in the inn.     Furthermore, it is often hard to remember that Kvothe is teenager. While life experience has left him wiser than most, he is still prey to his fundamental teenage desires. I mention that because some people have suggested that the sex in the book does not fit the character and I would agree...if Kvothe was a 40 year old character. Since he is a teenager, it is no wonder that the world of sex is new and exciting to him. In fact, he mentions several times that women and love were all new and confusing. This is not 15 year old Kvothe from NOTW who is shy with women. This is a growing, smart character, who is starting to notice and be noticed by women. What teenager could not be caught up in that in one way or another?    Through this Patrick Rothfuss continues to prove that his is a true wordsmith. Good prose is like good music; there is a rhythm, a cadence, and a structure. The masters of writing, like the masters of music, can take those elements and moldthem into something unique and special. Rothfuss is one of those masters. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and look forward to the next. My only wish is that the third in the series comes sooner rather than later.
B00004RF9B|4.0|This classic science fiction movie is well before its time in its visual effects and music to match its futuristic view of a planet that was the home of an alien race that had one fatal flaw before it vanished.
0786891084|3.0|The story idea is a good one, but I think it could have been written out better. By the middle of the book I couldn't wait to get through all the boring stuff just to see if they got together. If the book wasn't on my Kindle I would have thrown it across the room. I don't think this is one I will reread.
B0030V0PEW|4.0|This book argues the benefits of preparing and following checklists for medical procedures and surgeries. I had a major surgery a few years ago which resulted in a serious infection. This book was an eye opener for me and helped me understand how and why things go so wrong in hospitals. I always assumed that some sort of operational checklist is used during surgeries. I was shocked to know that it's not the case. It is disappointing that Dr. Gawande and those who share his approach have to convince the medical profession to adopt checklists, something that is so common in less complex professions. Governments and health agencies have the responsibility to mandate and institutionalize checklists in hospitals and clinics. This book is a good read no matter which profession you belong to. Checklists help you to organize your work and reduce errors.
B004FGMV0W|5.0|This album, ( To sum it up in one word) Is...PERFECT! I love every single song on this CD. There is only one song that i do not like As well as the others...(Stop Standing There) But i still like it. That is something to say, because her in her Past albums, theres been atleast a couple songs, that i wasn't as fond of. I have Been a MAJOR FAN of Avril since The Day LET GO was on shelves. This album has some songs on it that remind me of a couple on Let Go, and brings back wonderful memories. Wish you were here, is ( In my Opinion), The Best Song on the Album! It's so catchy, and really speaks to you. I bought this album the first day it came out, as with avrils other CD's. Every Single Song on this album will get stuck in you're head. Avril Is Such a wonderful Role-Model, and A Really Great Singer. I Cant Wait to Snag some tickets for this summers tour! So, if youre like me, and absolutely Adore Avril Lavigne, and really Enjoy her music, Go pick this album up, I Promise, You will not be Dissapointed.
B000URDE2Y|5.0|This is of course Trower's most famous album and its strange to try and figure out why. His first 3 records all sound alike but for some reason I guess most think this album had his best set of songs. And that very well might be. Its a masterpiece for sure but its also another case where an artist or bands other albums which offer more variations on their masterpiece are overshadowed. But onto the album. Released inn 1972..it was his biggest hit reaching #7 in America and featured heavily in all the rock trades at the time. The album opens with the epic Day Of The Eagle, a storming rocker who's blitzing intro segment lets you know, something powerful has arrived.     This takes us into another of the bands trademark dream like slow burn songs..the title track, its an amazing song that features a blowing wind sound that segueways into the next song In This Place. These 2 songs take you into another place, another dimension. Trower's wah-wah guitar work overdubbed ontop of a clean strum/pick riff with sparce drum fills and the concentrated vocals of James Dewar really make this an absolute classic. It makes you wanna just sit and close your eyes and be taken away from reality. The band creates that magic feel over several of the albums cuts including the rocking Fool And Me, featuring some great guitar rock in the solo section. You can tell a classic album when almost everyone of its tracks are essentials and appear on the compilations and reissues. Too Rolling Stoned, the 2nd half of the album, almost equals Day of the Eagle in its blistering rocker nature. A track that just melts your mind with how good it is and also, has a nice funk feel to it in the bass and wah wah guitar playing. About To Begin is another nice dip in the action, once again showcasing Trower's tasteful guitar prowess. Lady Love boosts us back into that hopping rocker mode that the band can evoke so nicely. What shoulda been another radio hit it has all the elements (complete with cowbell intro).And the album is brought full circle with another of Trower's  standards, Little Bit Of Sympathy, a grooving heavy rocker that is what great inspired hard rock is all about.    One of the best things about the album besides the songs, was the crisp production. When played loud, few bands sound as good as this stuff does. The duties were handled by fellow Procol Harum member Matthew Fisher. This is Trower's best album for sure and not only that its a classic of 70's guitar virtuoso influences and hard rock in general. Anyone looking to revisit any great but more rare bands of the time. This album should be in the top 10 easily.
1569242739|5.0|This book is soooo great!  I personally try not to eat much sugar due to health issues but now that I have two sons and they have birthdays and DEFINITELY want yummy cupcakes to be included I feel so good about being able to whip out some vegan ones!  I am a poor baker but every cupcake I've tried has come out so good I was amazed!  AND everyone in my family got this idea that I was a GOOD baker.  Nonvegans were surprised that the cupcakes were vegan.  Also, as someone on a healthy diet, there are other options in here!  Yay!  And suggestions for alternatives for the white sugar.  My 5 year-old son loves to look at the pictures and help me in the kitchen!
0439023521|5.0|This book is truly easy to love.  The characters in the book are painted in such a beautiful way that you never want to put the book down.  The book introduces Katniss, a name which I love, the main character in the story.  It leads you through her world of doubt, truth, heroism, and eventually love.  She is a hunter by nature and get pulled into these \\"hunger games\\" with another character from her district, in which only one can survive. I will leave it at this and let you read the book to judge for yourself.
0452286751|2.0|Actually I'm a big fan of this:  I find the character of Roark very inspiring, I'll admit.<br /><br />But when you read it as an adult you kinda know why people say it's better to read it before you're 20.  After that it's bound to strike you as a bit silly:  basically 700 pages of Roark \\"staring intently\\" at everybody.
B000GLDOXS|5.0|Being a Vietnam vet and a Marine I know a little about combat and the realities of same. This movie \\"brings it\\" with both story line, casting, portrayals, etc. Mel Gibson is excellent, Madeleine Stowe was great, and Sam Elliott was outstanding. I personally felt Greg Kinnear was best supporting. The movie, while intense told a story that needed to put out there, much like \\"Full Metal Jacket.\\"   Randall Wallace did a great job on the screen play script.  Harold G. Moore, who wrote the book \\"We Were Soldiers Once... and Young\\" as Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore .... well, there isn't much more that CAN be said.
B00005AQE8|5.0|This album is my favorite album of all time. I decided to purchase the album rather than just download the songs because I wanted to have something to hold on to and take with me everywhere this world takes me. I definitely recommend this album to any Tupac, or rap fan, it is definitely more than worth it's cost even after 15 years of its release. Keep supporting amazing quality music and artists.
0525423273|5.0|This is one of those books you can't put down when you pick it up. You NEED to know what happens with Anna and Etienne.    The characters are so well written and realistic that I felt like I was reading about old friends instead of characters someone made up. They made me laugh (A LOT), they made me mad (equally as much) and most of all they made me happy!     While I'm talking about characters, let's talk about Etienne St. Clair. Back in August I read The Sky is Everywhere by Jandy Nelson. I was pretty sure no character would come close to what I felt for Joe Fontaine, but I was dead wrong. Etienne St. Clair has everything Joe has, and an English accent. (Sorry Joe, but you can't compete with that. And no, I don't care that you speak French, because so does Etienne! Ha!)     Enough about Etienne, because I could probably go on forever. Let's talk about the setting. Perkins has every detail of Paris down. I was there on my honeymoon, but she still managed to make me believe I was experiencing the city for the first time.     I'd say this is probably the best book I've read all year.
B004I2K4DY|3.0|We just saw this on public TV. While it was a very nice job, I do not think it rates as high as the 10th anniversary production. The lead female singer is excellent, but I did not think the lead male carried quite as much impact as the 10th anniversary. In addition, the finale was a bit disappointing. For those who have seen the 10th, you know it ends by having lead male singers from many countries - Germany, Japan, Spain, etc. sing in their native language!  It was awesome. The 25th ending had the top leads from the early days and current productions, but nothing like the 10th year. In addition, I had a hard time understanding the young female lead - she was too near the mike and the young male had too much of an English accent for an American audience.  I liked it, but not enough to give it more than a 3.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Despite the many poor reviews I read about this watch, my experience has been awesome. I was worried about having the same probelms but I find it very easy to use without problems with the bezel. This watch was well worth the money and has greatly helped with my training. This is my firt GPS watch, I had been using the Nike+ system for a few years, but there is no comparison. This watch is extremely accurate, easy to use, and fits well. The heart rate monitor is also quite comfortable. I was debating whether to purchase this watch or wait for the Nike+ TomTom GPS to be released but I decided to stick with Garmin's trusted products. It's nice to have the option to run in something other than Nike shoes now.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Oh Where To Begin!!!!  The best compliment to give this true work of art is that it means more and more with each listen. For the past 15 years I don't think a month or two goes by when this album doesnt work it's way back to my CD player only to be rediscovered. Kind of a wierd thing to say right....? If listened to THAT often how can it be \\"rediscovered\\". The answer of course lies within the complexity of the songs on the album, the placement of the songs on the album, and the moods the album takes the listener through.  When I bought this album back in the nineties I was a 60' and 70's classic rock kid, nothing but the oldies, modern music just didn't interest me that much. I had my reasons, but that's not the point here on this review. Anyway, one day flipping through channels I came across the promo video for the song \\"Today\\", and something happened. I put the remote down and just listened....stunned. THAT GUITAR SOUND!! It started out so pretty with the intro, and then it transformed into some butal distorted assault on power chords, yet it still sounded messy and beautiful at the same time. I'd NEVER heard anything quite like that. And those vocals, they were so strange, but interesting.  Later on that week at the record store, searching around I came across the album, even the Cover Art was mysterious and intruiging. I had to get it, see what was contained in the other songs!  The album didn't leave my stereo, or headphones, for about 5 months. It was all I listened to. And, it wasn't that I was obsessed with the music or the band, it was just so DAMN interesting after each listen. Each of these songs has so many different layers and elemnts that you just dont catch with only a few listens. The songs are almost like little operas with time changes, ups and downs, different emotions conatined, and each song bridges almost perfectly into the next. You just can't put it on for one song, it'll suck you right into the next one. Sometimes with a haunting little interlude.  I think one of the main reasons for my curiosity with this album was that I would consistanly listen to it with headphones, bringing me closer to the sounds and atmospheres that the album conatins. One of the legendary thing about this album is thatit has SO MANY layered guitar parts, so as a guitarist it makes for a very exhausting listening experience (see \\"Silver F*%K\\"), trying to figure out each part and layer.  Of all the songs on the album \\"Cherub Rock\\" is probably going to always remain my persoanl favorite, for all the reason listed above. The guitar lines on this song, I feel, are some of the best the nineties had to offer, and the drum intro gives the album a perfect start. Plus, it's just the 1st song I heard when i put the album on for the 1st time, and it had a huge musical impact on me, so I'm a little biased toward it I guess.  \\"Mayonaise\\" is a VERY close second, if anything beacuse of the dramatic changes in the song throughout it's run. It kind of comes back to what drew me into the song \\"Today\\", it starts out with a very good clean guitar line, that actually goes on for quite a while, it appears to be a slower ballad type song. Then half way through, somebody kicks up the volume, slams the distortion peddle, and BAM magic happens, the song turns into something completey different, yet it fit's perfectly together. Which in a way is a good discription of the entire album.  I assume that \\"Siamese Dream\\" has worked it's way into pretty much any rock/alternative music listeners collection. If it hasn't go for it, you wont be dissapointed, and if you are, give it a second spin, maybe with headphones, and concentrate on what it actaully happening in the structure of these songs.  Billy Corgan and The Smashing Pumkins made some fantastic albums after developing \\"Siamese Dream\\", it's unfair to compare those to this one because each one is it's own musical statement. However, I will say this, I dont think that any of the other ones have quite the same lasting musical impact as this one though.
0312600844|3.0|The author's second creation yields a wrenching, funny, and forgiving portrait of a Midwestern family (from St. Paul this time, rather than the fictional St. Jude). Patty and Walter Berglund find each other early: she is a pretty sports addict who is focused on the court and a little lost off it, and he is a stolid budding lawyer, besotted with her and almost burdened by his integrity. They make a family and a life together, and, over time, slowly lose track of each other. We see them casting their lot with the big issues of the time, from environmental activism, war-profiteering, and the Rock `n' Roll scene; they often seem melded, in a way, to those causes.  But the characters do have their distinctive voices, and the quirks that define them are memorable.  We can love and hate them like the real people we've known.  Their charm and goodness lives side by side with their flaws; and what makes them lovable is that they are known to us.<br /><br />As we follow the ups and downs of Walter and Patty, along with all the supporting cast of characters that gravitate to them in their various incarnations, from middle class life to politicking moments, we seemingly capture a snapshot of our contemporary world.  These characters almost seem representative, in a way, of how the society has evolved, grown, and altered itself over the years.  Their emotional lives almost seem to replicate the emotional temperature of the times, moving toward depression in those difficult moments of our country's economy and attitudes.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0312600844 Freedom: A Novel (Oprah's Book Club)]] was a book that had to be taken in gradually and over a period of time.  There were parts of it, mostly the section in which we are drawn into Walter's environmental issues, which seemed tedious to me.  I most enjoyed the aspects that focused on the personal relationships, delving into the past to showcase the elements that created the flawed individuals they had become.  Understanding the families from which the characters had sprung helped me to forgive their flaws and foibles and to feel empathy for the mistakes they made.<br /><br />Yes, the very long and meandering tale seemed to bog in the middle, but toward the end, I was extremely drawn in again, just as I had been in the beginning.  The story was a memorable one and deeply satisfying in many ways.  But because of the mid-section tediousness, I am awarding three stars.es from which the characters had sprung helped me to forgive their flaws and foibles and to feel empathy for the mistakes they made.<br /><br />Yes, the very long and meandering tale seemed to bog in the middle, but toward the end, I was extremely drawn in again, just as I had been in the beginning.

B0025T65GC|5.0|Definitely Devin's Funkiest & Grooviest release.  Absolutely fantastic.  Killer basslines on the early tracks!!    This album is completely different than Devin's other 'solo' work or heavier material with SYL.  This is a brilliant, unique album.  I especially like this sequence of songs:  Coast-->Disruptr-->Gato-->Terminal-->Heaven Send-->Ain't Never Gonna Win.  Great stuff!   \\"Winter\\" is a nice chilled out acoustic track.  \\"Trainfire\\" deserves recognition as a sorta progressive swing/rockabilly piece.  \\"Disruptr\\" is definitely one of Devin's coolest songs - best cut on the album.    Ki is probably my overall favorite DT effort.  Recommended.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|This is one of those classics I always meant to read, but somehow never got around to it until now. It's a free download to my Kindle, and I LOVED it. I could identify with every stage of life the girls go through, all their struggles, lessons and heartaches. Something every woman should read.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|Wonderful movie.  I am from Southwest Missoui, where Winter's Bone was filmed so I enjoyed it even more.    Very fast shipping.  Great to do business with.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|Like the Allman Brothers? Of course you do! Like the driving, rocking locomotive that is Gregg Allman\\"s voice? Yes and yes!! So naturally any CD he comes out with would be worth a listen, right? But this one is different. Buy this recording now! I guarantee you'll be playing it over n over every day for some time. First off, it's beautifully and tastefully produced by T Bone Burnette. Then, the bands accompanying Gregg are killer with stellar players, most notably Mac Rebenack (Dr John). The material is classic blues and R&B (Sleepy John Estes, Muddy Waters, Magic Sam and Amos Milburn tunes among others with great arrangements!). Finally, and most importantly, Allman's voice has achieved an emotionally mature depth of expression that will move you like it never has before. Singing these chestnuts, he makes you BELIEVE what he is saying! BUY THIS CD !!
B000SMWUPS|5.0|My youngest son was born missing legs and one arm. He uses a wheelchair to get around. Because he must use his hand to push the wheelchair it makes carrying anything, especially a drink tough. He is very independant. So I saw this and decided to try it. I attached it under his seat in front.  It works perfectly! He was able to carry a drink today, and he keeps hand sanatizer and other stuff in it. Because it's under the seat it's out of the way, yet handy for him. Because it swings when he goes up a ramp, it doesn't spill the drink. He is very pleased with it!
B004PUG7MG|5.0|Avril = Catchy Pop    That is exactly what this album delivers.  If you like Avril, you will like this album.
B002ZG98FU|2.0|Positives:  (1.) Ford's acting.   (2.) Some actually creative, not redux a thousand times before, funny lines.     Negatives:  (1.) It took me one minute seventeen seconds into the film to recognize a New York (or thereabouts) production. Why? Their sense of romantic comedy is always, always the same WoodyAllenesqe romantic stereotype with the same physical characteristics (Barbie/Ken doll mold) and mental inaptitudes hiding some never imagined talent held back by some uniquely NewYorker emotional insecurities and all taking place between buildings, apartments, restaurants and perhaps a park setting - as usual.   (2.) Cookie cutter acting (Ford exception).  (3.) Can't urban romanticism be creatively presented in some other way than the same same same fantastical way? It may sell but it's getting old.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I HATE jumping jacks. There, I said it!<br /><br />I'm in semi decent shape. I took 80 lbs off a couple years ago, managed to get into probably the best shape of my life BEFORE getting this DVD. Unfortunately put about 25 of it back on & lost diligence about working out for a while, but I'm back on the wagon & working myself back into shape. I initially bought this DVD to add to my rotation, thinking it would be a good way to change up the other things I do with yoga, belly dancing and weights. Too bad I hate jumping jacks.<br /><br />The good: Yes, these are good workouts, and yes, they will kick your butt. The breakdown is an interesting approach (3 segments of 6 minutes, 3 minutes strength, 2 minutes cardio, 1 minute abs). There are two girls to follow, one for the basic & modified versions, and one for the more advanced.<br /><br />The bad: Jumping jacks. If there is any one move in all of the exercise world that I despise above all others, its jumping jacks. And the quip about 'you won't find a modified version here, I have 400 lb people doing these' is all good and well... but that can hurt somebody if they're not careful! I don't particularly care for Jillian's methods of motivation throughout the DVD either. I thought I could work past it, because yes, it is a decent workout, and yes, you can benefit from it. However, as nice of a person as I am sure she is in real life, I can't play this DVD without wanting to throw something at her head. Sorry, Jillian, please don't take it personally. And have I mentioned I hate jumping jacks? To be honest I didn't get past level 2, and the dreaded jjs weren't as ubiquitous as they were in level 1. Lost patience and moved on to other workouts.<br /><br />Buy at your own discretion. If you can get past her attitude, or it doesn't bother you (and you don't mind those darned jumping jacks... really there aren't a lot of them, but I hate them anyway), its a good workout. But I've taken it out of my rotation and replaced it with Core Fusion, which I personally get more out of.th Core Fusion, which I personally get more out of.
B002M9WW30|5.0|If you don't own the complete set, then this is the set for you. The blu-ray quality is not as impressive as in other films. Nevertheless, if you're a fan like myself. Dishing out 40 dollars for 6 great films is a great bargain. If you have the original collection, probably not worth upgrading.

B004LGPBZI|1.0|That is what they should have called it.  When you don't have an original thought or ANYTHING to say, then it's time to accept the fact that maybe you aren't a talented musician.  Recycled insipid album.  They should   be sued by every Artist they stole from here.  There's influences and then there is downright plagiarism and that is clearly what's going on here. If you know anything about music you don't need to be a rocket scientist  to know that you've heard these melodies and guitar lines all before.  Sad indeed.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Good movie - just because of the great actors.  Not as great an action movie as I expected, but it was worth the money.

B00005JLEU|5.0|I bought this one for myself but I thought that my 11 year old daughter might like it too. My 6 year old son was playing legos when the movie started and was entranced within the first 5 minutes. It's his favorite movie now and we've all watched it again several times.     It's not scary or violent, and there are no bad guys vs good guys. In real life there are rarely bad guys and good guys, yet movies and television (especially children's movies/shows) would have you believe otherwise. It's a real joy to find an intelligent film that can be enjoyed by the entire family.

B003L77TZI|4.0|The problem with Katy Perry's first album \\"One of the Boys\\" is that there isn't a lot of songs I like, rather they were: Waking Up in Vegas, Thinking of You, UR So Gay, Hot N Cold, If You Can Afford Me, and Fingerprints. For the \\"Teenage Dream\\" album, there's a lot more songs I like, including: Teenage Dream, Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.), California Gurls, Peacock, E.T., and Hummingbird Heartbeat. Okay, so it's still a tie but still... I like Teenage Dream a lot better because Katy Perry has changed a lot and the album cover picture is really beautiful like an angel singing out in the clouds. So if you agree, please respond to this product review! :)
B004FQKY5Q|5.0|I have followed Roxette for 20 years, and their latest Disk, Charm School reminds me so much of their early material.  They are my favorite band.  Per Gessle is a prolific musical genius.  It has gotten to the point that I dont need to hear his material before I buy it.  I buy first, and just know I will like it.  I love to play back-up on the piano to many of his songs.  Gessle's style is unmistakable, and paired with Marie Fredriksson, I think they are one of the best musical duos of all time.  I have had this record for less than a week and I say there isn't a bad song on this album. Keep an ear tuned to, Only when I dream, She's got nothing on but the radio, and Dream on, for starters.  They are so catchy, and are so typical of this musical duo.  If you enjoy Roxette's early material I think you'll love this album.   If you are a Roxette fan, its a MUST HAVE.  What are you waiting for?
B000YKE87W|5.0|Jonas Kaufmann is developing a committed following and for good reason. Having just come from a recital in Los Angeles where he (and pianist Helmut Deutsch) presented an extraordinary evening - Part One Schumann ('Aus den Kerner-Liedern'  and 'Dichterliebe', and Part Two Strauss 'Schlichte  Weisen: F&uuml;nf Gedichte von Felix Dahn) and Vier Lieder, Opus 27) - that resulted in a tumultuous response from a full house demanding seven encores, it is clear that his impact on his audience is very powerful.  Having concentrated on Kaufmann's three recital sets of lieder, this listener decided to give Kaufmann's  operatic CD a try: he is as great with opera arias known as warhorses as he is with lieder.<br /><br />Jonas Kaufmann's voice is burnished bronze and gold. His range is tenor but his sound bridges both tenor and baritone.  He is able to produce volumes of sound and at the next moment sing pianissimos that require the finest breath control.  This CD is a pleasure to hear: singing from a tenor who understands the meaning of each of these varied arias, able to convey in one aria the complexity of the character, and yet avoid the crooning and bleating and theatrics that so often disrupt the musical line in other tenors' voices and manners. He elicits the love struck ardor of Puccini's heroes, offers a perfect 'Morgenlich leuchtend' form Wagners 'Die Meistersinger', manages to convey the depth of Verdi's fatal romances, offers one of the finest interpretations of Massenet's 'Werther', strengthens the Berlioz 'Invocation' from 'La Damnation de Faust', and on and on.  In addition to being a full voiced, intelligent and musical artist, Kaufmann is also exceedingly handsome and strikes a irresistible stage presence. It will be interesting to hear his new CD of Verismo Arias.  He is the real thing!  Grady Harp, March 11
B000F8O35U|2.0|I wasn't so sure to buy anything used \\"that looks like new\\". I was dissapointed with this dvd because it is defective. I had difficulty watching the begginning and also selecting language options. I should have gotten a new one for $4 dlls more.
B00459EZ7Q|5.0|This has developed so much in the second season! The first was a little slow but the story is really hitting it's stride now.
B0028K3192|5.0|I love this album! I listen to this record every week. This is a challenging, mature, sensual, courageous and emotionally open. This album is the sound of an artist taking the commitment to his craft and the conversation with his audience that much further. BLACK is a much darker but soulful compilation, SUMMERS' leans more toward the gospel side and NIGHT is more a cool collection of slow jams. This album found him exploring life with a bold and purposeful sensuality unmistakably his own. A constant throughout this album it its live and often raw sound. This album will be in my collection forever!
B004G5ZXVQ|4.0|I have been blown away by this release.  Prior to this cd, I had only heard Accelerate and then a few songs on the radio.  I heard Supernatural Superserious on the Colbert Report, so I gave the Accelerate a chance.  This cd blows that album out of the water.  Collapse Into Now is full of great songs, and I think it deserves attention.    Discoverer is a great first track.  It has this larger than life feel to it that really gives the album some energy.    All the Best is a good track, and it injects some attitude into the album.  The lyrics are cool, and I enjoy the guitar in this one.    Uberlin is an awesome track.  The first two tracks get things started off a little quickly, but this track brings you back down to earth to catch your breath.  The acoustic finger picking gives the track a very real feel instead of the more electronic, distant sound that comes from the previous two tracks.    Oh My Heart is an ok track.  I don't skip this track, but it doesn't excite me.  Average song.  It Happened Today is a great song.  The songwriting is much better than on Oh My Heart.  Eddie Vedder is on this track, and it all works well to make a great track.  Every Day is Yours to Win is another track that doesn't really get me pumped too much.  The lyrics and vocal delivery are kind of interesting, but it isn't one of the better tracks on the album.  Mine Smell Like Honey is a good song.  Some have said they don't enjoy it too much, but I think the lyrics are funny and entertaining.  Also, after the slower songs in the middle of the album, it is nice to have some upbeat energetic music.  Walk It Back sounds a bit like filler to me.  I don't know if some are enjoying it, but it just seems to not go very far musically.  Very boring.  Alligator Aviator Autopilot Antimatter is an ok track.  It is high energy, but the lyrics are laughable.  I don't mean that as in it was meant to be funny.  The lyrics are just stupid.    That Someone Is You is a great track.  It sounds like theband are getting back into the swing of things after some hit and miss tracks in the middle.  Stipe sings more in this song instead of speaking more, so I enjoy that as well.  Me, Marlon Brando, Marlon Brando and I is a cool song.  I didn't like it at first, but I turned the cd on to do some homework and loved the song.  I guess after I forgot about the weird title of the track I could give it more of a chance.  Great song.  Blue is a bit hard to digest.  The song is entirely spoken word by Stipe, but Patti Smith comes in to add some singing.  The song gets larger and larger as it goes on, and going back to the music from Discoverer is a really good idea.  After a couple of listens, this track becomes classic.      This album represents a bit of everything this band has ever brought to the table.  It has enough twists and turns to keep me happy for an entire play.  I don't love all of the songs, but all of it flows well from beginning to end.  The emotions the album takes you through is alone worth the price of admission.  It really sounds like the band found some inspiration starting in the writing for Accelerate, and it truly takes form on Collapse Into Now.  Accelerate was shorter and did not have as many top quality songs.  This cd is full of great songs.    Stipe is a very unique vocalist, and I think his method of delivery is refreshing from time to time.  The guitar work from REM is unique as well.  I think the band deserves a listen on this one.  As I said at first, I am new to the band.  I started primarily with Accelerate.  I advise anyone wanting to get into the band to check this out.  I don't have the biases for their works in the past, so as an album I say this is really good stuff.  If R.E.M. wasn't an extremely famous band, I still think this cd would pick up a large fanbase.  Buy it, and you won't be sorry.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|As a fan of Twilight who can admit the popular saga's flaws, I must say this novel is pretty wonderful. For those who liked the young adult series, chances are good you'll enjoy this piece of fiction as well.    Adult characters, adult themes - it does ring true to Twilight but with it's own flaws and perfections. The protagonist is a bit Mary Sue-ish. but Harkness does manage to supply reasoning behind it. Matthew, the vampire, is possessive but not nearly was creepy. The supporting characters were amazing as well, not falling in love with Diana as easily as the others did for Bella.    And Diana is not a complete damsel in distress.    Filled with a few boring but important sections, this  piece of work is fast-paced, engaging, and entertaining. And I eagerly await the next installment.
B004P9FAK2|4.0|I don't understand why all of these people are complaining about HP OOTP Ultimate Editions not having a directors or extended cut. Is this a double dip? Yes. Did Warner Bros add neww things to their ultimate HP movie sets? Yes!!! What do you call the eight hour documentary spread all over all eight ultimate editions? This is what clearly sets the Ultimate Editions apart from their standard DVD, and original Blu_Ray DVD releases. In my opinion the eight hour documentary is one of the most original speical features concepts available on Blu_Ray or any DVD for that matter. As a plus you also get most of the bonus material from the standard DVD release of OOTP, along with the material on the original BLu_Ray release, plus some of the bonus material from the long dead HD DVD release. Now, might it have been nice to include a directors cuts of all of the movies? Yes. Is it worth rating the entire Ultimate edition release a low 1 just becasue out of all the special features it does not have a directors cut? Heck No!!! But we live in a society, where every fanboy throws a fit becasue a release does not have everything he/she wanted. On the other hand, we also live in a soceity where all to often movie studios double dip without porting any of the special features from the previous editions onto the new edition. Does HP OOTP UD fall into this trap? Yes and no All of the special features from the previous releases are avaiable, with the exception of the annoying games, and the one hour segment of the eight part documentary is always fun to watch. On the flip side of the coin, extended edditions would be nice, and the price for the Ultimate editions is about $10 or $15.00 to expensive  Now are the movies perfect adaptations of the books? No But overall if you appreicate the films as being a differnt medium then the books, you can understand why some things were cut out. But even though fan favorite scenes may be left out or plot ideas not as well developed, the real treat of the eight HP movies is not how well they convey the story of the books-thats already been done by J.K Rowling-but seeing Daniel, Rupert and Emma mature as actors as their chracters mature in the books is the real treat of the movies and the eight hour documentary conveys this whole aspect of the movies really well[[ASIN:B004P9FAKW Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray]]].
B004HGBUVG|5.0|After the relatively disappointing West, it's an extra thrill to have Lucinda Williams come back with such a masterpiece. The songs are deeper and maybe even a bit darker than the past, but the themes she's always explored---love lost and found, betrayal, death, and God---are all here, interspersed with some lovely melodies and upbeat songs. Aided by some excellent guitar work by Elvis Costello on a few tracks, Williams reminds us that, even at 57, she can still rock out with the best of them. If you're new to Lucinda Williams' music, start here, you won't be disappointed, it's a classic.
0316066524|5.0|Long but worth it.  There's one section of 3 pages, for instance, that renders Candy and Train Spotting moot points.
1595141715|5.0|Thirteen Reasons Why is a well-written book.  It is a very intriguing story about a young girl, named Hannah, who commits suicide, but before she does, records multiple tapes (thirteen) about people who caused her death and then sends them out to those thirteen people, but is also about one boy, Clay, and how he listens to all of them and his emotions during his time in listening.  Jay Asher is a great writer and I fell in love with this book very quickly.  It is a fabulous read and is great for many ages.  It is very mysterious, captivating, and fascinating.  I enjoyed this book so much I would read it again in a heartbeat.  I highly recommend this to teenagers who cannot find the appropriate book to read.  This is an adrenaline pumping, heart breaking, brilliant, mesmerizing, story about love, hate, betrayal, loyalty, and many more emotions that can conquer not only your mind, but your heart.  You will get lost in the pages of this book and will not be able to stop reading until its over.
B004J713JW|1.0|The release date was pushed apparently due to a bad audio mix on the blu-ray version.    Best Buy in Los Angeles doesn't seem to know this as they put out the bad discs on the original street date.    I have one and Billy's vocals as well as the backup vocals are all pushed to the front. This happens in 5.1, and 5.1 PCM.    Make sure you have the newly authored disc.    5 stars for the content    1 star for the audio    UPDATED ON 4/6/2011    It seems they new nothing about the BAD AUDIO mix because it's not fixed.    AUDIO IS STILL BAD! THE BLU-RAY RELEASED THIS WEEK IS ALSO BAD! DO NOT BUY UNTIL IT'S FIXED!    AND why would they sleight the very consumers who are keeping home video alive by upgrading to Blu-Ray by not including the CDs??!!??!!    The whole thing stinks and I'm upset because I LOVE ME SOME BILLY JOEL!!!!!    Thanks for reading the rant.    Larry64
B00322PK2G|3.0|The second tick for this watch is REALLY loud! I can't leave it in the same room when I sleep.    It is a lot more casual and cheap looking than I imagined. I think it is because it is shinier plastic, not more matte white.    But it is really cute. I used to get lots of compliments on it before it got really dirty. It's white, so I can't complain about that one!
B001AIRUP4|5.0|The movie has plenty of parts that can scare kids, give them nightmares, or just creep them out, but plenty of kids will love it.    The stop-action filming is great, the voice-overs are great, the music is great...it's just a great movie.

1594202842|5.0|Couldn't put it down and gave me lots to think about. No, I wouldn't want to be -- nor could I be -- a mom like   Chua. But this book contains some excellent lessons for parents, teachers, and anyone who knows or works with kids. You don't have to agree with her parenting techniques, but you can enjoy her journey, her humor and self-deprecation, and lessons learned. You may learn different lessons than she did.     I found her book -- which is a memoir, not a self help or parenting book -- to be extremely empowering and far more interesting than any parenting book I've read. I would encourage other parents who are more concerned with whether their kids are \\"happy\\" than whether they are reaching their academic potential to read and consider this book. I believe that we need to set high expectations for our kids and our schools. \\"Having fun\\" and \\"achieving\\" can and should go hand in hand and need not be in conflict. That said, I'm all for my kids having playdates and sleepovers, participating in plays, enjoying team sports, engaging in our community, and playing musical instruments as part of a well-rounded, rich, and fun childhood. That's my job as a mom.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|With a blu-ray/DVD combo you can have it both ways.  I have the blu ray for home and the DVD for my vacation cottage.  This movie brought back fond memories of the greatest race horse I ever saw.  As far as the movie, it was well done but I must say I liked Seabiscuit better.  Both movies are worth seeing.
B00000IZOR|3.0|Cute, classic toy, but my one complaint is that the cord connecting the phone to the receiver is way too short.  Even my 1 yr old can't pick up the receiver and hold it to his ear without having to pick up the whole toy.  The cord is only ~6 in long...probably that way to prevent entanglement, but it then it impedes the functionality of the toy.

0375714669|3.0|This was a good story for a sequel. Overall, Marjane brought us back to the world of her youth and recaptured the changing feelings toward a culture unfamiliar to most. With humor, wit, and thoughtfulness I enjoyed the book--however, it left me with a less than happy ending (but isn't that life?).
0061564893|4.0|I feel a little guilty about it taking a year or so to finish this book, as I liked it. As a non science person it seemed really in depth and brought to mind many what if senarios as well as floating out there a new idea that I had never heard before.
B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|It's not often that I listen to a CD one time and really like it.  Well, it happened with \\"Collapse Into Now.\\"  Very nicely-done.  A bit mellow but mellow is good.  I think I might actually like this CD better than \\"Accelerate,\\" which I felt was a bit too grungy (my opinion, of course).<br /><br />I thought this CD had a \\"Greatest Hits\\" feel to it in that the tracks remind me of previous CDs.  Here is a track-by-track listing and where I felt they fit in with other R.E.M. CDs.<br /><br />\\"Discoverer,\\" \\"All the Best,\\" and \\"Blue\\" sound like R.E.M. from their \\"Green\\" and \\"Out of Time\\" days.  \\"Blue,\\" with its recorded voice reminds me a lot of \\"Belong\\" from \\"Out of Time.\\"<br /><br />\\"&Uuml;berlin\\" and \\"Walk it Back\\" sound like they would have fit nicely on \\"Automatic for the People.\\"<br /><br />\\"Oh My Heart,\\" \\"It Happened Today,\\" \\"Alligator_Aviator_Autopilot_Antimatter,\\" \\"That Someone Is You,\\" and \\"Mine Smell Like Honey\\" remind me of R.E.M.'s sound back in the beginning of the band.<br /><br />\\"Every Day is Yours to Win\\" and \\"Me, Marlon Brando, Marlon Brando and I\\" have a new sound to them and remind me of tracks that would have been on \\"Reveal\\" or \\"Around the Sun.\\"  I like both of these songs but I liked the newer R.E.M. sound (critics disagree).<br /><br />Overall, this is a great CD and deserving of the 5-Stars I gave it.  If you like R.E.M., you'll love this CD.
B0034G4OUO|4.0|Dwayne Johnson has spent 10 years in prison for being the driver in a bank robbery. After the robbery, another gang goes to their \\"secret\\" hideout, kills Johnson's brother, takes the money and leaves Johnson for dead. Now he is out of prison and wants revenge. A man named \\"R.G.\\" sets him up with what he needs. And before the credits are done rolling, Rock kills a telemarketer which we come to find out has been outlawed in California. (I would be willing to give up medical marijuana, if we could shoot telemarketers.)<br /><br />Billy Bob Thornton plays a burned out cop, who is addicted to heroin, caffeine, and cigarettes. There is also an assassin, with a British accent, who is not named Nigel, trying to kill Johnson. He has issues he tries to work out by talking to his therapist via Bluetooth just before he goes in for the kill. This is something that if done right could have added a humor aspect to the story, as it was, it was a distraction.<br /><br />The movie starts out as 5 stars. Good action and killing. Billy Bob Thornton enters the crime scene with Kenny Rogers' \\"Condition...\\" swagger music. For those old enough to remember there was a short period of time when having Kenny Rogers in your collection was cool. After a few killings the movie starts to drag.<br /><br />No sex or nudity.
B001D0DQUC|5.0|Okay, I did not get around to seeing this movie until 20 years after it came out.  I finally got it because it was so easy to rent online and watch on our new TV.  Also, a recent German house guest, when we took her to the Art Institute of Chicago and showed her all our favorite paintings, told us it was not a surprise because she had seen \\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\".  She added it was a great movie.  What she did not tell us was how funny it was!  I never laughed so hard for so much of a movie as I did for Ferris Bueller.  I imagine that the movie was aimed at the teen crowd, but it still rings true 50 years later.  I think this is the funniest movie that I ever saw.  At the same time, it was a very kind and gentle and fun movie.  A great way to forget you own troubles.  Enjoy.
0061997811|4.0|I order this book on behalf of my 12 year old daughter, who received an Amazon Gift card as a Christmas present.  The order was placed on Jan 30, 2011 and the book arrived on Mar 11, 2011.  I stayed with Amazon even though I was subjected to many, many days of \\"kid\\" pressure to cancel the order and to go with her to purchase the book from a brick and mortar store.  The rational for staying was simply cost.  Amazon was offering a much better price at the time than other stores.  Amazon customer support gets \\"5 stars\\" for their responsiveness to my multiple queries on the status of my order.  The delay, as I understood it, was due to the publisher and Amazon not having the inventory on hand.  Unfortunately, this was not represented accurately in the item data, which I politely pointed out to Amazon.  They did eventually update the data on the item but it is hard to tell the accuracy unless other customers provide input as well.    Once the book finally arrived, I asked my daughter: \\"So, was it worth the wait?\\"  Her response was a resounding \\"YES!\\".  She had the book for about half a day and carried it with her the whole time and crawled into bed reading it as well.  She did flipped the books pages for me, but was not ready to let go of it quite yet, so I can't really give you a detailed review on the actual content.  This review is really based on my daughters reaction.   As such, I would have given the book \\"5 stars\\" but I took one away for the shipping delays.
B0000DIXDR|4.0|I am a fan of movies, all kinds and all eras.  Dirty Dancing is a movie I saw on television so often that it almost seem to disappear while you were looking at it.  I'd never seen it in the movie theater and I don't know that it mattered to me before I bought this DVD.  However, I have a nice, large flat screen TV (like most of the USA) and when I played this DVD I was surprised and delighted.  It was enchanting.  The nostalgia was like visiting your past without the angst and acne.  It felt good.  I like a movie that makes me feel good.  This is one of those films.  Jennifer Gray is sweet and believable and Patrick Swayze is amazing to watch.  Except for some of the obvious dialog and a naive plot line I loved it.  Don't knock a naive plot line - it's sweet if it's in this movie.
B0040HJNKC|5.0|This album is one of Buddy's best.  The songs and the performance are very personal and let us get to know this legendary blues man. Buddy seemed to really enjoy making this album and he gives a lesson in how to play the blues.  This body of work provides all you would need to understand why so many guitar heroes have credited Buddy as an influence.
B00005JMYI|4.0|You can really tell the actors are having a good time when you see the bonus features in this.  There are countless blooper reels, and the interviews with the actors are even hilarious.  Definitely the best way to get the most out of a Will Ferrell movie.  It's also one of Steve Carell's debut movie screenings which he does such a great job in.  I won't give anything away, but in the bonus features they said some things about the history of the movie that really surprised me.  It gives it an interesting perspective.  Anyway, it's a great watch.  Not a kids movie, they probably wouldn't get a good portion of the jokes let alone the how appropriate this would be for them anyway.
B000Q6GX8Q|5.0|Excellent!  Stays true to the director's black and white filming, but \\"cleans it up\\" and makes the images much clearer!
1439190275|5.0|I bought this book to learn more about the Atkins diet.  I'm not much of a vegetable eater, so I was skeptical.  My husband and I both read it.  We're on our second week of the diet.  My husband lost 10 pounds the first week, and I lost 5.  If you've ever had negative ideas about Atkins, buy this book.  I have been eating a LOT of fat free foods for several years, and I weigh more now than I did when I started.  Why?  SUGAR.  Those fat free foods are loaded with sugar.  Fat doesn't make us fat.

They say that based on cognitive science and learning it's important to use many senses, so the book is \\"visually rich.\\" It may seem childish, but it works for me! I'll buy other Head First books.<br />[[ASIN:0596009208 Head First Java, 2nd Edition]]
B004NOCCEG|5.0|Not a movie for those who like to keep their head in the sand, this presentation moderated by Matt Damon is AWESOME!  To the point, direct, succinct story of how Wall Street just raped the American public, and got away with it in this current administration.  No arrests made.  No prosecutions.  And you can easily see the smug attitudes of the Wall Street pigs who know they are untouchable.  Gives me the heebie jeebies!
0756404738|5.0|I thought Name of the Wind was awesome...but I had to be patient with it. This is the story of a man's life and not every moment is exciting, but it is all interconnected to tell the story of a man's life. This is not your typical fantasy quest with action scenes every other page, fighting fantastic monsters. But it is compelling reading if you enjoy a great character whom you can get to know intimately. We are reading about what has shaped Kvothe...there are many things we can empathize with, others too terrible to know his pain.<br /><br />Rothfuss is an excellent writer, but he's in no particular hurry...there will be no rush, rush through. The Wise Man's Fear is no different than Name of the Wind. The writing is just as good, no better. Some may think Name of the Wind was better, but really what's going on is that this was all new in the first book. Now we've experienced many of the same situation with Kvothe before. The first third of the book continues his ordeals at the University: rivalry with Ambrose, cat and mouse searches for Denni, a very cool scene with Devi that was unexspected, learning from the masters and hoping he can find the money to remain without starving to death in the process. Could we have skipped it? Well, it seems repeated, but after all we are telling the story of a man's life...can it always be riveting? Not if it is realistic...and that is where this Chronicle finds its niche. This is fantasy but it sure does feel like a real narrative of someone's life from a different world, different culture.<br /><br />Everyone has problems and we're hooked to Kvothe desiring to see how he has dealt with his which are very much the same as anyone's. He fails miserably sometimes and pays the consequences, at other times he has small victories. Just like us. This is almost like \\"Reality Television\\" only done in a fantasy novel. Why do we find it so compelling? Because we can see ourselves in the same situations. Read TWMF with patience and you'll likely enjoy it as much as you did TNOTW.much as you did TNOTW.
0670022411|5.0|I don't know where to begin. This book tops the list of the 10 best books I've read in the last couple of years. It was fantastic! Reminiscent in some ways of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander, this story was excellently told, unpredictable and utterly enthralling. I so hope that we don't have to wait years for the next installment. A must read for anyone who loves vampires and witches.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|After using these for a day I have never went back to my surround sound that I was very happy with.  It's incredible how much better I can pin point where enemies are in COD: Black Ops, Halo Reach, and Battlefield Bad Company 2.  The mic is very flexible and detachable and it sets fairly well on my medium sized head and ears.  I would pay more money for foam padding that was a little less stiff and the volume adjustment on the wire between the controller to the headphones is very sensative.  But for the money I am very happy and will NOT go back to surround sound.  I also want to state that I love the treble and bass even at moderate volume strength.
B004ISVH7U|5.0|The 'SBM' Super Bit Mapping SONY Gold Disc version had been best mastering for years. THIS CD IS MASTERED IN SAME EXCELLENT CLARITY. Obviously, the DVD alone is the 'Must Have'  with the classic Charles Grodin produced NBC Special. Thankfully the CD mastering has even finer bass than the remastering a few years ago. Matching the excellent SBM Gold Cd, with levels improved over that as well. So, thank you Art and Paul, for making the records worth buying over and over and over.

0756404738|5.0|I can only Praise  Patrick Rothfuss' \\"The Wise Man's Fear (Kingkiller chronicles, Day 2)\\"  this and its predecessor,  \\"The name of the Wind\\".    This story is one that I never want to end.  The story is original, his concept of Magic, simply fantastic.  I have savored every dialogue, story and discussion the book produces.  Like a great meal this is a story one needs to digest slowly while taking in the nuances throughout the book.  His descriptions are exceptional; vibrant, touching and spellbinding. Originally I discovered the first book by chance through an Army MWR program while deployed in 2009.  Initially I choose it for its small type and large number of pages.  However, after the third page I was captivated and read it three times.
0439023521|4.0|I'm not a big fantasy buff, but this book got such a big reaction at the school library where I volunteer that I felt I had to read it.  It's compelling and well written. Appeals to both boys and girls.  i didn't love it enough to want to read the sequel - but I can certainly understand why we can't keep it on the shelf!

B0036TGSIK|5.0|What I've to say about this movie is short. I really enjoyed the movie, thought it was funny at times, and sad at times. In High School you do what it takes to be popular sometimes, but that's not what should matter, it should matter about who you really are, not what everyone else thinks you're. I think Emma Stone did great in this movie, and I would love to see her in more movies similar to this. I think Emma Stone is a great actor, and I hope Easy A gets her somewhere. Amanda Bynes was alright in this movie, but I personally think the role she plays wasn't meant for her. Overall I think this movie is an A+++.
0756404738|2.0|First, a quote from the author's interview at the top of the page: \\"And while the story is working well in this format, part of me wishes I'd broken it into smaller chunks. This second book has so many plotlines. If I'd written this trilogy as say, 10 books, each one would be much shorter and self contained. More like the Dresden Files.\\"  This separation into a half dozen plots is almost exactly what he has done, with some thin strands holding all of the plots together.  Fair warning to those who haven't read the first or the second book, there will be spoilers ahead because my main problem with this book revolves around the author's choice of how he moves the story forward from the first book. Therefore, all I'm going to be talking about are plot points.    If I were writing Wise Man's Fear, I would have had 5 goals: 1) Finish Ambrose story; 2) Move relationship with Denna along and prove her worth; 3) Learn more about the Chandrian and reveal some sinister plot of theirs which requires Kvothe to stop; 4) Kvothe learns some new and interesting skills which will help him fight the Chandrian. Somehow incorporate trip to the Fae to learn some of this; and 5) Kvothe snaps out of his doldrums in the present and returns to the fray.     Wouldn't that have been a satisfying book? Then we would have had the entire 3rd book to allow Kvothe to hunt the Chandrian, perhaps pick up a new trick or two, and go on a real adventure. That's what I expected to happen, and I can't understand what the author was thinking, or how it happened that none of his beta readers pointed this out. It's certainly clear to a good number of reviewers here on Amazon.  Unfortunately, almost none of this happens and we're left wondering what the heck could possibly happen in the 3rd book to wrap up the story? It's almost destined to be a failure because the story just isn't in the place it needs to be in order to have a satisfying conclusion. Anyway, let's get back to what actually does happen in thisbook:    1) Ambrose. This is _still_ not resolved. We're treated to another 350 pages of tooling around at the University, scraping for change, and not learning the Names of anything. Let me get this straight--Kvothe is trying to take revenge on supernatural beings who killed his family and scarred him for life, yet we can't wrap up some little spat with a spoiled brat in a reasonable time frame? This is not only silly, it's boring. Put the kid in his place already and move on.    2) Denna. She's a gold-digging whore, and their relationship has been stuck in neutral for nearly 1,500 pages counting the first book. Why? She's my least favorite character, with barely any redeeming qualities or anything interesting about her except that her patron(pimp) will turn out to be one of the Chandrian. There is almost nothing about her that deserves the reader's attention, or Kvothe's.    3) Magic. Kvothe is supposed to be hunting the Chandrian. Doesn't he need some sort of powerful magic to be able to kill them? Well if he does, he's sure taking his time learning anything useful that could kill them. If your goal in life is to avenge your family's murder by \\"find bad guys, kill bad guys,\\" then you need to be doing some sort of preparation for part 2 of your plan. A realistic character development would have him spending a huge amount of time pushing himself to learn forbidden magic in order to find as many ways to kill a man as possible.    I'm going to be incredibly disappointed if it turns out he wins \\"harry potter style\\" by bumbling his way to victory and his \\"sleeping mind\\" does all the heavy lifting whenever he gets into trouble. By the end of this book he should have been well on his way to becoming the most powerful student the University had ever seen. Instead, he's barely passable at calling the wind, and doesn't really know much magic that would kill a super-powerful wizard. Let alone 7 of them.     4) Skills. I've got no problem with Kvothe learning to fight. It'sa useful skill. But do we need 300 pages to learn this? In movies, this would be called the \\"training montage\\" where the protaganist trains and a lot of time passes in a short span of the story. The idea being, the audience doesn't need to have each day recounted to them when there is only repetitive training going on. Unfortunately, we never get that training montage in WMF. Instead, minor progress is catalogued and recounted in great detail, while Kvothe ends up with barely enough skill to be considered a threat in a fight. Wouldn't it have been more exciting if somehow his Alar carried over to his fighting skill and he was able to split his mind and use it to learn faster than normal people? Wouldn't it have been cool if he was actually impressive to the Adem and became a master swordsman in record time, the best they'd ever seen? Wait a second...that's brilliant. Let me re-write that part of the story.    5) Love. The Felurian bit was entertaining, but Kvothe's behavior did not fit. Here is a guy who is practically puritanical around Denna despite having known her for months, yet along comes a hot nymph and he just drops trou and goes at it like a rabbit? It just doesn't fit...ahem. Yes, I know she had Fae magic and all of that, but it was shown that he was able to overcome that. The guy is in love with Denna, and yet never has a spare thought for her while banging Felurian like a drum? No twinge of guilt? No regret? I mean I'm not saying there is anything wrong with enjoying yourself, and he had every excuse to do so with the most beautiful creature in existence, but there at least needs to be some acknowledgment of his relationship with Denna. Otherwise you're left with a character, you know, not acting in character.    For anyone who has followed Pat's blog at all, you would have thought he'd trimmed this book down to its bare bones and that the plot would be moving along at lightning pace. Now all I'm thinking is, who were his beta readers? Oot and his agent? \\"So, what did you think Oot?\\" \\"Dada gaga googoo\\" \\"Oh, so you thought it was good too? Awesome. What about you Agent?\\" \\"You're a winner Pat! You're killin' 'em! This book is the best ever!\\"     I blame the beta readers for not reigning in this great wallowing beast of a story (being 1 yr old is no excuse). Wait, beast isn't the right word. Manatee. Yes, that's better, a great wallowing manatee that keeps bumbling along, bumping into boats and picking up scars on its back.    I wish I enjoyed it as much as all the people giving it 5-star reviews, but I'm more in line with the camp that says the plot didn't advance. It's a little like going to see Hamlet at your local theatre, and then they have a 3 hour intermission where a clown shows up and blows up doggie balloons and rides around on a tricycle. Yeah, it's kinda interesting for a bit, but it quickly wears thing and you start to wonder about the Hamlet you showed up to see.    It's almost as if Rothfuss enjoys telling a story so much that he doesn't stop to think _if_ he should be telling the story. There are many examples of this throughout the book where people are sitting around a fire telling a tale for pages and pages that has nothing to do with the plot, and isn't in the least interesting.  There's really almost no other explanation for how or why the main storyline advanced the equivalent of 100 pages in the span of 1,000 pages. It's a shame, because I read The Name of the Wind for the 2nd time right before I started this book to refresh my memory, and Wise Man's Fear is just that much more dull in comparison.
B00338QENI|3.0|I enjoyed the scientific, legal, and ethical elements of this book, but didn't care as much for the detailed personal history.  Although biographical information bout Henrietta Lacks was clearly necessary, let's face it, we wouldn't be reading a book about her life if her cells hadn't been taken from her without her knowledge.  It's not as if Henrietta consciously did anything terribly remarkable herself.  And then, as if a lengthy focus on Henrietta's life weren't bad enough, most of the second half of the book details the history of Henrietta's family.  Really?  Thanks, but I really didn't care to read about Henrietta's daughter's emotional struggles and health issues, nor did I care to read about the criminal records of Henrietta's grandchildren.  This book would have been better at half its length.
0316010669|3.0|It was college level reading, too much research information thru out the book.  Overall, I enjoyed it and learn something from it.
B0034G4ORC|3.0|Battle: Los Angeles certainly seemed to have the same sort of potential that District 9 did leading up to its theatrical release. Some people were reminded of Independence Day from the promotion of Battle: Los Angeles while I leaned more toward District 9 since it was one my favorite films of 2009 and one of the more recent sci-fi films that left a lasting impression on me. Nevertheless, going in I was fairly convinced Battle: Los Angeles would have the same sort of impact District 9 did a few years ago; it'd make a pretty hefty profit while receiving a heap of positive reviews. While the film could still go on to make a killing at the box office, it unfortunately was fairly disappointing in the long run.<br /><br />While District 9 was my impression going in, it didn't take long for that impression to be shattered. That could be a good thing if the film ventured off into original territory or decided to travel a path that hasn't been done to death, but it didn't. The film is probably closer to Independence Day than District 9 with a little bit of Speed and Armageddon thrown in for good measure. Speaking of Armageddon, I really felt like I was watching a Michael Bay movie. The camera work was really sloppy, especially during the heavy warfare and devastation scenes. It made me just as nauseous as some of the more irritating scenes in Cloverfield. For the first half of the film, you don't get a clear shot of these extraterrestrials or their aircrafts. It just seemed really reminiscent of Transformers with a lot of the action taking place off screen. In Battle: Los Angeles, you see a lot of the gunfire and much of the action but you don't get a clear shot of what they're dealing with until later.<br /><br />It's a shame that the more action packed scenes aren't filmed better because they're pretty much the highlight of the film. Seeing the destruction these invaders have caused is incredible. The film makes you believe that Los Angeles is actually in ruins. The other really positive note is that the sound is fantastic. If you see this film, see it in a theater you know has a better than average sound system. When the aliens first show up and that high pitched squeal starts along with all of their other otherworldly sounds on top of roaring gunfare and marines screaming at each other is really just something else. The film uses two of your senses to a pretty fantastic extent, but your brain eventually steps in to tap you on the shoulder and tell you it's basically nothing more than glorified eye and ear candy.<br /><br />The cast is really dull. It feels like you're watching a cast full of six to twelve duplicates of the same character. Maybe that's because we follow one platoon from the Marines the entire film, but still none of them really stick out other than Aaron Eckhart. Eckhart has the chance to let SSgt. Michael Nantz show some genuine emotion in the film. The platoon that died because of him on a previous mission is the driving factor of his character and him having to prove he's worth being where he is to another platoon that thinks he got those men killed just so he can survive ties into the storyline of the film fairly well.<br /><br />Battle: Los Angeles doesn't come anywhere close to living up to its potential. Ever crave something you really like to eat it and then get it only to have it leave a bad taste in your mouth? That's Battle: Los Angeles. The film feels too common and too cliche. It honestly just made me want to watch District 9 again and anticipate a sequel to that more than anything. But whether Battle: Los Angeles reminds you of District 9, Independence Day, Transformers, or some other film you've seen before, you've probably seen an alien invasion done better. Besides, do you really want to watch a film that you think is done by Michael Bay when it's not? Still, the action fan in me can't claim the film is completely terrible due to the intense action sequences and incredible sound used throughout thefilm.
0131103628|5.0|This is a great classic reference.  I work in a large software company and this is the book you see on almost every desk top, it is always the most well-used book too!  Well written, well organized, basic reference. No matter how experienced it is always useful to have this reference on your desk, you'll never know when you will need it to bail you out!
1416955070|4.0|City of Bones shows us a world of Shadowhunters, specially bred humans. These Nephilim are warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons, demons most humans can't even see. We meet Clary Fray and friend Simon as they head out for a night on the town. Clary witnesses a demon slaying and Jace, head Shadowhunter, knows she must be special.<br /><br />When Clary's mom's life is threatened, Clary is thrown into the Shadowhunter world and discovers everything her mom has been hiding about her true lineage. Jace believes himself to be father-less, thinking he saw his father murdered in cold blood. The bond between Clary and Jace is immediately evident but not as it initially appears.<br /><br />I loved the twists and turns. Every time I thought I had a grasp of a character, the plot threw me a curveball. Some of these deviations I enjoyed, some I didn't. Cassandra Clare weaves an intricate tale and leaves you wanting Book Two. Although the story is fast-paced and rewarding, the characters are thinly developed. Will I feel that way after Books Two and Three? I'm not sure, but I shouldn't have to read three books to feel an understanding for the characters.<br /><br />Although Clary and Jace propel story, I was intrigued more by minor characters like Simon, Luke and Jocelyn (Clary's mom). I'm not sure this was the Author's intent. Normally, I want the main characters to drive me from page to page. I hope the next two books bring some special powers to Simon and a full understand of what motivates Jocelyn. Let's hope anyway.<br /><br />Listed on Amazon as appropriate for grades 8 and up. I would agree, and might go younger. For lovers of demon romance, there's very little and hints of it prove discouraging. At least in Book One, this series is more about the action and resolution than romance and deep thought.<br /><br />As I always say, an Author's ultimate goal is to get you to buy their next book. Book Two is already bought.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|3/12/11,Saturday. I just finished reading &#34;IT&#34; tonight. It is the first Stephen King book I have ever read. It is also the first book that I have purchased and read on my new Kindle. Stephen King deserves all the praise and accolades that he has received. He truly is a top notch writer. Genious! The man must have Tiger Blood running thru his veins like Charlie Sheen. LOL. God Bless you Mr. King! You truly are one of a kind. I'm off to purchase and read another novel from this beast of an author. ; ) - Duh, WiNNiNG!
B004MMEIK0|4.0|I got this free for Kindle.  It's a paranormal romance/chick lit like book.  The protagonists are non-biting vampires lead by a hunky, brilliant scientist (a monk before he was turned) who invented synthetic blood.  Of course you have the not so nice vampires who like to bite and kill with the leader set on fulfilling a contract to murder the heroine.  It's classic good vs. evil stuff with a sassy human dentist, highlanders, harems, vampire sex and TV, etc. thrown in.  I laughed at some of the antics but cringed at the discussions about god and not being worthy of redemption--there was way too much of that for me.  I don't recall it being labeled as christian fiction because then I would have expected the god talk.  Overall, I liked it and will probably read the next book by this author (particularly if I get if for free!).
B001RCD2DW|5.0|I wanted to first state to please do your research before purchasing these headphones.  Open back headphones are not for everyone!  They have totally distinct sound from close back headphones.  The best way i can describe them is that they sound like you are sitting in an open room with the artist singing directly in your ear.  Its weird!  The sound is \\"open\\" with an echo-ish sound to them in super high detail. I gathered they are designed for the artist to hear their mixes as they would sound on stage or in concert.  That is the \\"huge sound stage\\" people are talking about. saying that...<br /><br />First impression:<br />The minute i fitted the cans on my head, i noticed they are super light weight.  The ear pads are a bit on the stiff side. Similar to wearing a new motorcycle helmet stiff, but you can tell that they will wear in nicely.  The AKGs adjusts to your head size very easily the minute you put them on.  Very weird the way it works but it works very effectively! I have a medium rounded head so they fit great on me.  Even after long hours of usage they fit on my head with no fatigue.<br /><br />Music Sound Quality:<br />I'm going to be completely be honest with you all and say that i almost boxed them back up and was getting ready to contact the seller to have them returned. The first 15min i was thinking to myself wondering what the hell would someone give these headphones a good review? To me, they sounded horrible! Luckily the seller was closed for the night, otherwise i would had shipped them back.  I decided to do some extra research while listening to the headphones and learned they have a long break-in period.  ~130+hrs were some quotes people where saying about them.  So i did..  After about an hour or so they began to open up.  I began hearing things from my flac(lossless) audio files that i've never heard before. I was mesmerized on how clear they began to sound.  Seriously people, I have never heard such clarity and i'm sure you probably haven't either.  These things are extremely clear!  You can really appreciate how clear they are when listening to Jazz, Classical, instrumental tracks and music with lots of vocals. People that listen to heavy metal or rap will probably be a little disappointed. Compared to my Monster Dr Dre headphones i own, the monsters had more bass.  That is the only advantage the Dre's had over the 702s.  The $400 Dre's don't even come close to the clarity and detail the 702s put out.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the AKGs dont have any bass.  In fact, they do if properly amped. just not overwhelming bass (like the Dre's) but enough to enjoy the music the way its supposed to be heard and distortion free.<br /><br />Power:<br />No doubt about it. The AKGs will give you a grin from ear to ear if you provide them with enough power.  I'm using the Astro mixamp (for my video games) in conjunction with the Fiio e9 amp.  The Fiio e9 is all you really need to take advantage on what 702s offer.  You can pick up the Fiio e9 for about $130 here. In fact, the Fiio amp has the same specs/power that $400 - $2000 headphone amps put out.  They are a hell of a bargain amp. The other method is by plugging them in straight into your Home theater Amp. please do not attempt to plug them directly into your IPOD/zune.  They'll work but, portable MP3 players weren't made to run highend headphones like these.<br /><br />Gaming:<br />This is where the AKGs start to get really fun!  Black OPS on the xbox sound insane with these things! The sound totally submerges you in the game!  I'm not kidding when i say \\"it sounds like you are really there\\"..!  Due to its huge sound stage, it sounds like you are outside getting shot at.! LOL  You can clearly hear the bullets whizzing by your head and the direction its coming from. This became helpful for me as it gave me that split second to defend myself from someone missing me.  I also was able to hear the enemy sneaking up behind me with the ninja perk. I even tookcheap shots on people through walls because i heard them.  LMAO..!  I recommend playing games like F.E.A.R and Dead Space 2 with the lights on! No joke...!<br /><br />Final thoughts:<br />Sound quality: 10 - 10<br />Fit/comfort: 10 - 10 (even after wearing them for long hours)<br />Build quality: 10<br />Bass: 6 - 10 im pleased..<br />Clarity: 10 you cant get any better!<br />Fun:  10  The 702s are Incredible for gaming.  Truly multi purpose set of cans.<br /><br />P.S Once broken in the 702s can only be bested by $1500 headphones.  Yes they are that good!  Do your research and understand the differences between open and closed backs.i heard them.  LMAO..!  I recommend playing games like F.E.A.R and Dead Space 2 with the lights on! No joke...!

B003UESJFG|3.0|I had not seen this in a movie theater and I was really excited when it finally came out and I was able to buy it. However, I was disappointed of the plot. The evil Megamind character and his fish-assistant were great, but the city hero was just too typical:handsome, vain and selfish.<br /><br />I would give the plot 2 stars.<br /><br />The characters (Megamind and his assistant) 5 stars and the rest of the characters 2 stars.<br /><br />The plot I would give just 1 star because right from the beginning it was just like the Superman -story: the child from a distant planet is sent away to the earth, falls in love with a news reporter girl, has trouble telling about his love to her.<br /><br />With the Megamind character the screenwriters could have done a much more interesting and twining plot than this straight forward copy of a superman story.
0061997811|5.0|The people who created this book were also the ones who created the graphic design elements for the movie, and so not only is is more-than professionally done, but it also contains several original documents within it that are in the movie: an original HP Hogwarts acceptance letter, Yule Ball program, Quidditch world cup program, the Marauder's Map, a Weasleys' Wizarding Wheezes order book, a Borgin and Burke's company book, educational decrees from none other than Professor Umbridge, a small \\"Mafalda Hopkirk\\" identity book, and a sticker filled book with the \\"Advanced Potion Making\\" cover that is seen in the sixth film.    I am 18 years old, a HUGE Harry Potter fan, and I was deeply impressed with this yearbook-styled book. It's fairly large, there are several extended pages within the book, and so much information and so many pictures that you can appreciate. Seriously, if you love the books and the movies, BUY THIS BOOK!!!

B003HGKJ3M|4.0|4/5. \\"Hunting High and Low\\" is the debut album by the Norwegian trio a-ha and a huge commercial success in the 80s. It took the founding members of a-ha   - Pål Waaktar and Magne Furuholmen two trips to London without money to get producers interested in their music, which paved way for international successes all over the world for the next 25 years.   Music on this album is mostly electronic with melodic and well-structured keyboards and that irresistible Scandinavian flavor which comes with every a-ha song. The opening track is one of the most beloved singles of the eighties - \\"Take On Me\\". The cutting-edge song video was in heavy rotation on MTV in the eighties and features the band in a pencil-sketched animation and filmed movie. The song has one of the hardest-to-sing choruses in the history of pop-music and showcases Morten Harket's evocative vocal stylings. Two more outstanding tracks on the album are explosively powerful \\"The Sun Always Shines On TV\\" and melodic ballad \\"Hunting High and Low\\". The latter is in fact one of the major highlights of a-ha career and one of the favorite sing along tunes during live performances. The song about going every distance on earth to find your love again is dramatic both musically and lyrically. The chilling music setting and emotional vocal performance by Morten Harket create vivid images of going as far as you can go to find your lost love through land of tundra and icy plains with huge seagulls yelling over your head. This is also one of the lyrical gems of the album, whereas most of the other tracks are overly simple and do not have real appeal. The album is actually typical a-ha: very Nordic and exploring themes like failed relationship, loneliness, isolation and Norwegian rain.   The downsides of this album are that some of the songs may sound dated, especially synth-pop tunes like \\"Train of Thought\\" , \\"Love is Reason\\" and \\"Dream Myself Alive\\", which are slightly reminiscent of early Depeche Mode and are only savedby Morten's vocal abilities. Another problem is that although most of a-ha songs are penned by Pål Waaktar, he does not leave much space for himself on this album and his guitar can only be heart at certain points. Even when you hear the guitar rhythm, it is so heavily produced that it blends with the keyboards.   The deluxe version of \\"Hunting High and Low\\" released in 2010 contains also a second CD with demos, early versions of songs and previously unreleased tracks. While this second CD is mostly of interest to serious collectors, it does have its moment. Songs like \\"Go To Sleep\\", \\"Monday Morning\\" and \\"All the Planes That Come In On The Quiet\\" have great arrangement and could have well ended on the album as potential replacement for shallower tracks \\"Blue Sky\\" and \\"And You Tell Me\\". Another interesting track on the deluxe edition is  original 7\\" version of \\"Take On Me\\", which was produced by Tomy Mansfield and sold only 300 copies before a-ha managed to convince Warner to record the song with a different producer. -Sain Alizada
B002JVWRAE|5.0|I'm thinking about purchasing this blu ray set, but I'd first like to hear from people who have bought it on amazon. Is it worth it? Does it come with the same extras as the regular set? Do all the discs from this set play fine? (I've seem some reviews from people saying they've bought dvds from amazon and were disappointed because they came scratched or simply wouldn't play at all).    Did you receive the packaging in mint condition or was it damaged?    I'm sorry if my questions seem annoying, but I would appreciate it a lot if someone could anwers them. I see there are a lot of reviews about the show itself, but I haven't seen any commenting on the actual product, so I'm concerned whether it's safe to buy it or not.

B004BLTNL6|4.0|This is not an entertaining film. What is scary, though, is how little has changed in the way some men view women in the years since this movie was made. Just compare the conversation between the male characters in this piece and some of the most popular lyrics of these days.
B00021R7CG|5.0|I found this film via the suggestions made on Amazon while picking up my old favorites [[ASIN:B00004SGB5 On the Beach]] and [[ASIN:B00004XPPE Fail-safe (Special Edition)]]. I found [[ASIN:B0000AMRUP The Bedford Incident]] in the same way. I must say that for an HBO production this really has a theatrical feel to it and I suspect could even have been shown in theaters successfully when it was made. It is a chilling and tightly directed thriller about one of the ways we could, and still can, annihilate ourselves. The acting is absolutely superb from each and every cast member. With greats like James Earl Jones and Matin Landau, how can you go wrong? I tried to watch this while doing some other work and really could not - it demands your full attention and rightly so. Although some of the dialogue is necessarily dated (references to \\"the Soviets,\\" for example) the plot really holds up quite well despite being made over 20 years ago. I feel this film really belongs up there with the likes of Fail Safe, Dr. Stragelove and the like. It is a terrific example of the genre.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This was a completely wonderful read. Diana Bishop and Matthew Clairmont are wonderfully written, I cared about them instantly. I found Witches fast paced and exciting-it was hard for me to put down the book. Very few books leave me missing the characters as this one did. My only saving grace is there will be another book finishing the story.I highly recommend this fabulous book!
B0034G4OXQ|3.0|I viewed this movie on Thursday, normally right after watching a movie I would rush to write a review while everything is still fresh in my mind. However, this was not to be the case. But yesterday, after seeing the vast and total devastation of the tsunami in Japan, I decided to now write it, in memory of all those who perished in this disaster.<br /><br />A very realistic Tsunami<br /><br />This movie opens in India 2004, with a very realistic tsunami sequence. This is a very frightful situation to be caught up in. Those living in low lying coastal earthquake prone areas must now consider the very real possibility of a tsunami coming to shore and changing their lives forever.<br /><br />A Necromancer<br /><br />In this film, Matt Damon takes on the role of George Lonegan. It is explained that because of a near death operation that he now has the ability to communicate with the dead. While this appears to be a plausible explanation, it should be noted that this is only fiction. According to Christian beliefs, the souls of the dead do not just drift about waiting to talk to their relatives through `mediums'.<br /><br />The Plot<br /><br />The plot starts out on three fronts:<br /><br />[1] - a French reporter who turns writer, her life is changed by a tsunami;<br />[2] - 2 brothers (twins) one is killed and the other desperately misses him; and<br />[3] - a necromancer who is trying desperately to live a normal life.<br /><br />In the end, the lines are all neatly tied up. Overall this is an interesting picture, but remember, it is only fiction, so don't go out there trying to hear from your deceased loved ones.

B002QKZLZ6|5.0|I wish I had bought this headset long ago.  I bought this headset because 1.) don't want to hold a phone while driving and  2.) I call my 93 yr old mother every day on the way home from work.  With my old headset, my mother could barely hear me because of road noise.  With this headset, she thinks I am calling from my house, even when I am going 65mph.      The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I have difficulty getting the headset around my ear. And I believe it is the arm on my glasses that causes the difficulty. With my old headset I could do it with one hand. This one requires two hands. I have to take off my glasses, put on the headset, and then put the glasses back on. My son has a headset like this, wears glasses, and does not have the same problem I do.
0767903862|5.0|As usual, Bill Bryson is a marvellous writer with a droll sense of humor and a dry wit, who tells a delightful story of his experiences travelling. Also as usual, he conveys the sense of the place he's visiting quite enchantingly while providing a rather large dollop of outside information about the place from his reading; he is quite thorough in his research. This time, his choice of location is Australia, a place that I knew was fascinating even before I began to read his book. Now, I'm aware that I didn't even know the half of it. As in \\"The Lost Continent\\", a book of his travels around the continental United States, he details the places that have excellent amenities while still retaining their unique charm, those that have perfectly adequate (possibly even fabulously lavish) amenities, but are totally generic, and those that have (in his experience) lousy amenities. The difference between this book and that is that in Australia, he seems willing to overlook the shortcomings of the places with lesser amenities, because he is so enthralled with the country as a whole. That attitude makes this book far more readable than that one; it's much more fun when the writer seems to be enjoying himself, even in the midst of what could have been unpleasant experiences.
B002DPRLEI|4.0|My wife and I love to occasionally watch old Doris Day movies for fun.  I love Doris Day's face expressions.  She can really glare when she is mad and squint her eyes.  She has this crossed eye face expression that is always cute to look at.  Her comedies are quite amusing. And her send me flowers song is a lighthearted song in her Doris Day style. Rock Hudson is great, Clint Walker is good and Tony Randall is funny and well cast for Rock Hudson's zaney neighbor and lawyer. I'm not much of a writer, but I sure like to watch the old comedies of the 1950's and 1960's.  And \\"Send Me No Flowers\\" is a Doris Day/Rock Hudson Classic.

I feel there is value to the $12 book, though there are more ideas available on the web site and more added all the time. Naturally the book is not perfect and with hindsight bakerella may have wanted to add more information about cake pop troubleshooting, for example--cracking candy, pops falling into candy, top heavy cake pops, food pens that don't write, etc.    Unfortunately the book was not able to include the hello kitty design, which is difficult to make, and would have added to the value of the book.    The book remains a good resource for cake pop makers and easier to use than constantly referring to the web site.  Go bakerella!    Best cake pop design (not by bakerella) is the rose bud pop [...]

030726999X|1.0|The book came on time. The price was good for a hard cover. The problem started when I got to page 124. The print was so badly faded, it was unreadable. That was not enough to stop me from reading. Every fan of Stieg Larsson's series knows that this was an engrossing read and the last in the series. I was fed up with trying read when ten (10) more pages were completely unreadable and numerous other pages were faded.

0805079076|5.0|This is a great book. For someone who doesn't have any formal education in language evolution but this book explains beautifully the evolution of even the hardest of the languages.  My favorite chapter is Chapter 5, in which a linguist explains how the chaos can create new and beautiful structures.  The only mistake, which I can forgive thanks to the quality of the rest of the book, is that the author repeats himself many times and it can get a bit tedious. Also, there are a couple of places in the book where you cannot discern what's the case the author is arguing for. Mainly at the end of the book.    Finally, a nitpick. As a spanish-speaker native, I'm a bit disapointed that spanish wasn't more used as an example through the book. This is the case, though, probably because French has most of the characteristics of spanish and even more quirks. One thing I would like for him to have explained, nevertheless, is the rise of the \\"Ser/Estar\\" verbs, which, at least in my limited experience, is not a common distinction.    But don't get discouraged by this nitpicking. Buy. This. Book.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|This is [perhaps] the greatest music themed movie ever created. Quite simply, it's about the joys of making music.<br /><br />A driving force of the movie are the songs...and they are very strong songs! There is a mutual reciprocity between the film and the soundtrack since the songs carry the movie and the movie showcases the songs. Because the songs are so imperative to the movie, it is impossible to judge the tunes on their own...they must be regarded in the context of the picture.<br /><br />For instance, \\"Falling Slowly\\" is a great song, but when thought of as the song that the two characters first meld their chemistry, it's becomes a fantastic song.<br /><br />\\"When your minds made up\\" is a beautiful and uplifting song. It's the most musically complicated song of the soundtrack which makes perfect sense since this is the song used to demonstrate the characters' getting access to a recording studio and feeling the joy of laying down their tracks.<br /><br />A very aggressive second chorus in \\"Say it to me know\\" acts as the introduction to the main character in the movie. The song is played in a very passionate manner which constitutes exactly what that  character is all about. It's a rendition that makes perfect sense.<br /><br />All of the songs on this soundtrack are excellent (they are great songs on their own probably because the two actors are real musicians and, I think, many of these songs existed before the movie) but the magic of these songs only come through when they are juxtaposed with scenes from the movie.<br /><br />The two characters created a group called 'The Swell Season\\" and perform these \\"Once\\" songs regularly.<br /><br />This movie was made on a shoestring budget and there were no hitmakers creating the music. Between the songs, movie and two actors. \\"Once\\" is a perfect example of lightening being captured in a bottle

B001EN1R2M|5.0|Every time I listen to this album, I am struck by the collision of musical styles Motley Crue mashed together on their debut.  Yes, it gets classified as heavy metal, but, elements of power pop, new wave, glam, punk and bubblegum are evident throughout the album.  Of course, with Nikki Sixx being a fan of both Sweet and the Raspberries, it's not surprising.  And, Vince's voice is barely a hair removed from Dale Bozzio territory.  For every razor riff from Mick Mars, there's a candy-coated melody on \\"C'mon and Dance\\" or \\"Starry Eyes\\".  Motley Crue, IMO, created a unique sound on TFFL, one they never returned to, and frankly, one that, as far as I can tell, no one had covered prior to Motley Crue, and haven't since.

Infact, my guitarist always is using this one over his boss. um...what else..I seriously read the directions, and all the modes make 0 sense to me, but i just use it as a traditional tuning pedal. It does take about 6-10 seconds to warm up to the instrument plugged in, but after that its pretty fast.

It is solidly built, and does everything you need it to.  Its small enough that I can take it with me when I travel (which is quite often), and durable enough that I'm not worrying if its getting smashed in my bag.  Would recommend this to anyone who is novice to intermediate when working with midi controllers.  There are certainly better out there, but most definitely not at this price!
B000EOTAM6|1.0|This movie is a disappointment. I enjoyed the original Aeon Flux series and I respect Charlize Theron.  Something went horribly wrong with this movie.      One of the most important factors for Aeon Flux is the incredible visuals. Characters would pull out cool gadgets and do cool thangs with them. Interesting points of view are used to convey the action in a stylistic manner that keeps pace with the story being told. This movie missed that mark completely.    Instead, it has a few underdeveloped special effects. The action is constantly abruptly stopped, instead of conveying the story through the action. Instead of participating in the action, Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) tends just walk around while everything goes on around her. When she does fight, the action is cut off. I don't think I saw one punch or kick ever get close to landing. We'd see the beginning of the punch thrown, then get the cut away of the person already lying on the floor dead with Aeon Flux doing more walking away. It wouldn't have been hard to make this film much better. As it is, it turned out to be lame.

1594202842|3.0|My opinion of this book is somewhere in the middle.  On one hand, I find it interesting because I'm about to graduate with my masters in counseling so I'm interested in human behavior.  On the other hand, I was deeply angered by the the events that took place in this book, especially the harsh comments and verbal berating to her two daughters...  Some of the emotional abuse was hard for me to stomach and, at times, I had to put the book down and focus on something else for a while.  As for the writing style, I felt like it was an easy read which was nice since the subject matter made the book difficult enough.  Like I said, I'm stuck in the middle with my opinion.  I can't say that I like this book because what is to like about emotionally abusing your children but I can appreciate her honesty and letting us in to her way of raising her children.  It was definitely eye-opening...
B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|My initial evaluation of \\"Collapse Into Now\\" was one of disappointment.  I had seen where Peter Buck was saying it was as great a 12 songs REM had ever put on an album.  Mike Mills was saying it was their best since \\"Out of Time\\", which meant he thought it was superior to \\"Automatic for the People\\".  So I was expecting something on the level of an \\"Automatic for the People\\".  It's not on that level.  But after getting over my initial disappointment, I was able to start enjoying \\"Collapse Into Now\\" for what it is.  And what it is is an album that gets better and better upon each spin.  Every song is worthy.  Most are fantastic.  It's passionate, poignant and fun.  So my final evaluation is that this is just another great REM album. How can one be disappointed with that?       I'm not one who thought there was a great drop-off in quality after Bill Berry left.  I thought the core song-writing mostly remained fantastic, even stunning at times --  but they went for a more subtle laid-back and overly intellectualized approach to production and arrangements, to the point where much of the life and passion were sucked out of the final result, especially on \\"Around the Sun\\".  But I still thought a lot of the core song-writing on \\"Around the Sun\\" was inspired and that it worked well as background music.  Had \\"Around the Sun\\" been given the same kind of production and arrangements and performed with the same kind of passion that's evident on \\"Collapse Into Now\\", then I believe public opinion of that album would have been 180 degrees divergent from what it ended up being.

1933492929|5.0|Contrary to another reviewer, I find this book to be replete with useful process work. She builds many animals from the skeleton to muscles, finally to skin and fur. Have you ever seen a dolphin broken down to muscle groups?  (I haven't, and it's here)  I do wish she spoke more about her process of choosing poses and gestures. I also wish she had broken down one design into replicable steps, from gesture to linework, to patterns and then color. In spite of my desire to see this,  I cannot \\"dock her\\" for omitting it, there is too much good material here.    Her creatures are fierce and cute, cuddly and vicious, but all compelling.  For students, she has great zoological research and breakdowns. We can all use Google image search to find animal reference, but Ms. Whitlatch gives us meticulously reconstructed marine, avian, bovine and primate specimens in one book.    This is a profound book of great generosity that Terryl Whitlatch has given us. Thank you.

B002RZZIXU|4.0|I highly recommend this book as a story (it is a 100% brilliant reworking of an old-fashioned spy thriller) but my enjoyment was undermined by the shockingly bad Kindle edition. It is filled with typographic horrors: sentences without fullstops; accents that turn into other characters (façade --> fagade); 'w' morphing into 'v/'; missing apostrophes; etc. It is appalling that the publisher thinks that this is acceptable. I don't mind some typos in a free book, but the e-edition of a book still in print from a professional publishing house (Bloomsbury) ought to mirror the 'real' book in every detail. This book has been converted so lazily that they've even left the paragraph at the end saying what font the [real] book is in. Lazy and sloppy.

1439102724|2.0|As a long-time fan of Jodi Picoult, I had been counting the days until the release of \\"Sing You Home.\\"  Now I find myself puzzled - and yes, a little heartbroken - over this lackluster effort, especially since the subject matter held such promise.  I have come to expect several things when I open a book with Jodi's name on the cover ~ a fascinating controversial plotline, well-written prose and dialogue, and well-rounded, believable characters.  Oh, and of course, a gripping, nail-biting trial.  Unfortunately, other than the plotline, Sing Me Home contained none of those things.    The characters of Reid, Dara, the pastor and Max's lead attorney were stereotypical to the point of becoming caricatures. Yes, stereotypes usually exist for a reason ~ but with a subject matter as timely and as explosive as this one ~ from the embryos to the lesbian family to the radical born-again Christians ~ I did not expect an author as talented as Jodi Picoult to fall back on them, and find myself disappointed - and even a little betrayed - that she did so.  I had expected to gain new insight into the different sides of these issues, since I always come away from her books thinking, examining my own feelings and beliefs, and looking at the world sometimes a little bit differently and sometimes a lot.    The main characters of Max and Vanessa were not believable to me.  At least Max was vaguely two-dimensional, but not in a way that I could imagine him to be a real person.  Vanessa was not real at all.  As for Zoe... well, she was the most finely drawn character, loving and flawed in realistic ways.  But because the other characters were not any of those things, I felt emotionally manipulated the entire time.  The relationships were also not entirely believable - not the way Max left Zoe, not the way Zoe and Vanessa fell in love so quickly and were married and ready to start a family so quickly.  Even the dynamic between Max and his brother/Max and his sister-in-law did not ring true.Part of this is because we were rushed so quickly from one person's POV to another.  I know this \\"dancing POVs\\" drives many readers crazy in general, but it has never bothered me in Picoult's books because her transitions are generally smooth.  Not the case here.    The worst part for me, however, was the trial ~ always the climax of Picoult's novels.  Working in the legal transcription for over 30 years, I know enough not to expect any book (or TV show or movie, for that matter) to accurately depict a trial ~ not even the opening statements.  If an author were truly realistic, the readers would be asleep within the first ten minutes. I understand that dramatic license needs to be taken in order to create a gripping read, so I am willing to suspend my disbelief... TO A CERTAIN POINT.  But I couldn't do it here.  The mixture of church and state was utterly ridiculous.  No judge in the United States of America, no matter WHAT his/her personal beliefs were, would have allowed what took place, not from the first words of the opening arguments.    And then there's the ending... aah, the ending. It felt like Ms. Picoult had written herself into a corner and was unable to find her way out.  She gave us a pat, unbelievable ending that raced by so quickly, I had to turn back a few pages to see if I had missed something.  Then we are immediately thrust into an entirely new POV, six years into the future, to see what the outcome was.  It was like being hit by an icy-cold tidal wave.  There were no transitions.  There was no closure.  We never found out what happened to poor Lucy, the only character that was well-drawn and believable, the only character I actually cared about.  We never found out what happened to Reid in the aftermath of all the decisions that were made.  We never even found out if Zoe lost her job.    I recently reread \\"Second Glance\\" and was left amazed all over again by what an amazing writer Jodi Picoult truly is.  I feel like the hours I spent reading \\"Sing You Home\\" were an utter and complete waste of my time ~ time I can never get back.  And it hurts me to say that, because I have loved every single book Ms. Picoult has ever written, with the sole exception of \\"The Tenth Gate\\" ~ but even that book was better than this one.      If you haven't read Ms. Picoult's older titles, I highly recommend you spend your money on them instead of this book.  And if you have read them, reread them... or buy something else entirely.  I guess no one can hit it out of the park every time... but what a disservice Ms. Picoult has done with subject matters that need to be written about and read about.
0385333846|4.0|The beginning of this book was really clever. Once the point of view was shifted to Billy Pilgram, however, things slowed but the time shifts were a novelty and the repetitive structure was witty. His humor reminded me of Douglas Adams. The title of the book, also, made me think it was going to go in a different direction but my expectations were belied as it was not what I expected. I was enjoying it immensely when, before I knew it, the last chapter died softly in my hands. So it goes.
1597801585|2.0|This book has some interesting ideas about the future of agribusiness and the energy crisis. That's about it, though.    As other negative reviews have stated, the writing is clumsy and does not allow a good flow from page to page. It stifles the reader's interest in the book, good story or not. And the story isn't that great, either. Some things happen, but the author never pursues any plot line to its potential. You instead get five or six subplots that intersect once in a while, but nothing ever really comes together to drive a main plot. I wish the author would have focused on just a couple of these subplots and developed them into a good, deep storyline. I also was left wanting much more development of the ideas such a \\"kink springs\\" for energy. A scientifically strange concept, but it was left as a cool idea that remained a cool idea, nothing more.     The characters were not engaging. I found myself unable to relate to them through nearly the whole book.     The rape/abuse scenes made me cringe. They were unnecessarily graphic, and seemed more focused on being \\"fanservice\\" for males with depraved fetishes about violating women without consequence (even though the girl kills her abusers) than on driving the plot. The sex-bot thing has already been beaten to death in Sci-Fi, too.    This book could have done with a lot more development and a lot less graphic sexual abuse, but I don't know if we can hope for that from this author's future books, since the book has already won many awards and praise from all directions. I fear for the genre if this is what qualifies for the highest honors of Science Fiction.
0451529065|5.0|No matter what you think of the Alfred Russel Wallace debacle, this is a great book and filled with an abundance of information for those interested in the theory of evolution. I'd recommend a later edition as they includes more chapters and rebuttals to some of the objections raised.
B0002ZMITY|3.0|This movie came out before Bruno, before Borat, before Madagascar. This is the same character Sacha Baron Cohen played in the Ali G Show, but unlike the talk show this is very funny. Kind of outrageous, kind of clever, kind of dumb. Borat makes a cameo appearance.
B000BNI99K|5.0|Who would ever think that Ziggy Stardust could come out with a smooth and cool 4-CD set of American standards from the '30s and '40s that just sets a romantic mood and makes you want to get up and slow dance cheek to cheek. Rod you've got a HIT!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I was using a Lowepro Nova 4 which was a good size but wasn't quite big enough for everything. This backpack holds tons of accesories, a tripod, and even has room for personal items and a light jacket. It is constructed like a hiking pack. The straps are padded, the back is padded and it buckles across your chest and across your waist for added security and support. Not sure what the bungie cord on the front is for, it doesn't really tighten up, but it looks cool. I have in my pack the following items; Nikon DSLR, 50mm lens, 300mm telephoto, 2 wide angle lens, Sekonic light meter, battery charger, 10 individual cased filters 52-58mm, 2-3pk cased filters 52-58mm, 7 step up rings, 7 step down rings, 6 individually sleeved filters 52-58mm, 1 adapter ring, sd card case, lens cloth, lens pen, AA battery pack and that is on the inside. Two side pokets are empty. Very front pocket has warranty cards and manuals. My laptop almost fits it the big pocket. iPad or tablet would fit perfectly.

1449389627|4.0|I found it hard, when I first tried reading this book, to warm to it.  The essay style didn't work for me.  Perhaps I wasn't in the right frame of mind.    Then one day I opened the book at Random - as much as your can in a Kindle - and started reading.  Suddenly, I was enjoying the book.  I've read quite a bit of the book this way now - flipping randomly about the place - and it's working for me.  The book is full of brilliant observations and advice. The old photographs are fascinating.
1591843790|2.0|I am one of the many random people worldwide that received a complimentary copy of the book. And much as I feel grateful for the gift, I'll be honest. The book did not enchant. It's mostly a collection of tips that I've come across from various sources before this. What did not help was that the author re-wrote those tips in his own writing style (which is far from enchanting...actually it is tiresome!) It seems the author is more an entrepreneur than an original thinker or writer.    p.s. Btw, I got a link to a quiz on the author's FB page that offered to tell me how enchanting I was based on my responses. After filling out some 25 questions I clicked the Submit button to see my results and got a message that asked me to 'LIKE' the author's page BEFORE I could see my results. I was not enchanted. :(     p.p.s When I last checked, the quiz had been tweaked. You can now participate only AFTER you LIKE the page. Looks like the author still doesn't get it.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|Not sure why other reviews gave this album few stars at all. John Mayer is so talented and he proves it with this album once again. Love this album....very very good.
B004HAEGP4|3.0|Take two cups of the Matrix, one cup 28 Days Later, a teaspoon of Knight and Day and one cup Resident Evil series and you have this latest installment of Resident Evil: Afterlife.  Worth my $1.99 rental, story has good action but lacked depth, has a couple of how did that happen scenes, left me feeling incomplete. Liked the male eye candy.
B004A8ZWT2|4.0|With the reviews from the Net Nerds to the pros alike roundly panning The Tourist, I was dreading this movie.  I figured that The Tourist was going to be 2 hours of my life that I would never be able to get back, like the time I wasted watching Ishtar and more recently The American.  I played it on the TV for the missus (She had seen the adverts and adores Angelina Jolie, as do I frankly, and Johnny Depp) This made her insist I get a copy to play.  So with the laptop out and a peripheral view of my big screen I found myself strangely pulled into the story.  Within the first 20 minutes my laptop wasn't only being ignored but it was turned off and put away so I could give The Tourist my full attention.  It, as others had said, is in a classic thriller style which I thoroughly enjoy and the story wasn't half bad either.  I am an avid movie buff, plus I indulge in the genre of action/adventure i.e. popcorn munchers starring \\"great\\" actors like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Stallone, Chuck Norris, etc. from directors/producers like Micheal Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer.  Who says that explosions, no plot and T&A are a bad thing.  Sometimes I enjoy watching 90-120 of film with my brain mostly disengaged.<br /><br />So after all of the pans that this title had gotten I was expecting nothing, but instead got a surprisingly entertaining night of entertainment.  The Blu-ray transfer was excellent.  The video was crisp with vibrant colors and  I did not notice banding or compression artifacts whilst watching The Tourist.  The Soundtrack (DTS-MA in my case) was excellent.  I will definitely watch this film again, though I may not purchase it :P.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|As I was searching for another single I heard on the radio, I stumbled upon a sample of \\"Rolling in the Deep.\\" I was so intrigued, I forgot all about the other song. I listened to a couple samples from this CD and was hooked - I bought it immediately. I haven't been disappointed - definitely one of my new favorite artists.
B00371QQ0M|5.0|I am looking for advice on purchasing the David Lynch film Dune. I went to the movies to see the original film years ago and thought I was buying that one when it came out. No it wasn't. I am after the version that has Virginia Madsen is doing the beginning voice over. Can anyone help me with what I need to look for when buying it. I don't want to buy another wrong version again.    Cheers.
B00000G3PA|3.0|Although this movie would never qualify for an Oscar, I still love it.  I love the interplay between the characters and its when I first fell in love with Liv Tyler.  But, although its labeled \\"wide screen\\", its only letterbox with black bars on all four sides.  I have a 51 inch wide screen tv and this film would be so much better if I could see it the way I saw it in the theater!  My advise to anyone thinking of buying this DVD should wait until they upgrade the format to true wide screen.
B001F0WXY0|4.0|I LOVE this book and the movie.  The only issue I have is that nobody seems to have proofread the copy before it was published for the Kindle.  The Kindle version constantly has words that are run together likethis.  It's not too bad if it's just once in a while, but in some chapters it's several times per page.  That is the only reason I didn't give this one a 5 star review.  Otherwise, it's an excellent story.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|bruce willis does it again, works out great with the entire cast, especially with john malkovich. i have never seen the comic myself, but the movie rocked. who says talent squanders with age?
B002ZG993Q|2.0|After having this movie on my to-view list for what I thought was far too long, I finally sat down to watch what I thought would be a really wnticing movie.     Whilst George Clooney's acting is indeed, captivating, the rest of the movie drags on painfully. \nothing really happens and nothing is really being said on any level. The ethical sub-text that could be attributed would be far fetched in my oppinion.     The aim of the movie was, I think, a quiet but strong story. Unfortunatley, I think this was a seemingly endless film reel with no conclusive storyline or idea. So if you have an hour and a half at your dispoasal, do yourself a favour and watch any other George Clooney film where the acting will be as good (as it was here), but the story will sustain that.
B00004R9A4|3.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE!<br /><br />Problems with this remake:<br /><br />--Several of Prof. Browne's dialog bits are not in-sync.<br />--Only some of the German was subtitled. I definitely remember more.
0345495004|2.0|I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.  I AM TRYING TO FINISH BECAUSE IT IS A BOOK CLUB BOOK.  IT GOES ON AND ON ABOUT THINGS COULD BE COVERED IN A FEW PARAGRAPHS.  IT IS 'TOO MUCH INFORMATION'
0316098337|5.0|This book is so unique. I couldn't stop reading it. Told from a five year olds perspective, it reads so genuinely. In some parts I found myself reading so fast I couldn't get the story in fast enough. Amazing writing and theme. Great!
B00000I41G|5.0|This 1967 recording is deservedly Kenny Burrell's best known album; jazz/blues guitar par excellence. The playing from every member of the quintet is creative and restrained, and makes for a sublime and high-quality listening experience. It's perfect to set the late-night mood or for that matter, any other time of day and almost any occasion.<br /><br />The whole album is so consistently good it's almost impossible to pick out any particular highlight: it just flows, effortlessly. Burrell's playing is virtuoso, understated and minimalist; the perfect counterpoint to the fine sax playing of Stanley Turrentine. Together they weave intricate conversational pieces of intelligence and humour, backed by a clever and interesting rhythm section: Major (`The Mule') Holley Jr on bass, Bill English on drums and the excellent conga playing of Ray Barretto whose inclusion, unexpectedly, adds much to the overall sound. If the listener chooses to become involved the rewards are great, and yet the music is overall so mellow and non-intrusive it might qualify as `easy listening' without any of the usual pejorative associations with the derivative or bland.<br /><br />If your taste is beginning to mature into an appreciation of jazz, the greatest musical genre of all, then you will never regret adding this minor classic to your collection. If you like `Kind of Blue', the chances are you'll like this too.
B0006213WG|3.0|When I got their previous album, I was dissapointed that the rest of the album didn't show the kind of craftsmanship that it's amazing singles (hell song, still waiting)had. It seemed Does This Look Infected was all filler, no killer (tee hee). I thought it was just a fluke and surely an album titled after a guy the band owed their lives to must surely be awesome! Of course! The lead single \\"We're all to blame\\" was very deep and unique; \\"Pieces\\" was one of the catchiest songs of their entire career!; and \\"No Reason\\" was just straight up ridiculous. You'd think if they could create 3 amazing songs like that, then surely there must be at least 3 or 4 more on the album out of the 13. Boy, was I wrong. TBH, i'm not sure who this album will appeal to at all. It's too punk for the metal crowd; too metal for the punk crowd; and dammit...it's just not catchy. That said, I appreciated the passion that lead singer Derrick Weebler showed and some of their best singles are on here, so...
0756404738|5.0|I am so glad I picked up The Wise Man's Fear!  This book is really fantastic.  It is long but as the book was coming to an end I found myself wishing it had another thousand pages.  It intrigues the imagination, and Patrick Rothfuss words were musical.  I kept wanting Kvothe to quit thinking so much and just go with it. :)
0375851569|5.0|This collection has 5 great Dr. Seuss books for a lower price than ordering them all separately. It has the classics, \\"Cat in the Hat\\" and \\"Green Eggs and Ham\\", plus my favorite when I was a child, \\"One Fish, Two Fish\\"...which I still love now. Then, you have the beginner reader book, \\"Hop on Pop\\", plus the fun tongue-twister, \\"Fox in Socks\\". I prefer the separate books over the six stories in one book, because it's easier for the child to hold and then read on their own.
0321544080|5.0|The two authors Scott Kelby and Matt  Kloskowski are among the best in any book they write on digital photography.  Easy and fun to read with excellent demo photos to show you how to   manage, organize, and demonstrate the software you are using.  I have most of the books they have written and I have yet to be disappointed.
B0017OB12O|5.0|I originally saw this film as a child when it first came out and it made a lasting impression on me. It is one of my favorite films and one of the greatest ever made, in my opinion. The blu-ray transfer is flawless and reveals the movie as it was originally shot. What should astound modern audiences is that everything you see here is real. There are of course no digital effects, but also no models and miniatures, which was often the technique at the time. The bridge and the train are real. The bridge was built specifically for this film and there was only one chance to capture its destruction. The performances, the direction, and the story itself, (which there is no point in repeating here) are all excellent. This package, along with its extra features is a pure joy to own, and all the more so given its amazingly low price. If you've never seen the film before you are in for a treat, and if you have seen it you will find it faithfully rendered and then some. A must-have product for any serious viewer.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I have to be honest when I say that I didn't see all of the nominees in the best picture category. The King's Speech has an all-star cast and I expect that some of them will be on the Queen's Birthday Honours List this mid-June especially Oscar Winner Colin Firth. I wouldn't be surprised if Geoffrey Rush received an Australian honor as well as Helena Bonham Carter in the list. But I'm not going to spill my predictions now. It's three months away.    Anyway the story of King George VI better known as Bertie to his wife and family comes about because of his brother's abdication to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson. The scandalous relationship between his brother and Wallis fueled fear of the monarchy's destruction ever since. Ever since the scandal, the family has been wary of causing another one. In this film, Bertie must take over the reigns as King of England but he has a stammering problem since childhood. He has been to doctors and specialists. His wife finds Lionel Logue, an actor and speech therapist. The relationship between Logue and Bertie is more about friendship, trust, and understanding. Logue doesn't even tell his family that he's helping the Duke of Windsor.    There are plenty of brilliant moments in the film in depiction of pre-World War II England. Helena Bonham Carter does a fine job in playing the future Queen Mother, Elizabeth I, or the Duchess of Windsor in this film. She's supportive and loving towards Bertie. The rest of the cast includes Guy Pearce as the King who abdicates his throne for Wallis Simpson (played by Eve Best). Jennifer Ehle plays Mrs. Logue. Sir Michael Gambon plays the King and Claire Bloom plays his Queen.    When you watch the film, you realize that nobody wants to be king after all. It's not an ideal job with no privacy and very few friends rather than acquaintances and fellow politicians. The King's Speech is important because it also reflects the British people on the verge of declaring war with Germany over Poland'sinvasion.    In the end, you must imagine Bertie coming through during the country's most difficult time in the last century. The costumes, the art direction, writing, and casting is first rate and worthy of all the accolades for the film.    I still can't wait for the honours list though to see the accolades from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II herself.
B004GIX5JK|5.0|A must-see!!! Jean Seberg is an amazing actress!  After I watch this movie, I always wish I had lived in the 50's, had a home on the Cote d'Azur, and could dance the night away in Paris!  Of course, the issues in the movie are dark...I think I have understood this movie on different levels as I have watched it at different ages during my life.  - I highly recommend it...especially to students of French...It is a great introduction to the work of Francoise Sagan.  The book which inspired the movie is a good first novel for French students--fairly easy to read.
B002ZG980U|1.0|Please explain. This is not entertainment. If you need to take notes, pause the film and compare your notes with the others watching it with you, and then vote about what happened, etc., - you're not being entertained. I know they were trying to make this a \\"smart\\" film and I \\"got it\\". It just could have been done better without the pretentiousness and the overdone special effects.  Boo.....overrated.
B000002H2H|5.0|sure, Hetfield sings a little sharper than now, but C'MON! This record was sooooo hard when it dropped. I didn't even like Metal and this record was thumbs up for me.  Forget their commercial non-sense. These guys can play; tasteful solos, good vocals, crisp production and notable group dynamics. HOWEVER, nobody ever mentioned that the first song is damn near a cop from Ozzy's Goodbye To Romance. Extra points for me ;)  Seriously, if Maiden, Randy Rhoads, and Iommi created and changed the face of Metal players; it's Metallica that continues to endure and have young shredders locking themselves in bedrooms trying to learn Kirk's riffs.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Masterful series. Rivetting,compelling. I am eagerly looking for Season Two with 13 episodes. Great characters, great acting, great story, great filming and sequences. Suspenseful and chilling. No ridiculous zombie/humor here with half-baked characters or sub-marginal types posing as heroes.There are some real heroes here, of all races and genders. No Olympic sprinting zombies. This is the real deal straight out of George Romero's playbook. Serious action, and quality actors who develop both complex and compassionate characters that you can really care about. The world has been waiting for a really quality series based on zombies and here it is. Ten stars.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|adele's newest album proves that she is no flash in the pan!<br /><br />the songs for this collection are grittier, funkier and urban in a way that her debut '19' wasn't.  it is clear that she is not only in strong, sure voice but she is also finding her way to some excellent collaborators and producers. they are bringing out the very best in her as an artist. artist. you don't get to use that word often enough with a lot of the current crop of singers. they are circus performers (not to offend circus performers) that go for flash and easily won applause. they don't care if they affect you on a deep level.<br /><br />such is not the case with this disc.<br /><br />my favorite track sits right in the middle--'he won't go'. adele is at her most earthy on this song for me. and what's she's doing is something that pays homage to earthy honest singers like dusty springfield and mary wilson. no tricks--just pure emotion, restraint and the gentlest of turns at the end of a note--an occasional note.<br /><br />i also enjoy the first two tracks on the disc=='rolling in the deep' and 'rumour has it'.  they are solid grooves that are perfect for motivating a killer workout or a long trek through the grocery store. speaking of which, i should be headed there. so, earphones in--'21' on--and systems go!
B000GW8RX4|4.0|This was the best version of Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow!<br />Even though they were all great! Dio is the King of Hard<br />Rock/Metal Singers! There is and never will be another.<br />I've had this on video for years and wore it out. I've<br />been a fan since I heard Man on Silver Mountain when I<br />was 13! This dvd captures how great rock n roll was<br />back then and will never be again. I agree with one<br />guy about Blackmore's long solo's they do get zzzzzz<br />at times! Dio holds this show together. This is a show<br />just before Long Live Rock n Roll was released and<br />it's cool they do a different version here! maybe the<br />original version? Anyway you got Bob Daisley on bass<br />and Cozy Powell on drums! THUNDER! The band is smokin<br />and the played some of Rainbow's greatest songs up to<br />that point. This is hard rock school for all the<br />young rock musicians out there! DIO RIP!
B004AKCME8|3.0|Although this movie was visualing appealing, I just couldn't get into it. My nine-year-old grandson liked it OK but it's not a favorite. Wish I could have liked the movie more. I had high hopes but the plot seemed to drag. Nothing really wrong with the movie, I just didn't enjoy it.
B000N7KTBU|5.0|I have purchased several of these over the past few years.  They are simple, no-nonsense 2.5 inch HD enclosures that do the job well.  With the drive inserted, it feels more solid that several brand-name external HDs that I've owned.  They never get warm and the drive is nice and snug inside the enclosure.  I've never noticed a drive vibrating while reading or writing either.    All in all, it's a solid buy.
B00005JPAO|5.0|A very well handled portrayal of how difficult it was for the royal family to deal with the death of Princess D.<br /><br />It shows the personal struggles within the family, and the sensitive attempts by Tony Blair to advise and encourage them to accept the public's need to share in the grief.<br /><br />A great movie.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|\\"Serenity\\" is the name of the space vessel in this space-western movie.  The name seems to be based on the valley Serenity where Captain Mal and his first mate Zoe were the lone survivors in a battle against the Alliance. They were part of the resistance, but after they--The Brown Coats--lost the war, Mal still resisted assimilation and aquired a \\"Firefly class\\" cargo space ship, and. along with his assorted crew of nine, basically continued to operate on the fringes of society. Their adventures are the subject of the TV series \\"Firefly\\".  Among the ship's crew is a talented young doctor, Simon Tam (Sean Maher) and his rather mysterious younger sister, River (Summer Glau). As it turns out, River, though she has been highly traumatized by the Alliance through special \\"schooling\\" they had her in, has some extrodinary gifts, including being a psychic and having astonishing fighting skills. Simon had risked his life and gave up a prestigious career to rescue her from the Alliance and they are hell-bent on getting her back. The action of the movie centers around the Alliance, in the person of a nameless yet fearsome operative nicely played by Chiwetel Ejiofer, hunting down Serenity in order to recapture or kill the young prodigy. Captian Mal and crew are really not aware of who she is or the risk they are under, yet they end up actually having similar goals in resisting the domination of the Alliance and exposing the truth about them, at least insofar as planet Miranda and the identity of the Reavers, a bestial and violent human-variant.    As I said, the movie does have quite a lot of action. Like the TV series, it sometimes seems like a cowboy shoot 'em up show, only in outer space. The characters have a peculiar way of speaking--they use \\"ain't\\", and the leave the gs off of the end of verbs, which makes them seem \\"country\\", but they also sometimes mutter phrases in Chinese or use words like \\"gorom\\" or \\"verse\\".  Zoe (Gina Torres) is tough as nails, and she uses a sawed-off shotgun. Jewel Strait as Kaylee, is a chipper young girl who is also a mechanical genius who keeps the scarred and embattled Serenity running. Other characters are equally colorful. The story worked pretty well. I like how they showed flash-backs to River's childhood in school where she didn't just accept everything she was being taught, and also at the end where we learned more about the Reavers and how they came about. Entertaining.
B0034G4OXQ|3.0|In \\"Hereafter\\" are told three seemingly unrelated stories, about French news reporter Marie Lelay (Cécile De France), who survives the horrifying tsunami while on vacation; a San Francisco factory worker and retired psychic George Lonegan (Matt Damon), who considers his unusual abilities as a curse; and London twins Marcus and Jason (Frankie and George McLaren) living with their substance-addicted mother.    I am not going to repeat what other reviewers have rightly said about Clint Eastwood's latest film. It is quiet and thoughtful (with the effectively moody cinematography from Tom Stern). This is not a supernatural thriller, but a drama about those who are trying to cope with the inevitable or, perhaps more precisely, its consequence. The theme is immediate and the film is well-intentioned, I know that for sure.    With all respect to veteran director Clint Eastwood and the serious subject matter that is dealt here, however, narrative of \\"Hereafter\\" is disappointingly flat. It is not boring. It is, for lack of better word, predictable. About one hour in, you get where three stores are leading us, and the way the film is trying to reach there is not very compelling, but just contrived.     Peter Morgan, screenwriter of \\"Frost/Nixon\\" fame, fails to invest his characters with enough personality to further each story. Many say the opening tsunami sequence looks hauntingly real. I agree. But I just don't see how Marie's near-death experience influenced her life after the shocking event. What these characters experience has profound dimensions, loss and sadness resonant to us all. Sadly, what they are (and do after their life-changing experiences) does not generate emotional resonance.
B001EN71DG|5.0|This was bought as a gift for a grandaughter that requested it.  I have to say I did not watch it so cannot comment on the quality.
B00475AYJQ|2.0|The Name of the Wind was a good book.  I hadn't read a fantasy novel in 5 years.  I picked up TNotW because I was looking for something that could satiate me a bit while I continue to wait for George RR Martin to come back to life and finish his series (by far the best I've ever read).  And to clean it up now that's it become clear in later books that he may not have the skill to conclude the story.      TNotW was attractive b/c it sounded like a good novel, but also because I read that Rothfuss had finished the trilogy and that DAW would roll out one book per year.  Great - no more George Martin non-sense of waiting for a decade and no chance that the writer had thought of a good beginning, an OK middle but was unable (or unwilling) to pull together their vast world and plotlines for a conclusion.  Unfortunately, I didn't do my independent research on the facts of Rothfuss and this series.  Now that I'm on to book two, I learn that it has taken years to get here, Book 3 doesn't yet exist, and Book 2 seems to move none of the major plotlines in a meaningfully forward direction.  Sigh.  I'm done with Rothfuss.  Please, publishers and editors, ask your new writers to finish their stories before you start publishing.  Or have them write a stand-alone novel first so they get some practice and perspective at writing something complete.
1569242739|5.0|I have owned this book for a few years now and I have baked my way through almost half of it. This is no exaggeration: ALL of the recipes in this book are amazing. They are well-written and the cupcakes turn out perfect every single time! Thanks to the authors for creating this truly great book!
B003L20IFQ|1.0|**SPOILER ALERT**  I'm telling you right now, at the beginning of my review, I'm going to reveal what happens at the end of the movie.  And I'm doing so because I'm angry and had I known prior to renting this movie the outcome, I never would have rented it.  So if you want to watch how everything plays out, please move along to another review.  Now...I was intrigued by the premise - guy wakes up in a box (coffin), doesn't know how he got in there, is buried with a few items (cell phone, lighter) and must try to figure out a way to escape.  And the entire movie takes place within that confined space.  Okay, I'm with you.  &#34;Die Hard&#34; in a box; let's go.  Here's what happens in a nutshell - Paul Conroy reaches out to various people on the cell phone (the display is in some Arabic/Farci language, so that's one obstacle), gets put on hold, transferred to voicemail or hung up on (by the way - who doesn't know the main FBI office is in Washington DC?).  He finally reaches the right person to ensure him that they are working on his rescue and are narrowing down a fix on the signal of the cell phone.  Hope springs eternal.  The supposed captor calls Paul and tells him $5 million dollars for his release.  The U.S. government refuses to pay.  He is reassured by his one contact that there was a guy in a similar situation who was rescued before and was living his life back in the states.  Great; more hope.  The captor sends Paul a video email of his coworker being assasinated, and tells him that his wife and family are next unless Paul sends an email video of him cutting off his own finger.  In desperation, Paul does it.  Pretty grim, but Paul is assurred that his rescuers have pinpointed where he is and to hang on for 3 more minutes.  Paul reaches his mother (who has Alzheimers) to have what he knows will be his last conversation with her, and wants to tell her he loves her.  She doesn't remember who he is.  Due to explosions above, the box/coffin is punctured and sandbegins to filter in and fill up the coffin.  Almost there, you hear the digging going on.  With one bar left on the cell phone, Paul FINALLY gets to speak with his wife (who he hadn't been able to reach on her cell phone throughout the entire movie).  He tells her that he is being rescued, he loves her, he's sorry he has neglected her and that he will be home soon.  She tearfully makes him promise her over and over that he will be home soon and he promises her.  He has to hang up on her because his rescuer is calling him.  He disconnects with her, leaving her with the hope that he'll be home soon to see her and their son.  The rescuer regretfully tells him that they haven't found him after all.  We find out that he lied from before; they actually found the body of the other guy who he said they had rescued and was back at home.  He apologizes.  The sand continues to bury Paul until....he dies.  Black.  Credits roll.  Oh, but at least Paul's family back home will receive death benefits from the company Paul was working for in Iraq, so at least they'll be taken care of, right?  Actually, no.  That company called Paul as he was DYING to accuse him of having an affair with his coworker who was assasinated (what basis they had for that decision is never made clear), and because that supposedly breached the contract Paul signed with them, they were firing him.  And because his employment was terminated prior to his death, Paul's family would not receive any benefits.  And let's not forget that since the ransom was not paid, the terrorists (who have Paul's driver's license) know the address of Paul's family and will now go kill them, and will most likely get away with it.  Wow, what an inciteful entertaining movie to talk about over dinner afterwards.  Wait a minute - WHAT THE FRIGGIN' EFF???!!!!  ARE YOU FRIGGIN' KIDDING ME??  Now look.  Don't give me this crap about not all entertainment has to be happy, Hollywood, &#34;everything ends up fine&#34; kind of ending.  I love (and own) &#34;Moulin Rouge&#34; - didn't have a happy ending.  Thoroughly enjoyed &#34;American Beauty&#34; - didn't have a happy ending.  And don't go on about how this form of &#34;entertainment&#34; was about actually witnessing the emotional and harrowing journey firsthand of how being in this situation would be.  You don't have to spell out for me what it must be like to be eaten by a shark.  I don't need to sit through 90 minutes of seeing some bleed to death from getting their leg caught in a bear trap.  I don't need to see a movie about being a plane that slams into the side of building and everybody dies - I can pretty much imagine those are not pleasant experiences, and if that scenario is actually worse, why would I want to watch something that's worse than my own imagination?  With the movie &#34;127 Minutes&#34; (**another spoiler alert**), he went through that horrible experience, but at least he escaped and was able to continue living his life!  Where is the payoff of no hope?  I will give the movie this - for an entire movie to take place in a confined area like this, the director really has to be imaginative with how the movie is shot, and from that standpoint, he kept it interesting.  And as there were no other visible &#34;co-stars&#34; per se (except a cameo from a snake...), Ryan Reynolds really had his work cut out for him, and he did a great job as an actor.  And I understand that some foreign directors make movies that have a rather grim opinion of &#34;entertainment&#34; (like the laughfest &#34;Pan's Labyrinth&#34;).  But as far as the general story, if you're going to put the viewer through this, you'd BETTER have some sort of a resolution other than he's placed in that situation AND he dies; otherwise what is the point?  In the movie description, &#34;Paul has only ninety minutes to be rescued before his worst nightmare comes true.&#34;  Well, his (and everyone else's) worse nightmare DOES come true.  So what lesson do we take away from this movie?  What have we gained from watching this experience?  Here it is - certain Iraqis don't think very highly of Americans, and bad things tend to happen over there.  OH, GEE - REALLY??  I'm pretty sure everyone knows that the world is a horrible place and that these things (or worse) go on.  I know the reality; I don't need to see something like this played out in real time unless I can be rewarded with a happy outcome.  That is &#34;escapism&#34; which is what entertainment should be.
B000007NYS|5.0|This cd has spent more time on our player and brought more smiles and dancing than any disc we own ..the 20, 30 ,40 ,50 ,60 year olds all love it... Wait a minute,Maybe  \\"Too Late to Stop Now' by Van Morrison has been played more, but then again, that album has been around for going on 40 years!!   Not a bad cut, covers all of Lucinda's strengths.   Who can say what \\" genius \\" is? I can...listen to this and you will know too.Freakish genius.
B001KZVQJI|1.0|I had recently bought the Blu-Ray of Jackson's KONG thinking it would be the best quality, possibly showing me even more detail the CG artists put in. Unfortunately paired with my 120-Hz TV and PS3 player it turned out to be too good! I haven't seen such a false looking movie until now. I could almost see the green screen behind the actors. I must say that Jack Black in HD was not something I needed to see in my lifetime. The disparity between live action and CG was much too obvious. KONG ended up in my local used store and I will most likely stick to Animated (Pixar) movies for my Blu-Ray experience. I would rather have a DVD keep me involved than have the most quality video killing the \\"movie-magic\\". If you have a decent theater setup I would steer away from the Blu-Ray and go with the DVD instead.[[ASIN:B00005JO20 King Kong (Widescreen Edition)]]
B004EJUMT2|4.0|I was hesitant to buy this album at first due to the silly Satanic leanings of the band, but I'm certainly glad that I did as this is an impressive album! Ghost sound like a blend of Blue Oyster Cult and Mercyful Fate, and also have a definite New Wave of British Heavy Metal feel to their sound. Opening the album with the funereal dirge of an organ is rather uninspired, but after that it's all stunningly good. The tunes are melodic and catchy and every song is a corker. The pick of the bunch has to be the closing instrumental song \\"Genesis\\" which is reminiscent of classic Iron Maiden. My only complaint is that the album is too short, with a running time of just 35 minutes, but with songs of this quality the brevity of the album can easily be forgiven.
B003KGBISY|5.0|Criterion is the Bentley of home video.  Even if you own previous releases, this is worth the double or triple dip.  Akira Kurosawa is one of the great masters of cinema art, (maybe the greatest next to Tarkovsky) and his powers are in full force in this 1954 saga about the denizens of a small village seeking protection from a gang of brutal, marauding thieves.  Words cannot do justice to this universally praised epic tone poem of action, energy and emotion that must be seen in its full 204 minute Blu-ray version to be fully appreciated.  This title is the definition of the term \\"Essential Cinema.\\"
B00005JL96|5.0|My son fell for the Stitch character while at Disney. Although several years old, this DVD was in great shape and he really enjoys it. Now he wants every DVD from the series.
B0044XV3QY|3.0|Widely derided as derivative in numerous ways and from many sources (Poul Anderson anyone?), never-the-less James Cameron's film (he wrote, produced and directed) struck a nerve with a wide audience who made this big screen 3-D adventure an entertainment event.  Brilliant marketing was in sync with everything from concerns of environmental activists to liberal political wonks.  Some even saw it as a kind of spiritual meditation or mandala.  The theatrical release broke every movie for initial gross receipts with over $3 billion in revenue (not counting the multiple DVD and Blu-ray editions).  But more than anything, this film is mostly a technological and engineering achievement.  The hi-def 3-D \\"Extended Edition\\" looks great and adds a back-story with nuanced moments here and there that enhance the viewing experience.  The \\"Extended Collector's Edition\\" includes three versions of the movie and hours of generous extras plus 3-D for the home advanced theater.
B000002LTU|3.0|Miles Davis’ posthumously-released ‘Doo-Bop’ sees him once again pushing his own personal musical boundaries and embracing new styles, in this case rap and hip-hop (in the ascendancy in the late 1980s). Rapper Easy Mo Bee supplies many of the slammin’ beats and the rap vocal on three tracks.<br /><br />The result is a mixed bag, felt by most connoisseurs of Miles’ prolific output over 40 years of musical virtuosity and innovation to be definitely not among his best. It’s hard to dissent from this view, as the album overall is samey and lacks the depth, complexity and vision which characterises his greatest work. However it does work on its own terms and is popular with the younger crowd, so might offer an accessible gateway into jazz for a listener more comfortable with hip-hop rhythms who then might be encouraged to further explore Davis’ extensive and varied back catalogue.<br /><br />Miles’ trumpet playing here is as sharp, inventive and captivating as ever, with his instantly recognisable style. The production values are a little rough, intentionally, to give edge to the ‘doo-bop sound.’ We can only speculate that had Davis lived another couple of years, we might have had a different collection of tracks featuring other rap artists, a more thoughtful and interesting result and a more fitting final paragraph to the epic novel of one of the 20th century’s greatest musical legacies.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I never heard of the comics till the movie came out. This movie is so over the top fantastic, it is one of my all-time favorites. I've watched it 5 times already...I've never seen anything like it.I'm buying the books next week!
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|I got this movie because I am a Kate Winslet & Ralph Fiennes fan. The performace was astounding. I want to see why Kate was nominated for best actress in this movie, now I know why. The story was very enriched, with a profound screenplay. I am glad to have purchase this movie for my library.
B004PA50JM|5.0|Count me in with the crowd that thought REM died long ago with the release of Up. However, with the catchy all out rock re-invention that was Accelerate, I thought perhaps the band might still have something left in them. Now, the guys have re-affirmed my addiction to the 80's/90's band that I fell in love with. Collapse Into Now is a superb collection of everything I used to love about the band....and I can't stop playing it.
B002KSPKRS|3.0|EDIT:  I have owned this unit for about 14 months and it is starting to fail.  I noticed a loud pop a couple of days ago and then the audio started cutting out in the highs and lows.  It seems there is a loose wire or something in the headset and depending on how I move it, it stops working.  I may be shopping for a new headset *sigh*  I edited my score to three stars to compensate for the short life of the X41's.    The headset is very good, but make sure you read a lot of reviews first.  There are a couple of issues that may be dealbreakers, my main issue is the hook up of the box and an issue with having to buy a part for my Xbox, read on for more info.  I was not prepared for this when I bought it.    Pros - First, the main reason I bough the headset was because it is wireless and I have a large living room and a drawer absolutely full of electronics already.  Being able to leave the control box, which doubles as a stand out was very appealing.  I can safely say on that front that it came through with flying colors.  I am really happy with the overall design.  Also, this was spurred on because I tend to wake up far earlier than my wife and I enjoy getting a couple of hours of gaming in before she wakes up.  I enjoy being able to hear my games, so having a headset is a plus for her as I won't accidentally wake her up.  Instead, all she will hear is my quiet cursing at 12 year olds pummeling me during multi-player matches.    Also, on the surface of the issue(see more below) the hook up is pretty straight forward and easy.  I have seem some of the boxes that come with other wired headsets and they look like a squid overlord has taken over.    The sound quality for a wireless headset is pretty good.  I can't say I'm \\"blown away\\", but during gameplay, it is full and I get a sense of the general direction(forward, back sometimes).  But in reality, you can't stuff a full, high quality 7.1 system in a headset, it just doesn't work despite the marketing.  So don't believe that you will achieve it with any headset.  I will touch more on this in the Cons section.    The headset is comfortable enough for marathon game sessions.  My only complaint is that the ear cups are a little hard, so when I wear glasses, my noggin will get a little sore by my ears from my glasses being lightly pushed into my head for so long.    The stand and headset are not too bad.  They just aren't for me.  I only wish all this came in black so it would blend in a little better, let's see...black TV, Black Stereo, Black X-Box, Black Blu-Ray player, black center channel surround speaker, Dark wood Entertainment Center, goofy plastic bright white headset and stand.  One of these kids is not like the others.    CONS: Here was one that really peeved me...I had to buy the proprietary Xbox 360 Audio out.  Let me explain.  I am on my second Xbox, you know the pre-slim elite with an HDMI and the proprietary outlet for component, analog, etc.  They sell(an expensive) on that has analog outs and a TOSlink or Optical out depending on how you refer to it.  Which you need to use the X41.  You see logic would dictate that the HDMI from my Xbox to the TV, which then feeds my stereo would be okay.  However, hooking the TOSlink cable(optical) from my TV to my X41 box did not work at all.  Looked online for a while, tried the Xbox one, and it worked fine.  Stupid, yes, dealbreaker, almost.  I really hate proprietary parts and having to fork over more money for parts I don't really need.  Of course I say this as I write on my Macbook Pro which is full of proprietary stuff.    Okay, It's wireless, that being said there is an ever-present, very slight hiss that is there with anything wireless.  Also, if my batteries get low, there can be a weird and loud POP.  You will hear about it in other reviews ad nauseum.    PRO-TIP:  On the note of batteries, buy some AAA Sony cycle energy, or Sanyo Eneloop rechargeables for your headset(Both awesome, Energizers are awful).  Really want tosave some money in the long term?  Buy some for your controllers(AA) if you don't already have a play an charge Li-Ion battery kit.  I have made my money back many times over and actually prefer the rechargeable batteries over the Li-Ion rechargeable pack due to the short cord that comes with that and the fact that my X-box remains on if I am not playing, sucking more juice just to charge a battery.
0446569895|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Ozzy's, have been for many years. By no means am I as dedicated or as long lasting a fan as others who will have read this book, and if I'm honest, I'm not that much into rock music at all. Ozzy has always seemed like a man that, despite his success, has managed to keep his feet firmly on the ground. Being fascinated by the character of Ozzy for quite a number of years, I was excited to hear that he'd brought a book out and looked forward to learning about a man I'd admired for a long time. No doubt this book is informative, and at times, very funny, but it wasn't quite what I had expected.<br /><br />I am not one to read these celebrity type books, and let's face it, this is yet another one that is just a cheap cash-in on a famous name. It's clear from the get-go that the actual writer (co-written by Chris Ayres because of Ozzy's dyslexia) wanted to give a \\"conversations with Ozzy\\" feel. He clearly wanted to give the feeling that you were sitting in the same room with the man and he was telling you the story of his life as if Ozzy and the reader were sat in the pub together. The attempt of it failed miserably, which I found immensely disappointing. It didn't quite flow as you would expect and I constantly felt like I was reading a book, and not discovering the life of Ozzy.<br /><br />To not sound completely nuts I'll try and explain. When reading a good book, you lose yourself in the pages. This isn't exclusive to fantasy novels where you envisage yourself taking part in the intimacies of the story, or can simply picture the events as if watching a superb movie. A good writer can achieve the same effect from an autobiography to the point where you forget you're reading a book and actually feel like you're having the conversation with the person you're reading about. That was never achieved with this book, which is wholly disappointing. All the hardcore Ozzy fans should definitely give this a read, but I'm not promising you will be able to lose yourself in the pages.ges.

B002ZG981E|5.0|Christopher Nolan, being relatively unknown until he rebooted the Batman franchise, has managed to produce the best film of 2010 and possibly one of the best films of the decade. He manages to take fantasy concepts and bring them into the real world, no matter how crazy they may seem. Batman is one of his projects that he wanted to remove from the comic book fantasy and bring it into the real world to the point the viewer would be thinking \\"so this is really possible\\". Although it may seem crazy, Inception is one of those movies. Although using technology and ideas that don't yet exist in reality, it uses concepts such as Lucid dreaming and dream incubation and places them in reality. Although it may seem crazy, I think that one day we will develop such an understanding of dreams and the unconscious mind that things such ideas as depicted in the film will be possible.<br /><br />Although being a genius of film making, he's also excellent in confusing the hell out of the viewer, and if you aren't paying attention for the entire runtime, you will find yourself to be absolutely lost. The story centres around dream thieves, Dominick (Leo DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Well they're not actual dream thieves, more secret thieves. They dream together and break into the unconscious minds of other sleepy people in the hope of discovering some deep and dark secrets about them. They're approached by Saito (Ken Watanabe) who offers Dominick the freedom to return home to the US (where he's wanted for murder of his wife) if he can perform Inception, the act of planting ideas in the mind of another person through their dreams. The victim of said Inception is Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), the son of a wealthy business man who is about to inherit a massive corporate empire. In order to carry the inception, Dominick and Arthur employ the services of the dream architect, Ariadne (Ellen Page), identity forger, Eames (Tom Hardy) and the sedative guy, Yusuf (Dileep Rao).<br /><br />If the story didn't sound complicated enough, it goes even deeper into the ideas and concepts of dreams that will really knock you if you aren't paying attention from the start. Involving numerous levels of dreams, you become lost in what is exactly the reality. This is a beautifully crafted film that blends stunning special effects with spectacular acting, dialogue and action. Some scenes are just bizarre but wonderfully put together, such as the scene showing Paris being folded on itself. One particular standout moment, however, is the anti-gravity fight sequence involving Joseph Gordon-Levitt, one of those amazing, but criminally underrated actors. This is a visually mind-blowing scene which becomes a centrepiece of the entire film.<br /><br />This is a genius venture by Nolan and seals his legendary status. He is a true cinematic master and this is just an example of the wondrous stories he can bring to the big screen. Everyone must own this film, because without it, you're better off dead.e story didn't sound complicated enough, it goes even deeper into the ideas and concepts of dreams that will really knock you if you aren't paying attention from the start.

B002ZG98FU|4.0|Good casting and an interesting storyline combine to make an entertaining film about an executive producer of a struggling morning TV show and her conflicts with a difficult, stubborn news anchor, played by Harrison Ford.    There is a great soundtrack as well.   The script is much better written than are most scripts for movies these days, and this is also a help.
030746363X|2.0|If something sounds too good to be true, it usually is--like this book's title.  This guy makes it seem like he knows the secret shortcut to a perfect body and sex life.  If you believe that, you'll be disappointed.  what he does is rehash bits and pieces of common knowledge about diet, nutrition, exercise, and sex.  Some of it worthwhile (which is why I gave 2 stars) but most of it old news or worse, without any real proof that it works--just him saying so. It reads quickly, but sometimes I felt his ADD on the page. He's a brilliant marketer, but don't get your health advice here.
1401309666|3.0|Based on an article that was once published in The Wired, The Long Tail explains in detail the concept for which it is named.  Chris Anderson called this book The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More to explain the following principle: Our economy is no longer focused on a small number of products at the head of the demand curve.  Rather, our economy is now focused on a large number of niches at the tail of the curve.  At one point, our culture faced a scarcity problem.  Now, we have a limitless inventory.  Therefore, not only are the \\"blockbusters\\" selling, but also the non-blockbusters.  The long tail phenomenon is a result of the new digital age, and the book explains how the Internet is changing our behavior and habits.  I was very much a part of the rise of the digital age in the 1990s.  Therefore, the phenomenon that Anderson talks about has affected me greatly.  In order to be successful in the future, it is important for us to understand this new culture.  Anderson has made it clear that we must react appropriately to this change in order to compete in the global economy.  Among other things, the Internet has made it possible for companies to sell their products and services all over the world.  Take eBay for example.  eBay is able to connect buyers in Asia with sellers in South America.  Retail chains like Nike have different sites for different continents, making it possible for anyone in the world to purchase their products.  In its simplest form, the Internet has made it easy for people to find whatever product or service it is they are searching for online.  This means that there is demand for almost everything.  Companies have reacted to this increased demand by keeping a large inventory of products.  A decade ago, this would have cost an organization too much money.  However, the costs associated with inventory have diminished greatly in the digital age.  For example, it does not cost iTunes anything to carry one additional CD or Amazon anything to post one additional book.  In Amazon's case, someone is holding the book for them, ready to ship it when a consumer purchases the product on the Amazon website.   Unlike many other books I have read recently, The Long Tail discussed companies that I frequent everyday.  Companies like Google and Amazon have influenced my behavior in many of the ways that Anderson discussed.  For example, Amazon not only carries every book I could possibly want, but also recommends books for me.  Google hosts my personal email, documents, and contacts.  More importantly, Goggle allows me to seek out any information that I need.   The only downside that I found with The Long Tail is that it has already become slightly outdated.  This is the case with really any book about the Internet or technology.  There was nothing in The Long Tail that I did not already know in some way.  The changes that Anderson described have become commonplace and self-evident.  That being said, the way in which Anderson described the long tail phenomenon was very well done.  He made the concept easy to grasp by using examples that readers are very familiar with.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Finally we have a star-packed movie that lives up to the billing. Bruce Willis is in excellent form in both the action and the comedy aspects of his character. Morgan Freeman gives his usual, excellent performance. Mary Louise Parker plays a character that, I thought, was much younger than the actress...and pulls it off without a hitch. John Malkovich is as creepy, funny, and far-out as ever. Dame Helen Mirren is, at one point, wearing an evening gown, combat boots, and firing a 50-caliber machine gun; how can a movie get any better than that!<br /><br />The romantic story line shows a lot of chemistry between Willis and Parker; I hope they get to work together again because there is definitely a good on-screen harmony between them. The characters seem like a group of old friend who'd been apart for a while. The action is driven by a story that stays consistent and doesn't rely on miracles to bring everything together.<br /><br />The action, suspense, and comedy is non-stop. The plot actually makes sense and I can imagine a lot of old soldiers sitting around looking at certain developments and saying, &#34;Yep, that's what I would have done there too.&#34; :-)<br /><br />If you are a fan of action or romantic comedy (trust me, my wife liked this movie as much as I did) you'll love R.E.D.

B0009UC7QQ|3.0|It's amazing that none of the reviews I've read give credit to Rod Serling's brillant 1960 Twilight Zone episode, \\"World of Difference\\" which probably birthed the idea for \\"The Truman Show\\" since they are so much alike.  In \\"World of Difference,\\" the actor Jerry Raigan thinks he really is Arthur Curtis, the businessman with the perfect wife, perfect life until he discovers that the prop phone in his \\"office\\" is dead and someone in the background yells, \\"Cut!\\" The rest of the episode deals with Raigan's frantic search to recreate his happy life.  Fortunately, he succeeds and escapes back into his \\"reality.\\"  Sound familiar?  Yep!  Most great sci-fi deas originated on Twilight Zone, so let's give credit where credit is due - Richard Matheson's great script on TV's greatest series - Twilight Zone!

1401225756|5.0|I am by no means a graphic novel aficionado. I was guided gently to the genre through Alan Moore's \\"The Watchman\\" and I loved it (the movie was great too!). After soliciting suggestions for further readings from friends they all recommended Gaiman's Sandman series and I'm grateful. This book chronicles the pursuit of the anthropomorphic hero Dream to recapture 3 objects of power which were stolen from him after a \\"summoning gone wrong\\". After the first chapter I assumed that the rest of the book would plod through an unassuming, routine treasure hunt, but I was an idiot. Preludes and Nocturnes is hideously creative and quickly spirals into what I'm told is typical Gaiman: riveting, chaotic, and at times disgusting entertainment. Gaiman is very good at creating those suspenseful junctures in stories that force the reader to ask \\"What the hell could possibly happen next!?\\" in a fit of nail biting anxiety. The artwork (Sam Keith, Mike Dringenberg, Malcolm Jones III) is equally incredible.    In short: Buy the book. Make a pot of coffee. Enjoy the madness. (Then buy the rest of the series!)
B003L20IJM|5.0|This is such a fun family movie for all ages. A magical fantasy sequel. Right up there with Mary Poppins. There is some slap stick kind of comedy and rude behavior which is fixed by Nanny McPhee who teaches them good lessons in discipline, helpfulness, bravery and selflessness. A great movie which can give an opportunity for families to talk about these lessons.

B0044FEZBC|5.0|This ballet is somewhere between classical ballet and folk dancig. The costumes are theatrical clothes accordng to the charecters. This ballet is from the Soviet era about the french revolution and it has been reconstructed in order to reduce the political agenda and add love stories. The sound and image are very good. The dances are partly classical and partly folk dancing. Celebrating their love affair, the principal dancers had out of this world performance near the end of this ballet. What bothers here is the frequent audience shouts and applauds that disturb the dancers.

B004132I20|4.0|The recent Guy Ritchie version of Sherlock Holmes got me interested in the character and universe of the London detective. Unfortunately, the film can only go so far. I decided to check this out based on my prior knowledge of creator Steven Moffat, and I was blown away by this modern day reimagining. Benedict Cumberbatch is phenomenal as the Myopic Sleuth, combining an almost endless tech knowledge with a great wit. Martin Freeman, on of my favorite British actors, is the standout as Dr. John Watson, an Afghanistan War Veteran back in London after an injury on the battlefield. Una Stubbs and Zoe Telford are also entertaining as supporting characters, and the setting gives a unique atmosphere. My one complaint is that episode 2, The Blind Banker, is tedious, and less entertaining than episodes 1 and 3. Other than that minor issue, this set is a must buy.
B000FZETIO|5.0|Another great movie..as most of us know. It came packaged so very safe.  And the prices can't be beat, which is one of the many things I feel make it worth ordering from Amazon... And it comes right to your front door!
0823095223|4.0|I initially thought this book would be full of step by step instructions for sculpting action figures in clay. I was sort of right. It does contain a tutorial for sculpting two action figures but in wax. I primarily work with polymer clay and the instructional guide in this book uses an oil-based clay that is molded and cast then finished in wax. A very tedious and lengthy process to say the least. This is not intended to discourage anyone from purchasing this however as it is a great book. It summarizes the history of pop sculture as well as tells you what professional artists prefer as a medium including poly cay, wax, oil-based clays, and epoxie putty. There are tool suggestions, workspace organization tips, as well as reference material sources. I just expected to see instructionals on several different mediums of clay and sculpting materials.

0195145925|5.0|This is a serious book about his own work, and Julian Barbour should be commended for reaching such a wide audience. He obviously shares the opinions of Einstein and Feynman that if you understand a new theory thoroughly you should be able to explain it to the layman.<br /><br />If you want to combine Einstein's theory of gravity with quantum mechanics, it is well known that there are serious obstacles.<br /><br />First obstacle: GR(General Relativity) is real and QM (quantum mechanics) is complex. (By complex, we mean z = x + iy, where i is the square root of -1.)<br /><br />JB (Julian Barbour) attacks this problem using his two main weapons: History and Philosophy.<br /><br />History: Schrodinger's first equation (I didn't know this) was real. It was also the one that he used to solve the problem of the hydrogen atom, which got him the Nobel prize.<br /><br />But Schrodinger's first equation also was static--i.e. timeless. It was also a first order differential equation.<br /><br />When Schrodinger later was developing his equation for the amplitude function that evolved with time, he was horrified to find that it turned into a second order differential equation, in which second derivatives appear. To bring it back down to a first order equation again, he used the trick that electrical engineers use: He introduced complex numbers. When they say that the impedance of a coil of wire is complex, it isn't really complex. This is just a mathematical trick based on the fact that AC current is sinusoidal and therefore satisfies a simple second order differential equation. By using complex numbers, they eliminate, in this case, differential equations altogether.<br /><br />So Schrodinger eliminated second derivatives at the cost of making the amplitude complex.<br /><br />Philosophy: JB's secoond weapon. He is an expert on Mach's two Principles. The second principle states essentially that inertia is an effect of the distant matter in the universe. JB uses this principle to produce a totally new geometry that he calls \\"Platonia,\\" in which there is no time.<br /><br />JB believes that GR and QM can be combined in Platonia into a timeless theory. In his view, we must unshackle QM from the confines of Euclidean geometry and its Lorenz variant.<br /><br />Believe it or not, JB and others have shown that GR can be formulated in Platonia as is, and that Mach's principles are totally built into the fabric of GR (a fact that would have pleased Einstein). He even quotes results of others showing that GR is in a sense timeless despite earnest attempts to incorporate time into it.<br /><br />JB has technical papers on his website backing up these claims, but he also goes on to speculate what a cosmological theory would look like.<br /><br />By the way, he supports something like the \\"no collapse\\" view of Everett, but points out a serious flaw in Everett's view. In fact he points out a lot of things and is worth reading if only for that.<br /><br />I would now like to add my own two cents worth.<br />Quantum Field theory is normally presented as if it lived in Minkowski space time, but it really doesn't. Consider the following:<br /><br />1) A Fermion (e.g. an electron) must rotate twice (720 degrees) before it returns to its original state.<br /><br />2) Feynman's virtual particles exist outside the light cone.<br /><br />3) Feynman's method of summing over histories has a distinct \\"out of time\\" flavor to it. True it does tell how a particle can move from one place at one time to another place at another time, but the process takes place out of time. JB says (private communication) that it may be possible to model the Feynman propagator in Platonia.which there is no time.

B000002J0P|5.0|Scanning my radio while driving on a perfect Southern California Sunday afternoon today, I caught the first bars of Suite: Judy Blue Eyes.  Now, I've probably only heard this tune about 30,000 times over the past 40+ years but it is getting much more rare a find on contemporary radio stations.  Once again this Steve Stills masterwork just wrapped me up and helped make my day.  Of course, the whole album is one of the best ever produced but it remains this one extraordinary song that stands out above the others.  Stills did a lot of great work with Buffalo Springfield, CSNY and solo but his muse was working over-time when he created Suite: Judy Blue Eyes.  Just had to share the joy!
B003Y5H54W|5.0|I just came back from the theater and I loved it! Cinematography, sets, all fantastic.  Storyline unique in that it blends the traditional fairytale, a few elements from the earlier and wonderful \\"The Company of Wolves\\", and brings it to a more mature audience with a twist. Who done it? Who is the big bad wolf?  The movie is fast paced, intricate, cleverly drawing on relationships both new and old, thwarted love, etc. all in a picturesque Grimm-like village and cottages that you are just dying to live in!  Well, if you stay in this neighbourhood, that might be arranged! Far from predictable you will be finding yourself switching gears over a dozen times trying to figure it out. And the ending?  My what sharp teeth you have!  Enjoy as I did!  A must see for any fan of fairytales and fantasy movies, or if you are a fan of Tim Burton, for it isn't too far from his style!  Now I can't wait for the DVD and hope a soundtrack comes. I love the music from the festival!
0811874192|5.0|I love pop-up books and am always adding to my collection. When I came across this book on Amazon, I decided to purchase one as a gift for someone special. She was delighted to receive it! I actually watched her expression as she opened the book, and then her expressions of delight as she flipped through the pages - that alone was worth the price!<br /><br />There are five gorgeous pop-up bouquets in this book, true masterpieces and a reflection of quality paper engineering. There is a bouquet of spring flowers; an array of bright, tropical flowers; a floating lotus garden; a vase of lilies in vivid hues; and, a delightful bunch of roses. The colors are in turns vibrant and muted, and the paper engineering is amazing. The book can be opened to any one of the bouquets and set upon a desk or any even top to be displayed as a beautiful arrangement. I intend on getting one for myself and giving many more to friends as gifts!
1439102724|3.0|I am a huge Jodi Picoult fan, and have read every book she has written. Each one has been amazing in its own way. So, when I heard that Sing You Home was coming out, I jumped at the chance to pay WalMart extra money, rather than wait a few days and order it online.     The majority of the book was great. I have always appreciated Jodi Picoults' writing style, and love the topics that she chooses for her books - I have learned so much from the stories she has written.     I cried while reading this book, always a sign to me that this is a great story and well written.    HOWEVER, I was extremely disappointed in the ending. I felt like there were loose ends. Characters were suddenly dropped - huge changes happened in the last chapter that were never discussed. There was such potential to continue the story before wrapping it up. No, the pregnancy and birth did not need to be covered in detail. But, it would have been great to have the loose ends tied up.     If you can't handle a story that jumps around towards the end and doesn't answer major questions about what happened to charaters, this particular Jodi Picoult book may not be for you. I haven't had this problem with any of her other books, so I was quite surprised when I read this book and put it down feeling confused and sadden by the lack of follow through at the end.
B0017TYPIG|5.0|Great movie history...........You young brats should be so lucky to have one this good made in your lifetime.  Good Luck with that !
B003L1ZWG2|5.0|This movie was so intense.  It is scary in a very real way.  It was great, as it did what it set out to do - scare you, in an uneasy way.  After I watched it, I had to watch something more uplifting, just so I wouldn't keep thinking about it all night.  It gives you that nervous tension knot in your stomach, as you imagine yourself being in a similarly harrowing predicament - even if you never go skiing.
B004I2K4E8|1.0|if I could give less than one star, I would have. What was Cameron Macintosh thinking?    I suggest you watch the 25 th anniversary concert on PBS, as they're airing it this month, or view excerpts on YouTube .  It was horrific . I was so dissapointed. I've seen the production on broadway several times, and in Boston, and also own both the DVD and CD of the Les Miserable 10th anniversary concert, which was superb with an extraordinary cast.    In general I realize no two casts are exact. That is the beauty of broadway , to hear many talented voices.  But this 25th Anniversary version is so mediocre. I could not believe it. And Nick Jonas as Marius. What a disaster.  He has no voice for the stage at all. And I was embarrased for the poor kid, honestly I was. But overall the cast was just fair, at best, except for the Thenardiers, The Bishop, Gavroche, Even Lea Salonga who had played a fabulous Eponine in the 10th anniversary concert, was not suited at all  to play Fantine. Wrong vocal range , and she was struggling.     I can't believe , that for a climactic event such as this for  this production, how poorly the casting and how below average the talent was. Check out YouTube first, and try to watch excerpts from the 10th anniversary show . You will likely want that version.  Even if I only ever saw this 25th Anniversary version, I wouldn't have bought it, nor be inclined to see it repeatedly at the theatre.  There were way too many wrongs about this version. One or two great performances . But that's it. A big bummer !
B000002GJ7|5.0|I love this CD it lives in my 5 disc changer (so does their 1st album.)  Besides the great and creative music this is recorded really well, I have some very good DIY stereo equipment (speakers are JBL 4340 clones with even better parts) and those nasty CDs (like early Rush) are just painful to listen to.  This CD I can and often do flat out CRANK and enjoy.  Listening to it right now.  I really want the LP of this - not spending $40 to get one unless I have to (Not gonna do it!)
0756404738|5.0|*Warning - possible spoilers*<br /><br />Rothfuss had me waiting with bated breath for The Wise Man's Fear, and it did not disappoint. It was every bit as good as NotW, though it was not the same book; the prose was tighter and the plot more significant. It was a joy to read. Quite literally, actually, as it was also funnier by a long shot.<br /><br />That said, a few highly rated reviews criticize WMF for being long-winded and anti-climactic. \\"We don't learn anything really new,\\" they say. \\"Day 3 is going to have to contain 85% of the action to make up for it!\\"<br /><br />I don't feel that way at all. Thinking back, more progress is made in this book than NotW by a long-shot, detailing Kvothe's transformation from a boy into a man. If a lack of progress is being claimed, I'd like to simply point to the breadth the plot line covered: the University, Vintas, the bandits, Felurian, Ademre, and back again. Sounds like progress to me.<br /><br />I can hardly wait for Day 3. Here's to hoping it won't take another four years!<br /><br />As an aside -- is anyone else entertaining the notion that the series will be extended after Day 3? It could hardly end on Kvothe falling asleep an innkeeper...
B004HD2ZIQ|5.0|When I bought this CD I did not know what to expect when I heard it.  But once I listened to it, I was blown away.  Having a fan of Motorhead's for many years, this new entry to their 35 year history is just great.  No signs of old age with this band.  Lemmy has never sounded better, Philip Campbell is great on the guitar on all the songs and Mickey Dee is one fabulous drummer.  There are no ballads on this album, it's all rock 'n' roll at his best.  All the tunes are great and stand up right there with the classic song \\"Ace of Spades\\" from way back when.  The world is Yours is truly rock 'n' roll at his best.  I can't wait to see Lemmy and the boys someday live.  If you are a fan or someone who is just looking for a great rock CD get this CD.  Download or buy it, it's that good.
0307454541|4.0|Great book if you can get into it.  I was warned that the first 100 pgs are a hard read and I must agree.  Stick it out - the story is worth it.
1401216676|5.0|The killing Joke is a graphic novel that is not recommended for children or teens.  It is for mature personnel.  It is the story of Joker escping from Arlayn Asylum and sets his sights on kidnapping Commissioner Gordon and driving him mad by shooting his daughter Barbara aka Batgirl.  It is also the origin of Joker and tells how he got the way he is.  If you love the Baman series and want to find out the origins of Joker and Oracle, this is the book to get.  You find out why Joker is the most bizzare of all of Batman's villans that he has to deal with.  I read this book in one sitting and loved it through and through.  If you like finding out about the origins of Joker and Oracle, this is the bool to get.  You will not be dissappointed.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|Alot of people didn't like it from some of the cliche' characters and very little story line to the movie but lets be honest, its an alien invasion...how much story  do you really want from it? its fun its intense and its action packed! the special effects are fantastic and aaron eckhart does a great job acting. its not a movie the entire world will love its got its flaws but if you just want to watch a fun movie i recommend it

0240816250|5.0|This is clearly not a book written for beginners.  There are plenty of books for beginners with how-to and step-by-step instructions.  However; once one graduates from such books, one is hard pressed to find anything that takes him/her further.  Sporadic information are available in books and internet but nothing concise that presents these information in relevant manner.  This book does just that.    Please note, this books is all about film photography.  Digital photography is mentioned but only in relation to analog photography.  If you are not interested in film, this is not a book for you!    Way beyond monochrome is written in a format of college textbooks for advanced scientific/engineering fields.  It starts out slowly but soon, pages are filled with advanced topics and discussions, charts, graphs, and formulas.  One can comprehend the topic but good understanding in early college level mathematics help immensely.  Some chapters are independent and some flows into more advanced methods/topics in following chapters - very much like college textbooks.    This book is unusual in a way that while it is a book for art, photographic art, but the approach is very scientific.  When many photography books might say something is a \\"bit darker\\", in this book, it is said 1/3EV darker, for example.  Elsewhere, author shows what 1/3 EV difference looks like in prints, explains 1/3EV is understood to be a \\"significant change\\" and how much change in contrast and exposure is needed to achieve this change.  In fact, there are charts and formulas to explain how this all comes together.  For someone (like me) who struggled to achieve consistent change in various timing and contrast scenario, understanding on how to do this precisely - every time - without endless trials and errors - is beyond wonderful.    If I were to criticize this book, I think, a bit less (not much less, please) scientific approach may be appropriate - especially considering this is a book about photographic art. It may broaden the audience a bit that those who approach photography from right side of his/her brain may appreciate the content more.  I am leaving 5 stars as author's approach works for me very well.    I'd recommend this book to anyone who spent a year or more in darkroom and want to advance his/her skills.      Full disclosure:  I am casually acquainted with the author via an online community of analog photographers.
B003Q6D282|3.0|I love this series but even I have my limit. I noticed that when they attempted to put this movie from its 3D version into the Blue Ray format I thought the red color looked a little odd and tended to bother me. Maybe it was just my copy I am not sure. Like, I said I love this series but I felt this one was just and endless series of ways to torture people with a lame story. Lets end this series.
B003EMFC04|5.0|This is a really good Sherlock Holmes. I have seen several and each has their own flare. Robert & Jude bring a new vibe to the characters and the movie is very well done. I would recommend it.
B003Y5H4SO|4.0|I originally went to see this movie at the theater, not expecting much. To my surprise this is a pretty intense movie, well worth watching. Its allot better than some of the horror movies being produced lately. It actually has a fairly decent story line. I love the ending.
0756405890|3.0|I enjoyed every minute of reading this book. The characters, the plot, everything. But, somehow by the end I was left feeling like there was something missing from the book. I can't say for certain what, and the very abrupt ending didn't help. But that said, I would still recommend reading this book.
B002ZG98C8|1.0|I love the main actor Danny Treo, but this movie is just CAMPY. I was very disappointed. Why would anyone hire Lindsey Lohann she is an idiot and their are way sexier young hot female actresses, who could have done her role. I liked Cheech Maron as the priest, the best part of the movie. I am happy Cheech is still doing some roles. I also thought Michele Rodriguez was pretty cool as She. But I thought Jessica Alba's character stunk. She didn't fit at all in this movie. I would have had Michele Rodriguez play that part. Jessica is not tough and gritty enough for this kind of movie. Don't get mad at me Danny you are a great talent but this film needed more Machete and less Jessica. Also get rid of Jeff Fahee he is a washed out second stringer.
B000002U8G|5.0|This is my favorite Pink Floyd album. There, I said it. I went that far. I bought this CD second-hand when I was 15, along with half a dozen other Pink Floyd and Roger Water´s CDs, and I gave them all a fair chance, since I knew nothing of the band (I think they were \\"More\\", \\"Animals\\", \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\", \\"Amused to Death\\", \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" and \\"Sourceful of Secrets\\".  The other CDs were played from time to time, just because I wanted to find something great in them, but it turns out that only Meddle kept going back frequently to my discman. I couldn´t decide what I enjoyed more, the collection of mellow songs from the first side, all very tight, or the long, dreamy suite, tempered with the dazzling melody line.   I later got acquainted with Dark Side and The Wall, and my admiration for the band only grew. I agree that their best individual track is Wish You Were Here. But I never understood why I am maybe the single soul to put like this album above all others. My family keeps on playing Pulse or trying to make me like Roger Water´s solo career. But I am happy listening to San Tropez and Echoes over and over again.    That said, the cover is lousy.
B0041KKYCY|5.0|This movie is so gritty, after you watch this you might need to take a shower. Not for the squeamish. I though this version was miles ahead of the first film. I am not recommending this for most viewers only fans of the super hardcore blood bath modern horror.

B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|What can I say. A phenomenal first season. I haven't seen a horror TV show this intense ever. I love the comic books. I was hooked from the first issue. This is Zombie genre at its best. I think this show will be a cult classic. If you love Zombies or horror this is a must. I highly recommend this set. I cant wait until fall of 2011 for a full season. This only thing i hate about this set is they didn't give us enough episodes. I am excited to see how they will be doing Michone my favorite character. Also thank god they didn't hold back on the shock factor, they you AMC!
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|Just works as advertised. I had before a displayport to DVI cable and a DVI to HDMI and analog audio. Now I have one cable for all, but the best thing is that I have now digital audio 7.1 out. Before I couldn't hear the movie effects hardly (I always thought the THX setting on my receiver was a rip-off, but now it is loud and clear.  Btw: I bought in the Netherlands another little converter cable with the same functionality for my 2nd Macbook and that worked as well. It was even a bit smaller. For the Dutch: the Bijenkorf sells them.
B0047WJ12K|3.0|First off, I have to say that this movie is visually stunning.  I only watched it on my laptop, so I can't even imagine how awesome it would look on my flat screen.  That being said, I found the whole movie to be confusing, and at times, completely unrealistic and ludicrous.  Before anyone rips my head off, let me explain.  The plot was so complicated, and all over the place, that I found it hard to understand exactly what was going on.  And I can understand that this is a sci-fi movie at heart, and I love sci-fi movies, but the entire premise is so far out there (i'm talking thousands and thousands of years to even come close to what these characters are doing), that I had a hard time getting into the movie.  It is just downright impossible for someone to insert themselves into someone else's brain, and I dare say it always will be impossible.  And if it is possible one day, I doubt all it will take is to pop some ambien and connect to each other with an electrode.<br /><br />Even though the plot was basically ridiculous, I can see why the movie was such a hit.  Visually it is incredible.  And I think a lot of the plot was introduced solely for the purpose of \\"look what I can do!\\"  The characters float around, walk up walls, fall from high-rises, you name it.  You could say that this is what \\"The Matrix\\" would have been if you switch computers for dreams.<br /><br />I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it.  And if you haven't seen it, it is definitely worth a look.  I would also advise you to watch it alone, or at least with someone who doesn't talk during movies, at a time when you won't be interrupted.  This might have been my problem with the complexity of the plot, I was watching it at work, and had to pause it frequently to help customers.  I will definitely watch it again at a better time.
B000094HMU|5.0|I was so pleased I found this item. Thank you Amazon!!! This is a beautiful opera that my whole family enjoyed. The dvd was new and it is subtitled in various different languages, including English. Eva Marton, Placido Domingo, and the 1988 Metropolitan Opera cast were absolutley wonderful. The costumes and set design were amazing, too. I recommend this item to anyone.
B0043RSJ8G|4.0|I don't have much more to add to the thoughtful reviews already posted (I don't agree that she was unfair to either Christians or to gays) and agree with much of what has been said, particularly by those rating the book a 3 or 4.  While the storyline was absolutely fascinating, and realistic, the execution left a whole lot to be desired. Namely, I think she RUSHED too much about the storyline and the characters.  While each character seemed to be fairly well developed, their relationships were a lot less so.  I agree with what others have said about the Max/Zoe relationship in particular. There could have been a lot more done with why it ended as it did so abruptly. It just seemed to come out of nowhere. Also, thee ending was incredibly rushed. It seemed like she just wanted a quick exit. I was not satisfied at all at the end, which required some of the characters to make abrupt turnabouts, even though I applauded the result.  I had never read a book by Picoult and only read this one because of my interest in the subject matter.  I will know go and read some of her other books. I can tell she is a major talent!
0385341679|5.0|My eyes like to bug out when I saw the size of this book.  Not because I'm not use to reading large books, but because every other one in the series was small.  It all made sense once I started reading.  There was so much to tie up.  So many unanswered questions.  Plus, many more introduced in this series. The reader learns who/what/why about Jericho.  They learn who the fourth horseman was that raped Mac.  They learn about Mac's past.  They learn about the fae realm.  I could go on and on.  Most importantly is that Moning knited the yarns of each problem, each question so neatly, so perfectly together.  There were no seams showing.  Like another reviewer, I, too, cried early on in the story.  Moning's description of emotions and feelings was overpowering.  To make a fantasy so real that it touches the reader is a sign of a truly extraordinary storyteller.  I'm sorry that this series has come to an end.  I look forward to what Moning will introduce to us next.<br /><br />As another reviewer mentioned, there is no way to describe this book without spoiling the story.  Suffice it to say that there were many characters that I had no clue what part they played in the story until the end.  I was so surprised that I did not see it before, but it was not something that was just slapped on in the end.  Moning built it up from the first book, but made it so subtle that it did not become obvious until the end. I read so much that it is hard to catch me unawares.  I love the fact that she was able to surprise me.<br /><br />For any new readers, you would need to start with the first book and read in order.  Otherwise you wouldn't get the story and growth of characters.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I have always enjoyed Bruce Willis' smart aleck persona, and this movie, \\"Red\\" shows Bruce at his best. As a retired member of a CIA black ops team, he obviously has deadly skills, but when it comes to dealing with dating, he's as shy as a little kid.     The other retired characters are played with marvelous abandon by John Malkovich,as a skillful but very paranoid ex-op. Morgan Freeman is a not quite helpless nursing home resident. Helen Mirren is an elegant Martha Stewart wanna-be with a penchant for taking on the occasional \\"hit\\" out of sheer boredom. Brian Cox, an ex Russian spy called on to help the team, is charming as a man with more romance than mayhem on his mind.    The acting skills of the two other main characters aren't overwhelmed by the blatant over the top acting of the above group. Mary-Louise Parker holds her own and more as the romance novel buff whose dull life and job are interrupted when she finally meets Frank (Bruce). Karl Urban is the unlucky CIA agent who has to \\"deal\\" with that over the hill bunch. He does a great job walking a fine line, in that he doesn't come off as a bad guy.    Richard Dreyfuss in an almost cameo role is as smarmy as you can get playing a very weaselly bad guy. Last but not least; Ernest Borgnine plays the keeper of the secrets, both edited and unedited.    This movie is sheer adventure with a lot of laughter thrown in. The one liners fly so often that the movie really needs to be seen more than once to catch them all. Sometimes just the expressions on Malkovich's face are enough to crack you up. Suffice it to say that these people aren't your normal Social Security pensioners.

0062515675|1.0|I should have known better. This book was recommended by someone who doesn't like to read and doesn't read. He told me it changed his life and so I ordered this at a heartbeat. If you have done much reading on self help, this book is just a repeat of what everyone has written before. Except it is told in a story format in an awkward manner.  It is bad enough that I have an urge to write my very first review. I suppose if a reader has not been exposed to this type of subject it might be a good introduction, however, for most, do not waste your money.

B004B32532|5.0|Santa Sangre (Saint Blood) another film by visionary writer / director Alejandro Jodorowsky who also acted & directed El Topo and The Holy Mountain , I saw El Topo and The Holy Mountain on Video Years ago , didn't mind El Topo but didn't think much of The Holy Mountain back than so may watch it again as for Santa Sangre never saw it till now on Blu Ray even better and just to give some of you readers an idea what this movie is about a young circus performer , deaf and mute girlfriend who's mother is the tattooed woman who has an affair with the knife thrower , the father of the young circus performer & his wife catches them on the act , the mother of the young circus performer enrage with what she has seen throws acid on his privates and he takes revenge on her by amputating both her arms , the crime of passion that shatters his soul and the macabre journey back to the world of his armless mother , deaf mute lover and murder , starring Axel  Jodorowsky , Blanca Guerra and Guy Stockwell who appeared in 30 movies and 200 television shows star in this epic surreal movie fully restored and featuring more than 5 hours of extras a Well Recorded Blu Ray with a Good Clear Picture but wasn't the best sounding Blu Ray I've heard only English 2 Channel Stereo & Italian Stereo and Spanish Mono than again this movie was filmed in 89 & from especial feautures and interviews I like Alejandro Jodorowsky's attitude and sense of humor ,  maybe weird and bizarre in some ways but a Good Psychological Thriller .
B004PA50JM|5.0|5/5 is not high enough to rate this album. What an amazing job Buck, Mills, and Stipe did on this recording, what a beautiful compilation of lyrics and music. I have been a fan since the mid 80's, and though the last couple albums may have not have been their strongest, this one is outstanding, and what a cast of background vocals they have brought with them to make this album even more amazing. I have listened to this album over 100 times since I bought it this week, I just can not get enough of it,  The part of this album that does sadden me though, is as this is R.E.M.'s 15th album, one day they will stop making such beautiful music, and we will be left to scrounge the internet for bootlegs and rarities. Good Job.....P.S. Athens Rules
0307454541|4.0|The book has been out awhile, the movie has come and gone from theaters, yet somehow, I  managed to avoid reviews and spoilers, so I tackled the book without a clue as to the plot.  I didn't even know why the novel was called the Millenium series.  Silly me, I thought it was because the story occurred around the year 2000.<br /><br />The first few chapters were dense with detail, too much back story, and unexpected shifts in point of narration.  If there hadn't been so much hype surrounding the novel, I might have put the book down.  Thank goodness the popularity of the tale kept me turning the page.  Once the mystery of the Harriet, the missing and presumed dead girl, began to unfold I was hooked.<br /><br />Larsson's strength is in plotting.  A few key twists were predictable enough, yet there were enough subplots woven into the main arc to keep my interest.  Larsson also tosses around a few red herrings to keep the reader guessing \\"who done it.\\"  While I didn't particularly care for Mikael Blomkvist's character, I adored the tragic, yet spunky, Lisbeth Salander.  The ending brought about a satisfying conclusion, something that I find rare these days.  So what book did I pick up to read next?  Yep, the second book in the trilogy, The Girl Who Played with Fire.  So far, I like this book better than the first.<br /><br />It is a pity Larsson died before the books achieved their height of popularity.  I am, however, happy that the publishers changed the title from Men Who Hate Women.  I would have had about zero interest in picking up a book with that label on the front cover and I would have missed out on a good read.<br /><br />This book review first appeared on writers on the journey blog:<br /><br />[...]
0393338827|4.0|This is the first book I have read by Michael Lewis and I intend to read others. I both liked it and could not stand it. There were way too many uses of the f-word and I could see no reason for this use, even assuming the characters he quoted were so fond of them as he appeared to be. All of these people, men and women, spoke in this fashion? I doubt it and it spoiled my enjoyment of the book.  I don't know if Lewis were tryimg to place blame or merely showing there were very few people, and those people were essentially unknowns, who could see the weakness of the mortgage bond market. And now I must depart from the book and say what I wish the book had been about. Who changed bonds to financial instruments? Was this a common praactice, perhaps used routinely with other types of bonds?  On page 254 of my book Lewis mentions a name, Andy Stone, working for Credit Suisse in the year 2000 and creating the first CDO with mortgage backing, the collateralized debt obligation. Here is the intersting story I wish had been told. Who was Andy Stone, what was his postion at the bank, why did he create the CDO, what was his thinking? Next, who approved it and how was its use disseminated? What created its popularity, (we know this, Michael Lewis did tell us, but I would like to see it related to the rise in volume). Then there are other things to know.  Certainly the ratings firms must have used mathematicians in their ranks in setting ratings, those mathematicians strong in probability. However they musy have been the pure mathematicians, not applied, those with the training that gave them the probability functions, but little else. Did the people seeking ratings for their instruments know this weakness and know they could work on using the wrong assumptions that the mathematicians needed to feed these functions? If the incomes of one group of mortgage holders bears the same relationship as another group, their likelihood of default should be about equal, lacking some other different factor. In the U.S. the backgrounds should be similar, hence the ratings are similar, the ratio of income to loan value was the concealed variable. I sure would like to know how these CDO's were presented to Moody's, S.& P., and any other rating firm used.  The glimpses into the characters betting against these CDO's was well done, brief glimpses but important aspects were well portrayed, so well in fact I can not understand why they were not better listened to, especially Greg Lippmann of Deutsche Bank. However I think most, if not all of us, have 20/20 hindsight and, as I read the book, I tried to put myself in a customer position with each trader mentioned and tried to decide if I would believe one or the other. I tried to be honest and I must admit I do not know. Lewis was way too far on the knowing side, did all of the buyers hear any of the contrarians? The book is now outdated but it stands as an example, we still need better oversight on our financial ventures, there are still vultures out there looking to spot loopholes in our rules. Lewis points this out obliquely, but powerfully.
0399536108|1.0|I was excited about this book and felt optimistic after reading through the reviews, however, a disappointment  was soon to follow. There is a substantial mount of filler and very little actual content involved here. In addition to a mildly condescending tone in which it was written, the pages there in will only serve as a reminder in common sense. If you have ever thought about living an unconventional life than most of what you will read has already been on your radar or occurred to you at some point. Flip through this one in the book store if you must, and you will find that that is enough.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|If you want to know why you should upgrade your equipment so you can play Blu-Ray discs, all you have to do is watch this film on a Blu-Ray player and an HD TV.  It's stupendous.  My ONLY disappointment is in the fact I wanted to purchase the 3D version of Avatar but it's not out yet!
B0001HAISG|5.0|Beautifully made, like turning the pages of an illustrated story book.  Amazing visual effects too.  The actors do a wonderful job, children especially.  While this is not a musical, it has great music too.      Great family entertainment. I highly recommend it.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I have always wanted to go and see Burlesque at the cinema but never got round to seeing it, unfortunately. As it had received really good movie reviews and won a Golden Globe award for best song from a motion picture, which was written by Diane Warren and sung brilliantly by Legend that is Cher.     I knew it was going to be good because it had American/latina singer Christina Aguilera, who does her big-screen debut,also starring Cher, Cam Gigandet from Twilight, and Stanley Tucci from The Devil Wears Prada.     Burlesque tells the story of a small-town girl with a big voice from Iowa called Ali, played superbly by Christina Aguilera, who gets on a bus and follows her dream of becoming a singer to LA. She finds the Burlesque club where she meets the very attractive bartender, Jack, played by Cam Gigandet and tells her where to meet the club's boss Tess, played by Cher. Ali meets the bitchy Nikki, played by Kristen Bell, who makes her life hell. Sean is Tess's best friend played by Stanley Tucci. Ali meet a very handsome man who wants to buy the club from Tess called Marcus played by Eric Dane. She is charmed by his millions and his talk. But she finds herself falling for her friend and roommate and bartender, Jack, when they spend more time together at the club when Ali lands herself a job there as a waitress and then lets everyone know she has a voice. A VERY BIG VOICE. And soon Ali and her voice is Burlesque's attraction bringing in more customers than ever before. Ali and Jack fall in love and end up spending the night together until his fiancee, Natalie, from New York, arrives back, and all hell breaks loose. Anyway, Ali and Tess manage to keep the club from selling to Marcus who wants to turn it into houses. Jack tells Ali how sorry he is and that he ended it with Natalie and that he loves her and she forgives him. So they live happily ever after.    I was completely mesmorised by both Christina Aguilera and Cher's vocal and acting abilities. Considering thiswas Aguilera's debut movie, she was absolutely spectacular in singing and in acting. You would think she had been into acting for years not starting out. All the actors were great. Kristen Bell was great as bitchy and jealous Nikki who dyed her hair from blonde to a brunette for the part. Burlesque had spectacular and mesmorising musical numbers sung by Aguilera and Cher like \\"You Haven't Seen the Last of Me\\", \\"Something's got a Hold on Me\\", \\"A Guy That Takes His Time\\", \\"Bound To You\\", written by Aguilera. And \\"But I am a good girl,\\" and many more.    Burlesque is a real feel good, girl flick but can also be enjoyed watching by everyone. If people like musicals, romance and drama, then this film is for you. See it now! YOu'll LOVE IT!
1936594234|5.0|This book assisted me to fully appreciate a lot of what I already knew. Yet had forgotten to apply as I, like so many, get caught up in the anxiety and stress of every day life. It is about becoming aware that we can sabotage our lives by our own erroneous thoughts and beliefs.  The fact that our circumstances are our own doing. We need to learn we can't change a thing by attempting to change our environment, we must change the cause of the problem then the environment automatically changes.<br />We sell ourselves short,we beat ourselves up with negative self talk which our subconscious mind takes very seriously. Expect the best and our subconscious mind will make it happen.<br />I loved the humble and easy style of the writer.  I enjoyed the examples of true life experiences which brought clarification and meaning to what the writer was conveying.<br />Thank you Joseph Murphy. I look forward to other books you have written.
B002FL3JA0|2.0|As an owner of the print versions of these books, and having scanned pages of my own copies to use them on my iPad on gigs, I'm more than familiar with how a good e-book should work for a musician.    Here's the good news:  - The type and music image is large, clear and easy to read.  - There's a real Table of Contents in the front: you find the tune, click the link and you're there.  - The page turns are fast (especially using the Kindle Reader on the iPad - I wouldn't bother to use these on a Kindle on a gig: not viewable enough for me.    Here's the bad news:Every page is followed by a copyright page. If a tune is 1 page long, it'll consist of the tune page and a copyright page; if it's a 2 page long tune (such as Eiderdown) it'll be 4 pages (2 tune pages, 2 copyright pages).    I suspect that when the first scanned these books for the Kindle, they saw that the tune would be small ('cause the copyright is at the bottom). So rather than shrink the copyright, they adjusted the scanning to push the copyright off to the next page.    This may not bother you  - in which case you'll find that the Kindle versions are faithful e-book versions of the print editions. (I'll leave the arguments of comparing the legal 6th Editions of Real Books to their predecessors to others: the errors - or \\"corrections\\" - introduced in the 6th edition are well known among Real Book musicians.)    But you should download the samples first and decide if this will be a problem BEFORE buying the books.    PS--found this out 2 days after writing my review: the Copyright notice causes another problem. The Kindle Reader does a really good job breaking a book into two pages when you turn an iPad sideways (landscape mode). That should mean we'd get to see 2-page tunes with both pages displayed at once - not with these Real Books. Instead, the copyright notice fills the 2nd page.    Hal Leonard should be ashamed; and those guys are supposed to be well-respected.
B002ZG976U|4.0|Going into the movie you just know the formula and fortunately for the viewer it delivers.  Christina has the right pipes to deliver and Cher is her usual stunning self, albeit with slightly more lips.  The persona of the club, the owner's love of the culture that make up dying breeds, the competition for attention from the dancers all add up to an engaging movie that leaves you wanting it to go on.    Even at the start its hard to believe Christina could be just a waitress and then the adventure begins.  One of chasing your dreams and letting it go.  Overall a very satisfying experience that leads one to dream, and want to visit the Beall and Bourbon streets of the world to drink in all that we were and can still be.
0525951652|5.0|Being a huge Ken Follett fan I bought the book as soon as it came out.  I was enthralled from page one till the end.  He did not disappoint me in the least with this book.  I am not a history fan so I could care less if it is historically accurate or whether it is complete BS; matters not to me.  I simply enjoy the twists, the characters and the anticipation of what will happen next.  My only fear is that it'll take Ken 5 years to produce the sequal and being kind of an idiot, I would have to reread this novel. But fear not, I will do whatever I have to do.
B004L3AR0K|3.0|To call this 2010 romantic dramedy uneven would be a severe understatement. It suffers from downright ADD as it moves from a snapshot of manic arrested development to pharmaceutical satire to near-porn to romantic comedy to medical melodrama. That the film was directed by Edward Zwick ([[ASIN:0800177967 Glory]]) suddenly makes sense when you think about how he and fellow producer Marshall Hersokowitz created a similarly toned TV series, [[ASIN:B001U9BS2O thirtysomething]], back in the late eighties. Both of them also co-wrote the screenplay along with Charles Randolph based on James Reidy's 2005 book, [[ASIN:B002QGSVF2 Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman]]. However, what works over several TV seasons doesn't work as well within a 112-minute running time. Fortunately, Zwick chose two attractive leads, Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway, to star in this basically schizophrenic movie, and both perform admirably under the circumstances.<br /><br />Beginning in 1996, the plot revolves around Jamie Randall, a young medical school drop-out just fired from a sales job at an electronics store. A typical commitment-phobe, he manages to land a job through his younger brother Josh, an obnoxiously wealthy dot-commer, as a pharmaceutical rep for Pfizer selling Zoloft and eventually Viagra. While accompanying an influential doctor on his rounds, Jamie meets Maggie Murdock, a pretty free spirit with early onset Parkinson's disease. They waste little time in having sex, an arrangement that suits both their situations and libidos. However, it's inevitable that one wants more out of the relationship, and Jamie convinces Maggie to take it to the next level. At a Parkinson's convention in Chicago, they come away with a more palpable sense of what the long-term effects of the disease will be on Maggie. This naturally tests their relationship as they face the prospect of her condition worsening.<br /><br />More at home than as the [[ASIN:B003UYUQZW Prince of Persia]] in the sixth century B.C., Gyllenhaal takes on a George Clooney-type role in Jamie with convincing self-assurance. Perhaps because [[ASIN:B00006L948 The Princess Diaries]] will never entirely leave her screen persona (note her recent Oscar gig as evidence of her cheerleading tendencies), Hathaway does surprisingly well portraying a sexual hedonist keeping a deliberate emotional distance from everybody. The two banter sharply and handle their characters' sexual combustion with &eacute;lan. When the film threatens to move into [[ASIN:B00003CXV4 Sweet November]]-type melodrama, the actors avert the heart-tugging predictability with their emotional alertness. As the chubby younger brother, Josh Gad is as irritating as an evasive fly in an unessential role designed to provide intermittent comic relief but failing miserably in what amounts to a Jonah Hill impersonation.<br /><br />The other actors are fine but make mostly truncated appearances - Oliver Platt as a blustery Pfizer salesman, Hank Azaria as the seasoned go-between doctor, Gabriel Macht as a competing rep with anger management issues, George Segal and the late Jill Clayburgh as Jamie's concerned parents in an early and all-too-brief dining table scene. It's also worth noting that Steven Fierberg's sharp cinematography captures the various Midwest locations really well, and Steven Rosenblum's action-movie-style editing captures the manic energy Zwick appears to have wanted during the film's first half. The 2011 DVD/Blu-Ray offers relatively few extras - about seven minutes of deleted scenes, the original theatrical trailer, and four quick featurettes (\\"Love & Other Drugs\\": An Actor's Discussion\\", \\"Beautifully Complex: Anne Hathaway is Maggie\\", \\"Reformed Womanizer: Jake Gyllenhaal is Jamie\\",  and \\"Selling Love & Other Drugs\\" which features Reidy. Surprisingly, there is no education piece about Parkinson's disease, a missed opportunity.yllenhaal takes on a George Clooney-type role in Jamie with convincing self-assurance.

B003DZX3US|3.0|Everyone knows the story of Beauty and Beast, so there is not point writing a summary. So, I'll get to my greatest points. Moms, Dads, and whoever is buying this product for you sweet little angel stick with the tape. Yes the colors are beautiful when they should be bright. But the dimmer lights of the romantic evening should not have bells gown glowing brighter than a harvest moon. I felt like I needed sun glasses while watching the dance. Digital brightens and it's doesn't really darken correctly. This is because computers can only really recognize the bright colors with barely any shade in-between. You see this in digital photography. Your kid's shirt is not neon green but the image shows it such. Another thing key to animations is the lines and the fade away do to the brightness. Belle's dress just glows. There really isn't any lines to speak of.   Seriously,get out the VCR and buy the tape. The colors are so much better and real. You can see the lines and enjoy the movie as a piece of art instead of what looks like at time sloppy art work.
0803730470|5.0|This story is so cute.  My 4 1/2-year-old daughter and I read it nearly every day.  Even my 10-year-old niece said it was good.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|I originally thought \\"A child vampire? Done before, wasn't great.\\" This was actually better than I had expected which is always nice. It's a twist on the humanity of vampires (well what's left) and how finding that one person who understands and accepts you can be terrifying and beautiful, obviously for the plot line also a little gory lol. It also has a Romeo and Juliet kind of feel, kinda of. Not so much \\"horror\\" or \\"thriller\\" as it's a more of a \\"suspense\\" that sucks you in just enough to wanting to know what's next.<br /><br />The most unique piece for me was the take on what happens to a vampire when they are not invited in but come in anyway. Most writers just have vampires begging to come in and when the answer is a \\"No\\" it's like an invisible wall has stopped them so they just can't pass but this was good. Unique take and I really loved it. You'll see what I mean ;)
B0049P1ZZQ|4.0|This show is well made and engaging, it's only problem is that it only has six epispodes so it's like a british tv series. (many are only that long each season). But it doesn't stay very faithful to the spirit of the 'the walking dead' comic series and that's why it's very good.  The acting is excellent too and the effects are outstanding, the show and comics borrowed from many zombie movies particularily Romeros classics but that's ok too. This is high budget tv and it's got good stories and it's only the second tv series featuring zombies ever. The first was the outrageous \\"dead air' from the uk , which skewered 'big brother' and the desire for instand fame. I recommend that one too and this one looks great on blu ray. If you want to own this blu ray is the only way to go.
B004BBDHEK|4.0|\\"Truth of Touch\\" is Yanni's first studio album of mostly instrumental music since 2003's \\"Ethnicity\\".  This release is more \\"jazzy\\" in texture than usual giving it a slight twist from the normal, and is a vast improvement over his previous album \\"Mexicanisimo\\".  And although Yanni has lost nothing in regard to his incredible talent (granted he has gained equally little), this album should not disappoint in the least with Yanni's legion of devoted fans.  More great stuff from the musical master from Greece!  Keep it coming, Yanni!

0312323867|4.0|I enjoyed this book a great deal. It was quirkly and uniquely sequeled in a different character's perspective. I found the self-centered personality of the heroine trying on my nerves for the first hundred pages or so, but I had the same issues with the shopaholic series heroine as well. A good book, well written and fun. I love series books. I don't think it was as good as something borrowed, but so seldom are sequels better than their predecessors. I did not enter into this expecting it to be as good as the first therefore, I was not disappointed. A good read!!!

It's not that I was surprised by my top 5 strengths, it's that I didn't realize how unique I was to my team. The book is really more of a reference tool, and its the test that reveals your unique things that come naturally to you.

B004G5ZXVQ|4.0|I picked this album up for $9.99 at a local Best Buy, along with a vinyl copy of Abbey Road (which made someone's review comparing the two seem almost ironic!). I took them straight home to listen to. Once I started listening to this new REM, I thought, \\"Alright, good opening track...\\" But, each song would be better than the last! And by the end of the album, I wanted to hear it again immediately. That was thursday, this is sunday morning, and I bet I've listened to this album fifteen to twenty times already... Not consecutively, I've been mixing in other stuff, as always. But, I have been coming back to Collapse Into Now, which I think says something about the quality of this album! Of course, I've never listened to an REM album that left me thinking, \\"Wow, I'll never want to listen to this again...\\" Sure, some have been patchy and maybe even a little unfocused, but there's just something about the music REM makes and how they make it...<br /><br />I guess what it comes down to for me with each new release from any band I enjoy, is \\"Do I enjoy this??\\" and \\"Am I being entertained?\\" Those are the questions that come into play when listening to anyone's new album. Not \\"Does this trump or surpass one of their earlier releases??\\" or \\"Are they breaking some brand new ground with this new music??\\"<br /><br />Collapse Into Now : Another great REM release!
B003Y5H53S|5.0|This movie succeeds in so many ways I'm not even sure where to begin. First, the animation itself - that just keeps getting better as the CGI guys perfect their craft, and this rides the wave. Hair, feathers, and all kinds of delicate effects come across beautifully, in ways that couldn't have been done just a few years ago. But, even the best tools do nothing without an artist to wield them, and the characters here show real artistry. Each one has a unique look, from the cute \\"Little Sister\\" to the grizzled characters of the Western genre, to the dusty Mayor with his windup wheelchair.<br /><br />Taking it a step further, good looks and shallow characters leave a movie feeling oddly hollow, but these characters all come to life. Depp's mouthy lizard with the aloha shirt stars, of course, but each personality stands on its own. Then the scripting takes those individuals, and puts them to work in a demanding set of roles: the kind that stay true to the oater genre while satirizing it at every step. The sendup of the spaghetti western wouldn't have come across nearly as well if it weren't taken seriously, too. (The Clint Eastwood-like cameo was a high point.)<br /><br />Although the movie had plenty of kid appeal, there was plenty to keep the grownups entertained as well. In fact, a few jokes (like \\"side saddle\\") had me rolling, at the same time I was glad I didn't have a kid demanding an explanation. Rango has my highest recommendation.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviwing the release to theaters
1439102724|5.0|I think Jodi Picoult can make any topic seem interesting. A music therapist and frozen embryos?!?! Somehow, Jodi made this into a very interesting and well written book. Every time I read one of her books (all of them), I am amazed at her writing skill. This book is no different. I am not a professional reader/reviewer, I am just someone who loves to read. If you like Jodi's other books, you will enjoy this one just as much. Another good book, Jodi!
030014332X|5.0|An impressive six-week writing feat: The history of the world in 284 pages. E. H. Gombrich only had time to put down things that were boiled down to the essentials.  For example with regard to Muhammad:  \\"He told his followers that they must fight for his teaching...\\" and kill if necessary (no time to dicuss different kinds of Jihad) and  in the case of Christianity:  Jesus preached love.  There is only time to state the fundamental facts as he sees them.  In the American Civil War, he writes, The South was richer and more powerful than The North.  In this case, qualification, elaboration, or restatement was called for but you must keep in mind that the author was under  pressure to write seven pages everyday and had to produce something that at the end of just six weeks would make sense to young readers and would be accepted and enjoyed by a wider readership as well.

0312600844|4.0|I almost didn't download this book on my Kindle because of all the mixed reviews but I am very glad I did. I loved this book. I loved the characters and their lives. The dysfunction that seemed to rule the lives of the characters was what really made them seem like normal middle class people. This was a great story that is very easy to get engrossed in from the very beginning and you will be sorry when it's over!
0802473156|4.0|Normally, these types of books are ignored by me. I began reading this because it was on a shelf where I work, and it was something I just picked up and flipped through. This was enough to make me buy it, read it, and share it with my wife.<br /><br />Makes a lot of sense.<br /><br />Not a how-to guide, but an insight into how we work emotionally in our search for love, and how different people need to be loved in different ways and that it is in figuring out which way your loved one needs to be loved that will build a successful relationship.<br /><br />That, and the recognition that \\"love is a choice.\\"<br /><br />If you've ever thought about why you're not getting what you want out of your relationship, this book might help.
B0017APPSE|4.0|Despite numerous flaws, as pointed out by other reviewers here, I still enjoyed `The Other Boleyn Girl'.  The facts may not be spot on and various elements are left out or skimmed over, but having never read the book I found the film entertaining enough for what it is.<br /><br />This follows the Boleyn family and their ambitions to make themselves powerful in the court of England.  If that means the daughters sleeping with the King or manipulating him for their own ends, then so be it.  This shows Mary, the gentler of the sisters, as she is seduced by the King and Anne's more ruthless manipulations to get into this good books and the throne of England.  The girls Uncle is seen to be the mastermind behind all of the manipulations and the girls would have done better not to have listened to him so closely.<br /><br />I found the acting pretty good throughout and Johansson, Portman and Bana all give reasonable performances.  The father was a little wooden at times, but he isn't in the film enough to upset you too much.<br /><br />This is a reasonable historical drama and if you take the facts with a pinch of salt and enjoy it for what it is, then you should enjoy this just fine.  Of course if the book is as good as some others here say, and you've read that first, you may have a different view on this, but coming to this as a stand alone film, it kept me entertained well enough.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B004FGMV0W|5.0|Originality comes and goes and this album says it all. I reccomend this CD if you're a ballad and acoustic fan.

B00024I2Z4|4.0|Although highly formulaic, `Mulan' is one of the better Disney films of more recent years.<br /><br />Like `Pocahontas' this film has a female protagonist and she is as independent and free spirited. When the Huns invade China Mulan's father is called to fight, but due to his ill health Mulan sneaks away, disguises herself as a boy and learns to fight in his place. She is assisted along the way by one of her family guardians, a tiny red dragon (voiced by Eddie Murphy, before he became better known as the voice of Donkey in `Shrek').<br /><br />This film has some nice touches and is animated very well. The voice cast is very good and the music isn't too saccharine or cheesy either. You always know with a Disney film how the story will go, I.e. independent main character wants to find their own way in life, but family loyalty and immaturity holds them back, they go away and learn a lesson fighting an evil character of some description (usually assisted by a cute side-kick), find love and learn lessons and then they come home to a big happy ending family reunion. There may be slight deviations from this from film to film, but this is generally how they tend to go and it is a formula that works.<br /><br />All in all I enjoyed this film, maybe more so than the previously mentioned `Pocahontas', and whilst it was relatively short, it was entertaining for the duration.
044656740X|3.0|Some of the principles in this book are good, but many others are outdated.  The idea that either you own the shop or work in the shop is a good concept.  Using income to make income is great advice.  His points on real estate, however are likely oudated.  Give the book a read, but realize that some of its principles are from 10 to 20 years ago and the economic reality has long since changed.  For example, good debt vs. bad debt is an interesting and important concept.  However, many people and companies go broke not only from too much debt, but due to lack of cash flow.  An unexpected expense or loss of income destroys their house of cards.  In 2011, the healthy companies are very liquid (large cash reserves) and carry little or NO debt.  The housing crisis and the Great Recession may have permamently altered aspects of the American economy, which means that some aspects of this book are maybe obsolete; or at best, should be read with a skeptical eye.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|If you love Jane Austen, particularly Pride and Prejudice, and appreciate a bit of a modern twist, you will love this movie. The casting is excellent, the best of any version of Pride and Prejudice I've seen. It is total fantasy to think that a modern woman could actually find herself in the Pride and Prejudice story, and that is part of what makes it so much fun. The characters are full of surprises, yet true to the original story. I've watched it many times and still find it enjoyable, so it is well worth having in my library. Everyone I've recommended it to has also loved it. I bet you will too!
0316017922|5.0|What do the Beatles, elite Canadian hockey players, Bill Gates, and Robert Oppenheimer have in common?  They are all examples of outliers in Malcolm Gladwell's book.  His book's driving point is that genius is not the only, or even the most important thing; when determining a person's success in life.  Access to important experiences and resources during a person's earlier life is just as important.  To illustrate this claim, Gladwell discusses the story of Christopher Langan, a man who ended up working on a horse farm in rural Missouri despite having an IQ of 195 (Einstein's was 150).  Rural Missouri did not provide him the opportunity to fully express the possibilities of Langan's intelligence, so his overall success was limited.     In a similar train of thought, the author interviews Bill Gates, who says that unique access to a computer at a time when they were not commonplace helped him succeed.  In high school, Gates was able to log in 10,000 hours of time writing computer code.  Without this access, Gladwell states that Gates would still be \\"a highly intelligent, driven, charming person and a successful professional\\", but that he might not be worth US$50 billion.  The principle of the \\"10,000-Hour Rule\\" is a common theme that appears throughout Outliers.  The author argues that any expert has clocked at least 10,000 hours of time in his or her chosen field of expertise, whether it is the music, computers, or professional hockey.     While writing the book, Gladwell states that \\"the biggest misconception about success is that we do it solely on our smarts, ambition, hustle and hard work.\\"  In Outliers, he hopes to show that there are a lot more variables involved in an individual's success than society cares to admit, and he wants people to \\"move away from the notion that everything that happens to a person is up to that person\\".     Overall, this is a great book to read.  I personally liked it better than his other previous two books, Tipping Point and Blink.  This book will inspire you to explore your previous assumptions on what makes for a successful individual.

1400064287|5.0|Chip and Dan Heath's book can be boiled down to five central concepts: 1. Simplicity - to sell an idea it must be stripped to its core, and the most important concepts should jump out; 2. Unexpectedness - this new idea must destroy preconceived notions about something so people stop, think, and actually consider the idea; 3. Concreteness - avoid statistics, use real-world analogies to help people understand complex ideas; 4. Credibility - if you are not trusted, the information is nearly worthless; 4. Emotional - giving people good information only goes so far, you need an emotional appeal to really motivate peoplel; 5. Stores - people like hearing good stories, iit helps them connect to the information and gives it a human face.

B004B8DH98|2.0|I too was mislead in thinking this was more a thriller that what it turned out to be. Yet that wasn't the problem with the film. Nor was the slow pace, scenic cinematography, the symbolism, occasional subtitles, the full frontal nudity, the minimal action scenes, the acting, the problem at all. It was kinda like a \\"Lost in Translation\\" of hired assassins last job movies. The script is what ultimately leads you astray from potentially a good film into a semi-predictable ending with some head-scratching subplots. Clooney was great in his stoic demeanor aching to break free from his life and actually connect with someone for a change. The smoking hot Italian prostitute he eventually falls for is his lifeline out of the nomadic solitude he leads. Yet the film makers throw some incomprehensible and unexplained actions along his way and never give the audience a proper payoff.

B002ZG976U|4.0|I'm no expert on acting, but I'll tell the world it didn't take long at all for me to buy into Christina Aguilera as a small town girl aspiring to be a singer. And, yeah, I know the singing part isn't that far a stretch from Aguilera's wheelhouse. But as a first time actress, she also handles her business. So, take that, Mariah Carey.<br /><br />BURLESQUE doesn't climb the heights of CHICAGO, and the plot is a far cry from innovative. All the tropes and archetypes of a musical are here and you can check them off the list one by one. When Ali (Aguilera) quits her waitressing gig in Iowa and relocates to Los Angeles, the writing is already on the wall. In L.A., she sets foot in the Burlesque Lounge and falls in love with the nightclub and its glamorous disposition. She applies for a job as a dancer and is turned down by Tess, the proprietor of the establishment (Cher). But Ali demonstrates her spunk by picking up a tray and beginning to work the crowd as a waitress. At this stage, we're just counting down the clock until she finds her way to the mic. When she does, it's a pretty spectacular moment.<br /><br />And are you at all surprised to learn that Tess the owner is hanging on to the Burlesque Lounge by her fingernails? Mortgages are a bloody beyotch.<br /><br />The resident witchy diva (because there's always one in these suckers) is played by Kristen Bell, whom I loved as Veronica Mars. Bell's character, Nikki, is the only one who actually sings in the Burlesque Lounge; all the other performers lip synch to their music. Ali arrives at the really revolutionary notion of having the performers actually sing their songs, but she gets turned down flat by Tess. But then Tess hears Ali sing, and so cue the change of heart.<br /><br />There's the expected romance between roommates Aguilera and Cam Gigandet's dreamboat bartender, and these two are sweet together and give the film a chance to occasionally flirt with romantic comedy. You never really get a feeling that that shady real estate developer had a real shot at Ali. The best pairing, though, is Cher and the excellent Stanley Tucci who plays the good-humored back stage director and Tess's right hand man. I wouldn't at all be surprised if these two were improvising in some of their scenes, their chemistry feels that real and organic. Alan Cumming lurks here somewhere, and director Steven Antin remarks that Cumming was intended to be the Mad Hatter in this bit of Wonderland. If Cumming was meant to play the swishy stage presence, well, Tucci stole that thunder. Cumming is wasted in what basically is an extended cameo.<br /><br />The fishnets and feathers and boas are familiar props, but BURLESQUE evades the pitfalls that consumed rank stinkers like GLITTER and SHOWGIRLS. Partly, it's because Cher and Tucci's presence elevates the film. Aesthetically, the film doesn't come off feeling tawdry and cheap (elements which helped kill SHOWGIRLS). There is some risque material presented in the burlesque numbers, but these numbers are fun and tongue-in-cheek. There's a sensuous elegance about the whole thing. Musically, Aguilera and Cher deliver some really electrifying numbers. Cher's introduction comes by way of a fantastic number, \\"Welcome to Burlesque,\\" which establishes the Burlesque Lounge as a fun place to be in. Later on, she belts out a power ballad (which I didn't like that much), \\"You Haven't Seen the Last of Me.\\" She still has those distinctive pipes. And, when Aguilera shares a scene with a nurturing Cher, it does feel a bit like a passing of the torch.<br /><br />Aguilera is in her prime, her flair and big vocals very much on exhibit. The only knock I have is that she maybe should've done this role around a decade ago. But it definitely lends that measure of verisimilitude when the lead actress in a musical does her own singing. If you're only used to Aguilera doing her pop/R&B thing, you're in for a treat because she sings the hell out of a bunch of old school tunes, inflecting contemporary pizazz in throwback sets such as Mae West's \\"Guy What Takes His Time,\\" and Etta James' \\"Something's Got a Hold on Me\\" and the game-changing \\"Tough Lover.\\" My favorite of the lot, though, is probably her playful \\"But I Am A Good Girl.\\" Particularly welcome is the cheeky, brassy Bob Fosse touch infusing these numbers. Even Kristen Bell sexies it up with a steamy rendition of \\"Long John Blues.\\" And, yes, Bell lip-synchs to Megan Mullaly's singing. Still, she ends up delivering - with exquisite shrewness - the movie's best line: \\"I will not be upstaged by some slut with mutant lungs!\\" You can't tell me that's not an awesome bit of dialogue.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff: Audio Commentary by the writer/first time director Steven Antin; \\"The Burlesque Jukebox\\" - six full and uncut musical numbers from the film performed by the cast (including Alan Cumming's deleted cover of \\"That's Life\\" and his racy stage number \\"Jungle Berlin\\"); an alternate opening which has Christina right off belting out \\"Something's Got a Hold on Me,\\" followed by the rest of that diner scene (00:06:33 minutes long); and a blooper reel (00:05:10).cting contemporary pizazz in throwback sets such as Mae West's \\"Guy What Takes His Time,\\" and Etta James' \\"Something's Got a Hold on Me\\" and the game-changing \\"Tough Lover.\\" My favorite of the lot, though, is probably her playful \\"But I Am A Good Girl.\\" Particularly welcome is the cheeky, brassy Bob Fosse touch infusing these numbers.

B00000J6AG|3.0|well, i'm a geezer but was listening to Chill on XM, heard some remarkable music by this artist, put it on Pandora, and liked it so much that i finally bought Play/Play The B side.  the music's great.  But consider where your money is going, just to be aware.  I personally do not give a scybalum about Moby's personal or political views.  He's a gifted artist; so was Kurt Cobain, so is Carlos Santana, so was Richard Wagner.  But I just want to warn you about the nonsense in his liner notes.  Waa,waa,waa... poor moby.  We mistreat our prisoners.  Yeah, if you get put into jail for a DUI or white collar crime and you are brutalized and sodomized, that stinks.  If you made a mistake and are really trying to get your life together and pay your debt, that stinks.  We don't mistreat all of our prisoners, in fact we treat many of them too well.  But don't paint all prisoners and criminals with the same broad brush.  Some of them are the most repulsive vermin ever to walk on the planet, from terrorists to drug lords to pirates to child rapists and pornographers.  Treat them well?  What kind of crap values do you really have, Moby?  Treat someone like the guy who destroyed Polly Klaas well?  Terrorists slit the throat of a 3 year old baby last friday night.  If we were to apprehend them, would you really want them treated well?  What kind of intellectual lightweight could you possibly be?  Enjoy the music.

630587493X|5.0|No one can read every book or see every movie when it first comes out.  Leaving the books aside for this review, \\"Bicentennial Man\\" slipped under my radar until yesterday.<br /><br />The movie was given to me to watch because it was a favorite of my best friend (who has since passed away) and so I watched it with not only an open mind.....but with an open and sentimental heart.<br /><br />I loved this movie.  Robin Williams much like his idol Jonathan Winters; either is very very good or very very bad depending on what he does.<br /><br />This movie qualifies as the very very good side of Williams.  Although this movie was panned when it first premiered way back when, time has been kind to this movie and Williams' performance, is a sensitive portrayal of a machine wanting to be human.<br /><br />The story has been told before:  Pinocchio and A.I. are two examples of similar stories.  \\"Bicentennial Man\\" falls in between the two.  Not a classic like Pinocchio; but definitely a better movie than A.I. (which isn't bad either).  There is a sentimental sweetness in Bicentennial Man that reminds you of Pinocchio but is missing in A.I.<br /><br />I will purchase this movie after finishing this review.  If offers a perspective on life from a different point of view than the usual.<br /><br />I guess we can learn a thing or two from a machine............errrrrr robot.

068484267X|5.0|I knew Frank McCourt in New York City, although not well.  He kept so much to himself I didn't have many interactions with him.  He sat on a stool in the corner of his brother Alphie's restaurant/bar on the Upper West Side of New York City, where I worked, sipping a glass of something, always alone.  This was a decade before he published Angelia's Ashes.  If one word described him then it would be \\"calm,\\" although I once heard him refer to a bar customer as \\"a bloody Englishman.\\"  He was quiet, polite, his gray hair well barbered, his clothes always neat.  The loudest thing about him was his Irish face, which for all the McCourts shouted \\"Mickey.\\"  Sometimes Frank's brother Malachy came in and there would be three McCourts at the bar together.  Whenever a McCourt brother was asked a question he raised his eyebrows and stared off into the distance several seconds to ponder, pursed his lips, then answered in a resigned sigh as if loath to let go of the words.  This was usually followed with an ironic joke of some sort and then maybe a \\"Hah, hah!\\", with the accent on the last \\"hah.\\"  Frank was an okay guy.  All the McCourts were sociable sorts.<br /><br />I never suspected Frank had a rugged childhood because there wasn't a hint of it in his demeanor.  In his memoir he describes being one of an underclass of County Limerick poor (some of whom today contest the veracity of his memories) who were destitute and starving in the 1930s and 40s, living on tea and bread bought from the public dole.  The McCourts' father, Frank writes, could not go three weeks without spending all his wages on an alcoholic binge, losing his job as a result.  Their father left for work in London during WWII and seldom sent his family back anything, presumably drinking what he made and lying in English gutters on the weekends.  The harsh nature of Irish culture in Limerick at that time exacerbated the shame and humiliation felt by the McCourts for being destitute.<br /><br />I have a feeling that, like all good autobiographies, some events and characters in Frank's book were enlarged, some reduced, others adjusted and sculptured to focus and shape the narrative.  If George Orwell did that sort of thing in books like Down and Out in Paris and London then Frank McCourt deserves the same latitude.  Frank certainly re-spun the dialogue from what he remembered, aided by years being as aspiring writer and playwright.  Be that as it may, the text rings true and it is a thoroughly enjoyable book, narrated well by its writer.  It's a tribute to endurance and decidedly a book worth reading or listening to.d autobiographies, some events and characters in Frank's book were enlarged, some reduced, others adjusted and sculptured to focus and shape the narrative.

0385342047|5.0|Becky was looking forward to having a partner in shopping with her daughter - but Mini has her own mind, often creating scenes in shops & Stanta's grottos all over the malls. In addition to that - Becky, Luke, & Mini still live with Becky' parents, and has taken up a little more space than expected for her shoes, magazined, and other collections. And even though Becky & Luke had already found a few houses they liked, all of them fell through at the last moment - until the latest.<br /><br />Then the financial crisis hits, and the perfect house fell through once again - and to Becky's surprise, it seems as though her parents do not appreciate the Brandons' stay in their house as much as Becky thought. And to top it all off - Becky needs to plan Luke's surprise birthday party on a budget, and everyone around her seems to be distrustful of her ability to do so.<br /><br />In a way, in the last few books it had seemed that Becky, while still silly & a trouble magnet, had somehow grow up a bit. But this book takes Becky back to the basics of the first two books - not the mostly grownup Becky which has unlimited funds in her shared bank account with Luke which can fix any problem, but the Becky who needs to cheat & lie her way through her problems, often causing annoyance & even anger from her loved ones. And once again Becky has to use her own common sense to get herself out of trouble.
6305428425|1.0|I was really excited to get this DVD in the mail as it is one of my favorite movies of all time. I immediately noticed it was rattling around in the case and when i opened it one of the middle tabs that holds the DVD into place was broken off the the DVD was just moving around so I was not happy about that but then when I put the DVD in to watch it I was even more dissapointed. The quality of the DVD is horrible it looks like someone recorded an old VHS version themselves in zoom mode. Half of the time I couldnt see all of their faces no matter what setting I would switch my tv to. I dont know if it is just because I picked the $10 movie and maybe I should of payed up for the more expensive one? Either way it was a bad purchase.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm a beginner who was looking to work out to get healthy, not to lose weight, although I wouldn't mind that side effect :) I work 2 jobs so I have very little time to workout.  I bought this because its only 20 minutes and no matter what I do, I can't justify NOT working out for just 20 minutes a day.  I have been doing this work out for about 3 weeks now and I love it!  Its very intense, I haven't been able to go past the Level 1 yet.  Its great for beginners because every move is simple and Jillian explains everything.  I definitely feel stronger and I have a lot more energy.  I don't think I've lost any weight yet, but I can see that if I was dieting this workout would definitely help shed the pounds.  I would recommend this to someone who needs a good, short workout.
031603438X|5.0|Keith Richards' memoir, Life, is a great read on so many levels and for so many reasons  I don't know where to begin.   The first reason may actually qualify this book as a self-help tome for those who carry around a ton of guilt regarding a past full of bad choices. \\"Life\\" will make your checkered past look as though you've been living the life of a monk in comparison.  Believe me when I say that nothing you've ever done could come close to Richards' life lived in extremis. No amount of drinking, debauchery, even gun-toting partying could come close to the life Richard's portrays in this tell-all.  It's an Our Father combined with a three Hail Mary pass for those of you still having flashbacks about that time you dropped acid and ran naked through your neighbor's yard.    That he lived to tell about it is another reason entirely.  The guy deserves your ear.  He's   67 and still going strong and there's a lot to learn from him about living the life you dream of and never leaving a stone unturned when opportunity knocks.  He worked hard, played hard and amazingly remembers everything down to how much cocaine he did, where he hid it, who the judge was (there were a lot of them) and what he was wearing at the time.  His story unfolds with total candor and lots of humility, amazingly.  He comes across as quite a likable guy who could charm your grandmother.    Of course there's also the fact that he was the life force of the greatest rock `n' roll band of all time and that's not just my opinion.  Try and name any other band besides The Rolling Stones that wrote so many great songs, over such a long span, with so many hits and just so much of everything AND is still out there doing it in their sixties. You can't - there is no one else.    For those of us who rocked along with the Stones in the late 60s and into the 70s, this book is a special treat.  It's a time capsule that will make you want to dig around in closet for your black leather pants and boots, find a big doobie and kick up the volume on Let It Bleed which I'm listening to right now (without the getup or the doobie).  Since Richards remembers everything, you'll be able to fill in the blanks on what actually happened back then - a big help for the boomers out there.    Finally, for us music geeks, there's plenty to keep you happy with details on how they wrote many of their best songs.  Apparently Richards can write songs in his sleep as well as when he's falling down drunk or on a seven-day heroin binge.  He talks a lot about open five-string tuning that he discovered in the late sixties and used in Brown Sugar, Honky Tonk Women and Satisfaction.  I love the shout outs to all the Chicago rhythm and blues musicians who Richards say influenced him.  In fact, he gives plenty of credit all the way around cuz that's just the kinda guy he is.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|At first it was a typical \\"Gossip Girl\\" plot, rich, young and popular high school girls dealing with their adolescent problems.  But then, it turned into a dark, mysterious series with a lot of twists and turns.  I love how every chapter shows each character's experience and is not focused on just one character.  It's a must read for teens and young adults! :)
1591843790|5.0|I am not going to sit here and bore you with a 35 page essay like of all the other reviewers have done so far. Long story short, the book is amazing.     I expected it to be more of an instructional book but with Guy's flare. It was anything but. It first changes your heart and mind and then tells you the best ways to do the same to other people. Transforms those who don't have any skills into people who do and for those who already are a great presenter it only solidifies what you have done, polishes those finer techniques and teaches you a thing or two you didn't know.    This is a great addition to any business persons repertoire of books and is personally my 3rd or 4th Guy Kawasaki book.     Great read, must have, buy one right now!
B0034G4ORC|3.0|I would of loved this movie only for one thing the terrible filming. It gave me a head ache, the zooming and unzooming for no reason the panning of the camera so fast the picture is to blurie to see. Lets not forget the shacking of the camera. I understand the director wanted use to fell close to the action but GD way to much and why did he zoom in on everyones faces. The actions was really good in some parts. But I wish they would of went it to more depth on the aliens and I thought Aaron Eckhart did a good job, he was believable as the battle tough Marine.

0393327655|3.0|Having finished reading this book, I must say that I am quite impressed, with some notable exceptions.  A few months ago, I read Christopher Hitchens' \\"God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything\\".  In comparison, I find Harris' book to be more clearly and rationally argued, although Hitchens' book is a marvel of well crafted prose.  Whereas Hitchens conflates religion with the acts of some of its followers, Harris articulates a more precise causation - literal interpretation of barbaric passages found in the scriptures of the Abrahamic faiths.  Harris points out that religious moderates have no scriptural ground to stand on, referring to them as \\"failed fundamentalist.    The most glaring flaw with this book, is at the very beginning, where Harris describes a suicide bomber aboard a bus in Jerusalem.  He surmises that the bomber is motivated by the inherent evil contained within Islam.  In doing so, Harris misses an even greater evil contained within the Zionists' appropriation of Judaism, and their ruthless oppression of the Palestinians.    To the Zionists, God gave the Israelites the deed and title to the Holy Land; all they had to do was to take it from the Canaanites.  And take it they did (according to the Old Testament).  They took it by the organized and serial commission of armed robbery, capital murder and genocide.  Remember, according to Jewish scriptural mythology, every living thing in Jericho was put to the sword!  And this happened after the Ten Commandments forbade murder.    Apparently, the God-sanctified practice of Jewish terrorism began thousands of years before any Palestinian-Muslim ever set foot aboard a modern bus.  There is a sad, almost karmic irony that those who revere monstrous terrorist as cultural ancestor-heroes should decry the use of terror against themselves today.  Cementing their hypocrisy is the fact that terror-tactics were the resurrected by the founders of modern Israel, justified by the deluded dogma of an insanely savage and abusive tribal religion and perpetuated by a culturally-conceited ethnic group.    Why Mr. Harris should ignore such an obvious link between religion and terror is a matter of some curiosity, and, as with Hitchens, calls into question his objectivity, if not his intellectual honesty.  Perhaps he simply wanted to avoid being slandered as an anti-semite, or perhaps he just wanted to get his book published.    As with other anti-religion books, there is either an implicit or explicit claim that atheists do not engage in the same morally reprehensible acts of zealots - murder, genocide, and torture.  Mr. Harris, (like Hitchens) fails to mention the outrages of such figures as Hitler, Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot.  Clearly, atheists are no more morally entitled to throw stones than are the religionists he condemns.    Addendum 11/14/2014  In retrospect, my original rating of this book at five stars, was way too generous considering the inexcusable oversights and glaring omissions of the author.  While I continue to admire Harris' formidable intellect, as applied to the subject; I now find his reticence to take on the above mentioned religion-affiliated atrocities to be intellectually dishonest, bordering on cowardice.

B004I2K4DY|4.0|I've got no idea why there was another anniversary special.  The 10th anniversary one was spectacular.  It is like a re-make of a film that was just fine to begin with.  I'm not saying the 10th anniversary was like 'Gone with the Wind' or anything, but it was only 15 years since the last anniversary special.  The point is, should we, as opposed to \\"why bother\\"?      I did enjoy the return of the original cast reunion. I also enjoyed the expanded version that included most/all of the production, not an edited version. Nick Jonas as Marius?  In my opinion, he did not have the power to project like a broadway-type singer.  I do not think this is his forte.  Neil Patrick Harris was in an anniversary of Sweeney Todd, but he actually did the part justice.  Lea Salonga is really too old to play forta (Fontine).  I did enjoy this anniversary, but it was such a huge production and lacked the intimacy of the Royal Albert Hall.

0670022411|3.0|I really wanted to love this book.  But I didn't, and didn't like how she wound it down at the end to prepare for the next book.  I've read a lot of series that continue over the course of 3 or more books, and can't recall seeing one as poorly done on the transition execution as this one.  For those of you who are reading some of the other reviews, and note the comment \\"it's a bodice ripper\\" or \\"it's urban fantasy\\", be advised it is neither.  It's an interesting story that starts plodding about 3/4 of the way thru and just ends with a whimper.<br /><br />The good things?  I was fascinated by the author's research.  It was somewhat similar to reading a Tom Clancy, the way the writer would spend 4 - 10 pages every so often on a piece of science and/or history.  Some good nuggets to be found, and I enjoyed reading them.  Especially the genetics stuff.<br /><br />I liked the premise of the book, and the way the creatures were defined and how they co-existed.  Interesting that the author limited the scope to the three groups - witches, daemons, and vampires.  No fairies?  No werewolves?  None of the many other types of non-humans?<br /><br />I liked the various powers the witches could do.  I haven't read a book in this genre in a very long time, if at all, that goes as deep into witch culture and powers as this one.<br /><br />All that said, I won't be inspired to pick up the next book, as the last 4th just really put me off the whole thing.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I absolutely love this album. It's the very first album where I loved EVERY SINGLE ONE of the songs. Adele is beautiful, and her music is inspiring.

0316098337|5.0|Emma Donoghue's Room made me feel queasy, claustrophobic, and like the walls were closing in on me.  Yet, as I stood by helplessly watching a young boy and his mother live out their daily lives, I could not put it down!     Room is brilliantly narrated by five-year-old Jack, whose innocence and charm are the only things that make hearing his story bearable.  Jack's voice immediately transports readers into the touchingly private world that exists solely for him and his mother - except for frequent nightly visits from a man who Jack refers to as \\"Old Nick.\\"  Though Jack seems like any other normal young boy - inquisitive, energetic, funny, regimented in routine, and attached to his mother - his life has been anything but normal:  Jack's whole world is \\"Room,\\" as he sentimentally refers to it, an eleven by eleven square-foot space where he was born and raised - and where his \\"Ma\\" has endured unimaginable torture for the past seven years.   Donoghue's ability to simultaneously show and contrast Jack's naïve perception of Room against his mother's dark and disturbing view of it, is quite remarkable.       Besides the heartbreaking and terrifying story that Room depicts, it is also a tender portrayal of the mother/child relationship and celebrates the deep bond, dependence, and fierce protectiveness that exist between Jack and his mother:  Jack describes their closeness when he says, \\"She leans over me... [and] just touches her face to mine till I can't tell whose is whose\\" (134).   It is only when Ma feels that Jack's safety is threatened and Room can no longer hold them, that she decides she must risk their lives to break them out.        I did think that the novel contained one weakness in that Jack's \\"emergence\\" into the real world was a bit too easy.  But I also believe that it was probably the only option for Donoghue to keep her readers wanting to continue with a story in which they so deeply empathized with its characters -- because any other alternative would have been too horrible to imagine.        As a future English teacher, and considering the way in which Room affected me, I am concerned about the effect that its delicate subject matter might have on students.  Still, any book that can evoke such deep emotion in readers is a worthwhile endeavor.  I would discuss the subject matter in advance with students and ask them if they were comfortable with it and would like to explore it further, letting them in on the decision-making process.  I would then proceed accordingly.  If reading the book was agreed upon, I would use the Reader Response method and ask students to discuss and question the book, generate topics for further exploration - which I feel could be endless, and make their own meaning from it.  I would also have them explore and write about the book from other characters' perspectives to show how through Jack's dialogue, the language relates to readers so much more than just his feelings and view of the world.

Instead there were two copies of the CD containing symphonies 2 & 4. Maybe this was just a vagary of packing up a particular set, but the package was sealed and appeared to be new, so it could be a defect of the set in general.

B0041KKYBK|5.0|This movie `ll make you more mad by the time it ends as you`ll realize nothing changed in system .<br />Like old times bankers are still interested in collecting bonuses and making more money than providing what should be an essential service. What makes it even more frustrating is that many of the key figures behind the crisis are currently on Barak Obama's staff. The film leaves us with a bitter pill to swallow.Very interesting touch was economic professors from Harvard and Colombia that are sold out crowd getting millions for lobbying and no report of their salaries this important aspect always passed under the radar .Another lesson learn was everything that ends with Harvard doesn`t mean pure and constructive.
0613824229|4.0|Ender's Game was required reading for newly minted US Marine Corps Lieutenants at The Basic School back in 1999.  The book is an excellent introduction on the concept of maneuver warfare, albeit in a science fiction format.  In the book, Ender employs the important principles on maneuver warfare of great thinkers such as Sun Tzu, Van Creveld, and John Boyd:<br /><br />- Tempo: Tempo as illustrated by John Boyd's OODA loop.<br />- Schwerpunkt (focal point): The center of effort, or striking the enemy at the right place at the right time. According to vanCreveld, ideally, a spot that is both vital and weakly defended.<br />- Surprise: based on deception.<br />- Combined arms<br />- Flexibility: According to VanCreveld flexibility means a military must be well rounded, self contained and redundant.<br />Decentralized command: Rapid changing situations may out pace communications. Lower levels must understand overall intent.<br /><br />All of this great theory on strategic thinking is wrapped up in an easy-to-read sci-fi format.  Highly recommended to students of strategic planning, complex problem solving, and execution, from warriors to business managers.

B00110K62U|5.0|I am so glad I bought this DVD before buying the 25th anniversary concert - it is fantastic and the cast is infinitely better!  I've read other reviews about the quality of the 10th Anniversary DVD but I think the picture and sound are fine.  I bought this about two months ago when I saw that the 25th anniversary concert had been released.  I purchased this concert because I saw that Colm Wilkinson was Jean Valjean and I had seen him in the live musical in London in 1991 and he will forever be the definitive Jean Valjean to me.  Also, the end of the performance with many different actors who portrayed Jean Valjean in different countries around the world joining Colm Wilkinson on stage to sing \\"Do you hear the people sing\\" together with lines from all their native languages is stunningly beautiful and moving.  The entire ensemble of actors really is a dream cast (with the possible exception of Ruthie Henshall as Fantine - she was very good but I did miss Patti Lupone who I think was an amazing Fantine in London and on Broadway).  However, that small nitpick aside, the cast is just stand-out after stand-out.  Particularly spectacular performances are given by Phillip Quast as Javert and the absolute delight of Alun Armstrong as Thenardier - his rendition of \\"Master of the House\\" is a truly joyful experience that should not be missed by anyone who is a true fan of the musical - the entire stage of actors who are behind Alun as he sings that song are visibly delighted and enjoying his rendition of that song as much as the audience.  Conversely, the 25th Anniversary edition concert is a true disappointment - the cast is just not as strong all the way across the board.  I am a person who LOVES the live musical - I've seen it twice in London and twice on Broadway and if you're like me and are just a true fan of the musical, the 10th Anniversary dream cast concert is a must.  It is a joy to watch and makes me happy and inspired every time I watch it and I really believe others will feel the same way!
B0002BO05S|4.0|Firstly let me just state that this is one of my very favourite movies. Being a christian I am obviously interested in the subject matter and being an enthusiast for historical epic spectaculars (especially those photographed in Ultra Panavison as this one was) this is the type of movie that definitely interests me the most.    Secondly let me focus on the definite qualities of this film. It is superlatively photographed in Technicolour & Ultra Panavison (Ultra Panavision being the technical successor to \\"3 strip Cinerama\\" which George Stevens had originally considered using in this film but eventually deciding upon the easier to use Ultra Panavison format and still present this film in \\"Cinerama\\"-- a large curved screen format of showing movies similar to the modern day Imax system). It has magnificent, very large \\"purpose-built\\" sets, an expert & sometimes very moving musical score and has a large and reasonably talented cast. It also features an original musical score from that modern American film music master Alfred Newman that at times, at least for christians, is immensely moving. It also benefits from George Steven's decision to film the movie in the South Western United States of America because, according to him, \\"that part of USA looks more like the Holy Land that the modern day Holy Land does\\".  This decision yields some stunning landscapes (especially in the raising of Lazarus sequence) and makes the film look as if it was filmed in the Israel of Jesus's time. One issue that this film in particular gives focus to (and others religious films have not) is the role of the female disciples in the story of Jesus. Mary Magdalene (obviously), Mary, Mother of Jesus (again obviously) both feature as important characters in this and other religious epics but this film gives prominence to both Mary & Martha of Bethany (the sisters of Lazarus) whom most other religious epics have chosen not to mention. As well the landscapes & settings do look very authentic--beingpopulated with marching roman soldiers at various locations in several scenes and featuring virtual forests of multiple wooden crosses (with dying human beings attached) lining the roadways in various locations. This must have been how ancient Judea was at the time of Jesus. The signs of Roman occupation and oppression everywhere.    Thirdly let me now focus on the variable parts of the movie. As I said earlier, from my point of view, the technical aspects of this film are superlative. Where the movie starts to go astray is in the casting and indeed in the very concept of the film. Max Von Sydow by the end of the movie makes a definitely impressive Jesus and this is, I think, more due to Von Sydow's acting abilities rather than George Steven's concept of Jesus. This Jesus looks rather unusual with reasonably shortish hair and an under grown beard rather than a full beard. Religious jews of this era would most definitely have had a full beard. Also there's something \\"strange\\" if not \\"queer\\" about the look of this Jesus that George Stevens has conjured up. Instead of a manly and youthful Jesus as Jeffrey Hunter in \\"King of Kings\\" (who wears a dark red ROBE at times) or the mystical and attractive Jesus of \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" or the masochistic but charismatic Jesus of \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" here we are presented with a Jesus that, at first, appears reasonably effeminate. Maybe even a gay or homosexual Jesus. And he has BLUE EYES. As did Jeffrey Hunter (King of Kings) and Robert Powell (Jesus of Nazareth). What is this fascination with Hollywood about a BLUE EYED Jesus that looks as if he came from Northern Europe or California and not from ancient Judea? The real Jesus would most definitely have had long hair (not cropped hair), a full beard and an olive complexion. He most probably WOULD NOT HAVE HAD BLUE EYES. So the look of Jesus in this movie is all wrong. Without being blasthemous I think THE LOOK of JESUS in the Jesus character briefly seen in the very first part of Monty Python's \\"The Life of Brian\\" (the sermon on the mount sequence) is probably the most accurate version on film of how Jesus actually looked in real life. Also in the \\"Greatest Story Ever Told\\" Jesus wears plain white clothing with no RED ROBE (made of homespun cloth as in The Robe, Demetrius & The Gladiators and King of Kings) to be seen in any sequence. Come to think of it most of the other cast members wear white or pastel shades of clothing (the apostles and disciples) or black or dark shades (the pharisees and members of the sanhedrin) in this movie. Maybe the good guys in white and the bad guys in black situation. A definite choice of costume colours made by George Stevens. Hardly anyone wears any bright coloured clothing in this movie! With the execption of Mary Magdalene who wears a slinky crimson red outfit in her first scenes.    The other reasonably talented cast members are quite effective and convincing in their roles. But one MAJOR problem nearly upsets this carefully constructed drama about the life of Jesus. And that is the OBVIOUS PROBLEM of the VERY UNWISE DEVICE of featuring a who's who of famous Hollywood stars of that time (1964-1965) in \\"cameo\\" roles (especially at the time of this film's release in 1965 when these stars were very well known). I remember seeing this film in its original Cinerama release (a big curved screen format of exhibition similar to today's IMAX presentations) and being continually off put from the drama of the film by the appearance every so often of Carroll Baker, Shelley Winters, Sidney Poitier & The Professor from Gilligan's Island all trying to look dignified and noble but ending up by hamming up the situation and nearly ruining the drama. And then there's Ed Wynn (a famous comedian of the 1930's & 1940's who'd had a revival of sorts appearing in \\"Mary Poppins\\" a year earlier in 1964) who tries mighty hard to act dramatically but you get the feeling he's about to burst out giggling at any moment. However worst of all is John Wayne as a roman centurion at Christ's crucifixion. In a western, a crime drama or even a comedy John Wayne was great but not here in a serious drama about the life of Jesus. Mr. Wayne himself may well have been a very religious person but he doesn't belong in this film. This \\"special guest appearance\\" nearly ruins the entire film as a serious drama even though he only has one line to say. And the way that John Wayne says \\"trewly this maan was the sun of gawd\\" just about ruined several viewer's appreciation of the crucifixion sequence if not the entire film. Next you expect to see Jerry Lewis driving a chariot running over someone's hat as in \\"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\\".  Also its been pointed out that nearly half the supporting cast of this film soon after found fame on television (most notably David McCallum in The Man from Uncle, Jamie Farr in Mash, Telly Savalas in Kojak and The Professor in Gilligan's Island). And yes, Judas hanged himself and did not fall into a fire. Again the blame must be laid against George Stevens who invented this part of the bible story instead of sticking to the gospels. And as for Charlton Heston's John The Baptist being the most impressive male character. Well I suppose after Jesus is portrayed as being reasonably effeminate (riding into Jerusalem side-saddle on a donkey) and Heston plays a strong, manly character I guess for most people there is no contest here. By the way, my favourite character in this film is Telly Savalas and his no nonsense, brutal, soldier-governor version of Pontius Pilate which, to me, seems the most accurate version of Pontius Pilate if we are to believe the various historical records and not just the gospels.    Lastly, and this gets to the nub of the problem with this film and explains (in my opinion) why the film bombed at the box office (cost: $20 million USA and WORLWIDE GROSS: $12 million USA). And that is the entire concept of the production. The original version of thisfilm ran 260 minutes OR 4 HOURS and 20 MINUTES of non-stop religious philosophy. Where was the big chariot race in the middle of the film to take the audience's mind off the religious philosophy for a while as in \\"Ben Hur\\". Even the similarly-themed \\"King of Kings\\" (1961 version) saw the need to intersperse a big battle between the roman soldiers and the jewish zealots led by Barabbas to interupt the religious philosophy. Indeed the film \\"Barrabas\\" features an extremely exciting gladiator sequence to excite the audience for a while. \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\" does not even give us Salome's dance of the 7 veils & John The Baptist's head on a silver platter to relieve the continuous religious philosophy. Apparently at the world premiere in either Washington or New York in 1965 (with the 4 hour 20 minute version) every so often a loud knocking noise could be heard which was not on the film's soundtrack. This was apparently the film's hard cover souvenir program hitting the cinema's floor as people nodded off to sleep. Alfred Hitchcock at one of the film's USA premiere's dubbed this film \\"The Longest Story Ever Told\\".    Here I must confess that I have only seen the 199 minute currently available version several times at the cinema (in 70mm and Cinerama) and on dvd and the shorter 150 minute version at the cinema & on tv but have never actually seen either the 230 minute or 260 minute versions. I strongly suspect that very few people have ever actually seen the 230 minute or 260 minute versions. The original premiere 260 minute version was withdrawn quickly after the film's various premieres in USA and was apparently replaced firstly by a shorter 230 minute version and then by the current shorter 199 minute version. Even shorter versions were to follow in a desperate effort to try to get back the film's massive production costs. This film cost $20 million USA in 1962/1963 dollars (when it was filmed) which is the equivalent today of approximately $200 million USA.That makes this film one of the most expensive films ever made. According to IMDB this film has a worldwide gross of just $12 million USA. Obviously just a small proportion of the one billion christians around the world in 1965 and 1966 turned out to see this film. I wonder why?    And this is why I say that George Stevens is the main culprit here due to his erroneous belief that audiences in 1965 and 1966 (and indeed any audience at any time) would put up with 4 HOURS & 20 MINUTES of non-stop religious philosophy with no break for an audience via a spectacular chariot race, gladiatorial or fighting sequence. And his concept of Jesus as an effeminate mummy's boy who could not even grow a full beard or his hair long (as was the fashion in Jesus's time). As I said earlier it is due to Max von Sydow's considerable acting abilities that he eventually convinces the audience, after a while, that this Jesus is actually something much better than the way he looks. There was also the concession to modern (at that time) \\"Cinerama\\" style \\"cameo\\" or \\"special guest appearances\\" by some of the then major Hollywood stars which was extremely unwise in a serious drama about the life of Jesus. I feel that these literally FATAL FLAWS doomed this film to box office oblivion in an era when the newly evolving sexual revolution, the aftermath of JFK's assassination, James Bond, The Beatles, the Italian spaghetti westerns, the Vietnam War and the impending nuclear war between the super powers that could break out at any time were changing the tastes of audiences everywhere. Obviously most audiences in 1965 & 1966 regarded this film as an old style biblical epic dinosaur vaguely resembling previous biblical epics but without any exciting big action sequences. So the majority of audiences in 1965 & 1966 just avoided this film as a relic of the past.    Having said all that I still must admit that this film is an extraordinarily courageous, if naive (given its unrealistic attitude to an audience's endurance to non stop religious philosophy), attempt to create a spectacularly beautiful testament on film of the religious philosophy of Jesus Christ. This review is based on the current 199 minute version and not on either the longer or shorter versions. It is interesting to speculate whether the coming blue ray version will feature any additional footage or even be the 230 minute version or even the full 260 minute version. Somehow I doubt it as the missing one hour of this film (if it is able to be found) probably won't be included in any future versions. It deserves to be included but probably won't be.
B004I2K4DY|2.0|I am so glad I bought the 10th Anniversary concert along with buying the 25th anniversary concert.  The 10th Anniversary is fantastic and the cast is infinitely better than 25th Anniversary cast! I've read other reviews about the quality of the 10th Anniversary DVD but the picture and sound are fine. I bought the 10th Anniversary about two months ago when I saw that the 25th anniversary concert had been released. I purchased the 10th Anniversary concert because I saw that Colm Wilkinson was Jean Valjean and I had seen him in the live musical in London in 1991 and he will forever be the definitive Jean Valjean to me. Also, the end of the performance on the 10th Anniversary edition which has many different actors who portrayed Jean Valjean in different countries around the world joining Colm Wilkinson on stage to sing \\"Do you hear the people sing\\" together with lines from all their native languages is stunningly beautiful and moving. The entire ensemble of actors really is a dream cast - it is just stand-out after stand-out perfomances.  Particularly spectacular performances are given by Phillip Quast as Javert and the absolute delight of Alun Armstrong as Thenardier - his rendition of \\"Master of the House\\" in the 10th Anniversary concert is a truly joyful experience that should not be missed by anyone who is a true fan of the musical - the entire stage of actors who are behind Alun as he sings that song are visibly delighted and enjoying his rendition of that song as much as the audience. Conversely, the 25th Anniversary edition concert is a true disappointment - the cast is just not as strong all the way across the board and even some of the stronger performances just do not compare to the renditions in the 10th Anniversary DVD. I am a person who LOVES the live musical - I've seen it twice in London and twice on Broadway and if you're like me and are just a true fan of the musical, the 10th Anniversary dream cast concert is a must - so I would really recommend thatconcert version over this 25th anniversary edition. The 10th Anniversary concert is a joy to watch and makes me happy and inspired every time I watch it and I really believe others will feel the same way!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I am definitely not an expert on the subject matter of the film, but the logic and testimony bring the viewer to some very clear conclusions that the most apathetic citizens can not afford to ignore. I highly recommend this video, especially for those that assume the current financial and corporate laws are good enough.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|NCIS is my favorite show of ALL TIME.  This show is so interresting and funny and informative.  I really wouldn't say it a drama like they say on TV.  I would consider it more of a comedy/action show.  The cast is absolutely perfect and wouldn't want that to change one bit.  Everyone has their own role in the show, and I hope there are many many more seasons to come.  An absolute must for anyone who likes this hit TV show.
B000BT97AO|4.0|Now here's one movie the likes of which you rarely see! Partly a fairytale, partly a wildly surrealist dream (with nightmarish ingredients added).  The storyline could perhaps be defined as a young woman's maturing story in the context of  a daughter-mother relationship, with (pseudo?)Freudish overtones. I'm not quite certain all the time when watching this film how much sense it actually makes. However, if you like the works of Salvador Dali, Hieronymus Bosch, record cover illustrator Roger Dean's and Giorgio de Chirico's paintings, or George Herriman's Krazy Kat comics strips - in that case Mirrormask might be for you. Compared to other films that it reminds me of, here are some: German expressionist films of the 1920s' and 30s', Wizard of Oz, Czech puppet animator Jiri Trnka's works, Alex Proyas' Dark City, Disney's Alice in Wonderland, Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow and Corpse Bride, Monty Python's TV series and Eraserhead (not a masterpiece like Lynch's work, though).  I guess this list gives you some idea what you're in for, if you see the film. Mirrormask is a real visual feast, and a truly weird movie.
B003UESJDI|4.0|\\"Tamara Drewe\\" is deadly clever comedy of manners with a wickedly British sense of black humor. Post-plastic-surgery, the gorgeous Tamara Drewe comes home to her boring rural village -- ostensibly to fix up and sell her deceased mother's house, but also to show up everyone who was cruel to her when she was a bright, angry teenager with an outsize nose. One of those people was her writer neighbor, a serial adulterer who reigns over the fawning guests at the farm/writer's colony actually run by his devoted and ultra-capable wife. Throw in the hot local handyman, a couple of dangerously bored teenaged girls, the drummer from a punk band, and a mannerless dog. All kinds of trouble ensue. Don't expect any noble characters or heroic actions from this movie; watch it to enjoy the spectacle of people behaving mostly -- but not totally -- badly, and doing it in a generally clever and funny way.
B001FB5634|2.0|I still don't know if I liked this film--one indication that I really didn't is that I feel no desire at all to see it again and find out.  It's a well made movie, but it unfortunately relies far too much on \\"Here come the cannibals, so let's hide\\" as a tool to add a bit of action in an otherwise action-free film.  I liked the performances, but the script left them little room to bring their performances to a higher level.  I feel that the relationship between the father and son was well crafted, but I really don't see these two having survived for as long as they have--they react to everything, and still haven't learned to act on their own, even several years after the event that destroyed the earth.  The fact that they have just two bullets--and soon just one--is a bit contrived given the number of deserted homes that there are in the world.    The pace of the film is ponderous at best.  It plods; it doesn't move.  The father seems to want to leave a legacy behind, but soon becomes one of the \\"bad guys.\\"  He seems to teach his son nothing about survival--only about how to kill himself properly and easily.  There are just too many things here that don't add up, or that come up empty, for me to rate this any higher.  The one that still bothers me immensely is the fact that even with the roving bands of cannibals around, these two had a roaring fire going every night--almost as if they're saying \\"Here we are!\\"  Come on. . . .
B000JMLFLW|5.0|This is, in my opinion, the best novel Jane Austen wrote, although Mansfield Park follows close on its heels. And while there are a few spelling and grammatical errors here and there in the kindle edition, it is worth it to have it on kindle. This fast-paced story is hard to put down, and if you have not yet read it you really should give it a try. Forget the many versions you may have seen of the movie, which even the best of does not do justice to the novel, and sit yourself down with this for a wonderful ride. Humorous, witty and entertaining, it is well worth your time!
B001BPQT8A|4.0|After the abysmal failure of Alien 3, David Fincher held his breath for three years and made a new start with Se7en. His signature style of direction is all over it. Se7en is filthier than a dead stray dog at the bottom of a New Jersey toxic waste dump. It looks so miserable that people nailed to crosses seem happier.<br /><br />The plot explores the extreme pitch-black side of the human psyche and was entirely the creation of one writer. Andrew Kevin Walker, a former Tower Records employee, conceived, in hell, a heinous story of a serial killer who offs his victims in the style of the Seven Deadly Sins. What was he smoking when he came up with that idea? Brad Pitt plays David Mills, an arrogant, over-confident, semi-experienced detective who is way ahead of himself. He uproots from a decent precinct, dragging his suffering wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) with him, to transfer to the worst in town - an unnamed, rainier-than-Glasgow Los Angeles - for no other reason than \\"to make a difference\\". Good luck.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is William Somerset, the most jaded and world-weary cop on the force. He only has a few days with Mills before retiring to a simple life in the country. Mills could learn a lot from him, and if he had any sense, he would. Sadly, this does not happen.<br /><br />In Fight Club, Fincher exposed the rotten underbelly of a free society, the seedy flipside of American culture that most people pretend doesn't exist. Somerset says the only way to deal with a world this bad is to be apathetic, the polar opposite to Mill's belief that he can make the world a better place.<br /><br />Few scripts make for good reading, but Andrew Kevin Walker's writing is one of the film's many strengths. He explored dark, character-driven horror/drama in shockers such as Brainscan and 8mm, but this is the meanest. The irony of each victims' death is made entirely justified by the killer's logic behind the madness. Of course, he does not believe he is insane. Just the world he lives in. Haven't you ever felt like that? It is important for such movies to have an atmosphere and Se7en is so rank that you can smell it. Pitt and Freeman deliver great performances, although Pitt should learn to breathe through his nose and not have constantly pursed lips. It becomes quite annoying.<br /><br />Se7en is definitely the film that kick-started Fincher's career. Had he made The Game right after Alien 3, there would have been no Fight Club, Panic Room, or Social Network.<br /><br />For that tiny minority who knows nothing of the film it's high time you checked it out. Even if you don't enjoy, you cannot deny its power and effect.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks brilliant in 1080p 2.35:1 widescreen with DTS HD-MA sound. Plenty of grimy extras are included.like that?

B004FGMV0W|5.0|This is by far one of the best albums I have bought this past year!  Avril has matured so much through this album.  There are so many strong points on the record.  Especially songs like \\"Everybody Hurts\\", \\"Goodbye\\" and \\"Not Enough\\" which show her strength as a vocalist and as a writer.  There are also fun songs on the album, like \\"Smile\\" that will surely be stuck in your head.  One of my personal favorites is \\"Darlin\\" which is a song that she wrote when she was 15.  You will not regret buying this album...I promise you.

B002Y5FKUE|5.0|\\"Huh? Couldn't you say that for all operas?\\"<br /><br />No, not really. Most operas also involve good music. The music per se of Vincenzo Bellini's \\"La Sonnambula\\" is so rudimentary one hardly needs to hear it. That's as Bellini intended; his opera is a vehicle for \\"bel canto\\", for unabashed display of beautiful voices. La Sonnambula is like a triple-dip ice cream cone; the three roles of Amina, Elvino, and Count Rodolfo are the three scoops of gelato and the orchestra/chorus are the cone ... and there's not even a waffle cone at Gelateria Bellini!<br /><br />Also, some operas have dramatic merits -- intelligent librettos, emotive impact, and/or slapdash wit. The libretto of La Sonnambula is ludicrous and the `plot' is mediocre even by the vaudeville standards of 19th C opera. But who cared or cares, in the realm of bel canto! It's the singing! Turn off the subtiltes and do you think you'll miss anything? Trust me, you won't.<br /><br />La Sonnambula is supposed to be set in a Swiss village, some miles below a vacant castle. The village belle, Amina, is bethrothed to the village beau, Elvino; their wedding is planned for the morrow. Lisa, another village maiden, is fuming with jealousy. The lovers, however, sing rapturously of their happiness. Suddenly a suave, elegant stranger appears, asking directions to the castle, though it emerges that he's oddly familiar with the region. The castle is too far to reach before nightfall, so the stranger accepts a room at the inn managed by Lisa. The villagers warn the stranger that a hideous \\"phantom' roams the region by night, but the stranger scoffs. Night falls.<br /><br />Okay, are you ready? The stranger is in reality the long-absent Count Rodolfo, incognito for no reason that is ever revealed in the libretto. The phantom is none other than Amina, a sleepwalker/sonnambula, who strolls into the Count's bedroom unaware of her action. The good Count suppresses his lust and leaves her untouched in his bed, where she is discovered the next morning. Elvino goes \\"Italian\\" with jealousy and prepares to marry Lisa instead ... Have courage, dear romantics! All will be resolved.<br /><br />The three bollas of gelato in this cone -- absolutely superb gelato, as good as any from Tre Scalini on the Piazza Navona in Rome! -- are Natalie Dessay as Amina, Juan Diego Flores as Elvino, and veterate basso Michele Pertusi as Rodolfo. Florez sings like a God, as `they' used to say of Caruso; he sings with such \\"sprezzatura\\" that he nearly steals the show from Dessay. [\\"Sprezzatura\\" was the word used in the early baroque for musicianship so disdainfully perfect that it could strut itself without restraint. Che bello voce ha il peruano!] Dessay has `matured' as a musician enough to compensate for a little tiredness of voice in the second act; her phrasing and tuning are sublime throughout, and she recovers her `fire' in time for her jaw-and-curatin dropping final aria. Just how good she really is is clarified by comparing her to Jennifer Black in the much easier role of Lisa. Black's vocal gifts don't include beautiful timbre; in fact she's screechy, scoopy, and her highest notes are seldom pitch perfect. She sings the first aria, and if you haven't ejected the DVD after it, you'll gasp with sensual pleasure at Dessay's first musical phrase.<br /><br />In keeping with my gelato metaphor, if the singers are the ice cream and the drama the mere cone, the production - sets and costuming - is the thin sheet of paper wrapped around the cone to keep it from dripping. This production isn't at all visually splendid or charming. The gossip is that it was hated by audiences at the Met and panned by the critics. It reconceives the drama self-referentially, as a rehearsal of the opera in a back studio almost as shabby as the actual practice rooms of most opera houses. It's not incoherent. It's not such a dim idea. One could even say it \\"works\\", but it misses its audience completely. This is a concept addressed to an audience of insiders who have seen half a dozen productions of La Sonnambula, who have a full set of memories of those productions, and who crave some irreverence. First-timers won't \\"get it.\\" Devout Belliniphiles want the whole lasagna, Dirndl dresses and all. Fine, give `em what they want! It doesn't matter. The production is merely a ploy for hiring the singers!<br /><br />In that case, you ask, why not just listen to a CD? Is it just the subtitles? Well, let me ask you: why not just get your three scoops of ice cream in the palm of your hand? or do you need the stale tastless cone and the inedible paper sheath after all?oductions of La Sonnambula, who have a full set of memories of those productions, and who crave some irreverence.

B004I2K4DY|5.0|I will say Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean was the highlight for me. He was fantastic. I did also enjoy Eponine's portrayal. My biggest amusement is how many people are up in arms over Nick Jonas. I was fully prepared to dislike him before I saw this show. I think I may have actually shuddered when I heard he was playing Marius. However, I found nothing to dislike. I should have stopped being snobby long enough to listen. His voice may not have been as powerful/trained, but he still has an excellent voice and I thought his portrayal of Marius was very convincing.

B002ZG9846|5.0|Simply put: I waited for so long to watch the kick-ass. I don't know why it is such a  good and funny movie. And Hit-Girl is totally adorable. Loved her part very much. Red Mist played a good role...a sweet costume and outlook but totally a bastard. Kick-Ass himself was okay. Not my favorite out of them 4 but it's a movie about him and it's damn fine. I am not sure whether there will be made part 2, books confuse me. But I'll be waiting for it. Of course only if the hit-girl will have her part in it. Coz she is so cool. This is in no way just for kids or a teenagers. The movie is rated R for a reason.
B000V698DI|5.0|Nevermind wasn't a 90s sensation for no reason. Kurt Cobain's obscurity to his lyrics is what made Nevermind the gem that it is. I understand if you don't appreciate his voice, or simple guitar riffs, or grunge/alternative in general, but the songs were obscure, carefully crafted pieces that made people see that you didn't have to be a rock star to make fantastic music.  I feel one of the biggest reasons people criticize this album so readily is because they don't understand the rhetoric each song is using, therefore they don't understand the true meaning, resulting in a confused listener who hears random words and thinks, \\"this makes no sense\\". The metaphors he uses in the album are nothing short of amazing. A perfect example of this is \\"Polly\\", which describes a woman who held against her will and raped, using the parrot analogy to describe her imprisoned (caged) condition.  Aside from brilliant metaphors and word play, Nirvana keeps the songs at a level of simplicity that is approachable musically. Simple guitar riffs with Krist Novoselic's well timed bass and Dave Grohl's tight drumming keep Cobain's brainchild carefully knitted into an album that reminds us of childhood and helps us realize we're not the only ones who see problems with the way the world was and still is.  Nevermind was a breakthrough in that it gave us songs to listen to that had a serious artistic goal planned. I understand Kurt Cobain was not the most talented vocalist or guitarist and Nirvana was not the most talented band ever, but this album introduced us to a different side of music and rock that is rare to find in any previous or current artist. From the baby penis to the paper-thin vocals, Nirvana showed us that vanity and being radio-friendly is not what music is about, but rather being real in a desire to just rock, and Nevermind does exactly that.
B000AYQNYI|5.0|I just purchased a 2010 Acura TL and it comes standard with a single disc DVD-Audio player from Panasonic designed by Elliot Schiner who is well known for his surround mixes for top bands and performers.  Since the format is dying off and/or dead, finding good material is difficult and expensive as most of the good stuff is now considered a collectible.  Then I learned about the DualDisc option.  Slippery When Wet was a favorite album of mine from the 1980's and has more listenable songs than throw-aways so for $15 I decided to give it a chance.  Wow!  The remixes in surround sound are unbelievable - especially the intro of \\"Livin on a Prayer\\" and \\"Social Disease\\" (turn the disc over to the CD side to really appreciate the difference).  This is, by far, my favorite DVD-Audio disc and will get hours of playback.

On top of that, there is no background whatsoever as to how the society became what it is. Life is just too short to spend on something that doesn't catch my interest.  I've read blurbs comparing this to the Mockingjay series...that is a huge error.  This is nothing like that series at all.

B003UESJDI|1.0|First, she sleeps with everybody who asks, even as a teen! Not exactly making good choices. And the only good line in the movie is \\"Why does the assh**e always get the girl?\\" Hardly profound since it's obvious that's what this girl prefers! And if you are a dog Lover you will hate the part where the assh**e she ends up with deliberately kills the rock drummers dog!! Very bad since it adds nothing to the story but then there really isn't any story. Too long and too boring. The bored teen-age girls should watch this movie & be really bored.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|This may be one of the most important movies made in the last decade. For me, reviewing a Michael Moore movie positively represents almost a seismic shift in ideology. Just last year I was still a pro-life, pro-marriage conservative. I am still pro-life, I still believe marriage to be between a man and a woman, but I have absolutely come to reject the party that for so long I thought represented me. I watched this movie after this ideological trip, but it confirmed for me that the change in my thinking was correct, and that I had changed my mind for the right reasons.<br /><br />Like Mr. Moore, I was aghast at the bail-out of Wall Street in the wake of the financial crisis. I found it abominable that enough tax payer dollars to pay off every mortgage in America were given away for free to our nation's richest, and most irresponsible, class: Wall Street Bankers.<br /><br />I thought for awhile that radical conservatives, such as Ron Paul, had the correct solution. However, once I read more deeply and saw how anti-union, anti-worker, and even anti-civil rights these radical libertarian conservatives were I rejected them out of hand. I had studied Ayn Rand in graduate school, and I had long been of the mind that libertarianism was both flawed and evil. Social Darwinism is a repulsive concept.<br /><br />So, where to turn? If union-busting free-traders who advocated the destruction of the American middle class (and therefore the traditional family) were to be rejected, and pro-death anti-traditional marriage Democrats were to be rejected, what was the answer?<br /><br />I do not know. The only thing I do know is that Mr. Moore has made a compelling film, deeply rooted not just in social justice, but in the faith he and I both share (Catholicism). I am uncomfortable with Mr. Moore's social liberalism, and his inclusion of the disgraced Bishop Gumbleton in this documentary, but I am not in any way (like some of our conservative co-religionists are) compelled to reject this man or his work. He uses humor and satire to clearly communicate the weaknesses with the predominant culture. In this sense, his work for me bears a resemblance to G.K. Chesterton's. There is even a similarity in appearance between the two men which I find compelling!<br /><br />I am grateful that Mr. Moore allows his faith to guide his work. He is an amazing film maker, and a deep thinker. Most importantly, he gets us to think. He approaches his work through the lens of faith; he goes to Mass, and tries to put his faith into the world.<br /><br />What else could one possibly ask? Of course, that he becomes pro-life, and that he realizes that abortion is a big-business that benefits only the rich. Perhaps he will come to that realization someday. One can only hope. Until then, I think his work on economics, and his work on this film, is important and deeply rooted in truth.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Moore, for your outstanding work.<br /><br />Addenda: (added April 1st)<br /><br />While I refuse to delete this review, or run away from it, I heard a very disturbing interview this evening with Mr. Moore. He stance on abortion, and his view of pro-lifers in specific, is extreme in its lack of charity, and in its pro-death bias. This is so sad. Our country is falling apart, in no small measure, because people are afraid to speak truth and be prophetic, or are unable to be charitable towards those with whom they disagree. Elitists on the left (like Moore) and on the right (like George Weigel) are too arrogant to think critically about the whole of what Christ and the Church stand for.<br /><br />Sad, sad sad. Mr. Moore's work will forever be flawed by his pro-death ideology. What is the use of our right to a job, or our right to a living wage, if we do not even enjoy the right to life?<br /><br />Real Americans are getting desperate. We want leadership that is competent, both morally and fiscally. We, as a whole, REJECT the notion that babies should be slaughtered in the womb at any point during pregnancy. We REJECT the notion that marriage is just about adults and not children. However, the democratic party (and people like Mr. Moore) want to pretend that these reasonable and defensible positions are extreme or wrong.<br /><br />Thus, the democratic party loses election after election. They are so enamored of the killing of infants (which is what abortion is) and degrading the institution of marriage that they do not care a whit for the reasonable positions of many Americans. People like me are almost forced to vote Republican, even though every stance the Republican party takes on issues like the environment, or workers rights, or foreign policy, trouble us deeply.<br /><br />Mr. Moore: WAKE UP. Abortion is an industry! It is an industry that makes massive amounts of money taking advantage of (and often harming physically) poor women! Women deserve better! Put your faith into action completely, or many will simply not listen to the GOOD things you have to say!

B00005UKKF|5.0|The DVD of the Dream Within a Dream tour is so visually beautiful to watch even my family members who aren't Britney Spears fans were watching it.  I admit, some of the song redentions were a bit hokey though.  At the time, this was Britney's most well produced tour.  Beautiful costumes, great dance routines in which Britney puts her heart and soul into, cool special effects, and just great overall energy.  At one point, she even takes a break to address the audience and what she says comes from the heart and really shows her sweet personality.    This DVD is also family friendly and doesn't contain any of the adults themes that were included in subsequent concert tours.

B002ZG99NG|5.0|THE TOWN is a film you've seen a million times before, but executed so sharply it feels new and fresh all over again.  Ben Affleck wasn't the best choice to play the leading role, a hardened criminal with a speck of decency left in him, but he looks for the unusual sides of the character and finds them.  In a way his role is more difficult than that of the freak Jeremy Renner is playing, where all he has to do is rave and look inhuman and menacing.  Affleck must seem to be growing and changing, as he encounters the beautiful bank manager played by the gorgeous Rebecca Hall.  Somehow she allows him to be a way he has never let himself be before, and he lets his defenses down when he's with her.<br /><br />Of course the whole romance feels doomed, because we know that somewhere down the line she is going to discovered that Doug is among the gang of foolishly dressed robbers who held her hostage during a brutal armed robbery.<br /><br />That is the Damocles' sword that propels the tension of the movie.  But there are other sources of tension too, including the presence of beautiful, beatup Blake Lively, who plays the sister of Jeremy Renner, the former girlfriend of Ben Affleck, and the mother of a young child she often deserts in order to carry out her job as runner for an Oxcontin ring.  Blake Lively is great as Serena in GOSSIP GIRL, but until you seen her here you might think she's got willful debutante under her belt and that's all she is.  In her Gloria Grahame role here she knocked me out.  The gossips claim that behind the scenes, she made trouble for Ben Affleck's marriage and watching some of her scenes I can see why!  Both the leading ladies in this film are exemplary and it made me think of how solidly director Affleck elicited strong performances from the women in his previous directorial effort, GONE BABY GONE, in which Michelle Monaghan and Amy Ryan were both really \\"on.\\"  And here Hall and Lively are even better, so what does that tell you?  Maybe Affleck is the new George Cukor!orge Cukor!

0385504225|5.0|After reading this I thought I should give this 4 stars as I preferred \\"Angels & Demons\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". Then I thought if I read this and it was from a little known author I would be blown away and give it 5 stars, so should I penalise Brown because of my huge expectations? No.   I've read all of Brown's books and I think this book has the best villain. Malakh is such a loathsome character. People criticise Brown for his formulaic writing and admittedly they have a point, but then a lot of the world's most famous songwriters also compose their songs based on a successful formula and they don't suffer the same level of criticism.   What I like is the way Brown can portray intricate symbology and philosophy and describe it in such a way that it is easy & enjoyable to understand for a layperson (like myself) in a non-patronising way without slowing the action at all. That takes skill.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I first time I saw Spirited Away was in movie theaters.  It was my first time watching a Hayao Miyazaki animated film.  I have since seen many of his other animated movies and highly recommend them.  There is so much imagination that is present in this movie.  There is magic and elements of the super natural in this movie.  It's a great coming of age story about a young girl becoming independent.  Highly recommended.

B002ZG980U|2.0|This is the kind of movie that I love, so I hate that I didn't like it.  This movie is too long and has a weak storyline.  All of the action sequences seemed like they had been copied from a Bond film.  The movie is visually interesting, but the writing is so poor that I didn't really care about the characters.
1416914293|4.0|What can I say about this one.  Well it sure did not disappoint for being the second book.  The first one was so good but I think this one was even better.  This one kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.  With it's non stop suspense and action I didn't want to put it down.  While Clary's mom Jocelyn is still under a spell Clary is fighting demons and Valentine non stop.  Her relationship with Simon has become something more and yet she still has feelings for Jace.  I mean who wouldn't, I would choose Jace over Simon any day.  Simon is great though and now that he is a Vampire it just makes his character stronger.  I like Alec and Magnus together, I was laughing when Clary put the \\"No Fear\\" Rune on Alec and he almost told his parents about him and Mangus.  My favorite part though was when they were in the Faery court and Clary had to do what the Queen said to be released.  Don't want to say if someone has not read it yet.  The battle on Valentine's ship was incredible and well thought out.  You never knew what was coming next.  I never know when Valentine is telling the truth and when he is lying. Something the Inquisitor said to Jace about his scar has me thinking.  I really hope that Jace and Clary find out that they are not brother and sister.  I really enjoyed reading this, the story just gets better with each book.  I can't wait to read the third one and I have the fourth one pre ordered already.  If you haven't started this series yet, you need to!
B004GBIE3Y|2.0|I saw the previews, and wanted to see it in the theater, but I never got around to it. I saw that it was available on Amazon Instant View, and that it had a 4 1/2 star customer rating, so I decided to watch it. I knew that the critics had given it poor reviews, but I generally go by the general publics perception rather than the overly cynical film critics. After watching It's Kind of a Funny Story, I agree with the critics...this was not a good film.     1. The young star of the film is a lousy actor. He's supposed to be portraying someone who is suicidal, or who has suicidal thoughts...but he plays the character like he's just an awkward everyday teenager.     2. The film depicts people within the psychiatric ward as more quirky than mentally ill.   3. The relationships and actions between the characters aren't really believable.  4. A lot of this film is forced and cliche; For instance, the \\"running around with my gal and having fun\\" montage. Or the man who is haunted by his past, and is slow to open up.  5. More than anything, the film tries to be serious at times, and tackle the issues of mental illness, but then it tries to be fun and quirky at other times. I think the two sides can exist in a movie, but it wasn't pulled off well in this move.     Save your time and money, and skip this movie.
B002HK9IDQ|4.0|Great cast, great production, one of my all time favorites.  Costumes were wonderfully flamboyant at the \\"Regatta\\", music and acting top notch.
B003O85W3A|5.0|You need to listen to CD about 4-5 times before songs get to your mind, and then you can't stop listening to them. It is one of the rare music that gets better and better with time. Not super catchy, with soft voice and drums, but the atmosphere and lyrics make it extremely powerful. I love the subject of the suburbs and wasted times, because it brings me back to my childhood and simpler times. All songs are worthwhile, not a single one to skip, but best are \\"City with no children\\", \\"half light\\", \\"used to wait\\", \\"sprawl II\\" (her voice is really something). A must have!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I´m, not going to lie, i liked 19 better, but i think this album is an aquired taste, each time i listen it i like it more. I am not a pro giving reviews, but this is what i think, besides i saw another review where it said the sound of the cd was not good, i do not agree with that.
030746363X|5.0|The book was very insight full. I have not lost weight, but I am replacing body fat with muscle.  No complaints.  The Author is a nut.  Do what you can based on your limits, I have no desire to maximize results in the manner he did.<br />Other wise this is a recommended read for any man.
B002NPUCIA|4.0|I have heard Brian Culbertson on the smooth jazz stations and his music just sort of blended in with ths rest of the genre.  After seeing his creative process in this well done DVD I have a greater appreciation for his music and craft.  Highly recommended for those who like their smooth jazz with a helping of funk and r&b.
B001AQIYJC|5.0|This didn't feel so much like a movie as a major wake-up call to life, with this message: Cut out what doesn't matter, and live fully. We're all a little bit angel, and we need to start living that way.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|The subject was an interesting one to me, so I wasn't surprised that I enjoyed Moonwalking With Einstein.  What did surprise me was how hard it was to put it down.  I found Foer's writing style really entertaining, and the trip through the science of memory, history of mnemonics, and his exploration of the world of memory competitions just flew by.    It's not often that I'm sad a non-fiction work reaches its conclusion, but I was in this case.  Great book!
B0040QYROK|5.0|Alloy Orchestra and the best way to see Metropolis<br /><br />The first movie scored by the Alloy Orchestra was Metropolis, and for years they performed that score live with showings of the Giorgio Moroder restoration of the film that was released in the 1980s.  They also recorded that score on a 2 CD set and it can be synced up with the Moroder version very nicely (start the music when the introductory text first appears in the black box before the Metropolis title appears).<br /><br />For the US Premiere of the complete version of Metropolis that appears on this Blu ray disc (and DVD), the Alloy Orchestra was asked update and lengthen the score and perform it at the TCM festival in 2010.  They did and they have also recorded that score in 24 bit 48 khz high resolution sound; the plan was to include it on the Kino Blu ray, but as you can read in one of the other reviews, that didn't happen.  But Alloy Orchestra is selling an mp3 CD of the score (and directions for synchronizing it to the movie) on their website (google them by name).  Having seen Metropolis with the recorded original score and also with the Alloy Orchestra performing live, I would say there is no contest.  I would never chose to watch it again without the Alloy Orchestra score, but I do plan to show it to friends in my home theatre with the Alloy Orchestra score more than once.<br /><br />If you choose to order the Alloy Orchestra score, you might want to inquire about getting better quality sound than the mp3 CD.  It was recorded in high resolution sound and if there are enough requests, they might be persuaded to release it as a high resolution sound audio DVD, to play along with your Blu ray of the movie on a separate player or from your computer.<br /><br />Alloy Orchestra has also composed numerous other scores for silent movies and a number of them are available as the soundtrack or as an alternative soundtrack on DVDs of the films.  They are all highly recommended
B000F8DB4O|4.0|The sounds on this 1995 Pat Metheny Group album are a snapshot of many different musical genres.  With the exception of \\"Episode d'Azur,\\" a Lyle Mays composition, all the songs were written by Metheny and Mays, and represent the styles and elements of the industry.  Hip-hop, jazz, funk, rock, pop, be-bop, reggae, grunge, soul, acid, aternative, fusion, electronica, and so much more, all rolled together in that distinctive Metheny Group sound.  There's plenty of impovisation and freeform experimental colors thrown in to keep the listener happy.  It's all upbeat, fun, and very cool.  Sure, some of the tracks skirt the edge of commercialism a little too often, but that's the point.  We live here, and this is the sounds of the world around us.  Recommended.
0756404738|3.0|I loved Name of the Wind and nearly slagged down my Kindle turning pages.  As I read Wise Man's Fear, however, I was lacking the sense of urgency that had me obsessed with NOTW - and I think it was because Patrick Rothfuss and his hero, Kvothe, didn't seem to have it either.  By the middle of the book I was getting the very clear message that this book did not have a hero's destination.  Kvothe was wandering as was my attention.  When the author introduces a new character in a way that inbues them with importance and weight and then never mentions them again in a 1000 page book the message he is sending is that all the good stuff will come in book three.  Unfortunately, if Patrick is going to tie up all the threads that are dangling in the wind with the attention to detail that he has shown so far we have to expect a 2500 page third book in the trilogy - and on the pace demonstrated by NOTW to WMF that won't happen for 8 years.        Patrick Rothfuss is a wonderful shaper of words and in Kvothe, Sim, Wil, Fela. Denna and Devi ....and Auri.....he has introduced me to people that i care about and created fully realized 3-D personalities that don't remain on the page but inhabit my thoughts.  If NOTW was 4 stars. this is perhaps 2.5 stars.  I recommend it unreservedly but don't expect another NOTW when you do.
B002ZG981E|1.0|I waisted my money and time on this purchase. No picture to watch and no audio sound to hear the movie.
B003Y5H53S|4.0|well this movie did honestly surprise me. i had the feeling it would be good, but not as good as it really was. the only thing that would have made it better is if they had gotten clint eastwood in it. oh well, you can't have everything. a great story for those who find themselves asking \\"who am i?\\" this isn't a movie that i would suggest to someone who has no sense of humor cause there are a lot of jokes in there. all good ones. i also would not recommend this movie to children under the age of 8 due to some violence and language. it's mainly gun play that plays it's part in it. the music is great. especially at one point were blue grass and classical mix. though nothing is perfect. the mystery was predictable as were some of the twists and such. but then again i've been watching movies forever. all in all i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes seeing an idiot looking like one in different ways than one and small jokes here and there. also keep an eye out for another depp movie reference. you'll know it when you see it.
B002JTHFV2|4.0|When U2 released \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" in 1984, I didn't much care for it.  And neither did many of the fans and critics who had loved every track off the \\"War\\" album the previous year.  Compared to \\"War,\\" \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" felt rushed, overly dramatic, and unfinished.  I didn't listen to it a whole lot.  Sure, \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\" and \\"Pride\\" were great songs, and typical of the rock arena sound I had come to expect from Dublin's greatest rock band, but the rest of the album fell flat.  To be ironic, it was forgettable.    It is to my amazement now that the deluxe re-issue of this CD is so incredibly enjoyable.  The original CD has been re-mastered and sounds fantastic.  It's crisp and clear, and Adam Clayton's bass is no longer buried under the muddled \\"treatments\\" of the producers.  The real treat here, however, is the Bonus Audio CD, which contains the original \\"Wide Awake In America\\" EP, as well as so many other great tracks that I'm left wondering why the band chose the songs they did for the original album.  Any of the B-Sides or Remixes from this Bonus CD would have been better than \\"Promenade\\" or \\"Elvis Presley and America.\\"    In addition, the full lyrics to all the original songs are reproduced here.  (The original vinyl album only printed lyrics to \\"A Sort of Homecoming.\\")  The CD booklet also contains some terrific photos of the band, and - believe it or not - they're not all blurry the way Anton Corbijn typically presents U2.  A series of commentaries by Brian Eno, Daniel Lanois, U2 biographer Bert van de Kamp, and The Edge round out the CD package.    Highly recommended for anyone who owns the original \\"Unforgettable Fire.\\"
B0043ISH6O|2.0|I'm very disappointed this score was awarded an Oscar for best original score. There are a very lovely themes but some of the tracks are incredibly monotonous. I guess the score won purely because of Trent Reznor's name. John Powell's score for How to Train Your Dragon was much better. But the worst song by Randy Newman also won this year so I'm beginning to think Oscar voters don't even listen to the music nominees. I wish I could get a refund.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I only just discovered this little jewel of a miniseries as a streaming video on NF. Previously, Pride & Prejudice (1995) was the miniseries I held above all others, but North & South is just extraordinary. It has a richer, more gritty backdrop than P&P and the romance (though similar in arc) is more realistic and sensual. Daniela Denby-Ashe & Richard Armitage give perfect, passionate performances and the supporting cast is wonderful as well. And the music! I'm sorry to hear that there is no soundtrack available for purchase, because this score is truly powerful and epic. Just a brilliant production in every way. I bought the DVD only a few days later after watching three times. The story is so compelling that it's easy to watch in one sitting. If you love BBC Historical/Literature based dramas, you will love this miniseries.
B000002KIE|5.0|Yes, I admit, the Sex Pistols are a bit overrated generally speaking especially since they only released one album, but that one album is the iconic album of punk rock along with the Ramones first album.  The Clash don't belong in that conversation, they are hardly punk rock to me, and like Kurt Cobain said, \\"The Sex Pistols were a million times more important to punk rock than the Clash were!\\"  Many people seem to want to criticize the Pistols as only being about image and fashion, and while that is definitely true to a certain degree, their music was very good so I think most people are able to overlook that!  Johnny Rotten and Sid Vicious were surely trying to shock people, but who really cares if the music is good!  The big mistake that they made was obviously firing Glen Matlock (the real musician in the band along with Steve Jones) and replacing him with the very punk rock looking Sid Vicious, who by all accounts could hardly play the bass when he joined the band and not much better by the time they were touring!    Now to the album!  I completely disagree with the Amazon reviewer saying that the rest of the album was only a tenth as good as the singles were, that is rubbish, the whole album plays through beautifully and every song is good!  Yes, the singles standout, but if not for the hype behind them they may not have stood out quite so much!  \\"Bodies\\" and \\"No Feeling\\" are just as classic as the singles are!  \\"Holidays in the Sun\\" is a brilliant opener with a marching drum beat intro that gives way the brilliant, yet simple guitar work of Steve Jones and just as brilliant bass work by Glen Matlock!  Glen Matlock wrote very catchy and infectious bass lines throughout the album, and I believe the only song that Sid actually played bass on was \\"Bodies\\" so Matlock is the true bassist along with Steve Jones who also played a lot of the bass parts on the album because Sid couldn't do it!  \\"Bodies\\" seems to be some sort of anti-abortion song and is probably the hardest hitting song on the album with a very catchy, melodic chorus (yes Johnny Rotten could sing a little bit when he wanted to), lots of swearing and overall this is definitely one of the Sex Pistols best songs!  \\"No Feelings\\" is a song about being selfish and not feeling one bit bad for it, this is a fun song with a great chorus once again!  \\"Liar\\" starts off slowly and builds up with cool bass work and simple drum beat and has a really \\"PUNK\\" breakdown right in the middle of the song, you'll know what I mean when you hear it, and it is the highlight of the song!  \\"Problems\\" is one of the weaker songs on the album, and has a bit more of a classic rock n' roll feel than most of the album, also one of the longer songs as well, with a pretty cool guitar solo halfway through, Steve Jones was a very tight guitar player.  \\"God Save the Queen\\" is probably their best known song besides \\"Anarchy in the U.K.\\" and it is definitely a brilliant song, the guitar work is definitely what stands out most about the song followed by Johnny Rottens cocky, obnoxious, yet infectious vocals.  The guitar work in this song is what should be in the dictionary when talking about punk rock guitar(ing) along with Johnny Ramone of course (the first true punk rock guitarist), as these riffs and the solo have been played millions of times by different punk rock bands(in their own songs) since this came out!      \\"Seventeen\\" is another of the less popular Pistols songs, but is actually a very good song, and is somewhat more poppy than most of the album, with the chorus, \\"Im a lazy sod, Im a lazy sod, Im a lazy sod, Im so lazy.\\"  \\"Anarchy in the U.K.\\" really needs no description if you listen to punk rock, as it is often listed as the greatest punk rock song of all-time or at least one of the best!  If you can find the demo version of the song, it is even better than this album version, much rawer and more punk!  The song is menacing mostly because of Rottens vox, but also has a strong pop sensibility, and is still an anarchist anthem to this day as the U.K. reference could be replaced by any capitalist country in the world, especially western countries!  \\"Sub-Mission\\" is the slowest song on the album and has a more classic rock sound than punk rock sound!  Probably the least favorite of most people and definitely my least favorite on the album, although it did show some sound diversity by the band, and who knows what this band may have been if they didn't fire Glen Matlock!  \\"Pretty Vacant\\" is another of the most popular Pistols songs and I believe it was the third single from the album, and it is definitely a fan favorite.  The song builds from a soft guitar riff into one of the hardest songs on the album, as well as one of the most melodic, with a great chorus of Johnny singing, \\"Were so Pretty, oh so pretty ahhhhh, vacant, were so pretty oh so pretty, we're vacant, were so pretty oh so pretty ahhh, and now, and we dont care.\\"  And when Rotten sings Vacant, he says it like VaCUNT!  \\"New York\\" almost sounds like post-punk or alternative rock, and really sounds a bit ahead of its time!  It is definitely a highlight and I believe it is about the band the New York Dolls, who Malcolm McLaren managed before the Pistols, and Johnny Rotten kind of makes fun of the NY Dolls especially singer David Johannsen, calling him a \\"faggot\\" and a phony!  The funny thing is that the Sex Pistols probably wouldn't have ever been a band without the New York Dolls as they are one of the best and most influential protopunk bands.  The album ends with \\"EMI\\" on a very high note, as it is another of the best songs they ever did!  And it concludes one of the very best punk rock albums ever made!      I highly recommend this album!  And if you like this album I would recommend the Ramones first four albums, The Dead Boys \\"Young, Loud, and Snotty\\", the Misfits \\"Static Age\\" and \\"Walk Among Us\\", and probably the Clash's first album (their only punk rock album)!  And for a modern band with this type of sound check out the U.S. Bombs, a modern punk rock band with a late 70's punk rock sound, they are very cool!
0226264211|5.0|This classic, written by one of the founding fathers of modern economy discusses \\"competitive capitalism\\". As Milton explains it is: \\"The organization of the bulk of economic activity through private enterprise operating in a free market - as a system of economic freedom and a necessary condition for political freedom.\\" In doing so, he addresses the role that the government should and needs to play in such an economic system - a minor role (in comparison to today's role) - that relies on the free market to organize economic activity.<br /><br />In this context, Milton goes on to discuss the following: The Relation between Economic Freedom and Political Freedom, The Role of Government In a Free Society, The Control of Money, International Financial and Trade Arrangements, Fiscal Policy, The Role of Government In Education, Capitalism and Discrimination, Monopoly and the Social Responsibility of Business and Labor, Occupational Licensure, The Distribution of Income, Social Welfare Measures and Alleviation of Poverty.<br /><br />What distinguishes this books in the mix of theory and abstract concepts, with the real-life applications and implications. The arguments presented are objective and rational, and defy a lot of the conventional and political wisdom. This is despite the fact that a number of these topics are \\"hot\\" political/social debate items such as social security. Milton discusses in depth how such items can be addressed within the competitive capitalism framework, the bigger role the private sector can play, and a retraction in the role of government.<br /><br />A truly timeless classic, and a must read for anyone interested in the field of economics, the interlude between politics and economics, and liberalism. Highly recommended![...]
B000SINT52|3.0|I like the topics Michael chooses but I sometimes think he's in it for the money. Some conservatives created a counter to this movie entitled FahreNYPE 9/11. I watched that too. It shows Democrats also hanging out with middle easterners in flowing robes and hoods. Michael Moorer made it sound like it was all conservatives doing that. You know guilt by association.   Then Michael asks congress people if they have any sons or daughters in the armed forces, tyring to make a point that if they did they wouldn't vote to send then to die in Iraq. When one congress person tried to explain that he did have children in the armed forces his mike was cut since that didn't help the story line.   In this movie, George Bush is shown speaking to a crowd saying something like \\"You are my people/base.\\" Made Bush look like he was an elitist hanging with other elitists. In the Farenhype counter movie they show how Moorer took this speech completely out of context. They don't show Bush leaving the podium and going to sit down right next to Al Gore. Al Gore and Geroge Bush were at the same meeting.   Please Michael Moorer you don't need to lie or fabricate. Just tell the truth. The facts are strong enough. This doesn't take away completely that there is much good in this movie.
B004FDY4LE|5.0|The end comes to the first season in this nice little piece of episode six. Also, there is commentary that cna be gotten to go with this for free, making everything understood. The group has trekked for a while and has gotten to what they think is a safe place, right outside of zombie reach. This leads them to feel like they are in fgood hands, and it leads to a time of rest. The only problem with that is not asking the right questions, and questions are always good things.<br /><br />As the season ends, you expect a lot fo the undead to rear their heads. That is not the point of this season, however, and good things happen in the human part of the drama. Good acting comes forth, some motion pushes people on, and some of the cast dies out in a turn that makes the cast keep moving.<br /><br />I liked the way everything ended and it makes sense to go this route. I origianlly downloaded this and the episodes that goes with it, and I think they go good together. It talks about the direciton and it had some commentary with the cast, making some interesting observations. This is a 5/5 way to go with the first piece of the human/ undead experience.
B004LQI0HE|1.0|Visually Great, acting solid-story is flat out stupid.  The problem is the whole idea that clones would be treated worse than cattle is such a flimsy idea unsupported in any way the whole pile of garbage falls on itself.  The technical aspects of how the cloning works, how they are raised and act leaves too many holes.  The only reason there are good reviews is people love the author--no way this story stands on its own--it's bad Jr High sci-fi.
B004I2K4DY|4.0|For those who are new to LM, and even for those who have followed it from the beginning, this is a good addition to the library. Very enjoyable, and as mentioned everyone gives a very good performance, with special shout out to Alfie Boe; gives Colm Wilkinson a run for his money; well done. Nick Jonas is obviously miscast and way out of his league, but not as bad as some reviewers state. Also like Salonga better as Eponine. The encore, with the 4 Valjean's and other members of the original cast such as the great Michael Ball, is nothing short of fantastic. Having said that...........as good as this is, if you don't already own it, go out and buy the 10th Anniversary DVD. The 25th is very good, but the 10th was just flat out Great and superior in every way IMHO. Nothing negative on the 25th, it's just there is a difference between being very good and being great. And the 10th is GREAT. Either way, enjoyed this version.
B0039208JE|3.0|The first big budget Batman film with Michael Keaton was a very well done film and, if you don't own a copy, by all means the blu ray is worth picking up. The movie has held up well since its 1989 release --- but this blu ray release of it was very obviously a rush job. The video transfer is alright and looks nice and sharp - but the sound mix is abysmal...the sound mix here does NOT take advantage of a 5.1 speaker set-up. 99% of the sound is right out of your front right and left speakers. Don't come in expecting a nice surround sound to pull you in - you're going to be sorely disappointed. Additionally, there's not really a main menu...no chapter selection option, no set-up options for sound or video optimizations. Go to the menu and you pretty much are given options for the additional special features. Overall, this is just an 'okay' version of this film (the sound quality is really a big let down), and given the quality of today's home theater setups - is a bit of a disappointment. However, having said that - it's a great film, and if you don't have a copy - this is still your best bet.
B003HYNB34|5.0|The new Dcotor, regenerating, finds himself outside of a home and not exactly leaping through the world with time-defying wisodm. This seems odd to him as he tries to link up with a little girl, who has a crack in her wall and who has a nack for waiting for a man she barely knows. The Dcotor is nothing if not a man of his word, however, and things step off rather well as the two of them find out many things - including what frozen fish and custard taste like.<br /><br />This season seems a bit odd, and not just because of the change-up. It is also because of the housecleaning Who is enduring, because the Dr. annd the staffing are new. When I say new I mean new, too, with everyone seemingly falling through the cracks and revamping the season. Perhaps that is a good thing, too, because it might have a happy way to it.<br /><br />While Matt Smith is a relative unknown when it comes to the world of Dr. Who, he is a powerhouse when it comes to filling those shoes right off the bat. This is not to say that the last doctor will not be missed because that  is far from the truth. Still, he was looked at with a bit of oddity when he took over, and look at the reaction that people had when they talked about the thing starting over. The new Doctor Who and Amy Pond turn out to be quite the group, too, reminding me of a companion and a doctor that I knew and grew to love. Not only are they in for a run that will lead them to Stonehenge and back, but they are also in for something that will show them exactly what a crack can lead to when you are dealing with The Doctor.<br /><br />As far as the episodes go, this is a good one. It has a nice way about it, and the introductions are good. This leads to long-lasting friends and some other goodies, making us all wonder if the Doctor and amy Pond will be together for a while to come.
B003Y58CKS|5.0|Verdi's Rigoletto is the opera that turned me, many years ago, into a severe opera fan.  It was the first opera recording that I owned plus it was the first live production of an opera that I ever witnessed.   Throughout the years I have heard and witnessed many, many performances of Rigoletto because it truly is a favorite opera of mine.  Therefore, upon listening and viewing this 2008 performance from Sachsische Staatskapelle Dresden, I required a short time to adjust especially to the \\"modern\\" production of the opera that is on this DVD.  After I allowed myself to adjust to this minimalistic staging and, more or less, modern dress, I found myself really enjoying this rather stark production.  As far as the musical sides of things were concerned, there were far less need for any adjustment on my part because almost instantaneously I found the singing and orchestra playing to be marvelous.      Diana Damrau sings spectacularly as Gilda.  She has it all-wonderful  coloratura, easy lovely high notes, a nice full middle register with the ability to phrase wonderfully, lovely trills and she acts very believability portraying a Gilda  with just the right amount of vulnerability that's not too sticky sweet for after all she is willing to  die for her man.   I enjoyed her very much.  Zeljko Lucic as Rigoletto sings sonorously well able to meet all of the vocal challenges that Verdi throws at him and acting the tormented, guilt ridden and full of secrets character of Rigoletto so very well.   I was a little afraid for Juan Florez's singing of the Duke mainly because I had only previously heard him \\"do\\" Rossini; however,   he brushed my fears aside very quickly singing a Duke with ease of high notes and the ability to negotiate the coloratura passages splendidly.  Plus his portrayal of a \\"rake\\" was very good.  I also loved the bosomy Maddalena of Christa Mayer. In fact, all of the secondary roles are done very well.      The orchestra is greatly led by Fabio Luisi whose approach is very lyrical and dramatic.  The chorus sounds so wonderful and very much in tune.  I really enjoyed this performance of a favorite opera.
B004G600A4|3.0|It's about a girl whose mother for 18 years dies and she runs off with a thief and lives happily ever after with the king and queen.    The movie is brilliantly produced, but the story is a little flawed. Your mother for 18 years falls off the tower and dies, and you don't even shed a tear. I'm not sure what sort of message Disney is trying to portray with this one, but thieves are better than mothers .. hmmmm!
1416583432|4.0|This book is very informative and not for those who want a light book to read. It has scientific facts about dogs and comparisions to other animals. It is a real eye-opener about the things we were taught about dogs as we grew up and even as adults. It's a good book all about dogs.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am not a workout dvd person.  I workout on a daily basis: weight lifting class 3 times per week and do the elliptical 3 times per week for an hour each.  I bought this DVD long time ago and never opened it.  I decided that I was going to add different exercise to my routine so I decided to start running and trying out this DVD.  This is a tough workout!  I bought 8-lb weights and tried it, I was amazed by how hard it was.  The next day I had to go back and buy 3-lb and 5-lb weights, I just could not do most exercises with the 8lb weights.  I haven't even tried the 2nd or 3rd level.  I would suggest having different size weights, I end up using them all throughout the workout.  I am looking forward to trying the other levels!
B003EYVY04|5.0|The box for the Ultimate Edition of Prisoner of Azkaban is not as sturdy as the boxes for the Ultimate Editions of Years 1 & 2. Year 3's box is flimsier, and there's an added shell with a holographic image of the poster on the front. The movie is not an extended version, which I have heard that many other people are not happy about. I don't really care, I liked the extended editions of Years 1 & 2, but I didn't buy this for the extended edition. I'll watch the deleted scenes, that will be fine for me. I bought this for all of the extra, behind-the-scenes footage and documentaries.    So if you really care about seeing the extended movie, this isn't for you. If you're really into behind-the-scenes stuff & seeing how parts of the movies came to be, then it's totally worth the money.
8862931921|5.0|I sincerely appreciate the quality of Moleskine products.  You should know what you are getting if you purchase one.  They are light weight and the paper tends to be of good quality, but is mildly see through.  If you want to use both sides, I would suggest pencil.  I personally write in Pilot G2 .5 pens and they do not bleed through, but can be seen through the paper.  I tend to use only one side for this reason, but bought the item for this.  I use it as a creative outlet, for drawing and writing, and the A4 size paper, I believe 8x12, allows room for that expression.    Great functionality, again, the only drawback is the paper thickness, but it's part of what makes for the lightweight construction.  It's a give and take, just know what to expect when you get yours.  Recommended.

0618918248|1.0|Below is a quick, concise refutation that philosopher William Lane Craig wrote:        Richard Dawkins has emerged as the enfant terrible of the movement known as the New Atheism. His best-selling book The God Delusion has become the literary centerpiece of that movement. In it Dawkins aims to show that belief in God is a delusion, that is to say, \\"a false belief or impression,\\" or worse, \\"a persistent false belief held in the face of strong contradictory evidence.\\"1 On pages 157-8 of his book, Dawkins summarizes what he calls \\"the central argument of my book.\\" Note it well. If this argument fails, then Dawkins' book is hollow at its core. And, in fact, the argument is embarrassingly weak.    It goes as follows:    1. One of the greatest challenges to the human intellect has been to explain how the complex, improbable appearance of design in the universe arises.    2. The natural temptation is to attribute the appearance of design to actual design itself.    3. The temptation is a false one because the designer hypothesis immediately raises the larger problem of who designed the designer.    4. The most ingenious and powerful explanation is Darwinian evolution by natural selection.    5. We don't have an equivalent explanation for physics.    6. We should not give up the hope of a better explanation arising in physics, something as powerful as Darwinism is for biology.    Therefore, God almost certainly does not exist.    This argument is jarring because the atheistic conclusion that \\"Therefore, God almost certainly does not exist\\" seems to come suddenly out of left field. You don't need to be a philosopher to realize that that conclusion doesn't follow from the six previous statements.    Indeed, if we take these six statements as premises of an argument intended to logically imply the conclusion \\"Therefore, God almost certainly does not exist,\\" then the argument is patently invalid. No logical rules of inference would permit you to draw this conclusion from the six premises.    A more charitable interpretation would be to take these six statements, not as premises, but as summary statements of six steps in Dawkins' cumulative argument for his conclusion that God does not exist. But even on this charitable construal, the conclusion \\"Therefore, God almost certainly does not exist\\" simply doesn't follow from these six steps, even if we concede that each of them is true and justified. The only delusion demonstrated here is Dawkins' conviction that this is \\"a very serious argument against God's existence.\\"2    So what does follow from the six steps of Dawkins' argument? At most, all that follows is that we should not infer God's existence on the basis of the appearance of design in the universe. But that conclusion is quite compatible with God's existence and even with our justifiably believing in God's existence. Maybe we should believe in God on the basis of the cosmological argument or the ontological argument or the moral argument. Maybe our belief in God isn't based on arguments at all but is grounded in religious experience or in divine revelation. Maybe God wants us to believe in him simply by faith. The point is that rejecting design arguments for God's existence does nothing to prove that God does not exist or even that belief in God is unjustified. Indeed, many Christian theologians have rejected arguments for the existence of God without thereby committing themselves to atheism.    So Dawkins' argument for atheism is a failure even if we concede, for the sake of argument, all its steps. But, in fact, several of these steps are plausibly false in any case. Take just step (3), for example. Dawkins' claim here is that one is not justified in inferring design as the best explanation of the complex order of the universe because then a new problem arises: Who designed the designer?    This objection is flawed on at least two counts.    First, in order to recognize an explanation as the best, one needn't have an explanation of the explanation. This is an elementary point concerning inference to the best explanation as practiced in the philosophy of science. If archaeologists digging in the earth were to discover things looking like arrowheads and hatchet heads and pottery shards, they would be justified in inferring that these artifacts are not the chance result of sedimentation and metamorphosis, but products of some unknown group of people, even though they had no explanation of who these people were or where they came from. Similarly, if astronauts were to come upon a pile of machinery on the back side of the moon, they would be justified in inferring that it was the product of intelligent, extra-terrestrial agents, even if they had no idea whatsoever who these extra-terrestrial agents were or how they got there.    In order to recognize an explanation as the best, one needn't be able to explain the explanation. In fact, so requiring would lead to an infinite regress of explanations, so that nothing could ever be explained and science would be destroyed. So in the case at hand, in order to recognize that intelligent design is the best explanation of the appearance of design in the universe, one needn't be able to explain the designer.    Second, Dawkins thinks that in the case of a divine designer of the universe, the designer is just as complex as the thing to be explained, so that no explanatory advance is made. This objection raises all sorts of questions about the role played by simplicity in assessing competing explanations--for example, how simplicity is to be weighted in comparison with other criteria like explanatory power, explanatory scope, plausibility, and so forth. If a less simple hypothesis exceeds its rivals in explanatory scope and power, for example, then it may well be the preferred explanation, despite the sacrifice in simplicity.    But leave those questions aside. Dawkins' fundamental mistake lies in his assumption that a divine designer is an entity comparablein complexity to the universe. As an unembodied mind, God is a remarkably simple entity. As a non-physical entity, a mind is not composed of parts, and its salient properties, like self-consciousness, rationality, and volition, are essential to it. In contrast to the contingent and variegated universe with all its inexplicable physical quantities and constants (mentioned in the fifth step of Dawkins' argument),3 a divine mind is startlingly simple. Certainly such a mind may have complex ideas (it may be thinking, for example, of the infinitesimal calculus), but the mind itself is a remarkably simple entity. Dawkins has evidently confused a mind's ideas, which may, indeed, be complex, with a mind itself, which is an incredibly simple entity.4 Therefore, postulating a divine mind behind the universe most definitely does represent an advance in simplicity, for whatever that's worth.    Other steps in Dawkins' argument are also problematic; but I think enough has been said to show that his argument does nothing to undermine a design inference based on the universe's complexity, not to speak of its serving as a justification of atheism.    Several years ago my atheist colleague Quentin Smith unceremoniously crowned Stephen Hawking's argument against God in A Brief History of Time as \\"the worst atheistic argument in the history of Western thought.\\"5 With the advent of The God Delusion the time has come, I think, to relieve Hawking of this weighty crown and to recognize Richard Dawkins' accession to the throne.

0385737955|3.0|Really great idea for a story. After reading it I'm still a little curious about the 2nd book. But there wasn't much character development and the author is hardly descriptive of the environment either. Like I said, good story idea but it didn't really get interesting until half way through. That's because I believe it's around this time that the main character, Thomas, finally starts to learn some solid information about his surroundings. Up until this point whenever he asked a reasonable question, the boys around him (who behaved reasonably otherwise) would yell at him for being so stupid and would tell him that he should just shut his mouth because he doesn't know anything.  SO ANNOYING!! I guess this was the author's way of keeping aspects of the story a mystery... but it was so annoying that I almost put the book away.    I realize that this was written for kids and I am an adult, so take my review with a grain of salt. I just read the Hunger Games trilogy and was looking for a similar read. This book definitely seemed a little less sophisticated.

030726999X|5.0|The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest is a wonderful end to Steig Larsson's compellng Dragon Tattoo trilogy.  This novel starts out right where The Girl Who Played With Fire finishes, so I would recommend to readers that they actually begin with The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo first.  For readers who have read the first two of this series, the novel will not disappoint.  Larsson gives us his usual slow build.  One of the things I like about his three novels, and this one is no exception, that within each novel there are smaller mystery arcs.  These arcs make for an entertaining and compelling read.  I am sorry to see the trilogy finish--for those readers who have not started, you are in for a treat.  Enjoy!
0765318741|4.0|I only read I am Legend and not the ten short stories that follow in this edition of the book, so my review will only be of the one story I read and not the book as a whole.<br /><br />I am Legend is considered by many as a classic horror story. I previously saw the movie adaptation starring Will Smith and let me warn you now, that movie is nothing like the book. It was very strange seeing Will Smith on the cover of this book while reading about Robert Neville who is very different, physically and mentally than the character Smith portrayed.<br /><br />I am Legend is a not-sexy vampire book, closer to Salem's Lot (King calls I am Legend an inspiration for him) than the plethora of vampire romances today. Robert Neville is the only real focus of the book, being the last remaining non-vampire in the world. We see what he does all day, what he remembers of the past and his attempts to figure out a cure. The vampires are scary, but scarier still is the utter aloneness Neville lives with and his desperation to have someone to share this hell with.<br /><br />I really thought I knew where this story was going, but the last third of the book really shocked me. Having seen the movie did nothing to warn me of what was to come as the book and movie are so vastly different. I found the book to be scarier, but the movie was slightly more entertaining if it's really fair to compare them at all. I am Legend is a must read classic vampire tale with nothing in common with its movie adaptation.

B00008G7UF|2.0|I am an avid video collector and have recently pared my collection of about 1,000 videos down to a more manageable 450 and have replaced many of my retained VHS releases with DVDs. I also have a big screen Samsung HD TV (beautiful picture quality) and enjoy my videos on that bigger wide angle screen.  For sound, I have a Bose home theatre system ... got it all ... but I HATE 2.35 aspect ratio films ... the video producers give you the hype that you see the total width of the image, but I have still yet to see a picture that I would have been upset about if it were done in anamorphic 1.85 or straight 1.33.  Bottom line, the new DVD (this product) of French Kiss is done in a 2.35 aspect ratio ... but the bars are so thick/wide and the picture is so small, that you need a magnifying glass to enjoy it ... THEY WRECKED THIS MOVIE with the 2.35 presentation ... Thank goodness I saved my VHS copy, which shows full screen on my HD TV but not with digital clarity of DVD/HD.  I'll keep it because it only cost a few bucks, but this is another way of manufacturers ruining a good thing and telling you to take what they give you.  If you have to have this movie, buy it ... but if not, don't frustrate yourself. For me, it's too bad, as this is one of my favorite movies.

B0041KKYD8|5.0|When I got this movie I kind of knew what I was in for, cause I had seen the original 1987 Version...   But even having SEEN the original didn't mean I was PREPARED for this take on the story....   If you have seen the original and thought the killings were rather Shocking, then you may not be ready for this Incarnation of this rather Tough Story...   However if you saw the original and wanted to see MORE, or see something a little more....    Brutal...   Then this is your movie...   It does take a rather Special type of person to get into this movie though, cause some of the murders are Very Viscious, and In Your Face...   Fish Hooks, Lye, then there is also the Shotgun Scene...   Trust me there is alot that will make you So Very Uneasy...    And even a couple things that will be worse for MEN to watch than others...   Believe me...   Now horror movies don't bother me, but I had to stop it at a couple times before I could get all the way through it...    I have to say that the director's choice to add a Sheriff into the mix of the Perpetrators is enough to make you a little uneasy, cause when you see a cop on screen in a movie it gives you a \\"Safe Place\\" that you can retreat to and say \\"Everything is going to be alright.  The Police are there\\", but that isn't the case in this movie, Believe me...   The director choosing to do this adds an even more Intense feeling to this movie...   If you have Nerves of Steel, a Strong Stomach then you may really enjoy this movie...   Just don't think you are heading in to a Totally Pleasent Movie...   However if you have read the Description then you know it isn't Pleasent...

B004JMZPJG|3.0|இ Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:<br />ѾѾѾ Somewhat recommended, with reservations and only lukewarm fuzzies.<br /><br />I love using SLR camera holster bags like this for shorter day outings where I do not want to be weighed down more by the bulk of a larger shoulder camera bag, camera backpack, or camera sling bag.  As long as you are not needing to carry multiple camera bodies or lenses, camera holsters are perfect for shoot-and-scoot situations like walking tours of a city, hiking in the woods or mountains, and social gatherings with family or friends.<br /><br />This is a very basic camera holster in very crowded price range filled with better options.  The primary reason that I rated this holster only 3 stars is that, in the $20-$30 price range, there are better offerings from Case Logic, Lowepro, and Tamrac, among others.  This is a nicely made holster.  But once you also consider the other holster options in this price range, this holster looks to be fairly \\"average\\".  With internal dimensions of 5.7\\"x4.6\\"x6.25\\", I can snugly fit my Canon 7D and 17-55mm f/2.8 lens (without a battery grip, but with a tripod plate attached).  So your non-full-frame SLR camera will likely fit inside this, unless you are using a battery grip or require it to hold a 70-200mm lens.  There are two zippered pockets on each side of the holster, and another zippered pocket on the inside of the zippered lid.  The padding around all sides of this holster is adequate and comparable to other camera holsters.  The bottom of the holster is padded thicker than the sides, and that is a good thing since the bulk of the camera weight may be resting on it.<br /><br />All zippers and stitching are high quality.  But the top grab handle is only secured with one line of stitching on each side, and I think that the stitching of this top grab handle could become loose over time with repeated grabbing and lifting by that handle.<br /><br />The holster comes with a very basic 1-inch wide unpadded shoulder strap.  A simple unpadded shoulder strap like this is fine for carrying a compact SLR or point-and-shoot camera.  But it becomes more uncomfortable on your shoulder when carrying around a larger, heavier SLR camera for extended periods.  This lack of padding and rubbing of the strap can be especially apparent if you are just wearing a thin shirt, blouse, or t-shirt.<br /><br />The shoulder strap uses plastic clips that secure to the holster's plastic D-rings.  While I prefer metal D-rings instead of plastic D-rings for durability, I really dislike these kinds of plastic clips when used on a holster like this where you may be frequently clipping and unclipping the shoulder strap, depending upon whether you want to attach the holster to your belt or sling it around your shoulder.  Over time, the plastic clip can fatigue and bend or break with repeated use by pressing down on the plastic.  This will not be an issue if you always leave the shoulder strap attached to the holster, but it is something to consider.<br /><br />Within this price range and staying with the Case Logic brand, I think that their [[ASIN:B001TZUS98 Caselogic SLRC-201 SLR Zoom Holster (Black)]] is a far better holster than this one.  It has a larger internal dimensions of 6.3\\"x4.7\\"x6.9\\" than this holster, and includes a shoulder strap that is generously padded around your shoulder.  But on that holster, even though I like its shoulder strap clips better than the totally plastic clips used on this holster, its shoulder strap clips onto fabric loops instead of metal or plastic D-rings.  I prefer D-rings over a fabric loop for clipping a shoulder strap onto.<br /><br />Within this price range and looking at other competing products, you should also consider the Lowepro \\"Toploader Zoom\\" line of holsters.  I like their designs better than this holster because they offer more useful storage pockets, and their \\"AW\\" All-Weather models come with a rain cover that fully protects the holster in case it rains.You will get a temporary amount of rain protection using this Case Logic holster (e.g. for darting across parking lots during a heavy rain), but the water will soak through the zippers and seams.  Some people do not think about how rainproof their camera case will be... until they get caught out in the open during a torrential downpour.  To protect my investment in three camera bodies and seven lenses, I only buy camera holsters, backpacks, sling bags, and shoulder bags that offer full rain protection for my SLR cameras.  If you carry your expensive SLR camera around as much as I do, then you will realize that you do not have to live in the Pacific Northwest to eventually get rained upon unexpectedly.<br /><br />If you have a SLR camera that costs many hundreds of dollars or more, you may want to go beyond this price range for a better holster.  In the $50-$100 price range, I am a big fan of the Think Tank \\"Digital Holster\\" and Lowepro \\"Toploader Pro\\" holsters.  Both of these product lines come with top-notch design and build quality, flexible storage options, heavy-duty comfortably padded shoulder straps with metal snap clips that attach to metal D-rings, rain protection, and an expandable component-based approach that lets you attach various pouches and cases to the holster (for example, to attach a pouch containing your flash, other lens cases, or even attach a travel-sized tripod to the holster).<br /><br />Case Logic makes a wide variety of great protective cases, and I have bought various Case Logic cases over the years, including their cassette tape carrying cases during the 1980s.  But if you had to buy just one holster for your SLR camera, I do think that there are better options for about the same price as this one.  An expensive SLR camera deserves a better holster or carrying case than a $100 point-and-shoot camera.You will get a temporary amount of rain protection using this Case Logic holster (e.g. for darting across parking lots during a heavy rain), but the water will soak through the zippers and seams.  Some people do not think about how rainproof their camera case will be... until they get caught out in the open during a torrential downpour.  To protect my investment in three camera bodies and seven lenses, I only buy camera holsters, backpacks, sling bags, and shoulder bags that offer full rain protection for my SLR cameras.  If you carry your expensive SLR camera around as much as I do, then you will realize that you do not have to live in the Pacific Northwest to eventually get rained upon unexpectedly.<br /><br />If you have a SLR camera that costs many hundreds of dollars or more, you may want to go beyond this price range for a better holster.  In the $50-$100 price range, I am a big fan of the Think Tank \\"Digital Holster\\" and Lowepro \\"Toploader Pro\\" holsters.

B0034G4ORC|5.0|Roger Ebert wrote an inadvertently hilarious review of this movie in which he explained his is ½ star rating thus:    \\"`Battle: Los Angeles' is noisy, violent, ugly and stupid. Its manufacture is a reflection of appalling cynicism on the part of its makers, who don't even try to make it more than senseless chaos. Here's a science-fiction film that's an insult to the words `science' and `fiction,'\\"    And then finished with these generous words:    \\"Young men: If you attend this crap with friends who admire it, tactfully inform them they are idiots. Young women: If your date likes this movie, tell him you've been thinking it over, and you think you should consider spending some time apart.\\"    Well I can't speak for Mr. Ebert's date, but my wife couldn't keep her hands off this Marine after seeing the movie.         What's so amusing is that \\"Battle: Los Angeles\\" isn't about senseless chaos or science fiction at all.  It's about Marines.      In fact, the movie gives the most accurate portrayal of Marines I've seen in cinema.  It isn't perfect, but the Marines in this movie resemble the Marines I spent three years in Iraq with far more than usual.  It shows how we move, think, talk and gives a sense of why Marines are so phenomenally effective in combat.    In order to concentrate on the Marines, the movie pits them against non-human adversaries and then minimizes the science fiction aspect of the story.  This would seem to be a rather obvious plot device, so I'm at a loss to explain how Mr. Ebert missed it, since he is, by his own implication, a super genius and the better of us all.    I can't really blame men like Mr. Ebert - who spend their whole life getting fat watching make-pretend stories - for not understanding warriors like the US Marines.  But they could at least recognize that some of us in the non-sissified professions aren't simpletons.  I, for example, have a master's degree in physics and a 174 IQ (according to MENSA) and believe I could hold my ownagainst Roger's vastly superior intellect.      The only quibble I had with the movie is the implausibility of aliens who are smart enough for space travel, but dumb enough to invade a country loaded with Marines.  Other than that, I loved it.
B002ZG980U|3.0|I had wanted to see this at the movies but not Hubby's type of movie... never got a chance to go with a friend. I'm glad I bought it... it took several viewings to really understand some things in it and really 'get it' as a whole.  A THINKING kind of movie... it was definitely a worth while purchase. Very fast arrival, new condition as advertised.

0439023513|5.0|-SPOILERS-    After reading several of the reviews on here, I realized I had to write one of my own.  I have tore through this series in a matter of days.  In a precarious week when my time should be focused on midterms, I have lost myself in the world of Katniss Everdeen, in Districts fighting for dominance...in war.    I have read many YA series throughout my life, and I've realized a common pattern--the last book often depresses me.  Many authors never reach the full potential they create in the first few books (I'm looking at you, Libba Bray, with Great and Terrible Beauty, and you, Stephenie Meyer, with those last few chapters of Breaking Dawn), or sometimes, the endings are just not what you expect, and that too is difficult to stomach (like with Tamora Pierce's Alanna series).  But over time, I've grown to truly appreciate the ending of Alanna, and now that I'm an older reader, I genuinely appreciate the ending of the Hunger Games trilogy.    It is easy to go into reading this book expecting Katniss to pick Gale or Peeta, save the world, and have a happy ending.  But Harry Potter and other great series like Ender's Game have taught us the horrors of war, how it truly changes people.  Sometimes happy endings don't fit.  This book is like that.    Katniss goes through so much in this book, from being a pawn of the Capitol to a pawn for the rebels of District 13.  Other reviews say that she never fully rebels or reaches her potential.  I respectfully disagree.  In a time when her family and the lives of the few people who have fought for her are on the line, she makes an ultimatum to President Coin for their lives, in exchange for being the Mockingjay, a symbol of the rebellion.  She is thus a pawn for the rebels, but I think it is important to remember that she has exchanged her freedom essentially for Peeta's.  Katniss has finally grown to love someone outside her immediate little family of Prim, her mother, and Gale enough to make that sacrifice of the freedom she holds so dear.  If that isn't growing up, what is?    As the book continues, she is placed in all manner of difficult situations, forced to confront real battle and to weigh the importance of fulfilling her role as the Mockingjay against the pain that the Capital inflicts upon Peeta for each word exiting her mouth.  Later, Peeta is rescued by the rebels, but he is hijacked--he cannot remember that he loves Katniss.    Thus, Collins has done the unthinkable--she has taken the character who truly loved Katniss regardless of whatever selfish or cruel action she did, and turned him against her (so far against her that he tries to strangle her when he sees her).  Why is this perhaps the most brilliant move she could have taken?  Katniss is forced to earn his love back.  She is forced to confront the actions that she has taken in the past (which were perhaps undeserving of all of Peeta's goodness), and she begins to, for once, try to be the one who is unconditionally loving.  It is downright impossible at first, but as Prim and Delly Cartwright begin to undo some of the effects of the tracker jacker venom and Peeta's grip on reality begins to become the shakiest it has ever been, Katniss painfully has to 1) truly tell him about past events and 2) confront how she really feels about him in the present.    The other man in Katniss' life, Gale, takes an interesting turn in this novel.  He becomes obsessed with revenge, with war, to the point where Katniss' views on it begin to take on stark contrast.  When attempting to get rebel control of District Two, Gale suggests causing an avalanche and then sealing off available exits in the Nut, effectively locking people inside their mountain office to suffocate.  Katniss cannot stomach this idea, first because it reminds her too much of her father's death, but secondly, because she has a shred of humanity left in her.  Suddenly, the war has become something more than just endless fighting, and the Capitol has stopped beingthe only \\"bad guys.\\"  Katniss has effectively realized that the rebel tactics are absolutely no better, and the senseless bloodshed begins to take a toll on Soldier Everdeen.    As the book continues further, the rebels prepare for an invasion into the Capitol.  It is in this preparatory segment that the past victors shine the brightest.  Finnick and Johanna become of vital importance, Finnick in showing in the first half of the novel his love for Annie (and despondence at her capture along with Peeta), then later, after she is rescued and they are married, they become the Remus Lupin and Tonks of yet another trilogy.  Every book has the couple who shows amid war and civil unrest the promise of happiness, and the best writers make us love them so dearly.  Just as with Lupin, the ending, however, hurts.  It is the kind of plot twist you cannot overlook--nobody, regardless of the side they take in a war, wants a child to grow up alone (which is, in my opinion, one of the most haunting moments in all of Harry Potter...seeing Harry's beginning echoed with the child of Remus and Tonks). Finnick will stay firmly in your memory after you close this book, and so will Johanna, but for an entirely different reason.  She had the cell next to Peeta's in the Capitol, but unlike Peeta, who still cannot separate reality from fiction due to the venom, she remembers everything.  She becomes a symbol of the Capitol's cruelty.  Her strength and abrasiveness from Book 2 have been replaced with cowering at the sight of rain and an inability to bathe, due to the Capitol's technique of torturing her with water.    The final chapters will rip you apart.  The deaths pile up, and we have to watch and feel with Katniss as the perils of war take their toll.  Some deaths you cannot help but react-- we have grown to love some of these people so dearly-- but others, you may simply sigh or groan because it was yet another life that could not be avoided.  While the battle between Presidents Coin and Snow heat up and the rebels and Capitol use increasingly underhanded tactics, Katniss simply attempts to keep her own ground force alive.  It is reminiscent of the first two Hunger Games, and it takes her hunting skill combined with every ounce of her resourcefulness from years of starvation to preserve the lives of any in her unit.  She still manages to keep a small amount alive, and she gets them to the Capitol lawn, intending to kill President Snow.    The ending will hurt.  I screamed as I visualized it-  Prim, running across the lawn in full medic attire, one moment holding on the remainder of a fatally injured child, the next, being blown up herself.  It was horrific.  From that point, I could completely understand Katniss losing all will to live.  She has lost the one thing she swore to protect, the only reason she ever entered the Hunger Games in the first place.  The war has truly destroyed the most beautiful and innocent of things--Prim, who only wanted to be a doctor and help others.    It is heartbreaking, and I can't help but feel Katniss' disquiet when she talks to the imprisoned President Snow.  I feel the doubt creeping in.  Did he not send that bomb?  What good would it have done?  If he had that technology, why didn't he use it before? The questions are too pointed not to be true.    Later, when asked to shoot Snow as her symbolic last real act as the Mockingjay, I support her again as the bow changes targets.  Retribution.  In trying to secure her support, the rebels have just lost their most powerful ally...and that ally has lost her grip on reality.  Not much follows, but the bit that does sees Katniss struggling with the effects of war and rebellion, attempting to learn how to live after so much of her world has been torn apart.  I find the epilogue truly brilliant in this way--she realizes the weight of her actions in the past three books, and realizes that eventually those actions must be explained to the next generation.  In thinking aboutthe future, however, she also memorializes the past in the \\"face book\\" she creates for all the lives sacrificed in the hopes of that brighter future.    Hunger Games was brilliant.  My brain is exhausted.  My heart hurts a little.  Mostly, though, I feel like I did after I finally finished HP7: sated, knowing that even if it is fictional, Katniss has stayed true to herself and is somewhere by a meadow surrounded by loved ones, regaining what is left of her humanity.
B004APVI1G|4.0|I have played that movie twice so far and will play it again probably two more times as other family members converge to see it in its dazzling 3-D format!<br /><br />The 3-D effect is so much pronounced birds literally fly into your lap!<br />The interaction between the family of owls mimic our own interaction as human beings!<br />The looks of the owls are so breathtaking and so colorful, the scenery so captivating and the song \\"..take to the sky\\" will be forever remembered.<br />I'd advise families to buy it without the least reserve..3-D or not!<br />It is a good story, great entertainment and a time well spent.
B000YKE87W|2.0|Or maybe he just isn't as good as Corelli or di Stefano and the rest.     People will call him a Heldentenor, a Dramatic Tenor, a Spinto tenor (he certainly isn't a Lyric one) but all I hear is dark dark dark with few overtones and no brightness (where is the chiaro in the chiaroscuro?). I'd rather to listen to Ben Heppner or real Baritones like Hvorostovsky or Terfel than this.     If you like him, I think that's fine. His voice is too one dimensional for me to enjoy especially with these commonplace Arias are done far better by others. If you happen to like Paul Potts, then I don't think you should comment on real Opera singers (and Kaufmann actually is one).
B002XMGGK6|3.0|This was a SPECTACULAR movie, right up until the end that is.    Why Hollyweird has to ruin really good movies with the sappy, predictable, \\"good triumphs over evil\\" ending I'll never understand.    What a shame.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|Awesome sound track. Not the norm for Daft Punk, but they did a good job and I enjoy listening to it.    Oh Yea!!  Forgot, If you can't play this on your Computer, it's because you need to update the firmware on your Drive. Go to the manufacturers website and search for \\"Firmware Update\\".  It didn't play on mine until I did the updates. (The drive can read it, it just doesn't know what to do with the information)
B004HWR406|4.0|I agree with the person who complained about sound. The opening scene in the club was too real...meaning there was so much sound interference that I could hardly make out what the characters were saying.  Besides that, the first half of the movie was an intriguing portrait of the development of Facebook.  But halfway through it got more and more boring, messy, party oriented, and I finally fast forwarded through to the end to see how the movie was completed.  The actors were excellent, but it could have been shorter with better sound editing.
0956827802|5.0|Very creative, funny and obviously successful idea.  It is sold out!  I was ready to order at least 4 copies when I logged on here.
030746363X|4.0|This book is a case study of Scientific Inquiry where your body is the subject. It contains a series of 'hacks' and other experiments that either the author or his acquaintances have undertaken and their results.  Its an intriguing attempt to review the state of diet, exercise and supplements and how they can be employed to achieve a physical goal.     I believe the poor reviews of this book are from folks that expected a more linear approach to weight loss or some other goal.  The author's initial chapter includes \\"5 rules - how to use this book\\":  1. Think of this book as a buffet  2. Skip the science if its too dense  3. Please be skeptical  4. Don't use skepticism as an excuse for inaction  5. Enjoy it    There's a philosophy in the book: Try it.  Is it working? Yes. Then keep doing it.  If not, then try something else that works for you.  Is it working? No. Then try something else.  But the message is keep trying something til it works for you.   With that caveat, even if you get a few tools or methods to assist you in accomplishing your goals then the price is worth it.  His insight into engaging socially/online to harness the psychology of commitment is worthwhile, his recommendation for negative re-enforcement are helpful(i.e. 5 lb of simulated bodyfat) & his exercise routines make sense and have helped me.      But more than all of this is his metaphorical slap upside my head: Its your body, your life, measure it, exercise it, improve it.      Any negative reviews seem almost besides that point.
B0015KO52S|5.0|This album has stayed in rotation on my MP3 player for longer than any album I can recall in a long time, and almost every song has made it on to one of my song mixes. Other reviewers have already described why, I just can't resist adding my props and vote for five stars.
B0034G4ORC|2.0|After seeing a few of the trailers for this movie I really was hoping that it was better than it turned out being.  We both found this movie boring and predictable.  I persoanlly thought this was Michelle Rodriguez's worst role that I can remember seeing her in.  I will go on to say that we appeared to be in the minority as quite a few people were clapping at the end of it.
B003F1L02I|1.0|If you're a die hard FNM man, you'll be dis-satisfied with this album. It has a quasi \\"Angel Dust\\" \\"tone\\" to it, but it just doesn't cut the mustard and falls flat on creativity. I almost got the feeling that they really didn't know what to do with the music they were playing. It was all over the place.
B004R0WKNE|3.0|The story is great but there is too much back ground music and noise. It's just an OK movie, I guess I wasn't in the mood for so much noise. The music is great just not during the talking and there are a lot of music montages.
B004D5HRJK|3.0|Look, you probably already know it and you don't need me to say it. Queen from 1973 to 1980 was a COMPLETELY different-sounding band than Queen from 1981 to 1991 (or to 1997, however long you want to stretch it). Yeah, there were the same four members: John Deacon on bass, Freddie Mercury on vocals, Brian May on guitar, and Roger Taylor on drums and percussion, in addition to Spike Edney on keyboards (in concert -- I always have viewed him as the fifth member of Queen).    But the change wasn't a bad thing. Queen morphed into a very mature band. They were diverse. Sometimes, they rocked (listen to 'Hammer to Fall' and 'One Vision' if you don't believe me). Sometimes, they pulled on the heartstrings with a tender ballad ('Who Wants to Live Forever' is a classic example of this). And other times, they were just Queen ('It's a Hard Life' and 'Breakthru' exemplify this). Queen were a band that were constantly growing and changing album after album, and it's such a shame that run was cut short on November 24, 1991, when Freddie Mercury departed this planet due to a dreadful disease called AIDS.    Nearly 20 years later (in November, it will be exactly 20 years later), we still haven't fully recovered from Freddie's death. To many, it is as shocking today that he is gone as it was the day it happened. It still hasn't sunk in for many, and I doubt it ever will. But the music the man left behind will live forever, bar none. The Justin Biebers and Jonas Brothers will come and go; Queen's music will still be taught in Music Appreciation classes in the 3000s. They are truly timeless.    Now, to this album.    'Greatest Hits II' is the last album Queen released during Freddie's lifetime. It spans the years 1981 to 1991, from 'Hot Space' to 'Innuendo.' During those ten years, Queen changed drastically, both musically and personally. Freddie was diagnosed with HIV in 1987, and Brian May went through a painful divorce around that time as well and contemplated suicide. But let's not forget the musical changes, either. In the 1970s, Queen had a strict \\"no synthesizer\\" policy; by 1980, with the release of 'The Game,' it was obvious that Queen had changed that, so much so that by 1983, Queen were fully embracing synthesizers and drum programming.    And that is what dominates much of this compilation. You get all of the big U.K. hits from this period, and nothing BUT the hits. There's no filler here; other than the absence of 'Las Palabras De Amor' and 'These Are the Days of Our Lives' (both of which appeared on the lackluster 'Greatest Hits III,' released in 1999), basically every major hit single from this band is represented here.    You get 'One Vision,' 'Friends Will Be Friends,' the anthem (and perhaps the song that defined Live Aid better than any other) 'Radio Ga Ga,' and 'I Want it All.' In essence, the big ones are here. For the casual Queen fan or the new Queen fan who has the \\"classic\\" period of 1973-1980 covered, 'Greatest Hits II' is a natural next step.    So why only three-and-a-half stars here?    Well, let's start with the issues I have. The album contains some horrible edits. The edit of 'One Vision' is horrific; it's like the \\"magic\\" (no pun intended) was sucked right out of the song. It loses a lot of its effectiveness by having that classic synth intro chopped down to bits. Listen to the album version that appears on 'A Kind of Magic' from 1986 instead of this one. 'Classic Queen' (basically the Americanized version of 'Greatest Hits II') contains this track edited as well, although at least that one retains most of the synth intro. That edit (if you have to listen to one) is by far the better of the two.    Same with 'I Want it All.' While this edit isn't really that bad, it does lose some of it's power and effect here. Buy the 1989 album 'The Miracle' to hear it in its full length glory if you really want to (I recommend that album -- it is easily one of Queen's strongest albums of the decade), but otherwise, the single edit offered here should work just fine.    I should also point out that the version of 'Under Pressure' featured on this collection is a special remix. It's not drastic, and unless you are a fanatical Queen fan or someone who listened to rock radio every day and every hour in 1982-83, you'll hardly notice the difference. The remix is actually quite good; yeah, it shortens the song by about 10 seconds, but it works. It's a good remix that is incredibly well-done and it suits this collection perfectly. So if you are a Queen collector, definitely buy 'Greatest Hits II' just to add that nugget to your Queen collection.     Overall, 'Greatest Hits II' is a strong Queen collection spanning their last decade as a band. Queen put out some fine albums during the ten-year period of 1981-1991, and sadly, America seemed to overlook them all. However, all of these songs were HUGE hits in England and everywhere else on planet earth, so if you want a Queen collection spanning their best tracks from the decade of excess, than look no further. This is it. This has all of the songs a British Queen fan would have heard on the radio during the period, on one compact disc. So check it out.    As for the 2010 remaster, I really can't review that. I have heard good things, but I have the 2002 CD offered as a part of 'The Platinum Collection' box set. However, I will say this: I like the redesigned cover of the album better. The bright yellow crest suits the cover much better than the faded gold one did. So I can say this about the reissue: Island Records (who now owns Queen's catalogue everywhere except America and Canada) got the cover art right. For what that's worth.    You really can't go wrong with 'Greatest Hits II.' Normally, I can't stand Queen compilations, but this was the second collection, and really should have been the second of maybe four or five Queen compilations, and that's all. This is a fine album with plenty of fine tracks. Casual fans will want it for the track listing (look at all of those hits!); collector's will want it for that unique remix of 'Under Pressure.' Just remember that many of the songs appear in their radio edits (or single edits), and you'll be able to enjoy this disc very much.    I love Queen and own most of their studio albums, and yet, I still come back to 'Greatest Hits II' frequently. It truly is a very good compilation. It would have been great, if only they would have stretched this out to two discs and just included the album versions, but such is life.     This disc is still very highly recommended. Check it out and come to your own conclusion about it.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I feel like I'm watching a movie every week! This show has it going on!! For the SNOBS out there.... I'm sure True Blood is great, but you really can't compare the two because TB is on a cable channel where they can be a little more graphic. With TVD, it was intended for the younger audience and is on a local standard channel. I think this show appeals to all ages because even though it's sexy, it's also wholesome. And Damon.... that man is HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00006AW2O|2.0|Every great musical act has had a miss and 12x5 is a really bad miss. This album continues the Stones path of R&B, and Blues infused rock covers, but unforutnately unlike that album this album had few songs to like about it. Around and Around is a thumping good intro for the album and a disappointing one in some ways, it is easily by far the best song on the album followed by Susie Q and the instrumental track 2120 South Michigan Avenue. The rest of the tracks of so so with the worst among them their take of Time is On Your Side and Under the Boardwalk (never again should they attempt to do R&B harmonies).
B0034G4OZE|5.0|This movie was a gem. An honest account of multiple lives colliding on one common ground. Zak G, was unbelievable in this movie. His dry humor as always was present but we got to see a serious side of his acting that was fabulous. If you have ever had a moment in your life when you think your depressed or sad (as most human beings do) you should see this film. It reminds us of where we end up sometimes and who these people really are behind the walls of a mental institution, relatable people who have real issues but behind it all are elements of the human experiences. A wonderful film, check it out.
B00006AW2M|4.0|Their Satanic Majesties Request is a piece of pyschedlic bliss and is more than welcome change to the Rolling Stones orginal Blues-Rock sound which they switched back to after this release which makes it just as wonderful. The album is great and it not to long nor too short. Unfortunately compared to some of their earlier and even some of their later works such as Aftermath, England's Newest Hitmakes, and Beggar's Banquet, TSMR doesn't quite live up to that level but on its own merit is a great album. Noteworthy songs are In Another Land (which was written and sung by Bill Wyman), She's a Rainbow, 2000 Light Years from Home, Sing This All Together. TSMR its not as overrated nor is it as underrated as some my make it out to be, and its definitely not subpar to Sgt Pepper's Lonely Heart Club Band. Its a decent album that should have a spot in evey casual stones fans catalouge as it a good listen to and a unique one as its the stones on trip into psycehdelic rock.
B004QK5N5W|4.0|Got this today at Apple store.  Tried it with my iPad One.  It does not mirror the image on a HDTV via HDMi cable.  It does however support several apps.  It allowed me to play videos stored on my iPad.  It also allows me to watch Netflix.  Sound is transmitted as well as video on my HDTV. The quality appears to be standard definition from what I can tell.  Definitely not HD.  My Apple TV is definitely out putting at 720P.  This is not.   Maybe someone with an iPad Two can verify HD output and mirroring. It also supports Keynote, however it would not let me do a standard slideshow via the photos I have saved on the iPad.   Maybe operator error, but I can not seem to get it to work.   Overall I am still happy with the purchase.
B0016CO2HS|5.0|Up intil Aftermath I had always opted to my native American releases of the Rolling Stones 1960s catalouge, and when it comes to Aftermath though the is no question about it the British verison should be your first choice (beware though you can only download it digital on either Amazon or iTunes as the physical copy is the subpar American release.) because some of the best tracks from the album where omitted off the album like Take it of Leave and Mother's Little Helper. The latter of the two is a nice number about drug abuse which features Mick Jagger's natural British accent. Other great tracks off this album includes Under My Thumb, Stupid Girl, Doncha Bother Me, Take it Or Leave It, and High and Dry. Unforunately though this verison doesn't include the wickedly awesome Paint It, Black which is included in the American release. Overall Aftermath is a great preview to what the Jagger/Richard(s) team would write in years to come as this is their first album to include songs written soley by the pair.
B002ZG975Q|4.0|I've already reviewed the audio book for this title, I also read the book, so on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being someone who saw the book at the store and passed it up and 10 being someone who has memorized all the mushiest parts, I'm a 7, I know this book and liked it so much I sent a copy to my sister.<br /><br />Anyway, on to the movie, I loved Beastly and when I saw the first movie preview I was in raptures until I saw who would be playing Lindy, Vanessa Hudgens.  Now, let me state first that I have no idea what kind of acting chops she has.  I've never seen High School Musical and have no plans to in the future.  My objection to Ms. Hudgens was based on purely shallow reasons, she's too pretty.  In fact, she's alarmingly beautiful and there is no way that Vanny could play the plain, quiet and unnoticed title character.<br /><br />So, for me, that was strike one against the film version.  How can Lindy, quiet, sweet, brilliant and empathetic soothe (and ultimately capture the heart) of the jaded, arrogant, wounded and bitter beast?  Well, she does but I have to admit it wasn't quite as moving as it was in the book.  I know film adaptations rarely are, but still, it was a disappointment, luckily one of just a few things that were changed.<br /><br />But, other than the fact that Kyle/Hunter (his name was changed to Adrian in the book) doesn't spend as long finding out about Lindy, her life with a druggie father, her struggles to carve out a life for herself and gradually falling for her, I thought the movie was lovely.<br /><br />The book has several laugh out loud moments, particularly during the online support group chats, but the movie had similar bouts of funny, in particular, Kyle\Hunter's attempts to lure Lindsay from her room in typical rich boy fashion (I wasn't the only one laughing, the theater was packed and I heard people around me giggling).<br /><br />Several people have mentioned Neil Patrick Harris' portrayal of Will, I too was struck by how right he was for the role and the touch of whimsy he brought to it.  He was the perfect counterpoint to Kyle's dark and negative fall from grave.<br /><br />There were, of course, several other things that changed and I'm not certain that they made the movie better or worse.  I was dreadfully disappointed in the Percy Jackson movie, the same with the Wizard of Earthsea, The Clan of the Cave Bear, Eragon, Queen of the Damned, I could go on, but it's too damn depressing.<br /><br />My only other complaint about the movie and it's kind of a biggie is that it was sooooo short, just 86 minutes.  Come on, this isn't a disney movie about a lonely hedgehog and a hyperactive moose.  Who knows, maybe there will be a director's version released and it will have some cut scenes that bring the movie length up to a real feature length.<br /><br />But for all it's little quirks, I thought the movie was fun and romantic, I sighed with relief at the end (particularly because a really nasty character gets a chance for some magical transformation of his own).  Relief that the filmmakers didn't screw up one of my fave romances.imsy he brought to it.  He was the perfect counterpoint to Kyle's dark and negative fall from grave.

B00006AW2P|5.0|Even 47 years after this album (and its British counterpart the Rolling Stones) was released it still a really great listen, and an a great introduction to Rolling Stones earlier work not a one of the greatest Rock and Roll band to have come out of England but as one of the greatest Blues-Rock covers. They really did a wonderful job of taking some really great American Blues records and making them there own. And for beginning songwriters the three songs by the now renown team and Jagger and Richards are simply superb one of them Little by Little is one of my favorite tracks by them. Tracks from this album to check out are Route 66, I Just Wanna Make Love to You, Little By Little, and Not Fade Away (which is not included in the original it takes the place of I Need You Baby (Mona).
B00127RAJY|5.0|I borrowed this from a friend, then bought it because I felt it would be effective and realistic for me. I have been doing the first workout of the three every other day for a month, and I have lost 6.8 lbs. (I am not strict about the foods I eat on the weekends, but if I were I would probably lose more). It is a very intense workout: When finished, I feel like I've really exerted myself. It is not a long workout: It's about 22 minutes long, and the quick changes and variety of exercises help tremendously with the pacing. It has a positive tone: Jillian's phrases and tone are very encouraging (I disagree with some of the other reviewers; I think they are confusing this DVD with the TV show Biggest Loser...?), and she does tell you how to do the moves correctly. I have made some modifications to the workout to suit myself: I warm up for 3 extra minutes, stretching my neck, shoulder and ankle muscles. I cool down longer when I have time by dancing to my favorite music. I usually do the workout in the morning on an empty stomach well before breakfast. I choose to do it every other day because I found some of the exercises hard on my knees (I'm 43), and I need variety to sustain my commitment. Regarding knee strain, I don't do the lunges because I have a twingey knee, so on the two lunging exercises in Workout 1, I do knee bends as far down as I can comfortably go. Also, I have stopped doing the jump-rope style cardio; instead, I run in place lifting my knees as high as I can. I look forward to this workout; it's a challenge for me, but I know I will feel great when I finish and I'm not wasting my time. I feel that I am getting stronger and have more endurance; when I walk in the park sometimes I even break out into a run, which is so not like the old me. I am the kind of person who tends to dread exercise and isn't very coordinated, so consider this review a high recommendation. Also, some people have said they don't like that you can't skip the intro, but I watch mineon my laptop on Power DVD which remembers where I was when I last used the DVD, and it takes me to the main menu each time, so that has not been a problem for me. I also like this DVD because when I master Workout 1, there are two more workouts at higher levels of intensity to try. Incidentally, I am not a viewer of Biggest Loser; I looked into this DVD because I heard a few of my friends talking about how they benefited from it.
B000002UA0|5.0|The Piper at the Gates of Dawn it so completely out there. The lyrics are nonsensical at times and but its really not the lyrics that makes Pink Floyd's debut album so interesting and also so hard to put down, its really the intrumental backing the lyrics that makes this album so good. It is positively dripping in psychedelia, its what both SPLCHB, Magical Mystery Tour from the Beatles, and TSMR by the Rolling Stones failure to deliver that is a full on pyscehdelic experience. Overall though every on here is worth a listen in their own right.
B001F0WXY0|1.0|Wow, the Kindle version is selling for $15.99 but the used paperback is selling for like $3.25, the new paperback for $9.99. It's also free at your local library. The publisher sets the price. I like this book, but for $15.99 it gets 1 star after adjusting for the value proposition.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|Dexter is better written, acted and produced than 95% of all television shows. And although I agree with some reviewers who say the story arc wasn't quite as strong or believable as seasons one or three, no season of Dexter has caused me more gut-churning anxiety. Lyla does become somewhat grating - but I also feel the same way about Rita every year.<br /><br />Michael C. Hall finally makes the character someone I care about. Don't get me wrong, I think it's almost impossible to create a sympathetic character out of a serial-killing psychopath who is incapable of human emotion. Season 2 is when I stopped watching Dexter as an awesomely written curiosity and really started rooting for him. Hall brings the depth in a super-subtle way and deserves any accolades he gets.
B004J88SGC|4.0|There is no question that when it has came down to great music, many of today's artists like Lady Gaga, Rihanna and Beyonce' have been known to lip sync into their performances, where they've personally stopped delivering anything that has felt organic or special. Sometimes it is lackluster music that makes me constantly go back to artists who've only been known for talent, not flash and flare. That has been the case with Billy Joel. While it has been almost 20 years since he delivered his last album, River Of Dreams, his music has always remained timeless just like it was yesterday. But when it has came down to performing live, the Piano Man still has shown to knock it right out of the park. That was the case when he was the first singer to do a concert at Yankee Stadium in 1990, and again as he performed the final concert at Shea Stadium. For his hard core fans, and die hard fans of his music, that concert is here for all to enjoy.<br /><br />Billy Joel: Live At Shea Stadium showcases the 2 concerts that Billy Joel had sung his heart out and tickled those ivories like there was no tomorrow on DVD. The concert is well-received and honestly one of the best live concert packages you've seen of Billy Joel. The 2 night event showcases some of Billy's biggest songs, sung to a whole new generation of fans. Billy performs some of his classics like My Life, his standard Piano Man, also rocking out to a guitar on We Didn't Start The Fire in one of the rare times we've seen Billy strum a guitar in concert, and Scenes From An Italian Restaurant to just name a few. There are also some great collaborations here as well including Shameless with Garth Brooks and New York State Of Mind with legendary crooner Tony Bennett. The live event is fun to enjoy, but some of the songs he performed with others could've brought in some more life alone. Not only that, but one of Billy's biggest tributes also came into playing piano into other songs of his own, like leading classic songs like Take Me Out To The Ball Game and Yankee Doodle Dandy into some of his hits like My Life & Piano Man. While it is clever going toward his own music, it just adds into Billy's classic standard of why he still can play to a wonderful audience, despite not making a album in years.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed watching Billy Joel: Live At Shea Stadium, and it is a great delight for any die hard Billy Joel fan, or for anyone who is also new to Billy's music with his over 40 year career of playing great music. There are a lot of memories Billy had made for all audiences and generations young and old with his music, and this is a wonderful moment from a man who not only became the first singer to perform live at Yankee Stadium and the grand finale of Shea Stadium hands down. I absolutely recommend this DVD a lot. Keep singing Billy, because you're keeping on doing New York proud.<br /><br />DVD Cover: B<br /><br />Mastering: B+<br /><br />Extras: B<br /><br />Price: B 1/2+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+ut To The Ball Game and Yankee Doodle Dandy into some of his hits like My Life & Piano Man.

0307001466|1.0|We absolutely love this book. It's a wonderful story with the most beautiful illustrations I have ever seen. They are clever and inspired. But this edition Amazon sells is missing about 1/2 of the spreads that are found in the original. Perhaps this is a ploy by the Little Golden Books to get you to buy their collection of 10 stories.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I had to repurchase this movie because the other dvd got broken.  My children thoroughly enjoy this movie.  I recommend it highly.
0385533829|4.0|While I agree with common sentiment that The Lost Symbol isn't quite in the league of Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code, this book is a very good read in its own right.  As usual, Dan Brown gives very good physical description to the setting as well as great character development.  This makes the book a great lesson in history as well as a great fictional read.
B0041KKYD8|4.0|Very violent, very sick, very brutal.  Not for the faint hearted.    This one is more about the revenge than the actual initial criminal act, I felt.
B0001XALTG|5.0|Trainspotting is the kind of movie I can watch a hundred times and never get sick of. While the subject matter is gritty and occasionally dark, there is an overlying humor to the Renton character's narration that keeps it an enjoyable experience. Not for the squeemish, this film deals frankly with the effects of heroin addiction. The film stays mostly true to the incredible Irvine Welsh novel, with most of the dialogue and narration lifted right off the pages. However some characters are combined or deleted and of course not nearly all of the subject matter in the book is dealt with. An incredible soundtrack and a star-making performance from Ewan MacGregor and indeed the rest of the ensemble cast top off what in my book is a must-see film.    I have not actually owned this film until now, and this DVD comes with a lot of deleted scenes and commentaries that made it worth the money.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Christina plays a small town girl who leaves town and her Mickey Mouse life and heads to LA during the credits. In LA she is attracted to a 1920's style burlesque club. The small club puts on a large theater type show with costumes and a band. So even with the $20 cover charge, on a great night they wouldn't come close to breaking even, let alone pay the band, which is more like a small orchestra. I'm not sure why they even have a band since most of the girls lip sync. The club has a surreal appearance and the men who work there are dressed as gang characters from \\"Clockwork Orange\\" complete with the derby and eye make-up, although they incorrectly make-up both eyes instead of just one.<br /><br />Christina works as a waitress at the club and desires to be a star on this sinking ship. The star of the show is a problem child who shows up late and has an attitude. It doesn't take any imagination to figure out how this turns out. Christina belts out a few good numbers, but when she is not singing and dancing she really isn't acting. Cher does a fine job of acting and makes the rest of the crew look like a high school drama club.<br /><br />Cher belts one out too. This movie is set up as a \\"pass the torch\\" symbolism. We saw how well that worked with the Madonna/Brittney/Christina kiss-NOT!<br /><br />The movie is worth 5 stars on the strength of Christina's singing and Cher's acting.

0061726826|5.0|Review from YA-Sisterhood blog [...]  Reviewed by: Baby Sister Brittany  The Sisters say: Startling. Strong. Succulent.    It's official. I've been infected.    With Amor Deliria Nervosa. Also known as Delirium. Also known as love.     I loved this book. (Am I allowed to say I loved a book that is about a world where \\"love\\" has been deemed a disease?) Ah, who cares! I LOVED THIS BOOK.    We all have certain kinds of books we like to read--a literary niche, if you will. And for me, I've always drifted towards books dealing with forbidden love. And I don't just mean \\"forbidden\\" in the sense that it's unusual or improper or even slightly dangerous for the two main characters to be together. I gravitate towards the kind of forbidden love where it is unusual, improper, dangerous, and seemingly impossible for our ingénues to find any kind of happiness.  I want love so forbidden that to choose each other means giving up something else important (perhaps everything else)--a sacrifice of self, family, and possibly sanity (since characters must go against every instinct of self-preservation to choose that kind of love). I want books about the kind of love that most of us would turn down in real life because of the danger, our sense of reason, and plain common sense--the kind of relationships we only ever get to have in our imaginations. And Delirium is just that kind of book!  The relationship that develops between Lena and Alex is not only forbidden because of her uncured status (and the secrets of Alex's identity), but also because LOVE, itself, is forbidden. Lena lives in a world where even families treat each other with cold detachment. Her mother's \\"I love you,\\" given as a gift in their last moment together, acts as a seed implanted deep in Lena's mind that blooms gradually and beautifully despite the propaganda that Lena has grown up believing as fact.    Speaking of propaganda--the little tidbits of information at the beginnings of each chapter, ranging from politically-correct love-bashing nursery rhymes to handbooks about the cure, acted as little hooks that reeled me in bit by bit into Oliver's world. They, along with the rest of the book, are deliciously quotable. After each one, I was itching to call someone and read each little section aloud. Several times I had to stop reading and mark a quote (or enter it as a Facebook status), because they were so provoking that I didn't want to forget.    I could sit here and wax poetic for several pages about the captivating plot of this book, my affection for the characters, and how completely their world captured me, but I think this book's strongest attributes speak for themselves. The concept is novel and fascinating, and if you give it a chance--you'll read with horror and fascination and excitement as the story unfolds.    I will speak briefly about my one issue with the book. While I thought the world-building with respect to the disease and the cure was fascinating and complete, I do think that the world-building was lacking elsewhere. I have trouble believing that people just up and decided love was a disease one day and readily accepted a cure when it became available. I feel like there would have to be some huge inciting incident in order for the love-haters to so outweigh the love-lovers (teehee...). And that's information that is never revealed. Besides the cure--travel is also restricted in the U.S. and city borders shut down, but besides that--life seems relatively normal.  People go to college, have kids, etc (all according the governments assignments, however). I can't believe that a society that was willing to be cured of love would be so similar to ours. I wanted to know how lack of love affected the rest of the world--Do people only work for money rather than enjoyment? Are there no more arts? No more entertainment? No more sadness?  If you don't love anything to begin with--does it hurt to lose it? We see glances of rebellion in the forbidden music that Lena is exposed to, but that is a small percentage of how life was on the whole. Perhaps it's naïve of me, but I think that so much of life is about love. And so much of the world is about life. So to take love out of the equation, I expected the world to be drastically altered--like a rainbow without colors, a book without words--that to me, is life without love. Looking at the cured characters in the book, they aren't just cured of love, but most emotions all together. I believe one of the propaganda sections said that the cure cut down on crime (no more crimes of passion), but wouldn't a world of complete emotional detachment also have its dangers? Can there be guilt when no other emotions are present?    None of this cut down on my enjoyment of the book. On the contrary, the mark of a good book is one that makes you stop and think about the world in which it takes place. I wouldn't have wasted my time on a lesser book. I was simply so captivated that I wanted to know more. I wanted a finished painting rather that just the main idea.    I look forward to the second book in the series--in the hopes that it will continue to fill in the gaps in this new dystopian world. I'm also dying to know what happens next after the unforgettable, heart-wrenching ending of the first (another literary niche of mine--I love authors brave enough to put twists at the end that aren't just exciting, but heart-breaking and world-changing).    So, go ahead. Read Delirium. Catch my disease.
B001DU8T6I|5.0|Demi is such a talented as other stars   She was talented on CAMP ROCK 1&2,Sonny With a Chance,Here we go again CD and she belongs on DISNEY!  Now Back To Don't Forget  Don't Forget is an awesome album  La La Land is a rockin song all the songs are awesome you should get it now!
B002M9WW30|5.0|Great buy!!  My husband loves the picture, sound and bonus material.. I can't watch the blue-ray for Rocky being in there ALL time.  :)
B000VE439Y|5.0|I have not seen the bonus features, so I will concentrate on the movie. I saw it when it first came out in the theaters and thought it was superbly witty. I am surprised, however, that so much has been focused on the supposed \\"sacrilege\\" of the movie, of which there really isn't any if you take a good look at it. The main thrust, however, is at fanaticism in general and the fanaticism that is ruthlessly skewered in the movie is political fanaticism. Judean Liberation Front: why does that sound familiar? Leftists originally watching the movie must have squirmed in their seats when they first saw it because they are realistically portrayed as being pedantic, hair splitting, dogmatic, endlessly feuding with other groups of fanatics who have the same goals as theirs, constantly engaging the verbal diarrhea, posturing at being holier than thou.    There was one aspect of the movie that I did not like, but others will, and it is one of the trademarks of the Monty Python crew and that was that the same actors were in multiple roles throughout the movie. Some fans of the team may like that, but I personally would have preferred that they had employed addtional actors for the roles.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|These are a pretty good option if you want cross platform use and are cheap.  They work exactly as advertised with really no problems to report.  There are a lot of cables involved, but you obviously know that going into the purchase.    The biggest gripe with this headset is the hum when you are playing the game.  It's true, there is a hum, but you only really notice it right when you put them on.  After a minute or so your brain filters it out and you don't even notice it.  It's sort of like people that live near some sort of processing plant, after a while they no longer smell the acrid fumes.    The set up of this guy for the PS3 is pretty easy with HDMI as long as you kept the cable that came with your system.  The older model XBOX's are a little more complicated.  I have an elite, and the composite/component cable sits over the HDMI port when it's plugged in.  Using either of these methods instead of HDMI isn't an option for a snob like me, so it took a little work to get past this stupid design flaw.  I picked up an extra composite/component cable for 2 bucks or something from one of the resellers here (I didn't want to wreck my only one in case something goes out and I need a backup).  If you use a screw driver or chisel, you can knock the gray casing off allowing both outputs to run in tandem.  Once you get past this hurdle, there are no problems.      Aside from that, they are a pretty good set of head phones if you don't want to bother those around you while playing, watching Netflix, etc.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|As someone who is enchanted by myth and fairytale for what it tells us about how we see ourselves I thoroughly enjoyed this visual adaptation of a classic story. I felt that it managed to remain true to the original themes of the Riding Hood tales and was pleased with the heroine's final destiny. Although it may bear a certain striking resemblance to the Twilight movies it certainly provides us with a much more complex and, quite frankly, courageous female lead. If you are looking for excitement, action, and terror then this is not the movie for you. However, if you are able to appreciate the nuance of the original tale in this striking visual format I would highly recommend it.
B003Y5H542|5.0|Few animated movies can produce such remarks.<br /><br />It has toilet and slapstick humor for kids, smart references to Clint Eastwood and Apocalypse Now, and every scene had a grimy but extremely realistic attention to detail that made this film stand out compared to other animated movies.<br /><br />It is not good as Toy Story (what will?) but at least one director and one studio isn't afraid to make (giant) leaps in the animation genre to produce a timeless and entertaining film.<br /><br />Sure some kids won't understand the true \\"spirit of the west\\" or the countless references to high noon or The Good, The Bad, The Ugly, but for someone looking for an animated that has more than just stellar animation (Kung Fu Panda, How To Train Your Dragon; all good movies mind you), Rango nails it.<br /><br />This is what I would love to see from every movie. Pushing the boundaries so when we go to the theaters we are overflowed with originality.<br /><br />P.S.<br /><br />For all the other movie goers who are out there rating one star because of fowl language, etc., you might want to look at the content descriptors on the movie site or a poster. It clearly states language. And a giving a film 1 star because they say Hell or damn or there is roadkill in a road just shows ignorance.<br /><br />Rango easily rounds up a 5 star review.
B004FHCH9Q|4.0|Christopher Nolan's Memento is one of those films you may have to view several times to truly appreciate. I had heard plenty of buzz about this film for years, but only recently saw it. At many points, I think the viewers are as perplexed as Leonard Shelby. Leonard Shelby(Guy Pearce), searching for his wife's killer, has a rare condition that doesn't allow him to remember certain events. Events are remembered only in a haphazard way, and, for this reason, he uses notes and pictures as an aid for his memory. What makes the film unique is simply the way it is told, using a non-linear or chronological way of telling the story, but rather scattered and fragmented bits and pieces of time through the point of view of Leonard. We have 10-15 minute segments that reveal events and partial memories, and we are constantly rewinding and fast forwarding to a slightly different version of the plot. It's a bit jarring at first, and difficult to follow, but it doesn't alienate the audience, and eventually the viewer is able to pick up on this type of narrative. Give Nolan credit for pulling off such a film and having very few inconsistencies. Several key characters could make or break the case in Leonard's search, but his reliance on scraps of paper and notes only give him partial, vague clues about who to trust. Therefore, from Leonard's point of view, the line between friend and enemy is always indistinct. Memento somehow manages to mimic its storyline with its film techniques, with scattered clues here and there, and is a cerebral whodunit experience for the viewer to try to piece together. It is also a unique, stylish, film that has great pacing and building suspense, and finishes with a nice twist. Just the kind of film for those who are sick of the same old, same old that Hollywood spews out. As far as the extras, they were so-so, hence the 4 star instead of 5 star rating.

Now hotel california the song is one of the greatest songs ever. I dont care how many times the song has been played on the radio its a great song. Also dont listen to all the 1 star comments on this album their lame and dont make sense at all these people dont see talent if it hit them in the face. To all you haters this is one of their best albums period. So please erase all those 1 star reviews. THIS IS A AWESOME CLASSIC!!!
1563894696|2.0|Heard a lot of good things about this story. Also heard Jeph Loeb's writing was supposed to be excellent. Well, personally I did not enjoy this book. And I love Batman. But this just did not feel like a 'true' Batman book. The artwork was just as bad in my honest opinion. Not my cup of tea. The story seemed drawn out and very repetitive. If you like the Dark Knight as a detective and not an action superhero then this might be your type of story. Most of all I did not like how Two-face's origin was re-written. If you like the old school Batman you might like this book. But personally I did not enjoy wasting the time to read this 300+ page book. The best part was the last 3 pages of the story.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters, and I figured I would buy the DVD when it came out.  One of the more action-packed movies that I've seen in a long time, especially since it was based on a true story.  Definitely check it out.
B004IFYMWK|3.0|Great acting from Naomi Watts.<br />Fair to medium acting from Sean Penn  (suffers from some excess).  He usually does better.<br />The story is of course loosely (VERY LOOSELY) based on recent events.<br /><br />The film suffers from the \\"Sean Penn Fanatical Preaching Obsession\\" he seems to have fallen into in recent years.<br /><br />He is so consumed by some of his political views he can't see straight at times it seems and it adversely affects his movie making.<br /><br />It seems he is only concerned with making political propoganda films these days at the exclusion of all else.<br /><br />That is fine if that is all he is interested in now, but don't be surprised if fewer and fewer people get too motivated to see his movies.<br /><br />I imagine that despite the good acting, this movie will go un-noticed and fade away into obscurity without too much attention or discussion.
1400052173|5.0|Fabulous. Well written. Insightful. Juggles  timelines and topics handily. Timely, given  the recent attention to the historically                                         questionable bioethics of medical research.
B002ZG98FU|3.0|I have been a fan & collector of Harrison's for over 30 years now.  I USED to be first in the door opening day for his films.    When I heard about this film & he was doing it I looked for to it.  Thought he would do a great job & when they added Diane to the fix I knew that would be perfect.    They did do great jobs with their roles.    Let's go with the mistakes:  Harrison had 2 films come out in 2010, this one and \\"Extraordinary Measures\\".  BOTH FILMS HE WAS 2CD CREDITED INSTEAD OF FIRST.  Here Oscar winner Diane was 3rd.  Instead the film makers push Rachel McAdam's as top billed.  WRONG.  The film was based on her INSTEAD OF AN EQUAL MIX WITH HER CHARACTER AND THE SHOW.  Right from the beginning of the film her character was pushed down viewers throats.  Did we really need to see a bit on her getting an apartment?  Hands up for anyone who cared......    She can NOT put movie goers into theater seats.  I have ONLY seen one of her prior films \\"State of Play\\" and I saw it because I am a fan of Russell's.   Yep, they used Harrison mostly to promote the film.  OF COURSE HAN SOLO, INDIANA JONES, JOHN BOOK OSCAR NOMINATION WITH THAT, RICHARD KIMBLE, JACK RYAN, ETC & SO ON.  Diane with her long award winning career & they used McAdam's character to base the movie around.    I have nothing against Rachel BUT wrong film makers.  USE THE STARS.    Film SHOULD have been a success & it was one of the mistakes that made it fail.    The music in the film was terrible.  The \\"love story\\" was 100% unnecessary and did nothing but fill time.      Disappointing, SHOULD have been much better.    DVD.  No good extras really & MY COMPLAINT I MAKE ALL THE TIME.  HAS ONE OF THESE CHEAP DVD CASES WITH THE INTENTIONAL HOLES.  CHEAP, CHEAP & CAN DAMAGE YOUR DVD.  No chapter search list.
B001A5OP4Q|1.0|Never buy a series or episode from Amazon if you own a Mac because it will not allow you to download your purchase. I am bitterly disappointed. Even when I am trying to watch it instantly through Amazon, the quality is absolutely terrible and will not run the way it should.     It is better to pay a few extra dollars and buy this series through Itunes.     Of course Mad Men is fantastic but Amazon instant tv ruins the experience of watching it.
0141040343|5.0|I've read Pride and Prejudice nearly every year for a decade and I have to say the Penguin Classics new clothbound edition is the best read I've had yet! The look and feel of the book is beautiful. It's an extremely gratifying read, a delight for the senses, and the appendix is a wonderful essay by Tony Tanner, the original Penguin Classics edition's introduction. While it is lengthy, it actually doesn't get tedious at all and is highly informative and insightful. The new introduction, while I haven't read it fully yet, I believe will prove to be equally revealing. The notes are well-balanced, neither vague nor overwhelming- I've looked at annotated versions of Pride and Prejudice that sucked all the joy out of the story with notes that covered half of each page! Anyway, this edition is absolutely delightful, and I can't wait to purchase Wuthering Heights and Sense and Sensibility in the same edition, and possibly more.
B0034G4ORC|4.0|Mouth-watering previews aside, Battle Los Angeles does not fully deliver upon expectations.  And it's mostly because of shaky cam.  If you don't like that, or hated Cloverfield exclusively because of the filming, you will not appreciate this movie.<br /><br />If you can ignore that jumpy filming, imagine if the aliens from Independence Day had made an atrocious military decision to invade Earth with the lowliest ground troops accompanied by very minimal air or artillery support.  On top of that, the military intelligence brought along for the interstellar colonization is comically inept to the point that basic defensive principles are eschewed for no discernable reason.  Keep in mind this is an alien race that sent an entire mobilized force, disguised as asteroids, across galaxies to destroy the human race and deplete the planet of certain resources.  The positive, however, is in ground-to-ground urban combat.  A grain of salt is necessary for any alien invasion film, but if a fairly realistic portrayal of at least the potential infantry battles between humans and aliens were possible, then this gets closer than any other.<br /><br />Regardless of the plot, the redeeming quality of this movie is primarily in the casting.  Aaron Eckhart exudes senior military qualities.  Cleft chin, rugged features, a delivery both stoic and gruff.  He's completely believable as a Marine, and his heroic yet decisive actions could fill a Medal of Honor citation.  His inexperienced group of jarheads works well together balance out the cast.  Along the way the script writers decided a strong female lead was necessary, one who could talk the talk and fire a machine gun; it therefore became contractually obligatory for the casting director to contact Michelle Rodriguez.  She performs admirably, just as expected.  Rounding out the cast are Bridget Moynahan and Michael Pena as civilians caught in chaos.<br /><br />As already mentioned, the huge negative to this movie is the overuse of the dreaded shaky cam.  The filming in far too many instances was completely unwatchable.  This is supposed to convey a feeling of being inside the action, but it distracts just as much as it aids the anxiety or realism.  It is simply too overwrought to work completely.  Most action scenes take place among the ruins and highway structure of LA, so the bleak grays of stone and overpasses blend well with fractured windows and rampant explosions and fires.  The pace is frenetic and exciting.  Danger is palpable.  The tense action truly is the highlight; it's just too bad the cameraman from Cloverfield was working the scene.<br /><br />Alien invasion films have been done better and worse, and this film breaks little new ground.  In the end this falls somewhere below the greats in this genre, and typical, brainless popcorn flicks like Bayformers.<br /><br />Jason Elinfilming in far too many instances was completely unwatchable.

B002ODEJYE|5.0|If anyone saw her 'Glitter in the Air' performance on the Grammy's surely then has an idea of how talented this girl is.  Pink truly delivers on this show. Her voice, stamina and stage all get an A grade. Truly entertaining. The Blu-ray has amazing picture quality as well and great sound. Don't miss this Pink Fans!! A great treat that you'll surely enjoy.
0765348276|4.0|The first novel of John Scalzi, Old Man's War, is a good, solid, entertaining and thought-provoking science fiction story reminiscent of the old master Heinlein. There are space battles, many alien races, \\"enhanced\\" humans and many philosophical concepts all wrapped into this tight and readable package of a novel.    Sometimes the dialog is too long and tends to get off track. This happened a few times, and I simply got on with it by skimming forward a few pages. One thing I missed was more description of the aliens. Some have slasher arms, others thoraxes, some are spider-like, others are mammalian and less than an inch tall, so they can be stomped to death like cockroaches. I felt that the alien philosophies and technologies were so central to the story, it would have helped if Scalzi had described them better and left less to the imagination.    I don't usually say this, but this book could have been a hundred pages longer, filled with more description, and not suffered in terms of readability.    I am now looking forward to the other three books of the \\"Old Man\\" series which are already out and available.
B0036TGSIK|2.0|The premise sounds engaging enough an adoption of Nathaniel Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter with a teenage edge. Even better the cast is full of solid names from Emma Stone, Patricia Clarkson, Thomas Hayden Church, Lisa Kudrow, among others, but this movie comes across as more than a little disappointing. Where it tries to deliver the good message of being careful about the lies you spread, it seems to turn into something of a crude human sex joke complete with gay guys pretending to be straight, friends who change at the drop of a hat, teachers having affairs with students, something just misses very badly and it turns into something that is not really particularly amusing or funny, but rather as something that passes as boring and unmemorable. While certainly not the worst movie I've ever seen, it kind of just passed without any feeling or reaction from me. Maybe I'm just too old for the alleged humor in this movie.
B000YAA68C|5.0|When Gerry (Gerard Butler) finds out he doesn't have much time left to live, he plans a sort of scavenger hunt for his beloved wife Holly (Hilary Swank). A few weeks after he passes away, Holly gets the first surprise in the mail, and each surprise leads to another letter from her deceased husband. Some of Gerry's messages force her to go out and spend time with her friends, thereby taking her out of mourning and letting her enjoy everything beautiful about life that she had forgotten about.<br /><br />Indeed, I thought it was a beautiful story. I know some reviewers said it was very predictable, and while you do get the idea that Holly is slowly moving on to bigger and better things, the story is not that obvious otherwise. At times, Holly feels like relapsing and going back to depression; at other times, we find out a surprise about herself or one of her friends. People who love romantic comedies will find this movie adorable; people who do not will still find it bearable.<br /><br />And the concept behind what Gerry did is great too. Surprises for a sad person can be helpful in lifting them up. And while you shouldn't cling on to the past too tightly, letters from a loved one who is gone are a wonderful keepsake to remember them.
B004M6BQ9W|5.0|I can add little to the other reviews here other than to say that I'm waiting for an extended version that adds more song/dance numbers!!!!!! EXCELENT!!!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Soooo good it gives me goosebumps! Seldom does a CD hit me so hard on the first listen, this one I knew after one listen that its going to be played over and over for quite some time in my car, home and ipod!!! Love it!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I had to give this book five stars because it was beautifully written. However, it was so disturbing that I didn't really want to.<br /><br />My genre of choice is usually true crime, but even so, this work of fiction was just too much for me. The writing is so good that it's easy to get emotionally involved with the characters, who are in a tragic and hopeless situation.<br /><br />If you are prone to any kind of depression, I wouldn't suggest you read this. I'm finding it hard to get past this story due to the unfortunate knowledge that there are places in the Middle East where people actually live like this. It's so hard to know that women and girls in this culture don't stand a chance. They can't make the choice to leave. They are there for life. It's just so unimagineably sad.
B004MMEIK0|2.0|The one thing that bother me the most was the CONSTANT and VERY FREQUENT use of the words \\"God's Blood\\". This drove me insane and took away from the already sketchy storyline. The heroine of this book at many of times just downright got on my nerves. Sparks tried to make her both strong and independant while still making her seem fragile and incompetent and after a while it was just too much.One of the other things that aggravated was towards the end where Roman tells the villian is whole plan of attack. Ridiculous. The story could have been great but the execution was less than favorable. It took to long for things to happen and once things did happen it quickly ended. I was hoping for so much more and hope here other books will be better executed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have heard good reviews of this series and I finally gave in and read them. I am so glad I did. This is one of my favorite series I have ever read. I couldn't stop reading, it was so addicting. I found myself wanting to know more and more. I couldn't have been happier. I love the surprises and all the details. I will recommend this series to everyone I know.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|The response was prompt.  The movie is delightful.  Wish that they would make more movies like this one.
0761129235|5.0|Received this is a gift, and It's been helping me shift my lifestyle to cope with my bipolar disorder.    I've now been running five times a week for the last month, and drinking more water every day.  I feel great.  The next step is to tackle my poor sleep habits.    i was skeptical at first--self help books can often be overwhelming.  This is book makes it so easy to start changing; it's pretty spectacular.    Great book!
031603438X|4.0|I got my husband a Kindle for Christmas and I had this book downloaded for him.  He takes his Kindle to work and reads it during down time.  He really enjoyed this book and in fact, read portions to me every evening.  Who knew Keith was not only a great musician but such an interesting guy too?  Good read even if you are not a big Stones fan.
0783240236|5.0|I viewed this fine movie for the first time in a long, long, while, just at the time of the 8.9 earthquake in Japan, March 2011, occurred. After watching this movie I realized how prescient it actually was and the similarity of subject matter. The theme in The Birds is the awesome power of nature and how utterly defenseless and futile humankinds' effort to control it once something out of the ordinary occurs. The same futility of the citizens of Bodega Bay in battling the crazed birds can be experienced directly and in real time when watching how news videos of the tsunami created by the Japan 2011 earthquake simply swept away houses, big rigs, airplanes, everything in its path, like a gigantic broom sweeping dirt. In addition, this movie was made during the Cold War, during the Cuban Missle Crisis to be exact,and that feeling of omninousness and doom pervades the film. This movie is an overlook masterpiece of Hitchcock's, and based on current events and where humankind's abuse of the environment is leading, holds up very well.
0439023491|5.0|I was surprised to find this book even more exciting than the first HUNGER GAMES book! We bought all three of the HG books from Amazon (we bought both paper and KINDLE versions); Amazon has great prices and wonderful service. Thankfully, the books came in a hurry--once you start the first book, you do not want to wait to read the others.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I was really worried reading the prior reviews of this product that the discs wouldn't work.  But for the price, this product is the best deal if you intend to watch the full series in sequence--way less than if you bought all the individually-packaged seasons.    I became hooked on the series well after when new episodes stopped airing; on re-runs on the ABC Family network.  I started Netflix-ing DVDs, but contemplated buying this DVD set because I was impatient with the disc delivery.  It took me about half a year, and I have finally worked my way to the last episode.  And I'd like to report that from at least Season 3 to the end of the series (Season 7), all discs worked for me with absolutely no problems.  The quality of audio/visual is comparable to the discs sold in the individual season sets.    I also think the packaging is cute, like one of those 70's plastic doll case sets.  The case is pretty handy; taking up much less space than if you bought individual season sets.  Though some have noted the cardboard cases may not protect the discs well from scratches, I've carried many of the individual season folders while traveling with no issues.  I intend to watch the series again, and am very happy that the quality of this product will enable me to do so.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As a long-time sci-fi fan, I was sadly disappointed upon my first viewing of an episode of \\"Star Trek\\" -- I thought the writing pedestrian -- at best -- characters of cardboard -- and story lines that smacked of 1930s-ish development of the written genre. The excitement behind the \\"Star Trek\\" phenomena was quite beyond me. On the other hand, I was nailed to the set during my first encounter with \\"Firefly\\": not only were the writing, characters and story lines first rate sci-fi, but music, photography, et al, were very professionally done. They very cleverly let you know that Chinese Mandarin was the language of the future [prophetic!], and dropped hints of the technology that allowed \\"Firefly\\" to be furnished like an apartment house, with people sitting and walking about as the ship gyrated through space. The \\"space cowboys\\" is an interesting twist -- makes me wonder if one of the show's creators was familiar with the old \\"Captain Video\\" sci-fi series aired back in the dawn of the TV age, in which the producers, in order to fill out running time, would insert action via the \\"Video Rangers\\" -- actually old B-cowboy flicks run as serial. But while horses might make sense on a backwater planet, revolvers don't. I assume they were put in to compliment the western theme, but semi-auto pistols would have done as well. [Obviously, the show's creators never tried to reload a revolver in the middle of a fire fight.]
1591843790|5.0|When I received this book in the mail, I wasn't sure what to expect.    I was worried that it might be another feel-good book with no practical advice.    Fortunately, I was wrong.    Yes, you will feel good after reading this book.     But unlike so many others of this type, it also offers practical advice to help you improve your business, whatever that business may be.    My favourite chapters are in the middle of the book: How to Launch, How to Overcome Resistance and How to Make Enchantment Endure.    Some of the advice given in these chapters are absolutely priceless for rolling out a successful product, service or whatever it is you as an entrepreneur sell.     I highly recommend picking this book up and more importantly, putting the info to work for you.
0767817478|4.0|Godzilla gets a lot of hate but it's a really good movie. It is nothing at all like the original Godzilla, but if you take it for what it is you'll really like this movie. It's directed by Roland Emmerich who is the master of disaster movies and is sporting a decent enough cast. Where Godzilla really succeeds though is the scenes of the giant lizard rampaging through New York City causing chaos and destroying things. I know that all old school Godzilla fans will hate this but if you're just looking for a good fun movie to watch that will pass time you should check this out.
B000000WGL|5.0|\\"Talk Is Cheap\\" was released in 1988...it's now 2011, so there is no need to confuse the dear reader by laying out new \\"opinions\\" and discussing the material on this CD.  Suffice it to the say; THIS IS THE BEST \\"ROLLING STONES\\" ALBUM SINCE 1974, when Mick Taylor left the group...and yeah, he's on here, too.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I love everything about the collection. What's not to love? It has a blu-ray with loads of bonus features, a DVD version with a reasonable about of bonus features, and for now, a digital copy of the film - which you must download from itunes, or windows media, etc. It's free, and that's never a bad thing. The only thing that I'm slightly bummed out about are that many of the bonus features are in standard definition. That being said, there are a ton of bonus features and there is always something new to explore. There are also multiple commentaries that are enjoyable to listen to -- Not like Shawn Levy's boring commentary for Date Night. I mean, seriously, How many times did that guy use the word \\"Literally?\\"    Anyway, buy the blu-ray. Buy it on Amazon.com and save some money. It's worth it, either way.
B0049P1ZZQ|1.0|Its A Very Good Show. But just to give everyone a heads up. Out of the 2 disk Blu-ray set they have episodes 1-4(ON BLU-RAY)on the first disk, which is great! But the second disk is not a Blu-ray at all... Its a regular dvd with episodes 5-6(DVD) on it... I mean what gives???? Anchor Bay pulled a fast one and I fell for it.. I don't buy dvds anymore because I live in the year 2011 and own a 2011 HD tv.. They could of at least put the information on the box for crying out loud.. I paid for a Blu-Ray 2 disk set. And the result was that I didn't get what I thought I was paying for.. This is a rip off...
157421327X|5.0|I bought Zentangle Basics, and Zentangle 2, 3, and 4 at the same time.     Zentangle Basics is a very basic book. It has lots of good, simple tangles, a summary of Zentangling, some examples, and some fun applications. It also explains how to start shading your tangles.     If you are wanting a complete library of Zentangle books this would be a worthwhile addition. I plan to keep this book around to loan to beginners who are new to the concept because it would be perfect for that, plus this book would also be great to include for classroom activities, group activities, etc. It's not too involved while explaining everything to give you a good foundation plus patterns to start out with.     Also, I have to say:     1. yes, it only has a \\"few\\" pages compared to most art books. But it's listed on the Amazon listing that it's only 20 pages, so why people give it low ratings for that reason boggles my mind. Also, Zentangling is supposed to be a simple concept that doesn't require much explaining - it's about the patterns and the activity itself.     2. Yes, you can find patterns online, but I don't like being tied to my computer when I want to tangle. I'm still relatively new to tangling and I need references and ideas, and the time/ink/paper that it would take to print everything out would far surpass paying $8.99 for the number of tangles in the book. Also, by buying the book you are supporting an independent artist that loves what they do.
B000050WZY|5.0|We received this in plenty of time to give it to her for her birthday. It was in great condition and was everything the seller said it would be.
0596805888|5.0|This was purchased for my husband as a Christmas present.  My husband is a disciple of Alton Brown's and this seemed like the perfect gift for the science-oriented cook.  Needless to say, as soon as he unwrapped the present, he buried his nose in the book and only emerged long enough to tell us some new factoid.  This book really illuminates the science behind cooking, and is a great present/ reference for anyone who wants to \\"why\\" in relation to their cooking.
B004P02OJ6|5.0|Great movie overall.   I could do without the way the cops were portrayed as just instinctively knowing everything.. but other that that the movie was great.
B000F2C87Q|5.0|I am so thankful for Pandora introducing The Black Keys AND Junior Kimbrough to me in 2009 and very pleased to see them getting some more media attention lately - 2 Grammys!?!?!?!!  Awesome.  This album is what good music is all about to me.  It captures so much and there is a LOT of history behind it in both Junior and The Keys' influence by him and you can feel it in every note.<br /><br />Thank you so much for making this EP.  It's among the best blues, best rock and best overall albums in my extensive collection.
0451169514|5.0|This book is incredibly good however I would give it 4 and a half stars if I knew how! It is such a good read, vivid imagery, shocks constantly and it will scare you regardless of age (I'm 21). My only problem with the book is it could be 200-300 pages shorter I feel and sometimes it is a bit drawn out. Nearly everything does tie in, in some way but some of the histories and derry interludes are a bit monotonous when you are eager to get back to the story. The ending was great but I was still a bit dissapointed, a tad anti-climatic I felt. However, ignoring these small problems, it is a terrific book. Buy this, you will love it.
B000TSIK14|5.0|I finally picked this album up after almost 4 years of debating on whether I should get it.  I am very pleased that I did.  I have followed these guys for years, and have bits from all parts of their catalog, and I am disappointed I did not pick this up earlier.  After hearing Humanity on XM the other day, I revisited the album online again and finally picked the hard copy up.  From the opening track Hour 1 with Johnny 5, it set up the album and pulled me through with much of the guitar and melody licks you would expect, but a crisp production edge that makes this sound very different from other albums.  There is some type of theme of human morals/regrets/missed opportunities/demise of civilization/and time in general running out, but it is not a concept album.  My favorite tracks are Hour 1, Humanity, The Cross, and We Were Born to Fly.  Desmond Child has done a fine job with the production. Klaus's voice has not sounded aged at all, no cracking and electronic modulation needed. This has a nice progressive rock sound to it.   A nice introduction for new listeners, and a new take for old listeners like myself.
1594202842|5.0|I finished this book after just a few hours. I had read the article about the book in Time magazine, watched an interview of Amy Chua online, and read quite a few of the reviews about the book on this website. I was extremely curious about the book and I am very glad I read it for myself. You definitely cannot base your opinion on this book without reading it first--with an open mind.  Reviewers who are so adamantly critical of Amy Chua as a parent should really get over themselves. From page one to page 229, the author has started to question her beliefs and actions. I have no doubt that ANYONE who has any kind of relationship with anyone else has had moments of realization that perhaps they haven't done all that they can do to be the kind of person, or parent, they want to be. I feel this acutely as a parent myself. A friend once told me that it's too bad we can't parent in reverse, since we make so many mistakes along the way and learn only after we've made those mistakes. This book is about so much more than \\"child abuse,\\" as our Western value system defines it. I certainly hope that readers will learn from her mistakes. I have no doubt that she thought she was being the best parent possible for her children. She very definitely spent a great deal of time with her children. I find it admirable that she is willingly exposing her parenting techniques for criticism.  This book is first and foremost a memoir, not a parenting book. I laughed out loud and read passages out loud so often that my family pretty much ran away to other parts of the house. Ms. Chua has an uncanny gift of sarcasm and ability to laugh at herself, and she is definitely honest about herself. It's kind of like watching \\"Grand Torino,\\" with Clint Eastwood--you hate to laugh at the crotchety old man, but you can't help it. She definitely has some pretty strong opinions. If you read between the lines it's quite obvious that her family finds humor in her as well. I think her girls are pretty amazing. They may have had a \\"tiger mother,\\" but they are not afraid to speak their minds. They obviously know that they can express themselves to their mother, sometimes with vehemence. I'm not saying they are disrespectful, just confident in themselves and that she'll love them no matter what they say to her.  I don't find any mention of her sister, her mother-in-law or the dogs in most of these reviews. They are secondary characters, but provide poignant glimpses inside the lives of this family, and are more than likely the reason she starts to realize she may be on the wrong track with some of her parenting beliefs. My favorite chapter was about Popo, where Ms. Chua openly admits that she butted heads with her mother-in-law by \\"criticizing and railing against her to Jed behind her back,\\" but then takes her into her home because there is no other option in her opinion if you're going to do what's right.  I cannot close this review without commenting that we can't get caught up in what offends us about her parenting techniques. She has a valid point that we can expect more of our children than we do, and we owe it to them to believe in them and encourage them to work hard to achieve their goals and dreams, whether they are aware of them or not. Someone commented in our local paper that perhaps we are overdoing the praise when he noticed so many discarded certificates after an award assembly at the school. Praising the smallest achievements provides no benefit when they go out on their own and those rewards are no longer there. As Temple Grandin says, kids need to find what they are good at and develop their strengths. Whether they are being rewarded for that or not is irrelevant in the scheme of long-term success.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I just sat down with a large group of friends and family and we watched the whole series (6 episodes across 2x Blu-Ray discs) this past Saturday.  People came for a birthday party but I turned it into a video-fest.  Everybody loved it, from 10-year-old kids to 50-year-old couples, we all enjoyed this show!  There are some violent scenes (Zombies!) but only one sexual adulteress scene, and the scary parts are quick, so the kids didn't freak out.  Most of the time is spent on the surviving humans and their drama.  Little details are kept across episodes, like the grenade, bag of guns, etc.    If you love Sunday nights on HBO, Showtime, and Starz with their high-end series like Soporanos, The Wire, Spartacus, etc. then you will love The Walking Dead.  AMC, who knew?    Normally I only buy movies on disc, but after loving this purchase I will look to buy more series on disc.    I am also an avid collector of guns...a newish hobby that started when the USA went crazy and I lost a few hundred thousand dollars in the stock market.  This show demonstrates the point, best to keep a bunch of shotguns and pistols nearby just in case!
B0043VDIAG|5.0|Awesome book, story of survival at all cost. Just when she felt she was finally free, reality comes back to haunt her. Loved the book,,,one I will re-read again,
B0001I561E|5.0|Received dvd very quickly, its a gift for a birthday next month so not opened yet, but again looks great and happy I could get it, thanks
B000001H00|5.0|For the combination of gorgeous compositions and indescribably superb performance, this is the greatest CD I know.<br /><br />I know it's a trite thought exercise, but if I could only take one CD to that desert island exile, it would be this one; if I could take only one movement, it would be the Ciaccona of Milstein's D Minor Partita.<br /><br />I listen to a lot of recordings in all genres by many, many artists -- but this is as close to the perfect recording as I've ever encountered.<br /><br />I tend only to review items I really like or really dislike, but I can't like an item more than I like this CD set, nor could I ever rate anything else as highly.
0316067938|1.0|Really enjoyed the other books in the series, but this book was a bloated piece of crap meant to make money and nothing more. Both the story and Character Arch's fall flat on their faces, and Meyer breaks every rule that she set up about her world-which is the only fantasy/paranormal no-no. The first three are worth a read, but the last is not. 900 pages for nothing, Bella and Edward have a baby (ignore how this makes no sense) and they DONT fight the bad guys there ya go saved you 900 pages.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|My wife gave me this knife for Christmas and I will say that it is everything that I had hoped for.  I have used it for some cutting and chopping and the blade is still in great shape.  The coating is a little scuffed (expected), but the blade is just as sharp as when it came out of the box.  Impressive slab of knife.
0385732554|5.0|I love this book, it is such a short read but soo great. I love the story, love the way it unfolds, and love the ending (though I pretend that they actually died on the journey though we find out this is untrue in the messenger)I really like Lois Lowry as an author. Her stories are so original and she tells them so well. Most of the books that I read resemble dictionaries so it is nice to go back to this, or of mice and men and remember that a really amazing story can be told, and have a profound effect on you, in fewer pages than you might think necessary.
B000002NFM|4.0|Their previous album \\"Music For The Jilted Generation\\" is incredible. I didn't think it could be topped. \\"Fat Of The Land\\" does it, barely. It's an excellent mesh of electronica, metal and pop, that's just heavy enough to sound almost industrial on some tracks. This had three huge singles from it, but could have had three more I'd say. \\"Smack My Bitch Up\\", \\"Breathe\\" and \\"Firestarter\\" still sound impressive even in 2011. They all made the Singles collection and rightly so, but the remaining tracks alone make this disc essential. Not many albums in any genre are solid front to back. This is, and it somehow gets better as the years pass.
031603438X|5.0|It took me a couple of weeks to get through this absolutely fascinating 550-page tome. I have been a fan of the Rolling Stones since about 1964 when I first heard Satisfaction and in the late 1980s, I attended a Stones concert at the Oakland, California Coliseum so I was really looking forward to reading this and I was not disappointed. I found it to be very informative and exceptionally written. Richards tells it all from his childhood and being a boy scout, to meeting Mick Jagger and forming the Rolling Stones along with Brian Jones, to his falling out with Mick, his extensive use of drugs, and his many close encounters with death. I especially enjoyed how Richards described his musicianship and his use of \\"open tuning\\" a guitar using 5 strings to get totally different sounds. Very enjoyable and highly recommended to anyone who is a Stones fan or rock music buff.
B000GFLAI0|4.0|I'm no Dylan expert, but this album is just extraordinary. It's the first of his I've gotten since Oh Mercy and might be my favorite of his EVER. The quality of songs is very high, and the whole album is very consistent. I've played it countless times and it just doesn't get old. Highlights are the opener, the closer, and everything inbetween. Seriously. I've seen him live twice in the past 4-5 years and it's been...alright. He's hard to understand live, and both shows I saw tended to drag a bit. Not here. Crisp, clear and very enjoyable. Decades in the \\"biz\\" and still on top. What would we do without him, Springsteen and Neil Young? Step it up youngsters.
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. From beginning to end you are hooked. Beautifully acted by James Franco. The ending is freaking beautiful. The part where he actually does the deed is stunningly disgusting. Well done. Please watch!!!
B004CLYKLI|3.0|I thought this book was entertaining. The author's constant push to make her children excel in music and in the classroom was refreshing. However, the author became obsessed with forcing her children to excel in music without planing  a music career for the children. The author planned every minute of the children's time without giving the children an opportunity for self expression. In fact, her youngest daughter rebelled against the author at the age of 13. Because the children did not complete high school,the audience is left wondering if  the author's parenting skills raised successful and happy adults. Finally, I do not know how the author's husband permitted his wife to exercise parenting skills that were in complete contrast to his upbrining. Overall, the author presents a funny and entertaining book whether you agree or disagree with her parenting style.
B000065V41|4.0|I own both the VHS and DVD versions of this film.  Why on earth did they remove the poignant and moving song of \\"letting go\\" that Michael Caine's young fiance sings when he keeps making excuses for not marrying her and he realizes what he's lost?  Are people not supposed to regret anything?  Are people not supposed to weep over their mistakes?  For me, that segment makes the movie.  So I watch the DVD up to that point (because it's clearer and sharper than the VHS), and then I switch over to the VHS version to see and hear the segment that was cut from the \\"new\\" DVD.
159562015X|5.0|It's a quick read and includes an easy to uese survey and website that buyers will want to reference often to get the full benefit.

B004Q3UL2O|3.0|i had high expectations for this movie.  i figured with these actors it has to be great.  well, i was disappointed.  the acting was good as expected.  i just thought it would be more comical than it was. it was predictable and it wasn't fun.  like i said i expected more than what i got.  my fault.
B000FC2PKG|5.0|This book captured me from the start and kept me reading the whole day. Suspense, twists and turns and suspense gallore. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants an exceptional read.
B0048IMZMG|2.0|I just didn't connect to this album like I did the other ones. Some good songs but just not as great!
0312944926|3.0|It is amply evident from reading this book that Mr. Brown is not a  mathematician, cryptographer, or a computer scientist.  The volume is rife  with errors in all the three domains.  Combinations and permutations of  numbers are plain wrong; Mr. Brown appears to be impervious to the difference  between a key exchange protocol versus an encryption protocol; he is  equally indifferent to the dissimilarities between a compiled language versus  an interpreted one, a bit versus a byte, his mangled history of the  origins of Internet is amusing, and ... I could go on.  However, Mr.  Brown is exponentially more richer than I am, so he must be doing  something right.    That said, the story is about a massive computer tucked deep in the  bowels of NSA that can break any encryption algorithm except the  algorithm that the computer does not know that it has broken even though  the algorithm has been broken (get it?).  Sort of amusing.  For a long  time in encryption, cryptographers have made the case that knowing the  decryption key will not help if the message itself is yet another  code.  Consider, for instance, two burglars sending encrypted messages  to each other on where they will strike next.  Even if their communication  was decrypted and said \\"Mary had a little lamb\\", law enforcement are  no more in the know than before regarding the next target.    Anyway, so the massive NSA computer continues churning, burning itself  up in the process while NSA recruits a university professor to find the  key.  The professor travels to Spain (which is presented as a very  backward country bereft of modern conveniences such as dependable phone  lines), while his girlfriend aids NSA in recovering the key back in  the US.  Oh, the girlfriend is a brilliant cryptographer employed by the  NSA.  There are more auxiliary characters and side stories (McGuffins, is  what Hitchcock called these) but the ending is a rather pedantic love  triangle.  It is a quick read, amusing at times, but don't take everything  you read in the book seriously.  If you want to really find out about  the context under which a writer sets a story, read Michael Crichton   instead.
B003Y3ZTGA|4.0|I didn't think I would like this CD as much as I did. It is really fun. love \\"last Friday night\\"...\\"ET\\" and \\"circle the drain!\\"
1584233494|5.0|As a studio artist I enjoy having books around to keep me motivated and inspired.  This is one of those books.  Mine is the original red cover version but as far as I know its the same as this with a different cover.  Great art and well put together.  Any artist can appreciate Shepard's work.
B004NYQYNQ|3.0|I had very high expectations for this album and I absolutely LOVE \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" but after the first few songs it just starts to sound the same.  Adele's voice is fabulous and smokey but it becomes the same after awhile and the songs start sounding alike. I had a good friend who considered Amy Winehouse to be a great talent but all I hear is a voice ravaged by drug addiction.  Adele should quit smoking, wise up and quit being so bitter.  I think her music would benefit from a little more experience. People are praising her so much right now and I think she'll hit her peak about four albums in. Not quite there, my dear, but you'll get there soon.
B000V9D5LG|4.0|Don't get me wrong, this is a great lens.  Its just not worth the money it sells new for.  You can readily find this lens on this site and your local Craigslist for under $200 most anytime.  That said, its worth that price but not the $300+ it sells for new.  Works well and is well made.
B0002DB0FO|3.0|I love the show but the packaging of the dvds was cheaply done no fault of the people selling them just letting you know they might come in not the best condition when they are shipped.  I got mine and the plastic was a bit cracked and the plastic \\"pages\\" holding the dvds were coming unglued from the binding this disappointed me but all it ruined was the presentation of it my dvds were still in perfect condition.  If the packaging were better it would be 5 stars but i can only give it 3 due to the condition it was received in.  Overall the show is about two families of doctors in a small town.  Its very low key and not too dramatic.  Its a family show overall sometimes its a little slow, but it has great values lessons and great characters.  Its one of my favorite shows i am very happy to now own season one :)
1416914285|3.0|I read very frequently and this book wasn't original, Clary first off I agree with other reviews was too perfect and it did resemable Harry Potter. Secondly, every book always makes the main character have a evil father who's off to slay the world, not every book but most. Also, @ the comment where Jace and Clary are related, the other should of SERIOUSLY thought that threw.
0345472322|5.0|If this book addresses your problem -- as it did with me -- then it's invaluable. I find her basic idea extremely plausible and it explains a lot that otherwise was not easy to figure out. Thanks to this book I am making the transition from someone who would bail out of learning/working at the first sign of imperfection and adversity to a stronger person who can embrace and overcome a challenge, and I have a better chance of raising emotionally resilient kids as well.     Five stars and recommended if you or someone you care about is stuck and feels unable to move forward in any important facet of their life, including studying, working, relationships.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag hold my camera two lenses, flahs, chargers, batery, everything for a formal photography job. Maybe not for professional use but it can take all your photography stuff.
0756405890|5.0|Most of the other good reviews sum up my feelings pretty well, so I'll just add one thing:    It was pleasurable to finally read a fantasy that didn't have the \\"brooding reluctant hero\\". Kvothe recognizes his natural abilities, and seeks to utilize them, rather than run from them or feel saddled with the burden of them. I tire of those type of heroes as they do not reflect the nature of any individual I have ever come across. Having started out dirt poor and used my own talents to gain higher and higher levels of education, I immediately felt a kinship with this character. He strives to better himself, without relying on others, and that is sorely lacking in literature and society today.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|I guess I was a \\"Tiger Mom\\" and didn't know it! I was  raised with strict expectations, and did the same with my own children. I once brought home a C in Geometry on an otherwise straight A grade card.  My father looked at it and said, \\"Why didn't you just go on and flunk the class?\\" I never made another C in my educational career.  Children live up to expectations.  I think very many americans have low or no expectations for their children.    My children were honor students,they have advanced degrees and are working in their careers.  They also participated sucessfully in after school activities of their own choosing. They were self motivated to be achievers.   As my son once put it at a championship wrestling meet\\"second place is the first loser!\\"  Also my children didn't do drugs and did not have any out of wedlock children.  We as a culture have lowered our academic and moral standards so far that we need a wake up call such as this book. Children live up to your expectations. Self esteem is earned, not given.  I see my grand children being raised by my daughter-in-law with the current typical laissez faire attitude and despair because they are bright children with so much potential but children need direction and incentives. My son brought home a less than sterliing grade in English right after returning from Xmas break. I unplugged his new Xmas nintendo and put it in the garage.  I said, \\"It must rot your brain.  You can have it back when you grade improves.\\"  He even brought hisw friends over to see it was really gone! I was the meanest old mom in the world.  However, his english teacher who was a friend, asked me \\"What did you do to your son?\\" He was now doing all his assignments well and asking for extra credit work.  Needless to say he got his nintendo back after the next grading period. I think a bit more Tiger and little less pussycat mothering would not hurt our children or our nation.
B000KGGLCU|2.0|Was looking forward to receiving this dvd but unfortunately it is not good.The cd is fine but the dvd constantly jumps throughout the concert.Not watchable.
B004I2K4DY|4.0|The production was very well done, and I am happy that I watched it.  However, I am so glad that I own the 1998 ORIGINAL 10th anniversary Dream Cast DVD, which I purchased any years ago.  What I really liked about the 10th Anniversary production is that the big screens in the back had information introducing the scenes, so it was easier for those who don't know the story line to follow what was going on.  Also, those screens showed scenes from the play, so there was a lot more impact - especially when it showed the barricade from one of the plays when there were so many deaths.  There was just too much left out of this production.  Plus, Nick Jonas simply did not have the vocal range needed for Marius; he was the weak link in this production.  I am wondering why he was chosen to do this part (?)    UPDATE:  I just discovered that the ORIGINAL 10th Anniversary 1998 DVD release of \\"Les Miserables - The Dream Cast in Concert\\"  is no longer available new.  It is available used on Amazon from third party sellers for over $100.00!  I understand that the subsequent releases of this DVD are not nearly as good in quality as the original and also have some parts missing.  So, if you happen to own the original (as I do), take good care of it, unless you want to spend a lot of money to replace it!  Also, this original can be rented from Netflix.
B004H1YH66|3.0|I, like many others, am a genuine fan of Poledouris' original score to the film. I grew up on it. I think we shouldn't be so quick to dismiss the original recordings just because we now live in a Hi-Def society. It is true that the original had flaws.... some precision problems with the orchestra, tuning issues from time to time. I will even acknowledge those who report that Poledouris himself said that he was unhappy with the final product due to limitations in players and orchestration editing. Here's my take on the new recording...    THE PROS...    Obviously, the quality of sound here is EXCELLENT. The fidelity in which the music was recorded is second to none. Advances in audio engineering, microphones, and production allow us to hear each section of the orchestra with immense clarity.    It is also a gem to finally hear EVERY measure that was composed brought to life in this 2-CD set. Before the release of this recording, the only obtainable recordings of the original unreleased tracks were bootlegs of very poor quality (it would be SOOO nice to have all the original tracks remastered). Tracks such as \\"Pit Fights\\", \\"Discipline of Steel\\" (here called \\"Prologue\\") are now displayed with the same clarity and fidelity as every other track. Even some of the music that seemed during the film to be incidental... it's all here.    The orchestrations of Greg McRitchie also give a new glimpse as to what the original intent of each track was to be. Sometimes, right online with what was recorded for the film, other times, slight variations that add a touch of color never heard before. Click tracks have been the cause of many scores being edited. It is refreshing to have those restraints removed here.    THE CONS...    In many ways, this recording reflects that of a symphony orchestra performing the work of one of the great classical composers. I can listen to a recording of Beethoven's 5th played by Chicago, New York Phil, Cleveland, and St. Louis orchestras, and each rendition will sound different. I'll even say there are noticeable differences in that same work by the SAME orchestra under different conductors. Each interprets the music in a different way. Such is the case here, but because it's a film score, I feel it's a bit of a violation. Raine's tempi are sometimes rushed and hurried, which in my opinion, ruins the dramatic effect of the scene the music was written for (Gift of Fury, for example was almost a BLUR because Raine rushed through this selection). The original interpretation (conducted by the COMPOSER mind you), drew out the emotion of the scene in a way that truly gave it LIFE. The music for the decapitation of Thulsa Doom (newly named \\"Head Chop\\") is the same. There is a deliberate accent for each note that, in the original version, was drawn out to convey the gravity of the scene. Raine runs through the entire sequence in the blink of an eye (I almost didn't recognize the music because he conducted those accents so quickly).     Another is the spotlight on thematic materials. Although the tracks contain the original music, in some places, the instruments are balanced in a way that completely dulls the original intent. Lines that were once signature are hardly heard. Other parts that were secondary are now, at times, overbearing. Again, the original interpretation (again, by the COMPOSER CONDUCTING) should have been the blueprint here). A few liberties were taken that just don't equate to the interpretation of the original.    Some instruments could not be reproduced. The \\"Wheel of Pain\\" section, for example, used a very convincing scraping metallic effect in the percussion section. On the new recording, it is a HORRIBLE rendition of a gong scrape combined with bowing the edge of the instrument... NOT EVEN CLOSE. If the score is to be re-recorded, research for this effect should have been more thoroughly researched (this is 30 years later, there are numerous resources available to achieve this).    Even though themusic is being re-created, the tempi, balance of parts, and expressive interpretation of the original should have been retained. In defense of this new recording, much of it is. It's just that a number of significant sections of this score have been altered creatively, which lessens the original intent of the music and scene it accompanied. Decades have sealed these interpretations in our minds and ears. It does not help the fact that Poledouris had passed away before this project was undertaken. Had he conducted both renditions, it would be easier to accept.    I will even defend, for a moment, the imperfections found in the original recordings. Again, we all grew up on this score. Every detail has stuck in our minds. Even the sprinkling of wrong notes, intonation, and precision have come to define the score. I think of comparisons to the jazz great Miles Davis. Many of his solos are riddled with cracks, wrong notes, and blanks of air pockets. To many who hold him in high regard, that was part of his style. His rawness at times was what gave those phrases LIFE. Many have transcribed his solos and played them with an execution that was polished and perfect in every way... and as a result PALES in comparison to the original solos Miles played. I hold the original recordings of the Conan score in the same regard. In some ways, it works better for me, because the story itself takes place before \\"civilization\\" was widespread. The instruments in the original recording sound a little more \\"raw\\" at times, which, for me, is appropriate.     All things considered, I am VERY thankful for this release, but it will never replace my desire to play the original recordings. If anything, it is a curious exploration to compare the two side-by-side at times, to hear the differences in the writing. This new set is definitely worth getting, just don't toss your original version. You'll be missing it over time if you do.
B001USHRCK|5.0|This Lego set includes many interesting features that add to the overall construction of the marketplace.<br /><br />As a previous reviewer stated, there are many accessories, such as the frog, carrot, cooked turkey-some of which you get to assemble yourself, but it is the detailed design of the buildings that make building the Medieval Marketplace fun. You will know what I mean once you get there.<br /><br />The moving parts are especially cool, and I like the pieces that allow the houses to be closed.<br /><br />Also, the bags are not labeled and pieces seemed to be grouped randomly. It was not a not a problem, though and it lets you exercise your organization skills.<br /><br />The only problem I recalled was that shipping took a while, but not longer than the expected time-frame.
1439102724|4.0|Picoult gets 5 stars for addressing a topic that is sure to come up if it hasn't already and for drawing attention to the fact that gay people still do not have the same rights as heterosexuals. It was a read that sucked me into the lives of people I had never read about before. I knew next to nothing about in vitro. I also thought using 3 voices in alternating chapters with different font was a useful way of writing this book. The font style changes help keep it all straight in the reader's mind.    The book only gets 3.5/4 stars, though, because it could have been much better, and I'm not just talking about the editing problems which run rampant. This is my first Picoult book so I don't know how she usually develops character relationships. In Sing You Home she should have spent more time on the dissolution of Max and Zoe's relationship and the development of Zoe's new relationship. It all seemed extremely sudden, especially the development of the new relationship. This was to the detriment of the story in my opinion and made it seem a little less realistic.    The characters often did/said things that added next to nothing to the story, such as Vanessa in the washroom with the lawyer. Also, Zoe's lawyer was next to worthless. She seemed shocked by everything like she expected the research to happen itself.    Picoult obviously did a lot of research for this topic but sometimes when she related it in the book it seemed like it was maybe unnatural for dialogue, even for a court case. After going into so much detail in some areas, at other points she is vague and assumes the reader knows what certain medical terms are. She mentioned 'D & C' several times without any explanation. Maybe it's just me, but I had to google it to find out what happened.      ****SPOILERS**** and questions for those who read the book.      I was not unsympathetic to the character of Zoe. It was horrible how many problems she had with getting pregnant. I just do not get why it's so important to have a baby that carries your genetic material. Zoe and Max didn't make much money and yet they tried 5 in vitro pregnancies in 5 years at $10,000 a pop. Zoe wanted to do it a 6th time with Max. This is huge debt for something that isn't a guarantee. (And when they divorced they agreed to each pay their own debt. They didn't say 50/50. They made it sound like they had separate $ accounts. To each his own, I guess.) And the in vitro was after 4 years or so of trying the 'old' way. At any point during this time they could have adopted a child (which I know is also expensive but usually ends up with you actually getting a child) if they really set their life on having one and then later tried in vitro again if they wanted to make another attempt at a child that was biologically theirs. This is just my opinion here, but I find this to be extremely selfish, not to mention detrimental to Zoe's body. I'm not against in vitro, I just think Zoe was going to the extremes. If she really wanted a child, she could have adopted one. There are plenty without homes. I'm sorry, but I feel more for a child who grows up alone in an orphanage or foster care than for a woman who can't have a child that is biologically hers. I'm not saying this to piss anyone off. I just want to understand the mindset. Maybe this extreme is rare in real life and Picoult just decided to write about it. Obviously Vanessa had no such issues. I know she wasn't aware one way or the other if she had fertility problems but she obviously wasn't so determined to have her own biological child that she disagreed to carrying Zoe's. It's not exactly the same thing, but it's similar.    And I don't see how Liddy was a viable option for carrying the embryos. It appears that she had had as much (non)success as Zoe. Liddy and Reid had actually gotten pregnant the non-scientific way several times but she couldn't carry to term. It seems she has no problem with the getting pregnant part, so why does she think it'll beany different trying to carry someone else's embryos to term? I've never read or researched anything about infertile couples before so maybe I just don't understand.     Comments?    EDIT: After reading some other reviews I wanted to add my own observations about something that keeps coming up. A lot of people are saying this book is biased against Christians. I'm a Christian and I was not offended. From my experience most Christians I've known have held the same beliefs as those in the book. This is unfortunate but it certainly isn't biased to portray the 5 or so Christians in the book that way. In real life it probably WOULD be a famous Christian legal team/lawyer vs. GLAAD or ACLU. It would be nice to see a Christian organization legally defending the equal rights of homosexuals but I don't see that happening in real life. Maybe Picoult could have put a group of Christians supportive of Zoe and Vanessa in the courtroom but it seems to me that there aren't many pro-gay rights Christians who vocally protest AS Christians so we see them as just more pro-gay rights supporters, whereas Christians opposing gay rights are very vocal about it being because they are Christians. I hope I'm making sense here. Also, Max changed his mind at the end and decided there was no reason Zoe and Vanessa shouldn't raise the kids. There also seemed to be some kind of relationship between Zoe, Vanessa, Sammy and Liddy at the end. So we see that not all Christians are one monolithic voice.    Also, it's absurd to say the other, non-Christian side was shown without faults. They also did some very unlikeable things. Zoe was extremely rude to Liddy back when she was married to Max. I thought she was unreasonable to think that she wouldn't encounter a reference to Jesus on Christmas in a Christian's home. She also had no intentions of even attempting a relationship with her sister-in-law because of her own stereotypes. This is not an attractive quality. Vanessa also was weird about the whole 'you've known me a few months, why don't I know everything about you' speech. These are far from perfect people. They just don't try to tell other people they shouldn't be married or raise kids or work around kids because of who they love. Picoult also inserts a pretty common lesbian stereotype - the U-Haul syndrome. Zoe and Vanessa become friends, fall in love, get married, and try to start a family almost all on the same day. At least it seems that way. People point to this as proof that lesbian relationships are not stable - they fall in and out of love fast. So no, the book is not perfect and Picoult could have done better on all points, but I think it was important to address all these issues anyway. Hopefully someone will do better in the future.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was amazing...but I have to say that it wasnt the best one.  The first book was by far the best one but this book, for me, is a close second.  I would of wanted the story to end differently but I wont ruin it for you...I would definitely recommend reading this book.
1591843790|5.0|I always like it when non-fiction books are written in a way that is:<br /><br />(1) engaging<br />(2) easy to read/understand<br /><br />Throughout the book, Guy's style is personal, more informal than formal, and is 100% focused on delivering indispensable advice to the reader. I especially enjoyed the chapters on how to use both 'push' and 'pull' technologies, as the overall core of Guy's advice is focused on positivity (for instance, the emphasis is on \\"providing value to others,\\" not \\"how to manipulate people via social media/technology/whatever\\"). I thought this was the most valuable aspect of the book, and am very appreciative of the wealth of knowledge Guy Kawasaki has shared (as I feel with several of Donald Trump's books, which I own also!).<br /><br />As an independent author/artist/non-conformist, branding image and brand identity are two business aspects I've always had a great interest in. ENCHANTMENT is certainly a great guide for anyone wanting to know about \\"the art of changing hearts, minds, and actions.\\"

I love the helpful tips at the beginning on how to change colors without showing, how to stop a motif from ruffling, etc.  Edie's directions are crystal clear and easy to follow.  This is a great book that opens up a world of possibilities for the creative junkie.

B002SR2PKG|5.0|This is going to be a short review, but basically Im saying that Stephen King has written some great books over his career but IT remains number 1 with me.    While reading IT for the 3rd time...I read it while listening to the Audiobook by Steven Weber and that made it that much better and more real! Steve Weber does an excellent job with all the characters voices and making each scene sound as real as possible. I felt like I was actually in the book and I did not want it to end.    5 stars easily for this book...and by the way I hate clowns...he made clowns very scary, lol

B004AHNIGM|5.0|Gregg has made an outstanding blues album.  It's called 'Low Country' for the origin of these kinds of songs.  Rythmic and toneful, they pull you into the beat until you are in harmony.  I enjoyed ALL the songs on the album!  These remind me of Richard Johnston's 'Hill Country Blues' and 'Official Bootleg'.  If you liked those, you will enjoy Gregg's newest effort!  Thanks for a great album, Gregg!
B004INHTK4|5.0|There's been a lot of negative hoopla about this book, mainly by people who miss the big picture and take it entirely too seriously.  Yes, it is a book about a rather extreme way of raising children, and yes Amy Chua happens to be a Western-educated, Chinese mother.  Yes, it is not a method of child-rearing that most in the Western world would understand or condone.  But the author herself recognizes all this and doesn't claim that her methods have worked well or are fool-proof. If anything, her own children are the perfect examples as to why such harsh ways of teaching kids have a 50/50 chance of producing the results that were initially hoped for.    When all is said and done, this is well-written and entertaining: she is alternately self-assured and  self-deprecating, and writes with humor.  Read it with an open mind, take it for what it is - a mother's lessons in child-raising - and have a laugh while you're at it.
4883191028|5.0|In the city I live and in the language classes I attend, this is the language book of choice. You can read the pros and cons in other well-written reviews so what I want to say is this: teaching English in Japan, one thing I realize is the enormous benefits of studying a second language (L2) solely in that language.     This book is written entirely in Japanese and it can be a chore to read without sufficient practice in hiragana. But the payoff is immense and definitely worth the time and effort. If you're going to learn Japanese, you should also learn hiragana. This book will help there and also give you a leg up on kanji.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|This was probably my most anticipated book of the year ... the FINAL chapter in the Fever Series.  If you have not read the previous books in the series go back and read those before this one.      To me this book definitely lived up to the hype I had given it and that is nothing short of a miracle.  More often than not things are a let down to what you imagine them to be.      I have never read a book that had SO many twists and turns that I had no idea what was going to happen.  Too often books continue a pattern and you can anticipate what will happen next. Not so with this book at all. I could not put it down because I was desperate to find out what happens next.      The beginning of the book I have to say scared the hell out of me.  Was so terrified of what had happened and was scared that it was irreversible.  Keep faith .... one never knows what to expect after all.  Cryptic much?  Don't want to give too much away.  The twists and turns continued all the way to the end.  You couldn't ask for a better suspense novel.  And best of all it resolved everything that you really need to know.  Sure, there is still one question unanswered but it doesn't leave you with a sense that you HAVE TO KNOW IT.  It is resolved in a way that you don't mind the not knowing.      All in all this is probably my favorite book ... definitely my fav romance series.  I cannot recommend this book enough.
B0045LSIRM|5.0|Not many artists are this good in the \\"bare\\" but Bryan can deliver! He has a mix of old and new on this album and I love every minute! Thanks for once again rocking my world!
0547258305|4.0|This book was diffrent than what I am use to reading. I love fluff and blossming romance. One of the best things about this book is its a stand alone book. You read it and your done with this story. No waiting a year for the second book and so on. So for that reason I really liked it. It's one of those books where I am very happy I read it but I wouldn't go out and recommend it to all my friends like I have some other YA books. However don't let my review sway you against it. If you have gone this far and are now looking at reviews to decide to buy this book. I would highley recommend purchasing it, I was very happy with the book.
B0040JHF28|5.0|It has been some decades since a German soprano emerged as a major Richard Strauss lieder exponenet - since Schwarzkopf and Janowitz, we had Popp, then Te Kanawa, Fleming, norman, Gruberova, Isokosi.<br />Here, Diana Damrau sung 22 Strauss lieders in one breath, showing to the world how Germans sing Strauss lieders.<br />Damrau and Thielemann employed slightly crisper tempi in majority of the songs. As in Morgen, the soprano tackles the verses in ultra-fine syncopated articulations, leaving the spot light to the violin solo, in a most authentic way of interpretation of this famous piece.<br />After 'graduating' from the Queen of Night, Damrau moves to bel canto, following the footsteps of Edita Gruberova. In Amor, Damrau again demonstrates her fearsome coloratura technique, reminding one of her celebrated portrayal of Zerbinetta in Ariadne auf Naxos.<br />The album ends with six Brentano Lieders, sung to critical acclaim in the past by Edita Gruberova.<br />Damrau succeeds admirably in this album in showcasing how Strauss should be sung - in the authentic manner.

B0041T52S6|3.0|Watched this movie last night.    Liked the concept: A not overly-confident guy falls for \\"the coolest girl at my party\\", and competes with all of her baggage.  Who, provided you've actually had relationships,  hasn't had to do THAT?     None of us, I dare say, have done so in comic book / video game format, however.      Visually, the movie was fantastic.  The day to day reality parts were fairly drab and slow paced, lots of walking and conversations whilst sitting around.  The scenes where he battled with the exes were colorful, and loud, and freneticly filmed.     I'm 43, and completely marked out for the video game and comic book influences.  Loved the scenes with the band playing as well.  the music was fantastic.     The League of Evil Exes was well done.  Interesting folks with great powers, defeated in intersting and fun manners.    Sneak the vegan a little half and half, play to hearthrob's ego, so that he ends up destroying himself.... cool.    So why only 3 stars?    The guts of the movie were only so-so.      Cera, when not surprisingly kicking ass, was kind of annoying.      I'm a mope, I'm dating a high school girl but not really, though I let her pay for our video games.... I share a bed with my gay roommate, have no job, bad hair, and no desire to really change any of these things... Oh, and I'm still shattered from a breakup a year ago, but don't think about how I treated other women very much.    No feeling for why Ramona decided to \\"hang out\\" with him in the first place, nor why Knives was so smitten.   Both of them could have done so much better.       If this was NOT so much fun, visually and musically, it would have been a very dull movie, with an unsympathetic main character.     Some secondary characters were fun, especially Cera's roommate, played by one of the Culkins. the rest of them did little but take up space on the screen.      Overall, very creatively done movie about... not much.      But the creativity and homages to video games and comic books was enough for me.  Barely.
B000001FFR|5.0|Anthrax's was now on a major label when Island issued their second LP `Spreading the Disease' in the fall of 1985. Vocalist Joey Belladonna had debuted with the band on the `Armed and Dangerous' EP earlier in that same year but now he would have a whole record under his belt and Anthrax would take their rightful place among the leaders of the thrash metal movement. This record is a truly great metal album for this particular time period as much of the traditional metal bands had got sucked into the corporate realm in which a dumbing down of lyrics and the introduction of pop friendly keyboards were fast becoming the trend. \\"A.I.R.\\", \\"Lone Justice\\" and \\"Madhouse\\" open up the LP in grand frantic style and would be a hard act to follow for any band to follow. \\"Armed and Dangerous\\" is also present here in slightly different form than its namesake EP and \\"SSC/Stand or Fall\\" combines that just the right amount of melody and thrash mayhem that may have set Anthrax apart from their contemporaries. They did have Belladonna who was unique among the singers in the genre because he did have a sense of melody and dynamics that made many of Anthrax's songs so listenable along with the chant choruses. Eventually Joey's style and the Ian/Benante's songwriting started to not mesh as well but that was more toward the end of the decade. `Spreading the Disease' deserves to be on the shelf of any self respecting metal head and should be seen as one of the key records of the thrash movement.

B002ZG977Y|1.0|\\"The 1981 original boasted Ray Harryhausen's legendary stop-motion technique of animating various mythological creatures--it was his final feature project--and given the cornball approach of the movie in general, that was the main draw.\\" This is the opening quote from the Amazon.com review and description of this Hi-Tech Turkey.  All the computer generated effects cannot make this film, and most of the other modern technological \\"masterpieces\\" of the past decade, worth watching.  I feel as if I'm watching a video game with additional, irrelevant dialogue when I view movies these days.  The script, the acting, and yes, the special effects in this new 2010 \\"Clash\\" are ridiculous.  Ray Harryhausen was a genius and his classic films, though definitely dated, still hold up well as much as seventy years later. I don't think that anyone will say the same about \\"Clash 2010\\",the Transformer movies,or their ilk ten years from now. I agree that the original 1981 Harry Hamlin film was a bit cornball, but it is \\"Gone with the Wind\\" compaired to this state-of-the-art mess! If movie studios are to continue to re-make the studio big shot's childhood favorites, please resurrect stop-motion and write a decent script aside from the special effects, or a at least have a guy in a dinosaur suit next time.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|I often get live concert DVD's, as I can't get to the real thing. So many friends have seen Paul on his recent tours, that I felt like I was really missing something, and I was. There's only 2 performers that could be any better. Those would be: 1] Stevie wonder and 2] Led Zeppelin, in that order. Paul is right on their heals. It has to do w/ the performance being magical. Paul has that magic. I think too this was a sentimental show for him, reminding him of when he came to the US w/ The Beatles. Not as good to being there, but it was the next best thing. I got this item for the concert DVD only and not the CD's, but I will say the CD's have nice recordings of the same songs that are in the show w/ out the talk between the songs. So they are fun to listen to. It was money well spent just for the DVD alone and the CD's just made for a nice extra.    I was quite taken by Paul's magic onstage. No wonder The Beatles made it so big. He really hasn't lost a thing over the years. He still rocks! He sang many of the songs that we all know and love. \\"Live and Let Die\\" was outstanding, complete w/ a fireworks show. Billy Joel also came on as a special guest during one of the songs.    The camera shots and the sound was great. If there was one thing I didn't care for, and I have to stretch to find something, it would be the inserts of the original Beatles show. I felt that broke up the flow of the present show. There was not much of it so I didn't find it too distracting.     I would have to say it is a must for fans. For anyone who just remotely likes his music, they too will enjoy his stellar performance. This is one not to pass up.
B00005K3O0|3.0|This reminded me of million dollar baby, where the first and second halves of the movies were almost separate films.  The  first half of this one is a horror/thriller like several others of that era (exorcist).  The second half was like a documentary on reincarnation and hinduism.       Still, the film was definitely watchable and overall entertaining.  The acting by Hopkins and Mason was excellent.  Ending was a surprise, not what I would have guessed.

1401309666|3.0|The Long Tailed by Chris Anderson is an entertaining read to say the least.  It is also a very easy read.  Anderson talks about how there is a never ending marketplaces because niche markets will always exist. This \\"Unlimited Shelf Space\\" is revolutionizing the sales and retail industries.    Anderson provides great examples about how companies, especially Amazon, have adopted this philosophy.  Amazon is changing the way people make purchases.  In the past, going to a bookstore meant that there were a finite number of choices. Browsing online, having \\"You might also enjoy...\\" sections, and reading customer recommendations/reviews has made it possible to find old and new books that one would have never knew existed.      Wikipedia refers to the long tail as the statistical property that a larger share of population rests within the tail of a probability distribution than observed under a 'normal' or Gaussian distribution.  When applied to economics and the context of the marketplace it is easy to see how choices can be so limited prior to online media.  Anderson highlights the movie and television industry to make this point.  With so many movies and limited time and resources, movies that will become \\"hits\\" and attract the broadest audience will be given air time.  However, there are thousands of movie, shows, documentaries, etc that are in demand but are new viewed or given attention.  All of these products fall within the long tail. Anderson argues that all of these products included in the long tail outweigh the mainstream potential.  This is the main theme of his book and Anderson continuously provides interesting examples to illustrate this point.      While this was a very enjoyable read, there were several things that I disliked about the book.  I felt like there was a lot of repetition in the book.  The concept presented is very simple and I felt that Anderson was beating a dead horse at certain points.  Perhaps if he went more in-depth about certain industries then the book would have been more enjoyable.  Furthermore, after reading the book and then reading the Wired article, I felt that Anderson did not add much more expansion onto the concept.  It seems as though this book was drawn out version of the Wired article.     Despite some of the books shortcomings, the fact that this is an occurring phenomenon cannot be ignored.  There is so much potential for profit in the long tail of markets. If someone can tap into niche markets by using mainstream products as the attraction, then the profits and success is there for the taking. This is the final message that Anderson is looking to convey.        Overall this is a nice little read which will provoke some thought about a new topic occurring in economics today.  I recommend giving the book a read, but if you are pressed for time, then reading the Wired article could provide you with the same information at fraction of the time.
B001EOOQEM|5.0|Considering the fact that 1976's \\"Technical Ecstasy,\\" and `78's drug-crazed \\"Never Say Die!,\\" met with mixed reviews and commercial response, and did not come even close to living up with such classics \\"Paranoid\\" and \\"Masters of Reality\\" (among others), many fans began to doubt Black Sabbath. Yes, they are definitely one of the best heavy metal bands in history, and are also probably the most influential thing ever to happen to the genre, but these two albums exposed them as flawed and human. This rough patch was furthered when the band went on an emotionally draining \\"Never Say Die\\" tour, experimented heavily with drugs (and other substances), and even endured their first ever line-up change when frontman Ozzy Osbourne was shockingly fired in 1979. At the time, All of this inner-turmoil begged the question: \\"Has B.S. run its course?\\"<br /><br />Oh, no! Quite the opposite, in fact, because they simply refused to die. Instead, Sabbath retained credibility by putting the regrettable last couple of years behind them, recruiting a new singer/lyricist by the name of Ronnie James Dio (who possesses enormous talent despite being such a little guy - he stands at a mere five feet tall), and kicking out another new record soon thereafter. Naturally, Dio's debut, 1980's \\"Heaven and Hell\\" sounds somewhat experimental/different (when compared to most recordings with Ozzy Osbourne behind the mic.) For example, here, Black Sabbath dabble in and draw some influence from the hard rock, progressive, and power metal genres. Plus, an officially full-time keyboardist (Geoff Nicholls) is now on board for the first time. As a result, there are a few more melodic and psychedelic leanings than usual. Even so, \\"H&H\\" also marks a return to form because it is still plenty heavy, doomy, and crunchy guitar-oriented, and is arguably the most memorable, aggressive, cohesive, well-written, and consistently good effort we have heard from the Sabbs since the early Seventies. Suffice to say, these five, Birmingham, England-based metal musicians all sounded really hungry, tight, committed, revitalized, and ready to rock.<br /><br />\\"Neon Knights,\\" gets the ball rolling quickly. It is a strong opener with tasty riffs, deft leads, brief harmonic sections, and epic and infectious guitar soloing. (Make sure you pay special attention to the last solo, which is the sweetest one of all, clocking in at well over half a minute in length.) The impressive fret work is anchored by a good, grumbling bass bottom, and it is all topped off by Dio's soulful, Bruce Dickinson-like, power metal-derived vocals. \\"Children of the Sea\\" offers good contrast to its up-tempo predecessor because it is an ambient and laid-back power ballad complete with a pretty acoustic intro, only a few crunchy power chords, and tons of pensive, top-notch clean singing. Back on the heavier side, \\"Lady Evil\\" is a very catchy, sludgy, and bass-driven rocker featuring a monstrous bass intro and a memorable solo from axeman Tony Iommi that will have your fingers itching to play air guitar. The ensuing title song takes the cake for the album's highpoint. This is an epically epic, seven-minute-long piece highlighted by another potent performance from Dio (including irresistible vocal hooks and fist-pumping choruses), occasional solos (some of which are melodic, and some fiery and ripping), thumping drums, and inventive, galloping bass lines interwoven between an adherent, rhythmic, stop-start groove. And, of course, one must not forget to mention this: Some of Iommi's absolute best, and most punishing, sizeable, and unforgettable riffage of all-time. Sure, things get a little more gentle later on (there's even a gorgeous melodic string arrangement at the end). But, for the most part, this tune displays Black Sabbath's meanest and hardest-hitting side. And it is chock-full of one really killer, meaty, visceral, droning, lumbering, downtuned, and distinctly sludgy/doomy guitar lick after another.<br /><br />\\"Die Young\\" is another one of the best songs in the whole bunch. It has an epic scope - it has cool keyboards and harmonizing guitars in its fade-in intro before suddenly gaining ample momentum and becoming almost blisteringly fast. And despite opening up for a proggy mid-section that is strangely reminiscent of Queen, most of the rest of the tune retains surprisingly vicious tempos. In fact, \\"Die Young\\" actually verges on near-speed metal territory (thus making Judas Priest frequently come to mind). And make sure you check out its keyboard-abetted breakdown, a wailing guitar outro, and deep and meaningful lyrics, too. (Its subject revolves around consumerism and living a pointless/useless life.) And elsewhere, \\"Lonely Is The World,\\" with its its ominous overtones, plodding tempos, doomy rhythms, and dense, grinding, lurching riffs, is a somber set closer, and a possible precursor to stoner metal. It is also noteworthy because it finds Iommi lending undeniably bluesy flourishes to the mix when he uncorks another bunch of great, winding, and sometimes screaming solos.<br /><br />At the time (circa 1980), Black Sabbath knew that they had to not only bounce back, but bounce back sounding as strong as ever. In other words, they essentially had to take the world by storm. Well...they did! Of course, this would not have been possible without the release of \\"Heaven And Hell,\\" which is proof that, for the first time several years, the spark is finally back. You can hear it; and it is back almost tenfold. As a result, the members recapture all of their other musical magic of old. Granted, this album may not be the cream of Black Sabbath's crop (it doesn't top 1970's \\"Paranoid\\"). But it certainly does come close. And it definitely ranks in the top-five the all-around strongest and most memorable things ever to bear Sabbath's name. Plus, if nothing else, the fact remains that \\"Heaven And Hell\\" is at least a truly great and timeless heavy metal album; and one that marked a fantastic comeback from the band, thus making it a landmark effort, and a big standout in their discography.the best songs in the whole bunch.

0385341008|2.0|This book is the equivalent of \\"elevator music.\\" It's meant to lull, relax you until its saccharin insistence wants to make you run away. But no such luck! It's planted somewhere in your head, and no matter how you want to rid yourself of it, it stubbornly refuses to vacate your brain.<br /><br />I usually don't read this kind of fiction, \\"popular, \\" best-selling \\"literature,\\" but a friend gave it to me and I gave it a try. I should have known what to expect from a book endorsed by The Christian Science Monitor.  The characters are precious, loveable eccentrics, the stock personalities so identified with English stereotypes. Ostensibly, they are individuals living out their lives against the background of German occupied Guernsey, and the post-war year. Yet, even the hardship and war atrocities witnessed seem diluted in the presence of the inhabitants. They're all so charming, quirky and plucky; you're admittedly seduced into seeing their story through to the end.  All in all it's a naïve book, an adult fairy tale read to pass the time at the airport, the doctor's office or any other place you've got a long wait in store and have nothing better with which to occupy your time.
B00000J2SO|4.0|I have not yet received this album yet but it does not matter. why? I love almost everything Ritchie Blackmore does. This album was recorded after he lost Ronnie James Dio and gang, so different direction, which was on purpose. As Joe Lynn Turner stated recently (who is singer on later albums and now performs these songs in Europe with Ritchie's 47 yr old son--Jurgen) he was drafted in to get Ritchie on the radio and so they lost fans but stated they gained many more for everyone they lost. I really don't understand why some fans leave a band because of an album or two when the same great guitarist is central to the band's style and ability. Ritchie is a great musician, why can't people enjoy his music in its entirety? Does music become less beautiful in different genres? Perhaps not, but people are fickle.

Anyone interested in a copy of this film will find this to be THE copy to own.
1439153663|3.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It reminded me very much of the movie North and South with Patrick Swayze (except for the tremendous tragdies that took place in this book, it was very similiar).  I was not aware of the Irish as indentured servants so this was an interesting learning experience for me. This is a great first book from the author. I look forward to others from her, but would have liked to have had less tragedies, there were so many across the board in this book and very little positives. Slavery was a horrible thing but this was just too much at times.
B003LDKUSK|5.0|I have always loved this book......it's a story of family, resilience, and kindness.  I give it away any chance I can.  If you are visiting Boston, be sure to take a ride on the Swan Boat in the public garden.  You will see the latest generation of the \\"Mallard\\" Family.    Quack!
0061537969|5.0|A brilliant book for anyone with a little knowledge of motor racing and dogs  A special relationship between a dog and his owner brilliantly related from the dogs perspective.  Interwoven with the roller coaster relationship between a man and woman.  Makes you laugh, cry and ponder things philosophical.  I loved this book and rate it one of the best books I have read - ever.  Elina
0618680004|5.0|Wish I'd have had this book to read 10 years ago.  Becoming non-religious is a daunting experience.  I was going so-o-o against the grain of what I'd been taught and also what everyone around me believed with great conviction.  I needed support and validation for what I was feeling and going through, when I realized that I didn't believe in God.  I will recommend this book and others when I encounter someone who is \\"teetering\\".

B00001W9G0|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie in over 30 years.  I was thrilled to finally get it on DVD.  Barbra and Robert Redford were so great together.  Robert Redford is so good looking in this romantic film. I can't stop watching this film.  It is my all time favorite. The music could not have been better. It adds to the feel of this outstanding film.  I have never watched a movie so many times as I have watched \\"The Way We Were\\" I always admired Marvin Hamlisch's work. Barbara Streisand and Robert Redford should make a sequel
1439102724|3.0|It seems that Jodi Picoult books are hit or miss with me.  There are some that I love (Nineteen Minutes is my favorite) and some that I don't love as much (House Rules) and some that have infuriated me (Handle With Care) but no matter what my final thoughts on the books I have never been bored.  This novel falls in between loving and being meh on it.  What I loved most about this novel was the subject matter and I really liked Zoe's character.  Of course, along with the other readers, the ending irked me a bit - not because of HOW it ended but on how quickly it was ended.  I really feel like there could almost be another chapter to somewhat fill in the blanks and give a bit more of a rounded ending to it.<br /><br />Regardless of the ending, this book swept me up and I was up most of a night finishing it because I couldn't put it down.  I do recommend this novel to the Picoult fans out there :)<br /><br />Note: I did NOT listen to the music that went along with the book.
B00005A0V0|5.0|Much about the background/history of this album has already been discussed at great length in other reviews. What I will say is that the original vinyl was a quality production but has been reinvigorated with this outstanding remastering, boosted with worthy bonus tracks + excellent liner notes = 5-stars. Although some songs are very English centric and and consequently are dated, the album contains some of the finest instrumental pieces and musicianship of its era, in particular the Canterbury Scene.
B0036XN2L2|5.0|I recently bought this CD, and I have to admit I was a little skeptical at first. After playing several times, I realized that it sounded like the Scorpions went back in time to the 80's to make this CD. If you like 80's rock, and you like old style Scorpions, then this is the CD for you. I think it's one of their best since the 1988 release of \\"Savage Amusement\\".
1595141715|4.0|As I sit to write a review on Thirteen Reason's Why I'm honestly not that sure on what to say about it.  I really don't know how I feel.    I will start off first by saying that this is a book that will be sticking with me, for a very long time I'm sure.  With the book being about a girl who commits suicide and leaving these tapes telling why, how could it not?  The format of the book is chilling and after listening to the short clips on the website, the effect was even more so.  I felt like I could feel everything Clay was feeling as he listened to Hannah tell about her slow spiral down.    The biggest thing I don't know what to think of though is Hannah herself.  She recounts all the terrible things that have happened to her since her freshman year of high school, all the boys who thought she was someone she wasn't because of what someone said about her, or because of a hot or not list she landed on because of a joke.  I'm just going to say it, rip the Band-Aid off though: My problem with this book was that I didn't like Hannah herself.  I feel terrible saying this about a character who kills herself in the end but I just couldn't connect with her and I had a hard time feeling that everything that happened to her was terrible enough to warrant ending her life.      Alright, take a deep breath all.  *In and out*    That being said, this book hits hard on emotional levels.  It makes you really, really think about the way you've treated people and what you've said about them in the past.  As the book says: everything affects everything.  I know that I will watch everything I say and think about people.  You never know how it is going to affect them and you never know what they're going through.    I'm honestly not sure how to rate this book.  Based on what it made me feel though I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars.
1439102813|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Although it was very sad to read, I believe it is a realistic depiction. It provided much discussion at our monthly book club meeting.
0307474712|5.0|I love, love, love this book!  I loved it so much that when I finished it, I turned right back to the first page and read it through a second time.<br /><br />The characters are both deeply flawed, but so very real.  I've read where other readers have absolutely hated them for being whiny and squandering the best, most productive years of their lives.  That may be so, but isn't that true of most of us?  I can see how that argument would be valid for those who have their lives completely mapped out at age 22, but I honestly don't think that applies to most of the population.  People flounder about, just like Dexter and Emma.  In a way, I suppose it validates my own sense of - I don't know, not exactly failure; that's much too strong a word, but something akin to it  - in taking too long to do anything significant with my life.  I almost feel like I could have been Emma, the way she just sat around waiting for life to happen to her, wondering if maybe her lack of assertiveness had cost her any chance of anything with Dexter.  Yes, Dexter is an ass throughout most of the book, but seeing him through Emma's eyes, you just know that he can be so much more and you can't help feeling Emma's heartache and anxiety as she watches him and tries to stand by him through the years, hoping he'll finally mature and live up to the potential she just knows he has.<br /><br />Reading Mr. Nicholls leaves me feeling hopeful that no matter how many obstacles life throws your way (or as with Dexter, how many you place in your own path) there is always a chance for redemption.<br /><br />I know Mr. Nicholls does other kinds of writing in addition to novels, but I almost wish he would give that up and just focus on novels; I enjoy his writing that much.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|I was just recently introduced to Modern Family and I love it. It's the talk around work every Thursday morning. Tune in a few times... get to know the characters and enjoy!!  With all the drama on TV it is wonderful to watch a half hour sitcom and end the day with a laugh!
B000TX7B5U|3.0|Not too much different than his leadership style of System of a Down is how the performance was displayed on Serj Tankian's solo album, \\"Elect the Dead.\\" Still sounds weird at times, still has those unexpected stops \\"in the middle of the road,\\" or sudden stops in rhythms or melodies, and still has extraodinary usage of his production abilities, at least that's how it was with his former band's music in general. And of course still political are aspects of lyrics within.<br /><br />Songs still include complaining, satire and deep meaning.<br /><br />\\"Empty Walls\\" reveals the significance about lack of attention excessive coffins that were being used around the time this album came out (Fall 2007). \\"The Unthinking Majority\\" fights for democracy. \\"Money\\" emphasizes conservative spending/saving. \\"Feed Us\\" revolves around sophisticated lying and abortion. \\"Sky is Over\\" questions our dependence on animals and unveils negative economy. \\"Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition:\\" that title alone makes this catchy song stick out, and is, to me, the most interesting song on \\"Elect the Dead.\\"<br /><br />\\"Honking Antelope\\" embraces a hard truth: we're the cause of our problems, basically, so save the moment in a picture; an okay song. The title track is an okay song too. It's both selfish and selfless.<br /><br />I didn't like the problematic love songs \\"Baby\\" and \\"Lie Lie Lie,\\" and  \\"Beethoven's C***\\" expresses low power in self.

0143038419|4.0|Eat Pray Love is not a classic, earth-shattering book, and it shouldn't be expected to be. That's where other people's disappointment comes from. It does however have its place.    Though I couldn't relate to Gilbert's divorce, I could totally relate to her emotional tribulations.I find it interesting that some people say that she should just get over herself. But don't we all broode in our regrets about things that happened years ago? I can also relate to some processes that she used to cleanse herself.     Then, it was interesting how she included a lot of historical and cultural information - which was quite educational and interesting (That's how they should write history books for kids who don't want to learn history, you end up learning by accident : )    Finally, there was a touch of magic in the book, that is - real magic. I've seen it happen in my life, and it's nice to know that it happens in other people's lives.     Overall, it's a good read, as long as you don't expect a literal masterpiece : )
B001L83PLQ|5.0|Chimamanda does a great job of describing the Biafran wars in a way that exposes one to a part of history not normally discussed. She uses vivid imagery that places you in the cross fire without losing a hair on your head. Great work!

045122499X|5.0|I was entralled with Ken Follett's \\"Pillars of the Earth,\\" and am just as enthralled with this sequel.  It's a couple of hundred years later, still in the Middle Ages, and he paints a vivid picture of every day life for common people and the clergy.  Fascinating reading as the lives of the characters intertwine to make it difficult to put down.
1594202842|5.0|I heard about this book on a recent trip to Hong Kong.  This book was very universal in its approach to parenting. Amy Chua is very honest and in depth with her writing.  There are moments in the book that are very dark and maybe even overexposing of the fragility of the family dynamic, however it is very human.  I really enjoyed this book, and I have no kids.
B002ZG99N6|4.0|Non-stop full on action with a twist. Great acting, good plot, and full on entertainment. This movie made my surround system 'dance'. As a true Ben Affleck fan I was not let down.
B0000074FL|5.0|Renegade is a very musically diverse album from the borderline metal Angel Of Death with it's eerie keyboard intro solo, to the jazzy track Fats. Some Thin Lizzy classics to come from this album in my opinion include Angel Of Death, Renegade, The Pressure Will Blow, and Hollywood. Those tracks alone should have been enough to gather at least a 3 star review from the \\"professional critics\\". If you read the review on AllMusisGuide, you will see a \\"critic\\" stating how the title track fails to \\"tug on the heart strings\\". That struck me as rather odd, as Renegade was as heavy as Lizzy could get before Thunder and Lightning. If any track on this album is meant to tug on the heart strings, it's It's Getting Dangerous. Here's some lyrics from the song.<br /><br />\\"I remember him when we were friends, when we were young, way back then<br />But now we're all grown up and we're strangers<br />You see, bit by bit, part by part, we slipped and slipped<br />Till we'd grown apart and now we're strangers.\\"<br /><br />This was the second Thin Lizzy album I've ever listened to in full, and loved it. Fats and Mexican Blood are the only real detours if you're looking for straight up hard rock. Fats as I said above, is a jazzy track, with a great flow that is  Would have been great on one of Phils solo albums as well as Mexican Blood, a more Spanish sounding ballad then Mexican, but I really don't care as I enjoy the song. Brian Downey, one of rocks most underrated drummers is as solid as ever, and truly shines on Angel of Death and the title track. Give Renegade a few listens and and judge for yourself. Don't listen to critics.  Who cares if it's not the classic \\"Thin Lizzy sound\\", it's still a great album. 5/5 from me.<br /><br />If you get this on CD, DO NOT GET THE WOUNDED BIRD REISSUE. Some of the worst crap I've heard in my life.
B004EJUMT2|5.0|WHEN I FIRST HEARD THIS, I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ANOTHER DOOM ALBUM. THEN I LISTENED TO THE HOLE THING. TWO WORDS DESCRIBE IT \\"EVIL\\" & \\"HAPPY\\". IT WAS NOT A DOOM BAND, BUT SOMETHING DIFFERENT ENTIRELY.<br />EVERY SONG IS A HAIL TO SATAN, YET IT SOUNDS SO POPPY AND HAPPY. I IS LIKE NOTHING I HAVE EVER HEARD BEFORE. SOOTHING CLEAR VOKILLS, AND THE MUSICK IS LIKE SOMETHING YOU WOULD HERE DURING THE CREDITS OV A 1970'S SATANIC EXPLOITATION FILM. SO BUY THIS NOW AND HAIL SATAN WITH THE MOST EVIL BAND EVER.
0061537969|4.0|This book may not be the most sophisticated piece of literature that I have ever read, and it may have been even a little too cheesy at times, but The Art of Racing in the Rain by Garth Stein was exactly what I was looking for. Before I get any deeper into my review, I really can't see anyone who doesn't like dogs enjoying this book. I found myself laughing at certain parts, such as when Enzo, the dog, talked about watching television or purposely pooping on the floor to get back at people he didn't like. In order to be able to handle a dog being personified this much, one would have to understand and be able to appreciate the four legged friend. I picked up this book as looking for something light over the vacation and although it did satisfy that, I was surprised by how involved I ended up getting with this quick read.  A good way of describing the book is that it is like Marley and Me  but from the perspective of the dog. This dog would go through phases of saying simple things that we would expect a dog to say such as, \\"Oh the joy! Denny and me and our BMW, driving all day and into the evening like a couple of banditos running from the law, like partners in crime. It had to be a crime to lead such a life as we led...\\" (p. 149). Then Enzo would say things that were very deep such as \\"Given a facile tongue, I could have warned them. I could have alerted them to her condition long before they discovered it with their machines, their computers and super-vision scopes that can see inside the human head. They may think those machines are sophisticated, but in fact they are clunky and clumsy, totally reactive, based on a philosophy of symptom-driven medicine that is always a step late. My nose--yes, my little black nose that is leathery and cute--could smell the disease in Eve's brain long before even she knew it was there. But I hadn't a facile tongue. So all I could do was watch and feel empty inside.\\" (p. 37). These were my favorite moments, where I would laugh and hope that this could possibly be true. I would enjoy it if dogs were actually just as smart as all of us and the only thing stopping them was their tongues and lack of thumbs. This book did a lot to plant that idea in my head.  Enzo seems to be the anchor of the family as he watches Denny struggle to keep his family and life together. He happens to be the one that saves Denny from a potentially terrible situation that almost ruins everything. The best part of Enzo's character in my opinion was how effectively it captured the thought-process of a dog. Enzo jumps back and forth so easily from carefree fun thoughts and worrisome thoughts about his family and about life in general. I can just picture my dog sleeping in the sun at one point and then running over to see if everyone in the family is okay. It is nice to see the opinion of humans from the unbiased viewpoint of a dog. Dogs can only see in black and white and Enzo brings this to his ideas of the people that he interacts with. Denny is genuine and hard-working so Enzo appreciates him. Enzo knows that Eve doesn't originally take to him but that she later accepts and values his presence because of what he means to Denny. This makes her okay in his book. Annika and The Twins are people that Enzo immediately doesn't like and he turns out to be right in how they affect the household. Enzo boils everyone down to their true intentions and this is a refreshing way of looking at people.  I think that refreshing is a good word to describe this book, I needed a new voice to hear and this worked. Enzo was the perfect blend of being somewhat realistic while still bringing something new to the table that I hadn't read before. Other than the last chapter which was a little too much, I thought that this book did little wrong and would recommend it to anyone I see walking their dog in the nearby park.

0553805371|1.0|Where to begin with this very problematic book.  Hawking and Mlodinow start off by disparaging philosophy then engage in philosophy themselves. But it's nothing but amateur night and so full of self-contradictions. Professionals in the respective fields like Roger Penrose in physics/ cosmology and professional philosophers and philosophers of science are basically saying that this book is an embarrassment. William Lane Craig said in a review of this book:     \\"The professional philosopher will regard their verdict as not merely amazingly condescending but also as outrageously naïve. The man who claims to have no need of philosophy is the one most apt to be fooled by it. One might therefore anticipate that Mlodinow and Hawking's subsequent exposition of their favored theories will be underpinned by a host of unexamined philosophical presuppositions.\\"      The public probably assumes that if it's written by Hawking then it must be good.   It's not.    Some of the authors ideas are:    - Reality is mind dependent.  - The universe creates itself.  - The universe does have a beginning even in the Hawking-Hartle cosmology.     These are cobbled together in incoherent ways.    Never the less, there are very interesting expositions in the book so it's not a total loss but given the rest, I only gave it one star.    Finally, this book promotes the most ridiculous idea a person could ever have.   The idea is about origin and that is:    SOMETHING COMES FROM NOTHING.    That's it folks!   That is what Hawking claims he has shown, which of course he has not.    No where in metaphysics or science does anyone use this as a causal reason/explanation since it's irrational and ultimately stops further investigation and progress. Silly as it seems, one may accept the logical contradiction that the \\"laws of physics\\" show that the \\"laws of physics\\" came from nothing. But the price paid is that you stop thinking.    One then wonders what is the motivation for essentially jumping off the intellectual cliff.   Is it just the protection of an ideology?    Materialist/physicalist have a problem with an origin of time in the universe/multiverse.   An infinite past does not work for either logical or physical reasons.   A finite past then requires a start of time but that requires a timeless cause.   Potential categories of causes are essentially three:     1. Physical  2. Abstract objects  3. Minds     Physical processes are temporal by definition, abstract objects like mathematical entities don't have causal powers, so only minds are left.     But Hawking isn't a materialist, he's a radical anti-realist of a post-modern type!  Nothing is truer or more real than anything else. It's just a matter of pragmatics. One belief maybe a better tool at prediction than another but neither is truer or more real. In philosophy, professional philosophers do not go to those extremes, they are not anti-realists about everything and for good reasons. But that does stop these two amateurs.    As I mentioned before, Hawking is also a radical relativist.  Our minds create reality.     Hawking is trying to avoid both materialism/physicalism or the conclusion that a mind (God) created the universe.    This is really an atheist's strategy not to \\"face the music.\\"   It's a case of denial brought on by an existential crisis that I suspect has haunted Hawking most of his life.

B004C4IKCU|5.0|This album was all I expected and more. I already listened to it twice. My only previous reference to this album were the songs \\"Such A Night\\" and \\"Reconsider Baby\\", both outstanding songs on their own. The album as a whole doesn't disappoint. All tracks could have been hit singles, but the norm of the time were to keep single separate from the albums. A few blues songs here and there well done. Originally released in April 1960, surprisingly reaching #2 on Billboard charts.    The Legacy Edition is a 50th Anniversary edition,(one year late, anyway), that includes all the hit singles he released around the time this album was released.  Also, this edition includes the album Something for Everybody which, for my surprise, was better than expected. This album (SFE) hasn't been very popular over the years, so my expectations were low, but it turned out to be very enjoyable. Don't know what the bad rep is all about. It includes new liner notes and pictures. I highly recommended this album to the serious and casual fan out there. Enjoy.
B0036TGSIK|4.0|Saw this movie in the theaters and enjoyed it. My girlfriend loved it so I bought it for her for Valentine's and she was really excited.
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|I don't understand why this album only has an average rating of 3 1/2 stars.  I LOVE this album!  It is the catchiest, most fun album I have listened to in a long time.  IMO Nicki isn't lying when she says \\"the whole album crack, you ain't gotta skip a track.\\"  I can't stop listening to it.  I'm not a huge rap fan, but I do enjoy the greats such as Tupac, Eminem, Dre, and Snoop.  I think Nicki is right up there with the greats.  Sure, the songs may not be just straight up rap and include singing as well, but if you are like me and enjoy several genres of music and not just one, you will love this.  The songs are infectious and melodic and will literally stay in your head for days, but that isn't a bad thing.  It will just make you want to listen to the album again.  At first, I thought Nicki was just a Lady Gaga wannabe with the wigs and all, but once I heard her music, I realized she isn't anything like Gaga and I was hooked.  I also admire Nicki for making an album that isn't just non stop lyrics about sex and being a whore like Lil Kim.  All and all, I would say if you enjoy her singles, definitely pick up the album.  I can't see why you would be disappointed.
0765350386|5.0|I ordered this book for my Kindle on a lark since I saw the Sanderson's name mentioned in an AMA by Ken Jennings. I ordered it 4 days ago, and have since finished the trilogy. Every page was wonderful and drew me into a world of Allomancy and the extraordinary powers of Mistborns. I spend my afternoons and evenings inhabiting Sanderson's world of the Final Empire wishing I could spend a year studying abroad there. If you enjoy this book, I'd suggest picking up Winter of Fire by Sherryl Jordan as it has a similar plot of an oppressed people in a post-apocalyptic world and their struggle to gain freedom through a strong heroine.

0670022411|5.0|This story is the romance between a brilliant, ancient, volatile and sexy vampire named Matthew Clairmont, and a beautiful, educated historian and witch named Diana Bishop who, in spite of being feisty, is not at all in touch with her own powers. It's tightly written with something interesting on every page, and is not typical or predictable, as are so many books in this genre. In fact, it escapes pigeon-holing entirely, and could be the start of something new: romance, history, science and magic for smart readers who enjoy substance over corset-busting fluff, and who have a fierce need for good writing in the same way Matthew Clairmont needs blood. Great pacing, good tension, funny, provocative, and even when the story turns sentimental, it has enough REAL romantic energy to save it from becoming too precious. I haven't enjoyed a good read like this in a long time, but I'm always searching, and in Deborah Harkness I have found an author whose work I can look forward to. I happened across it accidentally while mindlessly trolling through amazon's unfathomable stacks, and now I know what A Discovery of Witches I have made indeed. Bravo for this work of perfection, and please bring on the next part of the story!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|The high end headphones market is vast and strange. The Sony Professional mdr-7506's are a beam of light in a cloudy mess. These headphones have great audio quality and have enough versatility to be used on a daily basis.<br /><br />The build quality is notably good. The cans have aluminum cases which makes them durable enough to be tossed and thrown in with everything else in your bag. The hinges are well thought out and designed to take a beating.

I was recommended these by a friend and I purchased them without wearing them. That could have been a grave mistake but boy was it not. These things are like wearing magic pillows of sound.

I have purchased headphones that cost twice as much and I could not wear them for more than 15 minutes.<br /><br />The sound quality is great, though not perfect. Sound quality is the most important characteristic of a set of headphones. These are fantastic in providing bass while still having clear mids and highs.

Although they are not open ear phones (let a lot of ambient noise through), they are also not noise canceling/isolating headphones. This can be a good or a bad thing depending on the environment of use. They are perfect if you have low ambient noises. If you are looking for a set of headphones for use on an airplane or in other loud places, look somewhere else. They definitely lower the roar but do not cut it out.<br /><br />For the price point, these headphones are top notch and I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a great set of headphones that are built to last.r the price point, these headphones are top notch and I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a great set of headphones that are built to last.

This young lady deserves those awards for sure.  I don't buy whole albums anymore, but I will for Adele.  Someone please teach our children what \\"real\\" music is....i.e. Adele!!!!  Great CD...best I have listened to by far in years.  I wish she would collaborate with some other singers as well.....get some duets going!!!  I think I have listened to \\"Someone Like You\\" from her 2011 British Awards performance on YouTube close to 30 times.....I wish the album version were like that performance!  You won't be disappointed!
1439102724|2.0|If you're interested in reading something by Jodi Picoult, don't start here. Start with My Sister's Keeper. The last three books seem to have started a downhill slide, ending with this one sitting at the bottom of a hill in a heap. I won't rehash the story as I hate spoilers and Amazon's description covers it well. Suffice to say that the characters were quite two-dimensional, and I found myself not really caring about any of them by the time the trial rolled around.<br /><br />I listened to the audiobook which came with music. The lyrics were written by Jodi Picoult. For what a great writer she used to be, she needs to stick to writing and definitely not lyrics. I found myself embarrassed for her at how cheesy and campy the lyrics were. The songs sounded like something that fell out of the late sixties (not in a good way) and made me want to braid my hair with daisies and stare at the sun too long.<br /><br />After her book \\"Change of Heart\\", I just began waiting for her new releases to become available from the library. I'm glad I didn't pay $14.99 for this Kindle edition -- this is one you wait for a friend to loan you, or just go get from the library if you're mildly interested and have nothing else to read.<br /><br />I have read every Jodi Picoult book published. I'll probably read the next one. But I won't be buying it.
142311339X|5.0|SPOILER ALERT  The Lost Hero by Rick Riordan is a very exciting book because it has a lot of action and you understand each of the characters' backgrounds. I think it deserves five out of five stars because Riordan writes it in such a way that you care about all the good guys, especially Jason, Piper, and Leo. They are the three main characters and they are demigods. Jason, Piper, and Leo all go to a boarding school in Arizona called the Wilderness School. While on a field trip at the Grand Canyon they are attacked by a storm spirit.  Their gym coach, Coach Hedge, who is a satyr, and Jason, together stop the storm spirit, but Coach Hedge is captured. Jason, Piper, and Leo are safe though. The three teens are then recruited to Camp Half-Blood, where they find out who their godly parents are. The main plot is the quest that Jason, Piper, and Leo take to free Hera, the goddess of marriage. Some interesting and important parts are when they free Hera at The Wolf House, and when they free Piper's dad at Mount Diablo.   This is the best book I've ever read because you want Jason, Piper, and Leo to succeed on their quest and not die. There is also a lot of adventure, and Rick Riordan explains all three teens' pasts. I love how, at first you don't know what's going on, then as the book continues the action picks up and the story picks up. You also find out who is keeping Hera hostage and who is keeping Piper's dad hostage. I think Riordan made an excellent choice starting the book out with a bang. I'm somewhat wanting to read it again. I learned a little more Greek mythology from it; the story of Zeus and Lycaon, how Aphrodite was born, and the Giants. I found it to be suspenseful, somewhat funny, definitely sad, and incredibly interesting along with action packed. My favorite part is when they fight six ogres and Enceladus, the giant, on Mount Diablo. This is when Piper frees her dad. I cannot think of a way to improve the book. The intended audience, or people who might enjoy this book are teens, probably fifteen or sixteen, and younger down to kids ten or eleven. This book is definitely similar to the Percy Jackson and the Olympians books one through five which were also written by Rick Riordan. The Lost Hero is just book one of probably another five book series called The Heroes of Olympus. This book is fantastic and Riordan gives his audience something to like and want to read again. I like how ideas that the ancient Greeks thought were important more than 2,000 years ago, are now being put into the 21st century. This shows Rick Riordan's creativity.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I have seen more versions of Les Mis than I can count.  This was one of the best.  The performances were moving, powerful -- just incredible.  My favorite was Samantha Barks as Eponine.  Not since Frances Ruffelle had I loved an actress' portrayal of Eponine so much.  Banks' voice, emotions, expressions -- all of it was absolute perfection.  I also thoroughly enjoyed Lea Salonga as Fantine, a role much better suited to her than that of Eponine.  Alfie Boe made a great Jean Valjean -- very emotive.  As for Nick Jonas -- yeah, he wasn't the best Marius I've ever seen.  But he did a decent job, and it gave me more respect for him as an artist.  He's been singing pop songs for too long; maybe if he stays on Broadway for awhile he can get up there with the greats.  I would have liked him to deck the Thenardiers, though.  I saw Marius do that at one show, at the wedding, and looooved it.  In sum, if you love Les Mis, you'll enjoy this performance quite a bit.
157421327X|1.0|This was a total rip-off. Very few pages with a few of the authors own little tangles. Nothing informative or unique. Can't even say there were any instructions. Zentangle basics says it all... BASICALLY it was 15 pages of her zentangles and you get to look at them for $9.00

030746363X|5.0|I guess the measure of the quality of the advice in a book is whether or not it works for you, and for me, this has been working well. To be sure, Ferriss intends to shake up your typical notions about diet and exercise, and there are things suggested in the book, like kettle-bell swings, that I just couldn't picture myself doing.<br /><br />But the way-of-eating advice and the basic fat-burning exercises have helped improve my own weight and body composition, and given that the price of the book is what you might pay for half an hour with a personal trainer, it's well worth it.
B004HV54TU|5.0|This Vertical-Mouse is wonderful if you have carpal tunnel!  They are always recommending the roller-ball mice for carpal tunnel, but I can't stand them. It was getting to the point that even a wrist-brace wasn't working. Now after using this mouse for about a month, most of the pain is gone, and I no longer have to use a wrist-brace at work.  The price of this mouse is high, but it's a lot less then surgery! I wish I had found this sooner.
B003L20ID8|3.0|This was a very average film. The premise was interesting, but nothing was really done with it. It had the potential to be something like \\"Dark City\\" but it wasn't. What I really can't figure out is how this film could possibly have had a budget of 50 million dollars. That seems like a whole lot for so little.     Matt Daemon uses the film to play around with his fantasies of being a politican and to preach. And according to the old formula, that requires that he be the good working-class kid from the old neighborhood in Brooklyn who suddenly rises to the top of New York politics. But no matter how many times he tries and how bad he wants it, Daemon can't come across as working class. His entire family is conveiently dead at the start of the film which further reduces him to something like a cipher. He seems to be either fantastically rich in the film or a sponge supported by his childhood friend become venture capitalist. But thats all noble because they talk about investing money in alternative energy. Alternative energy investment has become the magic water in popular culture that washes away all moral problems from characters that would otherwise be seen as greedy wall street hustlers.     Daemon's political delusions run all the way up to being president. He is such a great guy that god himself has picked him to inevitably lead the country in the film. Daemon's egotism run amok weighs really heavy against the film. Its difficult to find any redeeming features in the character he plays.     The heart of the film is basically a frustrated love story. He meets a dancer and its love at first sight. But they can't be together because of the effect it would have on their careers. The unintentional unexplored irony in the story is that either of them could have had love if one or the other had been willing to sacrifice their career ambitions for love. But egos being what they are, sacrifice is an alien concept. They want it all and if they have to resort to a childishtantrum to get it all, so be it. In the end, Daemon is willing to storm the gates of heaven for love but he isn't willing to give up being President to do it. Its a weakness in the film's plot and a rather nasty comment on modern culture.    To work, the love story in the film has to work. But it doesn't. Its all really shallow like both of their characters.     The film is also supposed to be a study of free will in life. But the film lacks any subtilty in the examining that. Every manipulation is blindingly obvious to both the characters and to the viewer. There are no real surprises to speak of with it. Nothing clever done with it.     For costing 50 million dollars, this was a remarkably simple film. There appeared to be no sets to speak of. I think there was all of two effects in the film. And the speaking cast was remarkably small. John Slattery does a good job with his part. Terence Stamp delivers whats expected of him.     If your looking for two hours of entertainment, its better than most. But there is nothing special or great about it.
0385341008|4.0|I read \\"Ella Minnow Pea,\\" which was a delightful novel written in letters.  I wanted to try another book in the same style so someone recommended this book.  I picked up this book and thought it would be as zany as \\"Ella Minnow Pea\\" (I mean, look at title!)<br />The novel surprised me!  It certainly had its fun parts, but it dealt with some very serious subjects.  I never learned about the occupation of the Channel Islands, or the tragic family history of Charles Lamb, or that Victor Hugo was at Guernsey.  This novel propelled me to do more research on these topics.<br />The book took a little while to pick up in the beginning and at the end, I thought it started to drag a bit since it became somewhat predictable.  Overall, still highly recommended!
1439102724|5.0|I am an avid Jodi reader but must admit I was a little nervous when I found out she was writing a book about such a controversial subject, the Gay community.  I came from an extremely conservative family and grew up being `anti-gay'.  The past few years I have become more neutral on the subject, not being passionate one way or the other about the subject.  I just finished Sing You Home and I have a completely new perspective on the LGBT community.  I never realized all of the battles they encounter and never realized the extreme measures people have taken to hold this community back from basic civil liberties. This book has made me realize the reality and prejudice that is occurring everyday in the world around me.  Who would have thought that a fictional book could have such a dramatic impact on my outlook on life and humanity?  Thank you Jodi for writing such an accurate and honest portrayal of the unfortunate injustice engrained in our society.
0312600844|4.0|I really liked this book.  Well-written, and kind of a page-turner!  I felt like I was always coming upon really good sentences, and to me, that's the greatest compliment I can give to a writer.  In general, I was pretty happy with the characters.  Walter was the only one who I didn't really believe -- is there really anyone who's that unselfconsciously earnest? -- but the rest of them were really good.      As for the \\"deeper message\\" of the book : I took something from it that it appears few others have.  The title is ironic.  Yes, it's about freedom.  Everyone in the book talks about freedom, freedom freedom freedom.  As Americans, we're obsessed with freedom.  But if you look at the characters in this book, they're all so totally isolated; it's the one thing they have in common.  Even the suburbanites of Ramsey Hill -- the nearest representation we get of community -- are isolated in their claustrophobic suburban microcosm.  And I think that's the main point of the book : as Americans, we have all of this freedom, but what we're really driven by is isolation.
0312600844|1.0|Wow!  This author appears to write from the fantasies of a male perspective and seems to have no idea of how to make his main female character believable.  My book group read this and we piled the books into a brown bag and voted on whether to use them for kindling or donate them to our library second hand book store and let others become depressed reading about characters with little or no hope of becoming balanced human beings.

1439102724|3.0|***This is my first review and it may contain spoilers***    I have read EVERY book by Jodi Picoult. She is my favorite author and her books usually affect me like no other. That being said this was definitely not her best.    She didn't develop the characters or their relationships nearly enough. It felt like there was a good 100+ pages missing from this book.     She also painted the husband's side very one side-ly. I was in agreement with the wife's side and I still felt like the husband's side was completely inhuman/unlikeable.     Also, she introduced you to a character \\"Lucy\\" and made you feel for her and want to know what happens to her then...you never find out! There is a conflict and you really never see it resolved or even know what truly happened. It was quite strange.    Lastly, the ending is thrown together in about 5-10 pages. It thoroughly needs to be flushed out with much more description /development. I couldn't believe that was it, it was over.    It was an OK story, but for a Jodi Picoult book, it was a great disappointment. I will say that her next sounds AWESOME and I of course will be reading it.
B003K1EYM6|1.0|Went to the Apple i-Sore (sorry, i-Store) in NYC today to buy an iPad2.  I have only one need: I'm a portrait photographer who takes lots of photos at a client sitting with a Nikon D300, which takes only CF compact flash memory cards.  Well, they didn't have ANY ipad2 in stock and even worse none on the floor to demo (can you believe it!), just 2 weeks after ipad2 was released.  The salesman there was very helpful and offered to let us see the older model, but said he had no idea how the \\"2\\" might differ from the old one.      I had brought a CF card with lots of photos on it to try the interface, along with a multi-card USB reader.  He said that the \\"camera kit\\" would \\"probably\\" work, but he didn't have any that he could use to demo it:  instead, I could BUY one for [...] and then return it if it didn't work.  And it works ONLY with SD cards not with CF cards, so I would have to hope that my USB CF card reader would work with it.    So I bought the [...] adapter and plugged it into the obsolete iPad, then plugged my card and reader into the adapter's USB port.  You gotta love the iPad graphics:  a really beautiful screen came up and told me that there wasn't enough power on the iPad to work the USB reader.  I guess I could spend a couple thousand dollars to buy the newer Nikon SLR, or I could go back to the i-Sore with my bulky camera and see whether the camera-to-USB cable works with the obsolete iPad and, if it does, hope that it still does with the iPad2.  But, as another reviewer noted on this site, there's no guarantee that Apple won't again change the OS software to block that capability the same way that they blocked the powered-USB feature last year.    So there's the usual Apple dead end, just like the iPhone4 that doesn't work as a telephone (but really great to take pictures of your friends while they're talking on their real non-Apple cellphones).    Like so much in the world of Apple, you just have to take it on faith that they're delivering value formoney, that they're as good as they say.  Why do people continue to put up with this?  I guess it's just this:  Apple makes fun things; just don't try to do any useful work with their products.

Have the sound right for speech then once the music overlay starts it becomes unbearable and the sound needs to be turned down and when the speech comes back on it needs turned up again so you are continuing juggling with the volume.
0670022411|1.0|Save your money and your time. Although it's peppered with archaic $10 words, to describe it as sophomoric would be undeserved flattery.<br /><br />One review made reference to this book as a \\"Twilight for the tweedy\\". Stephanie Meyer's young adult novels run laps 'round this unfortunate tome.<br /><br />The plot is disjointed and gawky; bumping along in literary prepubescent tumult.<br /><br />Like a too-far-gone drunken liaison, this novel is boring and unsatisfying in the worst way.

B0028RXXE8|5.0|This was one of the better re-creations of ancient Rome and I believe it was filmed in Italy which is always a nice touch.  Sadly, they only made two seasons.  The attention to detail such as the multi-cultural makeup of the street scenes and the accent difference between the patricians and the plebeians are what really set this series apart.  For any fan of ancient Rome, this is a must see series.
B004H99QQ4|5.0|The seven kingdoms, united under one ruler, have lived a life of peace and comfort since King Robert took the throne. But nothing is ever as it seems. Within the king's court there is murder and treason, with no one aware of what is really going on. Across the seas, the last remnants of the previous royal family gather forces to reclaim their throne. To the north, the unthinkable gathers, the creatures of myth and legend that have been forgotten.<br /><br />The first book in the series centers around the Stark family, the lords of the northernmost part of the kingdom, and the last Targaryens. The Starks, close friends of King Robert, are quickly drawn into the turmoil at court without realizing it. The Stark children are fascinating. I find it difficult to pick a favorite of the four (five if you count Lord Stark's bastard).<br /><br />The last of the Targaryens plot revenge and invasion from across the seas to reclaim their throne. Daenarys Targaryen is one of my absolute favorite characters of all time. The Princess is soft and delicate, yet hard and proud when the situation calls for it.<br /><br />I find it very difficult to describe the story without giving too much away about the characters and the plot. I admire Martin's honest writing. He does not flinch from including practices that were very common in real life medieval kingdoms: murder, execution, brothels, arranged marriages, and abuse. The way he weaves it into the story only enhances the sense of realism. Now, I don't want to scare anyone away. While the times were brutal, Martin is not overly graphic in a way some writers can be. It's there for a reason, not for only for shock effect.<br /><br />The kingdom sits on the brink...on the brink of war, destruction, and invasion. But no one realizes it yet. The noble families of the kingdom are about to be plunged into a web of lies and intrigue. Even the most honorable among them will find themselves doubting those they trusted the most and doing things would have never considered in the past. The peace has lasted too long and people are growing soft, but as they say, \\"Winter is coming.\\" And this one promises to be long.<br /><br />5/5past.

0316010669|3.0|I am a fan of Gladwell's work but his book \\"Blink\\" seemed a little light.  Increasingly, when modern research is telling us that our brains are easily tricked, this book seems to go against this trend.  I understand the concept of a gut check or gut instinct, but Galdwell seems to stress this above logic and sound reasoning.  I was always a fan of before any hard decision - sleep on it.  It is almost like he is saying that you can judge a book by its cover?  Isn't this how con artist operate (or shady used car salesmen).  They assume you will make snap decisions without really thinking it through.  In the end the book felt a little like a series of articles or short stories.  It never really felt whole.  If you want one of Gladwell's better works, read \\"Outliers\\".
B003Y5UP44|1.0|I adore Jane Eyre, and have been watching every adaptation I can get my hands on; the 2006 Masterpiece Theatre miniseries with Ruth Wilson is the best I've found so far, though the 1983 BBC version is more faithful to the book (almost slavishly so).<br /><br />This one is at the bottom of the heap. There are a few problems, but the most glaring is that William Hurt is profoundly miscast as Rochester. Hurt is a great actor, but his cerebral, detached style is inappropriate for the role of a virile, passionate, angry Byronic hero. Add this to the facts that a) Charlotte Gainsbourg, although she looks the part of Jane perfectly (you can see both \\"plain\\" and \\"unearthly\\" in her face), plays all of her character's outward demureness but none of her emotional restlessness or wit, and b) almost all of the couple's lighter, playful moments have been excluded in favor of inexplicable bickering that is not original to the book, and you have a complete lack of chemistry between the two leads. This would be fatal to the film even if it got everything else right. And it doesn't: it exaggerates some aspects of the story, like Jane's childhood rebelliousness, so that the viewer feels beaten over the head with the director's themes; severely curtails major plot points, e.g. St. John Rivers, such that it's unclear why the screenwriter bothered to include them at all; and wrongheadedly eliminates some of the best scenes in the book (I can forgive the exclusion of the \\"gypsy woman\\" scene, as I think that it's unfilmable as written -- who wants to see Jane Eyre as Lois Lane? -- but leaving out Rochester's explanation to Jane after the the existence of his wife is revealed is hugely detrimental to the emotional resonance of the movie. And lightning tree! I ask you, why would you leave lightning tree out of a Gothic romance? Why?). In general, it seems as though Zeffirelli was trying to focus on the quieter, more psychological aspects of the novel.

B0001XAOLQ|5.0|If one is a movie-history buff Das Boot is a must for your collection. Realistic,  gritty, excellent although not suberb acting. Numerous twist and turns as one would expect from Wolfgang Peterson. The sense of being in a U-boat with the claustrophobic affect is palpable. Cinamatography is terrific. Das Boot provides a view, even insight, into the German soldier as a \\"real\\" person with human feelings, rather than simply a fighting, mindless war machine.<br />Das Boot arrived on time and well packaged (I recieved an all German version, which, contained no English, and, the seller promptly corrected the problem.)<br />Das Boot is a guy movie...not a date movie. It is long in time running over 4 hours, so allow yourself an entire afternoon for viewing. Very entertaining, pathos, humor, some course appropriate language, failed human spirit, redemption, forgiveness, duty lost, duty gained, human frailties and fears overcome at times. Das Boot provides a small view into the German soldier's beliefs, doubts, psyche, strenghts, weakness and, his thoughts concerning war, love, hope, dreams and, humanity. Das Boot provides an unvarnished picture of a horrific war.

B001EN71CW|5.0|Have not seen this on blu-ray yet. But I have watched the series on Netflix, and I did see Serenity in the theater, and I love this show. Fox, you blew it big time with this one. This show is amamzing. This is Firefly folks. It's the best Sci Fi creation ever. It has to be awseome on blu-ray, it was great on Netflix, so it must kick ass on blu-ray. If you don't like this show then buy it, watch it, and get a clue.
B004A8ZX14|4.0|Saw this movie this past weekend & I thought it was a good movie. If you like Ashton Kutcher & Natalie Portman, you'll probably like this movie. I've gotta say that Natalie surprised me in this movie. She usually plays conservative roles. Her acting as usual is great. Ashton's acting was okay. They had good chemistry though. I didn't think it was that funny, but overall a good movie. I recommend this movie for an audience of 21 & up. Having a friend with benefits is always a recipe for disaster.     *Spoiler Alert* The only complaint I have about this movie is the part where Ashton's \\"dad\\" gets high in front of him & offers him some. This part almost ruined the movie for me. It's supposed to be a romantic comedy, not a get high fest!! Why does Hollywood portray getting high, getting drunk, & smoking as good things?? Why do people think these things are cool?? They're not...I find them to be stupid & unhealthy. I wish they would stop putting crap like this in movies. This is such a bad influence for our youth. That's all I have to say.

B004LRVFX4|5.0|This is one of the only movies I have ever seen that the english version is better than the original.  I liked the original a lot, but I liked this one much more, and I wasn't ready to.  I thought it would be a cheap recreation of an awesome foreign movie, but that's not the case.  The acting is better, the story is tighter, and the vampire is scarier.  The little boy in the movie is a really great actor.  I bet we will see a lot more of him.  The little girl was good too.  I love scary movies, and I've seen most of them, but this is definitely one of the best I've seen in a really long time.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|This show is the best horror series to come out on tv for many years and the fifth season was perhaps more apocalyptic than some viewers including myself would have liked. Still it was excellent in what they did as usual. The blu ray looks great and it has some good extras. The next series has returned the boys back to their hunting roots and that's good news for fans, but this one was a deep one with huge issues being weighed in the balance. although I bet st. michael could do without the apocalypse  just as much as the rest of us. Life is hard enough on this planet with earthquakes and tidal waves (like japan in march 11) washing thousands of people to their deaths, (or reactors giving off radiation later!) We need help down here and that's the truth , not be wiped out and that's why this show took a subject that obsesses millions of people (the end times) and stood the deal on it's head. Blu ray is the only way to grab this one imo , each set on blu ray just continues to shine in quality.  Keep hunting boys and thankfully they are on a different storyline now.
B0040QYROA|5.0|Fritz Lang's 1927 masterpiece \\"Metropolis\\" is the granddaddy of all sci-fi films, period. Without \\"Metropolis\\", there would be no \\"Forbidden Planet\\", no \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\", no \\"Star Wars\\", and no \\"Avatar\\". That this film was made over 80 years ago, with visual effects, scale, art direction and cinematography that are still mindblowing to this day, is a great testament to the trailblazing work Fritz Lang and his cast & crew achieved with this landmark film. Yes, the acting is a bit cheesy, and so is the allegorical tale about the heart mediating the hand and mind. But ya know, for this particular film, it really doesn't matter---\\"Metropolis\\" IS a silent movie from 1927, and the over-the-top acting and screenwriting style used in this film was simply par for the course back then. It's just the way they made movies back in 1927, and I accept that. And any shortcomings in the acting and script for \\"Metropolis\\" are more than made up for by all of the film's splendid, groundbreaking visual treats, of which there is plenty.<br /><br />Originally 153 minutes long when it premiered back in 1927, \\"Metropolis\\", sadly, has been horribly sliced and diced over the years, with some prints running as short as 90 minutes, as well as elements of the story being completely changed in the process. For many, many years, it seemed that a whole hour of the original \\"Metropolis\\" had been lost forever. But in 2002, a newly restored version of \\"Metropolis\\" was made with an additional 34 minutes of discovered footage, bringing the running time up to 124 minutes. (This version of \\"Metropolis\\" is still highly enjoyable, and is definitely worth having in your DVD collection.) And it appeared that the restored 2002 version would be the definitive version of \\"Metropolis\\" forevermore. But then, in 2008, a miracle happened: a nearly-complete, 148-minute 16mm print of \\"Metropolis\\" was discovered in a film vault in Buenos Aries, Argentina. It was badly scratched up, but nonetheless it contained nearly the entire original version of \\"Metropolis\\" as Fritz Lang originally created it (with only about 5 minutes of footage still missing, probably for good). The restoration team digitally cleaned up the missing 25 minutes of footage as much as humanly possible, and now, for the first time on DVD, we have \\"The Complete Metropolis\\" (well, nearly complete). And it's WONDERFUL!<br /><br />What a treat it is to watch this new, nearly-complete \\"Metropolis\\" on DVD---it's a whole new movie now. Although it's disappointing that the newly-discovered footage is of lesser quality than the rest of the film, I'm just happy to be able to watch it at all---the revelation that Fredersens's \\"butler\\" was actually working for him as a spy; the mini-adventure with worker 11811; that amazing elevator in the apartment of Freder's friend (you've really gotta see it!); the revelation that the worker mob were initially chasing the *real* Maria through the streets and not the robot Maria; and that beautiful, eye-popping statue of \\"Hel\\" (aka Helen). Wow. And, of course, there's more to enjoy now of the performances of the cast, including Gustave Frohlich as Freder and the eternally-lovely Brigitte Helm as Maria. What a treat to finally see it all (nearly) at last.<br /><br />I know Fritz Lang would be very pleased to have his \\"Metropolis\\" nearly restored to it's original length and glory at last, and he is smiling. And I am too! I thank The Big Guy upstairs that this miracle, nearly-complete print of \\"Metropolis\\" has survived for us to enjoy. With \\"Metropolis\\", Fritz Lang helped to shape the sci-fi film genre as we know it today. Thank you, Mr. Lang, for this classic, sci-fi masterpiece.
B001GCUO5M|1.0|What a let down. A horrible waste of talent all around. Don't waste your time. Lastly, I am very disappointed that the very amiable Max Von Sydow had to be sullied in this. So sad.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is an incredibly well written book about a woman whose death led to some of the most significant medical discoveries of the century, and the journey of discovery by her family, many years later, with Rebecca Skloot's help. Skloot writes about complex and key scientific discoveries and concepts in a way that makes them accessible to lay people, and she writes about Henrietta and her family with compassion and insight. The story is beautiful, fascinating, heart-breaking, and uplifting all at once. It is a reminder of some aspects of our history that do not make us proud, namely the treatment of blacks in the medical world. An amazing book. Read it.
030746363X|5.0|I was really inspired by the 4 hour Work Week Book - it's well written and jam packed with great ideas. 4 hour Body is just as good - it is filled with information that NO ONE ELSE is writing about ! Tim is a truly unique person - and original people are hard to find.
0756405890|5.0|Rothfuss made this book a sit on the edge of your seat, don't put it down until it's read type of novel.  Absolutely loved it.  I thought that the story had originality while fitting some classic archetype for the fantasy genre.  You won't be sorry!
1439102724|5.0|Sing You Home is Jodi Picoult's 18th novel.  Similar to her past novels, she tells the story from multiple viewpoints.  This one is different in that you only get three viewpoints- the three main characters- Max, Zoe, and Vanessa.  While I am used to many more views from her novels, I thought that for this one, the set up worked- after all, it really was a story that was about this triangle of people- the others were just peripheral.  And if you've ever loved someone, broken up with them, dated another person, but still had to work with the first in some way- it's what it is like.  This novel is also different in that it doesn't have her signature \\"twist\\" ending- but I like that she is playing with new formats and still able to write great stories.    Many people have commented about how the story feels not real because Zoe went too quickly into her lesbian relationship.  I have to say, I disagree.  As a lesbian, I have been in relationships and seen relationships where one person was assumed to be straight their whole lives and then they are dating someone of the same sex and it's like a fish in water.  For some people, it's like \\"ahh\\"... and there is very little of the \\"coming out drama\\" that most people associate.  I thought that she did a good job of en capturing that- and Vanessa's feelings that Zoe would leave her are very accurate.    Also, some people have mentioned that the Christians seem one-dimensional, I also disagree.  I consider myself to be a Christian and I have many evangelical christian friends and I grew up in the same state as Jerry Falwell...Picoult did a good job of demonstrating what it is like to discuss homosexuality with them.  She was not trying to make a statement about christianity, but rather the right wing, fundamental, evangelical christians- which are a small, but loud minority.  I did not take offense, and many of the arguments are arguments that I have grappled with as I try to link my sexuality and faith.    Overall, this was a great read- and I will read it again and again.  I think she did a good job of including the research, and like all of her books, I wish there were more - I never want her books to end!  :-)  I'm already looking forward to next years book
B003L20IJM|5.0|I can't believe people didn't like this one as much. I love fantasy films and Nanny Mcfee Returns is a million times better than the first. The special effects were fantastic. People were saying their wasn't enough Nanny Mcfee in this film however she was through out the entire movies. If you don't like this movie you must hate fantasies.

1439102724|5.0|Where do I start? I have been a fan of Jodi Picoult since I read My Sister's Keeper many years ago. Since then I have read all of her books and I love how they each tackle a different issue. Sing You Home is my favourite of her latest novels. I've always enjoyed Jodi's use of multiple \\"voices\\" and in this case it was perfect.     I liked Max's character the most I think. Not because he was the most likable, far from it. But because he was the most broken. The whole time I was of course rooting for Zoe and Vanessa, but I desperately wanted Max to find his way.    This is for Jodi Picoult: I can't imagine how hard it must be to read bad reviews. Just know that not everyone can understand everything you try to say through her books and that's ok. There's nothing you can do about that. Believe me, you did your job and it was an amazing one :-)
B0034G4ORC|3.0|First off, I want to say that I didn't find this movie to be all that bad, but at the same time it still wasn't very remarkable and certainly has quite a few glaring flaws in it.    [SPOILERS!]    PROBLEMS WITH THE STORY:  So here's the setting: In the movie it is well-known that the whole WORLD is under attack from these aliens and drones, yet our military, in spite of the fact that we are at an obvious technological disadvantage, decide to wait THREE HOURS to launch a bombing run on an area that in three-hours time may no longer be of any tactical importance? I think any general would bomb sooner and look for survivors later--especially when the fate of the whole PLANET is at risk.  At the end of the movie, we win by shooting one wimpy missile at a \\"Command Center\\" which causes all the flying drones to INSTANTLY fall out of the sky.   If Hollywood knew anything about drones they'd know that they don't just fall out the sky like rocks when the \\"command center\\" gets taken out.    LONG, LOUD AND TEDIOUS:  Those three words sum up my feelings about this movie rather well.   Now the movie is only about two hours long, but the pacing makes it feel longer than it is. I remember that towards the beginning there was a huge chunk where it was nothing but loud battle-sounds and pure action. When there is finally a break in the action, not only do you recognize this visually, but you can almost hear your ears give a sigh of relief after such an assault--one that starts back up again a little bit later.  As for the shaky-cam, it makes it extremely frustrating trying to SEE what is going on. Most notably towards the action-packed beginning of the movie. Have fun watching a red triangle cross-hair bounce all over the place and getting blurry glimpses of drones that look like scrap-yards and aliens that look like escargot.      SAVING GRACES:  On the positive side, I found the main character to be really interesting and felt that he did an excellent job acting his part. There arealso a few gems of dialogue: One happens after a girl gets slimed in the face by a dead alien. Another good one is towards the very end and has to do with breakfast.    OVERALL: Metacritic currently has this movie rated at 36 out of 100. I don't think I'd go that low. Something closer to 50 out of 100 is what I would rate it--assuming you see it in theater and only see it once. When this movie comes out on DVD I certainly have no plans on buying it, but for your typical alien invasion action movie, it's not too bad.
B003UESJHY|4.0|Can you follow your dreams without your family?  After a lifetime of being in his brothers shadow Micky (Wahlberg) finally gets the title shot he has been looking for.  The catch is neither his brother (Bale) who has trained him his whole life, or his mother (Melissa Leo) can have anything to do with him.  This is a great movie.  It is a boxing movie, but much like \\"Raging Bull\\" boxing is only part of the story.  The focus is mostly on the family and how important they are in Micky's life, and how they don't always return the love and need Micky has for them.  Being a true story (also like \\"Raging Bull\\") makes this movie much more enjoyable and tense, knowing that all of what is happening really went on.  Amy Adams is great in the movie.  This is a total departure from what she usually does (if you don't believe me watch this and then \\"Enchanted\\").  But I think this movie would not have been nearly as good without Bale.  To me he made this movie.  I felt it was a cross between \\"Raging Bull\\" and \\"Rocky\\", almost as good as both of them.  I give it an A-.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Yes I would
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I like this MUCH better then the 10th anniversary.  Alfie Boe was brilliant.  You won't be disappointed.  However, I must say that Nick Jonas was not as good I would have liked, so be prepared in that respect.
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|If you had a gift that ruined your life but helped others...would you use it?  After a traumatic expierence as a child George (Damon) receives a gift that allows him to connect to the afterlife.  After years of helping others he decided enough is enough and wants to stop and start living for him.  French journalist Marie (De France) goes through an expierence that leaves her with the same condition.  Finally Marcus, a boy, loses his brother and wants to try and talk to him again.  All three of these stories intertwine and we watch as each person tries to handle what life has thrown at them.  This movie was really good, but also very slow moving.  It reminded me alot of \\"Babel\\".  It switches pretty often between the three stories and you start to really feel for all three main stars and identify with thier problems.  With the events that just occured in Japan the opening takes on a whole new feel...good or bad it will effect you in a way the film makers probebly never intended.  Overall I liked the movie, but be prepared, it is slow moving and depressing.  I give it a B+.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Not right away
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie is probably one of the most bad-ass movies of it's time.  The story is very original and even has great visual effects including dismemberment. I would recommend it to anyone who loves anime and even some that don't pay to much attention to it.  As a movie on Roger Ebert's top 10 list it exceeds what you would expect from a movie.  It's easy to tell the atrists and writers of this classic worked hard and put a lot of creativity in their work.
B000002UB3|5.0|As the Beatle's were coming apart, they came together to create one of the greatest albums of all time.  The fact that that they could no longer stand to be in the same room together and yet create such a monumental album is incredible.  Every song in this collection is fantastic, but for my money side two is one of the greatest sides ever laid down on vinyl.  The flow and ebb of side two remains to this day, one of the greatest achievements in rock and roll history.  With out a doubt the greatest of the Beatle's albums.  If you don't have it, get it.
0307272702|5.0|If anyone has read author Gary Taubes' previous book, Good Calories, Bad Calories, they will know what the short answer is to Why We Get Fat: in a word, insulin. Taubes leads the book with numerous paradoxes to the conventional wisdom that fat people are simply overeating and underexercising. If you are overweight, you will no doubt be delighted to be vindicated from the \\"slothful glutton\\" image that doctors and media have branded you with.<br /><br />Taubes provides numerous examples of paradoxes--hardworking poor people with little money to purchase abundant food, yet are obese. An example are the Pima, impoverished Native Americans who became obese only when introduced to their non-native ways of eating (ie: sugar, canned foods, etc.) But he covers the globe with various examples. The most striking one is that of Brazilian women who are obese yet have thin, stunted, undernourished children. If we go by the idea that being fat is from overeating, we must assume these women are breaking all maternal instincts by letting their children starve so that they may overeat! But we are shown instead that the women are also undernourished.<br /><br />We are also given examples (including photos) of people who gained weight in various places (such as the hips, while being very slender in the upper body) due to genetics or to some disease.<br /><br />Gary makes a very convincing case that it is HORMONES that make us fat, and the main one is insulin. Insulin is secreted with a diet high in carbohydrates, most of which were introduced only since agriculture. In the presence of insulin, we cannot burn fat. Insulin causes the body to STORE fat. He goes into detail about all that happens with insulin--more detail than any of the dozens of books I have read on the topic while writing one myself (Beyond Broccoli). He explains how fat is not just \\"storage\\" but is like a tumor and has an agenda of growth.<br /><br />Taubes teaches what he calls \\"Adiposity 101\\" in a chapter called \\"The Laws of Adiposity.\\" Using studies, he shows that things are upside down, the opposite of what we think. We don't get fat because we overeat, but rather, we overeat because we get fat! Our body is tucking away calories in fat, thanks to hormones, and so we get hungry because we need calories for us to use. That is, we cannot access the stored fat properly. Also, \\"You don't get fat because your metabolism slows; your metabolism slows because you're getting fat.\\" This makes the book a superb paradigm-breaker.<br /><br />The one point I disagree with Taubes is his idea that carbohydrates are the only thing that make us fat, and calories don't count. I myself have gone on carb restricted diets and actually GAINED weight because I was eating too much fat! I think this is true especially with women: calories DO count. Yes, insulin is a huge factor. But put me on a diet of an excess 500 or so calories of fat a day, and even if it is zero carb, I will gain a pound a week!  (OK, in ketosis, it might take 700 calories a day...)<br /><br />The appendix details what foods to eat and what to avoid....<br /><br />Susan Schenck, author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit & Planet<br />and<br />Beyond Broccoli, Creating a Biologically Balanced Diet When a Vegetarian Diet Doesn't WorkLaws of Adiposity.\\" Using studies, he shows that things are upside down, the opposite of what we think.

B0042X9L6A|5.0|I am new to DSLR's and bought a D5000 last year at Christmas, I am new into the world DSLR's and needed somewhere to grow, which is why I bought the D5000.  I wanted more light while taking pictures so I looked at the SB 600 and 700.  I purchased this flash to use with my Nikon D5000, the flash on the camera is weaker than I would have liked and I take a lot of pictures in door so I spent the money.  I was looking at the sb 600 instead but I wanted the ability to turn the flash at angles to bounce the light off of other walls rather then the ceiling and forward only.  I love the flash, while it was a bit more expensive then I would have spent, I am very happy now to have it and it is making a great difference in my pics.    So far it is great, I have not used many of the personalization settings, changing the wavelength or commander setting(which is nice to have if I get more flashes), but I do rotate direction and angle often to get the best pics.  You tube videos on good use have been great too.  I think if most people buy this they will not be disappointed.  Good Luck

B0034G4OXQ|3.0|On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 6.9. Here's the breakdown:<br />(All of my reviews are also on [...] if you want to see it with pictures.)<br /><br />Screenplay<br />9.0<br /><br />The screenplay for this movie is excellent. I think Clint Eastwood's greatest strength as a director is his ability to create lifelike characters, and this movie is no exception. I love the way that he makes the viewer feel distant from Marcus' foster family and pretty much everyone in Marie and George's lives. Eastwood makes the viewer care about the characters and feel their loneliness and isolation. The characters feel so rich and human; they are anything but shallow or one-dimensional.<br /><br />The first half of this movie focuses mostly on character development. It felt rather slow and tedious when I first watched it, however it ultimately pays off. Each of the story lines is independent until the end of the movie, and the way the filmmakers bring together three compelling story lines is really elegant.<br /><br />Hereafter is a very well written movie. The dialogue feels natural; it never feels forced.  There are tons of one-liners that are poetic and wise.<br /><br />Acting<br />9.0<br /><br />I was worried about the acting quality of this movie at one point. One of the twins (Jason) definitely showed some weak acting at a few times. Luckily, they kill him off pretty early on on the movie, and his twin brother was a superb actor. I swear, the quality of child actors seems to be getting better and better lately.<br /><br />Matt Damon delivers a stellar performance. He is great at playing people with unique abilities and head injuries. (Borne series) Damon brings those same skills to the table here. The actress who plays Marie does a very good job of delivering both her English lines and her French lines. (about a quarter of her lines are in English and the rest are in French) Marcus' mom plays the part of a heroin addict perfectly.<br /><br />Despite my initial concerns, the acting quality in Hereafter ended up being one of the movie's greatest strengths.<br /><br />Style<br />8.5<br /><br />I liked the style of this movie a lot. The three story lines take place in England, France, and San Fransisco. Eastwood gave the scenes a strong local vibe and the result is a movie with a very international ambiance.<br /><br />The special effect that is used during the near death scenes and psychic connection scenes is beautiful. When George goes into a psychic state, there are many figures in an open area. The colors seem almost inverted and ethereal.  When he is focused on one person, they appear detailed and vibrant; the other spirits are shadowy and vague.<br /><br />The computer generated tsunami looked fantastic. Few movies can match the realistic appearance and motion of the water in this scene. The destruction of the tsunami is very intense. You see bodies, cars, boats, and even buildings being swept up by the water and carried inland. People are caught in downed power lines and electrocuted. The whole tsunami scene is very intense and jarring.<br /><br />Genre Comparison<br />5.5<br /><br />I don't know whether I would consider the genre of this movie to be a Clint Eastwood movie or, to be a drama about the afterlife. Either way, this movie shines. Clint Eastwood makes fantastic dramas dealing with the subject of death. The bar has already been set high, and this movie doesn't make the cut. This is mainly because it doesn't leave you with a clear message; just with some things to think about.<br /><br />Originality<br />6.5<br /><br />Hereafter is mostly original. I haven't seen many other movies that looked at near death experiences from the same angle as this movie. The view of death portrayed in this movie is pretty standard. I'm mean, its not a Judeo-Christian perspective, but its fairly mainstream in the way it shows psychics and death. For example, for the near death experience, they showed bright lights and dead relatives. The psychic reading scenes had the typical \\"I'm getting a strong signal related to the month June. Does June mean anything to you?.\\" Very John Edwards-esque.<br /><br />I thought the structure of the plot was pretty original though.<br /><br />Message<br />1.0<br /><br />This is where Hereafter fell flat. The message of this movie was very vague. The resolution to the conflict basically did nothing to portray a meaningful message, unless of course you are a psychic. It mostly just left you with a few things to think about and, as I mentioned before, those few things are basically mainstream metaphysical ideas. Maybe I was a little harsh in scoring this section, but it really is a glaring omission.<br /><br />Huevos Factor<br />5.0<br /><br />This was a tough one to grade. It was well written and the acting was good. I want to love it, but it never really drew me in. In many ways its a quality movie, but it's missing some things. Overall, its not bad, but it's not a movie I'd watch again and again.<br /><br />Hereafter comes out on DVD and Blu-ray on March 15.<br /><br />Breakdown:<br />Screenplay<br />9.0<br />Acting<br />9.0<br />Style<br />8.5<br />Genre Comparison<br />5.5<br />Originality<br />6.5<br />Message<br />1.0<br />Huevos Factor<br />5.0<br /><br />Overall<br />6.9I thought the structure of the plot was pretty original though.

B00005N6KG|4.0|I bought these headphones for the gym because my Sure E3C's wouldn't stay in the my ear while exercising. The sound quality is decent for the price. The headphones stay put even while jogging. The build quality is decent although I don't expect to get more than a year of use out of the headphones. The only issue I have with them is the cord length. The cord just isn't long enough. I'm 6'3\\" and the cord isn't long enough for me to have my iPod in my pocket. I had to buy a headphone extension cord to solve this. I'd rate the headphone 5 stars if the cord was a foot longer.

B000SLQGGS|5.0|The rhythm of the Blues is birthed down and dirty like Georgia clay or Mississippi mud. It is where the musician's feet seek out the surface to beat against which matches the cadence of the emotional flow that first quickens the heart to react discordantly to the pain of love gone wrong. As Son House, legendary blues singer and guitarist, tells us: \\"I'm talkin' about the Blues... When two people, supposed to be in love, when one or the other deceives the other through their love...\\" It starts with a wail, a scream, a guttural cry from the throat of a seasoned songster or, maybe a saxophone will tell that part, and next the story behind it all is laid out in spades. Then, we cry. The Blues. There is nothing better on earth by which to heal a broken heart, whether that broken heart be from a failed marriage, loss of a loved one, a broken friendship for no good reason under the sun... All loss is like death, and listening to the blues is like having someone, even a stranger we just met at P.K.'s Place, who understands our innermost feelings sit right alongside us to grieve them to the ground.<br /><br />What 'Black Snake Moan', the movie, does is move us deeper to explore the underbelly of pain. It exposes the sheer ugliness of it, a portion of the malevolence of that which causes it and then it tears off the veil of the lie that says it can go away if you just want it bad enough. Moreover, it does not devalue the persons who experience pain and its effects. Is their (Rae and Ronny's) plight hopeless? Who knows? There has to be hope or let us just grant every nation permission to push the big red button that will allow us our collective journey to stand before our Maker. The fact that Laz reached out to help while mired deep in the newness of his own blues tune added a redemptive note. How beautiful with that gospel tone insinuated into his own despondent melodia. And, finally, the key to that redemption in the tone of black - sharp, but steady on. He found this ivory skinned doll, laid flat and damaged and then chose to take her in and let the melody of his father soul fuse with that of the child and ... well, you'll just have to see.<br /><br />Samuel Jackson and Christina Ricci are two very fine actors and this movie is great for their contribution. S. Epatha Merkerson is an excellent addition to anything she is involved in, and this is no exception. While Justin Timerberlake may not possess finely honed acting skills at the point of this movie, what I saw in 'Social Network' certainly shows steady, quality growth. For crying out loud!

0756404738|5.0|Firstly, this book is every bit as good as NOTW. I've read the first book somewhere around ten times and there are tons of promises set forth in the first book that are followed up on (also it's a trilogy...not everything will be told, of course). Sure, they may not have been what every reader expected, but they were real. Remember, you got a taste of the myth of Kvothe in the first book. Now you're getting the real story. It's a story without the grapevine embellishments.<br /><br />  Second, this book is written with a lot more depth. It requires at least an extra read through to fully grasp the currents. There were a few things I wish were different. A few reveals weren't done nearly as cleverly as I would have liked. But I don't blame Pat. There are times I've written something and had to think:\\"Will the reader really catch it if I'm this subtle?\\" (POSSIBLE SPOILER FROM BOOK 1: ie, when Kvothe is angered at the beginning of NOTW, he breaks a bottle of wine that reminded him of Denna.) It was small, simple, subtle, and told volumes, and there were still moments like that in the second book. There were also glaringly obvious reveals (but those may have been misleading on purpose...we'll see.)<br /><br />  There is a maturity to the writing--along with the character-- that wasn't present before. If the plot seems to plod, look a little deeper. Look at what's behind the reason. Look at the changes that are actually there, not the topical aspect. It's easy to say :Kvothe did this, went here, now he's a superawesome music playing legend that everyone cherishes like their first-born child's first words.<br /><br />  But that wouldn't be true. Rothfuss has created a HUMAN character, with human limits. He's not perfect. Look at the changes in his personality, his voiced and unvoiced internal struggles. Especially the unvoiced ones. Look a little deeper and listen to the story being silently, or quietly, told. There seem to be two main simultaneous story lines. In one, Kvothe is living his life. In the other, Kvothe's life is shifting at all times. It's like the waking mind and the sleeping mind. It's all there, but can you see it?
030746363X|4.0|This book seems to either incite vehement condemnation or blinding devotion in most reviews online, and I think both miss the point. Though perhaps for a good reason, since Timothy Ferriss goes out of the way to market it as a quantum leap in personal health and improvement, which this is not. Here is mine, and strictly mine, opinion: the book is excellent. As someone who followed its diet plan (but stuck to a more classic exercise routine) while following many of the smaller tips, and lost 23lbs while also building muscle, I can't help but praise the book. But it is excellent for reasons which are not as obvious.     First of all, many of the negative reviews seem to be written by (if they are to be believed) highly athletic and healthy people. This book is not targeted at this demographic. (Though it seems to be marketed at them just the same.) To sight one of the more popular condemnations without mentioning any names, at which point did a black-belt wielding, athletic doctor think this book was going to make a massive change on his life? Though the book does not make this clear, it is most useful for those who are out of shape and are either unfamiliar with exercise and diet, uncomfortable with it, or simply not motivated enough to stick with it.    Second, the manner in which this book is useful is also misunderstood. I believe what it is, first and foremost, is a motivational guide to how become healthier without committing oneself to an unsustainable rigor of three-hour gym sessions off the bat. The problem here is once again induced by the book itself, which takes a somewhat schizophrenic approach to its methodology. Starting with the example when a man lost sixty pounds in a year by doing nothing more than measuring oneself religiously, it takes the correct path of stating what without measurement almost all attempts at sustainable weight-loss will be unsuccessful. Because this is the kind of progress we would all like to see, gain with no pain, it is not clear enough in pointing out that it in fact views this only as a minor part of what it lays out. In fact, Mr. Ferriss is clear in stating that the diet he advocates (while not groundbreaking as he might hint at) is in fact hard work. As he himself points out, to loose weight you must diet, exercises and/or do drugs (which he in fact seems to mostly oppose), choosing the ration of one to the other based upon your personal abilities and drive. To emphasize this point further, however, would be counterproductive to sale figures in modern society, and thus this point is lost as he proceeds to dive into various short-cuts to help you on your way to being 'superhuman'.     This brings us to the third point: the validity of these shortcuts. They bare the brunt of criticism, and correctly so. But this is because of the above emphasis on them, as Mr. Ferriss seems to skim over the exercise and diet part, which he seems to assume we get from his constant humorous remarks to his own gym prowess. Does taking garlic extract three or four times a day going to help you loose weight? Yes. Is it going to show if you do not follow the rest of the diet and exercise? Absolutely not. Something tells me this holds true for almost all of the remaining tips he brings up.    Fundamentally, the book is weak in that it does not rigidly lay out this expectation that most of these tricks are not going to work unless the diet and exercise are followed first. However, if they are, than it might indeed come close to changing your life. Many things which work on someone who is a health-nut and at peak of physical prowess like Mr. Ferriss are not going to work on most of our fat assess. (Lets be honest here, most of us bought it to loose weight, not for the book's muscle-gain or orgasm-inducing chapters.) Furthermore, most of his tips are not as new as he claims them to be. Yet as far as I can ascertain, if you are out of shape and follow his advice, you are going to get much healthier and rather quickly. And if your only criticism is that what he says is nothing new, why are are already not skinny and bench pressing your own body weight?    My suggestion is you buy this book as a humorous romp through one man's obsession with health and use his story and his tips as a way to motivate yourself to emulate his success. If you expect that reading it while stuffing pizza down your throat seven days a week is going to help you because it told you to take a pill three times a day, you are thoroughly mistaken.
0312370849|4.0|This book is really good. I borrowed it from a friend and read it fairly quickly. As someone who loves history, it's nice to read a historical fiction
B0043RSJ8G|2.0|I have read most of Jodi's books and this is by far the worst that I have read.  I felt that everything was happening to quickly that it just was not believable and the ending was like ok? they went through a whole trial for nothing.    Skip this book. Don't waste your money
B0000AK7A8|5.0|This is a riotously funny, somewhat romantic movie with a great cast.  I love Eric Idle.  I think he is funny just standing there.  With the addition of Father Guido Sarducci as the exorcist, it is just too funny.  I love how he is holding the Bible, a lemon, and a head of garlic.  The cameo appearances of a lovely line of actors is also just great.  This is a great movie with a great sense of humor.
B000Z27HLS|2.0|Just not well put together, chopped in pieces, story lines lost....... keeps you wondering, really what's the point???  Characters were good though, I commend them.
B002ZG981E|1.0|Right from the start, the plot was very hard to follow (with sub-plots between Di Caprio and his wife that were equally, if not more so, hard to follow/swallow), and although there are a lot of cool special effects, and lots of action, this movie is devoid of a believable premise.  The dreamworld in Inception - which consisted of a series dreams within dreams scene's - was way over-the-top, leaving the movie watcher wondering at any particular moment during the movie, \\"where was the scene was taking place: is it reality, or a dream, or a dream within a dream, or a dream within a dream within a dream?\\"  This movie ends up being nothing more than a poorly conceived twist of the Matrix, or more specifically, a \\"Matrix Wannabe\\" type movie -- it attempts to do with dreams what Matrix did with a virtual world created by computers, but fell sadly short.  I couldn't wait for the embedded dream events (dreams within-dreams) to unwind, and for the movie to be over.  Ironically, this movie puts forth the idea that five minutes in reality is about an hour in dream-time, and although this movie is approx. 2.5 hours long, it felt like well over 10-hrs to me .... and when done, it then left me wondering, whose dreams are they anyway?
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Ryan and Sandra...how charming and delightfully funny!  Absolutely love it! Wish they would make more productions together, they just mesh so well, wonderful actors. If I'm feeling blue, I just watch this movie and it all goes away.
B003YFIUW8|1.0|After reading all these glowing reviews, I decided to download to kindle. i just finished the firt chaper and don't plan on reading any more of it. I don't think the voice of the kid rings true and already I don't like these people. I love books about children and just don't get this one. Will save for a rainy day or when I can't find anything else to read ( That will never happen ) would not recommend this to anyone.
B000244FDW|1.0|I was never so disappointed in my life.  I have seen 3 versions of Pride and Prejudice and this by far is the absolute ruin of them all.  The A&E production is awesome,Colin and Jennifer are the best. I couldn't stand to watch this BBC one more than once, it was like drudging through MUD! It's like a small town amateur theater play. Very mundane and hard for me to get into after the one with Colin and Jennifer. No fluency and so choppy and direct, it's like the characters weren't even real............. totally disgusted with this one, and a waste of money.
B00475AYJQ|3.0|CONCERNS-  Going into this second book of the series, I had several concerns.  The first concern was that this series would end up being a rehash of EarthSea and/or Harry Potter.  The first book was much more detailed and lively than The Wizard of Earthsea, but the similarities between this and Earthsea could not be ignored: Back story of the world's greatest wizard, attending the university, finding the names of things for magic, etc etc.  The other concern was, rather than venturing into an Earthsea type series, it would slow way down and become a Harry Potter, year-by-year at school kind of series. And the final concern I had, was that this would delve into a GRRM complex - that is, become a great series, but the plot advancement would be so slow that it would take 9 books to finish, and that the author would start taking decades off between books - so that we'd have to watch an HBO miniseries in 20 years to find out how the entire story ends.    After reading most of the second book, I can say that it certainly isn't going by the way of Earthsea, even if the storylines started out the same.  However, based on the pace of the books, I'm not sure about concern #2 or concern #3 - we'll just have to wait and see how the next book(s) go.  I will say, since the pace is so slow, that I would not be in any hurry to start reading this series until more books come to print.  There really is nothing worse than getting addicted to a story, only to find out that you will forget most of the details by the time the next books comes out.    STORY-  With that said, this is one of the better series I have read in a long, long time.  The author does a superb job at developing lively characters, using excellent dialogues, and world building.  The author does not use excessive amounts of words (and needless I might say) to bore us to tears with overwrought descriptions.  The only period of the novel I was worried, was near the middle when the they spend loads of time doing not muchin the forest.  I'm not sure if this was intentional, because Kvothe himself was supposed to be bored, but I found myself growing bored as well, and hoping to skim along the story until it got better.  I also dreaded any of the future interlude scenes.  I found the present day storyline with Bast, the Chronicler, and Kote - to be quite boring.  I can only hope it gets better as the past story catches up and the storylines merge.    CONCLUSION-  Overall, this is a cut rate first couple of books, to what I hope is an excellent series for all of us to enjoy.  I'm still concerned at the pace of the storyline - we have to cover all of Kote's life up until now, but so far have covered very little - know little of the Chandrian, etc AND the pace of the books coming out to print.  I would certainly add this to a list of books to read, but I might hold off until more books come out to avoid the GRRM complex.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I can't say enough about this movie........ it's totally AWESOME, I love the characters, the scenery and settings... it just blends so well, I watch it at least once a month. SUPER DUPER!!!
B002BJGYU8|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed. This season kept me even more enthralled than the first. The deleted scenes are more appropriately spread through out so you don't have to wait for the end of the whole season like you did with the first season. You get to become further acquainted with the shows wonderful characters.
B004M3GDI4|5.0|This is my second headlamp I have ever owned. First I owned some energizer 7 led lamp, which had horrible spotted lighting, and the strap was lose even when it was fully tightened. the light was not very bright, and I don't think it was IP rated or very robust.  I work in a industrial environment building electrical panels for automated machinery. This is perfect.  It has close range, close/far, and far lighting modes which are very nice. the light is perfectly distributed and is very bright. The selector knob is large and easy to use. It has a lot of up down positioning, and the strap is very robust. This lamp is IP rated to be under water and to be treated roughly. The price is not too bad, plus the LEDS are of pretty new technology as far as i know, and the headlamp uses some sort of smart power system that allows the light to run at full brightness for 24-48 hours and then drop off slowly instead of dropping off right from the beginning. I honestly give this 5 stars and would give it more if I could. I did not purchase mine from amazon, and As far as reliability, I can't say much because I just came out, but It seems to be pretty solid. I suggest anyone who needs a nice headlamp for a low price, buy this headlamp. PERFECT GOOD JOB PETZL
0756404738|3.0|I had really enjoyed the first book, but I think the only part of the second book that matches the first one is Patrick Rothfuss' brilliant writing style. In terms of plot and characters this one really falls short of my expectations.     As other people mentioned the main plot seems to advance very little and I completely agree with the comment saying Kvothe's journeys seems like unrealistic interludes that are just there to say he advanced his skills in this and that. I really wish I would be able to say better things about the book, but every time you are relieved that the current unnecessarily long subplot that goes nowhere has finished, a new one pops up. It was as if Kvothe was producing this TV show where he introduces different cultures from Rothfuss' fantasy world in every episode, but he didn't really care about what each episode added to the main plot at all.    I read the first half of the book in two days and the rest went at a very slow pace and I finished only because I wanted to be done with it. Don't get me wrong, I will still preorder the third one(and the fourth if the trilogy becomes a quartet), but my expectations won't run as high as the second book. I think Rothfuss is an exceptionally good author and from following his blog also a great person. His world is interesting and compelling enough to produce many stories, but I am not so fond of Kvothe's story anymore.
B003Q6D25K|3.0|Depicting the events leading up to Paranormal Activity, PA 2 tells the story of Katie's [Katie Featherston] sister, Kristi [Sprague Grayden and husband, Dan [Brian Boyland], their daughter, Ali [Molly Ephraim] and their infant son Hunter. The demonic events chronicled in PA started in Kristi and Dan's house several weeks before. There are thumps and bumps, objects moving on their own, and a eerie basement that fascinates the demon, who seems focused on Hunter. Dan refuses to believe the goings-on are supernatural, but Kristi and Ali are convinced. As the demon's activity escalates, we learn how the events in PA began.<br /><br />This sequel works in some ways, but,ultimately, given that we know what the outcome will be from PA, the events are anti-climactic and the slow pacing that worked well in PA grows tedious in PA2. Worth seeing if you are a PA fan, as it fills in some of the backstory of PA, though not enough as we would like.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|I'm very happy with my purchase I just got into watching Doctor Who and was excited to see it on here new for cheaper than in-store prices. I would recommend this to anyone as a gift or something if they are into BBC sci-fi shows
044024367X|4.0|Considering all the Lee Child books I've read, Nothing to Lose was one of the better ones but not the best. Since I started reading Child, the books have been thoroughly enjoyable and have taken place in different locations. This one takes place in Colorado in two towns called Hope and Despair. As always, the hero, Jack Reacher, stumbles upon strange goings-on within the town of Despair. Bouncing back and forth between the two towns, Reacher uncovers events that he can't quite put his finger on. As usual, he uses his fists to solve any and all problems, something I've come to expect in one of these novels.  I found this entry fast reading and recommend it with mild reservations as there are better ones out there.

0440246016|5.0|Considering all the Lee Child books I've read, Bad Luck and Trouble was one of the best. In this entry, Jack Reacher, the hero, reunites with his former comrades from the Army to look into the disappearance of two other associates. In a story that goes back and forth between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, they uncover what happened to their former buddies and bring closure for them.<br /><br />I found this entry fast reading and recommend it highly and without any reservations.
1439102724|2.0|I only read a few beginning chapters and had to put this book down.  I may pick it up again one day.  I give it two stars for the spot on accuracy of the description of the pain and agaony of infertility.  However I do no recommend it for anyone that actually HAD infertility.  The graphic depictions at the beginning of the book are overwelming and could spur PTSD or severe anxiety and/or panic attacks for a woman that may have actually EXPERIENCED some of these same types of feelings as the main character.    I hope that one day I will be able to see if this book ends happily.  But if you haven't dealt and moved past the emotional baggage that accompanies infertility, probably best to leave this one on the shelf.
0439023513|4.0|THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS!!!!    Well the ending wasn't what I expected especially after reading first two books. I think that the author went too far with killing Prim. That was simply too much. I wish there was more romance between Katniss and my ultimate favotire Peeta. Instead of focusing on brutality of war, the author should focus more on Katniss-Peeta-Gale love triangle. I did love the book. It was full of suspense and surprises, I just wished for a better ending. I hated to see all my favorite characters in so much pain, especially Peeta who simply wasn't the same great guy anymore. I got really attached to all the characters, and fell totally in love with them. I was rooting for Peeta since the beginning, and I was really glad that at the end he was with Katniss but it kinda felt like they ended up together because they both were so mentally damaged...it didn't feel like love at all

B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon.  Well what can one say that has not already been said in respect of this landmark album.  For me and I suspect many others, Dark Side of Moon was the quissential albumn not just of its era but in fact of all time, in terms of rock music history.    It is the link between the early and more experimental sounds of early Floyd with the more commerically successful music of later Floyd.  I still remember the first time I heard this albumn as a teenager and being totally blown away by it. For me some 30 years on, it still creates the same feeling albeit, I know what to expect, as I have heard it that many times.    Dark Side of the Moon, was only a few years ago voted the best albumn ever in Triple J's (Australia) Top 100 albumns, and deservedly so.  No albumn comes close to it in terms of the purity and intelligence/creativity which went into making this albumn.      For me there are no bad tracks on this albumn but there are definitely some really special tracks. The opening sequence on Speak to me/Breathe is spine tingling, the ambiance of the variety notes created in Time due to the clocks chiming, to the inherant melancholy behind The Great Gig in the Sky to the timelessness and pertinance of the message today behind Money are just but a few of the best tracks.     Simply awesome !!
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|Being a guy, it's hard to relate to every longing serenade here, but that's beside the point.  The fact is,  Adele's tremendous talent can't be denied.    In an era dominated by ostentatious frauds like Justin Beiber and Lady Gagagagagaga, this young woman's voice harkens back to the days of Fontella Bass and the like.  She is not only a breath of fresh air but a punch to the gut.  There's an indescribable power to her sound.    There are many who profess themselves to be \\"singers,\\" but Adele is one of the few who can actually effing SING.
0393338827|5.0|The Quicken loan ads I heard on my car radio in 2005 rattled me every time I heard them.  Who could be so stupid as to make adjustable-rate loans, with no money down, resetting to God knows what rate after only two years?  Whose money was being lent, and who would be so stupid as to take such a mortgage?<br /><br />I have been watching the preternatural rise of home builders such as Pulte, Toll Brothers and others for several years.  It made no conventional sense.  Where could the demand be coming from?  Now I understood.  The houses were being pushed on people too naïve to know better, or with nothing to lose by buying them.  It was a disaster in the making, a train wreck.  In 2005 I asked my friend Denny how to short this thing.  Neither of us could figure it out.<br /><br />And that was as far as it went for me, the general optimist in the casual investor.  I did not connect the dots to see how it would wreck the economy, or to see how to make big money on it.  Other people did, and Michael Lewis tells their story in a gripping fashion.  What do we learn?<br /><br />Even before the application of Michael Lewis' gift for hyperbole, the players were a distinctively odd group.  A one eyed victim of Asperger's syndrome who never left his home office in California, and sussed the whole thing out by pure logic.  A trio of misfits from Berkeley who did not want to do anything conventional with their lives, and did the same.  A couple of frenetic Jewish traders in the financial markets New York City whose wild eyed prophecy that the financial world was crashing got them branded as nuts.<br /><br />What these guys did, and virtually nobody else, was to pry into the guts of the esoteric instruments that were used to financial this crisis: collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit default swaps.  When they got to the bottom they determined that not even they could understand them.  They had the chutzpah, after many attempts and many questions, to conclude that if they couldn't understand them, and nobody could explain them, they must simply be a scam.  These were guys who were willing to say that the emperor had no clothes and were willing to bet big money on it.<br /><br />What the CDOs did was to bundle large groups of mortgages into a package and sell the rights to the income streams generated by those mortgages.  The genius was to package them into tranches, the most risky mortgages paying a higher returns than the supposedly less risky ones.  The second part of the genius was to have the rating agencies, Moody's, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch, rate these packages of debt.  The rating scheme assumed that the risks of default for each individual loan were statistically independent.  There would be only a 30 percent correlation between the default risk of any two loans.  This to a statistician would mean that the default of one loan would only have nine percent explanatory power for the default of another loan in the package.  All of this looks absurd in retrospect, but it meant that the majority of such collateralized debt packages could be AAA rated.<br /><br />The coveted AAA rating meant that such loans could be held by very conservative investors, among them, it becomes clear among the smoldering ruins, a vast number of European banks, but also, to a surprising large degree, the American banks that generated this toxic mess.  The executives did not understand the financial legerdemain going on at the working levels, and actually believed the ratings that their underlings had worked so assiduously to get from the poor, dumb, underpaid workers at the rating agencies.<br /><br />There was tremendous incentive to keep the party going.  Everybody was making money, and passing the risk downstream.  These incentives led to increasingly loose criteria for originating loans.  You know the terms: &#34;Liar Loans&#34; in which there was no credit verification, and &#34;Ninja&#34; loans: no income, no job, no assets.  And, increasingly, adjustable-rate loans which would reset in two years.  These were the Quicken loans, virtually guaranteed to go into default.  Perversely, the default would mean more money for the loan originators who would at a minimum have a chance for more fees in refinancing the mortgage, and at best repossessed and resell the property.  It is a process that was called at the time &#34;Loan to Own.&#34;  Make a loan in which the lender cynically projects owning the property when the borrower defaults.<br /><br />Lewis's protagonists saw the impending disaster, but they had the same frustration I did, not seeing a way to short it.  One could short the homebuilders, and one could short the big investment houses such as Lehman and Bear Stearns, but it was difficult to short actual mortgages, and they were the pure play.  Not, however, entirely!  The big investment houses had their own device for spreading risk.  It is called a credit default swap.  It is essentially an insurance policy.  If the lenders in a certain packet of CDOs were to default above a certain rate, the insurance would pay off.  AIG was the biggest of the firms to write such policies, and they wrote them only for their peers in the financial community.  Retail investors need not apply.<br /><br />A part of Lewis' drama is how the small players whose tales he tells managed to acquire such insurance, making this bet against the market, even though they did not own any such CDOs, in other words, did not own anything which might merit ensuring.  His gift as a storyteller is to lead the casual reader through these canyons of machinations and somehow understand the journey and appreciate the suspense along the way.  He also chronicles quite clearly the duplicity and self-dealing of the large financial firms, refusing ever to give the small guys a fair shake.<br /><br />It was interesting to me to see that the big-name short-sellers on Wall Street, in particular Rocker partners, with whom I have had some contact, did not figure out exactly how to play this.  They knew which way the market would go, but got themselves into trouble through naked shorts of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.  They attempted to use brute force, as opposed to the elegant approaches used by Lewis'heroes.<br /><br />There is much more to the story than Lewis chooses to tell, but it would detract from his highly readable narrative and focused storyline.  This product is exactly what he wanted: the kind of book that I would pick up at noon and spend until midnight finishing.

There is much more to the story than Lewis chooses to tell, but it would detract from his highly readable narrative and focused storyline.  This product is exactly what he wanted: the kind of book that I would pick up at noon and spend until midnight finishing.  A gripping story, impeccably told.
0553805371|4.0|This book walks the reader through how our natural environment and fundamental physical laws are so remarkably finely tuned, they are difficult to explain. From the Goldilocks zone our planet enjoys being a perfect distance from the sun for life to exist, the almost perfect orbit for consistencey of temperature, to the perfect balance of the nuclear forces, electromagnetism, and gravity; and to Einstein's cosmological constant. Since all matter attracts other matter, he added an antigravity force to his theory to nullify the tendency of the universe to collapse on itself. It is a mysterious force that is built into the very fabric of space-time. Can we derive meaning from this \\"perfect accident?\\"<br /><br />Hawking and Mlodinow guide you through each step in man's knowledge as it powerfully suggested the universe was designed specifically for us, then further knowledge derided that notion, then back again; taking the reader on a very interesting and enlightening trip. What will you decide after you read this?<br /><br />Joe Arrigo<br />Author of, The Secret Factor for Uncommon Sales Success
0684833395|3.0|As a member of the \\"Viet Nam\\" generation who never went to war, I can understand how I might have thought this book was \\"Right On !\\" 40 years ago ... if I had read it back then.    But, I only got around to reading it last month at age 60, and I have to say, it left me rather cold and unimpressed.    My Dad was a B-25 pilot in WWII flying missions overseas.  He was in pretty much the same situation as the characters in \\"Catch-22\\".      Over the years, he has provided me with many insights that have helped me understand what it was like.  He has both humorous anecdotes about military inefficiency and tales of what it's like to fly over enemy territory while people on the ground are trying to kill you.    Absolutely nothing he has ever told me gives me any indication that the fictional situation described in the novel \\"Catch-22\\" is anything other than extreme exaggeration for the purpose of making a point.    Of course, the point the Joseph Heller is making is valid at a certain level.      But, his heavy-handed way of telling his story is so completely over-the-top that it just sort of misses the mark in my opinion and because he is so willing to hammer his point home in such a fashion, he compromises his credibility.
B004L3AR0K|3.0|The main problem with \\"Love and Other Drugs\\" is that, throughout the duration of the film, it seems to be suffering from a constant identity crisis. The film can't seem to decide if it wants to be:<br /><br />a) a conventional romantic comedy<br />b) a Judd Apatow-style comedy about an overgrown man-child who finally grows up<br />c) a serious drama about falling in love with someone with a degenerative illness or<br />d) a satire of the health care industry<br /><br />What salvages the film are its two leads. Anna Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal first appeared together in \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" playing two people stuck in a passionless marriage of convenience. In \\"Love and Other Drugs,\\" the two play a couple madly in lust, and, despite their better judgment, love with one another. Both Hathaway and Gyllenhaal are talented, charismatic, and very sexy actors and each give their characters the depth the film desperately needs (especially since all of the supporting characters are hopelessly two dimensional.) Gyllenhaal plays Jamie as a lothario whose superficial charm masks a deep-seated emptiness. Hathaway's Maggie is full of sexual bravado and sharp-tongued wit, but scratch the surface and her character's anger and bitterness about her young-onset Parkinson's comes raging to the surface.<br /><br />The film is worth a watch just for the great performances and chemistry of its leads. But much of the film comes across as trite, especially since it deals with such heavy subject matter, and the ending is just an embarrassing Rom-Com clich&eacute;.
0312370849|5.0|I couldn't put the book down!  It is a wonderful juxtaposition of two stories taking place at two different time periods.  I'm a francophile so of course I love a story where an American lives in France and all about Paris and French stuff. And I'm interested in WWII.  But aside from the subject matter, it's been quite awhile since I've read a book that carries me away to another time and place to the point of not knowing where I am for a split second when I look up.  This is a rare book that can be both lyrical and so interesting at the same time.  I wait for months if not years to find this kind of writing.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|First off let me say I never saw the original Let The Right One In so this review is just based on this movie. I thought this movie was well thought out. It's not your typical vampire movie which I liked. Granted it did involve killing but it had a great storyline which just added to the movie. This movie was more creepy and eerie than it was scary so be forewarned. I loved how they took a vampire movie and incorporated a love story. You do not see this very often which makes this movie a true gem. The two main characters (Abby and Owen) showed great chemistry together and they portrayed a great love story.    If you are looking for a fresh new vampire movie with a love story then look no further than Let Me In. You also get a little comic book as an added bonus!!
B00003CXA2|5.0|It's Forest Gump! What more do I need to say. If you have never seen it then you will want to. It is just a great \\"feel good\\" movie. Yes, it is all fiction and unrealistic but you get so wrapped up in it that you don't care.
B00006BIO0|3.0|We all know the problem with the quality of the earliest recordings of the Blues. Even the most ardent fan will have struggled with the extraneous noise that all but obliterates the recording on many of the surviving originals. Chalie Pattons work is wonderful but struggles to appear from the background mush. The recordings may have been remastered but would have benefited from better application of digital noise reduction techniques.<br />Having said that this set is good value for the money.
B003Y5H54W|4.0|2011's \\"Red Riding Hood\\" is a Grimm's fairy tale reset as a suspenseful monster saga for modern teenagers.  It features a good ensemble cast, atmospheric sets and music, and a love story wrapped around a murder mystery.<br /><br />The story opens in a medieval village, nestled in an almost mythical mountain landscape surrounded by dark snowy forests.  The village has been haunted for generations by a werewolf, who is held at bay by sacrifices of livestock.  A young woman named Valerie (Amanda Seyfried) faces a more pressing personal dilemma.  She is betrothed to the well-off but dull Henry, but holds her heart for poor but handsome chum Peter.<br /><br />The abrupt murder of Valerie's sister by the werewolf changes everything.  The villagers hunt the werewolf, and come back with a head.  To their sorrow, they will find they are mistaken, a fact pointed out by Father Solomon (Gary Oldman), a ruthless priest who hunts werewolves with a group of commando-like warriors.<br /><br />The plot cleverly hands out all kinds of clues and suspects; it would be a sharp-eyed viewer who picks out the killer in advance.  Valerie herself is a suspect, and faces some terrible choices on the way to a thrilling conclusion.  Recommended.
B00127RAJY|1.0|This might have been good if I had the patience and interest to sit through 5 minutes or so of advertisement and introduction EVERY SINGLE TIME you watch the video.  Usually, on most DVD's you can just hit 'menu' on your remote and go right to the 'Play' option, but not on this one!  You can't even fast-forward past the junk!  By the time you get to the menu to start the workout, you're irritated with the video AND with Jillian.  Because of this, I'll not likely be using this DVD again and will stick with my tried and trusted Tae-Bo Amped that allows me to get right down to business in the short amount of time I have to workout.  If every minute counts - don't buy this workout DVD.

B0000DCGT0|5.0|I have been looking for this movie for some time, and finally found it here.  The movie is exciting, moving, and a great story of determination.  If you recently enjoyed Secretariate, you will also enjoy Seabiscuit.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|This book is like the middle of many trilogy sandwich's...awkward and listless.  Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy it.  But it had equal parts excitement mixed with boredom. When I finished I distinctly remember groaning and mewling that I cant wait 4 more years for the next installment (it was 3am)!  So I will now begin to allow myself to forget the likes of Kvothe, Sim, Wil, Denna, Fella and the rest in an effort to make 4 more years go by all the quicker.  God speed Mr. Rothfuss....

The insights I have now from reading this and the books by Maria Emmerich have helped me change how I eat and I have started losing weight.  I highly recommend this book.  I am ordering another copy and giving it to my doctor, who had no answer for me when I threw my hands up in the air and wailed \\"But what CAN I eat?\\"....she has an open mind, I hope this will give her an answer for the next person that asks the question.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|Since I've been together with my fiance, I've been immersed in the wonderful world of zombies.  If there's anything zombie that's come out in the past couple of years we've seen it.  So it came as no surprise when one night he's like, we're going out, The Walking Dead is out on video now.  I of course was clueless and suppressed a small groan.  \\"Not another zombie movie!\\".  Nope, not another movie, this ones a tv series was his answer to me, his eyes lit up with glee.  Surprisingly, I was engrossed from the first episode.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS: (There may be spoilers!)<br /><br />This is a short series; only six episodes long at this time.  But there is a lot packed into those episodes.  We're given a little bit of intro in which we are introduced to Rick Grimes a deputy sheriff in a small town, who is shot in the line of duty despite his partner Shane's best efforts to keep him safe.  When Grimes next wakes up, he is in the hospital and no one is responding to his calls.  His machines are off, and the flowers left are dead.  He stumbles out into a scene of madness with the hospital ripped apart and dead bodies lying everywhere.  Stumbling around in his hospital gown he encounters some things a bit scarier though, as he leaves the hospital the whole area is destroyed and bodies are piled everywhere.  There's one that he sees while taking a bike that looks demolished, but then it starts moving.  Still disoriented from waking up in the hospital after being in that long coma he continues home to see what has happened to his wife Lori and son Carl.<br /><br />Defeated after finding the house empty, he stops to rest and doesn't really pay attention to the strange moving man coming up the street towards him.  But then two more people come on the scene and brutally murder the man in front of him.  Still weak and having been hit by one of them, he passes out only to awaken later being cared for by a man and his son.  They explain what has been going on in the world since he's been in a coma.  They explain all about the Walkers, and how to destroy them.  Later, he leaves and sets out for Atlanta, hoping to find his family and some safe refuge.  Atlanta isn't what he expects though.  Thinking he has met his end he is rescued at the last minute by a foraging group in the city.  They are part of a group camped outside the city and are just trying to survive.  Now, with all odds against them they have to make it out of the city and back to everyone else, but even after that, what are they going to do in a world taken over by the walking dead?<br /><br />CHARACTERS:<br />Andrew Lincoln as Rick Grimes<br />Jon Bernthal as Shane Walsh<br />Sarah Wayne Callies as Lori Grimes<br />Laurie Holden as Andrea<br />Jeffrey DeMunn as Dale Horwath<br />Steven Yeun as Glenn<br />Chandler Riggs as Carl Grimes<br />Emma Bell as Amy<br />Viviana Chavez as Miranda<br />Noah Emmerich as Dr. Edwin Jenner<br />Madison Lintz as Sophia<br />Maddie Lomax as Eliza<br />Noah Lomax as Louis<br />Melissa McBride as Carol<br />Adam Minarovich as Ed<br />Juan Pareja as Morales<br />Jeryl Prescott Sales as Jacqui<br />Norman Reedus as Daryl Dixon<br />Michael Rooker as Merle Dixon<br />Andrew Rothenberg as Jim<br />IronE Singleton as T-Dog<br /><br />I'd never really seen any of these actors in anything before, but I think they all did a magnificent job.  Fear is prevalent throughout the movie and all were able to express that very well.  Rick as a character was somewhat unbelievable at times and had an uncanny knack for surviving.  But I suppose that's what makes the story.  I think his wife is a raging jerk and very finicky and I'm not fond of her at all.  Everyone else is pretty interesting and its a good mix up to do the story.<br /><br />All the effects were remarkably done.  Everything was very lifelike and the zombies both creeped me out, grossed me out, and amazed me all at the same time.  It was even scary in certain moments.  Some of the imagery was incredible.The picture shown on the cover of the dvd set is of Rick riding a horse down an empty road into Atlanta.  This is a real scene from the movie and it was very powerful.  Most of them are in fact.  But they are also very brutal.  There is a lot of gore and violence in this movie and it can be stomach turning.  If you can't even handle a little bit of blood, this series is not for you.<br /><br />I can't wait for the second season to come out.  There is a lot of unfinished business and it will be a long time before fall.  I want to know what happens, six episodes just wasn't enough.  There are too many things left unexplained.  I guess until then I'll just to find something else to occupy my time but it'll be tough.  What a great show!<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011om the movie and it was very powerful.

B00000FC5H|4.0|Lots of the good and some of the...unknown?! Now, I'm not like this huge Earth, Wind and Fire fan, but I was completely and totally unfamiliar with about a quarter of this CD, and have to admit that what I didn't know, I didn't like, although I listen to it quite a bit.          My favorite two EWF songs are Fantasy and Serpentine Fire,, both of which are here. There's quite a generous helping of disco type songs, such as Sing A Song and Boogie Wonderland. my understanding is that EWF were more of a jazz inflected funk band before really hitting it big, so I'm thinking that fans of earlier stuff might NOT enjoy this CD.           Then again, I could be totally wrong! It's been known to happen before!!
B00004ZELJ|5.0|I love this video, it one of my favorites!!! I am a fan of the guys since they start it, and seeing them singing all their amazing song its just so cool. I love also the solos when Howie and Kevin sing!!!!  This must be in your collection!! Its for every BSB FAN. Its good to remember the songs, they are amazing. You look at this DVD and they look so young!! I love BSB:)
B00430EQK8|4.0|Let me first say that since you can get this item delivered for less than $10, it is worth every penny.  The lossless sound track certainly sounds great on a surround sound system.  What I heard of the singing was beautiful and the details of the orchestration came out better than on other Ring recordings I have heard.  According to a reviewer of the full Ring set, left and right channels are sometimes interchanged but I had no idea of that from the excerpts.  The visual element was abstract art of geometrical, kaleidoscopic shapes, with little connection with traditional Ring imagery.  There is no scenery but several projection screens at various places on the stage, giving the video creator, Franc Aleu, the opportunity to exercise his imagination in cooking up 3D action.  Unfortunately I was watching in 2D and the effects were pretty much lost.  I will wait to see if they are releasing a 3D version before deciding whether to buy the complete set.
0060987464|1.0|After reading some of the reviews on amazon, I decided, \\"why not? I'll give this book a try!\\"  I've never listened to Marilyn Manson's music, nor am I really a fan of him or his genre of music, but he's an interesting character and I can respect that.     This book was such a let down. One, for all of the people who are praising Manson as some kind of great author, let me remind you, this guy CO-WROTE this book (i.e. he had a professional writer essentially write the whole thing for him).  He actually got Neil Strauss, the man behind the popular dating book \\"The Game.\\"  Also, it really doesn't take that much talent to write a \\"unique\\" and \\"twisted\\" memoir about someone like Manson -all you have to do is throw in some big words and \\"crazy\\" stories that involve hookers and cocaine.  There's nothing wrong with interesting stories about sex, drugs, and rock and roll, but it just seemed like he was name dropping tons of drugs and people the entire time. COOL, congrats that you took tons of cocaine and that you worked with Trent Reznor... WE GET IT, YOU'RE EDGY AND DIFFERENT. Ugh, the entire time I felt like he was just bragging and trying to seem really cool, which is interesting because he spends much of the first half of the book complaining how he was never accepted and how he was never, and will never be, \\"cool\\" in the way mainstream is. Honestly, half way through I wanted to be like \\"STOP COMPLAINING YOU ARE RICH NOW\\"     This book is just him whining, it is NOT interesting at all. DO NOT BUY IT.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I began this somewhat skeptical but was drawn in through the descriptive details of the location settings in many countries,  the characters and their relationships as they were developed. Way outside the lines of my imagination the well thought out plot and obvious research to incorporate historical publications referenced throughout was thought provoking. I turned the last page disappointed to see it was the last page and feeling like I read it all too quickly because now I would have to wait too long for the next book!   If you enjoy this genre I know you will like this book, if you generally do not or are skeptical, try it you too will probably thoroughly enjoy it as I did!!
B0038W0OHQ|5.0|When it comes to gaming and especially gaming competitively, being able to hear your opponents with ease and as limited amount of distractions as possible is of the utmost importance. Being a pro gamer I've used various headphones which have noise reduction, those which don't, those which are unbearably heavy, those that are just right, and of course those which for some reason can't get loud enough, or on the other hand since there's no noise reduction have to have them so loud that they hurt my ears.        For example I used to use the Steelseries Siberia Full-size headset, which for at home use are great. Very comfortable on the head, had a very usable mic which came with it and the sound quality as far as detecting in game sounds to pin-point accuracy couldn't really get any better. The only problem was when I went to tournaments where it is extremely loud since it's more than likely at some sort of convention, the headphones were open headphones. They had no real noise reduction at all. So despite the sound quality being great, it would be washed over by the all consuming background noises of my surroundings. This in turn made it very difficult to play at the level I needed to play to win tournaments.        Thankfully Steelseries noted this and realized they needed to come up with something that eliminated this problem. The result is the 7h headset. I've been using them for just over a year now and it sure has given me a much easier time when I go to tournaments with it's great noise reduction qualities. The sound quality as well is still pretty much the same as the Sibera's that I had used which is exactly what I was looking for. They're very portable being able to dismantle the headset into a couple of pieces to reduce the chance of breaking them during travel. The weight of the headset was a little bit more than what I was used to but it took barely any time at all to become acclimated. Also the built in mic works great for me, I really like the fact that I can just pull out the small mic, it's not bulky it's just the right size and very flexible. It was always a pain to either have to clip on a mic to my shirt or to use one and find space somewhere on the desk. The cord length as well is a very nice feature which allows you to have more options when having your pc setup just the way you like it.        I really dunno where I'd be without these headphones. The various tournaments I've won over the past year might not have happened had I not had these at my disposal. Can't really say enough as to how much an improvement these are over the Siberia when it comes to playing at competitive tournaments.

B0043RT8JU|4.0|John Green achieves the impossible yet again when he combines a love story, a road trip, and high school without making the book a cliche. It might be difficult to believe, but trust me, you haven't read a book like this before. Quentin Jacobson and Margo Roth Spiegelman are next-door neighbors and childhood best friends. As the years go on, they grow apart- until one night when Margo appears in his bedroom and takes him on an adventure the likes of which the world has never seen. Quentin starts to hope that maybe, just maybe, Margo has a place for him in her life.    The next day, she is gone. The rest of the world thinks that this is just one of Margo's crazy stunts. Her parents go so far as to change the locks to keep her out of the house. Quentin, however, knows better. There's something going on with Margo, and A string of clues are left for him to decipher. But as the trail grows longer and colder, he isn't so sure if he wants to know what's waiting at the end for him to find. John Green has created a remarkably honest and witty book yet again, that echos softly of Looking For Alaska while still weaving its own tale of teenage angst. However, sometimes it's difficult not to wish for Alaska's wisdom when becoming fed up with Margo's enraging antics.    The wonderful thing about Green is that his characters never come to these big realizations that change the course of their lives in a way that makes them live as better people. Instead, they understand a little bit more than they did before, and that is enough. The epiphanies are not all-encompassing. What teenager has ever had that kind of knowledge become clear to them? It is this that makes Green's writing so relatable to teenagers. Green doesn't just understand us- he doesn't try to change us.
055358894X|3.0|I'll start by saying this book is really more of a 3.5/5 for me.  4 seems slightly too high but 3 seems too low for how much I enjoyed it.  It wasn't masterfully written, the characters aren't incredibly complex, and the story definitely had it's small flaws BUT I really had fun reading it.  It was definitely enjoyable and that has to be worth something when you're reviewing literature right?    I guess in general it was slightly more juvenile writing than I normally read but I would still recommend this.
0439023521|5.0|I don't usually read these kinds of books (fantasy, sci-fi, suspense) but I had to read The Hunger Games with all of the hype! I am a preservice teacher and this series is so popular with young adults and I can see why. I won't give anything away, but the books are simply brilliant. They are painful to read and truly heartbreaking, but so worth it! The series shows the effects of war on a people and the true cost of freedom.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I think this series did a great job of tying three very loosely associated accounts into one story.  A story of one company throughout the war like \\"Band of Brothers\\" was possible because Easy Company had a great and respected leader around whom everyone else rallied in wartime and for the rest of their lives.    Andy Haldane was cut from the same cloth as Dick Winters.  If he had lived to be a lifetime rallying point like Winters, the same kind of unified story could have been told about K/3/5.

B000HW2III|3.0|MASTER AND COMMANDER (2003) works best in its depiction of the relationship between a beloved ship's captain (Russell Crowe) and his crew. A dinner scene is particularly engaging, as are the cultured moments of violin and cello duets. Manueverings off the coast of South America between frigate HMS Surprise and the more formidible French vessel the Acheron are also most interesting.<br /><br />This film is a letdown however in the all-important boarding and hand-to-hand battle sequence. Shot with the shakiest of handheld cameras, it's absolutely impossible to follow what's going on, practically until the skirmish's outcome is decided. If the intention here was to baffle the viewer, this film's creators succeeded in my case. Yet, being served home movie quality smeary action after eagerly anticipating a thrilling swashbuckler of cutlass, dirk and bludgeon is just very unsatisfying to this sea adventure fan.<br /><br />In all other regards, \\"M & C: The Far Side Of The World\\" is a fine motion picture.

It makes her long drives so much better and she says she is now a CD (rather than radio) fan.  I only hope the other Austen novels come out as CDs soon...rather than cassettes.
B003UESJEM|1.0|This movie made me mad at the people who made it. It is about rich white men who get laid off from their highpowered jobs and suddenly have to come into contact with real life. What happens is so silly and so offensive to peolpe who have real problems that I have stayed made at it for months and whenever I hear anyone mention it, I steam. Ben Affleck's character can't make payments on his porsche or pay his golf club fees. Crisis! Chris Cooper's character might not be able to pay his daughter's tuition at Brown. He commits suicide! In a scene straight out of the Andy Griffith Show, Ben Affleck's son returns the XBox he got for Christmas to the store because he knows his dad can't afford it. This is what finally sends Affleck to take a blue collar job helping his brother-in-law Costner build houses. Even funnier, Affleck's wife works as a nurse so is making at least something.    This movie feels like it was made by rich people who were barely affected by the recession and decided to make a tearjerker about their pain. Affleck's only problem is his pride as a job is waiting right there for him. Do you know how many people in my own town would kill for that job? How many in my father's town? These men don't consider selling off their homes or cars as they are so married to their symbols of wealth and power that the one man who loses everything does it to run away with his mistress who was only into him for his status symbols. Lesson! If this had been a vicious, biting satire, I could have stomached it as it is hilarious to watch these self-important idiots flounder, but by the end they're right back on top.     I would love to drive to the director's house and suggest he show this movie to places around the country where people have real pain and real issues beyond having to sell a porsche or take a job involving physical labor. I'm sure he wouldn't care as he has written his thesis here.
0143038419|1.0|I mistakenly picked up this book thinking it was one woman's lighthearted travelogue. I was disappointed to find out 1. that the author only traveled because she received an advance to write the book in the first place 2. there was barely any information regarding the places she traveled too, 3. that 99% of the book is about her and basically her search for the meaning of life after her divorce . I found the author to be self absorbed and because the story evolved only with the help of the author's book advance, I wonder how much of it really happened (characters, moments) and how much the author made up when she found out she didn't have much of a story.    The book is divided into 3 sections 1. Italy (the Eat part) 2. India (the Pray part) 3. Indonesia (the love part). The Italy section started off ok but you can sense that it is about to go downhill. The India (Pray) section found me having to physically hold my eyes open to continue reading (hey I paid for the book so I can going to finish it!). It was over- the- top and filled with the author's self absorbed whining and theological mumblings.     Now, don't get me wrong, I'm  sympathetic to the author's misfortune. Divorce is not easy. But I found that in the book, the author was overly dramatic and her days and nights for an entire year were spent praying to God to get her out of her depression without doing anything to better her own situation except running away from her problems. It was VERY hard for me to see how she could be so depressed about her life when she had a thriving writing career, freedom to travel, and a wonderful support system.It was hard to get through because it was so boring and I just couldn't grasp why she would publish this self involved mess.     By the time we get to the \\"love\\" section in Indonesia, I was so disengaged from the story I found myself just in a rush to get through it. Instead of whining and praying for 10 hours a day, she could have put her time into meaningful charities in these countries she visited and took action to make the world a better place. In my opinion, it was a year of her life she wasted being selfish.     Elizabeth, save the whining for your diary next time. God is wonderful and gracious but only you can change your life.
0316017922|5.0|This book had me from the hockey tournament onwards.  I wasn't expecting much when I picked it up but it blew me away.
6304696515|5.0|This adaptation of the novel \\"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\\" which is based on a play adapted from the novel (like the 1931 film version of \\"Dracula\\") is really very good. Glenn Close and John Malkovich are excellent as former lovers who scheme to destroy the lives of others. The writing is very sharp, and witty. Michelle Pfeiffer is also quite good, as are Uma Thurman (long before she set out to \\"Kill Bill\\"), Keanu Reeves (in a very small role) and Swoosie Kurtz. I recommend this film only for a one-time viewing, though; two or three at most. Unless absolutley required by the storyline (ie. \\"Schindler's List\\" or \\"Excalibur,\\") I see no need for nudity in a movie, especially in a period piece. Heed the R rating SERIOUSLY.<br /><br />I really like the classical music used in the movie.
B000H4QD1O|3.0|This could have been a great show, and probably run for many seasons. It has great characters and conflict, and the story world is compelling: A band of people surviving by taking mostly-illegal work, and staying on the fringes of civilization to avoid authorities.    The glaring fatal flaw can be seen right in the (original) pilot episode: The Serenity crew are going to meet someone (Patience) to make a deal, so they fly several light-years, park their space-ship, WALK through a desert for several miles, the other group shows up on HORSEBACK, and an old-west shootout ensues. Utterly ridiculous. This scene should have been two ships docking in orbit, or sneaking into some futuristic \\"neutral territory\\" to work the deal. The injection of actual old-west settings makes no sense (horses, sweat-stained bandanas, bandoliers draped across the chest, revolver-looking guns, sacks of coins being tossed back and forth). If the writers wanted the \\"frontier spirit,\\" they could have shown this in futuristic settings. In fact, they already did for the first hour of the pilot, and it was going fine.    I couldn't even watch the second episode more than 10 minutes. It's an old-west train robbery, but on a high-speed train. Ugh. More recycled Western stuff? I had to turn it off. And I was actually liking the characters at that point. They're fairly original, and played off each other very well.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I recently pulled this cd out and dusted it off and played it cuz it needed to b played.  I like most of the songs, my faves are American Life, Nobody Knows Me (the best song on the cd), Mother and Father, and Nothing Fails, although I don't like the choir part at the end, it's just too dramatic and reminds me too much of Like A Prayer.  The only song I don't care for is Easy Ride.  Madonna has an uncanny knack for putting the worst song on the cd, last.  This album has insightful lyrics and good dance beats.  It's on of my favourites by Madonna.
B000JBWWBK|5.0|This was one of the most charming movies & Russell Crowe was at his best! Beautiful scenery, very romantic movie & a heartfelt message. The soundtrack is equally wonderful. All of the actors were fabulous! Nice to see a lovely movie for a change.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Don't pick up this book unless you have the time to read it all, as you will not put it down until you have read the last page. Ms. Harkness has written a first class book. The novel is well written, well researched, and well worth the price. The story centers around a witch in denial of her talent and the vampire that loves her. But it is so much more complex than that. I do not want to give anything away and you can read the summary of the story on the covers. It does transsend book genres, so don't think you are in for another vampire book or sci-fi, or romance. It is juat a really good read. You will be hooked from page one. Can't wait till her next one.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|i read this book in 12 hours! reading and seeing through the eyes of a child was so incredibly moving. thank you
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This CPU cooler is really big. In my Antec 900 case, there is no way I can connect an optional fan if I need to as this almost touches the top cover. But having said that, it is very reasonably priced and cools really well. The instructions provided are not all that great, but you can check youtube videos on installation instructions and then the installation is a breeze. In all it is a very good CPU cooler and I would highly recommend it.
B00486070K|4.0|One of the offices I work in does not have WiFi. I work for the government and we're not allowed to have an unsecure WiFi router. I tried bringing in my own router and they shut off my port in a couple of days. So, I need a wired connection at times. This little dongle does the trick. I plugged it in. It worked in seconds. After a bit of use, it does get slightly warm to the touch. I figured since it gets warm with the Macbook on sleep, that it must be eating up the battery, but I couldn't see a significant difference in the battery percentage. Obviously, the heat comes from somewhere so it consumes some power, though not enough to worry about.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|The intent and only reason for a re-master should be to gain an even better clone of the original recording.  Unfortunately in the MP3 age what we often see are not better reproductions, but altered recordings that are really nothing more than marketing schemes.  Most of these new re-mastering projects are an attempt to revive a dying record industry.  What UMG has done to The Stones catalogue is the same thing that radio stations do to broadcast music: they have compressed the audio so that everything leaps out at you with the illusion of a \\"crisper, cleaner, better\\" sound.  Don't fall for it.  If you really want to be ambitious, get a cheap or free editing program with a waveform display and compare the visual maps of the UMG masters with Bob Ludwig's 1994 Virgin masters.  The peaks and valleys of Ludwig's are SUPPOSED to be there.  A single flat display of audio is not good as it means little dynamic range (due to compression), and good dynamic range is the key to a good master.  A good master preserves the high and low levels of the original audio, while at the same time displaying an even and controlled range so the album is uniform and consistent.      The UMG masters will be just fine for the white earbuds as you'll definitely hear every detail.  However, if you want to stay true to the original, your good home audio system will sound much better playing back Ludwig's masters.  He's the best in the business, and what he did in 1994 is probably the best we'll ever get outside of having the original tape with the original machine it was recorded on.      That being said, Exile itself receives 5 stars as my personal submission for the greatest album ever made. The complexity and genius of the entire piece has never been matched.  As for the new songs, buy the disc from Target that contains the additions only and keep your old Virgin re-master of Exile...or find a used one on Amazon before they disappear forever.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this book.  So well written, great story, a real page turner.  I couldn't put it down!
B004498KPU|5.0|As I am one of Michael's many many fans Visions was the ultimate subject for my evergrowing Michael Jackson collection.  It's cover alone has prompted many who have just looked at it to order for themselves. I couldn't be more satisfied with this purchase. AND...whoever knows me better purchase it, because you can't borrow mines.  That would be too RISKY!!!
0061353248|2.0|I thoroughly enjoy new takes on economics, so my expectations for this book were high. And while my familiarity with Dan Ariely is limited, he seems to have a solid reputation. Unfortunately, P.I. is based on a handful of small (often trivial) experiments; the subjects being students at Ariely's campus. There are no profound take-aways. As another reviewer noted, Ariely broadly extrapolates paltry data sets to include all people.    Luckily, I borrowed this book from the library, and did not purchase it.
B0012YYZYK|5.0|I watch this over and over it is mesmerizing the talent that this band had together. There will never be another like them. Each one brillant in their own way, however Plant & Page are incredible together like milk & honey. Best guitarist & singer to ever play rock & roll.
B002ZNJWI6|3.0|I am a fan of Alistair Reynolds. Pushing Ice deserved a 5 star rating, and it spanned billions of years. This book did not do as well in spanning 7 million years.  Reyonolds created some confusing perspectives since the first person POV was used interchangably among 2 of the protatgonists (clones) of Abigail, the seed personality.<br />The thread for Abigail, the originator of the journey across space and timne, was intervwoven throughput the book, but it did not feel that the struggles during Abigail's narrative were relevant to themain story.<br />What the story did expose was the fact that many families created these clone explorers to visit the galaxy and rendevous every 200k years. It respects the fact that there is no \\"faster than light\\" technology. These families of explorers were painted as a decadent lot, travelling dilletants. it seemed that their ability to create and invent took a back seat to the endless wandering. So in this sense it reprents a view of stagnation on a huger galactic scale. The reasons I rated this book a three, as opposed ot Pushing Ice which got a 5:<br />1- it was not uplifiting at all<br />2- the entire society seemed aimless<br /><br />In Pushing Ice the protagonists, as flawed as they were invigorated our species to explore the stars
1591843790|5.0|Guy Kawasaki, the Silicon Valley icon, Apple Evangelist, Venture Capitalist, and bestselling author has done it again with his latest book, Enchantment: The Art of Changing Hearts, Minds, and Actions. This time--and one would expect nothing less of Guy--he has reached further: an update of Aristotle.     Enchantment, as Guy interprets it, is today's form of persuasion, the classical art of rhetoric that Aristotle pioneered. As any modern persuader would, Guy does a full court press on all the contemporary tools available to push and pull messages: Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, blogs, emails, and websites, but Guy goes deeper; right back to Aristotle's basic principles: Pathos, Ethos, and Logos.     More than two millennia ago, the classical Greek philosopher prescribed these three key elements necessary to achieve persuasion. He defined Pathos as addressing the emotions of the audience; Ethos, as affirming the character of the speaker to convey the message; and Logos as evidence to support the message.     In 2011, Guy Kawasaki comes right out of the gate at a gallop with each his first three chapters a modern take on each of Aristotle's three elements. Chapter One, \\"Why Enchantment,\\" is Guy's version of Pathos. He recommends that, to address your audience properly, you should \\"imagine yourself as the person you want to enchant and ask the following questions:\\"         * What does this person want?      * Is the change worth the effort?     * Can I change?     Chapter Two, \\"How to Achieve Likability,\\" is Guy's version of Ethos. He recommends that, to be well-liked, you should:       * Make Crow's-Feet [Smile]      * Dress for a Tie [Be mindful of your attire and that of your audience]      * Perfect Your Handshake     * Use the Right Words     Chapter Three, \\"How to Achieve Trustworthiness,\\" is Guy's version of Logos, and is the gateway to--as well as the strength of--the rest of his book. Throughout, he provides many valuable recommendations on how to achieve enchantment and he does so with excellent illustrations in support of his recommendations. Following his own advice, Guy offers an array of case studies, articles, statistics, quotations, blogs, websites, anecdotes--even an Aesop fable--and books. In fact, to demonstrate his thoroughness in taking on Aristotle, Guy's bibliography lists 20 books about persuasion, among them Chip and Dan Heath's current bestseller Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard and Dale Carnegie's classic How to Win Friends and Influence People.     Aristotle on persuasion, the Heaths on switching, Carnegie on influencing, and Kawasaki on enchanting--nice company! Ever his own man, however, Guy also treats us to his own distinctive language to express his recommendations to achieve enchantment:       * \\"I use bull shitake as my go-to swear word.\\"      * \\"Practice your presentation until you're sick of it. Then practice it more.\\"      * \\"Suck up. A more politically correct way to say this is `Do your homework,' but the result is the same.\\"      * \\"Make it short simple and swallowable.\\"     And his closing words to his readers:       * \\"Be well, do good, and kick butt.\\"     Enchanting!
0446563048|2.0|I found this book to be very readable and a page-turner in the beginning. Then somewhere in the middle it grew exhausting to the point where I could not wait for Hsieh to stop talking about culture and the utopia which is Zappos. Also, the narratives from other employees and partners in the company did not add anything to the material for me and got more and more annoying and they distracted me from the text. Frankly, I skipped over a lot of those parts and subsequently this became a very fast read for me. I enjoy reading business literature such as this and there were many books in the past that I loved and would recommend. I might even recommend this book to some of my friends, because of its emphasis in culture. I agree that culture is everything if you want a company to last. Also, Hseih and I both agree that being humble is much more important that talent, because egoism can really break down communication and cause unnecessary disruptions when someone thinks they are better than the team. If you have ever had to deal with an egoist, you know what I mean. The things I do not like about this book include the transformation from a chronological lessons-learned/how-I-did it book to an inspirational book espousing leadership philosophies. I would have recommended to Hsieh as an editor that he should have selected a primary subject on this book and maybe have written another one to complement it that focused more on inspiring people. Overall, I it had some good qualities, but it was missing solid focus.

B000E1NWGO|5.0|Only recently did I discover the remastered Living Stereo SACD series of recordings and have been very pleasantly surprised by the outstanding audio quality. When SACD first came out Sony produced a series of two channel SACD recordings as reissues of older analog recordings with sometimes marginal results. I was concerned that these might fall into that same category and bought my first one with some degree of apprehension.<br /><br />I was truly delighted to discover a competently recorded performance enhanced by three-channel SACD sound. Whereas a number of the Living Stereo SACD series are three-channel some are also two-channel. My compliments to the recording engineers at RCA for their vision and professionalism!<br /><br />These performances were recorded in 1962 and 1963 using an Ampex 300-3 tape recorder using 1/2 inch tape running at either 15 ips or 30 ips (ips stands for inches per second). The piano sound on this SACD three-channel recording is some of the best recorded solo piano sound I have ever heard.<br /><br />My surround sound system was designed primarily for music reproduction and I have an extensive collection of SACD, and DVD-A recordings as well as a number of the newer recordings featuring DTS-HD Master Audio. By comparison with all of those the piano recordings contained on this disc compares favorably and is, in some respects, superior as played on my system.<br /><br />I read the review concerning tape hiss after I had listened to the SACD and could not recall noticing the tape hiss on my system. I went back and played the beginning of the disc and noticed if I placed my ear close to the speaker I could make out some hiss. It was not so loud as to interfere with my enjoyment of the music.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Arthur Rubinstein for many years and have a number of his recordings but I didn't have any of him performing Beethoven Sonatas. This disc shows off Rubinstein's masterful technique with power and drama. The dynamic range of the SACD format can be challenging to a system and the listener's ear. Setting the volume high enough to produce the softer sections at a realistic level can produce sound at much higher levels during the really loud sections.<br /><br />As a matter of curiosity I set the level at the beginning of the Moonlight Sonata at a level that sounded convincingly as if a 9 foot concert grand were placed at the front of the room. It didn't take too much imagination to visualize the piano there in the room with me.<br /><br />As the recording progressed I realized that the level of the music was getting pretty loud so I set up a sound pressure level meter and started checking the peak sound levels as the louder sections were being played. I was interested in noting the meter was frequently registering levels of 84 to 88 decibels and would on occasion pass the 90 decibel level at the loudest parts.<br /><br />I have read that the sound pressure level at a concert grand can reach 105 decibel peaks at the piano bench when the piano is played with great force.<br /><br />Please forgive my enthusiasm for the technical part of music reproduction; the results have been a surround music system which has provided many hours of enjoyment for me.<br /><br />The quality of the reproduction you will get in your home will be in direct proportion to the quality of your system, especially the ability of your system to reproduce multi-channel music. The newer uncompressed audio formats promise a bright future for music lovers; as frequently happens the audio engineers are going through a learning curve and the early results are a mixed bag. I'm hopeful that we'll soon be seeing these newer formats engineered and recorded up to the potential they offer.of the SACD format can be challenging to a system and the listener's ear.

0756603749|5.0|This is the second time I bought this book. The first one, after borrowed by fellow scouts, for 2 years, it lost somewhere in the Scout Den. I need one, then I bought one again. Fortunately, the book is still there. The book covered most of the knots used during camping. So it's very useful in the sense that the knot really work for the purpose of setting them.
0439023483|5.0|So many others have already reviewed this book that I doubt I could add anything new. Thus, I'll just say that The Hunger Games is fabulous. I couldn't put it down, and I bet you won't be able to either!

B004G5ZXVQ|5.0|Just one guy's opinion, for whatever it's worth--    REM is my favorite band and has been since I was first mesmerized by Chronic Town and Murmur. I like nearly all flavors of REM: slow, fast, hard, jangly, folky, country, melancholy, pretty, bubblegum, dirge, soulful, dark, angry, bitter, and electronic. The common thread for me is melody (and often harmony), and that's what keeps me coming back. Even their lesser albums have a handful of strong melodies/great songs.     After ten or so listens and counting, I think Collapse Into Now is a great album, easily among their best. I believe it will endure like Automatic For The People. I believe my throat hurts.   CIN has the majesty of Automatic For The People but with (arguably) more variety,   fun off-kilter melodies, some of the ebullience of Out Of Time, and some wonderful rockers.   It also has one of their most beautiful songs ever--the gorgeous Überlin. All this at the 30+ year mark. Wow.     Thanks for reading.
0375413405|5.0|Unlike others I write, this is a totally personal-perspective review.  I'm a vegetarian for personal reasons, married to an omnivore, friends with omnivores, and related to a family of omnivores.  All delightful people whom I love, especially the one I married.    I can cook great vegetarian dishes full of unexpected flavors.  But for my husband and friends especially, I'd like to cook meat.  Especially, I'd like to cook good meat, from animals that ate a healthy diet and lived a normal animal life.  Here's the problem with cooking meat as a veg: YOU CAN'T TELL HOW IT CAME OUT.  I'd try a recipe from Mark Bittman or Fannie Farmer, and it would come out dry, or bland.  Waste of expensive free-range organic chicken. The only thing that always came out right was one of my vegetarian creations with bacon on top, because you can't mess up bacon.    Enter Julia.  There have been a several triumphant meals with loud congratulations, followed by leftovers that mysteriously vanish overnight.  I appreciate that following the directions gets me the results I wanted, and I appreciate that I've learned a lot of techniques for vegetables as well as meat that I'd never learned in years of cooking.  The new motto around here is \\"what does Julia say?\\"    In Kitchen Confidential, Anthony Bourdain describes a series of pastry mishaps that were resolved with a recipe from Mastering the Art of French Cooking.  He sounds a bit shamefaced about it - maybe because the book is aimed so firmly towards being approachable for a home cook - but points out that Julia's recipes always work.  That pretty much sums it up.

B0014Z4OQG|3.0|To keep this brief for all, Cloverfield is indeed and entertaining film. The mystery used by Abrams along with the unorthodox storyline helped the story to become fascinating. The special effects were good and creating the illusion of confusion and panic using the video-cam focal point is a nice touch that you'll either love or hate.    The biggest problem I have with the film is the idea that a story like this needs a sequel and now that 2 years has passed without even talk of one, buiding up all this detailed backstory, clues and other data was meaningless without a sequel so what Abrams actually accomplished was a lot of smoke and no sizzle. Why invest so much time developing the storyline for an unknown moster when you plan to do nothing with it goes beyond logic. I hope to see a sequel one day although I'd advise Mr. Abrams to tie up all the loose ends with this next version because time on this plot and character has already run it's course and already are problematic. This movie in essence is the definition of \\"wasted effort\\" and it should have been more than it was. My guess is that they made the film and didn't make the desired income on the project and abandoned it. It definitely would be a fun rental but I wouldn't suggest buying it unless your a fan or see it on sale for less than it would cost to rent.

B0034G4ORM|3.0|Battle: LA is about what you would expect from a big action spectacle that wasn't quite good enough (at least to the money hungry studios) to make the summer movie season cut. In some ways it's even better than a handful of the supposed blockbusters of the last couple of years.<br /><br />From basically the start of the film we are thrown right into the action. Aliens have come to Earth and want our water. Wow, how original. There isn't much time for character development here, but Aaron Eckhart does the best with the limited material. Michelle Rodriguez is underused and given nothing more than a few cheesy lines.<br /><br />The CGI is far from jaw dropping, but it doesn't look too fake and the less is more approach serves it well. The aliens themselves are a little on the boring side, mainly because their weaponary and fighting styles are almost identical to our own. The shaky cam is once again overused. It would have worked in moderation in order to put the viewer inside the action, but it became increasingly annoying. The dialogue is eye rolling inducing in spots and the emotional parts were on the typical and sometimes corny side, but overall Battle: LA is worth checking out for it's realistic approach.<br /><br />I saw the terrible Skyline in late 2010, and it is even a more laughably bad Sci-Fi invasion movie when compared to this one. The Syfy channel also released their ultra so bad it's hilarious version, Battle: Los Angelos (can your title be any more similar?) this weekend. At least the latter of the two is intentionally horrid.
B000001FI7|5.0|This is the album that helped me discover a new mix of music!  \\"Roads\\" was the song that appeared in Tank Girl that pretty much launched Portishead for me!  This was back when you could only buy a whole album or a whole soundtrack.  Luckly I took a chance and have loved this album ever since!  I have had this album stolen at least twice before (though frankly I suspect more) and have loved to spend the money to have it once more.  Get this!  Digital or Media!
0743496736|3.0|Jodi Picoult is an excellent storyteller and I love the way she advances the story through different narrators.  This book, however, was not my favorite one of hers that I've read so far.  It is about high school kids who experience a Columbine type school shooting.  For me, it was just not her best.  I would recommend My Sister's Keeper and Plain Truth.
B0049GYXDG|5.0|I love picking up the classic Disney movies on blu ray and so far I haven't been disappointed. The care that has gone into the picture and sound quality is readily apparent and the blue ray absolutely blows away the DVD version. For any fan of Alice in Wonderland I highly recommend picking up this version and giving it a go, it's like you're watching it for the very first time.
B002ZG99A4|2.0|I don't have the best sound system, but it does have Dolby Digital but not DTS. Therefore, I cannot watch this movie in surround sound. I either have to watch it in French or listen to the commentary if I want any sound through my sound system. Otherwise, I'm stuck listening to the movie via the TV speakers (yuck) or I have to get the standard def DVD out to listen to it in 5.1.<br /><br />Not sure why they did this. I mean, come on. It IS Blu-Ray and you have 50 gbs of space on a dual-layer, so I cannot see it's because they were strapped for space. I love the movie, but the release on Blu-Ray is not very desirable. I may be in the minority of those that don't have DTS decoders, but come on! All the other movies I've gotten on Blu-Ray all have at least a 5.1 if not a 2.0 Dolby soundtrack.<br /><br />The movie gets at least four stars, but this release on Blu-Ray gets a 2 star for me.

B00005N6KG|5.0|Well, I've only had this a week.  I've had the same headphones from other sellers for years.  And this seller has the fastest service ever.  Got it in 2 days.  Will definitley buy from them again.  And a really low price, it's remarkable !    love these headphones, the sound quality is excellent and so lightweight, barely noticeable.    I wear it not over my head but in my ears and then hanging down toward my chin.
0670022411|5.0|I read the first chapter and was hooked.  This was FAR better than Twilight (which I guiltily read). I liked the science/history aspects of A Discovery of Witches. I appreciate that the author has suggested further reading in her Amazon notes.  I have read her recommended Bryan Sykes', The Seven Daughters of Eve: The Science That Reveals Our Genetic Ancestry and agree it is a great book and enjoyed it tremendously.  I'll try her Darwin suggestion next.     Discovery of Witches    1. Examines the prejudice between creatures and the vested interests of the power brokers to keep the prejudices alive    2. Entices the reader to explore history. I'm suddenly intrigued by the periods and literature mentioned in \\"Discovery\\"    3. Models male restraint    I would recommend this book for adults, adolescents and \\"want to be\\" witches.

B000068VHP|5.0|Not very often are Albums as perfect as this one is.  I have had this CD since it was first released!  It might be one of the few that I have purchades mutiple times!  As anyone who has had CDs stolen can testify, it is a pain to re-buy albums.  But I had no problems buying this one a total of (at least) three times!  The sound of eveyr song feels perfect.  The mood. Dolores O'Riordan, was an excelent addition to the band and can't imagine the band any other way!  Linger is still the heart melter and I imagine it will be played for ages to come!
0142000671|5.0|Due to its simplicity, it is almost easy to overlook John Steinbeck's \\"Of Mice and Men\\" as one of the premier works of American literature.  Yet calling it simplistic does great injustice to a story that so eloquently captures a time and a way of life, a story that drifts quickly into being and all too quickly ends.  Even though it is short, the impact of Steinbeck's novel lingers long after in the reader's conscience and heart.<br /><br />\\"Of Mice and Men\\" is the tale of two men, George Milton who dreams of owning his own place one day, and Lennie Smalls, the idiot with brute strength who sticks to George like glue.  Because George feels responsible for Lennie the two travel together in a time when most men would set out on their own.  Certainly George's life would be a lot easier if Lennie were not in tow, but that's the lot he's accepted, even after having to flee a town because a woman accused Lennie of rape.  From the very start both George and Lennie are leery of their new position and premonitions abound that disaster is constantly around the corner.  Steinbeck crafts a unique blend of characters, all of whom capture quintessentially the dialect of time and place, as George and Lennie's premonitions come to fruition, and heartbreaking decisions must be made.<br /><br />This short novel is difficult to put down and is easily read in very short time.  Steinbeck's writing is effortless and lyric, his chapters beginning with vivid sensory descriptions of place to set the scene before his characters enter to bring life to his words.  There is nothing forced in Steinbeck's novels, especially his California set pieces that help define regionalism and naturalism in American literature.  Many would crown Ernest Hemingway as \\"the\\" American author, but Steinbeck more rightfully holds that place, in my opinion.  While Hemingway did capture brilliantly the voice of the Lost Generation, Steinbeck achieved more to define America and American literature in his novels, as evidenced with this masterpiece.  It is one of the best works in American literature, one that can be read and reread and seem new each time.masterpiece.

0385523912|5.0|Most of us are aware of North Korea-that isolated nation that, along with Cuba, is the last vestige of \\"pure\\" communism in the world. We know that it's a pariah state and that its people are oppressed, starving, and brainwashed. And, of course, we all know about its eccentric and nuclear-obsessed leader, Kim-Jong il.    And yet we know almost nothing about the everyday lives of the citizens there. The few foreign tourists that are allowed to visit are strictly monitored and are shown a glittering facade with little basis in reality. They stay in empty hotels and are driven along unused roads. What is life *really* like there?    Barbara Demick's \\"Nothing to Envy\\" gives us an answer. Through the eyes of several North Korean defectors, we are introduced to this reclusive, Orwellian state. Starting with the childhood of many of the main characters' parents during and immediately after the Korean War, the book chronicles the relative prosperity of the 70s and 80s, the collapse of communism outside of North Korea from 1989-1991 (and thus aid from the Soviet Union), the disastorous famine that swept the country during the 1990s, the death of Kim-il Sung in 1994 (which all North Koreans defectors remember vividly), and the escape and resettlement of the main characters/interviewees during the late 1990s and early 2000s.    While it's difficult to tell how accurate most of this is, the eyewitness accounts match up consistently enough to give us a relatively clear portrait of the most secretive state on earth. \\"Nothing to Envy\\" is well written, a good read, and an invaluable source of information.
9889979942|5.0|A visually absorbing account of modern China that manages to reflect the effervescent dynamism of the emerging new superpower through the eyes and lens of a travelling photojournalist. Over 600-plus pages, Carter has successfully weaved together the titular `portrait' from a series of images ranging in subject from urban sprawl to bucolic serenity and seemingly everything in between; the one constant pervading this admittedly unwieldy volume being his unwavering focus on the faces and back stories that define a nation in the midst of rapid 21st-century development. This balance between poignant laments for the loss of an old China the West never really got to know and hubristic assertions of its now-imminent dominance is perfectly struck as Carter gets into the nooks, crannies and peepholes of a nation that, for now, still exists on the periphery of our cultural radar. Not for much longer.
B003UESJFG|5.0|I bought this movie because my GF wanted to watch it.  As the previews had failed to move me to see it in theaters, I felt i was taking a huge risk in buying a movie without having seen a minute of it.  I can gladly say that the movie was OUTSTANDING!  Buy it!  Invite friends over!  Play it for a party!  Aside from the movie bieng made NOT REALLY FOR KIDS, I loved it!  Can't imagine why it only made 148 million but I hope the BLU-RAY makes much more!
B004HGBUVG|5.0|I was a bit concerned that this new album would be like her last two albums, Little Honey and West, both of which I cannot recall the songs of, unlike Essence, WWT, Car Wheels and Sweet Old World. West and Little Honey left me cold, making me wonder if Lu was past it. What a surprise Blessed turned out to be.  Blessed really is a superb album, beautifully crafted from start to finish. Took me a couple of plays before I started to get into it. I immediately liked 'Seeing Black' and yet now, after playing the cd continuously for 5 days I feel the album sounds better with 'Seeing Black' removed, because it is such a loud and fast track, it doesn't really fit in. Maybe it would best be at the very end of the cd. I have played the cd a few times with this track removed and then you get to enjoy the beautiful instrument arrangements of the other tracks, and they ARE very skillfully arranged. I still like 'Seeing Black' but somehow it just doesn't belong with the other tracks.  Copenhagen is my favourite track, and that flows into 'Born to be Loved' and then you are suddenly woken by 'Seeing Black' charging in with blazing electric guitars, and then along comes 'Soldier's Sonmg' and you are back relaxed again.  A very fine album, definitely one to have in your collection of Lucinda Williams

630218021X|5.0|This over the top Tchaikovsky biopic is a feast for the eyes and ears. Based on the actual memoirs of Catherine Drinker Bowen it tells in highly exagerated terms the story of Tchaikovsky and his battle with his homosexuality.  Few movies mix music and visuals as well as this one does. Richard Chamberlain is a hunk of a Tchaikovsky-men or women would fall for him-and Glenda Jackson remains serenly calm as she spirals into madness until she finally realizes what she knew all along-\\"He never loved me!!\\"<br />The music of Tchaikovsky is adapted so perfectly to the film it is hard to imagine some of these scenes any other way. The train scene where Tchaikovsky is visually assaulted by a naked Glenda Jackson to the strains of the \\"Pathetique\\" and \\"Manfred\\" symphomies is a harrowing experience, as is the final sequence where Tchaikovsky is dragged from his bed to a scalding bath as a cure for his cholera.<br />But the real reason for my writing this review is this: WHY ISN'T THIS FILM ON DVD? This is one film that would certainly benefit from a widescreen presentation. I did see a widescreen presentation in television in Montreal, so somewhere one exists. Where is it?<br />Here's hoping that someone sees this and forwards it to the right people so we can get the copy of this film we deserve.

0756404738|2.0|.. only to get into it and realize that it doesn't go anywhere.     and let me say that I love Rothfuss, I've gone out to booksignings, read Name of the Wind several times, and read his blog regularly.     I ordered this book and it came in on my birthday, so stoked. And then after dinner and cake, I curled up ready to meet Kvothe again and wander into his world for what I imagined was going to be a glorious 1000+ page ride.     I put it down halfway through. And then forced myself, I can't believe I had to do that, to read/skim the rest. I want to try again but can't bring myself to do it yet. For a story with such wonderful characters, a first book with such a delightfully suspenseful story, one where I couldn't imagine the second book being anything but a whirlwind of words and spells and action for the rest of the tale..     The plot had no real suspense, the stories didn't seem to add up, and I'm left wondering what the big deal is with Kvothe anyway. Which is an UTTER travesty. He didn't seem to progress as a character, his trips abroad seemed like transparent plot cheats to get his trainings over with and I was left wondering what the point of that several hundred page jaunt was. Far too transparent. Seemed like the meat of the story, the Chandrian, all of the plot lines from book one, were just trivial items this time around, with so much time spent on experiences that Rothfuss did a poor job of convincing the reader were important to the overall story. I felt like my time had been wasted and wanted more plot that mattered instead of side stories.     So very disappointed. I will be reading the third book and maybe rereading the second book if I can pull through it, as I can't really believe that the story could be left in such a halfway, letdown of a place. But I had wanted better. Rothfuss is a great spinner of words, it just seems he was too happy to spin words and not enough time spent storytelling or building a satisfying plot this time around.
B004FGMV0W|3.0|I've never owned an Avril Lavigne album before, and after hearing \\"What The Hell\\" on the radio I got excited for her album. I went out on a limb and decided to buy it.<br /><br />Frankly I've never been a fan of Avril, not to say that negatively. But I never got into her music really. \\"What The Hell\\" was a song that I heard and loved it, it had a catchy pop chorus, cool vocals and a rock vibe. The song is refreshing compared to all the electro-dance pop that is plaguing the charts recently.<br /><br />That said, I don't really know what to classify Avril as. Is she punk? Is she pop? Is she rock?<br />But judging from the sound of \\"Goodbye Lullaby\\" alone, Avril is a pop-rock gal.<br /><br />The album itself is NOT upbeat as I thought it would be, judging from \\"What The Hell\\". It's definitely an emotional album filled with plenty of ballads and mid-tempo songs.<br /><br />My favorites are \\"Smile\\", \\"Push\\", \\"Remember When\\", and \\"Goodbye\\". \\"Smile\\" is the only other upbeat song on the album, and it's very catchy (seeing as it's produced by Max Martin & Shellback). The ballad \\"Goodbye\\" (written & produced solely by Avril) features Avril singing in a higher register, and it sounds beautiful. \\"Remember When\\" is another soaring ballad with beautiful vocals.<br /><br />Avril's voice is very pretty to me, but sometimes she stretches it too far. Her voice can get on the verge of nasally, which is when I'm about to cringe. But 90% of the time she stays in a healthy, beautiful singing range.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this CD to anyone who wants to rock out. This is an emotional, heartbroken album with a couple of upbeat songs thrown in for good measure. This CD gets boring sometimes, there is some unnecessary filler. But Avril's talent does shine through on this album.

1401324029|5.0|a huge improvement from the last book. more funny and \\"in character\\", just like seeing a very very long Castle episode.  worth every second.   Rook and Nikki went to places Castle and Becket can only dream at the moment.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great story with a happy ending and I had a hard time putting the book down.  Throughout the book I kept thinking that this could be any woman that you pass along the street so my heart went out to Katie's situation.  Great book!
1401310400|4.0|to all of you Castle fan, a perfect way to survive the lonely days without Castle in our life. not as good as Naked Heat but definitely worth the time.  too many inside jokes to count and we can only hope that Castle and Becket relationship will bare the same heat after they get together as Nikki and Rook share in this one.
0385533829|5.0|Born in Washington D.C. and growing up in the area, I have visited many of the historical buildings depicted in the book. I had previously read the Lost Symbol, but wanted the special illustrated edition to see the pictures and illustrations of our Nation's Capital. This edition made the reading more interesting and now that I no longer live in the Washington area, it's nice to have the book in order to view the areas where I played as a child and where I grew up.
0812977246|5.0|I have rarely wanted to award more than 5 stars for a book, but if any work of art merits such acclaim, then \\"Gorky Park\\" certainly does.  Please read this book to learn what excellent writing is all about: realistic and tragically heroic characters; minute details about the Soviet Union, its people, philosophies, dry humor and ways of coping; a plot that unravels like a Russian matryoshka doll; and excitement up to the very last pages.    This is my first Martin Cruz Smith Arkady Renko novel - I hope to read them all.    Enjoy!
0385513755|5.0|Beautiful book! Love the pictures and illustrations which enhance the reading experience of the story. I would recommend it to any Dan Brown fan.
B0045HCJ6M|4.0|I saw this movie in the theatre in the late 1960's.  I also saw Richard Harris perform it on stage in the 1980's, I think. The story is one of my favorites - the idealism of King Arthur, the land of nobility, the eternal triangle of Arthur, Guenevere, and Lancelot, and the music of Lerner and Loewe. I was pleased with the look and the sound of this video. The picture is bright, the colors are good. Certainly, I would recommend this to anyone who wants a positive spin on the story of King Arthur and the Round Table.
0312323867|4.0|After reading about Darcy in the first book, I was curious to read more about her. Though through alot of the book i kept wondering when is she finally going to London? When she finally gets there, thats where it really starts to get good. I just kept waiting and waiting for her and Ethan to hook up but the way it was handled was nicely done. I totally felt the sexual tension, especially when they would sleep together in bed but nothing else happen though it was obvious they both wanted it! Overall, slow start but totally worth reading.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I've heard about arctic silver 5 and i've heard many mixed cases. Lots of people have it drop 10 degrees celsius and some 2.

1400079144|1.0|I will never read another dan brown.  I agree with all the one star reviews, very repetitive, does not flow , just extended the end needlessly.  Lots of unbelievable parts, how langdon is cheated into coming to DC, how Katherine is tricked into allowing him to the lab and visiting at home.  How Langdon dies and he is not really dead, and still after Zach dies there are still 50 pages to a very boring and nonsense end !!
B002WYH5N2|5.0|Whatever, people. Yeah, you're gonna have one or two things that you don't like, but please! It's fantastic and Mr. Darcy...wow. It's wonderful. Excellent for girls who get into one of those moods. Ya know what I mean. Perfect!
