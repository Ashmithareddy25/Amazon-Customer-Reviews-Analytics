B003EYVXV4|3.0|Director Gary Ross's version of Suzanne Collins's HUNGER GAMES manages to sanitize the entire concept of kids-killing-kids in order to produce a PG-13 blockbuster that's sure to rake in the big bucks.  But what was devastating and heart-wrenching in the novel is glossed over and prettified here, leaving me feeling none of the emotional impact I experienced in reading the book.<br /><br />[**SPOILER WARNING**  I'm assuming readers are familiar with the novel, so some plot elements will be discussed in this review.]<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this is a slick and well-made film, with plenty of action and a sensational performance from Jennifer Lawrence as heroine Katniss Everdeen.  The settings are well done, especially the Capitol in all its crazy-colored chic-ness and over-the-top luxury.  District 12, the poorest district in Panem, is believably presented as well, complete with starving people dressed in rags and walking like zombies to their depressing jobs.  The scene of the \\"Reaping\\" is chillingly done, and the scenes of Katniss and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) getting primped and trained in the Capitol hit perfect satiric notes (it's all so \\"reality TV,\\" which is what makes it all so believable).<br /><br />What doesn't work are the scenes of the Games themselves.  From the start, Ross misses the mark.  When the Games are seconds from beginning, the 24 teens are standing in a semi-circle, staring down at weapons and backpacks strewn about around the Cornucopia as they wait for the countdown to hit zero.  We need to feel what they're feeling.  We need to feel their terror, their horror, and yes, even their excitement.  But Ross doesn't let us feel any of that.  Instead, he keeps the focus almost solely on Katniss, and once everyone starts rushing forward, he cuts so quickly between scenes that it's almost impossible to see what's going on.  We are aware that people are being killed, but it happens so fast and with so little reaction from the characters themselves, that it has little impact.<br /><br />The same holds true for the rest of the games.  Horrible things happen, but I never felt that they had much affect on Katniss or Peeta.  Most of the killing in the film happens off screen, or the camera cuts away before anything brutal is revealed.  That wouldn't be a bad thing if we could at least see some believable reaction shots.  But we don't.  On top of that, none of these characters look like they've been out in the woods for days, trying to kill each other.  Close-ups of hands show clean, manicured fingernails, and everyone looks amazingly dirt-free (aside from Peeta, who camouflages himself with mud at one point - but even then, he's clean and chipper-looking a few scenes later).<br /><br />Rue's climactic death scene is equally ridiculous.  Rue (Amandla Stenberg) looks downright gorgeous, like she's on her way to a photo shoot instead of swinging in trees to avoid getting knifed (in fact, we don't get to see her swinging in trees at all, just peeking out from between branches).  Her hair is perfect, there's not a scratch or bit of dirt on her, and when Katniss is holding her as she dies, it's impossible to imagine that they've been out in the woods for days without soap and water, fighting for their lives.  It's just all too pretty, all too nice.<br /><br />I walked out of the theater feeling oddly detached from what I'd just seen.  That's not at all the way I felt in reading the book.  The novel was gripping and gut-wrenching, and although it was certainly not graphically violent or bloody, the situation Katniss found herself in was chilling and horrifying and impossible to forget.  At the end of the film, however, Katness seems almost unscathed by what she has just experienced.  I didn't see any indication that she is the wounded, devastated young woman she is in the novel.  In the final scene, she's more bothered by seeing Gale (Liam Hemsworth) in the crowd at the train station while she's holding Peeta's hand.  Yikes, girl, you've just KILLED people and seen children covered in blood . . . surely you'd be thinking of something more than which guy you like better.<br /><br />There are changes in the film that might bother the die-hard fans.  The \\"Mutts\\" that attack during the final act are just generic beasts in the film (they don't have the faces of the fallen tributes), which minimizes their impact.  The symbolic Mockingjay pin just shows up near the start of the film without explanation.  But these are minor changes.  Stanley Tucci is great as Flickerman, Woody Harrelson is terrific as Haymitch, and I enjoyed seeing Donald Southerland as President Snow (although his performance was so low-key I had trouble imagining him as a ruthless dictator).<br /><br />This is a big movie, and it's going to be a huge success.  I have no doubt a huge percentage of HUNGER GAMES fans will be thrilled with what they see on the screen.  I just wanted to feel more.  The whole idea of being forced to kill people for a TV viewing audience is absolutely horrifying - I wanted to see that and feel that in this movie, the way I did in the novel.  You can't win a \\"game\\" like this.  Haymitch is proof that you can't win (what happens to his life after winning the Games is evidence of what such brutality will do to you).  In the novel, Katniss herself is torn apart by what happens.  In the film, not so much.<br /><br />HUNGER GAMES is not a terrible film.  I'm glad I saw it.  But it in no way does justice to the novel, and that's too bad.kes, girl, you've just KILLED people and seen children covered in blood . . . surely you'd be thinking of something more than which guy you like better.<br /><br />There are changes in the film that might bother the die-hard fans.

0312932081|5.0|Ender's Game is more than a sci-fi classic--it's a masterwork of fiction that not only is an enthralling read, but delivers a powerful, timeless message about morality and humanity.<br /><br />To summarize, Ender is a boy genius chosen to attend Battle School to train to help fight off an impending alien invasion. Ender isn't even a teenager yet but he's forced into the merciless environment of military training, and he will either adapt and survive, or fail and die.<br /><br />The characters in this story are unforgettable and the plot is structured beautifully, building tension and raising the stakes with every chapter, which makes it a real page turner. The book is about kids, but they are believably ingenious and far from simple-minded children--they are highly intelligent, but also naive, and very believable.<br /><br />If you even remotely enjoy sci-fi, then you should read this book. It won't disappoint. I also highly recommend [[ASIN:0441013597 Dune, 40th Anniversary Edition (Dune Chronicles, Book 1)]], which is probably the best sci-fi book I've ever read, and I suspect it will remain so for quite some time to come...
B00004TX5F|5.0|I've gone through two VHS versions of this, and was looking for a Blu-Ray version which I cannot find here. I will probably end up with the plain DVD, because this is one movie I watch over and over. Many have already summed up the story beautifully - I will only say that if you are a fan of opera, of Handel, of romance and tragedy and lush recreations of historical past - this film does not disappoint. I also have the Soundtrack from the movie. Yes, the music is lip-synched, but that does not detract from the beautiful tragedy of this very well-made film.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is hands down the greatest book I've read in several years.  It got me hooked at the start, and I couldn't put it down or shut up about how great it was for a long time after.  Exciting, visceral, though provoking, and extremely well written, destined to be labeled a masterpiece.
0307887898|5.0|This book is just awesome, it has changed the way I work and think. If you're looking to learn how to start a startup, you must read this. Most people think that having a successful idea is a dark art. This book takes a more scientific approach - quick cheap experimentation, knowing how to ask the right questions, and generally applying lean thinking.<br />It is relatively light reading and you don't need to read the whole thing if you don't want to. The first half of the book explains all the main ideas.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I was quite shocked about how this game would turn out, at first I figured: &quot;Well.....I'll give ot a go...&quot; but now that I did, I understand why Rovio put so much hard work on this game. This game however is no cakewalk. Now in space, with no real gravity, it does add more planning than just randomly shooting birds. Great puzzle game. Just one question, Y U NO BUY IT ALREADY?

B0078JOAOI|3.0|Season 2 had it's moments like the Shane/Otis incident, the Sophia incident, the Dale incident, the Rick/Shane incident and the outstanding freaking awesome finale with the appearance of Mishonne and the finale scene of the camera panning to show the prison BUT I thought the season as a whole was a little sluggish compared to the kick ass Season One.  I realize the shows producers were establishing characters and that's important to story telling so I'm not complaining.  TWD has to be the BEST television series ever.  It is gruesome, compelling, disgusting, gory, well written, character driven with a dose of wonderful zombies thrown in for good measure and who doesn't love zombies?  The blood and guts is pretty graphic at times (just remind yourself the zombies aren't really tearing away at human flesh, that's nylons they're chomping away at) so the series isn't for the feint of heart but if you're into heavy duty carnage and adrenaline fueled excitement, this series doesn't disappoint.  At the end of season 2 Rick has become glorious Ricktator and I'm pumped to see what direction he leads the group -- and what members of the group will follow.  I'm a huge fan of Glen so (not having followed the graphic novels) I'm hoping Glen sticks around.  Can't  wait for Season 3!!!
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|I'm one of the many that grew up watching the Muppets and was quite sad when they went off the air. This movie is one well packaged homage to the Muppet Show that I watched as a child. This movie made me laugh and cry because it was like watching the old Muppet Show. What a great way to introduce the current generation into the hilarity and slap-stick comedy that the Muppets do so well at. The music was also top notch. I can't think of a single song that was lacking. Go out and buy this movie!

B003K1EYM6|3.0|First Apple could have this function built into iPad itself. Most Android tablets do, they can put a SD card and a USB interface right on iPad. I don't think it will make the device less beautiful. Ability to connect a external harddisk for backups will be great. So is ability to copy music from hard disk onto iPad. This connection kit is the closest to getting that function.

1451648537|4.0|I'd looked forward to reading this book.  Once I started it, I realized it was going to be a bit of a chore.  The first half was pretty repetitive; Steve was mean, a jerk, eccentric, etc.  Just as I was going to give it up, Mr. Isaacson finally  hooked me at around the time Jobs took back control of Apple (1997).  From that point on, it was a compelling read.  He was still a jerk, but I finally understood what else he was--a perfectionist trying to make the best products on the market because he wanted them to be the best...not because they'd make him money.  I love my Apple products; they're reliable, easy to use, and nice to work with, unlike Microsoft products and the PCs they run on which are buggy, get viruses, and crash just when I'm finishing up a paper.  So now I know why Apple products are darn near perfect...because Steve Jobs said they should be.  Thanks, Mr. Jobs--and thank you, Mr. Isaacson for writing an honest biography about this complicated yet fascinating man.

0439023521|1.0|I have held out on reading this dystopian society book for nearly a year because I truly hated the premise of teenagers killing other teenagers (the series was lent to me by a friend). Since she and I are going to see the movie tomorrow afternoon (well, I was going to the see the movie--now I'm not too sure I'll go), I figured I'd better finally read the book.<br />  After finishing it, I am hard put to figure out why everyone (adults and teenagers alike) is so gaga over it.  The violent premise of teenagers blithely killing other teenagers without a qualm (okay, I'll admit, not all of them--but enough of them), or the fact that the world is embracing this book where adults in charge are encouraging and exploiting such behavior--I don't know what I hate the most.  Why do writers today think that a YA book has to be full of murder, mayhem, and violence (on the internet or in person) against each other?  Yeah, I know that the main character and her fellow District 12 'Tribute' have no stomach for the Hunger Games and are chosen unwillingly; however, there are other teenagers in different 'Districts' that train for the Games since their early childhood--and volunteer willingly.  Ergo, they kill willingly and without conscience.<br />  I'm disappointed in our culture...which preaches that bullying is wrong, passes laws mandating educators to 'control'  the propensity of some students to be mean and vicious to one another in schools, yet rave about books and TV shows (Glee comes to mind) that continually contain plots of said behavior being tolerated and or encouraged by the adults in charge.<br />  On a side note, I hated the stilted, sophomoric writing as well.  Oh well--I guess I should stop my rant and finally join the 'Old Ladies' club.  Obviously that's where I belong.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|this series is ok but with all the hype, it is ruining the series! its trying to live up twilight / harry potter when its totally different. the format is iffy since the font changes constantly, messing up bookmarks for specific pages. i havent seen themovie but with all the pics of the actors theyve over done it. i heard their gonna split mockingjay into 2 movies like hp 7 pt 1 and 2 (which twilight copied) very annoying!

More examples and metaphors could have been used.<br />*The notes at the end mostly explain interesting but complex neuroscience experiments. Nice.<br />*Definitely worth the money.

B002UM5BXW|5.0|This is the first book anyone who is intersted in food should read. Its a great read, I finished the whole thing in three days. My sister, who went to the CIA after Bourdain did and is a chef now turned me on to this book after I told her how much I liked this other book she recommended called Culinary School: Three Semesters of Life, Learning, and Loss of Blood which I loved. [[ASIN:B004XVZPBG Culinary School: Three Semesters of Life, Learning, and Loss of Blood]] is more about culinary school and is more recent than the Bourdain book, so read that if you want to know about shool, but if you want to know about Bourdain before No reservations than read this one. Or even read both if you want to know what culinary school was like twenty years ago in Kitchen Confidential and what it is like today in the Three Semesters book. Then you have to rent No Reservations if you are not already watching it!

B00008GKEG|4.0|Originally produced for television broadcast in 1995, THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY is a 10-episode, 11-hour documentary film covering the whole history of the Beatles from their childhood in 1950s Liverpool to their breakup in 1969. The three Beatles alive at the time -- Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr -- recount their memories to unheard and offscreen interviewers. John Lennon is represented by audio from the many interviews he made when he was alive. In addition, producer George Martin, assistant Neil Aspinall and press officer Derek Taylor are interviewed. There is abundant archive footage of concerts, television performances, promo videos and news appearances.<br /><br />This documentary assumes some basic prior knowledge of the Beatles; one should know the albums they put out and in what order, and vaguely what hit songs are on which. One should know that Stuart Sutcliffe and Pete Best were members of the band in the very early days. But that's it really, and with that basic awareness one can enjoy and learn a lot from THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY. For example, like many people, I suppose, my Beatles listening starts from RUBBER SOUL and their music before that album seems like the most vacuous pop. After watching the documentary, I can appreciate that early music as a heartfelt response to the American rock'n'roll that the four young lads were enchanted by.<br /><br />This is an entertaining documentary, but not everyone will like everything on it. Originally, the format was much more interview-centered, and you can see this in a \\"director's cut\\" bootleg that has long circulated. By the time it was broadcast, the documentary had been edited to include much more 1960s footage, with the members of the band often contributing only a line or two between long concert scenes. Therefore, those hoping for lots of facts and trivia may be disappointed, but as someone interested in 1960s fashion and youth culture, I find more footage of that era quite welcome.
B0062P332Y|5.0|I wish they would have used DiNero more but this was a stellar movie. Everybody played interesting characters and the pacing was spot on. Action from start to finish.
0451209338|4.0|For the first hundred pages or so, I didn't really like the book. But, I'm glad I stuck with it because, as the novel progressed, I liked it more and more and ended up quite enjoying it.<br /><br />I'm not 100% sure why I didn't warm up to the novel right away. It's not that the book wasn't well written because it is written well from the first page. I suspect two elements were at play:  first, Gabriel Allon is pretty hard to like. There are things about him you can admire, but he's a cold fish. For good reasons, he's a very emotionally closed person. While this makes sense for his character and history, it's not easy for the writer to become engaged with him. At least, for this reader.<br /><br />Second, the relationship between Allon and the boy, Peel, is directly lifted from \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\". I'm not calling Silva a pliagiarist -- sometimes things get stuck in an author's mind and come out without him/her realizing where the idea came from. Sometimes, things are genuinely cross-created. But, it was just frustrating for me because I have only read a slim handful of spy novels in my life and here was the same thing in two of them!<br /><br />Well, LeCarré is the best. If you're going to \\"borrow\\" tropes, you might as well do it from the best, I suppose.<br /><br />When Julian Isherwood and Jacqueline/Sarah came on the scene, things began to pick up. Then, things moved very fast and, of course, you had to find out how everything ended. Even though you know there's a whole series about Allon, you still feel real tension and fear for his situation. It's quite a feat for an author to make you feel the main characters are really in danger.<br /><br />There's a twist at the end of the book that some may not like, but I liked it and I thought it was completely in keeping with the characters it concerned.<br /><br />I can't yet say I'll read the whole series but I will at least move to the second book.

0375869026|5.0|As a sixth grade teacher, I struggle daily with the challenge of encouraging my students to sympathize and empathize with one another and show each other kindness. When I heard the NPR author interview with RJ Palacio, I knew I needed to read this book right away. I could not be more thrilled with my purchase, which I whole-heartedly intend to use in my classroom as soon as possible.<br /><br />As other reviewers have said, Wonder is chiefly about a boy named Auggie Pullman who has a cranio-facial abnormality. He's been home schooled up until fifth grade by his doting, if a bit overprotective, mother. Now he is starting school--but not just any school... middle school. You know--the number 1, most feared and reviled period of any person's life. Auggie encounters fear and bullying, but also kindness and friendship.<br /><br />The story is told from several different points of view, each which add to the richness of the book and create a three-dimensional view of what tween-dom is really like. We hear from Auggie, who is our hero but also the victim of cruelty and bullying. We hear from his sister who feels abandoned by her mother and friends as well as resentment toward her needy brother. There is the voice of the child who does the \\"right\\" thing when witnessing how cruel the other kids are. Then we hear the point of view of the kid who stood idly by and even partook in the bullying so that he wouldn't be ostracized. Each character's experience rang true to me and as I was reading I was actually thinking about individual students of mine who might connect with each character.<br /><br />The real draw of the story is that it is masterfully written and totally engaging. It is funny at times, but I also cried at least twice while reading. I read the entire book in one sitting. Palacio does a great job of building the characters in the book and making you care about them. It isn't preachy, though the moral is very clear right from the start. Occasionally the mother character read to me as being a little heavy-handed in doling out \\"the right thing to do,\\" but that is certainly not a criticism worth throwing the book out over. This is also a book that is written in a style that would be easy enough for upper elementary school to read, but has content that is engaging for middle school students. I was certainly engaged and (this is my super secret) I don't really like most \\"middle school\\" books.<br /><br />If there is a drawback to this book it might be the \\"geek culture\\" references, which are very topical. The Star Wars talk might be here to stay, but references to specific video games and some of the kid slang ground this book to a very specific time period. Mad props for the Magnetic Field and Polyphonic Spree references, which I imagine are more there for the adults reading than the kids. I also recognize that this is a book about a pretty specific group of kids--private schooled, New Yorkers-- which might seem to be from another world to my rural students.<br /><br />Still, I can not think of a single one of my sixth graders who would not benefit from reading this book. I see so many connection to my students lives through the characters of Auggie, Via, Jack, Summer, Miranda, Justin and the rest of the group. There's enough humor and pathos that I think that most of my students would enjoy this book. I'm going to have to wait until it's in paperback to get a class set, but I am going to HIGHLY recommend it to them.cter read to me as being a little heavy-handed in doling out \\"the right thing to do,\\" but that is certainly not a criticism worth throwing the book out over.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I won't go into detail about the lack of character development or any real plot, many other people have written about that and done it in detail. I wish I had known this was Twilight fan-fic before I bought it because in reality I would not have bought it. The plot is almost non existant, the writing boring and somewhat juvenile. The characters were all over the place in terms of personality (do you want the romance hero, the lost boy, or the adult male? PICK ONE PLEASE!)and overall it just isn't interesting.<br /><br />I'm mad at myself for paying for it and more than that, mad that it was $10 because it certainly wasn't worth it. Wish Amazon had a digital return policy.
0545101417|4.0|This is a very entertaining book.  It follows on Susan Collins' first book and picks up right where the first book left off.  It is as much fun the first book, The Hunger Games.  I had the audio version and listened to it during a 15 hour drive.  It kept me interested for the entire drive.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|It's an oldie, but goodie.  A favorite of mine.  Never grow old.  Can't go wrong with this one. A must have in any video library. All the actors are superb.
B005G4TJUC|4.0|Great film only downside is that Megan Fox was taken out of the picture with a bit of a lame explanation for it.
B0067Q04AM|5.0|Favorite album of 2012 so far. Eclectic, dense, soulful, and full of memorable melodies in a way that most jazz records are not. Highly recommended for fans of jazz, neo soul, and great music in general.
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|Loved this book, I couldn't put it down. Went to work with many sleepless nights. Got a few friends to read it as well, we all can't stop talking about this trilogy.........
0132350882|4.0|Hello everyone,<br /><br />first a short introduction: Although I have been programming for many years, I never did any professional work. I'm just starting out as a software engineer now and the company hiring me gave me this book right after the job interview.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It doesn't fail to teach you the importance of its message, although, especially in the beginning, it is very repetitive, which made me a little bit annoyed at some times. I enjoyed the first few chapters the most and I think that both beginners like me and professionals can benefit from it.<br /><br />After that, there are a few quite technical chapters which I had problems with, even more so because Java has never been my favorite language. I don't criticize the authors' choice with Java, though, since they had to pick some language and using more than one would just be confusing. Also I can't share many people's concerns of too much code. I'd rather skip a page than having to look in the appendix all the time.<br /><br />Some case studies are following these chapters and although containing endless lines of code, I really did enjoy seeing how a professional refactors code. I did not read them in detal and skimmed it on some parts, but even then I could learn a lot. I'll definitely read over these chapters again, but that time in detail.<br /><br />To summarize it, the book is quite repetitive at parts, but definitely teaches you very valuable things in detail. I can absolutely recommend it.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|It was fun.  Both my mother and I enjoyed it greatly.<br /><br />True to the original text, it is strong on action and lavish spectacle, but lacking in character development and meaning.  The action is very well paced and choreographed, and this is a rarity in CGI action films in not having the individual fighting sequences drag on overly long.  The plot has some complexity (evidently too much for many reviewers) that serves well to move the events along.  There is little moral complexity, with the characters being either good or evil in the manner typical of action films.  The acting is generally good (if not particularly demanding), and the leads are suitably pretty.<br /><br />The CGI effects do a great job of bringing the creatures and technology of ERB's work to life, and the animated characters hold their own quite well compared to the live actors.  The technology features some great steampunk-style designs, particularly in the flying craft.  The one place where the CGI effects seem to miss is on the landscapes, which are beutifully sculpted but appear to place the action on some yellowish-tan desert planet that looks more like Tattoine or Geonosis than on Mars.  Likely making the red planet red would have badly affected the visual appeal, a problem that ERB did not have to face in the written text.<br /><br />Cliches abound, but it should be noted that some of these may have originated with the text and enjoyed greater novelty last century.  Some of the less plausible elements (anti-gravity wood, technology-free teleportation, reproduction between oviparous and viviparous creatures, etc.) have been removed.<br /><br />Those looking for substance or thoughtfulness would do well to look elsewhere.  Those looking for a visually appealing feast of planetary romance should be well served.

B002R5QPRI|4.0|Great movie good streaming<br />Will look forward to renting another video from here. Just don't play so good on cell phone
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|This movie was nonsensical, random, and downright strange. It had no parts that resonated, the singing hurt my ears, and the shrimp thing was just odd. I would not want to watch this movie again. The only reason I watched the entire thing was because I was on a plane
B006JD48NM|5.0|Not an F1 Fan, but thought this might be interesting. Watched on Prime Video Streaming. Fantastic story, Had no idea such personal drama existed in F1 at that time. . . Better than any lame scripted racing movie I have seen. The style of the film is such that you have to watch carefully to pick up the subtle things the filmaker wanted you to see. I would have like to have seen a little more about Prost after Senna's death, like an interview or something that showed his emotions.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My girlfriend started reading this trilogy and suggested i read it. At first i thought it was a book for teens but it is quite the opposite.  Once i started reading it i couldnt put it down.  It was fun, sad, exciting.  One of the best series i have read!  The content is pretty graphic.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Works great on my HTC Evo. The game is awesome. I wish all you people writing reviews would stick to the game and not that it doesn't work on your particular device.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|I can see bills that are due, set future reminders and see how much that will be paid that month!  The software is plain and simple and nice to look at.  Just what I need to get a birdseye view of my monthly BILLS!  I like it!
B0073PZIYI|1.0|Save your time and skip this movie.  This would make a great MST3K flick. The movie was filled with bad science, misquoted Darwinism, and bad props. Why oh why would the electric cars of the near future have catalytic converters on them?  All that separate the \\"time zones\\" are low concrete barriers and one guard station.  The folks from the poorer time zones should be able to overrun it easily.
B001A5W8YA|3.0|I gave this book three stars mostly not because of the story, but because of the way it was turned into an ebook. Many parts were missing making later in the book confusing. As for the story it self it was good but slow at times. My advice; pay the shipping and get it in paperback.
0446608955|5.0|This was a great read. I finished the book the same day I recieved it in the mail. It was one of those books that you just can't put down. I would recommend this if you are looking for a very beautiful & innocent story line.
B005VTGB0S|5.0|This is a case you can take to work with you, as appropriate in the boardroom as at home. The black pebbled finish leather looks great, and the multiple position stand is very convenient for desktop or tabletop use.<br /><br />This folio is too thin to fit well over the iPad 1, but the newer iPad fits nicely in it. Great for a graduation gift.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I have all the paid Angry Birds. The ads are annoying here but it is a good way to try the full game. The birds are great and the physics fun, I am buying the full game!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|If you want to know more about Apple and Steve Jobs the man this is a great book. I learned alot while reading. I recomend this as a great read.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I'm a fan of crime novels and this one was superb. Just like Law & Order, this novel seemed to be plucked from the headlines, but with twists. Defending Jacob is one of those books that has kept me thinking long past finishing it. It examines the issue of nature versus nurture, \\"murder genes\\" and unconditional love for your child. Overall, the book kept me on the edge of my seat until the very last page. I highly recommend.
0937381888|5.0|This is a great book for first time brewers.  Simple enough to follow, but technical enough to help you understand the processes.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|mandatory twenty word minimum comment outlining what a wonderful game this is and its general rofliciousness, ending with a strong encouragement to download this yourself, and an unnecessary addendum about not being a public speaker but feeling this app deserves a better rating than 3.5
B0042Y9YVG|5.0|I don't know who chose the songs on this album, but every one of them has its' own appeal. And will make you feel romantic and wonderful. Men - (over 60) if you want to charm your significant other, play this music for her. It works on me, every time....
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have put off reading this book for quite awhile, for one I don't really do series books and didn't want to get stuck in a series. What usually happens is the first book is incredible,then they make 3-4 more books that are so-so. I am a firm believer that series books are way to drawn out, and wind up boring me. But, this book was amazing, and I should have never waited as long as I did to read this book. I couldn't put this book down, I was finding every excuse to take five mins. away to get to the next page. The book was filled with non stop action, not to mention the characters were all very likeable. Without seeing the pictures of the characters that are portrayed in the movies, I had my own belief on exactly what they looked like. I also hate love triangles, I find they are quick to ruin books. You fall in love with the one character and then they are getting to the character you hate. I like both guys, they both have loveable characters and for two totally different reasons. I can see why she's falling for both of them. I am anxious to see what the next book is like, and i'm hoping my theory on series is not going to come true. I can't imagine this author disapointing me, this book was so well written and just got my attention right from the begining..  Do not prolong any time on reading this book, it's amazing and trust me when I say this is a page turner you will not be able to put down. Two days with a few hours of sleep just to see what happens.. Now on to next one!!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Well i got this when it was the app of the day a while ago and never used it till now. Its pretty cool even though the tech is old.
0439023521|5.0|I was read The Hunger Games because I wanted something to blow through really quickly. And that, that I did. And Catching Fire too! 5 Stars for this book.<br /><br />This series is right up there for me with Harry Potter and the Vampire Academy--I hesitate to compare any thing to these series because they're so phenominal and different in their own rights, but it is the best comparison I can think of at the moment--because Suzanne Collins has created this whole new world. New rules, new beliefs, new fears, new...well I could go on, but I'll stop.<br /><br />Several of my friends read this series before me, and I have to be honest and say that I really hate when my friends read books before me. It is not because I want to be first, but they build it up, or tear it down--there's nothing wrong with that, it is what I'm doing myself in this very review--but it taints my view of the book before I even begin. They told me not to get attached to any of the characters because you never know which ones will survive and which ones will be killed off. And while this is true, I wish I hadn't know it before hand. Which totally stinks because I just shared it with you. It is just that because of this, I truly have been expecting everyone to die. And therefore none of the plot twists (no matter if it included a death or was just an unexpected event) have really caught me all that off guard. And that just kind of sucks. I enjoy the twists and unexpected events. I enjoy the not knowing. It is the experience of reading, of exploring, of adventure. It's why when my friends get to a good part in a book that I've read before them and they come to me begging me to tell them what happens that I just can't bring myself to do it. I'd rather tell you how a book makes me feel rather than what happened during it. That is for you to explore and find out for yourselves.<br /><br />That being said, the Hunger Games made me experience and feel alot. I always begin a book on the lookout for who the protagonist is either already in love with or going to fall in love with. I have reasons I feel strongly about that have caused me to rule out various characters in all books that I read and characters to pick out as that very person, and it is no different for this one. After finishing Catching Fire, I'm still holding out hope for who I think that person is. But Katniss goes through so much in this book that you feel yourself. Fear is one of the biggest emotions and themes throughout the majority of this book. It's that fear that drives you forward, to keep reading at an increased and accelerated pace. There's also sadness, a need to protect those she loves, a need she can't always meet. And there are these very essential human moments in such a terrible Game created to keep the citizens of this world in check. Moments that I wont describe because of my feelings toward the experience. It just shows that even though the world that we live in verses the characters that we read about may be very different, basic humanity remains very much the same.<br /><br />As I said, 5 Stars. This book easily kept my attention. Kept me reading--quickly.

B007KQ6XYY|1.0|If I wanted to pay for stuff in the game instead of paying for the game I would get the free version. More of the game companies are moving to the business model that we hate. This doesn't even have near as much content as the first and I got that one for free. You have permanently lost this customer.
0862047862|4.0|I finally finished. The beginning of this book was challenging to say the least. After digging further into the story, I understood the necessity of the information presented in the first 200 pages. However, initially pushing through those pages wasn't always easy.<br /><br />This book was a bit out of my typical genre, but I'm glad I branched out. The story was multi-layered and all of the pieces fit together so nicely. There were definitely disturbing scenes that I wasn't expecting at all. Even though this book is fiction it just goes to show you that there are truly some disturbed, mentally sick people out there. And you don't always know who they are.<br /><br />I really enjoyed how the story built and built the further you got into it. It didn't wait until the last 100 pages to climax and resolve. It grew in intensity even from the tough beginning. In the same way, I really enjoyed the ending. I'm sure alot of readers will be disappointed with the very end, but I enjoyed that it left me wanting more. That just makes me curious about the next book. I already know that Salander is in both of the other books, but I really hope to see a reappearance of Mikael in the future books as well. We will see.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|This book, the fifth in the series comes after a 6 year wait. It turns out, it was not worth waiting for.<br /><br />The prose is meandering and simplistic, the plotlines confusing, and the story is...boring. We travel endlessly with characters we don't care about, watching them walk, or sail, then walk, then sail some more. Many of the chapters I literally just skipped through as I didn't really care- and the info I needed was in the last paragraph (I am thinking of the Dorne chaps...).<br /><br />The language and prose is so bad it is amazing this got through editing. That's fame, I guess.<br /><br />I think the best art is usually the simplest (in it's simplicity conveying great depth and complexity), and it is actually more difficult to convey power and beauty in less words than more. Even Tolkien wrote a trilogy. ASOIAF could be written in literally 3 books. Maybe 2 long books.<br /><br />The fact that nothing/little is resolved and new plotlines are actually opened means we have at least 2 more books, and if they take 10 more years, that puts grrm well into his 70's. I hope he has kept copious notes.<br /><br />I think as a new reader what is all the more infuriating is if you visit his blog titled \\"not a blog\\", you see him peddling his old books, posting trailers for the new series of HBO's A Game of Thrones, going to conventions, and commenting on football. Since Dance was written, he has said literally nothing about writing the next book- seemingly he hasn't. For fans, to watch him in full on marketing mode, extending the wait and then pushing out a poorly written, boring book is inexcusable.

B00571F26Y|5.0|After reading this book, I've changed my eating habits and in just a couple of weeks I feel fabulous.  I thought I was very healthy - all my numbers on blood tests have always been in the \\"great\\" range and I'm a tiny bit paunchy, but not overweight......but eliminating wheat from our diet has made a world of difference in how we FEEL.  Before I bought the book I thought it was about a \\"diet\\" - the science outlined in this book really opened my eyes, and the way the book is written makes for a supremely interesting read.  It's not a \\"diet\\" book, it's a life changing book - I've already recommended it to many.

B007MGWBU2|1.0|What is wrong with these reviewers? This was a total waste of 5 bucks. It only confirmed that, like the storyline, the muppets ARE 'dead' like Richman says. I miss Jim Henson.
B00785P2QC|3.0|it is a learning process with this game. still getting the hang of it. little details that you need to pay attention to. probably will change my rating later.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Not much to say.  Listen one time to Adele and it is all said.  I am an ecclectic music lover.  I tend to like the voices that are immediately recognized and Adele is right up there with Stevie Nicks who has been my favorite forever.  Music, words, voice can bring me to tears.

B003EYVXV4|4.0|i liked the movie alot and think that they kept the storyline pretty close to the book. the thing that kept me from rating it five stars was how some of the plot was rushed and small things that would have been simple to keep in the movie were taken out. the movie overall was great!

B006OFN0SE|4.0|I don't know much history about Hoover.  I did appreciate that the movie was meant to be historically thought-provoking. I have this fear that few good movies are made to day because deep issues require deep-thinking and soul searching.  I sense most of the public does not go to movies to think deeply (or for that matter, very much at all). If its a comedy-- they expect it to be light and superficial--they're going to laugh and forget about their life.<br />  Most people though pretend that they don't mind seeing something deeper, more profound, thought -provoking. I suspect that either they want an historical account with lots of explosive action and a few snappy  super-cliche -lines or else something that a fifth -grader can quickly absorb and comprehend. Most of life is dull or tedious and they want all their laughs and action  sardine-canned in 90 minutes (or less) attention deficit?<br /> Sure , by definition, there may be some tedious detail (not so tedious for history buffs), but this detail is needed to build the understanding of the intense motivation behind  future  villian vs. hero action.(It's a richer tapestry--rather than a simple etch-a sketch---detail equals understanding why and  creates the necessary motivation.) I crave this detail to fill out the greater breadth and depth of who these people are and especially WHY they did the things they did.<br /> Great movie-making is dying because people don't want to be BURDENED with too much to think about. But we do need to know more richly why they do the things they do---and that is what makes their ultimate choices and action so COMPELLING.<br />  I thought this movie was excellent because it came through on these accounts. According to this movie, Hoover had an intense  over-simplification of black and -white, which hurt him and others. But his intense determination to follow right and wrong, though twisted in some parts was compelling, ususally admirable and sometimes cruel. He was, if nothing else ,passionate. 8/10 stars

B007N6EUHI|5.0|As a PTA student I love Visible Body. When I got my Kindle for Christmas I went online too see if I could log on to my account and use it and I was so sad that the Kindle was not compatable.  I was so excited that an app finally made its way, but the cost was high as you can see.  The biggest thing I wondered about was if it was a one time fee since to have it on a PC you have to pay yearly. I called and asked Amazon and they said its one time so I installed it. I also wondered if you have to be connected to the Internet to use it and I'm so excited to tell you, you don't!!  I wasn't sure how smooth it would run on the Kindle, but its very smooth. I actually prefer it to going on my HP to use it. I have never written a review before. I felt that for the price I needed to share in case anyone was wondering the same things. If your a student I think it's great and way better to carry the Kindle around than a laptop wondering if there will be Internet access when you want to study. Hope this helps:)
B004YF6MHW|4.0|Convenient photo app to make use of filters & editing when your computer is not available. The filters & effects that come with app are nice. The developer's support for this app is exceptional by providing added filters & effects free of charge. Just go to their website and add them.<br />The other features I enjoyed were the camera tweaks, such as Burst Shot & Camera Stable shot, that does not come standard to most Android camera. Makes your Android feel like a full featured digital camera.

B007MNV5WU|5.0|Angry Birds Space is the perfect sequell.  Take one part of what we love from previous games add a new twist to gameplay, perfect it and add a little bit more awesome and you have this game ... price is no factor and the pay versions will use less battery than the ad supported versions.
B0053KWDES|4.0|I love this thing. I needed an amp to power my awesome but severely high impedance AKG 701's on my iPhone and Sony D-25. It pairs perfectly with these headphones--it really fills in the bass that these headphones lack, and even makes my iPhone sound great. It makes listening to music on the already amazing Sony D-25 even better! I now feel no need to own a high end audio setup, it's all here!<br /><br />My only gripe is that you cannot use the amp while charging the battery. You would think that hooking this thing up to wall power would be an option, even though this thing is meant to be portable. I dread a time where I want to listen to music only to find the battery dead, and then have to waste 3 hours charging it. For this, i deduct a star. Otherwise highly recommended!
B004LROUNG|3.0|I've read most of John Grishman's books and although I enjoyed the litigators it had many longer parts that were almost to the point of repeatition. Still, a good read, just not as good as some others I've recently read.
B00466HN72|2.0|If you go into this hoping it is another clever, funny creation like \\"Despicable Me\\" then you will be sorely disappointed.  If you are hoping for a candy colored adorable ride through the world of the Easter bunny, you will also be disappointed.  If what you are looking for is more along the lines of the Smurf and Chipmunks CGI/live action mashups, then you will come away at least somewhat satisfied, but that sure is a low bar to set for a film...<br /><br />Hop starts off at quite the encouraging hop.  E.B. as a baby bunny with his huge cotton tail and adorable mannerisms is just too precious for words.  He is being raised to take over for his father, who is THE current Easter Bunny and the one that makes it happen every Easter.  All those eggs and baskets in such a short time, even the little bunny is feeling pressured already to fill in such huge rabbit shoes.  One of the best parts of the movie is here, a look into the glorious factory that makes all the candy on Easter Island.  It is cleverly designed with rainbows of skittles, shiny Hershey's kisses, chocolate easter bunnies, baskets being filled, it's controlled chaos in a sticky sweet setting that is clever and awe inspiring.  It gives you hope for the film... that is until you see the interview with the script writers in the extras.  All they had to write was \\"factory\\" and OTHER people did all the work in making that something memorable.  Too bad their imaginations weren't set free on the story for Hop, otherwise we'd see something better than a movie concocted by people boring enough to just write \\"factory\\" and be done with it...<br /><br />E.B. grows up to be an antsy, rebellious, plaid wearing teenager.  He looks like something from the mid 90s or a skater kid in a bunny suit.  His dream is to drum... not be an Easter Bunny so instead of stepping up to the plate on the eve of his coronation as new Easter Bunny, he takes off, slacks off and annoys his way into the life of slacker Fred O'Hare, a human whohas let his father down as well, by being a leech on his family's goodwill and a sofa landmark.  They throw Fred out of the house for not getting grown up enough to even get a burger slinging job, but instead of being taught a lesson by having to sleep in his car or turn in some resumes, his sister sneaks out and gives him the keys to a mansion.  She just happens to be house sitting her boss's mansion... how convenient!<br /><br />So slacker E.B. and slacker Fred end up together in a mansion and hijinks ensue, although nothing particularly interesting.  There's a big with David Hasselhoff.  There's a rather inappropriate bit about the Playboy mansion as well, which was just insulting to have in a children's movie.  They didn't take it far enough to have to explain anything to my kids at least, but i'm sure others picked up on it.  And nothing in the movie particularly does anything amusing or right after that... the pink beret bunnies that are let out to capture E.B. and bring him back to Easter Island (under his father's orders) are adorable, and offer a bit of tension but they aren't fully realized either.<br /><br />There's a happy ending, a chick that wants to take over and be the Easter Bunny and almost kills E.B., Fred and The Easter Bunny by lowering them into some kind of boiling confection liquid, and they let the bird off the hook by the end... it's all swept under the rug.  Fred gets his dream job - of being the Easter Bunny (what?) and E.B. grows up just enough to realize he can drum AND be the co-Easter Bunny.  Roll credits.<br /><br />The kids liked it, but this is not one that many grown ups will want to be revisiting with its tired gags and embarrassing moments.  The rabbit getting overly friendly with Fred's sister and asking afterward if she's available was a cringe worthy creepy moment... that went on far too long.  Unfortunately HOP is filled with way too many of these eye-rolling bits that just make you wish it would all go back to Easter Island... at least things were more interesting and fantastical there.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|This app works very well on my phone, has lots of different choices for displaying the weather, and is very informative.  It doesn't seem to drain my battery which I appreciate, since this phone has poor battery life.  The one thing that I can think of right now that aggravates me is that it has been raining for about 2 hours, if not longer, and current conditions is only showing overcast.  I think the app could stand to be a bit more accurate, obviously, but overall - great app.

B007MNV5WU|4.0|angry birds is already a great game, in all 3 of the previous versions.  with the addition of gravitational effects in the space version: awesome!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I received it promptly. I have watched only one of the movies in the set till now and it lived upto my expectations for a blu ray disc.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this is a great game. if you want to see how it works go to youtube.com and look up roosterteeth they are doing videos on this game on how to get 3 stars in all levels so go check it out before buying this. i reconend it
B004T2QZL8|5.0|After they fixed it so it wouldn't force close, it became a great game... my only gripe with it was the timer for the hints but I guess it forced you to think a little...
B007MNV5WU|5.0|An excellent addition to the angry birds family!  The space element adds a new and fresh aspect of game play... highly recommend it if you love the other games.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|I wanted to start this review by saying that this release, is not only great on Blu-Ray, it represents great value for money.<br />BD disc, DVD for the car or other room, digital copy AND soundtrack, available as a download code in MP3 format (no actual soundtrack CD is included)<br /><br />The story of the movie is simple, and as I'm sure others have noted, mirrors today in a World where the Muppets, are old hat, forgotten, and no longer recognized.<br />The story of getting back together for one \\"big\\" show, to raise money for the side plot, is curiously topical, as this movie in itself has launched the Muppets back from their relative obscurity.<br />I loved the simple story, and I remember enjoying the Muppets from their beginnings, in what really is a long time ago.<br />Over the years they morphed into Elmo, Fraggle Rock and innumerable Jim Henson exploits to keep up with the times, but Kermit and the gang were always at the heart, the original, still the best.<br />The fairly thin plot deals with Kermit and new friends tracking down the old gang, and trying to get the show on, to stop evil oil baron Chris Cooper (who is enjoying chewing scenery every second he's on screen) from tearing down their theater and studio.<br />A whole host of well known actors pop up in funny cameos to pad out the story, and Jack Black as the kidnapped celebrity host is a blast!<br />It's plain fun, good songs, dance routines and sillyness, and I loved it!<br />I suspect this movie will probably appeal more to older parents, and original fans, who will enjoy taking a whole new generation through the magical ride of the Muppets.<br /><br />I gave it 5 stars, clean family fun, with enough to keep the adults and kids laughing together.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool (omnibus ed) is a fantastic read.  At first curious to put the peices together I became obsessed with finding out what happens next.  This book is a sympathetic look into the lives of people living in their own world, minding their own business and shows remarkable insight into the layers within each society.  It is an exciting new take on the old armageddon theme and it kept me flashing through pages until the finish.  The extra bonus - there are no vampires in it!  Thanks Hugh... keep writing.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|The only problem with this game is that it sets the bar too high. Now I can't find anything half as good to play and I have to wait for them to create a new one. It's challenging and the graphics are beautiful. It can be very difficult at times, but the hints and helps are great without giving away the whole show. Perfect for when you just get stuck and need a nudge. I highly recommend this game.

B005KR6OBM|5.0|My best purchase yet, from Amazon! I put off purchasing the Season 1 - 4 box set of The Big Bang Theory due to the price at other stores. The price I paid was more than reasonable and the vendor was very easy to deal with. I received the set in less time than promised and the quality was the best and in new condition. No bootlegs here! Thank you so much! I plan to make Amazon my FIRST stop for TV DVDs and Movies in the future!
B007K1E8VY|5.0|Frankie Stein looks absolutely gorgeous in her Skull Shores outfit. Yes, it is really in gray-scale, doll and packaging. What a great idea! Whoever designs these dolls is extremely talented! The Frankie Stein comic-con doll is also in gray-scale but is an expensive collectors item. This doll, is a wonderful way to get the beauty of the gray-scale Frankie for a low price. The other thing I LOVE about this doll, is her hairstyle. They have given her a cute bob that curls under. She normally has long straight hair. I am an adult collector, and this doll is staying in her box, so I can't review the durability. But collector-wise, she is a MUST! I would suggest snapping this doll up fast before she gets as hard to find as some of the others and the price starts to go up.<br />*side eyes certain amazon sellers*
0694013013|5.0|Got this for my son when he was a little under two, and it turned out to be perfect for that time. He was at a super-active stage physically, and he just loved the idea of copying the actions in the book - from thumping his chest to wiggling his toes! He was already familiar with all the animals and the objects of the actions (chest, hips, toes, etc.), so it made it very easy and interesting for him. I suspect that this might have been a great book even a year before when he was discovering his body parts and animals. I'd suggest buying this around the age of 1 and keeping it for a long time.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I think this is great it challenges you on every game. each time you unlock a new game you come across a new challenge.
0805053883|5.0|The twin of Brown Bear, Brown Bear, this book is similar to the other one, but scores an extra point because it adds sounds to its offerings. This might be one of my son's top 3 books since the age of 6 months simply because he has so much fun listening to me (or any of us) making the sounds of the animals. Actually, I think he saw us more than he saw the book in his first year, because he was just fascinated by all the sounds! This is not to take credit away from the book - were it not for the book, those opportunities would not have been created. Super book, and totally essential to the baby collection.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|If I had to read the words, \\"Oh My\\" one more time, I think my head would explode....come on, people....this book was about as exciting as a PTA meeting!
0805092447|5.0|Our copy is in tatters, but my son just can't get enough of this book and its twin (Polar Bear, Polar Bear...). He enjoyed the colours as a tiny baby, the objects as he grew older, and I'm not sure what appeals to him now, but it's still a great comfort book for him. Buy this as early as possible - this is a must-have in your baby books collection.
B005PK1G76|5.0|This fits well for the UppaBaby Vista, seems to stay put & plenty off room for drinks, Keys, phone etc.<br />The only draw back for me is that with the Vista it has the foamy kind of handle (which is the only thing I hate about the stroller)... anyhow after positioning the organizer I'm worried that the remaining velcro that is exposed will mess up the handle so I'm going to see if my husband can wrap that part of the velcro strap with some black electrical tape (hopefully it won't be noticeable)
0143039830|5.0|Firstly, prospective readers need to be clear that this can barely pass off as a piece of detective fiction; actually, it isn't one at all - it's a highbrow literary and philosophical adventure. The three novellas that comprise this book are journeys into the self - seemingly autobiographical, but, more biographical, about You, the reader, irrespective of who you are ((I've tested this hypotheses and empirical evidence seems to support it). And that, if you think about it, is a remarkable feat - how the author manages to talk to the hearts and minds of most readers.<br /><br />Here's where the book is like a detective fiction: in its whole - in the structure, in the thoughts, in the style. The author raises many different questions - about the characters, the stories, the self, and about literature as a whole - throughout the book, leaves a bunch of clues strewn across the pages, and I walked away with some answered questions, but a bunch of unanswered ones too. I'm fairly convinced, however, that the answers are in there, and that is enough to make me read this a second time.<br /><br />I'm not sure if a second reading will change my opinion, but as of now, I think this book is a great literary and intellectual adventure - actually, a great \\"trip\\".
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was probably the best book I have ever read. I began reading and thought that the book just, wasn't me, but I was so far off. I got through the first ten pages and was addicted. I spent every moment of free time reading this book until I finished at 3:30 one morning. I was enthralled by Katniss and Peeta's story and their love triangle with Gale. I was extremely satisfied with The Hunger Games, and I recommend all three books to everyone.
B0076NKNLA|5.0|I am a big Marilyn Monroe Fan and was not sure if I should even see that movie having very low expectations for Michelle Williams' performance. She is a good actress but I could not imagine her playing that role. But what a surprise! The movie was very entertaining and Michelle Williams so good I completely forgot sometimes that it was not Marilyn. The young male actor - Eddie? - was also terrific. I will look up his name now and never forget it! I also liked that the movie stuck mostly to the book!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a really good buy, if you like reading this will fit you like a glove. It is the first book in the 3 book series, it's a really great series. Amazon has all the books and I have bought and read each. I can tell you that you will like this book and the two that follow and that they are fast reads. You will not want to stop once you start, good book promise!  Jeff
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i could not set it down. i hear the movie was so much like the book. this book is the best book ever and i think everyone should read it.
B004LWZW8I|2.0|Maybe we'd have enjoyed this movie more, if we actually could have seen more of it. As it was, our dvd was too dark to see even half of the movie on our big-screen tv. Was it like this for other people? Why waste time making a movie that cannot be viewed worth a damn?

B00555X8OA|5.0|Just when you thought you actually knew something about how your brain and decision-making apparatus work, along comes the author to let you know that you really know nothing at all about it. Enormously insightful, jaw-droppingly surprising in some of its revelations, and ultimately a bit humbling for any thinking human. I couldn't possibly recommend this book any more highly, again, for any thinking human. You need to read this book to allow yourself a fighting chance at not making too many dumb-da-dumb-dumb choices in life. All you 'pure instinct' folks, read a bit and better understand the forces at work in making those instinctive decisions. 'Pure reason' advocates, read up and see how you may be reasoning through irrelevant things. Read this book!!

B003Y5H5HO|4.0|I did not feel as much of a compulsion to see the American version of 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo', as I did with the Swedish film. How could this newer version ever compare to the exquisite Swedish version? However, was there ever a more perfect Lisbeth than Rooney Mara, she completely won me over.<br /><br />In the Swedish version, we were given the bleak, white/black doomed version of the Swedish countryside and the personalities of its inhabitants. It seems they were good or evil. In the American film, Rooney Mara brings the isolation and complete vulnerability of Lisbeth. Maybe it was that in this version, Lisbeth's story is told from a different standpoint, it is her version without the complication of Mikael Blomkvist's character. We could feel her distance, emotionally and physically. She is alone, she isolates herself from her sexual partners as well as those who she deals with. Lisbeth does not smile, not does she make much of an expression at any time. Rooney Mara was able to take this character and give us this added dimension. It is not until she starts working with Mikael, who likes her and trusts her, that she will finally reveal some emotion, but it is not complete trust, nor should it be. It is Lisbeth's story that interests us. Mikael Blomkvist is interesting, but it is an added attraction. Daniel Craig did a great job, but he was missing the vulnerability and lack of confidence that I knew Mikael from the novel.<br /><br />This American version was so well done, that it had an edge in my book. What I did miss was the Swedish language and the sub titles, somehow they added to the mystery of these characters. Christopher Plummer was the perfect Henrik Vanger. Of course, Christopher Plummer is perfection in any of his roles. The other characters were well done and did not separate themselves in much fashion. I did not find Robin Wright as convincing as Erika Berger, she did not give off the sexuality that I felt from the Swedish version.<br /><br />This film stands alone as a great film, but it is Rooney Mara who makes this film. She is all of the superlatives, and I felt a deep connection to her character. I hope we see her again in the second and third version of the trilogy.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 03-24-12<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0070Z97LG Dream House]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B006K004FU Tanner Hall]]r />This film stands alone as a great film, but it is Rooney Mara who makes this film.

0439023513|4.0|Katniss may never have heard the Who sing, \\"Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.\\" But in the end, she realizes that's exactly what has happened. And she instinctively makes the only sensible decision . . . then lets the chips fall where they may. I'm presuming this will eventually be adapted to film, but its apocalyptic scenes are going to be tough even on a lot of adults. It's less \\"Harry Potter\\" and more \\"Battleship Potemkin.\\" Only if you've seen real war action, I think, will you \\"get it.\\" It's exhausting, taking you right into the minds of characters with PTSD. It's not so much about how Katniss holds onto her loves Peeta or Gale; it's about how she holds onto her humanity. In this, the story is like \\"Lord of the Flies.\\" One thing this story completely lacks is any mention of a God or religion. It is an utterly secular world. One wonders how the direction might have changed if one of the characters had been saintlike. But maybe that was the whole point: to show the consequences of a world without God.

B0053O89KG|5.0|What is unique about Castle is the humanity of the characters. The relationships among all the characters and especially Castle and his daughter and mother are well drawn and complex. Castle and Beckett of course are wonderfully paired, very seductive. It is refreshing to watch a show that becomes familiar to you in a warm way, almost as if you were part of the family.
0545265355|3.0|~~~~~~~~~~<br />SPOILER ALERT!<br />~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />The first book is wonderful except for the ending (more on that in a sec). The premise of The Hunger Games and the post-USA society of Panem are compelling to say the least. The violence is handled well and without using kid gloves. Katniss begins the trilogy as a strong, capable female heroine that popular fiction needs more of.<br /><br />But, by not killing off a major character at the end of book 1 (you decide who), Collins writes herself into a love triangle-shaped hole that she spends an additional two books digging herself out of, never quite recovering. The second book spends so much time retreading the same ground as the first and doesn't really get going until well into the second hundred pages. Finally, the buildup to Mockingjay and Katniss's inability to embrace her heroic mantle were extremely unsatisfying. It became a story about a hero I didn't want to read about, a hero who would rather sulk in broom closets than do anything useful. Her final act of defiance was too little, too late in my opinion.<br /><br />The whole time I read this series I tried to bear in mind that this is young adult fiction and that I am not necessarily the target demographic. I really did. But there are some things that are just unforgivable in fiction, namely the insane amount of deus ex machina in these books and secondly the way Suzanne Collins writes in present-tense from only one character perspective. Writing in present tense is a trend that needs to stop and it is absolutely unforgivable in a world of this magnitude that we are stuck in Katniss's present perspective.  It's just not interesting and the only purpose for this limitation is so that you can rush the story along, without having to explain any of the ancillary details.<br /><br />This rushing pace is irritating for the most part but it works well in tense situations or moments of action. Seeing Katniss stalking prey through the forest, using her quickthinking and cleverness to trap other contestants, trying to keep pace with her companions through the jungle while avoiding numerous traps and pitfalls - these moments are gripping and totally readable. It's only when Collins tries to pull the camera back and increase the scope of her narrative that it falls flat. If all the characters aren't in one room, she just doesn't hold it together for me. I blame this entirely on the present tense style.<br /><br />I would also argue that Katniss was downright unreliable as a narrator by the end of the trilogy, because so many of the world-changing events were happening beyond her control.  Between being unconscious or paralyzed by indecisiveness most of the time, could it be so hard to introduce another perspective character at appropriate times? Perhaps we could hear a bit about how Gale is holding down the fort at District 12 while Katniss competes in the Games, or about Peeta as he struggles against the weapons of his torturers during his captivity, or about Haymitch and Plutarch politicking in District 13 while Katniss is recovering, or about the rebels fighting in the other districts? Perhaps fleshing out the characters a bit more would have made me care when almost all of the secondary ones introduced at the beginning of Catching Fire and Mockingjay were systematically killed off by the end of each book.<br /><br />While there is much wasted potential for discerning readers and a half-hearted ending that only barely fulfills the promises made by the previous plot points, the thing about this series that is commendable is its accessibility and the enthusiasm with which people read it. Nothing since the Harry Potter series seems to hold so many kids' and irregular adult readers' attention like The Hunger Games trilogy and everyone is talking about it, especially with the movie out now. For this reason alone I would recommend everyone check it out, as there are some interesting parallels that can be drawn to our presentsociety. It is a good warm-up for young readers before books like Brave New World, Lord of the Flies and 1984 that some high school classes read.<br /><br />Finally, kudos to whoever is responsible for the great cover art and jacket design for this set. I love it and it looks great on a shelf.

B006HGXGWU|2.0|There is some good acting in Take Shelter, and an interesting and nicely developed story line.  It has a nice feel for life in our complex times, and life in a small town.<br /><br />But as many reviewers have noted, it could use about 15 minutes of editing.  And especially the last minute, it completely undoes the movie and makes you feel you've just wasted the last two hours of your life.

B004X75RK4|3.0|Margaret Tate, \\"Satan's mistress\\" (Sandra Bullock), is a high powered publisher and Canadian citizen. She finds due to a few faux pas, she is about to be deported. So she bullies her executive assistant Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) into marriage, thus \\"The Proposal\\". However the tide may have turned when she sees his home and family.<br /><br />Many people think Grandma Annie (Betty White) makes the movie with her dry one-liners and attitude. And a lot of Betty white the actor shows through Grandma Annie the character.<br /><br />The movie mostly takes place in a mock up of what Sitka Alaska should look like. It makes you want to go there.  One of my favorite scenes is when Margaret is warned not to let the puppy outside or the eagles will snatch it.<br /><br />Be sure to listen to the voice over commentary. Most voice over commentaries are dry dissertations from film historians or drunks that do not remember the movie. This commentary however is quite interesting and informative.<br /><br />Also be sure to watch the alternate ending.<br /><br />Again Blu-ray is just Blu-ray so I will not bore you with the details.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002NZK5V4 Practical Magic (Keepcase) ~ Sandra Bullock]]

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I bought this book on my Kindle due to the large number of positive reviews; I'm 35% done with it, and I have to say, I'm pretty disappointed so far. Like others have said, the quality of the writing is poor. That makes sense, once you learn that this book originated online as Twilight fan fiction. That's not a dig on Twilight...I actually really enjoyed that series...but the fact that this is fan fiction shows. There are some parallels between this book and Twilight...the dangerous boy, the good girl...but E.L. James barely has a fraction of the writing talent that Stephenie Meyer does. Meyer's characters are relatable, with some depth to them...James' characters are pretty ridiculous. Let me just point out some things about the main character, Anastasia Steele, that are absurd (no spoilers here, don't worry):<br /><br />1. Not only is she a virgin (that might be believable), but she has never held a man's hand. Seriously?<br />2. She's made it through college, but she doesn't have a computer? She's been using her roommate's laptop for 4 years? WTF?<br />3. She doesn't have an e-mail address? What?! Has she been registering for college via paper forms and communicating with her professors via written letters? Come on!<br /><br />Some of those are nitpicky things, but honestly, they are so ridiculously absurd and unrealistic that I just can't buy in to this girl as a character. Also, how many pairs of grey pants and white linen shirts does this dude own? Is that all he ever wears?<br /><br />Another thing about James' writing that is seriously annoying: her overuse of certain words and phrases. I must've read the phrase \\"Holy crap\\" no less than 15 times before I was 15% into this book, and that's not an exaggeration. She uses the phrase \\"out of my depth\\" probably 3 or 4 times within as many pages at one point. And if I have to read one more thing about Ana biting her lip I might scream...this must've been used 10 times already, and like I said, I'm only 35% in. I'malso getting fed up with Ana's \\"subconscious\\" (aren't you supposed to be unaware of your subconscious anyways?) and her \\"inner goddess\\"...is she schizophrenic? Enough already!<br /><br />I'm going to keep slogging through this book because I paid for it and I'm hoping it'll get better, but I don't see it happening. I don't understand how so many people are so taken with this book...is it just because people find the sex exciting? I'm sure there are erotic books out there that contain better writing than this...

0307266303|4.0|Great: this book completely reinspired me about running<br />Great: some great research - historical, scientific, sporting, and anthropological<br />Great: an easy read<br />Not so great: its writting in a racy (ah, pun intended), journalistic style. He has earned his stripes, by really participating in the story as it unfolds, and the content is great. But the style is a bit TOO racy, a bit too glib. Yes, he writes for Men's Health, that racy magazine with decent content. I would have preferred something a little more mature. His content is so good it doesnt need the little flags - references to naked women wrestling etc. For me, that detracts from the story, and hypes it up too much.<br />And still, worth the read.
0439023521|5.0|Unlike most people I can honestly say I have been reading the Hunger Games since it came out.. Before the movie.. before the hype I saw it on a library shelf and picked up. I felt intrigued by it and when Catching Fire came out I devoured it. I felt The Hunger Games is the best of the trilogy! Since pretty much everyone knows the story, it's simple kids fight to the death and one girl falls in love with her supposed to be enemy. Now that I saw the movie I can honestly say the book is way better than the movie.. while the movie was good it didn't have the effect the book had on me originally. This book has inspired me to read more Dystopias like Divergent and the Maze Runner!

0439023521|5.0|i wont go into many details as there are many reviews that spotlight the storyline and main elements of the books. all i can say is that after i started reading the first book , i found myself finishing the third in three days (including work and university). i would stay up till 4 am not bearing the thought of putting the book down. the author walks a fine line between horror and glory, victory and despair with pivotal events that shape the book every few pages. this is by far one of the best reads i've enjoyed in a very very long time :)
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|Combine this screenplay with this cast and you have an excellent piece. George Clooney, in one of his best roles, leads. He's excellent in the part.<br />Rather than an \\"In your face\\" plot, this is very subtle, quiet, and attention grabbing.<br />George is trying to survive one tribulation after another. He's joined by his 17 & 10 year old daughters. The plot is serious, yet touching. It's comical in spots in a tongue in cheek way.<br /><br />The movie shows us various parts of the human psyche. The ability to deal with the unexpected surprises life throws our way. It's not your typical tear jerker which has been done forever. This is fresh, different, and so well done. The story of a man & his family doing the right thing in the face of adversity, including a great deal of anger & anguish.<br /><br />The main, as well as the supporting cast, seem to stay completely focused making this a touching \\"Must see\\"

0802473156|5.0|\\"The 5 Love Languages\\" is really a very simple, basic book. I fear those who left negative reviews have overcomplicated matters.  There is no need to over-analyze 5LL.<br /><br />The 5 languages, as repeated throughout the text, are:  Quality Time-Receiving Gifts-Words of Affirmation--Acts of Service and Physical Touch. The author believes they are gender-neutral and tend to remain with us for life. Helpful and realistic hints are offered when one is unable to discover either his own or his spouses' language. All advice is in plain vanilla talk.<br /><br />For the record this reviewer discovered, after 22 years of marriage,that his languages squared nicely with those of his wife! Who knew?  That nugget is certainly worth the modest purchase price.<br /><br />This is a fine, helpful, pleasant easy to read handbook.  How anyone cannot benefit at least in a small fashion from reading 5LL is beyond this reviewer.

B00466HN6S|5.0|Okay, HOP is just too cute for its own good, but is that a crime?  Not if the cuteness is doled out purposefully as it is in HOP.  How else can you do a movie about the Easter Bunny if you don't dispend belief and hop on the fantasy bandwagon.  Devised by the same team that gave us the far superior DESPICABLE ME, the movie is just what I expected---and I had a good time watching it.  James Marsden as the main human brings a wide-eyed \\"Aw Shucks\\" charm to his role as the ne'er-do-well slacker who bonds with the rebellious E.B. Who wants to be a drumming superstar.  Russell Brand, better heard than seen, voices E.B. Perfectly.  Kaley Cuolo, Elizabeth Perkins and Gary Cole provide minimal support as Marsden's disgruntled family and Chelsea Handler & David Hasselhoff provide amusing cameos.  Hugh Laurie gives veddy British voice to EB's father but it is the always scene stealing Hank Azaria whose voicing of the treacherous chick Carlos provides the most fun.<br />HOP is far more enjoyable than similar live/animation misfires like ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS or the awful GARFIELD franchises.<br />HOP is fun for both kids and adults and really doesn't deserve the overall critical derision.  Get some jelly beans and enjoy!
B001453LSI|5.0|I drive truck for a living and as such I spend a great deal of time alone, except for the sound coming from the speakers of the radio, but over the years the influx of commercials time vs. music time has won over the airtime... hence I have tuned to the smart-phone when I tire of my recorded music.  It was while listening to an audio stream from my carrier's \\"jazz\\" station that I first discovered Melody Gardot.  A few years later and along comes Pandora and I plug in Melody's name to my list of stations I like to listen.  But as with all things that become popular to the masses...

Hooked my laptop up to the bigscreen LCD in the living room, and got my husband hooked on it as well.<br /><br />I've started to download some of the Season 2 episodes I've missed.

B00003CWPL|4.0|Like most David Lynch films, ERASERHEAD is extremely, extremely difficult to describe.  Shot in black and white and set in a grungy, unattractive, and factory-like dystopia, the film has a definable plot, at least of sorts.  Briefly, Henry (Jack Nance) gets his girlfriend Mary (Charlotte Stewart) pregnant, and she gives birth to what appears to be a non-human mutant.  She hates the creature, which refuses to eat and makes endless whining sounds, and she abandons both.  Henry makes an effort to care for the creature, but he experiences a number of inexplicable events that may or not be dream states that drive him to try to kill the creature.  His attempt backfires in a singular way.<br /><br />Different people describe the film in different ways.  Some consider it slow, and it is true that dialogue spare, the plot spotty, and the images are deliberately repetitive.  Some find it very funny, and it is true that there are moments when it displays an unexpectedly wacky sense of humore.  Some describe it as disgusting, and again it is true that the film's imagery includes a number of set pieces that about as appealing as a genital discharge.  But the chief comment about the film is that it doesn't seem to have a point.  I disagree with this: I felt the point of the film is to display an overwhelming sexual nausea.<br /><br />A great deal of the film's images consist of not-so-covert sexual references.  Near the film's beginning, Henry opens his mouth and emits what appears to a deformed or mutated sperm.  Later in the film, he discovers a facially deformed woman living inside his radiator, who sings of heaven in a simple childlike way and moves about a stage crushing similar sperm-like creatures by stomping them with her feet.  The camera constantly peers into boxes, orbs, trash cans, holes, and frequently espys pock-marked skin that seems to suggest veneral disease.  When Henry attempts to carve a chicken, it comes to life and pours out a bloody liquid.  He has, or perhaps dreams, of a sexual encounter with the woman who lives across the hall--but the experience is disrupted by the creature and degenerates into a series of unpleasant experiences.  Ultimately, when Henry attempts to kill the creature, it opens like a toxic vagina before transforming into what seems to be a grotesque sperm akin to the creature that came out of Henry's mouth at the beginning of the film.<br /><br />ERASERHEAD was clearly influenced by a number of earlier directors and artists, but is distinctly David Lynch's own, and it touches on the various effects that would ultimately make him famous: circular logic, bizarre and surreal imagery, and the creation of an intellectual and artistic exercise that is ultimately dark mystery.  I cannot say that I found the film appealing, and I cannot not imagine seeing it again, but I have to admit that, love it or hate it, ERASERHEAD is nonetheless memorable.  There have been several DVD releases, but the most commonly available seems to be one that includes the original trailer and a fairly long monologue by Lynch in which he describes how the film was made but otherwise gives away few secrets.  Its an arthouse flick from start to finish, and people who want a nice linear plot will loathe it, but if you're up for something entirely different, this is it.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer<br />For Nicky, long time feline companion, gone before his timeaps dreams, of a sexual encounter with the woman who lives across the hall--but the experience is disrupted by the creature and degenerates into a series of unpleasant experiences.

0307959856|5.0|Who better to accomplish the daunting task of reproducing the fascination of Austen's beloved Darcy and Elizabeth then Baroness James?  Attention to detail without overloading with boring displays of just how much research has obviously been done is impressive.  The mystery kept my interest and the development of George Wickham was particularly thought provoking.  I have no reservation in writing that I hope Jane Austen fans will read this book with as much pleasure as I did.
B007MG360G|5.0|I've bought all these Doodle games and each one is a blast however, this version was a bit short or maybe too easy. Still I loved every minute of it and enjoyed it while it lasted.
B001ECQ6PG|1.0|One of my greatest mistakes that I made recently is to purchase this item.  I have few hundred of LP, EP and SP records so that I really wanted to convert into digital files for all of them and pt01 was so fascinating for me.<br /><br />Upon purchasing, I realized that turntable revolution speed is completely inconsistent especially for 33 rpm LP.  I tried to switch with a couple of electric power however the problem does not resolved.<br /><br />Lastly, I realized that the turntable matrass is not attached properly on the turntable so that I demounted and attached very carefully with both-sided tape, which makes the problem a little bit resolved, however basically the problem makes me crazy.<br /><br />I have contacted manufacturer but I do not expect any of positive reply from them since, as longas I understand, the service of NUMARk is well know to be horrible.<br /><br />This morning, I checked about the detail specification of PT01 and realized that the maker does not mention any of \\"wow and flutter\\" term on the specification.  As well known, \\"wow and flutter\\" is the critical specification which guarantee the consistency of the turntable.<br /><br />Usually, turntable makers basically guarantee the consistency of the turntable speed based on the wow and flutter spec., which I thought it is just the common sense, but it unfortunately was not common sense to the NUMARK!!..
B006IDG2T6|5.0|Of any philosophical question, the existence of free will is easily my favorite. Free will, even as an abstract concept, doesn't make sense. No one can possibly describe how a system (whether a human mind, soul, computer, car, toaster...) could conceivably produce the type of volitional action that society commonly assumes we have. Beyond this, certain scientific experiences, using various neural imaging devices, have shown researchers capable of knowing, up to ten seconds before, whether a person will act. Yet, it feels so subjectively true that we do have free will, that if we were able to go back in time, we could have chosen differently, and that, in the present, we are the conscious source of our thoughts and actions. Thus, the discussion over free will represents a very visceral collision between a subjective illusion, and an objective reality.<br /><br />Sam Harris has a new `book' out titled, so descriptively, Free Will. In its very few pages, Sam Harris does a wonderful job of dispelling the arguments commonly trot out to defend a feeble abstract idea. Harris pilfered much of his previous writings for this pamphlet, and if you're familiar with his articles and books, you'll certainly notice this. Yet, the book covers the necessary points without unnecessary digressions into ancillary points, and does so with Harris' characteristic bluntness. If this type of discussion interests you, I highly recommend it. Though, I don't think the book price of $10 justifies the purchase, though the Kindle $4 does.
1741798981|5.0|I have lived and worked in and around London all my life and it is only recently that I have started to fully appreciate what a vibrant and eclectic city is sitting on my doorstep. With this in mind I have purchased numerous London Guides and I quickly ordered the Lonely planet guide when I saw it.<br /><br />I will admit from the start that I am a fan of Lonely Planet guides and this is a particularly fine example of what they can publish when they get the package right. It is colourful, full of stunning images, easy to decipher maps and chock full of insightful tips to help you get the most from your time in London, whether it be a day trip (like I tend to do) or a longer vacation.<br /><br />This has a London Top 16 section and I have to say I generally agree with the choices the publishers have made. If you do these 16 things alone you will have a decent taste of what London can offer. This includes museums, parks, markets and pubs.<br /><br />This book also guides you around the various regions of the city and has an extended section to cover the east, which is especially useful in this Olympic year. This has a fascinating historical section at the back, as well as the usual guide book info on currency, electricity, opening hours etc. There is also plenty of info on the best places to eat, see live entertainment and stay.<br /><br />From a Londoner's point of view I can say this is an excellent guide book to help you get the most from your trip to the capital. It makes for interesting reading for natives who want to learn more and get more from their city, as well as for visitors who want to know some of the background and key highlights before they arrive. London is such a varied city and this guide goes some way to unlocking it's delights for you. I have some rather bland Lonely planet guides in my collection, but thankfully this isn't one of them and it would make a worthy addition to anyone's travel guide bookshelf.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.which can be found on my profile page.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Despite a number of flaws, the story is engaging and enjoyable beyond what those missteps would normally mean for my experience. And, the book's about children killing one another, so I have to cut it some slack.<br /><br />Katniss, the book's 16 year old protagonist, lives in the future years after some ill-defined catastrophe devastated North America and eventually led one city, the Capitol, to consolidate all control in its hands. Surrounding this grotesque totalitarian regime, 12 Districts divide the responsibilities of providing the Capitol with everything needed for a hedonistic existence, including entertainment. This tributary entertainment comes in the form of a 12-18 year old boy and girl from each district, all of whom compete in a televised Battle-Royale-style fight to the death.<br /><br />As a young-adult novel, Susanne Collins presents a very direct, simple story. Consequently, the book is very easy to read, and requires very little reflection on underlying themes or meaning. Considering the book's aims and genre, these are not necessarily flaws. Yet, other choices detract from the experience. First, Collins often unnecessarily slips into clinical expository writing, such as this, taken from the first few pages: \\"But there's also food I you know how to find it. My father knew and he taught me some before he was blown to bits in a mine explosion. There was nothing even to bury. I was eleven then. Five years later, I still wake up screaming for him to run.\\" OK, your father (whom Katniss has not been mentioned before) taught you your trademark hunting abilities, he's dead, you're sixteen, you're sad. Got it. Second, the rational for the Hunger Games and the budding love story are both quite contrived.<br /><br />The book is entertaining and engaging in the same way as a good action movie. If you're looking for such a book, you've found it.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|awesome game over all and i do understand why you guys ares complaining about the price its in HD and is better than all the other games so just stop complaining!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0062119044|5.0|Okay, first of all this book definitely WILL NOT be everyone's cup of tea. I tend to like books with crazy people in them, like [[ASIN:0679735771 American Psycho]] and I love true crime books so I really ended up enjoying this one.<br /><br />As a Turkish-American, I was initially pleased to see that even though the main character, Eva, is Armenian, the author kept the genocide talk to a minimum because it's something that I feel horrible about. (But thinking about it now, I honestly would have liked to hear more about it, especially from Eva's point of view. She didn't really seem to have an opinion about it, she was so factual and detached, like 'Oh, 1.5 mil of my people died, oh well.' *shrug* But then again, this is maybe just one more subtle symptom to show us the readers that Eva isn't really 'all there' herself. She's very detached.)<br /><br />I think to truly enjoy this book, one shouldn't read it with the intention of being shocked and horrified by the spectacle that is Kevin but to read it from the point of view of just listening to Eva and getting into her head. She is such an interesting character! I think the author did an amazing job breathing life into her!<br /><br />I listened to this as an audio book and the reader is phenomenal, 5 stars to her! I especially loved how she did Kevin's voice, it was so funny I kept chuckling and laughing out loud! Especially when Kevin keeps imitating Eva with his nyuh-nyuh-nyuhs!<br /><br />I ended up reading this book because I saw the movie with (legendary goddess) Tilda Swinton in it. Like I said, the book isn't for everyone, but you might want to watch the movie first if you feel iffy about the subject matter.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|This review is based on my 9 year olds opinion. She says it was  funny and one of the best movies she has seen in awhile. The cameos were pretty good also and Jack Black is always funny in our opinion. The musical portion was a surprise which we enjoyed.

B007MNV5WU|4.0|This version of Angry Birds is not unlike the others. The main difference is that now there is a gravity gimmick. So instead of launching birds in high arcs, you can slingshot them around planets and moons. Other than that, though, the game is basically the same ol' stuff. But that's not necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />I have not played the free/standard versions of this game, so I don't know how they compare graphically. Based on previous Angry Birds games, I'd say you probably won't notice a difference, especially on a phone.<br /><br />In any case, the game is still Angry Birds, so if that's what you want, that's what you'll get.

B006BG7RI0|5.0|Reviews on Amazon.com can be confusing as they lump reviews for the same movie on every format and version so you have folks complaining about quality next to those doing leaps for joy!  To be clear I just picked up the new Ultimate 70th anniversary box set ahead of release date...and the review that follows is for this edition to help others like myself who may have one or all of the previous editions decide if in this economic crunch dipping into the wallet again is worth it. I rushed to write this figuring at $44 on Amazon.com the price is low now and I'm trying to help those \\"on the fence\\" as it were.<br /><br />The movie itself needs no review... its in most peoples top 10 list of all time classics and the volumes of extra features and commentaries are for the most part re-purposed from earlier releases (and spelled out elsewhere so I will not be redundant in listing them) but that isn't always the case with re-issues and I know as I have many duplicate movies because a newer version doesn't contain the featurette or commentary from an inferior previous edition print quality wise... so Kudos to WB for making all previous editions expendable from that standpoint...<br /><br />so... WHAT is different, and is it worth your money?<br />the two featurettes that ARE new ..I appreciate a lot. Michael Curtiz is without a doubt one of the greatest directors ever with an early run of classics with Errol Flynn (Captain Blood, The Sea Hawk, Robin Hood, The Charge of the light Brigade and more) to Casablanca, Yankee Doodle Dandy , Mildred Pierce and even White Christmas just for starters in his resume and it great to have something on him finally. To answer the 64k dollar question YES...the image quality on the new blu-ray is noticeably improved and I'm not even a guy with a massively expensive home theater system and I was blown away by the rich blacks and overall just the brilliant and staggeringly beautiful black and white film I was enjoying..seemingly for the first time at moments.<br /><br />I picked mine up for a bit over 50 bucks and consider it a deal.<br /><br />If you don't really care about Michael Curtiz or a better picture...the old Blu Ray set or even single blu ray disc will be fine for many... but if you are a film fan and a fan of glorious Black & White with lovely play between shadows and light....don't miss it!<br /><br />UPDATE!!  I just found a single disc version of this as an exclusive at Target for only $14.99!!!  Its the same first disc as this set with the two new documentaries...a bunch of the older ones AND the newly upgraded video for a fraction of the price ...so if you don't want the book and the box and the extra DVD ....THIS IS A DEAL. I think had I seen it first I'd skip the box!!!!  Hope this helps...
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I'm really enjoying this album.  It definitely has a lot of emotional and visual imagery.  It pretty much tracks the experiences of a popular, disturbed, pretty, socially adept, experienced American girl.  So it will bring you back to your teenage years.  It also has good production and vocals.  I like how she plays with different vocals styles (high pitched, sultry lows, and Britney pop).  You can tell she has put a lot of work into this.

B004O0VAVA|1.0|I'm commenting after downloading this book in February 2012, so I don't know if changes were made between some of the earlier reviews and when I saw it -- if so, they seem to have been changes for the worse.  I was encouraged to buy this edition because of the advertised \\"apocryphal\\" or hard-to-find plays, not sure I had them in my grandmother's hardcover edition of Shakespeare.<br /><br />The problems start with the \\"quick-linking table of contents\\", which is, in fact, almost useless. It refers to each play by the words \\"the end\\" which are printed above the title to signify the conclusion of the previous work, and then proceeds to create an index point for any page where a capitalized heading was found.  The play's actual title may or may not also have been indexed.  For example, one index point is labeled A COURTEZAN, which happens to be a capitalized stand-alone line in the Dramatis Personae for \\"A Comedy of Errors\\".  I started to create a key for the table of contents in a Word document for my own use, but it is almost not worth the trouble.<br /><br />There are various places where headings are printed twice in succession in the text of the play, such as PROLOGUE PROLOGUE for the Prologue of the \\"Life of King Henry V\\".  These repeats are not in any hardcover text - why are they in this Kindle edition?<br /><br />I have not been able to read the plays yet because I am so distracted and put off by these flaws that many people might consider minor, but which really detract from the readibility of the text.  I will look around -- perhaps another publisher has done a better job.
B005SAP45I|5.0|My little boy LOVES this movie and I think it was a great sequal to the first!  It made the decision to purchase the Blu-Ray version so much easier!
0545265355|4.0|I bought the trilogy set for my Kindle.  It took me three night to read, one night per book. That happens to be my biggest complaint.  The three books could have been written as one big book.  She almost dumbs down the books for a younger audience.  Let me prove my point.  The harry potter box set for all seven books is rated for ages 9+, and the last four books are almost as big as all three of the hunger game books combined.  The Inheritance Cycle books are the same age recommendation as as the Hunger Game books and they are much longer as well.<br /><br />That reason alone is why I am rating it 4/5 stars.  If it was one big book, it would be a perfect 5/5.<br /><br />I love her writing style, a first person view of Katniss.  It is almost like a running inner monologue.  I love it.  It really works for these books, as Katniss doesn't know what others are thinking and how she feels about it.<br /><br />I have to say, of the three books, book one was my favorite.  But, the tone of the books changed.  In book one it was about a teen fighting for her life, and WANTING to live.  In book to the tone really changes to a girl knowing she is going to die, embracing it, and moving forward.  Book three Katniss is so lost she doesn't have anything on her mind but one goal.  She is almost lost, questioning herself, doubting.<br /><br /><<WARNING MINOR PLOT SPOILERS, BUT NOTHING SERIOUS>><br /><br />There are some moments that where quite shocking, not just how they happened, but when they happened.  Rue's death, for one.  I really wanted that character expanded much more in the book.<br /><br />I hated the ended of Mockingjay.  What I would have loved to see expanded into a chapter in itself, was condensed into a couple of pages.  There are many questions that I wanted answered.  I wanted to know how some of those that I fell in love with (other than Katniss) continued on.  It is a resolution, of a sort, but not one I am happy with in any way.  The world of the Hunger Games Trilogy was brought to life so vividly, and I really wanted to know how much has REALLY changed.  But those are minor squabbles.

B0050DIWFC|3.0|This book was selected for our reading group, and it was a great book to have an open discussion about.  Those of us with pre teens and teens were able to relate to the social media references.  There were some great twists and surprises, but I feel that the characters could have been developed better and with greater detail.

B004UHSB5A|5.0|I downloaded this game about a month ago and it has become my go-to game. The interface is well organized and an update made this weekend improved it even further. There are always many people online to play with. The multiplayer system connects people quickly and doesn't require unnecessary registration. You do have the ability to tie your device to an email address so you can move the account to another device if you wish, but I've yet to use that feature. I do also have a tablet, so if I was going to say anything critical - I wish I was able to access my account seamlessly from both devices. It seems I could transfer back and forth through account recovery, but given how easy everything else in the game is, that feels like too much work. All told, I have not found a better dominoes app on android; enjoy.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This case is perfect for me.  It is light, and it protects my Kindle Fire with no worries.

It appears it will last the long term in that moving parts are designed so that nothing will split or break over time.  I really find no faults with this case.

B004A8ZWSS|4.0|This is a fun, under-appreciated movie. If you like \\"caper\\" films such as \\"Charade,\\"  \\"It Takes a Thief,\\" or \\"How to Steal a Million,\\" with stars Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Peter O'Toole, and Cary Grant; this is a film you'll probably enjoy. If you're hoping to see Angeline Jolie in a bodysuit, kicking butt with a flamboyant Jack Sparrow, you're going to be disappointed. Depp is known for tackling a wide range of roles, from Edward Scissorhands to Don Juan de Marco. In this film, he verges on being a dweeb, complete with a full set of pajamas--the kind men used to wear--with nary a chest hair in sight. Nevertheless, Depp's self-deprecating Frank Tupelo never seems ridiculous; rather he seems like a man caught up in an adventure he could only have imagined happening to someone else. Frank may not be suave and debonair, but he's resourceful and funny; traits that keep us, and Jolie's character, Elise, from writing him off too quickly. Although Jolie is convincingly enigmatic and glamorous, her performance is not as nuanced as that of Depp. We catch hints of emotional depths, but they remain hints. We never really understand what makes her tick. The rest of the film is solid: there is a good supporting cast, the costumes are spot-on, and the photography of Venice makes you want to catch the nearest plane for Italy. This movie was a very pleasant change from films that bombard you with special effects or scenes of graphic sex and/or violence in order to keep your attention. And if you can avoid typecasting the two leads based on previous roles, you may decide, as I did, that \\"The Tourist\\" is a gem that deserves to be discovered.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|i love this game it s the best game ever i sit down and play for hours because it is so addicting
014240165X|5.0|This is a reprint of the first book in what now is a sort of lengthy and very popular series following the exploits of Alex Rider, a young man (14) who is recruited by the British Intelligence  Service to take his murdered spy uncle's place.  The reader should keep in mind that these books are targeted toward pre-teens and I personally cannot put them into the category of YA.  This book is not what you would call complex and most certainly cannot in any way be identified with \\"high literature.\\"  Of course it was not meant to be complex or meant to be a literary diamond.  No, it was meant to appeal to preteen boys and I suspect that it is a book that was meant to lure in those who may be reluctant readers.  For what it was created for, it does an excellent job.<br /><br />When you think of Alex Rider think of a 14 year old James Bond.  Alex has skills and training (Due to his deceased spy uncle who raised him) that a normal 14 year old young man would not have.  (More about that later).  The plot is simple...good guys versus bad guys; good kid versus evil guy.  The action is swift and there are very few chapters or pages that are not filled with it.<br /><br />Now there are some things to note about this work.  (I am writing this from the viewpoint of a old; very old, adult).<br /><br />There is violence in this work but the violence is NOT overly graphic in anyway.  There was actually more graphic violence in books such as \\"The Hobbit,\\" but violence there is.  I felt the author handled this quite well.<br /><br />There is little to no bad language in this work.  I think I detected one or two words such as \\"hell\\" but they were few and far between and in no way gratuitous.  Trust me folks when I tell you that your preteen kids hears far, far, far worse on a daily basis from his or her peers.<br /><br />The hero, Alex Rider, posses wonderful skills.  Now it is important to note there that these skills ARE NOT above the head of a normal, intelligent kids who is willing to actually work hard.  The knowledge of a couple or three foreign languages in not above the reach of a 14 year old.  If you journey outside of our country, you will find any number of kids who are quite fluent in three our four languages.  Being good or an expert at karate is most certainly doable...it just takes hard work.  Being familiar with computers and various electronic devices...well, talk you your average Jr. High boy or girl and you will probably find that they are quite well versed in these subjects already.  History, math, science...all doable on the level of Alex.  The point here is that the hero of this book can act as an inspiration and motivator for this age of child.  I well remember reading the old work \\"Have Spacesuit Will Travel\\" at 13 or 14...folks, that little SiFi book rather change my life in many ways.<br /><br />The reading level here is not all that high and with a bit of effort I feel that most kids of this age can handle it.  That being said, the author has used enough advanced vocabulary and used it in a way that  will challenge most young readers without discouraging them.  This to me is a good thing.<br /><br />The book is a true page turner in every sense of the word.  As an adult I found myself captivated with the story despite the somewhat (via an adults eyes) weak plot.  Never mind the naysayers here that whine about poor character development...trust me, your kid will careless about this aspect of the work.  For goodness sakes, this IS NOT an adult book!<br /><br />One weakness I found in the book, as did several other reviewers, is the lack of any strong female characters.  I realize that any given book cannot address all the issues that need to be addressed, but I feel the author could have thrown in at least one.  In this case he had a golden opportunity with the young lady charged with taking care of Alex after his uncle was murdered.  Oh well, maybe future books will take care of that.<br /><br />The book can be and is quite humorous at times...this is a nice break from the action.<br /><br />I liked this work and plan to read the rest of the series.  After talking with our local public and school librarian I found that this entire series is extremely popular with the Jr. High kids.  If the kids are reading, then that is a big plus in my book.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarkste humorous at times...this is a nice break from the action.<br /><br />I liked this work and plan to read the rest of the series.

0385344228|1.0|Another reviewer has lauded the author for \\"expos[ing] the corruption in our legal system.\\"  Yet there is absolutely nothing in the author's description of our legal system that is remotely accurate!  This is exactly why prosecutors like myself hate to see the public swallow this portrayal hook, line and sinker and, yet, it is NOT REAL!  First and foremost, there is no way that any local prosecutor's office would be handling the murder trial of the son of one of its own.  It is a conflict!  But there are other examples of this idiocy.  Andy tells his lead investigator to go back and interrogate their first suspect after he had already asked where his lawyer was. Any first-year law student knows that after a suspect asks for his lawyer, you can't go back and interrogate him again.  It actually violates a little thing known as the U.S. Constitution.  And the errors are not only legal ones.  I should have stopped reading this book when AFTER paying a shiva call, Andy laments tht the poor victim's body was still in \\"a refrigerated drawer in the M.E.'s office.\\"  Yes, that should have been my first clue but I read on.  I'm now at about 20% on my Kindle and I want my money back!  There's only so much of my disbelief that I can suspend.

My ONLY complaint, other than the few \\"unrealistic\\" relationship situations, is that the author overkills the usage of certain words and phrases.

1553655427|2.0|\\"Dead Aid\\" by Dambisa Moyo is an unfortunate case of a provocative, important thesis, that foreign aid to Africa isn't working, and beating it to death through exaggeration and misattribution. Reading this book would make one think that Africa would be developed and peaceful, if only Westerners weren't trying to help it. That is foolish at best, dangerous at worse. Even worse, it once again puts the nations of Sub-Saharan Africa in the position of victims, a characterization I'm sure at which the author would bristle.<br /><br />Moyo certainly has credibility: She is an actual African arguing against foreign aid. With a resume that includes Goldman Sachs, she has the resume to speak about such matters. Beware, however: African elites, of which she is certainly a member, have very different perspectives from the people who receive the aid she condemns. Regardless of how Africa itself develops, families like Moyo's will do well. Read \\"The White Man's Burden\\" by William Easterly for a better critique of the failings of aid.

038533348X|1.0|This review will likely spoil parts of the plot.  I'll try and keep those to a minimum, but you've been warned.<br /><br />My English teacher once called this book a \\"science-fiction\\" novel, and that was the first red flag I should have noticed.  Science-fiction, in a literature class?  What English teacher would allow such a thing?  I thought they despised books that focused on ideas instead of character!<br /><br />I soon learned that I had misread them entirely.  It's not the focus on ideas that turns English majors off--it's optimism, and a sense that science and technology empower humanity and allow a brighter future.  That's why \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is a book that they endorse.  It goes beyond mere pessimism and dives into the abyss of nihilism.<br /><br />From Kurt Vonnegut, we learn that science and technology will be the death of us all, that the military-industrial complex is a force that will develop any weapon for its own sake without regard for the consequences, and that the purpose of religion is to provide comforting lies.<br /><br />These ideas are delivered through two plot devices--a substance called Ice-9, which converts water into solid form at room temperature, and an ideology called Bokononism.  The former eventually--spoiler--kills almost all the world's population, and is supposed to be a parody of the atomic bomb.  The latter is a religion whose adherants tell each other comforting lies.  Leaving aside that doublethink is necessary for a lie to be comforting if the recipient of the lie is aware of its lack of truth, Bokononism fails as a parody of Christianity--Vonnegut's target--because the whole point of Christianity is that the adherants believe their ideology to be the truth!  If an ideology is accepted to be a lie, why would anyone follow it?  It is also an inherantly ugly ideology in that it provides no reason for one to exist.  Even Marxism has some sort of bright ideal at the end of it to motivate its followers--Bokononism has nothing going for it.<br /><br />As for Ice-9, its inherant flaw as a satirical concept is that it is a parody of a phenomenon that doesn't exist.  The military-industrial complex would not develop an obviously self-destructive device--the fact that there are no Cobalt Bombs should be evidence enough of that.  Before anyone counters this point with the Atomic and Hydrogen bombs, an atomic war is not inherantly a civilization-ending event.  They're just big explosives in a small package--humanity no more can wipe itself and the earth's biosphere out with them than it can alter the earth's orbital path.  Ice-9 is a wholly different concept, a device that can freeze all liquid water on earth, and, if one thinks on timescales of trillions of years, perhaps the entire galaxy.  Its use in battle would inherantly destroy the one who wields it.  There is no reason that any power would develop it.<br /><br />Another flaw in this book is its lack of memorable characters.  A character can be judged on his or her strength by how well one can remember them.  Some authors write truly memorable characters--Allen Steele's William Tucker in \\"A King of Infinite Space,\\" Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle's Allen Carpentier in \\"Inferno,\\" Henryk Sienkiewicz's entire cast of main characters in his Trilogy, to name but a few.  In \\"Cat's Cradle,\\" the only characters I can remember are that one midget (because I thought maybe the word \\"midget\\" was the source of that legendary Vonnegut humor) and the woman from Indiana who wants people to whom she is not related to call her \\"mom\\" (I remember her only because I tried to figure out what her mental disorder was for a while).<br /><br />Bottom Line: The book's messages are that Science is Bad and Religion is Lies.  If you believe that either of these statements are false, you'd be better off with just about any other writer (Arthur C. Clarke, Robert Heinlein, Jules Verne, if you're into Science Fiction.  Otherwise, I can recommend Henryk Sienkiewicz).  If youare an English major, this might be the book for you.  It's depressing, cynical, and all the other things that make for those excessively-long papers that English professors love.
B004H8GLXQ|4.0|Beautifully written, engaging and interesting characters, suspenseful, shocking, and sometimes heartbreaking. What more could one ask of a book? When I finished the book, I felt at once fulfilled and sad.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Read the book and was not as excited as most.<br /><br />Then, saw the movie.  What a wonderful experience.<br /><br />Every actor and actress performed exceptionally and delivered a most poignant, informational and inspiring story.<br /><br />On the verge of tears that were many times shed, I grew to love the ladies of 'The Help' and admired their courage and fortitude.  Abileen, Mimi, Skeeter...the list goes on.<br /><br />Believe that no matter how much we 'think' we know about civil rights and how they are appropriated ... this movie sheds more light on understanding.<br /><br />Ladies of courage, so many in this movie...it was an outstanding film!
B000002PCS|5.0|\\"Somewhere in Time\\" is a great love story, and the John Barry score makes it all the more memorable.  The title theme song is hauntingly beautiful.
B004LL1HM4|3.0|I've listened to this album several times now and here are my thoughts:<br /><br />Alright if not great album, this one. It's got a kind of 60's psychedelic folk-rock think going on and will bring to mind acts like Simon & Garfunkel, but with a big stadium sound. Not many of the songs stand out or are memorable, but it's all quite pleasant to listen to. My only real gripe is that there's not enough dynamic variety for me, so it's a bit hard to digest it all in one go. There should be a mix of quieter songs and loud songs, but on this album the songs kind of all run together and it gets pretty samey. Overall I find this a bit dull.
B001GCUO1Q|1.0|There where tons of horrible things about this film,but only one really angered me. In the very begging of the movie a subtitle came up to reveal the year being 1970. The charter Logan is ten years old a few minutes later in the movies montage a clip is show of Logan as an adult fighting in the civil war. The civil war ended in 1963- it is impossible for Logan to fight in a war that already ended.

B0068FYZLG|5.0|Billy Elliot is definitely one of my favorite movies--another reviewer asked, \\"What's not to like?\\"  My answer to that: nothing.  Unless, of course, it makes you uncomfortable to watch a young boy dance or witness his best friend growing into his homosexuality.  ;)<br />This movie is a wonderful coming-of-age story about a boy from a working class family who realizes that his dream is to dance, despite his brother's and his father's wishes.  Billy Elliot has it's funny, awkward, and uncomfortable moments, but overall it is absolutely heart-warming tale about a young man and the family dynamics that play into him chasing his dreams.

B0073IGGCI|5.0|We recently watched the first episode after hearing so many of my friends talking about how good the series are. I must say we were hooked instantly and once we caught up with the series, we haven't missed an episode yet. The stories are so original, creative and enchanting. I am really enjoying watching the different versions of the fairy tales we all grew up with. I particularly liked Little Red Riding Hood's- I definitely did not see that one coming.<br />All the actors do an amazing job in their portrayals of the different characters. I really enjoy the evil queen/ Regina Mills played Lana Parrilla and Rumpelstilskin/Mr. Gold played by Robert Carlyle. Ginnifer Goodwin is fantastic as Snow white/Mary Margaret! It is a must see!

B006WWTKQ0|4.0|Before I write my review, I should point out the the reason this movie has such a disproportionate number of 1-star reviews is because blogger Mike Mozart orchestrated a protest in support of killing the overreaching SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act) and PIPA (Protect IP Act) bills that were introduced by Representative Lamar S. Smith (R-TX) and Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), respectively in 2011. Not sure anyone seeing those reviews will connect the dots and realize that all those 1-star reviews have nothing to do with Happy Feet 2, and it's a shame this movie was targeted. Glad SOPA and PIPA were killed, but the collateral damage done to this movie was a real shame.<br /><br />Is it a 5-star movie? No, but it's a 4-star movie for sure. Just the comedy bits with Bill the Krill and Will the Krill are worth it - they have the absolute best lines in the movie. (Example: when Bill and Will leave the \\"swarm,\\" Bill cries, \\"Goodbye, Krill world!\\")<br /><br />If you liked the first Happy Feet movie, you'll like this one almost as much. (Or, if you felt there was too much of an environmental message in the first one, you might like this sequel better since the preaching is toned down significantly.)<br /><br />The music is fun and as professionally performed as the first Happy Feet, and the graphics are stunning. There are a few scenes where real people are inserted, just like in the first move, but they're a lot better integrated than the first film. (The sailor who plays the guitar riffs for \\"We are the Champions\\" is just amazing to watch.)<br /><br />The 2D Blu-ray is flawless with no discernible flaws in the picture, and the sound is just as good. This disc is about as close to reference as you'll get these days.<br /><br />However, the 3D Blu-ray has problems...at least on my television, a Sharp 70\\" Elite (PRO-70X5FD) which is one of the absolute best 3D TV out today. The amount of crosstalk (ghosting) makes the 3D version unwatchable, IMHO. Perhaps other TVs render the 3Dof this disc better, but considering that Avatar, Hubble 3D, Immortals, Hugo, and many other recent 3D Blu-rays look almost flawless on this TV makes me think this 3D disc has an authoring problem. Hopefully other reviewers will chime in to specifically discuss this disc's 3D on their respective TVs to confirm or disprove that this is a problem.<br /><br />One last note - for those of you who hate that Blu-rays from Amazon.com still come with hard-to-remove stickers on the outer slip cases, this disc is no different. However, because of the more resilient holographic cover on the slip case, the stickers come off a little easier than they would on a matte slip case.
B007O6R1MI|5.0|This season has taken a nose-dive for the most part, which has been really disappointing for me as a hard-core, die-hard Supernatural fan since season one. The infrequency of episodes this season has been killer. So far, the storyline has been randomly meandering all over the spectrum, from big bad Leviathans to a bore of an episode entirely on cast-off cursed objects. So far the writers have blundered through, all without really developing the story. When they killed off both Cass AND Bobby, it really lost vital character elements. I say fire whoever has been shipwrecking this season, and let whomever took the wheel on this episode take over!!! Sad as it is to say, this sub-par episode has been one of the better ones for this season. Sam manages to save a fellow (hot) female patient, even while in a Lucifer-driven state of insanity. Dean searches for a mysterious healer to help Sam, instead discovering his once-best friend and one-time greatest betrayor: the fallen angel Castiel. Throw in the demon Meg, some amnesia, and a re-entry of demon intervention, and you've got the best supernatural episode in weeks.
1400069289|5.0|This was an outstanding book on an important topic. Habits are integral to everything we do and are the basic building blocks of success and failure in virtually every aspect of our lives.<br /><br />The author does a great job illustrating how habits can transform lives, companies and even societies though incredibly engaing and interesting stories. The examples and stories not only made it a particularly enjoyable read but was also a particularly effective way to convey the author's points.<br /><br />Given broad applicability of this book, I think virtually any adult looking to improve their effectiveness through better habits would find this book useful. I'd say its particularly useful for those with a business focus as well.
B000NHQZ1S|2.0|As other reviews have stated the cast is great and the acting is really good.  But this film suffers from an unfulfilled script.  There could have been so much more developed with the characters, plot, and lack of a climax.  At the end of the movie not a whole lot has changed and the script ends where it should have been about 2/3 of the way through the film.<br /><br />If you are in to indie flicks that pull this type of half hearted attempt at a plot all the time by all means check it out for AAA acting but I can't give these kinds of scripts a free pass especially when it could have been a really memorable flick.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />acting great<br />story solid and interesting<br />script is a suck with slow development and very little in the way of climax<br />pretty piss poor ending

B002G1YPH0|3.0|I recently switched to this from the Corsair H60 self-contained water cooler to this because the Corsair kept getting air bubbles and making noise due to the way it was oriented in my case (Silverstone FT02).<br /><br />First, the good: this thing is an excellent value. The cooling per dollar ratio is just great. After 30 minutes of Prime95, my i7-2600k @ 4.4Ghz runs about 70c on the hottest core, which is around 5 degrees warmer than the H60. However, this was 1/2 or 1/3 the price and in day-to-day use (like playing and streaming Starcraft 2 at 1080p resolution), none of the cores go above 58c, which is totally acceptable to me.<br /><br />However, there are a couple of downsides to this cooler that prevent it from being truly great.<br /><br />Most importantly, the installation was the worst I have seen for a custom cooler. Trying to hold the nuts on the underside of the motherboard while screwing in the screws from the top (which also require an adapter to actually screw, which is included) is an enormous pain in the butt. Then, the x-shaped brace that actually holds the cooler to against the CPU is also a pain in the butt. Finally, if you're not careful while un-mounting the cooler you can inadvertently loosen the nuts you worked so hard to secure to the back of the board, which again is a pain in the butt. I recommend not taking this thing off once you put it on if at all possible.<br /><br />Applying thermal compound is also more difficult as the underside is not flat. The instruction manual shows a graphic of just putting a huge glob of paste on the contact plate, but as any experienced builder knows, putting too much thermal paste on will degrade performance. Instead, folks on the web recommend filling in the gaps with paste then applying lines between the heat pipes. Sound confusing? It sure is when compared to a typical thermal paste application. All around this thing was just not pleasant to install.<br /><br />The other negative for this cooler is that the included fan, while effective, is quite loud at full speed. If you're trying to keep a relatively quiet system you're going to want to replace it ASAP. Try a Scythe Gentle Typhoon or a Cougar Vortex for less noise and similar (or better) performance.<br /><br />Finally, the plastic fan mounting rails are fairly cheap -- one of mine cracked near the screw hole when applying it to a new fan (although it still stays put).<br /><br />I know this sounds like a lot of negativity but I think these gripes are acceptable for an aftermarket cooler of this price -- and one that performs quite respectably. However, if I had to do it again I'd probably go with the Evo version for about 10 bucks more. Maximum PC has mentioned Cooler Master greatly improved the mounting hardware and that alone is worth the extra cost to me.he included fan, while effective, is quite loud at full speed.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|Purchased \\"11/22/63\\" based on a friend's recommendation. Found the story line to be a departure from the usual Stephen King genre, very interesting and thought provoking. I had heard some readers found the ending unsatisfactory, but I did not. My only criticism would be the length of the book, which IMHO could have been quite a bit shorter (I thought there was too much reading time spent on the principal character's years in Texas) without detracting from the book as a whole. All in all, a very worthwhile read and I would recommend it to others with only the one reservation above.

B005RYF5JA|5.0|After I watched the PBS special, which I happened to stumble upon, I had to buy the DVD.  It sincerely did not disappoint.  I thought that both the music and the Celtic Woman were incredibly beautiful. I have watched both the PBS version and the DVD version more than a few times.  I BELIEVE there were four songs on the DVD that were not on the PBS special to make up for the PBS breaks.  Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend the concert (They are going to be at the Akron Civic Arena) this month, I BELIEVE.  I will definitely be purchasing the CD.
B001I0T92Q|5.0|Got this adapter and two 16GB Sandisk MicroSD cards, put them into the adapter and formatted on the PSP.  The format was at most a minute long, and afterwards it showed up as 29GB of space.  Had heard of issues of it not fitting in a PSP-1000 very well, but it went in just as well as the old 2GB stick.  Memory card takes a couple seconds to show up when turning on the PSP, but it is a very small inconvinence for the massive space on this thing, very happy to be able to fit my entire collection of music (around 10GB).  Loads games from the stick in a fast manner to boot.
B00004SVID|5.0|Over the years I have liked some of the Pink Floyd music but have never been a great fan; but I have really enjoyed this album.

Looked over to the car next to me and the guy driving was singing along with great gusto to the same track I was listening to..
B0048WQDIE|1.0|I bought this book because of all the \\"good\\" reviews it recieved.  I am always interested when an author's work trancends it own era, there by being relevant at anytime in the future.  However, this is not one of those.  Aside from the obsurd and unbelievable situation Yosarrian is in, the book was, in a word....MONOTONOUS!  It is not the amount of characters, nor the repetative back story of each character that Heller takes every opportunity tell us, but it is more the repetive, cliche' discussions that yossarian has with just about every character he come across.  It goes like this, \\"Your crazy.  No I am not.  Maybe I am.  Maybe you are too becuase you are here and you think I am crazy.  Oh yeah, maybe I am crazy too, blah blah blah.\\"  I really wish I would have spent the money on cookbook instead, or really anything other than this.  If you can find this book at a garage sale, do not pay more than a quarter for it.<br />But..<br />If you like unbelievable war stories, long drawn out repetative character back stories, shallow dialog, and no real point, then this book is for you!

B003EYVXV4|5.0|** This review contains spoilers for the book and the movie. **<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen lives in poverty stricken District 12 with her sister Primrose and her mother. The Reaping is approaching fast and Primrose is frightened she will be chosen even though it will be the first time her name is in the drawing. When Prim's name is called, Katniss volunteers as tribute to take part in the Hunger Games, where 2 young people (boy and girl, aged 12 to 18) from each of the 12 districts fight to the death for prestige and goods for their district. Only one victor survives. Katniss is plunged into a completely different world where being memorable and likeable will mean her survival. She will do what it takes to survive, but will it be enough?<br /><br />I read The Hunger Games a couple of years ago and it was never my favorite in the series. I felt it was a Battle Royale ripoff and the later books explored the dystopic world better and went beyond the obvious comparisons between the two works. This film made me forget all that. I was completely blown away and I really want to watch it about 20 more times. I haven't felt like this about a movie in a really long time. The ensemble cast was amazing, giving believable portrayal of characters I feel I know very well after reading 3 books about them. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen acted wonderfully. She always had an air of sadness yet responsibility. She made the tough heroine believable and relatable because her emotions were close beneath the surface despite her hard exterior. Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket provided much needed humor that alleviated the emotion and drama of the story. The other most notable actors were Woody Harrelson as Haymitch (more comic relief and makes Katniss realize the gravity of the reality TV aspect) and Isabel Fuhrman as Clove (sociopath and career tribute that left me with a chill every time she was onscreen).<br /><br />This film did 3 things extremely well that made it one of the best book to film transitions I've ever seen: capturing the emotions, humanizing the otherwise unlikeable characters, and working out timing. Two scenes in particular were very emotional for me.  The scene where Katniss volunteers as tribute for her sister was absolutely heartwrenching even though I had seen at least some of the scene hundreds of times in the past month from the commercials. The other scene that made me bawl like a baby was when Rue died. It was so sudden it took me a few moments for her death to process. I had cried at the scene in the book, but it's different seeing it on the screen. It was captured perfectly and there wasn't a dry eye in my theater. The other tributes were well humanized despite being portrayed as villains, especially the career tributes. Marvel at the end made a speech about how even he won he would be doomed because the Games are all he was good for. It showed that the other tributes aren't the real villains; President Snow and all those that perpetuate these sadistic Games are. I was surprised at how well the film flowed from scene to scene. About half of the film was dedicated to portraying the world, the assessing of the tributes, and the reality television aspect of the Games. The Games took up the latter half. I was never bored and I never thought any of the scenes ran too long. Although every single scene of the book wasn't included in the film, the essential scenes were preserved and given a satisfying amount of time.<br /><br />The most important triumph of this film was that I was never distracted by analyzing each and every difference from the novel. I was completely immersed in the cruel and depressing world of The Hunger Games and wondered at the characters' capacity for hope in the face of a bleak totalitarian regime. The only drawback at all was the shaky cam got a little extreme at points. Usually I'm against it on principle, but it let the film keep a gritty edge without pushing the boundaries into rated R territory by showing graphic scenes of children killing each other. I did not consider this book the best in the series and this movie was simply amazing. I can't wait to see what great films will be made of Catching Fire and Mockingjay.
B005LAIGZU|1.0|I'm a Vietnam-era ex-Marine Corps sergeant. I don't have any criticism about Navy SEALS and I think SEALS are fantastically heroic. My complaint is the idea or premise that Chechens would attack the U.S. Since the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, Chechnya, a tiny state, has been fighting to get its independence from Russia. Putin has painted Chechens as international terrorists solely so he could brutally smash them without Free World interference. For an example, google 'Grozny' and see how Putin's air force and artillery have obliterated Chechnya's once-cosmopolitan capital city. Putin has terrorized the entire Chechen nation and had assasssinated any human rights activists who tried to expose him, e.g. google Anna Politovskaya, et al. The biggest problem with this film is pulp Hollywood writers/producers who don't do  their terrorist homework and spread Putin's propaganda.
B004LE7PCM|4.0|Was really happy to find a good collection of Sherlock Holmes books. I can't vouch for the completeness but it certainly is a big collection. I dived right in after buying it and still have only scratched the service. The formatting is a little poor in places which is why I didn't give 5 stars. Sherlock himself is not what I expected exactly. You do have to take into account the time when these were written. There is some olde English which is great - just enough to be authentic but not enough to hide the meaning. Doyle created a great formula for mystery stories. It's not what you would expect from a modern thriller but it's still create story telling. Oh and if you're interested in the Moriarty character like I was, just to say he doesn't appear much - he was kind of built up to be more of a central figure in more modern versions of the Holmes stories. Still, a great collection, good work!

B0068FYZCA|4.0|I will start off by saying I really love this movie. That being said this is really a great deal to have 3 different versions of the film available.<br /><br />On the downside, the picture quality is disappointing. I understand the film is almost 40 years old but it's really easy to tell Universal didn't do much to restore/correct it but simply upscaled the DVD version to a better resolution. Overall the picture is more clear and you can see things (actor's acne, storefront signs) more clear than in previous versions but there is a LOT of digital noise and film grain present throughout the film. On the plus-side the audio seems to have been tweaked a bit so the soundtrack and dialogue sounds great.<br /><br />I give it 4 stars because the film is great, having a digital copy is awesome, and the price is amazingly reasonable.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a great read! I think that it is a great insight into how those in power may view keeping order among the masses. If nothing else, this was a study into the nature of humanity. I must say though, the true enjoyment is in the author's ability to describe the surroundings and people in a way that makes you feel you are experiencing everything first hand. I am a huge fan of the author now. He can draw me into the book, and I don't want to put it down. This is the first review I have ever given, and it is because I felt compelled to let the author and others know that I enjoyed this book immensely. I will look forward to reading other books by him.
B003EYVXV4|3.0|....and that's what I got.<br /><br />I cherished the book and I know it's hard to translate 12 hours of reading into 2.5 hours of movie. I suppose I could say that they tried but if you read the book, then the movie was disappointing. If you didn't read the book, I bet you will be baffled.<br /><br />I just got home from the film. I'm going to take a Xanax and go to bed.
B002IFT1ZA|1.0|I purchased the Game of Thrones First Season. This film is poorly written and directed. The characters are generally cold. The characters in the story need more development to make it interesting. I am guessing that it is a film which is supposed to be an epic similar to Lord of the Rings. The producers of this film spent more time on very graphic violence, many scenes of very vulgar sexual acts, and the entire movie represents a cynical way of looking at life. For the money spent making this movie, it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I imagine that the creators of the movie had no respect for their audience, assumed that they were stupid and need violence and sex to pay attention to the movie.<br /><br />I have seen movies with sex and violence in them before before, but this one is really overdone and it does not work to make the story connect.<br /><br />The first season ends, which I am assuming is a cliff-hanger. The story ends without conclusion. One of the queens immolates herself and survives bearing dragon children. I am guessing that they will be unleashed in the conquest of the throne. There should not be a season two, judging by season one. If you like character and story, you will not like this film. If you like sex and violence, you can find better films. If you just want intoxicate yourself in a bar and see a brawl, this movie is for you.

B0032KNA4I|3.0|This is a fun movie by the same producers that brought you \\"Independence Day\\", so you know what you are getting into:  cheesy plot, predictable characters, very conservative black-and-white morality...  but you will have a good time with it.  It is also one of the few movies that I would recommend to watch strictly on Blu-ray, since the detailed disaster special effects can only be seen on HD, and they are worth a look.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|I love this game sooooooo cool :D. Very interesting. Needs more levels. Its worth the money but my dad got it free somehow...
B004A8ZWSS|2.0|If you want to see the good version of this movie watch Anthony Zimmer, the French version which by far excels this one. It has a story with believable characters played by Sophie Marceau & Yves Attal & is filmed in Nice as opposed to Venice. It has action, mystery & romance, all the elements missing from The Tourist. I love Johnny Depp but he had no personality, Angelina Jolie reminded me of Jessica Rabbit (Who killed Roger Rabbit?) whenever she walked anywhere with all the mouths dropping open & everything coming to a halt. Where was the chemistry? There was none. I know she can act, take her performance in Salt, she still looked beautiful but the character she was playing was convincing.<br />This movie was empty, there was a beginning & end but no middle.
B003PTP4S6|5.0|One of my favorite music sets.  Two masters of their own domain collaborate together in an increadible audio journey to change the past.  They take several pieces of music that had nothing to do with the cello and create something brand new without loosing the soul of the original piece.  If you are a fan of Yo-Yo Ma or Ennio, by the end of listening you will become a fan of both!

B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was riveting in its indepth look at an adolescent boy and his parents and how they deal with crisis in their lives.  Jacob is accused of murdering one of his classmates who was bullying him.  The book is mostly about the trial, or is it?  I was very surprised at the ending.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this games is the greatest games ever to be manmade I love it really I do okay everybody I love it
0439023513|1.0|Some might tote the ending as \\"realistic\\" but in my view \\"realistic\\" isn't an excuse for bad storytelling. Many events of the story weren't realistic; they were extreme, dramatic, and required some suspension of disbelief. You can't have this over-the-top plot 3/4 of the way through and then suddenly change tack to what's \\"realistic\\" and expect everyone to buy it.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />Was Katniss a meaningful character in the end? Did she use her position to help ensure Panem's new government is better than the one the rebellion toppled so that all those who died, died for something worthwhile? No, the author killed Prim in a horribly contrived situation that required quite a lot of suspension of disbelief so she could take Katniss  right back to her lowest point before the story began (after her father died) and left her that way forever and ever for the sole purpose of providing a reason for her to need Peeta. Really, I feel like my time was wasted. I'm angry that in the end Katniss didn't have any connection to the bigger story - rebuilding the country. She didn't have to be any less broken or damaged or forever changed to do that - look at her mother, with the hospital at the end. At the end of the day, she wasn't a hero or an example for young readers to look up to; she was a puppet who went along with being a puppet when it suited her own goals, and when she no longer had any personal goals, she clocked out and didn't care about the world around her. Even her own romantic choices aren't really choices. The relationship with Peeta was forced on her throughout the first two books. She just went along with it at the end. Might be realistic, but it sure didn't make her a very good central character. Maybe the books should have been told from someone else's point of view.

0061251321|4.0|More reason to believe in other individuals, teams and enable them for organic success. The authors explain the five stages of a tribal growth<br /><br />1) Despairing Hostility - Life sucks<br />2) Apathetic Victim-My life sucks<br />3) Lone Warrior-I'm great (you are not)<br />4) Tribal Pride-We are great (they are not)<br />5) Innocent Wonderment-Life is great.<br /><br />Many companies find themselves caught at stage 2 and 3. The book brings forward techniques and patterns to break the barriers and engineer opportunities to play the game at stage five for evolutionary growth. Establishing a tribe (20-150 people) at level 5 is a huge leadership challenge. The results are unimaginable. Companies working at stage 5 are networking, taking more challenging projects and exhibit a stunning amount of diversity by doing less & achieving more. This book is a way to go for personal and organization triumph with focus on more strategy, less stress and more wealth.
B00715SUI6|3.0|Paranormal 3 follows the same formula as the previous two movies .........hey lets pull the door shut with fishing line and toss furniture across the room with scary noises when no one is around.  This is supposed to take place in 1988 but its not very convincing, the movie still has a very modern 2012 feel to it.  The ending is pretty crazy.  I still like the first one the best.

B006AZZPCM|1.0|Horrible app; minimally functional.  Incessant, irritating and annoying flashing nag reminders make this app worth what it costs.....NOTHING.  Don't be fooled by all the glowing five star reviews; most look like they were put on here by schills for the developer.  Or the advertisers.  :-P.
B003Y5H5HO|2.0|Could be spoilers in here... if anything could really \\"spoil\\" this non-plot movie. Two stars for the actors, even with the atrocious accents. None for the rest of it.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. Unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype. The movie should have been called, \\"Guy who knows a girl with a tattoo.\\" Or maybe, \\"Guy With Bad Judgement Skills.\\" I have not read the book, nor have I seen the Swedish version, so I had absolutely no idea what was going on, and I did not develop any connection with the characters as the movie progressed, other than protectiveness towards the girl, who's body language (but not really anything else she did) reminded me of my autistic brother. I think the director did a poor job of conveying any plot, character development, or mystery. And honestly, is Sweden really like that? A ward of the state at 23? No psychologist visits, therapists, something? If so, I am really, really glad I do not live there. I have tattoos and am fairly antisocial, I would hate to be put in an insane asylum for being slightly different from your average Jane. And just as glad I am not walking around with people who set people on fire for no reason. (They do not say in the movie there was any motivation other than insanity to her act).<br /><br />The mystery in the movie was boring as well. I did not find myself drawn in at all. I had figured out what happened to the girl, (not who did it. they don't give enough information for that), before they even finished telling who was on the island. I never felt any sense of connection with the victims of the killer, they don't give you any information on them other than they died, and broke some biblical taboo. There is no sense of looking in the killer's head either. Why did he do it? Why was he so obsessed with that section of the bible. Was it because he was a Nazi? The rest of the family didn't seem to care they had Nazi officers in their family, seems rather proud of it tome, even though they did not seem antisemitic in any other way. Why did they all hate each other so much? There are so many unresolved plot points it's ridiculous.<br /><br />The violent rape scenes are not edgy in any way, violence is easy, and the second one was over the top. While I realize they are in the books (from reading other reviews), their lack of context in the movie make the visual completely unnecessary. (Yeah, she's been victimized her whole life. However, you don't know this from the movie, you have to learn it from other sources.) Later on she says she set her father on fire. Never says why. It was very poorly done. The actual rape could have been alluded to with just sound (and no, they did not have to be that graphic. I left until they were over. I am rarely so enraged by a movie). I have no plans of ever watching this again, nor of seeing the next two.<br /><br />I could go on and on... but I won't.<br /><br />I'm sure there are a lot of people who will jump on here extolling the virtues of the book, the other version, etc. I am just not interested in reading them, or seeing it, though I usually like foreign movies. I read many good books, and I am sure there are many more I have missed. I just don't think this is one of them. If you want to read some good mysteries (real mysteries. you know, with a plot, motivations... evidence being revealed piece by piece) with female empowerment, and overcoming the horrors of a tragic past, the Eve Dallas books are wonderful. Or \\"The Revenge of the Radioactive Lady\\" which I found to be engrossing, and a good take on Asperger's, and Alzheimer's, as well as a very good mystery as to the main characters motivations.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|So, this book was not what I had expected. With twists and turns, it kept you on alert, and made you need for<br /><br /> more. The book is geared for older children, but as an adult, I felt I got much more out of it than I ever<br /><br /> expected.. Wonder read,,,,,!!
B006ISJQ1W|5.0|The movie is great, a totally Johnny Depp experience. I love the actor, so am a little biased. But all in all the movie was a good experience. I got prompt service from the seller.. and am very glad that this went well. I am always satisfied with my Amazon purchases, they are prompt and just like they say they will be.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I never would have picked up this book based on the description alone. But after all of the positive reviews I heard, I finally picked it up. Then, I could never set it down. The series is encapsulating.  While the content is at times disturbing, the trilogy is an easy read. You'll sit down to read it and won't realize it's hours later.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I first heard about this book in an article, I was intrigued and since I hadn't read a good book in quite a while, I decided to give it a try. I got more than I bargained for, Fifty Shades of Grey is so addicting I couldn't put it down, I hadn't read a book so fast in I don't know how long. Anyway, I will give a brief summary of the book and what I thought about it. I'll try not to give away too many details.<br /><br />Ana is a a senior literature student at Washington State University, weeks away from her graduation and on her way to starting her post-college life. She is knocked off her feet when she meets the handsome, wealthy, and intimidating Christian Grey. Christian is the CEO of his own corporation whom Ana has to interview in place of her friend, Kate who has taken ill. There is an instant attraction between them, a feeling Ana is unfamiliar with that leaves her rattled and bewildered. After some time, Ana is left wanting this man but she gets more than she bargained for when she learns of Christian's dark side. Christian is a tortured soul, damaged from certain events in his life that has left him with a need to control, dominate and inflict pain. He is a true alpha male and a force to be reckoned with. Naive, inexperienced Ana does not know what she is in for when she decides to take a journey into Christian's world but will her innocence and humanity be enough to tame this man or will she only end up getting hurt?<br /><br />This book is amazing, I have never read anything like it. At first glance, it may be just a book about kinky sex but it is much more than that. There is a real love story in this book. Ana is inexperienced at love but soon finds herself falling for this broken man that she only wants to fix. Christian is a damaged man with a dark side that he needs to indulge in but after meeting Ana, he is left feeling things he never thought possible because she is unlike any woman he has ever met. So, you will find the unraveling romance in this book.<br /><br />A few things: Yes, there is some BDSM in this book but it is not as bad as you might think. The love scenes (of which there are many you will come to find) are...hot to put it mildly. I blushed just reading them. If you get embarrassed easily you may want to read these when there isn't anyone around...I found it hard to. How people are comparing it to Twilight I will never know. Twilight is nothing like this...except for maybe the naive girl falling for the dangerous man but that is about it. So if you are looking for another Twilight, you may want to look elsewhere.<br /><br />This book is great, I highly recommend it but read the reviews before you buy in case you have boundaries when it comes the the kinds of books you read, this may be too much for some people because like I said, there is a lot of sex. I can't wait to read Fifty Shades Darker, the second book in the trilogy. Thank you for this book!book.<br /><br />A few things: Yes, there is some BDSM in this book but it is not as bad as you might think.

The package was merely a plastic lined envelope with nothing to stiffen the package or protect the book in any way.<br />I admit that the book is a \\"cheap\\" paperback but I do not believe that a company , interested in my business would be so careless.<br />The book is a good read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book was extremely good. it was very brutal, but sttill captivating. i am so glad that  they made three books and a movie for this.

B003Y5H5BA|5.0|Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum rule in this politically incorrect comedy that had me laughing out loud. Jonah Hill shouting at a suspect running away, &#34;I'm going to shoot you if you don't slow down.&#34; They go undercover to find the drug dealers at a high school. Having been out of high school for 7 years they find it hard to adopt to 2012. Ice Cube was great as the stereotypical angry black police captain who tells people to embrace their stereotypes. Jake M. Johnson is the principle. His first words are &#34;I am just one more gay black kid being punched in the face from a nervous break down.&#34; The drama teacher tells his students, &#34;I remember being in upstate New York doing cocaine with Willie Nelson's horse...&#34;<br /><br />The great one liners are seemingly endless. Jonah Hill tries out for the role of Peter Pan while Channing's chemistry teacher comes on to him. The guys forgot who they were and end up with each other identities. Jonah Hill is in drama and a &#34;track star&#34; while meat head Tatum is in the AP classes. The cops are bumbling in their roles but manage to get the job done. There are some social issues mentioned in the movie in a comedic fashion. One is the difference on how people view a black kid who dies from drugs as from a white kid. Another is the commercialization of education. Highly recommended comedy.<br /><br />Frequent F-bombs, sexual humor, no nudity

I dont want to include any spoilers so i wont say much but \\"Winter is coming\\" and I am very anxiously waiting the start of season 2 premiering April 1st.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Schindler's List is based on a true story within Poland during World War II in the times of the Holocaust. Oskar Schindler is a German businessman whose increasing consciousness of the happenings of the Jewish people becomes his mission to save as many of them as he can from Nazi persecution. From a both a non-Jewish and Jewish perspective, The Holocaust was seen as a selective hatred on the Jewish people, who were a group that did nothing to deserve such an awful ordeal. Oskar Schindler became aware of the treatment and killings of the Jewish people and decided to do something about it. He began by hiring Itzhak Stern, a Jewish accountant, who together with Oskar, would help to save over one thousand Jewish lives from the fatality of the Holocaust. Oskar had to think as both a Jewish and non-Jewish person to accomplish his goal. He had to use non-Jewish thinking in order to relate and make friends with the Nazi's, to make them think he was on their side of supporting the Germans in the war. He did this by buying gifts for the Nazi generals and doing things like throwing parties. Once he was able to gain the trust of the Nazi organization, he was able to convince them to help him with his business venture, in that the war was impacting his business and his money. Oskar convinced the Nazis that he needed Jews to work in order to benefit the Germans by making items made from metal that they could use. By doing this, he was then able to collect Jewish people from the concentration camps to work in his factory. He continued to collect more and more people by bribing the officers and generals with gifts, all while thinking in a Jewish perspective of why such doings were happening to them and how could he save more people. He eventually created a list along with Stern that included the names of hundreds of people, in which Oskar planned to request from the Nazis to work in his factory. This list along with Oskar's growing consciousness to help and save others from the cruel fatalities, led him to save almost 1,100 lives from being gassed in Auschwitz.<br /><br /> It is an amazing movie, that I strongly suggest to everyone, that will affect the consciousness of everyone to remember what once was and how one person can change the lives of many.

B0000C6K09|5.0|The music of John Williams - 40 years of film music is a great set. With any greatest hits compilation there will be complaints of pieces that ought to be  part of this compilation but are not. There will be several folks who will bring up the bleeding chunks argument that the bits and pieces do not do justice to a composer of John Williams's stature and that it does not do justice to showcase 40 years of film music by this composer. For me this set was a great one to get. I am not an ardent OST (original soundtrack collector, but I am very ardent Western Classical Music listener and concert goer. I know I've heard special tracks by John Williams, bought a few OSTs (Star Wars-Phantom Menace), but will not be getting all the individual OST of his films. So for me this set is great if not perfect. It captures on 4 discs, music from his best known films (till 2002).<br /><br />The Indiana Jones and Star wars series is covered quite a bit since each part in the series of both film franchises gets a track or 2. This compilation is from 2003, hence there are no pieces from Indian Jones and the crystal skull (released 2008). Likewise for Star Wars and the revenge of the Sith (released 2005). Oddly no track from Star Wars - Return of the Jedi.<br /><br />This set will no doubt need to be updated at some point to keep up to date with John Williams never ceasing creativity. Even today (in 2012), John Williams has released a great score for yet another Steven Spielberg film - 'War Horse'.<br /><br />Since Spielberg cannot do with any other composer but John Williams for his films and since most of these collaborations were OST hits (as well as movie box office hits), most of the 4 CD compilation with the exception of the CD3 is mostly Williams-Spielberg collaborations. And then there is the Williams- Lucas collaboration in the Star Wars OSTs.<br /><br />To be honest, the music of star wars and Harry Potter films is so amazingly innovative, that although they tried to do theirbest, the producers cannot do justice to the vast range of orchestral imagination that John Williams thought up. So I consider the representation on Star Wars and Harry Potter in this set to be a more of a sneak peek of the goods available. Star Wars with all 6 films seriously needs a separate compilation spanning 2 to 3 CDs at a minimum even if you pick a 'best of' collection. Likewise for Harry Potter series. And there are such sets out there but they are more like 1 CD compilations. You really need a 3 CD set for each of these two film franchises.<br /><br />On the topic of some reviewers complaining that they were expecting the OST, well reading the \\"city of Prague philharmonic Orchestra\\" on the cover should give an indication. Some reviewers feel cheated that they did not get the OST track with smooth finish they expected. Well, on the CD it does not say it is the OST. These are concert performances and are not meant to exactly sound like they sounded on the film. They are not as polished in the mixing since that would have made this set lose the concert performance feeling, which is very different from what you want as a film score. Also the conductor has the liberty to change some nuances in the interpretation of a work which makes concert performances very interesting. I totally loved this CD and cannot wait for an update. I think 50 years from now there will be a 15 CD compilation of the best of john Williams with a lot more samples from each film covering most of his major film scores.<br /><br />Films featured on the set with varying degrees of representation (number of pieces per film)provided below:<br /><br />Sugarland express<br />Jaws<br />Close encounters of the third kind<br />Raiders of the lost ark<br />E.T<br />Indiana Jones- Temple of doom<br />Indiana Jones - Last crusade<br />Empire of the Sun<br />Always<br />Hook<br />Jurassic Park<br />Schindler's List<br />Amistad<br />Saving Private Ryan<br />A.I<br />Minority report<br />Catch me if youcan<br />The Rare breed<br />Jane Eyre<br />The Cowboys<br />The Poseidon Adventure<br />Towering Inferno<br />Family Plot<br />The Fury<br />Superman<br />Dracula<br />The River<br />The Witches of Eastwick<br />Born on the 4th of July<br />presumed Innocent<br />JFK<br />HP and Philosopher's stone<br />HP and the chamber of secrets<br />Star Wars (SW) - a new hope<br />SW - The Empire strikes back<br />SW - The Phantom Menace<br />SW - Attack of the clones

It was as good as the first time around.<br />My favorite theme in the book is the \\"language/words theme,\\" all the incidences where characters' conversations turn out to be a catch-22.<br />This is a serious story told with hilarious humor.

The style is original, the characters are real, and the story is one that deserves to be told, Hitler seen from the perspective of a German family who did not agree with his regime. I was surprised that this is listed as a youth book though; I think it is definitely adult material.
0307719219|4.0|\\"Why Nations Fail\\" is a reminder that countries, like people, don't succeed unless they really want to. In the case of developing countries, all the advice from Western technocrats in the world won't make governance better unless the leaders themselves want to succeed, and the leaders won't want a country to succeed unless it's the best alternative: Sometimes it's not.<br /><br />The book looks at extractive countries versus countries with more balanced, and inevitably, balanced economies, using historical case histories to show how balanced countries succeed and extractive countries fail. A useful way to look at the world today.
0143038583|5.0|You are what you eat, so maybe you should read this book to see what you really are (eating). Learned so many things form this book, highlighted many passages, quote it many times, but the biggest surprise for me was learning how dependent our processed food industry is on a crop that is strictly speaking not even edible; makes one wonder.

0156027321|5.0|I have read this novel about five times since I first bought it in 2007; I never get tired of its symbolism and language. This is without a doubt a classic. I still have not quite figured out the meaning of the strange island with the toxic pools, but that is the joy of this novel; trying to figure out its secrets!

B001HNE3NO|5.0|Excellent book and well written. It seems to me that this book was written based on true events, however this is a fiction story.  This book will make you cry so have on hand plenty of tissue. I highly recommend putting this one on your \\"must read\\" list.

I highly recommend this book.

I read this book in three days!  you feel for all the characters (even the bad ones)  you cannot put the book down because you want to know what happens next...<br /><br />heres the thing.. i had no idea this was a series (like twilight) so when i got to the last page and saw to be continued my jaw dropped because i needed to know what happend!!!  now i cannot wait for this month to be over so i can borrow Catching Fire !!<br /><br />I sure hope the movie lives up the book!

0307957837|4.0|As a fundamentalist Christian, I read the trilogy out of curiosity and enjoyed the world the author created in the series.  The characters had great depth, and the plot moved quickly and kept you interested.  For entertainment purposes, it was a great read.<br />I found the works no more anti-Christian than the works of Homer or other Greek mythology, etc.  What I found slightly laughable was how overt the attack on Christian faith was in the 3rd installment.  All the religious characters in the first 2 books had the veiled digs (the daemons for these characters were either reptiles or insects), but the attack in the 3rd is direct, openly mocking those with faith.  Being secure in my faith, I can move on, but can only recommend the books with the warning that Pullman himself said he wrote the trilogy as an atheist's answer to The Chronicles of Narnia (which has some terrible theology in it as well).  The story is engaging and enjoyable, but the philosophy is antagonistic to those of faith, so just know that going in.

B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Trying to adapt a novel after it's already been done by someone else (and done well I might add) can be a challenge; do you make the same artistic choices? If not, what do you change in your approach to the film? David Fincher's version of Stieg Larrson's novel The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo is a rarity in Hollywood--it's a film that adapts the same source and is every bit as good (if not better) than the first version done.<br /><br />I'm not going to summarize the plot here--enough people have done that quite well. Instead, I'm going to focus on the image quality and special features for the Blu-ray set.<br /><br />This is a dark and foreboding film filled with a sense of dread early on (which isn't a surprise given that it's from the director of \\"Se7en\\" and \\"Fight Club\\"--I wouldn't count on Fincher ever tackling a light comedy).<br /><br />The transfer to Blu-ray is demo quality--blacks are inky and rich looking (particularly noticeable during the opening titles for the film)and detail remarkably sharp with unusually good depth as well.<br /><br />The sound is spectacular with a rich lossless presentation.<br /><br />We get an intelligent commentary track from Fincher discussing everything from the nuts and bolts of making the film to his approach to the material. Interestingly, Fincher was given the novel by producer Kathleen Kennedy before the original film version and Fincher (Kennedy gave it to him because she felt it fit his strengths as a film director) didn't read it at the time believing it would never be bought or opitoned by Hollywood nor that it would become a bestseller in the U.S.<br /><br />The bulk of the special features are on the second disc for the Blu-ray set.<br /><br />We also get exhaustive special features on the production of the film. \\"Characters\\" focuses on the three key characters of the film focusing on the casting with Lisbeth and Martin getting the Lion's share of featurettes (six)vs. a measely four for Blomkvist.<br /><br />We also get a variety of featurettes on shooting on location in Sweden and shooting in the U.S.--these run roughly 100 minutes on the disc. A four part documentary also highlights the post-production and ADR process for the film. There is also a very good featurette on the creation of the disturbing main titles (which reminded me of a very vivid, disturbing Bond-like opening sequence interesting since Daniel Craig stars in the film).<br /><br />The extras continue with a featurette on the promotional aspect of the film focusing on an \\"Inside Edition\\" styled TV program. It's both fascinating and hilarious as it manages to parody shows like \\"Inside Edition\\".<br /><br />The third disc is a DVD copy of the film which has artwork to make it look like a homemade DVD-R with the title written in black marker across the top (as if Lisbeth had made this bootleg herself). It's a clever touch. The only extra on the DVD is Fincher's commentary track.<br /><br />For those who hate Ultraviolet you can continue to hate it more as there is an Ultraviolet passcode included and that's the only \\"digital\\" copy available for this film to upload on your computer. My advice if you dislike Ultraviolet is (which has some severe limitations and issues for many people)is to carry around the DVD edition if you're going to watch it on your laptop (you're out of luck when it comes to an iPad or pad-like device as the Ultraviolet streaming edition is the only option and the coupon expires in 2013 on my copy).<br /><br />\\"The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo\\" remains a rarity; a film that adapts a foreign novel that was already made into a movie previously AND creates a dread-filled film that equals (and in my opinnion surpasses) the previous version of the film.<br /><br />Highly recommended.o get a variety of featurettes on shooting on location in Sweden and shooting in the U.S.--these run roughly 100 minutes on the disc.

B00009ATIX|1.0|This film is more about a long winded love story between two people, and most of the film takes place in flashbacks.  Why anyone is wearing a space suit or on a space station, is beyond me.  The replicants in this film are just an excuse to make this into a boring love story that I ended up caring nothing about.  As a true science ficton fan, I wanted to know more about the planet Solaris, the space station, the crew, but I was bored with the characters, and they might as all well have told their flashback story from a cavern in the Mojave desert.  This was a sad excuse for science fiction.  If I wanted a boring chick flick with George Clooney making love and war with a woman for an hour and a half, I would have rented one.
B006T3RM08|5.0|I did not have any problems with the trackpad \\"sticking\\" in the clicked position, as another reviewer did. Anyhow, if there are problems with the clique, I have dealt with customer support at Hengedocks and they are top-notch.<br /><br />There are at least a couple other products out there that I am aware of that perform the same general task as the Clique. The reason why I think the Clique is better is for the following 2 reasons.<br /><br />1) The power button is accessible for both the keyboard and the trackpad. The developers at Clique were thoughtful and innovative enough to devise a method to access the power button without having to take the trackpad or keyboard out. For the trackpad, it's a simple button located on the side that when pushed, depresses the power button on the trackpad. For the keyboard, the developers got a little more creative and made a sliding switch on the underside of the Clique that when pushed to one side, pushes the power button on the keyboard. Simple, yet Ingenius! Goes to show the level of detail and innovation behind the product. From what I understand, the Magicwand from Twelvesouth does not have a way to access the keyboard power button without removing the device.<br /><br />2) Another reason I like the Clique is that I can depress the trackpad to use the mouse-click function without the keyboard-trackpad combo being on a solid surface. The way the trackpad is designed, it needs to be on a solid surface to use the click function. Since the Magicwand from Twelvesouth is not a complete encasement, the keyboard-trackpad combo must still be on a solid surface in order to use the click function on the trackpad. But since the Clique completely encases the keyboard and trackpad, there is always a solid surface for the trackpad to be depressed against no matter where the keyboard-trackpad combo is. You can have it in your lap and still use the trackpad's click function.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and just purchase the Clique already. And if you haven't looked into the Hengedock, a simple and cheap docking solution for macbook pros, I highly suggest you do. I promise you won't be disappointed.

B004LROMSO|5.0|The timeless tale of King Arthur has been retold via cinema many times.  Add this one to the list of worthy adaptations of a myth that dates back to the Dark Ages.  This version is not as grandiose and mystical as [[ASIN:6305558167 Excalibur]], nor does it invoke knights in shining armor as John Boorman's classic does.  While Boorman focused on [[ASIN:1434470954 Le Morte d'Arthur (Vol. 2) (French Edition)]], the present adaptation takes place much earlier ~ seemingly not long after the end of the Roman occupation.  In this way, it fits in with [[ASIN:B0002YLCG0 King Arthur - The Director's Cut (Widescreen Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B000VKL6ZM The Last Legion]].  Historically speaking, some people may be surprised to know that the myth of Arthur first came about right around the end of the Roman occupation;  the jousts, glistening armor & all the stuff the readers of Thomas Mallory are familiar with came way, WAY later.<br /><br />Now to the present rendition of the Arthurian legend:  we get an Arthur who is a fun-loving, happy-go-lucky womanizing youth who has the throne thrust upon him by the mysterious sorcerer Merlin.  He spends his time convincing people that he has the goods to be their leader and he finds himself in a huge power struggle with his half sister, Morgana, to build his nascent kingdom.<br /><br />As is the case with [[ASIN:B0042RJWTC The Tudors: The Complete Series]], Michael Hirst is able to find lovely, capable & talented actresses who have no issues with shedding their clothes on-camera.  This adds a nice bit of spice to the series & that's always a good thing.  Guinevere, in particular, is absolutely stunning!<br /><br />If you're curious about the Arthurian myth at all, then this series is right for you.  Even if you're unfamiliar with the motifs of the myth, this series serves as a terrific place to start.  Who knows?  It may coerce some viewers to become entranced with the myth, just as millions of other people have done for nearly 2,000 yrs.  As for myself, I can't wait for Season Two to come out on DVD!!for myself, I can't wait for Season Two to come out on DVD!!

B000IZ1HP4|4.0|I usually check the reviews of people who have seen the film. This one however, was familliar to me because of the cast names.  I like Henry Fonda in this one especially. His character he played was mean and dirty.  Guns a blaze every where right from the start.  All the other actors were it seemed in cameo roles. The story was interesting in that it told of a fictisious town built in the middle of no where.  A good film to see and own.

B005HI7NP0|5.0|Betty Wright, in loving collaboration with the Roots and a few surprising extra voices, has created a gospel record for those of us more mature folks, and for younger people making decisions about the most important parts of their lives.  She sings about love, not from the perspective of some romantic fairy tale, but from the point of view of commitment, faithfulness, and partnership in the face of life's troubles. Ms Wright calls for music with meaning, marriage to a mutually supportive partner, faith in the face of difficulties, hard work, strength based on self worth and the beauty of music that draws a couple together. This gospel, like the Gospel, requires the listeners mind, heart, and willingness to work for what is most important in life.  Her voice is up to the task. She pleads, cajoles, calls out to her nephews and cousins, and, like the best sermons, grabs the listeners heart and mind.  Blessings to Ms Wright for the strength and talent to make this so listenable and so engaging.
B006OAB3ME|3.0|Paul McCartney will turn 70 years old in June of this year. In those 70 years, he has spent 50 years in the music business. This includes being a member of the Beatles, a member of Wings, and a solo artist. The average music listener will know McCartney as a great singer/songwriter not only in rock music but in music in general. McCartney has also attempted classical music (i.e.: Thrillington and Ocean's Kingdom) and even experimental music (i.e.: McCartney II and the Fireman albums). For McCartney's new album, Kisses on the Bottom, sees McCartney going back to the music that his parents listened to. This is also some of the music McCartney would play and sing with his father, who was a musician himself. Much like Rod Stewart, McCartney has dabbled in the American songbook but has picked some little lesser known songs. Kisses On The Bottom is another one of Paul's \\"different\\" albums but it's one that he's wanted to make for years. While it may not be the Paul McCartney we're all familiar with, Kisses on the Bottom is still a very unique album.<br />  \\"I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter\\" is a very good way to open the album. Right from the start, you know this is going to be a strange album. Basically, all of the songs may sound the same probably because of the bass and drums. The opening track is actually really nice and Paul's vocals are good. Personally, I enjoy Paul's rendition of \\"It's Only a Paper Moon\\". Paul hasn't really added anything to the song except maybe slowing things down a bit. Speaking of which, the songs are all pretty slow but it's not as bad as it sounds. In fact, there are a few songs pick up tempo. An example of this would be \\"Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate The Positive\\", which is very upbeat and Paul's singing is really good again. At nearly 70 years old, Paul's voice nowadays isn't the same as it used to be but don't get me wrong: he can still sing. Just listen to the track \\"My Valentine\\", which also happens to be only one of the two tracksthat is an original composition (the other being \\"Only Our Hearts\\"). Paul's vocals are just pure and upfront to the listener. Eric Clapton is also playing guitar on \\"My Valentine\\", which does spice the track up. It's smart on Paul's part that this is the lead single because I think it's the best song from the album. Other highlights include \\"The Glory of Love\\", the somewhat silly \\"My Very Good Friend The Milkman\\", and Paul's rendition of \\"The Inchworm\\" from Hans Christian Andersen.<br /> Overall, Kisses on the Bottom is a very good album from Paul. I think it may be one of those albums that gets better with every listen. Luckily, Paul said he won't be doing again or do any overkill like Rod Stewart did. I would like to hear another regular Paul McCartney album sometime soon. His last great one, in my opinion, was 2005's Chaos and Creation In the Backyard. Still, this will do for now.

B006UG90RM|4.0|14 years have passed since Van Halen released a full length studio album. That last album, 1998's Van Halen III, didn't go over well with the fans or the critics. It was also the band's first and only album with singer Gary Cherone. In those 14 years, Van Halen have been active and inactive. In 2007, the band reunited with original singer David Lee Roth for a reunion tour. However, long-time bassist Michael Anthony had been fired and replaced by Eddie Van Halen's son, Wolfgang. Rumors of a new studio album have been flying back and forth since then. Finally after 14 years, Van Halen has released their twelfth studio album. The album, A Different Kind of Truth, is also the band's first album with Roth since 1984's 1984. While this is a new Van Halen album, a majority of these songs were written back in the 1970's when the band first started out. Some may see it as a lack of originality but I see it as an attempt at going back to the old Van Halen sound, which they have certainly done. Despite the firing of Anthony and several other things, it's safe to say that Van Halen are back!<br /> The album opens with the lead single, \\"Tattoo\\", which already sounds like a blast from the past. Roth's voice is in pretty good shape, the song is catchy, and Eddie's guitar playing is just superb. While \\"Tattoo\\" is a great song, it (along with many of the other songs) lacks the wonderful backing vocals of former bassist Michael Anthony. Anthony could certainly hit the high notes and with Roth's lead vocals, the voices blended so perfectly. Anthony's backing vocals were also a vital point to Van Halen's sound that made them famous.  The lyrics are also a bit weak but still, \\"Tattoo\\" is great. \\"She's The Woman\\" is also another strong track. It sounds very much like a song that could have been on the debut album. Another thing I'm impressed by is Wolfie's bass playing. Many fans, including me, have been giving Wolfie a hard time since he replaced Michael Anthony. On this song (as well as the entire album), Wolfie proves himself worthy as a member of Van Halen. \\"You And Your Blues\\" is a little bit slower than the other tracks but is a good example of Van Halen's mash up of clean cut sound with heavier sounds. Roth does really great job on the vocals and the harmonies are actually really great. The band gets to show off their hard rock sound with full blown rockers like the fast pace \\"China Town\\" and energetic rush of \\"Bullethead\\". The latter's lyrics is where the album get its title.  The album is full of rockers but there's also the anthem-driven \\"Blood and Fire\\", the fittingly \\"big\\" sounding \\"Big River\\" and \\"Stay Frosty\\" could quite possibly be the offspring of \\"Ice Cream Man\\" from the debut album.<br /> If you are a fan of the original Van Halen, you should check out A Different Kind of Truth. It is a bit over polished but it is very much in the vein of the material off the first six albums Van Halen made with Roth. Van Halen should be very proud of themselves: they made a very good album. It's official: Van Halen have returned!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the whole story including this not-so-happy (but still happy enough for me) ending. The whole series was riveting and amazing.  I read all three books back to back and was blown away by the end. For me, the books flowed together seamlessly and wove an epic and beautifully tragic story.
B005PR2FD8|4.0|The story is kind of confusing, but hey this is a video game movie. You go to see the action.<br /><br />Anyway, at some parts are slow, and one of the characters was just in for filler.<br /><br />But, otherwise the cg animation and few fighting scenes make up for it.<br /><br />Only flaw with this movie is the confusing storyline. I'd say this would only be for the fans. You probably won't like it if you've never played the game...
B0052UZIFA|1.0|App freezes almost immediately after running on my Transformer. Very surprised PopCap allows such poor quality on a potential market. Please fix!
B005TQAI6G|1.0|What a train wreck. I don't understand the myriad of good reviews! BS obviously screwed herself up so much she has to fill the stage with talented dancers, flashing lights and ridiculous props to distract you from the lip-synching and stiff dancing.<br /><br />While I understand she's older and cannot move the way she used to, she dances worse than Madonna, but Madonna is effing 50-something! So I don't buy the age excuse. I'm thinking she's on medication for Bipolar Disorder making her movements stiff and uncoordinated looking. Could I do what she does? Nope, but damn sure, if I was getting paid untold amounts of money, I'd be like Madonna rocking it like nobody's business.<br /><br />I felt bad for fans that paid outrageous ticket prices. Maybe now is the time for BS to try acting. Thank Goddess this was on Netflix and I didn't buy it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome book...finished all 3 books in about 3 days.. Kindle on iPad is great, for some unknown reason I-books/I-tunes doesn't have hunger games, but the kindle app worked just as good as I books. Either way I loved this book! And I would recommend it to anyone... At first I felt weird for reading a book for teens(since I am 28)... But I still enjoyed it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was the first dystopian novel I've ever read, and what a great novel I chose to break me into this new genre. The Hunger Games was an excellent read, although I wasn't thinking that for the first part of reading this.<br /><br />This had an excellent story, fast-paced action, and even a hint of romance, but for the first third of the book, I was completely uninterested. Fortunately I wasn't bored because of how quick the story moved along, but it was until the actual Games begun that I finally started being consumed by the plot. So many twists were happening one after another, and it was extremely exciting to see what was going to happen next.<br /><br />I also can't help but wonder a few things about this book. For example, as a previous reviewer said, I would have liked to know more about what had caused the fall of the United States, and more about what started The Hunger Games in the first place. And also, why throw children into an arena to fight to the death? If I were living in this world, I would be reluctant to have children so they wouldn't suffer being apart of the Games. It just seems like there could have been other, less cruel ways to show dominance rather than making innocent children kill each other.<br /><br />Regardless of these questions, it still does not change how much I enjoyed reading this, and that I will read the next two books of the trilogy, and also read more books in the dystopian genre.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Alright honestly, I don't write reviews that much, but it kind of bugs me how much crap this album is getting. Yes, the flying VH brothers and DLR have gotten a bit older. Yes Michael Anthony's outstanding backing vocals are missed. But I mean, look at all this band has done. With outstanding albums like VH1&2 Diver Down 1984, stuff like that, of course we're all going to have some pretty high expectations. And honestly after listening to this album for the first time, it EXCEEDED my expectations. All these \\"comeback\\" albums from like Scorpions, AC/DC, Iron Maiden, The Cars, they rock, but I honestly like every track off of A Different Kind of Truth. Who cares if it's \\"not like the 80s\\" like honestly this is some good stuff.<br />1. \\"Tattoo\\" - to be honest, I heard this on the radio a week before the album came out, and I was like \\"what is this...\\" but the song got stuck in my head, and after listening to it a few more times, it really grew on me, and I LOVE the song now. Awesome guitar work and excellent job on the vocals!<br />2. \\"She's the Woman\\" - It's catchy! it really is a fun song, and the band is really starting to prove that they are far from dead.<br />3. \\"You and Your Blues\\" - Yeah! this song really did it for me. Like honestly, if the rest of the album was like VH3 oddness, I would still like this album because of this song. This song is really catchy and doesn't stand out as \\"New Van Halen.\\" It fits right into just \\"Van Halen.\\" Really awesome vocals and harmony, awesome job on the instruments. Great song!<br />4. \\"China Town\\" YES! The first time i heard this one, i was forcing all my buddies to listen to it. The fast-paced, amazing song off this album with some amazing drum beats. Very cool, and very well put together.<br />5. \\"Blood and Fire\\" - Like You and Your Blues, this song is very well put together, and the vocals in this song are awesome! This song gets stuck in my head (in a good way :) ) and it really just completes the album. It's my favoriteDLR vocal song off this album for sure!<br />6. \\"Bullethead\\" - cool! it's catchy, it's just another cool part building up this album to be one of the greatest albums of the 21st century! It's catchy, it's cool. Not my favorite or highlight, but sure completes the album!<br />7. \\"As Is\\" - Here we go! This is by far my favorite song off this album, and perhaps one of my favorite Van Halen songs now! It's got this cool drum beat in the beginning and just explodes with pure energy and excitement and one really cool solo and a sick breakdown. This song honestly just makes you do that smile smirk and makes you think to yourself, \\"Yeah, Van Halen man.\\" Really awesome song (I think it's underrated). But awesome job, VH!<br />8. \\"Honeybabysweetiedoll\\" - it's cool! i like this. This song coming right after As Is doesn't hit it out of the ballpark for me, but I like this song. Like I'll put it this way. I love every song off this album, and this is an awesome song, but it's my least favorite out of the whole album. Like comparatively saying \\"Little Dreamer\\" is my least favorite off of VH1. I love them all, but hope you understand what I'm digging at!<br />9. \\"The Trouble with Never\\" - Like You and Your Blues & Blood and Fire, another catchy song with good vocals in it. This song also has a catchy chorus and honestly all the music played is outstanding, and this just keeps the flow going. At this point while listening to the album, A Different Kind of Truth just became golden for me, because every song before this was awesome, and it just keeps going! A catchy song, and a good fit to this album :)<br />10. \\"Outta Space\\" - This reminds me of something like DOA off of VH2. Catchy song for sure, but not my favorite off the album. It's like, if I put my iPod on shuffle, I'd stop to listen to this for sure! It's catchy. It's Van Halen. It's awesome :)<br />11. \\"Stay Frosty\\" - Here we go! me and my buddy blast this song in the car because it is AWESOME. Naw it's not really an Ice Cream Man pt. 2 for me, but it's a catchy and fun song! For this being the acoustic(ish) song off the album, it really rocks! It's one of those songs that you enjoy listening to over and over again. The DLR style lyrics and singing match well with the outstanding guitar work and drums from the brothers. For sure in the top 3 off this album, and honestly sounds like something they could have made before 1984!<br />12. - \\"Big River\\" It's good :) I love Van Halen.<br />13. -\\"Beats Workin'\\" Catchy, awesome, Van Halen has done it. They have completed a fantastic album. I have never been more impressed with an album, and never had my expectations exceeded like that!<br /><br />My opinion may be a lot different. I didn't grow up in the right generation at all, but growing up as a kid, I listened to VH greatest hits vol. 1 and VH1, VH2, and 1984 so many times throughout elementary school and junior high. Later in high school, I got all their albums and all the \\"Van Hagar\\" albums, and VH3. Since then, I have leaned more towards Van Halen with David Lee Roth, and honestly, this album just did it for me. It really brings the band together, and the amazing sound they all made back in the day is back. It's not going to be EXACTLY like how the generation above me heard it when they were my age, but this album sure rocks. Everyone's different, and my personal opinion is that Van Halen is back. Can not wait to see them in concert in a couple months. AWESOME ALBUM. A MUST HAVE.

B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Do you remember my review of Amazon and Rovio trying to trick us?  If you do then this is part 2.  I got Angry Birds Space on my Ipod thinking it would be better than on my kindle fire but I was wrong because when I won the first level it just shut down.  The reason why I'm putting this on cherry blossom is because I can only put 1 review on space.  Oh and by the way I am giving space 1 star for both ipod and fire and 1 star is not for cherry blossom because cherry blossom deserves 5 stars.
1609611543|5.0|Like most Americans I've been sucked into the advice of \\"big authorities\\" this country \\"says\\" is looking out for us by advising us to eat a \\"heart healthy diet of low fat and whole grain foods.\\" Wheat Belly is without a doubt the single most important resource I've found that tells the truth about the negative affects of eating this way as the primary reason responsible for the drastic increase in obesity (resulting in diabetes), heart disease, arthritis and yes even the increase in cancer. The critics refuse to accept the evidence for lack of clinical research done by the Dr. himself who instead references numerous other clinical research to prove his point. You can argue the validity of his findings based on that all day but the proof is in the pudding. I've been a Marine, involved in Tai Kwon Do and worked out my whole life. I've never had trouble maintaining a healthy weight which I attributed to healthy eating and an active lifestyle. Now at middle age and having a desk job I (like most) assume this is the reason why I struggle to maintain a constant waist size. But look at middle aged Americans in the 50's, they had desk jobs too. A few push ups, sit ups and jumping jacks before bed and few were over weight let alone obese with diabetes and heart disease. The evidence Dr. William presents is overwhelmingly conclusive - it's the genetically modified wheat which took place in the '70s that's responsible for the spike in these deadly diseases and numerous other ailments making certain industries billions by keeping this under wraps. Man was never intended to eat wheat (we were hunter gathers). Early man's diet consisted of meat (chicken, pork, beef and fish) along with nuts, seeds, fruits and vegetables. I'm into my 9th week without eating wheat and without changing anything else in my routine have lost 15 lbs. of visceral fat (the fat that surrounds your organs and puts you on the fast track to health issues people barely had just 30 years ago). I feel more energetic, my clothes fit better, I'm buying clothes with a smaller waist size and have an overwhelming feeling of well being. If you've ever felt like taking a nap at your desk after lunch I urge you to get educated on the dangers of GM wheat which, by the way was never tested for harmful effects to humans as well as many other gm foods being produced today (which by the way are not required to be labeled as Genetically Modified). Don't be fooled by those making billions on the sickness caused by this dangerous staple of the American (and now global) diet. Wheat is proving to be the route cause of the overwhelming increase in the a fore mentioned health conditions. It's hard to argue this point when the increase in these conditions correlates directly with the introduction of the GM wheat.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|When Anastasia Steele is asked by her roommate and best friend, Kate, to do an interview with businessman Mr. Grey for a school magazine article for her after Kate comes down with the flu, Ana reluctantly agrees.  What she did not expect was to be attracted to the young, hot, sexy Christian Grey.  What Ana finds in Christian is so much more than she could have ever imagined in her wildest dreams...or nightmares.<br /><br />I loved the witty banter back and forth between Ana and Christian.  Between their conversations and their emails, I fell in love with them as a couple.  I love Christian.  He is so hot and sexy...but he definitely has his issues.  I was really hoping that by the end of the book we would have been able to find out a bit more about him, but he keeps himself so closed off.  Hopefully we will see more insight into his personality and his \\"needs\\" in the next two books.<br /><br />The only real issue I had with this book was Ana herself.  First, she seemed too innocent to me.  A 21-year-old virgin is not hard to imaging, but a 21-year-old who knows next to nothing about sex, even though she has a loud and mouthy roommate who does not seem too concerned about spilling the beans about her escapades.  While most of the time I enjoyed being inside her head...Her inner goddess was my favorite...she was really ambivalent about things, especially her feelings.  She just did not seem to know what she wants.  On one hand I can see her warring with her desire for Christian and her fear of his \\"needs,\\" but on the other, she knew from the beginning what she was getting herself into (I mean, he actually wanted her to sign a contract...how much clearer does that get?), but she just kept hoping and dreaming and in the end was surprised and heartbroken when she did not get what she wanted.<br /><br />Anyway, overall I loved this book.  I thought it was quite well written, the dialogue is very well put together and fun to read, and the sex scenes are...oh my...hot, hot, hot.  I can't wait to get started on the next one!!hot.  I can't wait to get started on the next one!!
0307956350|4.0|First, thanks to SHELF AWARENESS and the book's publishers for providing me with a copy of this book.<br /><br />While spy thrillers aren't my usual reading fare, buzz for this debut was too strong to pass it up. The premise: an ex-CIA agent (Kate) moves to Luxembourg with her family for her husband's (Dexter) new job. There they meet another ex-pat couple whose actions and lifestyle raise Kate's suspicions. While Kate has her own secrets, the more she digs, the more she learns and fears Dexter is hiding some secret of his own - and it's a biggie.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil anyone with more detail. Suffice to say the story is a nice twist on the thriller genre. There is plenty of suspense naturally, but instead of relying on frantic action scenes and over-the-top plotlines, it's a result of sharp and concise prose that propels the story and the reader from one situation to the next. I couldn't wait to start the next chapter to see what the heck was going to happen or be revealed.<br /><br />Aside from a bit of trimming to tighten it up, the book makes for an excellent debut. Spy fans and fiction lovers alike should enjoy.
B0063GORYU|5.0|i love playing this game on my nextbook.....<br />it was great to find it on the appstore and i have told alot of people about it too
0439023521|5.0|This book was THE MOST exhilarating book I have ever read. I was immersed, could never put the book down for a second. I think that this book really pushes you in and makes you want to KEEP READING. Suzanne Collins really gets into detail the gore of The Hunger Games and Katniss' life. I recommend this book to... well... EVERYONE.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great app. lots of fun. many levels to beat and unlock. maybe add few more games that differ. many of the levels are similar to.others.
0439023521|5.0|I loved The Hunger Games. What a great fast-paced read. Highly recommend for those who love suspensful adventure. I read the book before seeing the movie. The best ever!!!!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I like it.  It has an interesting twist on an old favorite.  You have a quest to complete by solving the puzzles.
B001OQCV6A|1.0|As a life-long Sherlock Holmes fan, I've seen many actors convincingly portray this dynamic character. And for years, I have enjoyed the work of Robert Downey Jr. -- back to his early roles in Home For The Holidays and Chaplin. However, I am deeply disappointed to find he has pandered to the audience and the cash register as the Holmes character in these latest empty episodes. Sadly, these last two productions rely almost exclusively on computer-generated special effects, fly-by-wire martial arts moves, and pop culture titillation to carry the movie. No thanks!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Touching on many complex aspects of a modern society (class stratification, the humiliation of abject poverty, voyeurism of mass media, the physical and emotional costs of war), there is lots to find in this book.  The criticisms concerning Katniss, e.g. too simplistic, one dimensional, unbelievable, etc. all fail to take into account that she is 16-17 years old.  Her tendency to think in absolutes, both emotional and physical, is typical of the way we all think as teens (as I vaguely recall).  The author's choice in protagonist is a very calculated effort to develop a story which is straight forward, yet surprisingly deep.  Readers will find an exceptional and thought provoking story if they don't expect Katniss to behave and think like an emotionally mature adult.
0143116738|5.0|While its not unusual to hear the advice to \\"follow your passion\\" as basic counsel for one's vocation...in his short book The Element, Sir Ken Robinson completely builds the case for multiple types of intellect and abilities, and more importantly how to personally deploy them. His approach is both filled with descriptions and examples. Its also constructed with humor and authenticity because Sir Ken openly acknowledges his own passions and shortcomings.<br /><br />My only wish is that this philosophy for education and career choices could have reality as a policy in the USA instead of the ignorant and wasteful notions of \\"every kid should go to college\\" and \\"you go to college to get a good job\\".<br /><br />I personally try to keep up with the offerings of this writer, he's the real deal and has plenty of thoughtful observations along with practical implications.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|I paid 5 bucks for this app that takes an hour to download the extra space it needs just for the stupid thing to crash.  I love the real game, but this app is a total waste of time and money.  If I could rate it below 1 star I would.  Be warned.  It is not worth it!

B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is relaxing, yet mentally challenging.  Each level looks easy, but then you play and realize that it is not as easy as it seems.  Collecting points to use for hints when it gets frustrating helps to keep you playing. I would recommend this game to anyone.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i like having more than 1 game at a time and i think mixing new games with old games is very clever
B006OCM0G0|3.0|It's a very addictive fun game.  From decorating your restaurant to picking your menu, the game keeps you engage at all times.  The only thing that I don't like is that you need to invite friends at certain level to continue expanding.  Can you guys eliminate that?  If you have the coins to expand that should be good enough.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|OK, I confess. I'm a 40-something male who was curious about all the fuss and the movie build-up. I thought it was an excellent read, I could hardly put it down. Surely, I should not feel shame to be wanting to read the other two books in the series,should I?

B00030EIXW|5.0|This DVD features a live concert in Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, featuring the famed Concertgebouw Orchestra under the baton of Carlos Kleiber, from 1983.  The conductor is seen in top form here.  His baton technique is unconventional but elegant - it is not something one can emulate.  The orchestral playing is superb, and the camera work is detailed without going overboard.<br /><br />Another live performance of the 4th and the 7th, with Kleiber leading the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, can be found in CD format:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000L9VAD6 Carlos Kleiber. Beethoven Symphony No 4 +7 Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra.]]<br /><br />There is no commercial DVD release of Kleiber conducting Beethoven 5th, but there is a superb live recording of him conducting the Chicago Symphony in the 5th on CD:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00133RKDI Kleiber Conducts Weber: Der Freischutz Overture; Schubert: Symphony 3; Beethoven: Symphony 5; Butterworth: English Idyl 1; Mozart: Symphony 33 and Brahms: Symphony 2]]<br /><br />The playing is even more electrifying than the famed DG recording, with fast tempi.  A must have for Kleiber fans!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Love this game! Very addicting. Been playing this for a long time on my Ipod. Always looking for neighbors, add me: Chungkee. Also play farm and bakery story. My other ID is Chungkee1964.
B000001GPX|5.0|Carlos Kleiber and the Vienna Philharmonic are both in top form on this recording.  Kleiber leads a taut reading of the 5th, not unlike Karajan's 1963 recording.  The Vienna horns are prominent throughout (perhaps doubled in numbers?).  The 7th is an equally great, if not a greater, reading.  The first and second violins are seated on the opposite sides of the podium, and the stereo effect intended by Beethoven in the finale is realized in full as a result.  The Vienna horns hit all the high B's brilliantly.<br /><br />If you are a Kleiber fan, you might be interesting in this 2-CD set:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00133RKDI Kleiber Conducts Weber: Der Freischutz Overture; Schubert: Symphony 3; Beethoven: Symphony 5; Butterworth: English Idyl 1; Mozart: Symphony 33 and Brahms: Symphony 2]]<br /><br />The playing of the 5th on this live performance is even more electrifying, with faster tempi in all movements and a sudden surge of pace and energy towards the end of the finale.  A must-have for Kleiber fans!
B004ZQBP3Q|2.0|I dont know where to start in this review of sorry for party rocking the sleezy raps the annoying voice of redfoo or the lack of production  by their record company. the song party rock anthem that was the most annoying song on the album but when i kept listening to the album i regreted purchasing it i have wasted 11.00 on this worthless piece of junk. and if i was you i wouldnt even dare to look at it.<br /><br />Sound: The annoying voice of that redfoo guy really gets me on my nerves you probably get brain damage if you listen to the album 24/7 driving around in your car or something.<br /><br />Songwriting: The main thing thats wrong with this album is that it lacks songwriting and the sleezy raps from redfo and skyblu. the dance beats can get totally annoying to the point of insanity<br /><br />Bottom line: Lmfao do better next time<br /><br />My rating<br /><br />5/10

1451648537|5.0|This is an incredible book. Steve had an amazing life, full of innovation, brilliance and hardship. I listened to the audio version of this book, and was moved to a number of different emotions through the reading. I felt inspired by Steve's innovations, he truly had a unique way of getting the best out of his team. The ending of this book is extremely emotional. Steve was a true icon and his battle with cancer is very moving.<br /><br />I think that Walter Isaacson has done very well with this book. He conveys the adventure of the young Steve as he founded apple with Steve Wozniack. He also does a great job recounting the Pixar story. At the same time, however, Isaacson does not shy away from revealing the pricklyness of Jobs. Steve Jobs was a perfectionist and it's apparent that his drive for aesthetic perfection led to him appearing harsh to his coworkers.<br /><br />Overall, a great life very well told.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I love the books, I love the Swedish movie version and I love this version. Each has their own things that set it apart from each other. What's not to love about more Lisbeth. I think David Fincher did an excellent job with this film.  I also loved the packaging for the DVD which some seems to complain about.

0307956350|2.0|After reading many gushing reviews extolling the bountifulness of this tome and a starred review in Pub. Weekly, I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of this book.  What a disappointment!  With slow and plodding writing, the main character, Kate, comes across as a bit of a dullard.  She's allegedly an ex-CIA top-line spy and assassin.  If she's indicative of the caliber of folks who populate the ranks of America's CIA, then God help us all.  And her dim-witted investigation into her husband's behavior was quite childish.  Not to mention that her suspicions about her husband were more like a contrivance, as her husband's behavior didn't come across as very suspicious at all.  The publicist/marketing activities for this book were clearly an accomplishment far better than the book itself.  Makes one wonder about reviewers in Pub. Weekly and about those who deliver 5-starred accolades on Amazon for tripe like this (maybe all submitted via pseudonyms by the publisher?).  Save your money.  This is an over-hyped piece of dreck.<br /><br />Fred G.

B0072GPQNG|5.0|I just saw this movie last night.  It was a very fine movie.  It tells the story of a thoroughbred horse who never really was able to live his life as a thoroughbred horse should.  Instead of racing he was made to plow fields.  Instead of living a life with other thoroughbreds, he gets shipped off to the horrors of World War One.  But joey, the horse, is a survivor and a leader.  He is quick to learn how to plow a field and then is quick to learn how to perform in a cavalry charge in the face of machine guns.  He then shows the other horses how to pull artillery through muddy fields.  The only thing this horse never learns is how to jump.<br /><br />The inability to jump leads the horse to become entangled in barbed wire which then leads to a rather unlikely peaceful meeting between a British and a German soldier as they try to untangle Joey.  They are successful and Joey somehow avoids the mercy bullet of the matter-of-fact sergeant.  But the entire movie shows how Joey's most remarkable character trait consistently reappears, his ability to win over the admiration of those around him.<br /><br />Joey first won the respect of Ted, a farmer and former soldier of earlier conflicts.  He then won over Albert, Ted's son.  In succession Joey wins the love of a cavalry officer, a German deserter, a young local girl, another war horse, another German soldier, and eventually two opposing armies in the field.  Through it all he wins the hearts of everyone in the movie theater.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg did his usual fine job of directing a cast of newcomers and no-names to create a film worthy of Best Picture nomination.  It did not win the Academy Award, but it is still an excellent movie well worth the time it takes to watch it.  It shows the horros of World War One and how an animal can be the main character of a major motion picture.  In a sense, Joey, or rather the many horses who played him, should have been nominated for Best Actor because this horse is reason enough alone to go see this movie.

B006N0YWGY|5.0|I downloaded this months ago when it was free, but have only recently begun playing it. The simplicity of the game (racing through a course, picking up strategically placed bonuses) makes it just plain fun. I do recommend trying both the touch and tilt controls because you may find that you are better at one than the other -- but don't assume you know which it is. (You can set the sensitivity of the tilt mode)<br /><br />In addition to more levels/maps, I would love to see more hidden bonuses for crashing into houses, shacks, chickens, and other boats. Thanks, devs!
B001UV4XFG|2.0|In my opinion, Eclipse (the movie) is by far the worst depiction of the corresponding book than the other movies in the series. Now this is not to say that viewers may not find this entertaining because to some degree, whether you read the books or not, you may not feel it COMPLETELY sucked... It does have a lot of action to take away from some of the suckery so... there's that, but aside from the fighting action that took place, the movie fell VERY flat.<br /><br />Now I will breakdown it's suckery. SPOILER ALERT! WILL NOTE WHEN SPOILER ENDS.<br /><br />Information given in the movie lacked further explanation...<br />If you never read the books and only watched the movies, some parts in this movie will NOT make sense. Case in point, Jacob's reveal of him being the rightful Alpha! There was no explanation on how that was even possible! At least, as far as the movie goes. Then there's Jacob insisting that Bella has some hidden feelings for him but the movie lacks evidence of the connection even though in the book/s, Jacob and Bella spent a whole lot of time together. In the books, Jacob and Bella's relationship is very well developed. What the movies (both New Moon & Eclipse) never showed that was actually in the books was the endless amount of times they hung out together. They held hands quite often and even Bella mentioned how from a far, they would seem like a couple based on how close they were. Bella would notice Jacob in a way that went beyond a friendship, especially when Bella had Jacob over one time and she kept focusing on his bare chest, which prompted her to ask him about him never seeming to wear a shirt. Now a lot of people who may watch the movies probably has no idea the real reason why Jacob doesn't always wear a shirt and it has nothing to do with his body temperature nor do it have to do with trying to impress Bella. Ecplipse (the movie) doesn't show that scene at all and cuts to Jacob leaving Bella's house. This was a necessary scene to put in there because not only would it have given a valid explanation behind Jacob's topless moments but also it would've shown some understanding as to why Jacob was insisting that Bella has hidden feelings for him. Which brings me to the famous \\"kiss\\" scene between Jacob and Bella. I kid you not, EVERYBODY in the theater with me, when that scene came about, did a collective confusion of \\"WHAT???\\" I don't even have words for how cheesy they made that scene be. In the book, it was a slow burn that Jacob hinted around that made Bella realize what he wanted from her. She was reluctant at first but he talked her through it and got her to relax enought to give into the feeling and when she finally did, she saw the future she could have with Jacob, going as far as seeing herself having his children! (That must've been one heck of a kiss;-) The movie doesn't show any of this. You don't know what she's thinking in this moment so the movie lacked a connection in that moment.<br /><br />Now that I said all of that, I'll now mention the bad acting...<br />Now when I say bad acting, I really mean Jacob's character. This is not to throw salt on Taylor Launter because he seems to be a decent guy but his acting in Eclipse made me feel like he should've been a villian in Batman (the cartoon). I don't think Taylor Launtner can play a cocky character... he's just way too sweet. So his 'bad boy' comes off animated and exaggerated instead of confident and cocky, which is why the bad acting took away from me getting into the story.<br /><br />Another issue I had was the phasing of the wolves...<br />I don't know if they just got lazy when working on Eclipse or if there was new people working on the CGI wolves and didn't know how to make it as detailed as it was in New Moon, but it was poorly done. In New Moon, you could literally play it in slow motion and see the transition from human to wolf in both Jacob and Paul. You could see the wind move through their fur whereas in Eclipse, the wolvesphased like a coat was quickly thrown on them and all the wolves looked almost similar in color. If you didn't see New Moon, then you may not realize how much it sucked but if you did then you may see how the wolves in Eclipse are lacking. But hey, you may not care about that.<br /><br />END OF SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />So, here's my pros and cons...<br /><br />Pros...<br />Action is good.<br />Overall, visually appealing.<br />You may appreciate secondary characters more in this movie.<br /><br />Cons...<br />Lacked explanation for non-book readers.<br />Bad acting.<br />Bad CGI.<br />Lacked chemistry amoung some characters.<br /><br />Recommendations? Read the books... even if you think it'll be complete suckery.

1594121141|4.0|This wasn't my first Agatha Christie book but it was my first Poirot and, as it turns out, is the first Christie book in which Poirot is featured. Written in 1920, it reminded me much of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, but with a beefier plot and a little more twisty misdirection. I enjoyed the book and will definitely read more.

B0053YGYO4|4.0|I'm what you would call a recent convert to the world of Coldplay music. I had never really heard any of their music until Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends in 2008. Of course I had heard the song \\"Yellow\\" and thought it was all right. After hearing \\"Clocks\\" I decided to get all their records. At first I thought they were not all that great, kind of boring, until Viva.<br /><br />Now we have Mylo Xyloto (apparently pronounced my-lo za-lee-toe), their 5th studio album. It is certainly a next step from Viva in the sound, which I am certain is due in part to Eno's influence (perhaps U2 and Coldplay need to take a step away from Eno and just produce an album or two on their own). The songs are all catchy like one would expect from a Coldplay album. The story line, boy and girl are trying to survive in a dystopia world; they break up and then get back together again is simply an excuse for the songs on the album and is certainly not going to remove albums like The Wall from the top of the \\"concept\\" album pile. So what if it's a weak story line? The songs are enjoyable and Martin's singing is as smooth and silky as ever. The band is playing well and even get a little funky at times.<br /><br />Why critics seem to hate this band is beyond me. God forbid a band actually sing songs with melodies and harmonies instead of relying on hideous, self-indulgent, party-themed rap with no melody and mostly meaningless lyrical content. They certainly don't get overly political, but is that what it takes to get a good review?<br /><br />As far as the sound of this album is concerned, I don't understand what people are complaining about. I bought the vinyl version and have no complaints about the sound. Perhaps my old ears are beginning to lose it, but it sounds very well produced to me.<br /><br />In my opinion Mylo Xyloto is more accessible than their earlier albums and certainly worth multiple listenings.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some of the games are hard to play because you have to drag your finger to move the cursor but I am sure not all devices have the same sensitivity. also some of the games are boring but some you can really get into.
B00785P2QC|4.0|l think it is fun. The only flaw is that it is too short. it is very fun and additive. it is the best except that flaw :)

B003TJR2HS|5.0|After being very disappointed with the ipod touch not fitting into ANY docking station cradle in my house while in its new, safe, necessary case, I decided there had to be SOME WAY to be able to keep my Ipod Touch safe AND be able to play music. After much searching, I found this product. Being hesitant, I bought two just in case it didn't work well. It worked like a charm. I am now back to buy 5 more for all of our radios and dock stations so I don't have to move it from one to the other and/or lose it. I am thrilled with this product and how it still lets your item charge, not just play the music. Apple should have thought about kids having Ipods- wanting to keep them safe AND play music. Glad someone thought of this, and I am one happy customer! Thank you!

0812992792|4.0|Let's get one thing clear right from the get go - Adam Johnson is a white American dude who teaches literature at Stanford University and who has had very little opportunity to live or work in North Korea, the country of which is one of the subjects of this novel. In fact, he's only been to North Korea once in his lifetime. But somehow, he manages to capture our imagination and what he believes the life that exists in North Korea must be like.<br /><br />The novel follows Jun Do's (John Doe?) life and Jun Do is supposed to be a stand in for the average North Korean man - the anonymous, like our John Doe or Jane Doe would be here in the States. Jun Do is raised in an orphanage, even though he's not really an orphan. In fact, the man that runs the orphanage is Jun Do's biological father; but Jun Do has never met his mother (who is supposedly a beautiful opera singer that lives in Pyongyang) and he has never been to a museum (even the \\"North Korean kind\\"). The orphanage is located in a very remote industrial town, so Jun Do gets through his entered childhood without seeing Pyongyang. When Jun Do comes of age, he is assigned to military training where he is trained in no light combat and put into tunnels underneath the de-militarized zone and then on kidnapping missions where he is charged with kidnapping seemingly innocent Japanese citizens. As a reward, he is sent to Language School where he learns English and then assigned to a fishing ship where he listens to English broadcasts and types out what he hears on a typewriter. Eventually Jun Do is promoted so much that he is sent with an intelligence team to the United States (Texas) and eventually, to impersonation of a high level military official.<br /><br />I found that the first half of the book was absolutely fascinating while the second half of the book was really, really weird The second half of the book also seemed to deal in stereotypes of North Korea (although I have to say that for all I know it's really like that there - I've never been there and probably never will be there so maybe I'll never find out, although I find it hard to believe that political prisoners are treated the way that they are treated in this novel). AS far as novels go, I really enjoyed it - it was entertaining although sometimes confusing, particularly in the second half of the novel. I generally enjoyed it though.that there - I've never been there and probably never will be there so maybe I'll never find out, although I find it hard to believe that political prisoners are treated the way that they are treated in this novel).

B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is the first time I read Nicolas Sparks books. I have enjoyed many movies that were from a few of his books. Safe Haven was the first book I read and enjoyed every bit of it. Didn't like the ending but it turned out exactly like I hoped through out the book.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I have tried several apps.  this is very good weather app. never have had a problem ..  I would recomend? this to all..
0439023521|3.0|I would have enjoyed this book much better had it been a little more realistic. But I know it's more of a YA novel so I guess I can forgive that. It was a great parody of reality TV. Most of it was fun to read. However, I didn't appreciate the zombie werewolves. Pretty corny and ridiculous. To me the main weakness of the book was that I never felt a real connection to any of the characters. It felt like a compilation of of different science fiction elements and it ended up not feeling as real as it could and should have.
B0059XTUEK|1.0|I  was really looking forward to the movie.  It did not compare to what I've read and seen of her life.  Maybe casting was kind of off.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|The Forever Girl is a wonderfully crafted, beautifully written story that is just FUN to read.  Sophia's character, with her gentle flaws and dysfunctional family, is easily relatable, and the author does an excellent job of keeping our sympathies with Sophia, ensuring we are truly invested in her journey as she struggles to understand her nature, listen to her heart, and embrace her future.  Charles is utterly compelling, and his relationship with Sophia is truly one of the great romances in fiction (the sexual tension is both extreme and utterly divine).<br /><br />I particularly admire the way the author blended the mythos of vampires into a Wiccan backdrop, re-examining and recreating the story of these immortal creatures within an entirely new context.  While the author's written voice is different from Anne Rice's style, I often found myself comparing the Forever Girl to the Vampire Chronicles, for the mythology Hamilton has created, drawing from Wiccan beliefs, is entirely plausible and reminiscent of Anne Rice's elaborate vision (though entirely different in concept - a welcome originality with so many vampire knock-offs abounding).<br /><br />Magic, real witchcraft (not the popularized version), vampires, shapeshifters, love triangles, plot twists and turns that will keep you guessing right up to the end, and a romance to die for - you really can't go wrong reading this book.  It is truly pleasurable from beginning to end.  Highly recommended!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Minus one star because NIV isn't available for download. Love the devotional feature. Also, I like the fact I can highlight and take notes.

B001GCUNYO|5.0|I'm not a big fan of action movies. They tend to focus on violence and killing as many people as possible in the most original ways, but a select few have more depth. Taken falls into the latter category.<br /><br />Why is it so good?<br /><br />If you had told me that a 56-year-old actor would make one of the best action movies I've ever seen, I would have laughed and thought how bad Roger Moore's version of James Bond was in A View to a Kill and Octopussy. Action movies often feature actors who look the part, but who can't really act. Arnold Schwarzenegger springs to mind. Liam Neeson changes all that with this one performance. He doesn't look like he could take on the world, but his acting ability is so good that he convinces you that he's capable of everything he does in the movie.<br /><br />Bryan Mills (Neeson) used to work for the government as a CIA operative. He still associates with friends from his previous job, but he's given up that career in an attempt to get closer to his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace). She lives with his ex-wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen), and her rich stepfather. When Mills takes Kim a thoughtful gift on her seventeenth birthday, her stepfather gives her a horse. Mills doesn't seem to have a chance of winning her respect. What's more, Lenore apparently hates him.<br /><br />Mills is given another chance to make a connection with Kim when she asks him to sign a consent form so that she can leave the country for a vacation. As she's 17, she needs the permission of both parents. Mills isn't happy about the idea. He's seen a lot of criminal activity in his former line of work and understands the dangers involved. Is he just being paranoid? His dire warnings seem exaggerated, but we soon see that they are justified.<br /><br />Kim goes to Paris with her 19-year-old friend and trusts everyone she meets. The day she arrives, an Albanian gang take her and her friend captive. We learn that they intend to control her through drugs and turn her into a prostitute, or perhaps even sell her to a willing buyer.<br /><br />Perhaps the best moment in the movie is when Mills talks to Kim's captor on her phone:<br /><br />\\"I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.\\"<br /><br />He says it with absolute conviction.<br /><br />I won't give away any more of the story. That setup takes around 25 minutes. If I have done a good job, perhaps you can understand why Taken is different. Mills is real. We understand his motives for giving up his job. When Kim is taken, we start to see some of the skills he claims to possess.<br /><br />If she was your daughter, how would you react? What if you had the requisite skills to seek her out yourself? Is there anything you wouldn't do to save her?<br /><br />Director Pierre Morel doesn't waste a single minute. At 93 minutes, the movie is lean and the action rarely allows us time to breathe once Mills kicks into action. He's a relentless killing machine, but, unlike most action heroes, his abilities seem authentic. To make things seem even more urgent, we experience everything from his point of view. Expect to see plenty of fast cuts during chase scenes, just as you would in The Bourne Trilogy.<br /><br />It's easy to root for Mills because of the strong characterization. Neeson excels in this role and carries the movie throughout. I wonder if we'll start to see other good actors cast in action roles as a result? Taken is an enjoyable thrill ride with almost endless replay value.o a prostitute, or perhaps even sell her to a willing buyer.<br /><br />Perhaps the best moment in the movie is when Mills talks to Kim's captor on her phone:<br /><br />\\"I don't know who you are.

0307592731|5.0|We all have our own journey, and map our own course accordingly.  This book allows the reader a rare view of someone else's life journey unfolding at a young age when taking big risks are an easier decision than they are later in life.  I have rarely felt as moved by someone else's journey as I have this one, perhaps because Stayed's writing is succinct, accessible, but not overly descriptive.  As my former college English professor chirped - \\"Show me, don't tell me!\\"  Strayed does just this, leaving us to live the moments on the trail as if we were her past traveling companion instead of merely a seated reader flipping pages with abandon - immersed in the journey.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  If you have ever left the prescribed path in search of a new life, or have wondered what would come of attempting to venture off in to the unknown in order to heal a painful past, this is the book for you.  I also love the fact that Strayed embarked on this journey as a normal working woman would or could - she is not an East/West coast elite liberal arts college grad who decided to strike off on a 'wild' post college adventure to find herself because of a huge trust fund and a taste for a bohemian lifestyle.  Strayed's journey comes across as true and pure. I for one am glad she made it from darkness to light, and am grateful for the opportunity to read about her amazing life. Thanks Cheryl!

B005CKPQHA|5.0|..what can I say? I was just riveted to the back of my chair. Watched all 33 episodes in one long weekend on Netflix then caught season 4 here on amazon. I have to say...I haven't seen any show in my entire life...and I'm 61 years old...thats this powerful....YO....(lol)....I'll admit the first 1-2 episodes didn't really take hold like the blue meth does but after the second episode I was a totally junkie!! I even paid 4x the price to see the last 12 episodes on amazon...now thats a true junkie...lol.<br />Every single character is cast perfectly. You have to love every one of them....and just when you think you know whats going to happen next? It turns completely around on you and goes into subplots and detours and flash-aheads which they catch up to and explain in the coming episodes. This Gilligan is one amazing writer!!!..and every actor you totally buy into.<br />It's also good that they show you what meth does to a soul instead of glamorizing it like how the Sopranos glamorized the violence...as most films do.<br /><br />What am I gonna do when all the episodes are over...I need my fix YO
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I downloaded as FAOTD and initially had the crash problem, but once that was fixed, I made it through without any glitches. It was fun trying to figure out which combinations would create a new element. Some of the results were humorous- such as creating censorship. I thought this was going to be a drawing app from the title. Once I started creating, I had trouble stopping- just one more combination!
B007N5YIUS|1.0|i have installed 2 times and still forces close just as game starts. i use an impressions android tablet. please fix.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Let's get clear on one thing right off the bat - this is some of the finest Springsteen you're ever going to listen to. Period. If you could only grab 5 Springsteen CDs from your collection and had to leave the rest behind forever - this would be one of the 5.<br /><br />I first got enthralled with Bruce Springsteen as a Freshman at UCLA, circa 1976, when a friend in my dorm turned me in on to \\"Born to Run.\\" Since then I've gone in and out of my Springsteen phases, but as I'm listening to this album right now, listening to GREAT songs like \\"Shackled and Drawn,\\" \\"Death to My Hometown,\\" \\"Wrecking Ball,\\" \\"Rocky Ground,\\" \\"We Take Care of Our Own\\" - all 5-star songs - I'm recapturing that same thrill and excitement, that same soul-stirring feeling I did as an 18 year-old kid living in that UCLA dorm. This music makes me want to get up, dance and shout . . . and it brings me to deeply quiet, reflective, prayerful states of being. It spans the spectrum of thought, feeling, experience.<br /><br />Springsteen is playing today like he did as a hungry, young artist more than 35 years ago, playing with the same depth of feeling and conviction, maybe even with greater conviction--the kind born from life experience. He's playing with ferocity, intensity. His band is tight. And, at the same time, he's forging new musical pathways, experimenting musically, recreating himself anew. This IS rock and roll at its finest!!<br /><br />As a side-note, I recommend the CD (as opposed to the download) for the liner notes, lyrics, and his moving tribute to Clarence Clemons.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play this game when watching tv or waiting for something or someone. It can be mindless (on one deck) or get complicated with many decks. I don't get bored with this game like I do with others

B0064NTZJO|4.0|the acting was good---few words needed to be said in this movie--the subtleties are what makes this unique and very appealling and ultimately satisfying. the music certainly fit the look of the film and the action was quick and ruthless--if you like michael mann you will most likely appreciate this film
0316056863|2.0|I couldn't wait to read her book..she is the epitome of modern woman for this 66 yr. old grandmother. So, I was stunned to read a book that seemed to come from the pre-60's. Really, a 1970 guy would be \\"amazed at a woman so feminine she couldn't split a stick of gum? \\"  Good god!<br /><br />Further, it was racist...see 2 blacks on one bike, lock bike in garage. I am from deep south, 50's and never would have thought this.<br /><br />Finally, bragging about gay friends in post 60 just seems odd. People had gay friends as a matter of course. Now, people certainly were afraid to come out to parents but having gay friends, getting high, marching in protests were all part of mainstream life even in deep south where I live. Watch Mad Men to see evolution of culture in 60's. It was huge and yet Bossypants reads like a memoir by Doris Day.<br /><br />Her father leaving her alone at 9 in store, not smiling at her school performances just seems like a bad father...not a badass dude.<br /><br />I did keep reading and it does pick up at SNL chapters.

B007MNV5WU|4.0|The space atmoshpere sucked me in at first play, and I liked how the main screens were interactive. Would have liked to seen additional levels to each stage, which made the game shorter. Overall it kept the addictive quality as the first, maybe see an update for the stages?
B004JZBGWI|5.0|i really like it so far but i have one question how do i get to the screen with post it notes not the list other then that so far its a great app as long as you get the one for your device
B004ZNACA6|5.0|Purchased the set expecting better sound on the disc's. I could tell a difference on some of the disc's. I'm happy with them. My disappointment came with the cd cases or lack of. When paying this much for cd's I would expect them to come in slim line jewel cases at the very least. Not cardboard sleeves. My only complaint about this collection.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|its good but its hard finding golden eggs. if you're reading this ( just in case)  remember theft angry bird space is out.
B002KSPKRS|1.0|Not useable with my wireless router.  Their explanation,this is not an issue with the Turtle Beach Headset (and it is not defective) but a limitation of the RF Wireless Technology. the only alternative option might be to use Wired Headphones. There is only so much bandwidth available.  Funny, I don't have this issue with my wireless Sennheiser Surrounnd Sound headphones. Before purchasing go to turtlebeach.com and read the knowledge data base, clicking and then shut off. I think that this is a common issue with these headphones which inturn makes them unuseable but not defective.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|I love this app because It helps me with know which element is made by which. and it also help me with the table of elements.

Also if i findyself not able to sleep this app helps my mind settle down from the day to day

B004UID2LC|5.0|I LOVE this app. Its great for general video viewing but you can also download songs for offline use! it basically works as a legal free music downloader.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a great download. there are so many different types and kinds of games to play. there is something for everyone in the family.
B000002JSR|5.0|This is critically the most bashed set of music by Zeppelin.I find it fun listening to in a way only a true die-hard Led Zeppelin fan could.The sound on it was produced in the more advanced age of recording so it sounds really good.It's just a neat cd to listen to with music that never got airplay,though I remeber Darlene getting scant airplay back in the early 80's.
B003L1ZXCU|5.0|Didn't know what to expect going in and loved every minute of it. Not only that but the second book is as original as the first and adds a whole different layer to the story unlike many formula driven series. I highly recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I would regimens this game to friends and family. some of the games I had a herd time getting by but you will have that with any game you play.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I just wish they made the games cost less points.some of these games are impossible to beat. a lot of the games are.fun
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was a five star read for me for two reasons: It was so well written, with such a page-turning plot that I could not put it down, and because I'm still thinking about it days after I finished it. I acquired fascinating insights into the American legal system, prosecution and defence, from a pro. The court room drama could have been dry and tedious, but it was riveting. I guess it really shows when someone writes what they know so well -- and this was with style, drama and pure magic. I'll start trawling for some of Mr Landay's other books....
B000FC10MU|4.0|This is my first novel by Gaiman I am a huge Sandman fan so of course I needed to venture out into some bigger works of Gaiman.  This book did not disappoint in the least.  I love mythology, and the thought and idea's in this book are well written, and well...thought out.  Makes you do a lot of thinking while reading and wondering, I like when a book entertains and makes you think at the same time.
B004EPYZUI|1.0|Unbelievable movie.<br /><br />From start until 20 minutes to end, it was an excellent movie. I was already putting together my glowing review of it. Then they almost literally defaecate on your plate.<br /><br />They get you involved in the characters. They get you involved in the plot. They give you a fantastic series of (CGI)sets to enjoy the allegories. It was fantastic. Then the last 20 minutes they say \\"we interrupt your movie to play the end of another one that has absolutely nothing to do with the one you were just watching\\". Worse actually. They serve you a wonderful 7 course meal and for desert they pump your stomach. Suddenly things that happen in the brothel world have no relation to what is happening in the real world.  Where before where everything in the brothel was her copping with what was happening in the real world suddenly there were killings in the brothel world for no other reason than to force an ending that had nothing to do with what every single second prior had been leading up to.  Zero.  None.  Not even the same movie or characters.  Childish games of \\"psyche\\" have much more meaning than the end of this movie.  At least with kids you know it's to be mean.  I can't imagine the writers of this were trying to do that.  So nothing makes any sense about the end of the movie and will have you ranting in frustration for a long time to come.<br /><br />Do.<br />Not.<br />Waste.<br />Your.<br />Time.<br /><br />Michael
B004JN1CW4|4.0|I felt \\"The Death Cure\\" by James Dashner was a really great book that kept me on the very edge of my seat and made me view humanity in a new light. The ways some of the favorite characters of the series handled the new situations were upsetting and at times heart breaking, but I suppose neccessary to the plot of the story. It had an interesting ending that made me want more, despite the fact that it was the finale to the series!
B0026FCNK2|1.0|\\"12 Monkeys\\" is a great movie and should not be missed, but this Blu-ray has issues.  I gave it as a gift to someone with a 2010 model Samsung player, and the movie is unplayable in the device.  He was able to get a second disc from the manufacturer, but the new one did not play, either.  Some research uncovered that many Universal discs, including this one, do not play on Samsung players.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fantastic book!  After finishing this book it made me hungry for more!!!!!  I read all three books but loved the first the best!
B003MC5N28|5.0|I read this not to long ago and it made me hungry for more. A must read for anyone as long as you can take death and unimaginable rules.<br /><br />I will not give out any spoilers. Read for yourself, you will NOT regret it.
B007V9YF5E|3.0|A perfect example of having all the right ingredients, yet still getting an average pot of soup. \\"Haywire\\" looked promising: Good director? Check. Fresh new lead actress (Gina Carano) who is a real life mixed-martial artist that does her own stunts? Check. Well known/dependable supporting cast? Check. David Holmes of [[ASIN:B00005RTFG Ocean's Eleven]] fame even did the soundtrack, yet somehow that went wrong too.<br /><br />This is a spoilerless review, and if you want to get a sense of the plot the main Amazon review above does a fine job. The movie itslef gets stuck sometimes trying to be a modern day version of the 70s tv show \\"Baretta\\", while other times attempting too much Bond like international intrigue. The end result comes across as mixed genres and ultimately falls flat.<br /><br />Towards the end Carano has her longest fight scene of the film, set on a gorgeous beach as the sun begins to set. What could have been a great opportunity to showcase her talent instead comes off as terribly staged and hokey. You know she could really kick your butt, and maybe it's partially because Ewan McGregor looks like he couldn't defend himself against an overly aggressive girl scout, but everything from the multiple cutaways to the lighting is wrong. This is arguably supposed to be the dramatic conclusion, but when the scene is shown from a multitude of angles it comes across more like the director is desperately trying to find the one shot that might actually work. Other parts of the movie feel the same way, including a very cardboard like performance by Bill Paxton as Carano's father.<br /><br />Worth seeing once? Maybe, it does have several good moments early on, and Carano is a real talent we'll no doubt see again. A good rookie effort for sure. But the movie itself is only a charitable 3 stars.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Really like this game, gives a new spin!!Angry Birds is one of my favorites.<br />Hope you like it as well as I do.
B004T2QZL8|1.0|you combine elements to make more elements to combine into... more elements. what's the point? am I missing something?  is there an actual game that starts later? Also forces close consistently after 37 elements on HTC Rezound.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Game isn't bad but it constantly asks me to provide a review - I'm hoping doing so will stop the annoying prompt
1594744769|3.0|I got hooked into this book right away and thought it was going to be great!  I was thinking it would be by far the best $3.99 I ever spent.  But then, it went in a completely different direction than I thought it would.  The whole multi-tongued monsters and colorless-eyed killers bit was way too bizarre for me.<br /><br />It kept my interest, but was far from the 5 star book that I initially thought it would be. I was bummed...this book could've been great.  But if you can get it on your Kindle for $3.99 and you have some time, I guess it's worth the read.<br /><br />I had no issue seeing the photographs on my 2011 edition Kindle.

0545403359|5.0|Great book to read, can't wait to see the movie! I would recommend this book for all ages to read!
B0007OY2P8|4.0|I really like this version of Northanger Abbey.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is that music they chose for background.  This music did not belong.  The story took place just before the 1800's began.  This music is for a story set in modern times, why I said it took place just before the 1800's is that Henry told Catherine that the marquess husband was guiltioned last year.  I totally believed Katherine Schlesinger as Catherine.  Peter Firth was a perfect Henry.  Also Robert Hardy as the father, not at all like the kindly vet he played in All Creatures Great and Small.  He also played another Austen character in Emma Thompsons Sense and Sensibility as Lord Middleton a complete opposite to this one, proving himself to be quite a good actor.  Of course it is not in the same league as the 1995 Pride and Prejudice, which is the best adaption of them all, but still I recomend this, just ingnore the modern background music and just enjoy it.  I of course did.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I've always loved this game! Was so happy when it came out for free on Amazon apps. Didn't know it had the bonus games after each episode...they are fantastic! Thanks for a great game, and great experience.
0439023521|5.0|I wanted to see the movie and i decided to read the books first from past experience i always read the book first before the movie so i'm not disappointed in the movie when i see it or vise verse. so i recently read the first book the hunger games online and while the book had its flaws i still was able to love it for its flaws, i'm not a big fan of first person narrative for i think it doesn't cover a full range of emotion or motive as third or slip narrative can bring to the table but i found myself actually loving that it was just the point of Katiniss while sometimes i found her a bit cruel and unfeeling i just think of himself in that situation and how i would probably abit heartless at times just to not go insane, i also found myself wanting to sometimes to know what was going through peeta's mind but that only because he was my favorite character because i saw me as peeta because i'm alot like him and i would do anything to save the person i love and i felt sorry for him when he found out i was all a big act to her as far as he knows because i truly believe she does love or she would have went through all the trouble of trying to disconnect herself from him, at times i found myself shouting when she was always saying she was doing the things she was doing was because of the camera and saying \\"No, come on! your really doing this for yourself!\\". i also thought that from the big controversial book that i was gonna be haunted by it but blood and everything the arena wise no i wasn't and maybe that's because i watch a quite a bit of horror movies but i was haunted by the fact that i c was affected by the book so much since i'm not affected by words so much like i am of images (which is way i am a movie person as not so much a book person even thought i read quit a bit) that's way this book will be going into collection as all my other book i actually own have affected me in the past. i actually felt like crying at Rue's death and i rare cry or feel like crying atbook or movies alike so that's a big deal for me. All in all while this book had flaws it actually worked in it's advantage which doesn't always happen and i can't wait to read the others as well as see the movie.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I got to original Cut the Rope as the free app of the day and loved it. When this popped up, I couldn't pass it up. This game rocks!<br /><br />It's buttery smooth and plays just like the original. If you liked the first one, you're going to love this one. New levels and new ways to feed candy to Om Nom. Don't hesitate. 99 cents? Pfft, well worth the pocket change.<br /><br />EVO 3D.
B000N3T0DW|5.0|I thought this film was very provocative and honest from the director's standpoint, and entertaining.  Excellent acting from Penelope Cruz and the entire cast.
0736684565|4.0|Jackdaws is an exciting espionage thriller set in World War II with a bit of a twist: it's about a team of British spies operating behind enemy lines, who are all women (including a couple of lesbians)...well, and one German transvestite.<br /><br />The heroines are very interesting (particularly the transvestite), but Follett's greatest achievement in this novel is perhaps his villain, a German interrogator in charge of rooting out and breaking up the French resistance.  He is not averse to using extreme brutal torture to extract information if necessary (and there is some very graphic violence in the novel, but with the Nazis as a subject that's pretty much inevitable), but he is extremely intelligent and would rather use trickery or emotional manipulation when those methods would serve the purpose.  In fact, he finds the methods of his fellow Nazis rather distasteful.<br /><br />At the same time, Follett portrays the lead heroine, Flick, as somewhat cold and steely, willing to kill the enemy in cold blood to protect her mission.  Many writers today would use this juxtaposition to insinuate that the Nazis weren't such monsters as they are often made out to be and that the Allies were just as brutal and vicious.  But in Follett's hands, the Nazi interrogator's supposed \\"scruples\\" are clearly rank hypocrisy which only serves to highlight the atrocious nature of the ends he pursues and the means he employs, while Flick's actions are underlain by a righteous determination not to suffer the guilt which rightly belongs to the aggressors against whom she fights.  Very well done.<br /><br />Kate Reading's narration of this audio edition is excellent, bringing out the emotional depths of Follett's story.  I would definitely recommend it.
B000A2W1X2|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  I just loved it.  Have given it as gifts to many friends who have told me the same.  A beautiful love story.
B004JQN364|5.0|I've often thought whoever makes the Papo dinosaurs should make a dragon.  I have the aligator mutant, tiger, lion and sheep (?) mutant figures.  The lion had a bad eye the tiger had no white paint on it, the aligator is perfect; but this Dragon Guy is the best.  He has a movable lower jaw.  His spear has a dragon head detail.....  The painting isn't perfect, but does not detract from the over-all spectacularness of this piece.<br /><br />Highly recommended but I still think the Papo guy should make a dragon.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Ive been doing this workout for almost 2 weeks now and already see a difference in my stomach and arms. I lost  few pounds as well.. but when looking at my body it looks like i lost more than that. My husband commented on how flat my stomach looks now. I also do a calorie reduced diet.<br /><br />Jillian is very motivating and I love all 3 levels. I actually alternate all 3 day to day so that I dont get bored. I did do level one for about 3 days and then started to alternate. I love how she modifies some of the workouts for beginners and for those who are more advanced. I do take 5 second breaks just to sip water because sometimes I need it especially doing level 3. If you need to take a drink break I think its fine. she does say in level one..if you need to get  a drink do it now but she doesnt recommend it often. I think I take 2 -5 second breaks.
1400069289|4.0|For me, this was, qbove all else, a consciousness raising book in at least two ways.  First, it makes one reflect on the fact that each of our lives is largely composed of one habit after another - some good, some bad, some neutral. Second, it dissects the way way habits work (the habit loop) in a clear, memorable, and persuasive way.  In short, for every habit there is a cue (or trigger), a routine, and a reward.<br /><br />For communicating these two facts alone,this book is well worth the read, and well worth the price.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I fault this fine book on numerous counts.<br /><br />First, he talks about \\"keystone habits,\\" a rich concept, indicating that there are some habits  which, as it were, give birth to other habits.  In this regard, he specifies that for some people a habit of regular exercise tends also to be associated with better eating and drinking habits.  He also says that the habit of making one's bed in the morning is a \\"keystone habit,\\" though he never mentions what other habits it tends to spawn.<br /><br />I would have like to have seen this concept of \\"keystone habits\\" concept get far more attention and analysis.  But it is lacking in this book.  And therefore one is left to wonder what makes a habit a \\"keystone habit,\\" etc.<br /><br />Second Duhigg appropriately identifies AA (Alcoholic Anonymous) as the leading habit changing organization in the world, which indeed it is.  But being a person with personal and successful (so far) experience with AA, I found his treatment of what makes AA the incredible success that it has been for the last 75 years underwhelming.  AA is a mine of wisdom about habit change for which Dugigg barely scratched the surface.<br /><br />Third, in my opinion, his treatment of Paul O'Neil at Alcoa, and Rosa Parks in the civil rights movement suffered from the \\"post hoc, propter hoc\\" fallacy.  How, in short, does he know that O'Neil's focus on \\"safety\\"at Alcoa is what made that company so successful under his stewardship, or the fact that Rosa Park was a well-known and well-liked volunteer in numerous charitable organizations is the key to why her refusal to change her seat on that bus in Birmingham explains why that event sparked the civil rights revolution.  Who knows?  What is freely asserted is freely denied.  To me, neither of these stories, nor neither of the latter two sections of this book (the sections on business change and on social change) were compelling or persuasive. They were nice stories, but nothing more than that.<br /><br />But by far my main complaint against this fine book is that in his helpful presentation of the \\"habit loop\\" - cue, routine, reward - he does not pinpoint which of these<br />Proxy-Connection: keep-alive<br />Cache-ConProxy-Connection: keep-alive<br />Cache-Control: max-age=0<br /><br />ol: max-age=0<br /><br />0D<br />of Proxy-Connection: keep-alive<br />Cache-Control:<br /><br />three items needs to be the initial or primary focus for anyone wishing to change a bad habit.  I found Duhigg's emphasis on diagnosing the \\"cues\\" or \\"triggers\\" that stimulate habits as well as his equal emphasis on dissecting the exact nature of the rewards that one gets as a result of indulging in a particular \\"routine\\" (i.e. habit) to be quite helpful. But I was left waiting for a more exact \\"first focus on this, then this, then this) explanation of the process of changing a particular habit.<br /><br />Still, this is a valuable book.is stewardship, or the fact that Rosa Park was a well-known and well-liked volunteer in numerous charitable organizations is the key to why her refusal to change her seat on that bus in Birmingham explains why that event sparked the civil rights revolution.

B003EYVXVE|5.0|One thing I couldn't help thinking, while watching the movie, is just how much the movie seemed lika a republican paradise! You have people who are literally dirt poor, from many \\"districts\\", far - far away from the wealthy. The super-clean and extremely wealthy use the poor for growing their food and generating their power and oh yeah - \\"entertainment\\"! Brutal and bloody entertainment to satisfy the sadistic needs of the upper class. This movie reminds me of a high-tech futuristic fusion of reality tv and bloodsport in the great coliseums of the Roman empire! glad it's just a movie. At least for now!<br /><br />I only watched this movie because im a fan of Jennifer Lawrence and im soooooooo glad I got my ticket. The gritty hardcore nature of the film is the kind of style I gravitate to just like when I watch the first 2 minutes of Battlestar Galactica(circa 2004). I've been hooked ever since and now im hooked on the Hunger Games!<br /><br />I loved every minute of \\"The Hunger Games\\", and I can't wait for more to come!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Whatever you do, do not buy all three books at once like I did. Yes, it was a pretty dumb thing to do I admit it. I watched the Today Show (thought they were a legitimate news show) and heard all the gushing and automatically assumed I was going to love this series. I did not. Awful is too mild a word to describe how bad these books are. It was too repetitious (the words, the sex scenes, the lip biting, her inner goddess speaking), too many Brit phrases no American college girl would utter, misspelled names, etc. If you find you must read it, then at least buy them one at a time. If you love it, that's fine. If you don't, you can always return it since Amazon has a return policy. If you choose not to return it, at least you'll only be stuck with one unwanted book instead of three.

0307957934|5.0|Dr.  Alex Hoffmann, formerly of CERN, has written a computer program that automatically places financial trades based on information that the program gleans from the internet.  The program, VIXAL-4,  becomes more robust than even Dr.  Hoffmann expected and begins to intrude on Hoffman's personal life.  Or is it just that Dr. Hoffmann has problems with paranoia?<br /><br />This \\"science runs amok/psychological thriller\\" was right up my alley.  \\"The Fear Index\\" has an element of science fiction, some financial components, some mystery and some international intrigue.  There is nothing too deep here.  It's just the same sort of fast-paced fun you find in a \\"B\\" movie.
0307716988|5.0|The book was awesome in the book it talks about his childhood his sucess and depressed when going up I really i enjoyed this book it was worth it.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|I've noticed that people have called this film \\"Rocky with robots\\" but I think that this film is more of a combination of the Rocky films with another Stallone film \\"[[ASIN:B0007TKNKG Over the Top]]\\" in which with Stallone's character Lincoln Hawk tries to connect with his son after years apart from him and the two become a team of sorts.<br /><br />Granted there are some rather cliche moments in \\"Real Steel\\", but overall this is a good film. Due to some violence, I wouldn't want young children to watch it but this is good entertainment nonetheless.

B005LAJ1O0|5.0|American Horror Story is and will be my favorite show since \\"House MD\\" and \\"Breaking Bad\\" are ending this year which makes me sad but now since I started watching season 1 AHS, I cannot wait till season one is out on DVD and then Season 2 starts up! I think my favorite episode was #3 \\"Murder House\\" because...well I'll let you watch it and you'll understand why! The show takes all the the good elements of every classic horror movies and tv shows and mixes them together but the creators manage came up something original. Season 1 of AHS had school shootings, a haunted house, a creepy neighbor, and a burn victim bashing a pregnant to death a shovel. I don't how season 2 gonna top that but I'll have to wait and see

Now, my little dude can watch whichever he wants on iPad or iPhone, we have the regular versions in small tv, and the blu ray versions for the home theatre. For $50.<br /><br />The packaging is abysmal and disappointing. It looks clever at first, but its next-to-unusable and highly unpractical. This is a five-star collection in one-star packaging.<br /><br />Then again, the awful packaging is maybe why it's only $50? :-)
B006OCM0G0|1.0|I think Amazon should not do business with the developers of this app. It came close to tricking me within five minutes of playing into spending my own money ($9.99) on gems (which is the only way to accelerate the boringly slow game), instead of the virtual game money. Never happened before to me in an app, and I consider these developers extremely unethical in the way they choose to make money off this game. Put ads on it or charge $0.99 like everyone else. Uninstalled.

1612130283|1.0|Considering the basis of this story and all the character personality traits and background info comes from stephenie Meyer the author of twilight don't waste your time purchasing this book! It was originally a twilight fanfic with Edward and Bella and she barley changed anything besides the names! I can't believe she can even get away with publishing it and making money off another author! Also since it was a fanfic just google master of the universe or Motu and there u go free and all Edward and Bella with the same unedited mistakes that are in the published version.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Its cool enough but only when connected to wifi. Its fun but syncing is a pain. Would be better if could play offline. You dont have to buy anything at all to use this. Its repetitive but sooo addictive. I dont think kids would like it much other than watching the people pretend to eat kids arent going to wait for the food to be done and try to time it just right liketeens and adults do so i dont understand all the negative reviews from ppl saying their kids are buying in game currency. If the kid does not understand not to read the pop ups or click ok on everything they see then they probably arent old enough to be playing these types of games and in the product description it tells you that its possible to buy these. There are some good apps to kidproof you tablet if you are afraid and need to lock it and turn of wifi like you do for the kindle fire

0061726826|4.0|okay i like dystopia novels,at first this book was rather boring and slow some pages i even skipped over. i think Hana would be a better main character although i think the author was trying to create a person most of the audience could identify with in some ways i could with lena but she seemed so weak and mindless. but in the end is where the book got alot better im waiting on the next book to this trilogy im hoping thAT Lena isnt such well a loser in the next one and she grows some fire in her or something..Also i hate to think of lena as a plain jane maybe a under rated beauty?? I see plain ness every day in reality id like to read about beautiful vibrant things!and unfortunatley lena is not in this book that would better fit hana her best friend I identify with Hana more kinda rebelious no parents around and a feeling of people dont understand they just go along with out question. But I do like Alex lena's love intrest i hope in the next book there maybe some of his point of view in things..any way slow in the begining but in the end it made me want to read the second one also i wouldnt mind watching it on screen ;) tootles

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a great book. I could hardly put the book down. I found myself reading on my tablet at home and on my phone when I was out. I found any excuse to pull off from what I was doing so I could keep reading. I recommend this book for anyone looking for a good science fiction read.

B004IFYMWK|3.0|The able acting and excellent script and storyline are undone by the most excessive, unnecessary shakey cam, hand-held camera style shooting ever recorded. This style seems useful to me as a way to communicate short scenes of action or confusion, but it gets downright annoying with Fair Game... This is a political suspense docudrama...not an episode of office or Nascar...wtf?!? I got a headache watching Valerie Plame's head bob in and out of my screen. Complete imitative nonsense.<br /><br />What a pointless exercise.

1451627289|5.0|I've both fanned and panned Stephen King throughout the years; I've fanned him for his almost uncanny ability to create the voice of his characters and take us on amazing journeys. I've panned him in the past for the idea that he may have been paid by the word, rather than the book. I've often said that Mr. King is an author who can say in 100 words what most can say in ten. This *is* a long book, but you don't begrudge him one word. They're all important.<br /><br />Lack of concise writing aside, he is more often genius than not. A man as prolific as he is cannot be expected to win them all, but he definitely hits it out of the ballpark with this book. The characters are once again the interesting, quirky, sometimes hateful, but always all too human characters we've come to know and expect from Mr. King. The pacing may seem to be a bit slow, but it's only because you're sitting there going \\"come on, come on, what happens next?!!\\"<br /><br />It does have some dark and disturbing parts, but not as many as a lot of his books do, not even as much as The Stand, which I consider his other great triumph (so far) along with this book. Kick back, and take a trip through Mr. King's version of history; the good, the bad, and the ugly. This book is the closest most (or all) of us will ever come to having that elusive time portal Mr. King writes about in this book. And, according to the book, that's probably for the best!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Originally Written for The Blog Entourage<br />[...]<br /><br />Reviewer's Book Blog Wickedly Bookish<br />[...]<br /><br />I read The Hunger Games two years ago and have read it many more times since. It is the only book I can truly say I will never get tired of and by far, my favorite book ever. I've recommended this to fellow readers countless times and I'm going to do the same again now. Read this book. Now. Read it before you see the movie, which inevitably will change key elements in order to save on time and keep the rating PG-13. Now, if you've just read this last part and are wondering if this book is appropriate for your kids, I would say The Hunger Games is safe for your older teens to read. If your child under 15 wants to read it, I suggest reading it yourself and then formulating your opinion, and here's why.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is set in the post-apocalyptic ruins of what used to be North America. In this dystopian future, the continent is split up into twelve districts, all controlled by the tyrannical Capitol. Each year, in order to display the Capitol's power, one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and thirteen are chosen from each district to participate in the Hunger Games on live television. The winner of the Hunger Games, and there can only be one, will be set for life! Vast wealth, fame, and an opulent home in their district's champion's circle are the prizes and all they have to do is be the last one standing. Yes, this is a fight to the death. A survival of the fittest and if one of their fellow tributes doesn't kill them, there is a good possibility they will die of starvation, dehydration, or exposure. Happy Hunger Games everyone, and may the odds be ever in your favor.<br /><br />So, right now you're probably thinking, \\"That's terrible! How barbaric! Why would I want to read this?\\" Well dear reader, because it is exciting. The action is engrossing and the deep emotional pull you will feel while reading not only draws you closer to the characters, but also makes you consider the themes on a deeper level. Sure, it's a disturbing concept, however much of popular literature and film are based around the concepts of overcoming disturbing situations and hardships. Think Gladiator, Independence Day, and The Dark Knight. These situations make us band together as humans in a fight for our most basic rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I dare you to look over the reading for any high school English class and find one book or play that doesn't include disturbingly cathartic themes. Romeo and Juliet, Lord of the Flies, The Odyssey, Julius Caesar, Hamlet, and Animal Farm all of these books are being read across the nation by our teenagers and all have arguably more disturbing concepts than The Hunger Games. So I challenge you dear reader to open up your mind to something that is so much more than much of today's brand of superficial young adult literature. This book will force you to think, to grieve, to love, to pity, and to cry out in triumph for humanity.you consider the themes on a deeper level.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|And immerse yourself in the Game of Thrones. It is an epic series along the order of The Lord of the Rings series and/or The Harry Potter series, with the exception that in this one, very little magic is used. It is a brutal, unforgiving show, mirroring the time, the landscape and the people it portrays. Do not get attached to any character, as it seems none are so essential they cannot be killed off, suddenly and without warning.<br /><br />You will come to care for these people in spite of yourself, and you may even find yourself questioning right and wrong at times, as you watch the characters fight for their lives and their loves. It is a gritty hard-core portrayal of a dark and hard society. The Game of Thrones brings its characters to life through a raw and unforgiving lens. It's difficult to watch at times, but even more difficult to look away.
B005IQZB14|5.0|A different kind of hiker narrative. Had read Skywalker's entertaining tale of his journey on the Pacific Crest Trail in the midst of 'the bubble' of thru-hikers. But this is a deeper, more Chris McCandless-like journey, albeit one with a a happier ending. Cheryl Strayed emits and brilliantly describes the most fundamental human characteristics, including an abiding love for the outdoors.<br /><br />Definitely the type of book to get you off one's duff and out of your comfort zone.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Before I begin my review I would like to make one thing clear: I don't like Blu Ray. As far as I'm concerned, movies are not real life and the closer they get to looking like real life the more the magic slips away. That being said, I know 99.9% of Americans disagree with this opinion so I am going to write my review from the perspective of someone who would want the highest definition possible.<br /><br />This is without a doubt the most comprehensive and complete release that Star Wars has ever gotten. Obviously, EVERYTHING isn't included (It would be hard to include a piece of Darth Vader's lightsaber in every package ) but it is a fantastic placeholder for whatever movie-viewing platform comes along next decade. You could spend literally days going through all the goodies are included on just one bonus disc, which include but are not limited to deleted scenes, concept art, high-definition turnarounds of actual movie props, documentaries on those props, featurettes on nearly every aspect of shooting the films, and more. In other words: There isn't a collection in the world that has so much Star Wars goodness.<br /><br />Then there are the films themselves. The picture is so clear that you could conceivably be looking through a crystal-clear window into another universe, and the sound is crisper than you've ever heard it before. Of course, there are changes, but is an extra \\"No\\" in Return of the Jedi really going to ruin the entire Saga for you? Sure, it's annoying and should be edited out in all future releases, but it's a small blemish on an otherwise awe-inspiring presentation of a classic Saga. Besides, the other improvements are just that: Improvements. For example, the horrible Yoda puppet in The Phantom Menace has been removed and replaced with a CGI character that has 110% more emotion and feeling than the pupet ever did.<br /><br />Then there is the presentation. Each film has a gourgeous menu with scenes from the movie floating across the screen and an iconic musical score playing in the background. The discs themselves come in a cardboard booklet that allows you to store what otherwise would be an ungainly pile of discs with all your other Star Wars media. Each page of the \\"book\\" has gourgeous artwork that captures the essence of the movie you are about to watch.<br /><br />Overall, my advice is to purchase this set. Even though it isn't the final, perfect Star Wars release, it is extremely good and will most likely be the best format for watching these films that we will have for a long time. Whether you are a die-hard fan of the franchise, an all-around movie buff looking for the best presentation of classic films or a regular Joe looking to experience a piece of cultural nostalgia, this set is a must-buy.

0439023513|5.0|I've found on here that many are dismayed with the ending of The Hunger Games trilogy. My advice? Read it again in a year or two. Maybe it's going over your head. Or re-read it right now, with a friend. I read the entire trilogy in a week, and even at the age of 19 I found some themes were hard to understand or keep track of -- not just because of authorship, but because I was reading too quickly, was too tired, or needed to talk it out with someone. Luckily, my boyfriend read them with me and I had him to bounce ideas off of. Being able to discuss the book really helped with comprehension. I am a girl who loves books, don't get me wrong. I read all the time. But a friend always helps.<br /><br />I have to say, I am very glad I read these books now, when I'm older. This is not a love story. This is a commentary on two starkly different political systems and a commentary on a soldier's mentality during war. Many complain of Katniss' helplessness. They complain she lost her strength and simply herp-derp'd through the last book like a robot. Alas, she did not. I know that I, at the age of 17, would not have been able to handle being the mascot of a bloody rebellion and potentially have my hands covered with the blood of thousands. Katniss was as strong as she could have been with everything hanging on her. I admire her greatly. Katniss Everdeen is the strongest fantasy heroine that girls in this day and age can find. Collins' story of a teenage girl from District 12 who has a habit of shouldering more than she can bear and over coming it is very feminist friendly. Girls, look to Katniss when you need strength, even in Mockingjay.<br /><br />***SPOILERS***<br />There are a few specific moments I would like to shed some light on.<br /><br />1.) Prim's death (and any other death that was seen as \\"heartless\\" or \\"cruel\\" or \\"unnecessary\\"). This was not a ploy to get rid of Prim. It is clearly indicated in Mockingjay that the bombings on the children and then on the medics were of rebel origin. Snow did not have anything to do with it and admits that. Prim's death was Coin's last stand to break Katniss, something she had been attempting since all 13 Districts united. Coin wanted a martyr to have the rebels to fight for. She wanted to revel in Katniss' glory without have Katniss stand as a political threat to Coin's seat as President. Since Peeta didn't succeed in killing Katniss like Coin wanted, Coin intentionally allowed Prim on the front lines to be killed in a carefully planned bombing by the rebels. This did, for a time, break Katniss. But not in the way Coin intended. It made Katniss hate Coin more. Haha, Coin didn't bet on Katniss finding out it wasn't a Capitol scheme.<br /><br />Deaths like Finnick's are an example of the sacrifices that go on during a war. When Finnick stayed behind to save Katniss from the muttations and walked into his certain death, Katniss had no time to mourn him. She either had to keep moving, or suffer the same fate. I imagine this to be similar to what it is like on real front lines. No matter who it was, your best friend, your brother, your sister, your cousin, you keep moving. Survive now, mourn later. No one can blame Collins for not dwelling on the deaths that occurred in battle. The book is written in first person -- we see everything from Katniss' eyes, and think everything she thinks. If she didn't dwell on it, neither did we. We are left to mourn him and others like him on our own time, just as Katniss is.<br /><br />2.) Katniss and Haymitch agreeing to Hunger Games for Capitol children, as suggested by President Coin. This, I thought would have been obvious to most, but by reading reviews I can tell that it went over some heads. Let me explain. Katniss agreed to the Capitol Hunger Games because she wanted Coin to trust her. Coin has done everything she can to get rid of Katniss so far, other than kill her outright. Katniss was not about to give her a reason to try anything more, and wanted tolure her into a false sense of security with agreeing. When she votes, she says, \\"Yes, for Prim.\\" Because she is avenging Prim's death by planning to assassinate Coin. Coin is no better than Snow. And it seems that no one could see that but Katniss and Haymitch. Haymitch trusts Katniss, and is very much like her, so he affirmed Katniss' brewing plan by agreeing to the Capitol Hunger Games, all the while building a last strand of trust between them and Coin.<br /><br />3.) The assassination of President Coin. I've read reviews that have said this is \\"wasteful\\" or \\"not thought out\\". Really? The woman who bombed innocent children and then her own medics, then suggested a second wave of Hunger Games with even more innocent Capitol children? If I was Katniss, I would not have let her take power, either. She was just as power hungry and corrupt as Snow was; her only saving grace was that she was the Commander in Chief for the rebel forces. She needed to go. Snow was on his way out anyway, and Katniss knew that if she didn't kill him someone else would. So she took the only chance she got. And WHOOSH there goes Coin, only to be replaced by the leader from District 8, a far more fair and capable woman.<br /><br />4.) Gale/Katniss/Peeta Love Triangle. This is something that Mockingjay wraps up beautifully, however it is extremely complex and what I say here will only scratch the surface. Gale and Peeta represent two conflicting ideas, survival and love, respectably.  In order to survive in the dystopian, warring environment of Panem, one must forsake love for survival. Katniss couldn't be with Peeta while there was war because she had to worry about survival, and she couldn't be with Gale while she was in love with Peeta. Something to note is that she was never in love with Gale.  She clung to Gale only when he was in pain, when she was in danger of losing that which contributed so greatly to her survival.  The ending wraps up this triangle in that it shows the true colors of the two boys.  Gale leaving to take the job in District 2 is the final nail in the coffin in painting how selfish he truly is.  Peeta stays in District 12 with Katniss, despite the painful connection to that district, his final act of selflessness.  Love can be tangled with the urge to survive, and this book explores that confusion.<br /><br />To conclude this review, I just want to reiterate some below reviews: THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. Way too violent! I would not recommend anyone below the age of 14 or 15, maybe even 16 depending on the maturity of the child, to read this series. The three increase in violence and darkness rapidly. Mockingjay is the fantastic finale and leaves the reader satisfied and smiling. Picking up this series out of sheer curiosity was the best decision I've made since picking up Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone when I was 10 (although those two series are no where near alike, I just want to stress how near and dear to my heart Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay are). The struggles of the Districts, the lives of the characters, and the over-arching themes are something that I just couldn't put down. I loved Mockingjay. Loved it. There could not have been a better ending to The Hunger Games. All in all, I recommend this to everyone who wants to take a stab at it and doesn't have a queasy stomach. And it's feminist friendly, to boot.

B001TODO54|4.0|This book was amazing. It was about a girl finding out she wasn't something to be afraid of, she was good. It was kind of like a violent love story, that makes you feel like your right there with the characters.
0765365278|5.0|Really good read. Plenty of mystery to keep the reader going back even after finishing the book to find out what's really been going on in some of the other chapters.  Plenty of world-building through action.<br /><br />Small detractor:  found Shallon's plot to be too decoupled from the main plot to be very engaging, but I'm sure it's being set up for something interesting in book 2.
B007G5K066|1.0|It hurts to write this, but my favorite movie of 2011 has gotten an awful region A blu-ray treatment. About a third of the package is devoted to TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY. The rest contains adverts for investing in blu-ray and NBC. Two of the features on the main menu are dedicated to showing off the features of blu-ray and if your blu-ray player is connected to the internet, a ticker streams adverts for NBC Universal properties. I use my PS3 and most of the usual buttons don't function as they should and if you leave the movie on pause for about two minutes or more, it starts playing a screen saver of the Universal logo that can only be turned off by hitting a particular button. It's also excluding a number of special features that are on the UK blu-ray. Apparently it's more important for fans of LeCarre to watch NBC's Smash at 10/9 central, than to have anything relevant to the movie on the blu-ray aside from one or two specials. The coding and design of this blu-ray is unspeakably bad and for such an incredible movie, I can't believe I'm even considering sending this back. Focus Features has an amazing track record with producing quality movies and they deserve better DVD and blu-ray treatment.<br /><br />As for the quality of the film itself, there's a distracting amount of grain that seems like it might have been a stylistic choice, but it's really distracting when it shows up. This is a beautifully photographed movie and I wish the images were more clear.<br /><br />In spite of all the shabby treatment, TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY is an incredible movie and I hope it gets a proper release one day.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Fun, but it is too short and needs to be $0.99 max price or make a free version, please?<br />;)
B006JPS1OM|5.0|Just got this game for my Kindle Fire and it loaded just fine and works well. Some have complained about the difficulty of tapping to get items. I use a Boxwave Slimline Stylus that I bought at Amazon.com and have had no problems at all. I use it all the time and it makes all typing and tapping a breeze. The game is fun and like the hidden object games I am used to playing, it can be frustrating when you can't find an item, but that is part of the challenge of these games. Being able to pinch and enlarge scenes and move them around made all objects accessable.  Like the ones I play on my laptop, turning the screen sideways or upside down can make it easier to find items.  My prior experience with Big Fish games of this type helped me to know where to look for items. This game is on par with some of their games and considering it is for my Kindle, I am pleased so far with this.  If no problems arise, I will be getting the full version.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I just finished the last book in this trilogy today. This trilogy has subject matter in it that I have never read before but I absolutely loved and enjoyed it. I absolutely loved Christian and Anastasia. All three books was an emotional rollercoaster. The ending to this trilogy was satisfying and deserving for both the characters especially for Christian.
B007FH9GT2|5.0|First I have to admit, I did not read the book!  I made an attempt once and put it down and forgot about it!  I was hesitant of the movie!  However the movie was good from the start!  Very intriguing and a great \\"who done it\\" story!  I was feeling a bit lost in the beginning but letting it play out, it all comes together!  I was warned by a co-worker that there is a vulgar sex scene, it was a bit disturbing but knowing this going into...it didn't bother me!
B006CDCWDM|2.0|I admit to being a big fan of Feds and not rooting much for Rafa until the Djoker made his move last year.  Although Rafa has enormous talent, this book focuses on his mental approach to tennis and life, which is guts, determination, and family.  The book confirms and elaborates on these aspects of Nadal, and it should be of interest to tennis fans everywhere.  However, it falls short on charm and is somewhat myopic in its focus, much like its subject.  I much prefer other tennis books, like the ones by Gilbert and Sampras.
B007N5YIUS|2.0|The ads in this game are quite annoying. Their placement often blocks much of the game objectives. They're also very large.

B004T2QZL8|5.0|I love this game. It is an awesome alchemy game.<br /><br />NOTE: Why r people describing the game in their rating? Just put this instead
B00003CX5P|5.0|This movie, along with the whole second trilogy, receives a lot of hate for not being as good as the original trilogy but I don't see why people don't like this movie. I think that it does an excellent job of explaining how all the main characters first meet and how their relationships start off. There were also several key connections made, like the fact that Anakin built C-3PO. That may have already been known through books or something but if you are just watching the movies, that's the connection of C-3PO.  I thought all the relationships with the characters were strong and you could really see how Anakin fell for Padme and how Anakin even got to become a jedi.  Lucas did a good job with setting up the very beginning of the story and introducing the supporting characters, like Qui-Gon. All cheesiness aside, this movie has something for everyone.  There are a couple of pretty intense fight scenes and then there is the whole podrace. These scenes add some action to an otherwise serious movie.  There is also humor in Jar-Jar and although most people hated his character, I really enjoyed him.  He played the roll of goofball which is something that every movie needs.  Overall, this movie was very well made and is possibly one of my favorites in the saga.

0316017930|5.0|I wasn't expecting much of another success story; however Malcolm gives such a straight forward and pseudo-scientific approach of how people achieve success, that I'm still \\"in shock\\"!<br />Great book, cannot go to sleep....
0307352145|5.0|I loved the book and convinced my library to purchase the ebook. It is not meant to be a psychological text on the main \\"types\\" (introvert/sensitive, etc.), but a more populist/cultural look at influences in our Western cultures and how they can persuade an introvert that they are somehow \\"wrong.\\" I found the facts, historical examples, data, cultural comparisons and case studies fascinating. The whole book rings true. It also helped me understand my own tendencies more, as well as how to manage them in the face of today's business demands. It has lots of practical advice.<br /><br />In addition, I recommend it to all teachers and those who work with (or have) children. It offers insights into behaviors that might worry us, and it challenges many of the assumptions of progressive vs. traditional schooling. If you want to do the best by your children, this book will help you to do so.
B005LAIIS0|5.0|I love horror movies but know what to expect. I expected this to be like all the others where yes it's good or maybe great but not fantastic. Well I honestly walked out of the theater more then impressed at how FINALLLLLLYYYY!!!!!! there's a horror movie even at my age that scared me an made me jump. Even the story was semi believable. I enjoyed the plot an personally liked the characters cause your always going to have a bad guy amongst the bunch that mixes things up and makes the situation harder. If you love werewolf movies then your in for a suprise cause whats sad this is better then any werewolf movie i've ever seen an it's only about a very large pack of wolfs. I would highly reccomend two thumbs up an all of us who went are planning on purchasing this the day it comes out.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I didn't know what I was getting into, having downloaded this from the library. This is not my usual type of fiction. I was able to quickly bypass the more explicit scenes - they don't really interest me - but I thought the storyline was sort of interesting. Unfortunately, what really bothered me was the fact that this was a British author trying to write American characters, and she completely gets the voices wrong. The characters are constantly using expressions and mannerisms that are very British, obviously so if you have ever lived in or visited England, or even read British chick lit. Even worse, she tries to throw in expressions that are stereotypically American, and the two types of speech do not blend well.<br /><br />This book has obviously been publicized, so there must have been a budget behind it. Too bad the budget did not include an editor who could identify and help the author change the very frequent turns of phrase and tone of the book that are far too British for an American character. Even better, she could have just made the main character a British ex-pat, and that would have solved everything. As it is, I found the incongruities far too distracting for me to enjoy the book.
B002RKSXJG|5.0|I offer a strict review and not a description of the story. This is one of the best books I have ever read. Full of intrigue, uniquely written, and true to the mid 19th Century England setting, I don't know why  it took me so long to stumble upon. A must read, especially if you enjoy historical novels!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It's ok. Seen better, seen worse. It is free and the games help occupy down time. And I'm writing this review for some extra points.
B0052VUNHC|2.0|I can't really be bothered to write my usual style of review. I'm the last person on the planet to read it, so summarizing the plot just seems a waste of time. Instead, I'm going to skip straight to my criticism.<br /><br />First off, if you don't like first person narration, this is not the book that will change your mind. It uses the device particularly poorly. Our narrator, the heroine, at times has too much insight into the minds of others and at other times has too little knowledge of her own mind. None of her personality comes through in the narration. She just describes what she and the people around her did, using a flat, emotionless sort of voice. It was like the story was written in third person then run through a find/replace to switch the pronouns. Abby thinks bizarre things like:<br /><br />  \\"I looked down to my plate, letting the long strands of my caramel hair create a curtain between us.\\"<br /><br />and mangles grammar like:<br /><br />  \\"Kara was reading ahead in her brand-new books, grimacing at America and I when we walked in.\\"<br /><br />Secondly, I think this early bit of characterization says it all about Travis:<br /><br />  \\"He had tattoos on opposite sides of his chest, and black tribal art covering each of his bulging shoulders.\\"<br /><br />Since tribal tattoo = dirtbag, the fact that he's a misogynist jerk didn't surprise me too much:<br /><br />  \\"I don't promise anyone anything, Pidge. She didn't stipulate a relationship before she spread eagle on my couch.\\"<br /><br />I stared at the couch with revulsion. \\"She's someone's daughter, Travis. What if, down the line, someone treats your daughter like that?\\"<br /><br />\\"My daughter better not drop her panties for some jacka** she just met, let's put it that way.\\"<br /><br />Nice sex negative message there, don't you think? Abby the virgin is a good girl. All of Travis' past one night stands are referred to as \\"sl*ts,\\" \\"bimbos,\\" \\"wh*res\\" and \\"Barbie dolls.\\" Abby joins right in with Travis on the shaming, making it plain that the sexual double standard isn't just a character flaw of Travis', it's an assumption that drives the narrative. Women who enjoy sex are dirty sl*ts who don't deserve respect in this story's world, and that's some sad internalized misogyny.<br /><br />Next up is how Travis is a textbook abuser archetype. He never hits Abby or any other woman in the book, but he exhibits every quality present in your average domestic abuser. He has a violent temper when he doesn't get his way:<br /><br />  \\"He took a swing at Shep when he found out we helped you leave. Abby! Please tell me!\\" she pleaded, her eyes glossing over. \\"It's scaring me!\\"<br /><br />The fear in her eyes forced only the partial truth. \\"I just couldn't say goodbye. You know it's hard for me.\\"<br /><br />\\"It's something else, Abby. He's gone f-----g nuts! I heard him call your name, and then he stomped all over the apartment looking for you. He barged into Shep's room, demanding to know where you were. Then he tried to call you. Over, and over and over,\\" she sighed. \\"His face was...Jesus, Abby. I've never seen him like that.<br /><br />\\"He ripped his sheets off the bed, and threw them away, threw his pillows away, shattered his mirror with his fist, kicked his door...broke it from the hinges! It was the scariest thing I've ever seen in my life!\\"<br /><br />He's possessive, even after Abby's broken up with him:<br /><br />  \\"I love you. I can't let other guys dance with you.\\"<br /><br />He's quick to violence when he feels he's been insulted:<br /><br />  \\"Travis lifted Finch's tray off the table and swung it into Chris' face, knocking him off his chair. Chris tried to scramble under the table, but Travis pulled him out by his legs, and then began to wail on him.<br /><br />Chris curled into a ball, and then Travis kicked him in the back. Chris arched and turned, holding his hands out, allowing Travis to land several punches to his face. The blood began to flow, and Travis stoodup, winded.\\"<br /><br />And, most importantly, he sees nothing wrong with his behavior. I'm not a sheltered delicate flower. I'm a hockey fan who has been in her fair share of scraps over the years. I don't think a violent temper necessarily makes someone a predator. What makes Travis a predator, to my mind, is how his violent attacks on people outside the fight ring aren't treated as a personality flaw. These actions are not only not condemned by the characters or narrative, they're actually held up as examples of his love for and devotion to Abby. Viciously bloodying an innocent bystander's nose is treated as a heroic act.<br /><br />All that said, had this book ended at its halfway point, I think I would have begrudgingly given it 4* for being a cracktastic trip back to college to stroll down Bad Life Decisions Lane. It encapsulated the self-centered, impulsive, emotional and dramatic whirlwind that is young adulthood in a way adult contemporary romance does not. I know, as someone who graduated from college more than a decade ago, that Travis is bad news and that Abby's a head case, but college is the time for bad behavior. I would've liked an indication from the narrative that they were all screwed up and/or getting away with something, but it was seductive to go back to a time where you didn't know any better and you felt free to take crazy risks.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the author seems to have been unable to part with her characters and spent the second half writing her own fan fiction where Abby and Travis have Adventures! and break up and make up along the way. There's a beyond bizarre trip to Vegas that comes out of nowhere. Abby's father is pointlessly introduced and forgotten about in an abrupt fashion. There's a throwaway sub-plot involving a mobster and a brush with death just to seal the deal. Where the first half of the book follows a nice dramatic arc, the second half is a half-witted sine wave shamelessly stalling the HEA. Bleh.<br /><br />In the end, the gratuitous violence, misogyny, poor writing and uneven pacing team up to make this a sub par read for me. I'm not going to wring my hands over the terrible message this sends to YA readers, because I don't think fiction works on people like that, but neither can I enjoy something with such glaring negative themes in it. McGuire has a knack for telling a story, but I can't ignore the flaws in this to enjoy it. 2*up, winded.\\"<br /><br />And, most importantly, he sees nothing wrong with his behavior.

B004RJMUJO|1.0|The new March 2012 update erased all my achievements. And to top it off it is now full of ads disguised as rewards. I'm uninstalling it.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This game is impossible to beat. The HD looks amazing on the kindle and the overall game is perfect and I cant wait for the update!!
B005CWRB44|4.0|I recently purchased the [[ASIN:B005CWRB44 Fenix Compact 140 Lumen Flashlight]], the [[ASIN:B0050PN9H6 4Sevens Mini 123 R5 Edition]] and the [[ASIN:B001H4I7GM Fenix PD20 CREE Q5 Mini LED Flashlight, Black, 180 Lumens, Uses 1 X CR123A Battery]] to replace my SureFire Executive E1 for EDC (every day carry).<br /><br />All of these flashlights were brighter, lighter and smaller than my vintage E1.  The one I setled on for EDC was the [[ASIN:B0050PN9H6 4Sevens Mini 123 R5 Edition]].<br /><br />Since I won't be writing three entirely different reviews, let me tell you what I like and dislike in a EDC light:<br />* It has to be something I always have with me - thus the term EDC.<br />* It has to fit on a key chain (something that my SureFire E1 did begrudgingly)<br />* It has to be small, light and have at least low, medium and high settings<br />* It is preferable to have a dedicated on-off switch to a twist-on switch.  This is because I don't want the light to turn on accidentally and not be ready when I need it.<br /><br />Much less important to me are things like strobe, SOS, beacon, and so on because of two reasons: first they are invariably difficult to activate (strobe coming to mind as the most useless in a tactical situation) and second, the additional weight and cost isn't justified since it's unlikely I'll ever use them.  Follow me on this: is this the primary use as a flashlight or a signalling device?  For me it's simple: If it's dark, I want light and I want that light to be on my person.<br /><br />In order from most to least preferred for EDC, the following:<br /><br />#1 - [[ASIN:B0050PN9H6 4Sevens Mini 123 R5 Edition]]<br />It's small, lightweight, bright, inexpensive enough and fits on my key chain.  It has more than the three brightness modes I require and despite the twist-on activation was the best suited to my needs.  This light turn on low, then medium, then high.  This means that you have a day or more to notice your light has been accidentally turned-on.<br /><br />#2 - [[ASIN:B005CWRB44 Fenix Compact 140 Lumen Flashlight]]<br />All of the above and 25% less expensive than the 4Sevens.  Same twist-on activation BUT this one turns on in high-output first - cycling from high to medium to low.  The problem here is that accidental activation will discharge a battery in an hour and I might miss it -- unless of course I felt my pocket getting hot.  I deemed this light unsuitable for my purposes and gifted it away. :)<br /><br />#3 - [[ASIN:B001H4I7GM Fenix PD20 CREE Q5 Mini LED Flashlight, Black, 180 Lumens, Uses 1 X CR123A Battery]]<br />This light has a positive end-cap on/off switch and is the brightest, best quality and most expensive of all.  The light is simply too large for EDC on a key chain.  It is about 50% larger than the other two lights.  It's also considerably heavier.  This light I carry in my laptop bag where an ounce or two doesn't make much difference.<br /><br />On the subject of twist-on lights I don't like them for several reasons: accidental activation, wear on the o-ring and wear on the threads will all shorten the lifespan.<br /><br />As far as being made in China or the USA goes for warranty purposes, I just don't care.  If the light works when I get it then I'm good.  If it fails, I'll buy another.  I'm not going to ship a low-priced flashlight back to China for warranty service.urned-on.<br /><br />#2 - [[ASIN:B005CWRB44 Fenix Compact 140 Lumen Flashlight]]<br />All of the above and 25% less expensive than the 4Sevens.

B004SJ3BCI|3.0|this game is awesome but I rate it 3 stars because 1 it doesn't have the mighty eagle, 2 it doesn't have the new update surf and turf.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great storytelling style. A bit slow in the beginning for character development purposes. Once you get to know the characters the author has a way of making you feel for them, whether it be hatred or sympathy. You find yourself \\"rooting\\" for certain ones. This book is gripping. I bought the whole trilogy on my kindle and I find the story hard to put down... unless my battery dies. Buy the books you won't regret it.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|space angry birds is so fun!!!  it needs more levels though. in the first hour I beat the whole thing with 3 stars. But I know there will be updates and more levels coming soon. it also is a little pricey. I recommend u get it.
B004UXUX4Q|2.0|This is a video was waiting to recieve.  It came on a very timely matter, however I was very disapointed while watching the video it kept going in and out with a black screen.  I have never had a dvd video that I purchased ever do that.  Is it possible that I have a DUDE.  Your response will be greatly appreciated.  Mahalo, Thella Asing
B007MNV5WU|2.0|not big angry birds fan but nothing beat the original angry birds, this game is sorta fun but kinda dumb
B0000695JO|5.0|You almost have to have seen it when it 1st came out. This is a classic car chase movie from the 70's. The music is far out and the counter-culture scenes are cool. Every character fits the time period. The rebel driver, the cops, the drug culture of the time and the racism/prejudice is as it was then. The whole thing is about the Dodge Challenger and the great car it was. I saw it in a theater and this DVD was exactly as I remember it. Thanks for the memories.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|great game for when you just wanna chill out and create a neat restaurant with no stress oramything really serious

0545265355|5.0|I bought this boxed set for my wife and she loves it, then we went to see the first movie, and we both agreed it was a huge disappointment, so now I need to read them as well, so I can make sense as what I have watched, but from what she told me about this book, it sounds amazing!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|i love this app it is so beautiful and relaxing. both quell apps are qreat for both me and my 6 year old.
B0064NTZQ2|3.0|This is the movie of a getaway driver / wheelman by night and a normal average movie stunt driver by day. The movie kicks off with a slightly suspenseful non action getaway sequence. No explosions, no gunfire. It shows how smart this guy is at getting away when compared to other movies like the Transporter and Driver with Dwane Johnson.<br /><br />The movie has an 80s vibe from the pink cursive text, to the synth pop music in the background to the star Ryan Gosling's scorpion jacket. It is a really nice vibe... but now for the negative. A lot of the movie, probably the first hour is acting through standing there motionless and saying nothing. There were a few times that I thought my DVD player had stopped. Nope it's just them standing there doing nothing. No camera movement at all.<br /><br />For the most part, the story follows Ryan's life outside of being a getaway driver and his boss who gets a stock car funded by two mob men played by Ron Pearlman and Albert Brooks. The driver meets his apartment neighbor, an attractive woman with a kid. He falls for her even though she has a husband in jail. The driver even appears to be out of the getaway driver game without bluntly stating \\"that's it I'm out,\\" like other movies. I'm sure you can guess what happens. The husband gets out and then there is a twist that brings Ryan back into the driver life for one last score. That's when I feel like the movie really begins... an hour into it.<br /><br />This has a low budget when compared to other driver movies like the Transporter and it seems like most of the budget went to funding brutal scenes of when someone is killed. Very nice and graphic. Shocking for a movie that has zero motion and movement. Maybe that's what the film makers thought... we want to bore people as much as possible so that when we show brutal scenes of violence they take notice of them!<br /><br />Overall, it is probably not even worth a watch due to how slow it is for the first hour. Even after it pickedup it is still pretty slow even if it is graphically violent. It will be terrible to see on network TV that cuts out the graphic violence yet keeps in all of the dull scenes of him standing like a log waiting to get a glass of water...
B001U0V82S|3.0|I love to read and very rarely put a book down but I had a hard time staying interested or excited about this book.  I decided I will finish the book after reading other stuff so maybe when I finish it I will appreciate it more.

B003EYVXV4|5.0|My daughter and her friend read the books, and I had as well. I loved these - even as an older reader. I was following the development of the movie and was a little critical thinking the actors would be too old - based on the book, and how it made me feel.<br /><br />BUT - books are books and moview are movies. I loved this and really enjoyed my daughter and her friend being able to discuss their views. It had action, drama, romance, and I can see how part two is called for. Loved Leny in there, what a treat.<br /><br />It would have been nice if there was, for example, and old wise person speaking some lifelong philosophy to drill in deeper thought - but perhaps the overarching series will do this. Very interesting how this movie (and book/s) came out just before the uprising in North Africa and the Middle East. I may be looking to deeply - but can't help but feel some coincidental parallels. Fantastic timing.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|A fantastic game completely ruined by your save profile randomly getting deleted, super draining on battery, and long load times.
B002NT3B52|5.0|This book was wonderful!  I learned so much about my own three dogs and love them even more.  I play with them a lot more now.  Every dog-lover should read this book.  Or I should say, every dog-owner!  Many people have a LOT to learn.<br /><br />My thanks to the author for writing this fabulous book.  My book club is reading it now.  We will discuss it at our next meeting.  How fun!
B007N5YIUS|2.0|At least the load screed looks nice. That's all of the game I've seen. Loads, goes  to black, then crashes. Stellar job, Rovio.
0446547654|2.0|This book was really a disappointment. It's very sad that people get so stuck in the past they can't move on esp their high school past.  Amanda was very obviously unhappy in her marriage so she should've left long ago.  I know she didn't want to for the kids, but what example does that teach them, stay in a loveless marriage for the rest of your life.  Also her telling Dawson that she always wished to be with him even before she said her vows, that's like a slap in the face to her kids.  My Mom told the same thing to me.  Her and my dad divorced but told me years later that she longed for someone else from high school the whole time they were married and I was pissed!<br /><br />So I'm not a big on stories where's someone's miserable in their marriage and instead of seeking couples counseling or even getting a divorce, they go off and have an affair and even worse continue to stay in their marriage.  Dawson should've respected her being married even if she was miserable.  Also when her son nearly died, it was her husband's fault. I didn't blame her in the least for lashing out at him.  That should've been the final straw in their marriage.

0385534639|5.0|I wont summarize this book Bc I'm sure many have. I just want to say that I believe some reviewed this book badly Bc it didn't fit into their mind how they think a book should be written. personallyy I think this was a bit of fresh air. I loved the details and trying to see how all the events and ppl went together. I thought the beginning was a bit slow but I loved the ending. I say give the book a chance and see for yourself.
B005H29GSI|4.0|The game is super simple to play. You draw a card from 4 piles and build the structure the card displays. With the 4th pile you build a custom structure based on what pieces the card says you can use. Once the structure is built you fling the birds in the order they appear on the card. Only the Yellow and Red (really fat bird) have been included in this game. If you knock down all of the pigs then you earn points based on the level, where level 1 is 100 points, level 2 is 200 points, etc. The first player to reach 1,000 points wins the game.<br /><br />The concept of the game is great, bring the Angry Birds experience to the real world. Allow us to have a tangible attachment to the Angry Birds universe. In these regards the game succeeds. You'll quickly get wrapped up in the levels, enjoy it when you knock over all of the pigs with 1 bird, and rejoice when your skills bring home the points you need to win.<br /><br />However, the execution of the concept is very poor. The problems with the game are not how its played but how the pieces have been formed from plastic. The designer behind this game didn't put much thought into how the virtual renditions would actually function in the real world, with real people setting them up, etc.<br /><br />Here are the issues, the pieces are not solid all the way around. The ice is solid on 5 sides, where the back side is open. This mean you have only a few possible ways to arrange the ice. So if the card calls for a piece that lays on its side, you have 3 options (top, bottom, front -- in most cases). The solid front and back are great because they offer the greatest surface area. Using them it is really easy to stack and build the level, but these side are also the most secure. So this means that it is much harder to knock over the pieces. If you try to stack two bits of ice top-to-bottom you can end up with one open side touching a solid side, which makes for some real patience testing as you try to get the pieces to stack up so that you can start enjoying the game.  The long wood pieces are solid on 4 sides, what would be the top and bottom are concave-ish or pressed inwards. This \\"concave\\" area has the logo for the game, and it makes no real sense why they did this. When you attempt to stack two of the wood pieces top-to-bottom it is next to impossible to get them to balance as the edge which makes contact is an just around 1mm thick. So picture a 1mm edge balancing on another 1mm edge and then you are expected to stack more on top of that. Now imagine trying to stack the pig onto this pile. The gap in between both sides, the \\"concave\\" area with the logo, is just as wide as the pigs base, which makes it next to impossible to pull off some card designs in a normal time frame. You could always go with the flat side but then the level is really hard to knock over and you end up playing for much longer than perhaps your patience can stand. Also, some designs clearly expect you to stack using the difficult sides. Good luck pulling these off on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th try.<br /><br />Another issue with the design is the TNT box. I've played the game for somewhere around a total of 10 hours with different age groups. In all of our sessions no one has ever been able to explode the TNT box. Half way through playing someone always asks what it is supposed to do and I'll show them by dropping it from about 24 inches. If you are expecting the TNT box to actually explode outwards and cause destruction, you'll be disappointed when you actually get to use it in a level.<br /><br />For as poorly designed as the pieces are (with their open ends making it near impossible to stack some levels) they are well built. I tend to play on a 1/8th thick board on the floor, but I imagine that the pieces should hold up pretty well if they were to fall from the height of a table. I could imagine the ears of the pigs breaking off, and this would make it impossible to fit on the little hats, and also the TNT box breaking. So perhaps take caution and play closer to the floor as we do.<br /><br />The bottom of the slingshot has 3 screws. I'm not curious enough to open it up at this point to see how it is made. I'm wondering if there is a rubber band in there? My worry is that the slingshot will stop working one day and when that happens the game could no longer be played. The slingshot itself feels pretty sturdy but it doesn't work as you would think. It is actually hard to get the in between powered shots that are required to hit the levels from the recommended 12 inches away. The sling shot always feels either under-powered or overpowered. When you pull back what seems like it would be the right amount the bird ends up flopping down right in front of the sling, when you pull back what feels like it is to far the bird will fly almost straight up and drop right down or fly over the pieces. Again, that middle ground takes some getting use to and most people I've played with have had a hard time dialing in the slingshot. What seems to work the best is a combination of the distance the pull back the sling and how quickly you let it slide from under your finger.<br /><br />Overall the game is pretty fun once you get it set up and working. It will test your patience as you try to stack the poorly designed blocks or shoot the birds from the slingshot that doesn't work as you would have expected. The game is worth picking up if you can grab it for a good price. I got mine for $8 during a sale at a local store and I don't regret it. But the retail sticker on the box says $22.99 and I can't imagine feeling like I would have gotten my moneys worth if I had paid that much!<br /><br />One final tip to close out this little review. When you are forced to stack the pieces on their 1mm thick sides, with more stuff on top, followed by a pig (and it happens more often than not), try stacking on small angels. Place the first piece flat side down, so it is sturdy. Then place the second pieces endto end but on a slight angle, so the corner sticks off just a bit, this will allow you to stack it more easily. The top will then be a flat side so that you can further stack more stuff or place a pig. Good luck... and remember, the game should be fun! =)

To summarily break it down to numbers, I would say if the author or editor had trimmed the fat 465 pages by say, 100 to 125, it'd be a better book.  (Not that long books are bad, as I'll get into.)  At about page 250 I actually put the book down for a month, not sure if I cared to continue.  The reason: nothing had happened in 250 pages.  When I finally did pick it back up, something finally did happen; on page 253, there was finally a positive step into the mystery story of the book, thus it finally got interesting.  But to Larsson's credit, I had kept reading it up to just before that point.  There was something simple, easy, and compelling about his narration that kept me going.  Okay, I admit, I am a somewhat impatient reader (impatient in general, but my reading time is very limited and valuable and this was maybe not worth all the hours it absorbed).  It was not the \\"definition of page-turner\\" as I was led to believe, to say the least.  Of the 465 pages, only about 150-200 of them directly dealt with the primary mystery story.<br /> But that's not bad in itself.  The good thing about the novel as an art form--which we, including myself, in these hard-and-fast, short attention span, flash-bang, more quantity-less quality times seem to lose--is that is doesn't have to be just about a single linear plot, as does a short story or two-hour movie where the delivery has to be relatively short and sweet.  I am glad there is still success out there for the meandering, developing novel that weaves an entire world and doesn't have to be pressured into getting it done fast and dirty (just ask Stephen King, perhaps the most successful and time-taking writer out there).  However, that said, this book meandered more than really necessary.  The first 50 pages were mostly about doing generational research on a family while drinking a lot of coffee and having sex with the villagers (okay, just one villager).  There was more day-to-day, mundane detail than needed for the story.  It was not page-turning, nail-biting suspense.  The primary characters were thoroughly wrought with their own ins and outs and developmental episodes (which is good), to the point where the murder mystery plot line was secondary, or at least no more important than any of the other lines running in this book (which isn't good).  Other running lines include the characters own lives, the operations of a magazine, the financial ruin of a bad guy and his giant corporation, as well as criticizing the modern financial system and highlighting crimes against women (and very good points made there!).  Something else that struck me as strange was the author (or at least the character Mikael) seeing hackers as about the most despicable form of criminal; he almost seemed more taken aback by Lisbeth's computer habits than by the rape and murder of women.  Perhaps that's a cultural thing, or a journalist's bias.  The author's experience and interests as a magazine editor himself definitely shows through and maybe other editors got more enjoyment from those details spend throughout the book than I did.<br /> Overall, not a waste of my valuable reading time, but it sure as hell did not live up to the hype.  Read it if you have time to spare.  If you're pressed, find something more quality-dense.er).  There was more day-to-day, mundane detail than needed for the story.

1439181780|1.0|This review relates to the audiobook - Rhonda Byrne's voice is so annoying, and the sound effects so terrible, I couldn't finish listening to the CDs.  Her \\"Power of Love\\" concepts are too simplistic and unrealistic to be believable, this book was an insult to my intelligence.  I agree with other reviewers who think she just wrote the book to make more money and rip off readers of The Secret.

B0032UYFA6|5.0|Stop now, if you are concerned about \\"spoilers\\"....<br /><br />Though I recently watched all episodes of all four seasons in quick succession, I'd been left wondering where series creator Vince Gilligan was ultimately going and what sort of moral statement (if any), he was trying to make.  A NY Times piece has provided much insight:<br />*\\"Walter White was a sympathetic innocent when AMC's descent-into-darkness television series, 'Breaking Bad,' began in 2008, a cancer-stricken chemistry teacher who -- ostensibly to support his family -- began to manufacture crystal meth....The premise of the series..., following Walter White's transformation from a decent man in desperate circumstances into a ruthless drug lord, always seemed made for a short run....what Mr. Gilligan wants before the series ends, is even more bleak: to remove all vestiges of likability from Walter White, to complete a transformation unlike anything a television series has ever tried....'I actively wanted to create a TV show in which the main character transformed from who he used to be into what he eventually will become. That's not how TV series are usually designed. The idea is to have your character remain pretty much who they are, sometimes for decades on end. I wasn't interested in doing that'....'All the characters bear the weight of their choices'....'This is not being dark just for the sake of being dark. These are people whose worlds are crashing in on top of them. It's heavy, heavy stuff'\\" (Shattering All Vestiges of Innocence, NY Times, 7/15/11).<br /><br />There is apparently detailed research done for this show:<br />* \\"season three kicked off in March 2010 with a startling first season in which two ominous-looking cartel hit men...park their luxury car on a dusty dirt road and drop to the ground in their silk suits, joining the tens of villagers who are dragging themselves on all fours toward an adobe hut....the...assasins approach a life-size statue of Saint Death[sic], address her in prayer, and then affix a penciled sketch of Walt....and ask the skeleton saint[sic] to help them 'do justice'\\" (Devoted to Death: Santa Muerte, the Skeleton Saint[sic], pp. 160-161).<br /><br />The above-described scene led to my reading \\"Devoted to Death: Santa Muerte, the Skeleton Saint[sic],\\" a poorly done work which seemed to infer that this \\"devotion\\" is an acceptable part of Catholicism.  A brief article by Michelle Martin seems to provide theological background for what Gilligan was attempting to portray:<br />* \\"Santa Muerte, translated 'Holy Death' or 'St. Death'....has become a favorite patron of narco traffickers carrying drugs across the Mexican-U.S. border, where shrines to her can be found along the roadsides. Many, if not most, of her followers call themselves Catholic.  But Santa Muerte is no saint. Saints, after all, are real people, not personifications of a universal experience, who are living with God in heaven, according to the [[ASIN:B00635I88C Catechism of the Catholic Church]]. They can be intermediaries or intercessors with God....Santa Muerte, her followers believe, grants favors on her own, and not all of them are the sort of favors that people think God would approve of....Some people are willing to abandon Santa Muerte when they understand what she is, and is not. Others need more catechizing to understand why they cannot be good Catholics and offer prayers to death, the last enemy that Jesus defeated\\"(Our Lady of Guadalupe Battles \\"Holy Death\\" for Devotion of Mexican Faithful, Our Sunday Visitor Newsweekly, 2/19/12).<br /><br />Understanding what Gilligan is trying to convey, I believe that this show has the potential to convey the profound message that each of our moral choices shapes our characters: \\"I actively wanted to create a TV show in which the main character transformed from who he used to be into what he eventually will become....All the characters bear the weight of their choices\\" (Shattering All Vestiges of Innocence, NY Times, 7/15/11).
B003Y5HWMW|1.0|Imagine shelling out $40-$50 for a movie (on sale, mind you...), then investing a little over 6 hours watching that movie, just before the 4th DVD in the set doesn't work due to a combination of poor quality control, pathetically strict copyright protections in the form of DRM and cheap dvd formatting. That is what you will likely get if you waste your money on this garbage.<br /><br />I decided to spring the $45 for this DVD series because it was on sale and looked interesting. The actually story itself isn't half bad, though it's not particularly good either. However, the mediocre entertainment value isn't the reason that I gave 1 star. I got through the first three discs okay -without a single hitch even. However, on the fourth disc, when I put it into my BD player (PS3), I got an error message saying that this BR-DVD couldn't be played, kicking back an error message that translated to DRM copyright protection. Mind you, the first three played without a problem. However, because I'm not the type that can just watch half a story and call it quits (even if that story is mediocre -at best), I restarted the DVD about 15 times before it finally started to play. However, every ten seconds or so, the audio would go out and the scene would freeze. I tried to restart it several more times before ultimately returning and replacing it. A week or two later when I finally had the replacement, the same thing happened, only this time with disc 5. After returning that one for a replacement, disc 3 on the replacement suffered from the same problem. It is clear that most of these DVD sets are going to have at least one corrupted disc, which will make it impossible for the potential buyer to follow the story. In fact, it will potentially frustrate the watcher beyond belief.<br /><br />I can't help but to think that if I ever didn't something like that, or anything really that the movie studios didn't like, they would surely get their pound of flesh out of me -or anyone else throughtheir government lackies. The reality however, is that the movie studios don't have to worry about pleasing the customer, as they have you by the *****.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend wasting your money on this dvd series, unless of course you don't mind getting half-way through a story and never be able to finish it.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|After hearing the \\"buzz\\" about this book on a few national news shows, I thought I might enjoy it. Unfortunately, this story did not \\"do it\\" for me at all. The story was way too much like a porny-version of Twilight for me; The female lead character is abused by the male lead character, and has absolutely no brains in her head to see that this is wrong and she should leave. She has a nice male friend (with a \\"J\\" name even) who would be better suited to her but her jealous domineering boyfriend won't let her near him.<br /><br />I couldn't relate to this weak, simpering woman and I wanted to beat the crap out of her abusive boyfriend, who the author painted as an angelic idol to be worshipped in this messed-up take on submissive relationships.<br /><br />Probably the worst part about it is that what little interesting plot points exist in this book are not resolved!! The ending leaves you with a trite \\"end of part one\\" so that you will be forced to spend more money to gain a sense of resolution. Well, no thank you! I'd rather not spend anymore time in this messed-up universe.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This app has a bunch of great features. It has just about every conceivable version available in addition to cloud-based notes, highlights, and bookmarks, for example. But the offline mode is awful. A simple highlight is impossible without an Internet connection. Given that this app will be used in churches, many of which don't have wi-fi, this is a serious oversight.<br /><br />Still, it is easy to use with only a few minor interface quirks. Had it been given a better offline mode, it definitely would have been 5 stars.
B000HKWCOA|4.0|This was a great series and it was a shame that people were not willing to give it more of a chance. Perhaps it was because they were portraying earlier less advanced humans and pre-federation. The only think I think they missed terribly was getting the series stuck into the temporal time line. Eventually it took over the whole series and ruined it. Enterprise series could have been saved had the writers, producers, and directors, gotten back on track of exploration (which should have been more important in Enterprise than in Star Trek: TOS) since we were new to the galaxy. That damn temporal time line became so convoluted even Captains Kirk, Picard, and Janeway could not have saved the timeline that many times (lol). Too bad they didn't get one more season to get back on track with some great stories. And there were some fabulous character stories left unwritten. Certainly enough for 7 seasons. My favorite character was Dr. Flox bar none. I felt Scott Bakula was perfect as the captain of the Enterprise and really think all the casting was great. But there was so much more the writers could have done to develop the characters instead of chasing the temporal time line. I felt the series was abandoned by not just the network but by \\"faithful\\" Trek Fans and we could have made our voices heard as to the story lines and the direction the series was taking. It is true that the network which picked up the series was not available to many people which hurt the \\"almighty Neilson ratings (which to me are a crock and do not accurately reflect a show's popularity)But had trekkies wrote in and voiced concern over the direction of the show, the creative teams would have repsponded. They know the loyal fan base and age group.<br /><br />My other major issue with Star Trek: Enterprise was that 80's Ballad intro. It just killled the show before you ever gave it a try. They should have killed whomever came up with that. It could have been changed by the second season to a beautiful Star Trek style orchestration and beautiful seniery. I will never understand why they did that. I hate that 80's Ballad Intro so badly that I skip over it every time. I lived the 80's and I didn't watch Star Trek to remind me of it. They totally missed it with the opening. Perhaps one day, they will re-release Star Trek: Enterprise with an appropriate Intro. (Here's a clue......go on YouTube and look at many that were created by non-professionals and pick out any of them and it is better than what we were given.) That 80's Ballad was hideous and did not set the mood to watch a Star Trek series. It was so out of character and I am a trained musician and understand this all too well. Which is probably why it is such a gripe that when they released the DVD's they didn't go ahead and produce and replace the horrible intro.<br /><br />In closing, this series should have lasted 7 seasons had they corrected where they went awry and not believed the lying Neilson ratings. Unfortunately for all of us lifelong Trekkies (I am 46 and have been watching my whole life every series and every movie). This was probably the very last Trek Series we will ever have and that is a shame. Many if not most of the original writer, producers, directors are gone now. And what we got left with was a Star Trek (2009) Re-boot movie by J.J. Abrams that abandoned everything Star Trek stood for. You could tell it was made for today's teenagers. There was nothing cerebral nor unpredictable in that movie and it was Star Wars set in the Star Trek universe. I was devastated at the horrible movie and what they called a re-boot was just the destruction of Gene Roddenberry's ideas. I will say it took me a long time to warm up to DS9 as it was far from my favorite series however, in hindsight it was fabulous but just in such a different way. And Star Trek needed the shakeup of the story line.<br /><br />LONG LIVE THE TRUE TREK IDEAS WHICH I BELIEVE ALL THE SERIES EMBODIED AND ALL THE MOVIES EXCEPT.............................\\"STAR TREK....THE RE-BOOT\\" which was a total failure and I will never go watch another \\"new Star Trek\\" until they return to the original concept. Again Star Trek Re-boot was nothing but special effects and fighting sequences displayed for adolescent teens and pre-teens. Not true Star Trek Fans. I would have given that movie a zero rating if they would let me.

0439023513|5.0|Well, I finally finished the trilogy.  Somethings I had predicted - others not so much.  I read several of the other reviews - good and bad.  I don't think I ever saw a chance at a happy ending for anyone.  The world was too badly scarred for that.  It seems that many of those who gave it a bad review were too unrealistic.  The world is full of sad endings.  The actual world, not just a creation of an amazing mind.  Find something else to read if you have to have a happy ending.  At least there is an ending whether or not you consider it satisfying.  It does the job.<br /><br />Be sure to read the books in order.<br /><br />I read them all on my Kindle.

0439023513|4.0|Suzanne Collins is working hard to push past her severe limitations as a writer here:  She attempts symbolism and metaphor and analogy, albeit briefly and lacklusterly.  The mockingjay here of course is the heroine, who must lead her people in an rebellion against the cruel and evil Capitol, which has enslaved them for so long.  What makes this book interesting is Collins' eternal and optimistic belief in the power of youth and love to overturn and renew old and malfunctioning systems.  The ultimate sacrifice that the heroine makes is deeply moving.

Readers who enjoyed this book would enjoy much more Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy.<br /><br />What makes this book so enjoyable for teenagers (I have no idea why adults read this) is that it mirrors so closely the emotional universe that teenagers inhabit.  In the Hunger Games, twenty-two teenagers have to battle it out in a last-man-standing contest -- and to do so they have to form and break alliances, and be cruel and cunning.  And doesn't that sound a lot like high school?

0385342063|4.0|I'm a huge chick lit fan so it's no surprise that I jump on Sophie Kinsella's novels as soon as they're released. I was lucky enough to snag a copy of I've Got Your Number from NetGalley (thanks Random House!) and I devoured it over a weekend.<br /><br />I've read all of Sophie Kinsella's novels and even a couple of her Madeline Wickham novels as well - even though I don't like those ones as much, weird. I always read her newest novels as soon as I possibly can but...here's the kicker...I always find her protagonists mildly irritating. But I still keep going back for more! There's something about Kinsella's main characters that just sometimes bug me. I usually find that her characters lack common sense and it takes awhile for them to work through their issues, but they always do. I think that's why I always go back to Kinsella because because things always work out in the end. Don't know what that says about me or Kinsella, but there you have it. Her characters annoy me but they're still loveable enough for me to enjoyt her books. Figure that one out :)<br /><br />I found that this novel had an different sort of plot to it. Yes, there was the typical romance and the issues that come along with that (this one was focused on having to choose between two very different men) but the other part of the story ended up focusing on a corporate scandal that Poppy ends up helping to solve. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty interesting and fun to see how the characters would sort through the PR nightmare, but for some reason it came as a surprise because it was in a Kinsella novel. I can't exactly explain it and I feel kind of bad as I feel like I'm stereotyping her. I do think she may be trying to get into slightly different kinds of stories, remember Twenties Girl? I found that one to be quite different than her previous novels. Not bad, just different.<br /><br />I didn't loooove I've Got Your Number but I know chick lit lovers will want to read it and I think they should. Idon't think they'll be disappointed and I think most will end up really loving this one. It's a happily ever after story which is why I will continue to go back to Sophie Kinsella, time and time again.
B001FB4W0W|3.0|You know how most people will comment on a movie, saying it's not as good as the book?  This is really true of True Blood.  There were so many changes from the book (yea, yea, I know, they have to \\"adapt\\" for the small screen) that I found some of the characters unrecognizable.  All the sex and nudity didn't bother me, except that it seemed they threw it in as often as possible so I found it tedious and would fast forward to get back to the story.  The books (especially the earliest ones) glossed over the sex, leaving it to the readers imagination.  You definitely don't need an imagination with HBO's version.  I don't hate the series, just got tired of it pretty quickly.  Guess I'll stick to the books, though even there Harris is beginning to lose momentum and is adding more and more bizarre story lines.  My recommendation - read the books.  They're fun for the most part.
B006ISJQ26|3.0|This movie had a great cast and great potential but just missed its mark and, missed the more interesting flavor and storyline of Ken Bruen's book. It (the movie) is English film noir and an interesting looking gangster flick BUT the screenplay took too many twists and WTF turns in the plot from the original book and left me shaking my head, wondering why whoever okayed the script thought it would work. It was good to see Colin Ferrel offering up yet another convincing role. It's just a shame he didn't have a better vehicle to roll with it.<br />  Do yourself a favor. Pick up Bruen's book, London Boulevard or anyone of his other novels and have a good read and you'll see what I mean. Ken Bruen's a writer of note while the adaptation of his book just didn't do him justice.

B003EYVXV4|5.0|To me, The Hunger Games is another chapter in, I hope, a never-ending series of popular, big distribution 'freedom and rebellion' books and movies - think of Star Wars, Firefly/Serenity, Avatar. Such movies and books place a mirror in our face and force us to take a good look at what and who we are and where we seem to be going. We read the books, watch the movies, some of us play the video games and maybe we feel good about ourselves because for a few minutes or a few days or months we 'get it'. Then we return to our real life and hibernate until the next installment arrives. Better than nothing at all and I was happy to see that half of the audience in the theater was made of teenage girls and boys, clearly hungry to experience a story of selfless sacrifice, survival, love of freedom and... love.<br /><br />The movie is as faithful to the book as any 2.5 hours movie covering a book can possibly be. From the point of view of someone who read the book (twice) it didn't take long to find myself immersed in the audio-visual rendition because a lot of what I saw was not unlike what I visualized for myself while reading the bool. Sure, some characters - Cena's crew, the mayor and his daughter - had to be cut out of the story, a couple of characters - Prez. Snow, Seneca - were more emphasized in the movie and there's a little spill-in from the second book in the series but it was all done honestly and gracefully and it was done only because doing so makes it easier for viewers who didn't read the books.<br /><br />The acting and casting are as close to optimal as they can be. Sure, there are some casting distractions - Katniss should not be taller than Peeta and Donald Sutherland is maybe too heavy of a presence for what should have been a slimy and sinister President Snow but everything blends to near perfection eventually and if noticing many in the audience wiping off a tear or two is an indication of immersive story telling then Hunger Games as a movie is very good at telling the story.<br /><br />Hunger Games is one of the not too many mass-market, big budget movies that manage to keep the audience alert and watching for 2.5 hours and leaving the theater feeling good about what they saw and talking about it. And it does so without a lot of CGI, very few explosions. Everyone in my family enjoyed the movie and we are all looking forward to 'Catching Fire' (part 2) of the series and surprisingly, not a lot of graphic violence. As for what's better: reading the book before or after watching the movie, not reading the book at all or not watching the movie if the book was already read... I am happy I've read the book before going to the theater but anyone who enjoyed the movie and hasn't read the book yet I'd say... read it. There's quite a bit more in the book because it's impossible for a movie to show 'everything'.t telling the story.<br /><br />Hunger Games is one of the not too many mass-market, big budget movies that manage to keep the audience alert and watching for 2.5 hours and leaving the theater feeling good about what they saw and talking about it.

B007KQ6XYY|4.0|It works well on my Asus Transformer TF101 (Ice Cream Sandwich) but there are occasional freezes. Not sure if it is the app or Asus's ICS which still have a few issues.<br /><br />As for the game, you get 5 \\"boxes\\" with 25 levels each. The first one doesn't introduce anything new - it is more like a review of what was available in the original CTR. Each of the remaining 4 introduced new play elements or new physics. It is as fun and addictive as the original. 5 boxes is too few, though. Hopefully additional levels will be introduced with updates, just like for the original CTR.<br /><br />I'm also a little disappointed that the HD version is Kindle only.

Its soundtrack works on so many levels, from the stuttering, pulsing instrumental core to the shimmering trance-like works culminating in the magnificent \\"real hero\\".  The entire soundtrack serves the film in an intense and insular fashion, but is so well done that it dares you not to like it on its own terms.  Grand, icy, romantic, throbbing, sexual yet sweet music that will haunt you after seeing the movie.  Highly recommended.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really enjoyed The Hunger Games a lot. Like most people, I had a hard time putting it down! It was a quick read (which is great for a mom taking classes and working). I always tell people it's the opposite of Lord of the Rings where Tolken might spend pages talking about a rock (ok, I know that's an exaggeration, but there were times when it truly felt that way). Collins gets right to the point and right to the story. My only problem with this book are the emotions of the characters. I have to keep reminding myself that this is a young adult book and that could be the reasoning behind it. Unlike Crime and Punishment where the main character went mad because of killing a woman, I feel that the characters in the Hunger Games hardly express any emotional response to killing other kids. I'm also surprised that there aren't teenagers who just sit and cry when the games begin or contemplate suicide. It's a horrific situation that these people are thrown in to annually and I just don't feel that the response of these children are accurate. But once I get over that part of the book, I find that it's a great story, wonderfully written for the type of book that it is, and one that I would enjoy reading again!

B003EYVXVE|4.0|There is always a risk when you watch a movie derived wholly or in part from a book, especially a book as popular as this intro to the Katniss saga that promises at least 2 more book and movies.  Will the movie be faithful to the book?  Will the characters be given time to be fleshed out?  Most of the time filmmakers alter much of the original concept because of economic, artistic or conceptual factors.  I have the advantage of reading the book but the disadvantage of not reading those that follow.  The book's author Suzanne Collins was closely involved in the production of the film, co-writing the script and has said she believes the film to be authentic.  So do I.<br /><br />Set in a future where continents are renamed due to some change in the political collective, Panem (North America) has been divided into 12 districts.  Each district has a specific purpose.  It could be agriculture or manufacturing or something else.  Each district is under the thumb of the central government that rose from a civilian rebellion some 75 years earlier.  District 12 is the coal mining region and the most poverty stricken.  In order to keep the population under control and entertained at the same time, an annual televised battle to the death is held.  This idea is similar to the gladiator games held by the Romans which was an inspiration for Collins.<br /><br />The combatants (Tributes) are chosen by lottery and only those between the ages of 12 and 18 are eligible.  One boy and one girl from each district.  The older you are, the more entries you will have.  Kind of like the NBA draft, only getting chosen likely means death since only one will survive the two week event.  A barely 12 year old girl is chosen in District 12, but her 16 year old sister and mother-like figure volunteers in her place.  Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is a strong, independent young woman who is also the breadwinner for her sister Prim (Willow Shields) and mother (Paula Malcomson, TV's \\"Caprica\\").  She is a skilled bow hunter and often hunts with her hunky friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth).  There is an underlying attraction but it is never pursued.<br /><br />Once the combatants enter the Capitol, they are treated like royalty in the few days prior to the games.  The boy from District 12 is a baker's son named Peeta (Josh Hutcherson, so good in \\"The Kids Are Alright\\").  He admits publically that he has always had a crush on Katniss but we're not sure this is real or just a publicity stunt prompted by the pair's mentor, Haymitch (Woody Harrelson).  The games become a battle to the finish but along the way, coalitions are formed by some of the participants.  Katniss, however goes her own way.  She's seen as a possible force due to her survival skills as well as her prowess with a bow and arrow, so is hunted by the collective.<br /><br />Ultimately Katniss joins forces with her district partner, Peeta and forms their own alliance.  The games' rules change when the two become closer and yes romantic, all in front of the large TV audience.  But is this real or staged?  The deaths are harrowing but not very bloody.  Some may rail against this restraint but I would argue that spears, knives and arrows don't necessarily result in copious amounts of blood.<br /><br />The strongest element in this movie is the character of Katniss as portrayed by Ms. Lawrence.  In the novel, she speaks in the first person so short of a voice-over narration, Lawrence must convey her inner-most thoughts, fears and emotions by her actions and facial expressions.  She pulls this off giving the audience a real connection to her plight.  In an especially touching scene, Katniss must say goodbye to a 12 year old competitor from District 11 who has been speared.  They had worked together earlier against the stronger collective.  Katniss, not one to cry, must suck it up yet convey her remorse.  Perhaps Lawrence's best scene.  One of the advantages of reading the book is that you better understand the relationship between Katniss and Peeta.  This might be a bit confusing to the viewer without that knowledge.  Appropriately the film ends with it unresolved as it should be.<br /><br />The film isn't perfect.  One of the book's featured events is the entrance to the arena similar to the chariot parade of ancient Rome.  Katniss as \\"the girl on fire\\" was underwhelming.  The mutations, wolf-like creatures artificially created, lack a certain element that was especially creepy in the book.  For some reason this was eliminated.  I also thought the use of the shaky-cam early on was a bit too much.  In short however, the film is faithful to the novel and to its fans.  It is well done, if not perfectly.  The strong performance of the actors, especially Jennifer Lawrence, elevates the film above the norm.<br /><br />Finally, \\"The Hunger Games\\" is now taking flak from fans of the film \\"Battle Royale\\" (2000) from Japan.  Yes it has a similar theme, but differs in other ways.  That's fine, but to think that \\"BR\\" is the one that came up with the idea is ridiculous.  Check out this list of films with similar themes:  \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" (1932), \\"Lord of the Flies\\" (1963) involves children too, \\"Death Race 2000\\" (1975), \\"Rollerball\\" (1975), the novella \\"The Long Walk\\" (1979) by Richard Bachman (Stephen King), \\"The Running Man\\" (1987).

1451627289|3.0|Well, when I sat down to write this, there were already almost 1,500 reviews.  After all, Stephen King is like the \\"Beatles\\" of horror fiction.  So there's no need for another detailed review.  Instead, I will relate this to my own experience with Stephen King.<br /><br />I was a Stephen King reader a long time ago, but he lost me with \\"The Stand\\", which I found overly long and boring, and seemed to me to fulfill a need for King to write something \\"epic\\".  Anyway, I didn't finish it and, although I picked up a King novel here and there when there was one laying around, I was not a dedicated fan.  I never bothered to read \\"It\\", which so many King fans consider his masterpiece.<br /><br />But I heard an interview with King on NPR (yeah, that's right:  NPR!) about this latest novel, and the plot was irresistible to me.  So I got my hands on it.<br /><br />And it reminded me of what I loved about King!  He really knows how to set out an amazing plot, and he knows how to put words together to keep you interested in the story.  It was at least a four-star novel!  Maybe five!<br /><br />And then I got a reminder of what I didn't like about King.  King was continuing to build layers of suspense when I was done wanting more things to feel suspenseful about.  I wanted some action in connection with the main plot:  stopping Lee Harvey Oswald from killing JFK.  I started to get, dare I say it, bored.  And I wondered if this novel really needed to be almost 850 pages.  And I'm not inclined to grab \\"It\\" right now after struggling through the last 150 pages of \\"11/22/63\\".<br /><br />One of my favorite horror/thriller novelists is Graham Masterton.  One of my ongoing criticisms of Masterton is that he does not pay enough attention to character development and rushes endings (and he is perhaps too graphic in regard to sex and violence for many readers; hence he is not the \\"Beatles\\"; I would sooner compare him to the \\"Kinks\\").  But Masterton is never boring; at least not so far for me.<br /><br />Somewhere between King and Masterton is the perfect horror/thriller novelist; it almost makes me think they should team up.  King would make sure proper attention would be paid to character and plot development; Masterton would ensure that the suspense ended and the action started when it was needed.<br /><br />Anyway, I recommend \\"11/22/63\\", but I caution that it does start to drag when it should have been picking up, and it gives very little insight into what the world really would have been like if JFK had not been assassinated, instead providing some sci-fi mumbo-jumbo.

0671510991|4.0|Kissinger presents you the most important moves, strategies, tactics and plans of this huge chess game called \\"diplomacy\\".<br /><br />This book will describe all the imbalances of the thin european political equilibrium during the last 5 centuries, and it is the best part of it, since when concerning USA he is not impartial (that's why I don't give it 5 stars).<br /><br />Through his \\"lens\\" we see more clearly why history developed the way we saw: the delayed german unification and the appearance of national socialism; the russian external policy and its position of strenght; the british opportunism and isolationism, the american chauvinism, etc.<br /><br />Very insightful reading!
B000NVT0RU|4.0|A piece of history I knew nothing about.  My thanks and gratitude go out to the colonials who fought on the side of the Allies during World War II; whether they were British colonials, Dutch colonials or in the case of this film INDIGENES (Days of Glory) Algerian/French colonials.  An excellent film with decent character development, great battle scenes with a bitter yet touching ending.  A film very much worth watching.

B0059XTUB8|4.0|This review is from: My Week with Marilyn (DVD)<br />Customer review from the Amazon Vine(tm) Program (What's this?)<br />Colin Clark who comes from a very prestigious and well to do family is<br />not happy when he decides he wants to do something different then what<br />his family approves of and go into the movie business.<br />After being a constant nuisance he is finally hired as the 3rd<br />assistant to the director and at 23 he is going to meet and spend time<br />with Marilyn Monroe. In his time with Marilyn we learn how at thirty<br />she is on her third marriage to play writer Arthur Miller and Marilyn's<br />first to London to film the movie The Prine and the Showgirl with Sir<br />Lawrence Olivia.<br />We are then introduced to the sad, beautiful ,insecure and baby like<br />(always needing someone around) that is what Marilyn is all about.<br />She has a full time body guard and he has started giving her pills to<br />go to sleep and she also takes booze. When necessary Colin is sent to<br />find out what is keeping her while the entire crew waits for her (she<br />is always late) never seems to get her lines right on the first or<br />second take and is causing the company huge losses in money cause of<br />her mood and actions.<br />We all remember Marilyn as the sexy blonde bombshell and although I<br />must say Michelle Williams is absolutely wonderful in this movie I did<br />not feel she looked like what Marilyn looked like or was portrayed in<br />magazines and books she looks to shorter and is not as well endowed as<br />the real Marilyn but her acting is the reason she was a nominee as a<br />best actress.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved this Book, I haven't written any reviews on books, and I read a lot.<br />  This book grabbed me from the 1st page,  and didn't let go..... The ending is very surpising.  I read this book in one day because I could not put it down. I was up until 5 am reading it. Gulity or not guilty,that's the question,and a fathers Love with a hidden secret past that come to light.<br />  The courage of the Father and strong belief cost him everything. A good D.A. torn through the worst nightmare a father could endure,and he still stood by his son and looked for the truth. Always wanted a fair trial, guilty or not.<br />  You will not be dissapointed if you read this book. It was written very well ,not boring  at all and kept me on the edge of my seat.I could not sleep.<br />  Buy this book and read it. My sympathy for the boys family who was killed. Also for Patz.  Loved the Book though--Loved loved loved it! READ it.

B0062GM6FS|1.0|I chose one star because I did not have the option to rate it higher than the five available, and this deserved a Giant gold star, Also, folks generally tend to read the one star reviews first. I've been a fan for years, and after the first read my basic notions were disabused. I read an interview in Esquire a few years earlier, and saw that  KR was a regular sort of dude, talented, but he wasn't some pretentious prig. The media makes him out as less than the sum of all he's-along with the rest of the band-generated for this world over the years, and that Mr. Richard's was less than one of the greats. Keith Richards plays down the fact that he's done more for rock music than the whole lot of artists who've followed the trail he invented. For example, that whole five string sound-striking stuff. His use of an acoustic guitar on cuts that for decades I thought were electric. How he<br />synchronized the music...I don't want to give too much away. Bottom line is, that for the work, devotion,dedication, and all the people he's helped along the way I think he' been shortchanged ...Read this book, and be mindful that the author's one hell of a decent guy, a loyal friend, and someone up there is lookin' out for him.
B004HZ76FQ|5.0|My boyfriend and my niece can not get enough of this game. They look forward to weekends so they can stay up late to play!!
B007HJ9NBE|2.0|This movie is completely direvative of the 1984 movie.  I understand it is intended for the youth of today, however, aside from some variation in music, most songs from the 1984 movie turned into country-western sound, the script sticks very close to the original.  It seems to me that dusting off the older movie is a much more enticing movie for viewers of all ages.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Wow i cant believe the twist the author put on this. I cant wait for the next one. All that time thinking alex was dead,i can only hope he forgives her! What a way to end the book, leaves me wanting more! I dont konw how Im goning to be able to wiat for the next one in 2013!
B0075PYG1M|5.0|This is a beautiful album, no question.  I love it!  But, it has been mis-categorized as jazz.  It is not jazz.  Why can't a great jazz musician like Robert Glasper cross over and get paid every so often?  Herbie Hancock did it, as did Miles, and many other great ones.  There are a few cuts where he hints at his prowess as a great jazz improvisor, but that still doesn't make this album jazz.  You could even go so far as to say that he teaches a little bit about jazz to a more mainstream audience with cuts like the jazzy rendition of Afro Blue with my girl Erykah Badu on the mic.  Maybe some will listen to this lovely work of art and use it as a stepping stone to real jazz.  This is a beautiful album, something to chill out to and I hope Robert makes enough on it to return to the unrewarding career of a jazz musician.  Kudos to you, Robert, but don't forget to come home.
B002QNGKGW|2.0|Trinity makes for a sicko, which is great and adds suspense. Deb is charismatic and excellent. Dexter is Dexter, and Michael Hall continues his supreme excellence.<br /><br />My trouble sits with two issues. For one, not nearly enough bad-guy killing, and it's not even so Dexter can find himself this time.<br /><br />The main issue I have is with the whole Rita fighting with Dexter. It feels like the producers are trying to force their marriage to fall apart. The arguments are weak, the conflict feels forced, and it's just stupid.<br /><br />Honestly, I stopped watching it after four episodes because the acting on Julie Benz's was not convincing at all.<br /><br />Also, the Batista x LaGuerta thing is annoying, but the former does a decent job with making it feel important.<br /><br />All in all, the romance sucks and lacks emotion, and there's not even any action to make up for it. Just... lots and lots and lots of crappy romance.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|The villain is truly despicable, and the heroine digs herself into a frightening hole on a remote island.  The climax has nail-biting moments, and the book makes great reading on a lonely, stormy day.

0142407380|3.0|Ark Angel starts good but the action doesn't continue and the plot's not as good either. It starts with Alex in the hospital after he's been shot. There he meets another boy and saves him from a terrorist group. The terrorist group is run by the boy's father and the attack was a diversion though. MI6 sends Alex into space to a space station to try to stop the real attack. It's nowhere near as good as the ones before it but still fun.
B003EYVXVE|5.0|Hunger Games... One of the best book to film transitions I have seen. The director/writters/production team really \\"got\\" that book. The acting was good, spot on costumes, great sets and the music was just right. They did not try and use modern fluff tunes. The music was unique and fit the mood/scenes perfectly. Overall they did a good job of condensing that book.
B006VREN86|5.0|I am a huge Steve Buscemi fan and to be honest when Boardwalk Empire came out I hesitated to see it because my impression of Buscemi was really formed around Resevoir Dogs and Fargo where he is portrayed almsot always as a crazy, go-lucky, weirdo, maniac type guy.  Boardwalk Empire really blew me away with how Buscemi has changed and has fit into a totally different character.  In this first season of the series, Buscemi plays \\"Nuci\\" Thompson who is the Treasurer of Atlantic City in name but really runs everything including booze and girls.  You see so many different sides of Thompson in this first season as there are days where he is caring and giving to widows and those in need of help and others times where he will shoot someone without thinkign twice.  The season gives you a great look into early 1900s Atlantic City and the corruption both there and in other big cities like New York and Chicago. HBO does a great job portraying the lives of real characters of the time including Al Capone and others. Overall a really good series that is a must-see and in particular for Buscemi fans.

Very grim, very brutal, but an ending with some hope...
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I made the same mistake with Patrick Rothfuss and The Wise Man's Fear that I made with The Name of the Wind. I peeked at the first paragraph! I couldn't help it.<br /><br />While removing books I've read from my Kindle, I saw The Wise Man's Fear pop up. I skipped over it with the cursor. I would come back to it after I finished the two books currently in my queue... Nope. I had to peek. Three chapters later, I knew I couldn't stop.<br /><br />The main character, Kvothe, is again at the inn telling his story to the Chronicler. We're immediately taken back to his time at the University. This made me nervous at first because the majority of the first book took place there as well. I wondered whether Rothfuss could squeeze in enough of the stories we'd been promised. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Rothfuss takes us on a trip away from the university and the reader learns more about the legend that is Kvothe. The excitement picks up right where book one left off and we're introduced to a completely new cast of lively characters.<br /><br />The pacing is tremendous. Night after night, I stayed up longer than the half hour I allow myself to read before bed. Book two has a more fantastical feel than the first and I couldn't get enough.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the characters in book one, Rothfuss picks it up in that respect. More than one of these characters put Kvothe in his place, yet he lives up to his name and finds ways to get what he wants. Without giving away too much, let's just say the Adem mercenary Kvothe meets up with is one of my favorite characters.<br /><br />The ending blew me away. It's one of those situations where you wish you could kick the author in the shin because they leave you wanting more! These scenes at the inn really bring the story together. Rothfuss reveals a little more about The Chronicler and Bast, and the role they'll play in Kvothe's future.<br /><br />Five Stars was an easy choice.

0061353248|5.0|This book does a magnificent job introducing me, as a layperson, to the idea that simple traditional economics doesn't serve well to actually predict behavior, and that, rather, many of our behaviors can't be explained by rational ideas of benefit and causality.  It is smart, tremendously well-informed and cited, and heavy with both academic support and pop-culture connection.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is an excellent little sharpner and if you pull your knife through it correctly you'll sharpen it well. If not, you would damage your blade. So read instructions creafully and practice.
B007BLCGNU|1.0|I'm rarely sorry that I watched a Clint Eastwood film, so this was a rare exception. And, if it hadn't had his name listed as director, I never EVER would have guessed. I guess we are all entitled to a bad day every once in a while, but this movie was ridiculously bad, and since I can't blame the actors, I have to blame Clint. It was truly like pulling hen's teeth to follow the narrative between the FBI story and the possibly homosexual lifestyle, both of which were uninteresting. I truly am sorry to have to give it such a bad review, but it just sucked as bad as any film I've ever seen.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Works great on my kindle fire!!!! I love how it tells you where the bird is going!!! I already beat the game but I can't stop playing it!!! GET IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!

B002S0OBMS|5.0|Ramin Karimloo has one of the most amazing voices I have heard in years. I can so identify with Christine's desire to be with the Phantom. If I had the ability to hear Ramin sing to me the way he does, I'd want to live forever.<br /><br />Sierra Boggess is also very amazing. Normally I do not like soprano voices because they are too high. At only one time is Sierra's range so high that I cannot really understand her words. Yet, it is only one small time in a long and beautiful story. After watching bits and pieces of LND's Australian cast and realizing the movie was not made with Ramin and Sierra I was disappointed. I will not be ordering the DVD because I have already become very loyal to Ramin and Sierra. Just as loyal as Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman's fans are.<br /><br />Too many years have passed to have Michael and Sarah reprise their roles. I personally cannot stand watching Sarah sing, yet listening to her is fine.<br /><br />I say give Ramin and Sierra the chance they have earned. Michael and Sarah will always be the first. Ramin and Sierra have made a wonderful new addition to these roles and have allowed younger Phans the chance to discover the beauty of Andrew Lloyd Webber's compositions.<br /><br />Break a leg Ramin and Sierra. May you have as much success with your future endeavors as you have had with Phantom and LND.

0765350386|5.0|I finished the whole trilogy and I recommend it for someone looking for a light read. The pace is fast and the world Brandon Sanderson built is very interesting. Never heard of allomancy before and its a great take on \\"magic\\". I don't think I like the sequels as much as the first book but the ending was very satisfying.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this game is great because it has 101 games in one app. The games are very fun because they are entertaining.

B007G5K066|5.0|Okay, let's go ahead and get the trite yet obligatory comparisons out of the way first so we can put them behind us and move on.  Let it be stipulated from the outset that this movie is not as good as the John le Carr&eacute; novel it is based on, or the 1979 BBC television miniseries starring Alec Guinness and Ian Richardson.  Having said that, let's get real for a moment:  No movie is ever as good as the book it is based on; and there's simply no way to pack as much storytelling into a two hour movie as can be packed into a six hour miniseries.  So, these sorts of comparisons are really unfair, and are not very helpful.  A movie should be judged on its own merits -- i.e. whether or not it is worth watching -- not by how closely it follows its source material or other retellings of the same story.  The only situation that would justify criticizing a movie for not living up to the book it was based on would be one in which the movie radically changes the plot of the story, or else completely misses the point that the original author was trying to make.  As long as a movie tries to be faithful to the novelist's vision, then the screenwriters and director shouldn't be criticized simply for making the sorts of alterations and abridgements that are always necessary when adapting a book for the silver screen.  John le Carr&eacute; writes very complex stories; and no movie can ever hope to fully capture the layered intricacy of his writing.  Yet, in spite of this, some truly excellent films have been made based on his novels, the most brilliant being \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" starring Richard Burton, which is arguably the best spy movie ever made.  Even that movie is not as good as le Carr&eacute;'s novel; but it is a cinematic masterpiece, nonetheless.  So, let's ignore all those critics who have nothing more original to say than, \\"It's not as good as the book,\\" or, \\"The TV version was better,\\" and review this movie on its own merits.<br /><br />So, when judgedon its own merits, is this a good movie?  Is it worth watching?  Would I recommend it to others?  Absolutely yes!  This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  It is wonderfully written and brilliantly acted.  And the director takes some creative risks that, at least in my opinion, really pay off in terms of setting the right mood.  Rather than trying to turn this into a fast-paced thriller, he lets the story unfold gradually, as it does in the novel.  Rather than explicitly spelling everything out in detail, he trusts the audience to be able to follow the plot, read between the lines, and figure out what's going on without having to be spoon fed information.  Rather than relying on dialogue to give us a sense of who the characters are, he makes creative use of silence -- often long stretches of uncomfortable silence -- that forces us to look beyond the words people say, which are often used to conceal the truth, and focus instead on the non-verbal cues that people give off, which paint a more honest portrait of who they are and what's going on inside their heads.  These creative choices might alienate some audiences; but I think that most John le Carr&eacute; fans will appreciate them as much as I do.<br /><br />As for the plot, the movie is really just a very condensed version of the book.  There are a few, relatively minor changes here and there, most of which are necessary simply in order to fit this expansive story into a two-hour film.  But you'd have to be the world's biggest nitpicker to fault this movie for these trivial alterations.  It certainly remains true to the story the author was trying to tell; and it definitely has the \\"feel\\" of a John le Carr&eacute; novel.  If you've read the book, and/or have seen the miniseries, I think you'll be happy with how faithful this movie is to the original story.  And if you haven't already read the book or seen the miniseries, watching this movie may actually inspire you to do so.<br /><br />The casting of this movie is absolutely amazing.  Gary Oldman gives a totally convincing portrayal of George Smiley, the quiet, world-weary spymaster called out of retirement to find a Soviet mole at the highest levels of British intelligence.  I still can't help but picture Alec Guinness whenever I think of Smiley; but Oldman's performance is just about as close to flawless as one could hope for.  If the filmmakers decide to make a sequel or two (it would be wonderful if they could do the entire Karla trilogy), and Oldman reprises his role, then I just might start picturing him instead of Guinness whenever I re-read one of le Carr&eacute;'s Smiley stories.  Oldman's supporting cast is also superb.  Benedict Cumberbatch (of \\"Sherlock\\" fame) turns in a stellar performance as Peter Guillam, Smiley's right-hand man (who seems to get more screen time than any other character, except perhaps Smiley himself).  Colin Firth (best known of late for \\"The King's Speech\\") doesn't really get all that much screen time as Smiley's old friend, colleague, and romantic rival Bill Haydon; but he sells the part quite nicely.  And the incomparable John Hurt gives what has to be seen as the definitive portrayal of Control, Smiley's old boss, the former head of British intelligence, who was forced into retirement when his obsession with uncovering a traitor within his inner circle led to disaster.<br /><br />For those who are not familiar with this story, it's set in the early 1970s, at a time when the Cold War had begun to settle down into a shadowy game of chess played between spies and counterspies.  The old men who played this game had long since let go of any illusions that what they were doing was noble or patriotic.  It was simply necessary.  And, since the pieces on the chessboard were human beings, many of whom would have to be sacrificed in the course of the long game, the players had to develop a callous pragmatism and a cold detachment from the people around them.  In this world, secrecy was essential, suspicion was rampant, and trust was a luxury that often came at too high a price.  These soulless spymasters led miserable lives, with little consolation apart from the occasional moment of fleeting advantage gained over their opponents in the long game.  This is the setting for John le Carr&eacute;'s intriguing tale about the hunt for a \\"mole\\" (i.e. a traitor spying on behalf of the Soviets) inside the topmost levels of the Circus (i.e. the British Secret Intelligence Service, MI6).  I don't want to spoil the plot; so I won't say any more.  But if you enjoy realistic spy stories (as opposed to the larger-than-life James Bond or Jason Bourne stuff), I think you'll really enjoy this movie.<br /><br />As for the DVD/Blu-ray release, the special features are a little thin; but, let's be honest, you're getting this for the movie, not for the bonus material on the disc.  The movie is definitely worth having on DVD or Blu-ray, especially if you're a big John le Carr&eacute; fan like I am.  I've always regarded \\"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\\" as le Carr&eacute;'s best Cold War spy novel (even better, in my opinion, than \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\").  So, I love this story and the characters in it; and I think this movie handles the story and the characters admirably.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would highly recommend it.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|App is wonderful and extremely fun. The price is rediculous, I can get it for $ .99 on my phone from the Android market.
B000JMKNJ2|1.0|The story is very interesting but the way it is written really put me off. The constant flashbacks is annoying because it unnecessarily intrudes on the story telling. All the characters aren't very interesting either. After reading Death of a Necromancer (similar book about a genius thief in a world full of rich, corrupt nobles), this book pales in comparison. I don't recommend it to others.
B001F0VHEM|4.0|The disc came as brand new or it looks that way, the jewel case is cracked upon arrival :( but that's ok it's replaceable but arrived very quickly and as I said the disc appears to be brand new in brand new packaging, very happy.
B006J420UE|5.0|I like this \\"APU\\" because it didn't cost too much and it's great for my home theater type PC (silverstone GDO5 case).  It is a pretty fast processor giving me a windows experience index WEI score of 7.3 on the CPU and 6.7 on the graphics (which is done by the APU, no PCI-E card installed).  I also own the A6-3500 APU and it's great too.  This A8-3870k does run quite a bit hotter than my A6-3500 which is a 65 watt processor.  I Just mention that because in a smaller case for HTPC the A6-3500 would be a better choice, that little APU is probably the best value I've seen in a long time (I have a \\"review\\" of that also).<br /><br />Why did I get this APU? Well it's \\"unlocked\\" and was only ten bucks more than the A8-3850, that made it an easy decision for me.  I've been building/overclocking pc's for years and I just like the flexibility.  My ASUS FM1a75-M Pro does not respond well to overclocking the front side bus, so having an unlocked multiplier is nice.  I have not tested the overclocking potential yet because I'm using the stock cooler and my case doesn't have room for anything other than the Scythe Big Shuriken low profile cooler.<br /><br />Why do you want this processor? If it's to do some hardcore gaming your barking up the wrong tree.  If it's to be a budget friendly jack of all trades computer with good performance then this is the cats meow.  I use this as a home theater pc, casual gaming, and office work.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I added the ASUS HD 6670 1GB card that's here on Amazon.  For those that are interested in Crossfire with the APU (a main selling point) the 3dmark11 score is about 2500 and the 3dmark Vantage score is about 9350.  How good does that stack up to the competition? I don't really know but I can play \\"The Witcher 2\\" on medium settings at 1440x900 resolution, less than ideal for a gaming machine IMO but it works for me.  From what I've been reading the witcher 2 is one of the most graphically intensive games out now, and I can playit at decent settings.  Again this is not supposed to be a competitive gaming machine but a jack of all trades setup with bang for your buck and I'm happy.  Philosopy of use friends ala Nutnfancy.
B002KKBV8I|5.0|You can build a huge amount of really cool polygons with these.  For the super nerds in the crowd, you can build all of the Dungeons and Dragons dice other than the D10 with these.  Good strong magnets; one piece can pick up almost the entire set.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Games are fun but short. Lots of fun options for all including my 5 year old. We all have our favorites.
B007BLDFWG|1.0|All the characters are annoying, I didn't really care what happen in the end. It is tough to watch a movie where I can not stand anyone in the film. At least it was an original plot, but I just could not stand the main character and most of the supporting cast, acting was good just a bad plot.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|- but this was even better. fincher outdoes himself. reznor & finch's soundtrack is amazing. daniel craig & renee russo are great - and mara's performance as lisbeth leaves this fan of the trilogy in anticipation of a coming hornet's nest!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is so much fun! I would so totally recommend this to friends. It is a good down load.
B005K17RU0|3.0|good info but sometimes takes a sec to reconfigure. I like it and would probly download again. good for a free app.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read this omnibus in three days.  The story drew me in from the start, at one point my husband told me to put it down and go to sleep!  I loved the style of writing and even the cliffhangers.  I am eagerly looking forward to the 6th book.  I think this would make a great movie or a t.v. miniseries.  Thanks for a great read!

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I got this book not really knowing what it was. My friend who is a school teacher said it was so good. We have the same taste . So i purchased the first book and could NOT put it down. I ended up getting this set and getting a refund for the book alone. I haven't read something this good in a long time. I was so into it.  When they ate, i ate, when they were thirsty I was thirsty. I just loved this book. I had to know that they'd be alright so I was up late hours of the night and working on 2 hours of sleep each day until I was done.  I started on Saturday last week and finished on Tuesday night. Ha ha!! This book is a little graphic due to the nature of the story, but there is a lot do discuss about  what  things  we deem as entertainment  these days and if we keep watching crap on tv, this is where we could be headed.  Excellent book!
B000002UB3|5.0|\\"Abbey Road\\" is one of my favorite Beatles albums. It is definitely my favorite in terms of audio quality and production.
B004J1DBJI|4.0|I picked this one up for fun. It does provide some interesting information if you search for the right thing. I would often find that what I was looking for was not available, or I could not figure out how to find it. For example, I wanted to see if I could get some common Fraunhofer diffraction patterns for known apertures (rectangle, circle). I could not get it to return them. I couldn't even get the Fourier transform of a 1-D rectangle function. There were other instances where I was looking for something, and it could not find it.<br /><br />I think that the concept is a good one, and the cloud computation direction is the way that things are going. I just don't think this is there yet. Like they have filled in some of what they need, but it is a work in progress.<br /><br />It may be that it is possible to do what I wanted, and I just could not figure out how to implement it. In which case some interface improvement may be the way to go.<br /><br />-Lee
B005ILYWN2|5.0|I think Cloverfield is almost unwatchable as the camerawork is way too shaky.  Same with the movie Quarantine.  Some filmmakers forget that the viewer needs to be able to understand what's happening onscreen.  Troll Hunter is done perfectly.  It is a mockumentary but done very well and the execution is superb.  All the actors are great and so many original ideas in the film.  Very fun movie and worth watching.  Keeps you entertained from beginning to end.
B0073PQ720|1.0|Lots of time spent in silence, people staring at each other.  Not what was expected from a show called 'Drive'.
B007MNV5WU|2.0|this game looks really cool, but I wouldn't know because there is no free version. 2.99 that is insane!! grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. &gt;:(
B00006FM77|2.0|I don't expect perfection from live recordings but I was surprised how bad the audio quality is; bass doesn't exist, horns sound tinny; AND THIS IS A REMASTERED SET! I wonder how bad it was before remastering?
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a tough one to review without giving spoilers as for me the mystery and reveal of the world was one of the best experiences of this novel and I'd encourage you to read the book or the sample before going through the pages of reviews here, many of which have some pretty significant spoilers.<br /><br />The first two (probably my favorite) have a slow reveal of this post-apocalyptic world. You start as blind as (most) everyone in the story but with some VERY puzzling circumstances that begin to unfold.  Books 3-5 begin to reveal what's behind the curtain, but it happens organically and at a pace that you stay engaged, you still have questions, and just can't put the book down because besides learning more about the world there is a whole plot unfolding that keeps you continuously engaged.  That said the last couple books of the omnibus read more like an action adventure wholly dependent on the other parts for context, but the first couple volumes really held their own as classic scifi stories.<br /><br />I'd be interested in seeing the story jump and continue within the world in time or place.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|this game is awesome. the gravity makes it even better. when you are at the first level 1 it is still awesome.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I have to admit I was a little angry that it was free with aneroid and 3buckz. here. All I have is a kindle fire so I cant be that mad. anyway it is a really fun game and you really need to try it. WE NEED YOU!
B005H29GSI|4.0|My son received the Angry Birds Knock on Wood game for a gift and absolutely loved it!  He has been to 5 birthday parties recently and has given each of the boys the AB: Ice game.  All 5 loved the game.  My son said he likes the Wood game a bit better because it comes with more birds.  Both games provide a lot of entertainment for boys of any age.<br /><br />Teachers of middle- high school age kids could easily incorporate this game into their physics and geometry lesson plans.

B007704HO6|5.0|I saw a video of Bob and James on the corriere website a few days before the book was published and I have been impatiently waiting for it  since then.

To them my best wishes and best luck with the book.<br />By the way my friends would like to read it but there is not yet out an Italian version, when will be available in italian?
1439102732|4.0|I think, as a reader, I have a right to choose what topics I am willing to spend my time on. The back cover of the book does not disclose that the book is about a gay rights and a custody battle. I probably would have passed on this book had I known. Having said that, after recovering from the emotional slam of Zoe being served papers I decided to stick with it, being sure to read at a more guarded emotional level. Picoult has a beautifully simple and frank writing style that makes her characters easy to relate to. She was able to present all sides of very emotional topics with grace and honesty. I love Picoult's writing style, but I will be more diligent with my research before purchasing an other title.
B003E6K1VK|2.0|bought the FIIO E7 back in July 2011 and it worked well until it died today. This unit lasted only a few months, wasted my money. I am no longer buying FIIO and will look for something else to power up my Sennheiser HD650.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|First, notice that this product has received over 200 reviews, with an average of 4.5 stars. Second, notice that (as of March 2012) it is temporarily out of stock. Those two facts should tell you it has pleased most of the people who bought it.<br /><br />I am one of the hundreds of happy customers. I've been using this cover for about eight weeks. It looks as good, maybe better, than the picture. It fits just fine. It is a tight fit because it has to be; otherwise the device might slip out and break. It did take a little tussling to get the Fire into the elastic holders, but once it was in place, no problems. There was a mild odor when I first opened it; this is not uncommon. After a few days out of the packaging it was gone, and in the meantime I kept it in a ventilated area, and not right next to my bed. The cover did not lay completely flat at first, so when I was not using it I laid it face-down. In a few days this was no longer necessary. The cover is flexible enough to bend backward, out of the way, when necessary (such as when using the device in landscape mode).<br /><br />I keep a cute little red stylus clipped inside the spine so I always have it available; that is a \\"must-have,\\" as far as I'm concerned, for highlighting text and using the keyboard. The stylus fits nicely there and does not scratch anything.<br /><br />If I could add anything to the product it might be an elastic band to keep it closed when it's in my backpack, but so far this hasn't really been a problem, and I think that it might detract from the cover's appearance. And I can always make one.<br /><br />I like this cover particularly, but I think ALL Kindle Fire devices should have some kind of cover. Sooner or later you will drop it, and having a sturdy cover will make a big difference in whether it sustains serious damage.
B006JTS5OO|3.0|I loved the movie, was looking forward to getting the soundtrack - reason I bought this version of DVD release. But I will not and do not want a Disney Movie Rewards account and find it VERY POOR marketing to force one to have an account to get the soundtrack that one has paid for - very cheesey. And that this is not clearly stated before purchase is cheesey X2.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|As with all Jack Reacher novels, I find them fast flowing and never dull in areas. Lee Child has created an icon in Jack<br />Reacher and I am sure all readers will want to read all the Reacher novels. Well done!!!!!
145162445X|4.0|A concise and well written explanation of several of the major features of contemporary cosmology.  Krauss discusses the origins, evolution, and ultimate fate of the universe, at least as we understand it presently.  Krauss is careful to specify major, and there are some enormous, gaps in our present knowledge.  He argues well, however, that what we do know is quite substantial.  A particular emphasis is the idea that is thought of as empty space actually contains considerable energy due to basic features of quantum mechanics.  In conjunction with the idea that \\"inflation\\" governed the early universe, this leads to concepts of spontaneous generations of universes in a \\"multiverse\\" of an infinite set of universes.  Much of this thinking is speculative though based solidly in the rather impressive theories and discoveries of modern physics.<br /><br />Krauss' discussions of nothing are probably not going to satisfy (see some of the other Amazon reviewer comments) philosophically or theologically oriented readers who find his definition of nothing unsatisfactory.  Krauss responds that this (common) criticism is something of a moving target and that negative definitions are something of an evasion. Regardless of your philosophical or theological orientation, Krauss is presenting a very plausible naturalistic scenario for the origin and fate of the universe.  Its worth remembering also that cosmology is a relatively young science, dating only from Einstein's publication of General Relativity approximately a century ago.  Its very likely that next century will bring further great developments and there is a good chance they will vindicate some of the ideas Krauss discusses.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Bad story. Clearly  no money was spent doing research for this book, I know at least as far as location, language, weather...its all wrong. I can only surmise the real meat of the book was equally researched by way of wikipedia. I think high schoolers could write better.

1451627289|4.0|Did I get your attention Steven? I thought that would. First of all great book: I devoured it in 4 days while I was out on the road. I'm 43 and have been reading you since high school in the 80's.<br />I think you decided to take the realist route at the end of the book and shied away from the romantic reality of the situation: a man haplessly in love will act regardless of the circumstances. If I were Jake I might have done everything  up to the part where I danced with an 80 year old Sadie and then having realized that she never tasted true love and saw what happened without me, it would have been 'f' it and right back down the rabbit hole 'Whhooosh....Whooosh'.....\\"Jimbla what are you doing back here?!? Jimbla, no!!\\" I would meet her again and live my life with her and if things got warped in the new reality, we both would go back through the hole together and back again to reset it. Together. I understand its authors prerogative but again, if I were Annie and taking care of you, that last chapter or two would be rewritten. True love trumps everything. So, what, after George (Jake) gets done dancing with the 80 year old Sadie he goes home pets his cat, makes a TV dinner and stares at the wall?<br />I'd realistically say that 8 out of 10 guys would be going back through that portal again. Because they figure they are dead without her anyway..what would they care if even the world blew up?

Then your a genius for figuring out what milk will help them stay alive?  You enjoy them when they are cubs and then when they get to large you ship them of to a zoo for profit..  Two LOSERS!
B007JRU2UK|2.0|The acting and storyline were poor.  The scenery, however, was fantastic!  I spent most of the movie identifying the filming locations.
B001S37BJ6|5.0|This is my seven year old's favourite book. It is not a good read aloud, but perfect for a good reader to curl up with. Dahl's adult characters are mainly the usual grotesques and Matilda is a joy to read.<br /><br />I love the way Dahl never compromises. He writes tension. And scary scenes. Plot is always well paced. Vocabulary is challenging enough. My daughter keeps a notebook for jotting down unknown vocabulary - albeit pronunciation or meaning!  Realistically, this would be unsuitable for under sevens - as the unknown vocab would be way too much!<br /><br />Now a classic - but do yourself a favour -  do not use it as a read aloud at a young age. It should be savored as a juicy morsel when reading to oneself.<br /><br />Suitability 7- 12 years.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|love this game so much I have it on my I pod my I phone yep love ot they made t shirts for it cause its so popular!!!:)
B007MNV5WU|5.0|only two worlds but there's gonna be more! the first angry birds didn't lie about coming soon. this game is sweet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;
B006MQRLSA|4.0|Entertaining movie about baseball, a game that is a big business.  That I liked it is amazing since I really don't like baseball.
B007N5YIUS|2.0|Found out after that wifi required to download.  Can't get wifi.  Stuck with it in top bar.  Wifi not needed with google.
B000EDWKXI|5.0|I bought this DVD used. When I got it, it was packed like new. I was really impressed with the quality. It works like new! The shipping was really quick too. I got the movie about 2 days after I ordered it.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|When I first got it had the force close error. Now after update it just freezes after about 5 mins. Looks fun, but hard to enjoy with all the glitches. Samsung Fascinate on Verizon.
B0034G4P4O|4.0|A cute movie with great animation.  Laughed out loud quite a few times.  However, my dog slept right through it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I've heard about this book for years now, but was never really interested in reading it. At the time, I was reading only urban fantasy or paranormal romance novels and didn't know what to make of the dystopian genre. After seeing the movie trailer for The Hunger Games, I was intrigued. I went out and bought the entire series. I am so glad that I read this book, it was way better than I anticipated. The characters and the world-building were exceptionally believable.  Katniss, and all the other characters in the novel were well developed, and as a reader I felt connected to the characters. Whatever was happening to them in the book, as a reader I also felt their joy, sadness, and pain.<br /><br />The pacing of the book was great; it had me constantly turning the pages eager to find out what will happen next.  I finished the book in 2 days, would have been sooner if I didn't have school LOL. The book is told from Katniss's point of view; and the majority of the book is full description rather than the usual dialogue that I read. The ending of the book had a lot of surprises that I wasn't expecting (example: what happened to the dead tributes). Overall, I really enjoyed this book and I would recommend it to anyone whose looking for an action-pack novel. This is my first dystopian book, and surely it will not be my last. I look forward to reading more of Katniss's adventure in the next two books in trilogy. Like everyone this weekend, I will be watching The Hunger Games movie as well!
B005LAIH2W|5.0|John Carter captures the spirit of the original ERB books very well.  I'm not going to give a thorough review of the movie because so many other reviewers have already done that.  I will, however, say that everyone involved in the production of this movie should be commended.  The film takes Burroughs' \\"A Princess of Mars\\" and combines elements of the second book \\"Gods of Mars\\" (adding a few tweaks along the way) to create what can be called a mini-masterpiece.  The story is well-written, the characters are fleshed out, the FX enhance the story not overshadow it, and the acting is excellent.  The stunning Lynn Collins steals the show with her performance as Princess Dejah Thoris, Taylor Kitsch is admirable as Carter, and Willem Dafoe is perfect as the Thark leader Tars Tarkas. Andrew Stanton did a great job directing, the score is memorable, and the visuals are breathtaking.<br /><br />If you haven't read the original books (which are absolute classics), you'll enjoy this movie because it's a great movie.  If you're already a fan of the books, you'll love the movie despite some of the changes (John Carter was never married before he went to Mars, for one), which can be overlooked (If you want an almost accurate representation of the source material, Dynamite Entertainment's \\"Warlord or Mars\\" comic series [along with the excellent spin-offs] is highly recommended.  In fact, it's probably the best comic book out there right now).  I'm already a huge John Carter fan, and this movie is a wonderful addition to the world of John Carter.<br /><br />Do not let the critics stop you from seeing this movie.  Anyone who gave this movie a bad review is an idiot and was probably on something when they saw this movie, or they based their reviews solely on the awful trailers.  The marketing campaign for this movie is one of the worst I've ever seen, and there has been little or no merchandising for this movie-it's almost like Disney wanted this movie to fail.  There are some fan trailers on the internet that absolutely blow away what Disney put out, and they really make you want to see the movie.  I've given up hope that we'll see the sequels, but maybe people will listen to everyone that has actually seen the movie without an agenda, and the final box office and DVD/Blu-ray sales can keep the franchise going.<br /><br />In closing, I cannot wait til John Carter comes out on DVD, and I give my highest recommendation to this film.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|I like the concept, but the levels never really got very difficult. Some of the end levels were just as easy as the beginning ones.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Bought for my 4 year old, she loves it!  Keeps her occupied when at the the market, in the car for long rides, or just when I need a few minutes to get ready.  Where's my water is another great app for her age also.
B005ZUR724|1.0|PROs:<br />3D MMORPG, WoW-like, HD, and best of all, its MOBILE!!!<br /><br />CONs:<br />*In-App purchase is buggy and it sometimes TAKES YOU MONEY but not give you what you purchased.<br />*the DeSync is so bad,the other player that is standing on your toe is \\"Out of Range\\"<br />*Server Lags really bad during peak hours. its unplayable.<br />*Customer Service is as bad as the lag in game. they dont actually help you. they will just send you an email that you issue has been forwarded to the right department...but nothing is done to your issue.
B007B6VOG0|1.0|Musical artists have the right to use whatever kind of language they want. As a customer, I would appreciate knowing that an album has explicit language before I purchase it. This album makes liberal use of the F-word but does not have an explicit warning. Wish I had known before purchasing it.
B0060FXDCG|5.0|Bought this for the wife, she loves the transformer movies. I wanted her to have them all and she loves that she has all three. Item is exactly as described.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Love trying to figure out the clues &amp; getting to the next step and clue revealed..uses the thinking process and putting pieces of puzzle together..great fun..kept me busy &amp; going back frequently when I took breaks..addicting!!
B0067DBB4S|2.0|It was a solid Album, but nothing was new and it all sounded the same to me. Same tempos, same reflections in his voice, same sounding choruses, ect. It was a boring Album. I listened to it all the way through 5 times on a long drive and I couldn't have cared less about it. His first 2 were by far, superior to this rubbish. I know everyone can't be a winner, but this one felt like He just called in sick.
B003SI605K|5.0|This film is a delight to watch. It is extremely artistic. I do understand what one of the reviewers meant when she said that the book and the film reinforce every stereotype about China and Chinese people. The problem is that stereotypes sell. Writers and film makers find it all too easy to reinforce stereotypes because of this. That aside, there are many positive aspects to the film.<br /><br />I found the acting was excellent and true to life. The movement between the past and the present was extremely well done. At the end, I had to wipe the tears from my eyes.
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|Agree the Ice Cream Sandwich update to my Htc Vivid the game is broken. When you loose the game it resets back to the beginning as if you never played. Too bad, it's been fun, I hope they fix this soon.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|enjoyable game, but the review is annoying. word word words word word word word word word word word word word.
B004CAWSKE|5.0|Really enjoyed it! Her singing is spot on and the group as a whole is really coming together. I am eagerly awaiting the third album! I really enjoy it as driving music or background stuff as I wrench in the garage :) I would like to see a little heavier some stuff from them though.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like it!! I wish that they would make it without wifi needed. They should put questions in it so. that we could think about what. we mist read
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a great app also it kills time so when your bored pick it up and ignore the ads.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book was worth the purchase.  It was well written and kept me wanting to read more.  I strongly recommend this to Amazon's customers.
B0044MIIA4|5.0|Amazing Album! There are a few songs that I listen almost everyday! She has such an amazing voice. The only negative I found was just a pet peeve of mine. I really hate it when you can hear every single breath the singer takes and if a few of the songs she takes super huge breathes and they are just as loud as the song she is singing. Very very distracting. I don't know if it was a mixing error or if she actually just has a soft voice and they are having to amp it to match the music or what but it's really loud sometimes. Other than that and like I said it was just a pet peeve, I loved it!.
0525478817|5.0|The book makes you feel all of the things. Really, that's all you need to know about it. Go read it and don't forget to be awesome.
B006KX3GXO|3.0|everytime i try to put on a effect on my picture with the &quot;brush&quot; my picture goes black!!!!!!<br />FIX NOW!!!!
0439023513|1.0|SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />I read all the books within a week and before the movie came out.  I have to say, I was very very excited with the first two books, looking forward to the third, but I wish I never read it.<br /><br />The third book ruined the series.  Foremost, it's boring.  It's mostly made up about how damaged Katness and her fellow victor's are due to the Capitol. It also follows district 13 is as oppressive as the Capitol. Blah Blah Blah, government is evil, blah blah blah, more violence blah blah blah, lets try to kill president snow, blah blah blah, oops, Prim dies, blah blah blah, Gale runs off and in 1 sentence, Katness decides Peeta is who she loves.<br /><br />Everything you read this book for was summed up within the last 2 paragraphs.. It was horrible.. horrible ending to a great series.  It seriously made the series less than what it should be and I can't imagine that horrific plot being turned into a movie....<br /><br />Skip it, you'll be happier with the entire series as a whole if you keep it to the first 2 books and don't read book number 3.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this has a decent variety of games that are fairly simple to figure out. each play earns you points to onlock more games.  just wish their were not so many ads.
B000089RV6|4.0|This album truly put the band on the global stage of the elite hard rock bands and restarted rock and roll for hte '80's.
1416583432|4.0|I was only halfway through this book when I left it on an airplane and lost it. It took me a week to get a new copy, at which point I had completely forgotten most of the notes I had made in the first few chapters. If you can avoid this problem you should read it, and do so continuously because it has a flow that serves it well. The book is about dogs and the study of dogs but in the scientific rather than the ownership sense.<br /><br />This means she did real experiments, is a real expert and isn't just passing along personal observations. At the same time, she uses anecdotes from her dog to illustrate and explain her findings. The result is a nice mix between one of those unreadable books from a college professor and something you'd see on Oprah. The author is well-read in other fields, a skill she uses to tie in a bunch of interesting tangents. She spends a bit of time talking about flicker-fusion rates which are worth learning about. She also uses the concept of umwelt - an organism's understanding of the environment around it - which is an interesting exercise in empathy. If you've read Cesar Milan's book(which I like) this is a good companion.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This is a great app. if u knew how to use your kindle or phone u would know how to search for something.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Am an avid reader of sci fi and fantasy! Found this book recently! Very good book! Starts out small and develops into an entire new world! Excellent read! Hats off to the author!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|\\"Holy crap\\" says Anastasia.  I think that's the extent of her world view and opinion.  But it's so apt for this book.  I read such glowing reviews and from people I know.  Ummm, not sure if they were referring to a different book because this book...  Well, I wanted to yell \\"laters, baby\\" 100 pages into it.<br /><br />Where to start?<br /><br />1. Editing--was the editor asleep?<br /><br />2. One-dimensional character-- can't figure how Christian fell in love with the heroine, Anastasia (Do NOT get me started on the names!).  The author did a better job at creating a complex hero, but just marginally. Anastasia, on the other hand...I'm not sure if I was ever this immature even when I was 12.  Her internal dialogue was annoying, distracting, and redundant.  Just as annoying as the eye rolling.  Why is every one eye rolling in this book?  I can't figure out if this was written by a teenager or even geared towards teenagers, but given the amount of sex in this book, I sincerely hope not.<br /><br />3. I read Twilight (as I bow my head in shame), and I thought this was worse than Twilight.  Only to find out this was based on Twilight???? Which figures.  If one is to write something based on something else, can't that something be at least a decent novel?  Say, something that Jane Austen has written?  Even Nicholas Sparks would have been a preferable model.  Maybe, just maybe, then this book would not have sucked a$$ as much as it did.<br /><br />4. The writing. Dear Lord, the writing was so amateurish.  Perhaps, in the hands of a good editor this could have been elevated to a more palatable work but absent both an experienced author and editor, it's so abysmally bad.<br /><br />5. I read a lot of books.  Varied books, and I rarely think \\"I can write better than this\\" because I know how hard writing a book is, or writing in general.  But this author makes me think \\"I can write better than this.\\"  In fact, it made me think \\"My 3rd grader can write better than this.\\" Seriously.  I should probably post what my child writes to make a point and show that I'm not exaggerating.<br /><br />6. End of Book One--they don't even attempt to wrap up Book One so you have to read Book Two to see what happens.  For $10 a pop! No, thank you.  I got suckered once. I'm not getting suckered twice.<br /><br />7. The inner goddess?  Really?  I wanted to kill her towards the end of the book.<br /><br />8. This book makes me sad. So sad because I know there are so many worthy books out there that do not get this kind of attention, and authors who write so much better but cannot get published.  It also makes me sad what kind of crap we love to read.  This books, I think, says more of our generation, our culture.  That we prefer this crap rather than to read books such as Voice in My Head or Book Thief, or even funny, witty books like Bossypants--gosh, Tina Fey would be aghast to see the kind of crap that gets published and read.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|I remember seeing the adds for this movie thinking It looks very funny. Well with kids and all I never made it to the theater to see it.  However I did purchase it the day it came out on video.  It is very silly and funny movie.  Anyone who has seen or enjoyed many of the alien and sci-fi films over the years will get a good laugh out of the all the references and connections.<br /><br />I read some other reviews that this movie like so many somehow offended some religious groups,  wow thats sad people can't lighten up and enjoy a good light hearted laugh sometime.<br /><br />Anyway this movie is more than just site gags, its a buddy film, a chase film,  and a little romance.<br /><br />If you like silly, funny and aliens this movie is for you.<br /><br />palnudb
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|This is an ok app. I don't get why everyone is ubsessed with it because I find it a little boring.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I read the first book and kind of liked the storyline and i wanted to know what happened next.  The writing is very weak and the author should have perhaps taken a little more time to not use the same phrases over and over again.  I find myself skimming the sex scenes because they are so boring and repetitive.  I find Ana less likable in this book as she is so immature.  I started reading these books because of the reviews on the Today Show where the women my age (late 30s) said it was so good and gave them a lot to talk about.  I would like more story and less sex.  I suppose to a 20 year old sex is the answer to everything but those of us with a little real life under our belts along with kids and real problems recognize there is so much more than that to a real relationship.  Plus honestly, even when I was 20 I wanted the love and communicating along with the sex and didn't want sex 10 times a day). I am way more annoyed with this book than the first and I will not be buying the 3rd.
B004X6PRO6|2.0|Very slow moving and a waste of time.  Gained some insight to North Korea, but not enough to suffer thought this what seemed long very longgggggggg book!  Not worth the hours I will never get back!  I am not sure what everyone else seems to love about this novel!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is such a well acted show, you feel as if you are right there with them. Love it, can't wait for season 3 with Shirley McClain.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this classic game! Out of all my games, I play this one the most. Everyone loves card games and this one is the best.
B005XI4WFS|5.0|This show is fantastic - smart, nonlinear, really twisted at times and legitimately scary. The only thing that scares me more is the fact that shows like this - the kind that require some amount of mental investment from the audience - tend to get cancelled. I hope they can keep this level of quality up in subsequent seasons.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Alright, so first off while reading this book I discovered one very important thing. Do NOT judge a book by it's cover! DO NOT! JUST DON'T! So,  hadheard many peple say that the Hunger Games was just AMAZING, I had seen the book before but honestly paid no heed because just bu looking at it my reaction was , 'Okay, so lets see there's a bird on a pin on the cover. Mabey it has magucal powers or something. Or even people are dying and there's no food.' Okay, so I hate books like that, they just simply annoy me! How are you supposed to relate to such a book? But taking my chances, following my instincts, and listeing to all of my friends I went ahead and bought the book. So I read the first few pages, and was just like 'BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER.' So  closed it andjust left it there, but the about a month later all I was hearing about was The Hunger Games! And the of course the movie! So I opened it again, and simply fell in love. This book is captivating in every way. Suzanne Collins has a work of art here. Every chapter ends with something that wants to make you read more. Might I mention  finished this book in six hours, this book is just amazing. I highly recomend it to everyone I know.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|now that the force close is fixed the game is working great. fun game of combining different objects to create new ones.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I have had this sharpener for about two months and I love it. I keep it with me whenever I have my knife so I can just pull it out and sharpen when I need to. It's light weight and small so it fits in your pocket and is very easy to use. The only complaint I have is that its only practical for thinner blades so not good for a large knife. Other than that though is an all around great sharpener.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I don't have it but I really really want the reviews say its cool and a great fun game and this is the best cut the rope game ever I do love the first so I'm sure I will love the new ones too
0691126658|4.0|I think this is one of the best-arranged field guides around. As you can see from the photo I've uploaded, the artwork is great, the plates not too crowded and the illustrations just the right size. Species accounts contain just the right amount of information. The only possible flaw I can think of is that some species would do better with one or two extra illustrations to show flight or alternative angles, and the monocoloured range-maps would be better if color-coded to show status.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I bought a Blu-Ray player just to watch this series again.  Technically, the picture is superb, even in low light.  The sound is fantastic.  I only have a 5.1 set up, but the DTS Master Audio is incredible.  I can't wait for the second season to start April 1.

000744902X|4.0|Probably the ultimate identification guide, packed with concise and useful field information.<br /><br />It is very hard to find any flaws to this book, but here it is: the illustrations, while being of good quality, are a little too small. The fact that each species has several, showing different postures or activities, enhances the ID value, although there comes a point where the page begins to look too crowded.
0553386794|3.0|I did finally finish this book!  I LOVE this genre and violence doesn't bother me (except in real life), so why did I think it wasn't so great?  Because everyone was raving about how good it was, I started right in.  Got to page 100 and quit.  Kept hearing how great it was, and that time got to page 300, and the athor was STILL introducing new characters and new kingdoms and new places and alliances even though there were already way to many to keep track of.<br /><br />Because I watched the DVD series, my third attempt to read the book was successful!  After I saw the videos, I could keep up with the book much better.  I do plan to continue with the series but most likely just the video version.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|I'm know the app is a really good representation of real life UNO, because ive played this same game on my iPhone. I'm not one of those people who rates an app 1 star, especially when i know the performance of the app elsewhere. but i really wish i could get my 99&cent; back! :(
B007MNV5WU|1.0|first it was &quot;angry birds&quot; then &quot;angry birds seasons&quot; now &quot;angry birds space&quot; Camon cant they keep on app like really!! its too expensive it should be free! like really,  i remember when bread was 25&cent; ! and gum was 5&cent;!!!!
B00511PTWM|1.0|HI,<br />How hard is it in the 21st century to make a plug in device for a car?  This one fails that task.  The plug itself will not stay in the socket.  Power loss to the device from coming loose is CONSTANT.  Do not buy this its pure junk!
B005VT42BS|5.0|not only will it list all IP addresses and MAC addresses on the network but will tell you what ports are listening on those devices
B007MNV5WU|4.0|I enjoyed Angry Birds when it first came out.  Then it just got kind of stale.  It really turned into the same thing over and over again, and what really irritated me was that at times it seemed luck there was an element of luck that was necessary to get the highest scores.  I didn't like that.<br /><br />So I haven't played the game in quite a long time, instead focusing on games that don't seem to have that luck element to them.<br /><br />Now, I'm sure that Angry Birds Space will end up having the same type of luck issue that I haven't liked for so long, but for now it seems like a fresh take on the franchise.  I like the way that the physics are affected by the things in space.  It presents a new and fun challenge.<br /><br />Overall, it's got the same type of production values that made the earlier games so great, so I think it's a solid app.  I don't know how long I'll like it for, but for now I find it truly enjoyable.
B003EYVXVE|5.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Sixteen year old Katniss Everdeen volunteers in her younger sister's place to enter the games, and is forced to rely upon her sharp instincts as well as the mentorship of drunken former victor Haymitch Abernathy when she's pitted against highly-trained Tributes who have prepared for these Games their entire lives. If she's ever to return home to District 12, Katniss must make impossible choices in the arena that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.<br /><br />The cast led by Jennifer Lawrence (as Katniss), Josh Hutcherson (as Peeta) & Liam Hemsworth (as Gale) is excellent. The directing by Gary Ross (who also co-wrote the screenplay) is excellent. The screenplay (based on the novel by Suzanne Collins, who also executive produced) by Ross, Collins & Billy Ray is excellent.<br /><br />The music by James Newton Howard & T-Bone Burnett (executive music producer) is excellent. The cinematography by Tom Stern is excellent. The film editing by Stephen Mirrione & Juliette Welfling is excellent. The casting by Debra Zane is excellent. The production design by Philip Messina is excellent. The art direction by John Collins, Robert Fechtman & Paul Richards is excellent. The set decoration by Larry Dias is excellent. The costume design by Judianna Makovsky is excellent. The special effects design by Legacy Effects is excellent. The make-up effects design by Ve Neill is excellent.<br /><br />This is a well-crafted and well-made adaptation that is faithful to Suzanne Collins' novel. It is an excellent film that will keep you entertained to the very end. It will also keep you on the edge of your seat while your heart is racing and your mind is thinking at the same time. Jennifer Lawrence is excellent as Katniss and Gary Ross has done a terrific job on the screenplay and directing. This is one of the best films of the year and is also one of the best action films of the year, so far. This is also the bestfilm of the 2012 spring season.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|This book is delicious and addicting and Rebecca Hamilton has created a fantastic story that I never wanted to end.<br /><br />Sophia is a wonderfully real character and quite refreshing.  This book is definitely worth more than the list price!!
0439023513|3.0|NO SPOILERS<br />I really debated between 2 and 4 stars! It was a shocking book and far from her original two. I was definitely surprised and only kept reading after a few parts to make sure it ended well. The bad thing about this book is they took the things you loved most as a reader and ruined them. Even the ending although fine, could have been drawn out a bit more to address some questions. All the power thru the first two was lost in this one and emotionally draining. I only wish she could go back and fix/add on to the ending to make it all it could be.
B007CGLRWA|5.0|I loved this movie.  I am a teacher myself, and I have seen every film ever made about teaching and education.  This is one of the few, if not the only, movie ever made that attempts an honest investigation of our disintegrating school system.  I want very much to purchase this, but I haven't been able to find a copy.  Can anyone help me with this?  Thanks.

B004LWZW7Y|4.0|What a charming character Puss is! Soft Paws was not so much so, but good enough for one movie.  Perhaps they will come up with a more likeable character that is a equally as charming as Puss if they create a character for Catherine Zeta-Jones.  It was great for Puss to get his own movie.  Now perhaps one where he goes across the country saving damsels in distress, while doing other deeds of whatevs.

B002962RKE|1.0|I'll either have to be daft or be forced at gunpoint to buy this.<br /><br />It doesn't take a genius to build a show around some tried and tested popular songs. Otherwise, Glee lacks substance in terms of plot and storyline. It's basically a shallow and superfluous version of the other teenage movies and musicals. I mean (and it's a compliment), even High School Musical would have more depth and original music!<br /><br />I watched it on telly to see if it's worth the hype. Basically, the best moments are when the cast starts singing. After that, it's snooze time.<br /><br />What's with that plain Jane (Jane Lynch) character destroying Madonna's Vogue by substituting her own face in Madge's video? And grinning like a Cheshire cat with Olivia Newton-John? Jane looked creepy, awful and smug, like she just scored some brownie points. Is she a groupie or what? Methinks the men in the Physical video would rather go out with one another than with Jane. Loser!<br /><br />And those hand signs are just dumb. Someone is trying extremely hard to start a trend here. Well I've got one here and it's just one finger. Oops, am I bad.<br /><br />This one's a minus ten stars. However, since there's some decent singing, a lone star is given reluctantly. And those Glee soundtracks. Why buy wannabe versions when you can get those sung by the original superstars?

B000244FDW|3.0|Although fairly well done, when compared to the lighting, costumes, acting skills, and directorial choices of the 2001 version of Pride/Prejudice of Colin Firth & Jennifer Ehle, this set of discs does not hold a candle. Some of the dialogue is less effective, and the characterization of Mr Wickam is definitely strange. He appears overly benevolent and his lesser character is never revealed. Mr Darcy is so unlikeable throughout and never gains one's sympathies even through to the end. I could not bear to have Elizabeth Bennet marry him even though I knew she was supposed to and I knew he was supposed to be such a good man at heart. His countenance was still quite unlikeable.

1594744769|1.0|I thought this book was awful. Juvenile and not written thoughtfully, it seems a stack of odd pictures was found and from there a poorly-crafted story was developed. The idea - crafting a story around photographs - is an interesting one. And one I think could be done well. But this felt as though I was reading someone's student project.<br /><br />This book is for you if you're in junior high or are an adult who misses reading R. L. Stine's 'Goosebumps' as a child. Some light over-the-shirt action is the only thing that elevates this book from the children's section at the library.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|I have  read many of Mr. King and enjoyed them very much.  However, this book started very slow and I almost put it aside.  I kept reading anf was glad I did.  One of my measures of a good story revolves around whether or not I can see the character in my mind's eye.<br /><br />That did not happen in this book until around the 60% mark.  Once the action starts, you can't put it down.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00794LZTU Harry's War]]

0385341008|4.0|I thought about reading this book for a couple of years before actually doing so. In part simply because I could hardly even say the title without getting all tongue tied.<br /><br />At the urging of an acquaintance who said \\"oh you must read it\\" I gave in and learned how to say that darned title (albeit slowly) and settled down to enjoy the book very much.<br /><br />I do have a quibble. As a number of other reviews have mentioned several of the characters all seemed to have an exceedingly similar voice. For sure, Amelia was more sophisticated, Isola more country bumpkinish crafty, Dawsey more reserved, etc. but they all sounded somewhat interchangable to a degree. They were certainly all very fond of brusquely humorous observations and very succinct sentences. Rather like this. Each and every one of them.<br /><br />That is my only quibble and I forgive it.<br /><br />For perhaps the first quarter of the book, while I was enjoying it, I did find it quaint, leaning towards silly. As I continued to read I found it even more quaint but leaning less towards silly and more heavily towards charming and lovely in an old fangled way. If you can embrace the quaintness (and I think you should) this is a delightful read.  Delightful is an old fashioned (and I will use the word again . .quaint) term that seems to sum up the people who populate this story. Most of them, anyway.<br /><br />Despite the definite sweetness of the story overall there were sections of the book that made my eyes fill with tears, that depicted times and events that were as far from charming and sweet as they could possibly be. I didn't know about the terrible situation Guernsey was in during the war, I had never even heard of the todt slaves. How can that be? It seems wrong. I am English, shouldn't I have been taught that stuff? I learned plenty about the blitz and the incessant bombing of London by the Luftwaffe when I was in school, but Guernsey? Perhaps I wasn't paying attention! This book rectified that. I am glad I now know at least something of what happened there, and it has prompted me to learn a little more.<br /><br />I don't really know why, but The Guernsey Literary blah blah blah Society (sorry, still haven't quite got it) conjours up the same feeling as Three Men in a Boat by Jerome K. Jerome to me.  Even though that book was about something entirely different, set in a different place and time, written a century earlier and without a very serious backdrop like WWII and nazi evil at the core of it. As I say, I don't really know why the book seem similar.  It is probably just the amusing anecdotes and the apparent facade of innocence of another time.d that.

B0079KKJ3M|5.0|I'm one of those rarest of individuals who actually enjoys this movie.  \\"Toomorrow,\\" with the two O's \\"to make it more memorable,\\" is quite humorous and it has a certain charm to it that original audiences might have missed when it first hit theaters in 1970.<br /><br />The story centers around four university students--three guys and a gal--who have a band.  They've named their band \\"Toomorrow.\\"  Their goal is to enter a popular and prestigious music contest.  What makes their band unique is their particular sound.  One of the members plays a rudimentary synthesizer that he created himself.  The sound vibrations it makes are genuinely cosmic.<br /><br />So cosmic is the sound, it captures the attention of an alien race living in a galaxy far, far away.  The aliens have been to earth before eons ago, leaving an agent behind to observe the development of humankind.  When the aliens travel across space to track the source of this strange cosmic vibration, they learn it is emanating from planet Earth.  They contact their secret alien agent, who is disguised as a man and living in a conservatory near the university.  After beaming the agent aboard their orbiting ship (special effects were created by the late John Stears, one of the geniuses responsible for bringing the FX of \\"Star Wars\\" to the screen), the aliens notify him that their race is slowly dying.  The cause of death is a lack of sensory stimulation.  The aliens goes on to explain that a strange new vibration detected on earth could very well save their race.  The agent is instructed to return to earth, discover the source of the sonic vibration, and capture it on tape so it can be examined.<br /><br />Meanwhile, back on earth at the university, students have gathered at the main hall and plan on staging a sit-in in protest of professorial laziness.  The four band members spontaneously break out in song to entertain their classmates.  As the band is playing, the alien agent tracks their special vibration to theschool.  There, the alien invites the group to rehearse at the conservatory.  Of course, the band graciously accepts the invitation.  Once at the conservatory, the band breaks out in song and the alien records their cosmic vibrations.<br /><br />Back on the spaceship, the aliens test the recording and confirm that the vibrations will indeed save their race from decline and death.  The aliens instruct the agent to talk the band into joining the aliens on a voyage back to their galaxy to share the lifesaving cosmic vibrations.  Not an easy task to be sure.  In order to impress the band members of the aliens' need for their cooperation, the aliens beam the band to their spaceship to explain their problem in person.  The aliens tell of their urgency and make their plea.  The band members sympathize, but fear leaving earth, their school, their friends, and the big contest coming up.<br /><br />In a blink of an eye, the four band members are back on earth, seemingly as though they had just awakened from a dream-like trance.  They question whether they had just been on a spaceship or if they had dreamed the whole affair.  Nevertheless, the alien-induced dream ruse appears to have worked.  At least on a subconscious level, the members of the band are deeply concerned about the aliens' plight.<br /><br />Knowing that the band is on the brink of agreeing to help the aliens, the agent goes to work even harder to convince the members to make the journey through outer space.  He enlists the aid of a fellow alien to disguise himself as a beautiful woman to seduce one of the male band members, since sex to humans is a powerful persuader.  At this point in alien evolution, sex is viewed as primitive and rather silly.  The beautiful alien laughs every time her assignment tries to put the moves on her.<br /><br />Finally, the band gets word of a last minute cancellation of a contestant's appearance at the band contest.  \\"Toomorrow\\" is asked to appear in their place.  By now, it is clear to the alien agent that the group's conscience would never allow them to simply permit an alien race to perish.  The band enters the arena, jumps on stage and breaks out into song.  Knowing he has the band's full cooperation, even if it lies on a subconscious level, the alien agent signals the spaceship to beam up the band.  However, not only does the band (which is still performing) head skyward, the entire arena does, too, including the audience and dancing crowd.<br /><br />We assume the band is successful in its journey to the alien galaxy to share their special cosmic vibrations, thus saving the alien race.<br /><br />And just as the aliens had returned the band members to earth following their first trip aboard the spacecraft, making the band think it was all a dream, the aliens repeat their little ruse.  The band members awake in their own beds, each believing their trip to a galaxy far, far away was only a dream.<br /><br />But we know better.<br /><br />...............<br /><br />The movie \\"Toomorrow\\" has been circulating for years across our own planet in bootleg form.  There are at least three bootleg versions that I know of.  One is of the Japanese print of the film.  The soundtrack, including dialog, is in English, but Japanese subtitles appear on the right side of the screen.  The image quality is poor and appears to be a VHS copy of a copy of a copy.<br /><br />Another bootleg is of a print from Spain.  The songs are in English and sung by the members of \\"Toomorrow,\\" but the dialog is dubbed entirely in Spanish.  The image quality is fair to poor.<br /><br />The last is a bootleg from England.  The VHS copy of this bootleg has the clearest picture in comparison to the others, but I would still rate the image quality as less-than-good to fair.<br /><br />The DVD on sale here appears to have been made from the same source material as the bootleg from England.  The transfer is definitely from at least a second-generation VHS copy.<br /><br />Moreover, the DVD was transferred incorrectly, as audio only comes out of the right speaker.  However, the sound is crisp and clear.<br /><br />The film itself was shot and presented in widescreen (2.35:1 aspect ratio), but the DVD is encoded in the standard TV format of 4:3.  If you have a widescreen TV, you will see black bars on the right and left sides of your screen, as well as bars at the top and bottom.  The movie will appear as a rectangle in the middle of the screen.<br /><br />But for all its flaws, at least it's available.  US and Canada consumers should be aware the the DVD is in the PAL format, but is region free.  US and Canada DVDs are in the NTSC format (number of lines of resolution and frame-rate differentiate NTSC from PAL).  Unless the DVD player at home is capable of converting from PAL to NTSC automatically, US and Canada buyers will be restricted to watching the DVD on their computers.<br /><br />A little trivia:  The gentleman who wrote the incidental music for \\"Toomorrow\\" also wrote the opening theme song for \\"I Dream of Jeannie.\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed writing this review.  I hope you enjoyed reading it.

B004LROUW2|5.0|Genius. Absolutely genius. Murakami does nothing less than epitomize the art of excellent writing. He weaves a spell-binding, heart pounding, all-engaging tale. Profound characters litter the novel like landmarks. The hardest part of reading it is remembering to breathe while you do so.<br /><br />Additionally, Murakami scatters scant traces of advice for professional writers. So, besides providing an apt exemplar, he provides advice to improve the skills of aspiring authors.

142311339X|5.0|My grandson saw this book at a school fair, but didn't have enough money to buy it so I surprised him by ordering it from Amazon. He loved it and finished the book in three days. I asked him if he thought it age appropriate (he is nine) and he said he thinks \\"maybe it's for kids a little older\\". Then he went to the library and took out the next book in the series. His 10 year old sister is now reading it and she too loves it.
0439023513|5.0|******SPOILER ALERT******<br /><br />I wasn't all that impressed with THG. I was MAJORLY impressed with Catching Fire. But this book was a little different for me.<br /><br />The cliff hanger ending of Catching Fire made me pick this one up with no time to spare. It was way darker, more dramatic. While the writing was just as beautiful as it was in Catching Fire, I found myself empty at the end of this book. I felt lost and vulnerable.<br />I'm the kind of person that gets into the book so much that I forget there is a world outside of it. I forget that the book isn't my life.<br />So, naturally, when all hope seemed lost as I closed the cover, I felt it personally.<br /><br />Of course all hope hasn't been lost. Clearly.<br />A whole new world, a better world, has been made possible for the future. But I didn't care about the future occupants, I had fallen in love with the present ones.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong, it was very realistic, war kills people, war changes people.<br />But that's why we read fiction books, right? To have a better ending?<br />A happier outcome?<br /><br />The brokenness at the end left me horrified. So horrified, that I threw the book.<br />Actually, I had thrown it multiple times while reading.<br />But anyways, there was too much death and too much hopelessness for my taste. Despite the fact that they had won.<br /><br />Of course no cost is too much if it means an end to evil. But still. LET ME WALLOW IN SELF-PITY HERE.<br /><br />I hated the way too many people I loved died. I hated the way that Gale ended up in a fate worse than death. Had he died, I could live with that. Sad, yes. I would have been mad, yes. I probably would have even thrown the book again, yes. But to end like that?<br /><br />Unbearable.<br /><br />Now Peeta. I'm glad he eventually became mostly normal again. Because if Collins had taken him away too, I'm pretty sure I would have curled up in a hole somewhere and died. NO EXAGGERATION.<br /><br />Even when the people you had been rooting for since the beginning got together, it wasn't a victory. It was just slightly less tragic than it would have been otherwise.<br />The tragedy was brilliant. Trulytrulytruly. But I felt that some of the deaths didn't add to the plot at all. Had more lived, the whole thing would have been more bearable.<br /><br />Now that I'm done ranting about the ridiculous ending. (SUPER BIG SADFACE)It was still an amazing book. Despite it ripping your heart out without hope of ever getting it back, I would actually highly recommend this trilogy.<br />I also recommend you do not stop after the first one, because the second two are beyond amazing.<br /><br />I couldn't put them down, they were breathtaking, amazing, beautiful, and captivating.the people you had been rooting for since the beginning got together, it wasn't a victory.

0525478817|4.0|******SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />This book. OH MY STARS. (see what I did there?)<br />This book is amazing, intellectual, hysterical, heart-breaking, real... and I could go on.<br /><br />Because of her cancer, Hazel lives pretty much solely in the world of books and television. She's incredibly smart and funny but doesn't really have any friends anymore. In an effort to get her to make some, Hazel's mother forces her to go to what is probably the most depressing support group in existence. There, she almost kinda sorta becomes friends with a boy named Isaac.<br /><br />One time, Isaac brings his friend Augustus Waters and that's pretty much all it takes to get this story going. Augustus is attracted to Hazel for her mind. Because she's really smart, remember? He's the bold, upfront, tell-it-like-it-is, kind of guy. After about a page or so of witty banter, he invites her to his house. They become friends instantly, bonding over a book.<br /><br />This book kinda becomes a mini theme inside The Fault in Our Stars. It's so closely related to the original story that you have to wonder if sometimes Hazel doesn't forget it's not part of her own life.<br /><br />Through the local \\"make-a-wish\\" foundation, the Genie Foundation, Augustus qualifies for a wish. His wish takes him and Hazel across the world to Amsterdam to meet the author of the book. They have questions, ones that only he can answer. But he refuses. Now what?<br /><br />To Hazel, it appears that her stars just aren't lining up.<br />The book takes a dramatic turn for the worse and she begins to wonder if maybe life isn't about being noticed by the universe, maybe life is about noticing the universe.<br /><br />Everyone told me that I would cry my eyes out during this book. Which was probably totally accurate because I cry over virtually everything.<br />Needless to say, I didn't cry. I came close though. Several times.<br />The characters had a way of turning their crap luck into a humorous occasion. The way they dealt with the pain was by making jokes. And they were funny as heck. So just like them, I was saved from crying by the humor.<br /><br />Really though, this story is tragically heart-breaking.<br />The moral: despite the fact that all these children get to make their final wish through the Genie Foundation, they all have to come to terms with the fact that life isn't fair and the world isn't a wish-granting factory.<br /><br />This is the kind of book you'll probably need a dictionary next to you while you read, but it's 1000% worth it. I recommend it so much.<br />Not my favorite book of all time, but one I'm so, so glad I own. This was a 4/5 book for me.<br /><br />\\"Men, at some time, are masters of their fates.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|I've been meaning to read this book for quite a long time now. The recent release of the movie trailers have convinced me to go ahead and do it already.<br /><br />I was instantly bored, and the only thing that kept me reading was the reassurance from friends that it would get better further in. There was far too much telling and not enough showing. Which isn't really the author's fault at all. Stories that are that action-packed are incredibly difficult to portray in words.<br />I have a feeling the movie will do better than the book, but I have to give mad props to the author for coming up with such a great story.<br /><br />I thought the romance was played up too much. I'm big on cheesy romance, but they kissed every other word. It was kinda getting on my nerves. I knew Katniss wasn't really into him, but Peeta was killing me. I actually got pretty into the book by the end of it and was loving how much he loved her.<br /><br />Once I forced myself past the first couple pages, I actually read the entire thing in one sitting. I thought the author played the emotions of the reader (myself) very well. I was hating the capitol and feeling sorry for the tributes. It was a pretty emotional book. I felt that with more showing and less telling, I would have probably cried at least once. Maybe even multiple times.<br /><br />All in all, I skimmed a lot during the first part. Once it got to the actual hunger games, I was enjoying it much more.<br /><br />This is one of those books that I don't have much to say about. It's a book that speaks for itself. It's not one of my favorites, and I'll probably never read it again, but I'm definitely glad I read it. It's given me a lot to think about and is making me quite excited for the movie.<br />I only hope they do the story justice.
0439023521|5.0|I obviously didn't grow up under a brutal dictatorship or have to fight to the death in a warped reality show as a teen, but this moving coming-of-age story reminds me of some of the teenage realities that I had forgotten.<br /><br />Katniss and her peers are careful about every single word they speak, everywhere, all the time. They never know what will be overheard. They seem youthful to the adults around them, but every time they say something real, they say it with hidden meanings, within other words, so that they can express what they mean without the authorities around them punishing them.<br /><br />When Gale speaks out against the authorities that run their lives, it's only when they've snuck outside the fence and are away from everyone--she and Gale know they can't speak freely in front of Prim because Prim means well but might repeat what they say and get them in trouble. When Katniss says she's sorry to the red-haired AVOX girl, she says it within an order, so the girl will understand but neither of them will get in trouble with the adults. When Peeta says he'd leave the Capitol if he lived there, he has to make it sound like he's just homesick, acceptable for adult ears.<br /><br />They're always careful, all the time, always concerned about who's listening.<br /><br />When I was a teenager, we knew we had to be careful about what we said around who. Oh, you could talk \\"teenage rebellion\\"---within limits. But we knew what we couldn't get away with saying, and we knew who we couldn't talk freely in front of because they might rat us out to grownups. And sometimes we slipped up and got ratted out.<br /><br />And we knew that when adults spoke of \\"free speech\\" in the Constitution that it was just a bad joke, that we--as kids--couldn't say what we really wanted. We knew \\"free speech\\" was something adults wanted us to pretend we had, within their acceptable limits, to make them feel better--as long as we didn't say anything that they didn't like. And we knew we could count on the popular kids (the \\"Careers\\" in the book) to act like the system was all exactly how it should be.<br /><br />It's even more so with kids now, with the internet and facebook and their phones and texts. You see the video of the girl whose dad shot her computer because he didn't like what she said, or the girl who had the school have the police interrogate her without her parents because they didn't like something she said on the internet, outside of school.<br /><br />Kids today have to be feeling even more pressure to be careful what they say, everywhere, all the time, in case their parents or schools will get access or some other kid rats them out for saying something some adult doesn't like. They've always got to be careful to say what they have to say with a double meaning so that if they get caught they have an out. \\"Oh, I didn't mean I'd leave the Capitol because I hate Panem's government, I was just a Tribute feeling a little homesick.....\\" \\"Oh, my BFF and I weren't talking about sex with boys, we were talking about...um.... Hey, how about that Justin Bieber, he sure is cute, isn't he?\\"<br /><br />I can see why teens identify with this story and these characters, and I think it's a very important book. I'd urge parents to read it, and use it as a starting point to open discussions with their teens about backing up their teens right to speak even--especially--when their parents or schools don't like what the teen has to say.<br /><br />Parents--read the book, think about it, think about what it's like to live guarding what you say all the time (even when you're not under a horrible dictatorship, it's still not good), and use it as a learning moment.
1423101464|5.0|BASICALLY I read books 4 & 5 in this series back to back.<br />Like, I literally didn't get any sleep, I just kept reading forever.<br /><br />This is going to be the most unprofessional book review ever, but I've never really been all that pro to begin with.<br /><br />So here's what I think:<br /><br />THESE BOOKS ARE SO AMAZING AND YOU HAVE TO GO READ THEM ALL RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I DEMAND YOU DO AND I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN IF YOU DONT AND RICK RIORDAN NEEDS TO WRITE FOREVER<br /><br />I love this series so much I forgot how to use punctuation.<br />See?<br />Now don't you want to go read them?<br />Yeah, you do.
B000TX7B5U|5.0|Elect the dead could be another system of a down album...Serj´s sound is quite different from SYSTEM´s sound...There´s a lot of piano and the melodies are less metal too...Got some great stuff here, like SKY IS OVER, UNTHINKING MAJORITY, HONKING ANTELOPE, EMPTY WALLS and PRAISE THE LORD AND PASS THE AMMUNITION!!!! Besides 2 or 3 tracks, this is a GREAT album!!!! if you like SYSTEM OF A DOWN, you may like ELECT THE DEAD!!!!!
0439023491|5.0|Okay, so first things first, I have to admit that I read this with reluctance. I wasn't all that in love with the Hunger Games. I'm pretty sure I actually rated it 3 out of 5.<br />But then I started this book. It began great and just kept going until I could hardly stand it. It was gripping and amazing and you couldn't stop reading if your life (or bladder) depended on it. The details and descriptions, the characters and suspense. It was all just too much.<br /><br />If you stopped reading after THG book 1 because you weren't all that impressed, pick up the next one.<br />I'm not kidding. READ THIS BOOK. It's worth it.
B000002AS3|4.0|this is BY FAR THE BEST OASIS ALBUM!!! Besides 2 or 3 songs, all the tracks are the most inspired melodies noel created...SUPERSONIC, LIVE FOREVER, COLUMBIA and BRING IT ON DOWN are the best oasis done...Sadly, after the next album what´s the story they got a giant EGO TRIP that takes the band level down until the end...

B000002BBY|4.0|Man, it's really hard to argue with the posture of the Gallacher brothers...All that talk about being the BEST band of the world or being at the same level of the BEATLES?!? Also, oasis live shows TOTALLY SUCKS!!!! liam stands blank and static without ANY interaction with the crowd and the band is as static, without any emotion...Plus, i think they were the most OVERRATED band of all time!!!!Come on, even BLUR and BUSH were way way better than OASIS...But, what's the story is a good collection of songs...All the songs are really inspired...after this album, they TOTALLY lose their way and start to record really uninspired records!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I bought this for my Nikon D5100, as I was unhappy with the results of the built in flash.  This unit works really well.  It is compact, charges very quickly, with the simplest of controls.  As you can swivel the lamp, you can get some great bounce-flash lighting, which makes a VAST difference to pictures.<br /><br />Really great value.  If you want something simple to use, without too many bells and whistles, this is a great choice.
B000002C25|3.0|this is the last good album by oasis...DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, MY BIG MOUTH and ALL AROUND THE WORLD are good tracks, but most of the album are not inspired like the first 2 oasis album...After be here now i totally lost my interest in oasis...Their live shows most be the worst shows ever...Some good rock songs, but the completelly static posture os liam and the TOTAL boring posture of the band...Man, try BLUR or BUSH...It´s from england too, from the same time but is WAY WAY BETTER...

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Just finished watching this and all I can say is WOW!.  This followed the book about 99% of the time.  Loved it.  I know they couldn't cover everything that the book does but they put the main points across quite well.  If you liked the book, you would definately like this series.  I read alot of people complaining about the nudity.  You read about nudity in the book but complain when you see it.  Get over it.<br /><br />Over all, I would recommend this series to anybody above the age of 18.

B004UID2LC|5.0|I love this app!!! you can get all of the vidios you want. :) you should get this so you can have some fun too
B0067Q42BY|3.0|Bought this app after playing the free version and initially loved it. Of course, my goal was to collect all the artifacts and was doing really well until I got to the \\"Play Endless\\" portion of the game. When I had successfully removed 69 levels, the game kicked me back to the main menu and there was no way I could restart where I left off. I've tried several times, with great frustration, to complete all the levels, but the darned game crashes anywhere between the 50th and 69th \\"Endless Play\\" level (the farthest it's let me play). I am not a happy camper! Sure wish the creators would fix this annoying glitch! Otherwise I love the game...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Lots of fun!  Addicting! The games are quick and a great way to pass time.  I like the unlock games feature.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like this app a lot. I moved from the north to Birmingham and am very weary of the weather down here. After last April I decided to download the app. It is great. I like the radar the most. It also has the warning information and if your a gardener, the 15 day forecast gives you a good idea of upcoming temperatures for your region. Get this app. Its free and works seamlessly on the fire. 10 stars!
B006M4F67A|5.0|An entertaining game with lots of variety.  Very addictive; I can play all day and not grow bored with the screens.
B0062CTYRA|5.0|This is a different story with interesting & mysterious characters. The author has an excellent writing style, plus leading one on through the plot making it a page turner. I never did quite establish the time frame. There is much mystery all through the tale. A good read & I would recommend it.
B007HJ84ZK|4.0|First let me say, I have watched the entire first season of this very Compelling HBO series. The acting is Tremendous and the story while complex is Engaging. There are some flaws however. First, I think some of the characters makeup and costuming remind me too much of other past great shows like \\"Star Trek\\"....\\"Khal\\" for example and his people who are nomadic and fight from horseback look a lot like \\"Klingons\\"....right down to the \\"gruntings\\" of Khal himself. In fact, at times the people's and kindoms represented resemble a \\"hodge podge\\" a kind of \\"best of the rest\\" assemblage of costuming and makeup we have seen so many times before in other sci/fantasy epics. It only howver matters as a backdrop however. The cast is So Great in their performances it doesn't take away from the story. The Violence including the closeups of severed heads etc is really unnecessary. We can see the battles...the gore is not needed....nor is the sex which always seems to feature anal sex....what no missionary position?<br />And why are theese scenes necessary to the telling of the story? To me the scenes are another effort by HBO to raise the ante on their own Rome series and Showtime's GREAT Tudors series. Diappointing in my opinion and a reason I chose Not to purchase this one.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Much like the geeky girl I dated during senior year of high school, this book made me smile alot, laugh often, but never quite got me off.  It was good to read just for the entertainment value.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is fun, challenging, and FREE!<br />What is great is that is if you are a new solitaire player, you can opt to receive all winning hands. And if not, you can challenge yourself.<br />No harm, no foul, plus it's free, so if you don't like it simply remove it
B0006B3UEQ|5.0|...\\"The Terminator\\".  Vincent (Tom Cruise) was the terminator, Max (Jamie Foxx) was Kyle Reese, and Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) was Sarah Conner. Vincent shows up outta nowhere and moves about LA at night systematically murdering his victims who are related as being witnesses in some sort of pending drug case (phone book killer, anyone?) until the cops finally figure it out.  He is ostensibly relentless, unstoppable, focused and efficient (terminator like?) in his single mindedness.  Sound familiar?  Until finally, he is stopped by our hero, who saves the girl. Plenty of thrills, chills and spills, plausible action.<br />I'm not hollering \\"plagiarism\\".  And don't get me wrong, \\"The Terminator\\" was one of my all time fav's.  Just wondering how many others saw the plot similarities.<br />Cruise was totally credible in his role.  Jamie Foxx deserved the oscar nomination for his work.  And critically the end, which is where so many otherwise promising flicks go down in flames,  did not disappoint.<br />Buy it...I did!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|It has a little bit of a story to it, but deep down it is still just mahjong. The music does start to get a little annoying.
B001P9EQH8|1.0|I bought this because I've been upgrading my sound equipment and have been wanting to get the best sound that I can possibly get with them. I'm new to the advanced audio stuff and never really messed around with headphone amplifiers before so I just wanted to get something so I can get an idea of what they do and if they're worth getting in to.<br /><br />This in particular I do not recommend. I tested this out with a cheap $5 set of ear buds, a $100 pair of inner ear buds and a $180 pair of head sets and the difference this made with all of the headsets is fairly minimal. For the most part, this is just a volume booster.<br /><br />There are two different settings on this. \\"Flat\\" and \\"Bass\\". \\"Flat\\" is basically what you would hear anyway through your headset but if you typically listen tom something on your player at volume level 10, you would be able to reach that same volume at 6. The \\"Bass\\" feature gives slightly more bass but in return it also muffles the treble a bit for a very slight boost in bass.<br /><br />As I said, this is essentially just a volume booster. It basically lets you reach level 10 volume at level 6 or can take you player's volume from 10 to 14 but doesn't really do much to enhance the quality of the sound, just the volume of it.<br /><br />I don't not recommend this at all. Do some more research. Unfortunately, I don't think you can find these that easily at retailers and it's even more difficult to find some to try out so you can experience it for yourself.<br /><br />I mainly bought these just to see that the deal is with headphone amplifiers and with these, I find nothing of real significance.<br /><br />I do not recommend these for any reason at all.
B005K17RU0|5.0|great app for the tablet... no need to pay for the full version if you don't mind the adds. enjoy the great maps and extended forcast

0385737947|5.0|The author was absolutely brilliant at writing this book. Thomas is thrown into a place where he knows nothing at all, and just when he, and the reader, are starting to figure out whats going on...BAM! Your hit with another suprise. Sure, you'll be in the dark for half of the book, but its written with such a perfect balance of learning what is going on and saving the day that you have to love it.<br /><br />The Glade (place where the boys are being kept) in in the center of a huge maze that changes every night. The doors to the Glade are shut every night to protect the boys from these terrifying creatures that come at at night called Grievers. The inhabitants of the Glade are all boys and the've created their own system of survival (farming, raising animals, building, janitorial business, etc.). All of the boys have been whiped of their memories and all they are trying to do is to get out of the maze. But the thing is, there is no way out. For two years they've been exploring the maze and when they reach the edge of it, everything just ends. If you leave that way you fall and die. As soon as Thomas arrives, all hell breaks loose. Because the day after he arrives a girl appears. The first girl, ever.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|To be honest i did not get to see this movie when it was in the theaters because i assumed i would be disappointed.<br /><br />I was wrong. After hearing so many people enjoyed this movie i got it and watched it at home. I am sure the effect in theaters would be great but i was still blown away with how enjoyable the story was and the fact that i did not find myself anticipating everything that would happen but instead was drawn in and taken along for the ride. I even found my self getting a little misty eyed at the end.
B004LWZW4W|3.0|It was a nice twist on the series and I enjoyed it. Would love to see it continue, was very interesting.
B005HWUBZ0|5.0|I absolutely love Mayer's music - when I first heard \\"The Walk\\" I had to hear what else was on the CD.  Talk about music that makes you feel good - it is definitely a mood changer.  I play it constantly in my car and everywhere.  You can definitely hear the soulfulness that he grew up with and he was able to make it his own and draw people into it.  You must buy it.  Do yourself a favor.

I want to be able to make notes during the week of errands that we need to do, items that need to be bought, or even things that we want to check out on the internet when we get home.  This fills the bill.  I think it is great
B0055SWM08|4.0|Very good game. Excellent atmosphere for a puzzle game. I like the window backdrop. only played through a few levels but have been satisfied with the experience so far.
B000FC13E0|4.0|This was the first book of this kind I have ever read. And I could not put it down. I felt like I was right in the story. I really liked this book and I usually don't pick up any type of science fiction.

034544678X|5.0|I have heard alot about this book as recommended reading for dog owners. I have read other books by Ceser Millan, Diane Bauman, Brenda Aloff, Stanley Coren and Turid Rugass all of which were very good in their own right. However, I found \\"The other end of the leash\\" one of my favorite books to read. I love her common sense approach to problems that people have with dogs. She states that most problems seem to be handler errors in not understanding the K-9's point of view in the interactions between humans and K-9's. How true this is. I think this is why Ceser Millan says he rehabilitates dogs and train people.<br /><br />If all dog owners read this book I'm sure they would have a whole new idea of what a dog owner should be like, I did.<br />I understand now why this book is one of the best sellers of \\"man's best friend\\".<br /><br />Thank you Patricia McConnell for all the help you have given to all the dogs by just writing your book. You have helped me!

0865479186|3.0|Ben Goldacre's book can't manage to be as entertaining as watching him speak live :-) but it was eye-opening. Read it and you'll basically never trust anything you read in the news media about the latest stunning discovery of medical science again!<br /><br />Now that I've read it, it's a little less of a mystery to me why science has lately declined so sharply in the court of public opinion. I used to think, \\"how much more obvious could it be that science *works*?\\" And I put all the blame on religious fundamentalism and bad schools. But while science does work, the book shows the many ways in which the perverted *version* of science that reaches us through the news every day really doesn't. It's actually a nonsense-generating machine, and it drags legitimate science down into the mud with it.<br /><br />The book is not an unqualified success. It's light on solutions, and it also falls short of being the kind of clear, crisp, accessible public re-education for the lay audience that would in itself be a key part of any solution. It's not a must-read, but I recommend it if you are interested in \\"this kind of stuff.\\"
B006PZBR8S|2.0|I didn't expect much from this movie. I was hoping for just something fun to watch on a Saturday night. What I was left with was a movie that highlights everything that is wrong with the movie industry today. This film looks great, sounds great, has great special effects, and even has decent actors in it. So what's wrong? That is all it has. It is poorly written.<br /><br />The idea of the film is interesting, battle robots meets professional boxing. They took that and packaged it with a father and son coming together story. I could still be on board with this, but than they take an annoying six year old kid and make him the smartest person in the movie. And that is not to say he is smart, it is just that the rest of the adult characters are unbelievably stupid. Hugh Jackman's character is out right despicable and makes decisions in the movie that are almost comedic.<br /><br />The whole movie is just lazy. Most of the scenes are drawn out and elude to events or ideas we never learn anything more about. Even the premise that the father and son luck upon a fully functional world class boxing robot in a junkyard is lazy. After a quick hose off of the bot, the worn down Jackman and totally inexperienced monster child are ready to conquer the world of robot boxing. All this being said, they still are able to drag the movie out over 2 hours.<br /><br />I know the idea of the film is silly, but a better story with better developed characters could of made this something more. Instead we get another Michael Bay like film, which younger people can't wait to fork over their money to see. This is why less and less adults are going to the movies, the shows on television are far superior when it comes to the writing and that is a driving force behind any story, not special effects or big name actors.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|its an entertaining game.  you can get very wrapped up into it and its hard to stop playing. get it!
B005ZUR724|5.0|This game is great to play. Runs smooth on the Kindle Fire and is really handy to be able to play an MMO of this quality portably.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|this e-bible is great!  Easy to use and access to many different versions at my fingertips. I also like the highlight and study guides available.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|This movie is not a classic masterpiece of drama destined for inclusion within a greatest films of all time listing - the title \\"Cowboys and Aliens\\" is probably a dead giveaway on that score. But fast paced action with frequent brief interludes of human interest holds this plot together very well. As to the story line, think \\"Independence Day\\" set in the Old West, only the good guys ride fast horses rather than fast F-18's. And it is necessary to introduce a \\"good\\" alien into the story so the viewer will come to understand what the \\"bad\\" aliens' motivation is - but even that gimmick works out well, except for the brief nude scene by the campfire which appeared to be gratuitous sex for the sake of gratuitous sex, although the movie's PG-13 rating demanded only discrete shots of alien buttocks.<br /><br />The actors and director make this movie work if you're looking for an exciting drama which is far-fetched without seeming to be all that far-fetched. And the director resisted the temptation to introduce awkwardly dramatic moments for the sake of artistic content. So, don't expect some drippy, overly emotional scenes which provide a convenient intermission to visit the restroom or fetch a soda from the fridge - this movie had none I could detect. The plot synopsis included by Amazon above provides the necessary story details but you'll enjoy the acting, you'll admire the way the outlandish parts come seamlessly together and how very professionally the director handled the hero's amnesia, usually a plot device which is over dramatized in more critically acclaimed films. Good veteran actors playing their parts well. And even your initial suspicion the actors must have needed the money badly to make this type of film will be dismissed once you realize how well-acted this film is.
0385523394|5.0|Piper Kerman writes about her life and focuses a great deal on her year of incarceration in a federal penitentiary.  To some - the cynics whose prejudice is oftentimes read in their words - Piper's book is simply an attempt to make money or make up for her indiscriminate decisions while exploring young adulthood.  But to me, Piper speaks clearly about what she is capable and especially about owning up to the responsibility that is hers.  Orange is the New Black is a realistic look at life on the inside of a prison.  There is comedy and there is satire and there is fear; of what is known and of the vast amount of the unknown - but mostly, Piper identifies the people - the women (strong and not so strong) who make up her community in the dorms and in the prison system.<br /><br />Her frank exposure of Corrections Officers' behaviors and mentalities is a universal statement about dominion over humans that I have read time and time again from other inmates and that I have experienced in my own life.  She is courageous for telling her story.<br /><br />To those who can only believe that financial gain is her priority for completing Orange is the New Black, I hasten those to idealize in her orange shoes what life might be like - for them, for their loved ones and for anyone who has ever made an error in judgment or who has fallen to unlikely influence and/or circumstance.  I remember a specific \\"critic\\" suggesting that I be \\"taken out and beaten with a baseball bat\\": how his philosophies changed when his own son found himself on the defense and facing a period of potential incarceration.  Piper helps to bridge the unbridgeable with her frankness and with her refreshingly positive attitude on how living her life was so vitally important to her - even in the face of losing her beloved grandmother while not being able to see her, hold her, and tell her about the love Piper had known for her grandmother.  A lesson here?  You betcha.  \\"I love you\\" should be ever known and eversaid.<br /><br />Piper's book educates, infuriates, exonerates, ameliorates, complicates, dedicates and isolates so many ideas and emotions and circumstances that reading it once is an entertaining adventure; reading it twice and sharing it with others is exhilarating and an expression of how important life - just one life - can be.  Piper, your life is important and your story is inspiring.  Bravo!!!<br /><br />F. Paul Muccigrosso II<br />Lancaster, New York
B0059XTTW8|1.0|When 10 minutes has gone by with the opening credits still slowly forming on your screen, you naturally begin to challenge your decision to view this movie. After what seems several hours of obscure names, including an honorable mention for the kid who delivered the morning lattes, the movie plunges into a confusing and disjointed plot line understood by no one, not exempting the actors and director. Flipping back and forth in a coherent manner between past events and present day is difficult to pull off within any movie, this movie fails miserably at that task - the viewer is often confused over whether the current time on the screen is yesterday, 50 years ago or tomorrow. You, the viewer, eventually realize the movie is about finding a traitor within the British version of the CIA, although you also quickly realize their dilapidated British HQ is in dire need of a complete makeover. At a point a short ways into this \\"who's the traitor?\\" plot line, you will probably realize you actually don't care who the traitor is if only the story would begin to make some sense.<br /><br />Perhaps fans of Le Carre understand this movie after having read the book, more power to you if the book was also this lethargic and obtuse. For those who haven't read the book, this movie asks veteran actors to give each other long dramatic looks consuming what can seem like  15 minutes per individual stare. This director's technique is meant to suggest drama but whether the stare is long and lingering, emotionless, quizzical or just plain bored, the constant staring doesn't make up for a slow paced, confusing  story which fails to draw the viewer  in. This should have been a movie for mature adults, no trick cars, no handsome James Bond type lady-killers but even mature adults deserve a plot you can follow and some skill at storytelling and creating drama. Save your money on this movie, you must have better uses for your time like re-arranging your sock drawer.

B007MLDC2I|1.0|As with any book produced into a movie, it's hard to capture the whole story with  full detail.  In my opinion they missed the mark with this one. The movie follows the book to the T, but if I hadn't read the book i would have been lost in the movie. The actors mumble a lot, so it's hard to follow the dialogue. The scenes jump so quickly from on to the next, once you do figure out what's going on they have already moved on two scenes. I suggest you save your money and read another book.
0812979656|5.0|When thinking about this book I want to describe it as food.  It was so substantive that reading it was like biting into large crisp apple.  Juice running down your face, wiping it away and following up with a bite of smokey cheese.  The contrast.  The textures.  It was savory and toothsome.  Layered.  Bitter, sweet, lush, tart, complex, satisfying. Rich; aromatic.<br /><br />The writing blew me away.  This is not traditional prose.  I'd compare it to Jeanette Winterson, but Jeanette Winterson taken to another level.  Deep and playful.  Evocative.  There were so many gorgeous passages, I wished I'd read it on my Kindle to keep track.<br /><br />For me, it didn't really matter what the book was about, though the story was good.  The reader is transported to India.  To the time and place.  To the people.<br /><br />In spite of all my gushing, I know this book isn't for everybody.  It's dark, and at times uncomfortable.  If you can deal with that, Roy is a master wordsmith and this book is recommended based on the writing alone.
