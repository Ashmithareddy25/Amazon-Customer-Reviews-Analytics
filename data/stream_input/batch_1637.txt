B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow!!!! What a story I totally loved it. I hated for the story to end!!! I read it twice I enjoyed it so much. I loved the erotic sex and what a love story. I was so into the characters I felt like I knew them personally. It was a fantastic book all 3!!!!!

B008N9AAQ4|3.0|Being a huge fan of Baraka, I eagerly awaited the theatrical release of SAMSARA this past weekend.  Setting-aside the absolutely stunning imagery, I felt the film fell short in editing and thus the director's translation of diverse images failed to achieve a coherant experience for me.<br /><br />The producers seemed to stay with the Baraka model without significant innovation. I felt the editing contributed to a sense that each theme (war, globalization, natural world, etc.,) was not fully expressed or formed.  In addition, the editing did not properly integrate with the musical arrangements to provide a more powerful emotional impact.<br /><br />If this is your first time seeing this type of work, you may feel differently, since the imagery and locations where the film was shot is worth the price of admission.  Others may just be satisfied with the imagery and sound design as-is.<br /><br />Ron Fricke is probably one of the world's best cinematogrpahers and like Baraka, that is evident in SAMSARA.

B008LSVL6U|5.0|This is taken verbatim from my last.fm journal. ID there is onthewall2983, feel free to check it out :)<br /><br />As of this writing, it's almost a year to the day Steven's 2nd solo album Grace for Drowning was released. In the year since, and as ever he's been a busy man. It's an overused word, but the passion he puts into everything he puts his stamp on, is equal to the actual number of projects he's involved in. Quality is rare enough in music these days, he also matches it in quantity. So the fact that his first tour as a solo artist is an event onto itself is no surprise.<br /><br />I didn't have the great fortune to attend any of his shows, so a document of the tour is obviously welcome. As with previous albums, it's a pretty neat package. Blu-ray/DVD and 2 CD's. The only way it could have been done better is if there was more material from other shows, rather than being from all the same one. But it is a minor complaint, especially considering the love the Mexico City crowd gives.<br /><br />Wilson states himself in the brief liner notes that many of the visuals director Lasse Hoile shot were actually taken in Mexico City during the making of Insurgentes. It's a very visual show, with projections in the back and even to the front via a mesh screen for the first few numbers. The building itself (the Teatro Metropolitan) is a piece of art, which adds to the overall flair to the film.<br /><br />That all said, the music is very much the focus. And the band is VERY focused. I don't blame Steven one bit for taking the majority of this group into the studio right away for his next solo album (again, busy man). They do justice to the original recordings for the most part, but sometimes straying away to make it sound more feasible live (as is the case with their version of \\"Abandoner\\"). Once again, a minor complaint because the band's energy and intuition make up for that.<br /><br />For his part, Steven is definitely the conduit of that energy and the band takes their lead from him. It's clear to me he's also more comfortable in the role of front man. Fortunately, his musicianship is still in tact and it doesn't appear he'll give that part of it up anytime soon. He switches instruments quite often, and most of the time during the same song. His singing is good, especially in tandem with bassist Nick Beggs harmonizing behind him.<br /><br />It's a little pointless now to say what was the highlight of the show, all in all it's got the makings of a great live record. He's absolutely on the right track with his solo career, and thankfully with little signs of slowing down.

0385344333|2.0|This is book 17 in the series - on the weak side.  The author's been writing Reacher for fifteen years, so I'm glad to see he's still hitting some home runs, just not every year.  (Book 15 was very good.)  The author can't change or grow the Reacher character, so he has to come up with new and interesting things for Reacher to do.  In this book, the plot was a new idea, I hadn't heard that one before.  But we don't see the bad guys doing things related to their plot.  It was not explained well.  It was just a reveal at the end.  Also, we are never in any bad guy's head.  I think the author should have picked at least one bad guy and developed him.  Another complaint was Reacher didn't do anything that surprised me.  The major shoot em up scene reminded me of generic-movie-style action scenes.<br /><br />Reacher did un-smart things which was out of character for him.  One of his talents is predicting others' actions.  He should have included a knife when he was arming himself for confrontation.  Lack of a knife turned out to be a problem.  Also, when he was making a call to 911, he should have told everything quickly to the first operator.  They record those calls.  Even if they didn't record it, she could have passed the information on later.  Instead he waited around for two operator transfers and had to hang up before he saying anything.<br /><br />The best part was the beginning of the book.  Reacher is a hitchhiker picked up by some bad guys.  That section had good anticipation, but it turned out flat.  It was not exciting or intriguing.  There is a lot of driving on Iowa highways during the book - too much.<br /><br />One predictably fun moment was when Reacher and others are leaving a hotel.  \\"They gave themselves three minutes to prepare.  Reacher didn't need them.  He hadn't unpacked.  His toothbrush was still in his pocket.  He was good to go.\\"<br /><br />AVOID THE AUDIOBOOK:<br />I'm glad I did not do the audiobook for this.  Other reviewers complained that the narrator spoke all of Reacher's lines like \\"my node id tuffy\\" instead of \\"my nose is stuffy.\\"  Reacher had a broken nose during the entire book.<br /><br />DATA:<br />Narrative mode: 3rd person.

0393327655|5.0|It doesn't take many words to argue against faith, but Sam Harris does a great job of laying it all out. Bottom line, faith is belief without proof. Which is just a ridiculous proposition.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|The film, Contact, spends nearly as much time debating faith versus science, and whether the two can co-exist, as it does in exploring the possibility of extraterrestrial life.  For this reason, not all science fiction fans will love the movie as much as I did.  Jodie Foster (as Ellie)turned in one of her typically stellar performances, and her transformation from a strict \\"Just the facts, please\\" scientist to a woman who accepts faith's role in the building of the universe was believable and moving, and it really resonated with me.  Matthew McConnaughey, on the other hand, was horribly miscast as Foster's religious and intellectual counterpart and as her sort-of love interest.  Fortunately, he kept his usual smarmy smirking acting technique to a minimum.<br /><br />I love the opening of the film which portrays a gradual pullback from a point on Earth to a faraway point in the universe before the visual zooms back into the eye of Foster's character as a child.  I can watch this scene over and over.<br /><br />Side note with a SPOILER:  I originally saw this film with two friends in the theater when it was released in 1997.  At the conclusion, both made comments about how bizarre it was that Ellie's father was on another planet.  Whaaaat???  I didn't understand how they could possibly have reached that conclusion, especially since the dialogue spoon feeds us the explanation for the alien's appearance.  I thought these two friends were the only people who could possibly have missed this, but in reading through some of the reviews and comments here, I see they were not alone!
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|I am such a huge fan of this series. The acting and story is A+. I cant wait for season 2!!!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Not knowing anyone involved with this story, of a courageous young man, who truelly is an American HERO, I was moved, touched and motivated.  I couldn't, nor did I want to put it down.  It's clear how much of an impact Adam Brown had on everone he came into contact with, no matter how brief that encounter was.  I'd like to offer my sympathy to the Brown family, for the loss of their loved  one, as well as my respect and admiration to all the Service Men and Women of the United States of America for all that you do, each and every day.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I was delighted to see Wicked this summer and wanted to re-live the excitement of the show again and again and this C.D. made that possible.  I downloaded it onto a certain portable listening device and can pull it up on demand and believe me I do!  I wasn't quite sure on some of the lyrics which is why I bought the C.D. instead of the download because it comes with a complete song lyric booklet as well as pictures from the Original Broadway Cast. I basically listen to it every day and find myself singing the songs in the shower. Love, love, love this C.D.!

B005I6EU7U|5.0|I have never bothered to buy a cover for my keyboard Kindle because there is plenty of edge to hold on to while reading. I hadn't planned on picking up a cover for my Kindle Fire, but found that there is virtually no edges on this device and I was constantly changing pages unintentionally each time I moved a finger. I bought the red cover and it is so very nice! I can hold it like a book or flip the cover back if I need to. The black elastic doesn't obstruct the viewing screen whatsoever and holds the Fire nice and tight. I'm completely happy with my purchase!
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I have an older Kindle, so when I recentely got an Android smart phone and downloaded the Kindle app on it, I began using my phone to read more than my old Kindle. And that was great for the first couple months. I would prefer more ways to organize my books, similar to the Kindle, and as far as I've been able to find there's no way to log out of my account/app once I've connected. But still....over all I like it and I've had no problems. Until today that is. For whatever reason I can no longer buy books via my phone. Instead of the store directing me to the app format page to buy, it switches to web where it says buying is not supported. If I have to purchase via computer, I might as well go back to using my old Kindle. There don't appear to be any updates since my initial download, and uninstalling and reinstalling didn't work either. I had changed my password via my computer account, but there is no way to do so on the phone app, so I thought that might be a problem. However, after reinstalling I am now logged in with my new password and still can't purchase. I can only hope this is a momentary issue...

B0025KVLVA|5.0|When I ordered this Limited Edition of The Beatles 'Past Masters', I had no idea it<br />is actually a 2-disc set with both 'Past Masters' Vol 1 and Vol 2 complete. From the<br />black jacket I thought that this was only Vol 1; I didn't look to see all the tracks<br />it contained when I made my purchase, so this discovery was a pleasant surprise!<br /><br />The quality of each of the tracks I've listed to matches the same high standards<br />found on the original albums.<br /><br />The fact that this 2-volume set costs the same as either Vol 1 or Vol 2 purchased<br />separately may make some hesitate, believing that the sound quality in this 2-for-1<br />Limited Edition might be less than the individual Volumes, but I did not find this<br />to be the case at all.<br /><br />In addition to the 2 discs, the set includes a 30-page booklet containing a brief<br />history of each of the songs and vintage Beatles' photos.  These types of booklets,<br />each with a different focus, come with practically all of the new releases of Beatles'<br />CDs, and I enjoy them.<br /><br />I highly recommend this fine product.  A Must for Beatles' people.

1449320104|5.0|I have been reading Albahari brothers nutshell-books since C# 3.0 came out and their website and publications have been tremendous help in learning and training. The writing and style of explanation brings tremendous clarity around the subject with their no-nonsense, to the point concrete approach. Being a coding-architect, it is always great to point to one source developers can rely on and C# nutshell series is a great introduction to language, it's constructs and idioms.<br /><br />This book is yet another great addition to the OReilly's nutshell collection where authors do not dwell on the obvious and rather do deep dives with illustrations where it is most needed. Like myself, you might be skeptical about the repetition of material but do yourself a favor and check out the contents; the book would definitely help you to be the first one within your organization to learn and understand asynchronous programming in C# 5.0. WinRT, CLR 4.5 and completely reorganized chapters on concurrency and asynchrony are salient features of this highly recommended book.
0345803485|2.0|First of all, let's get some things out of the way:<br /><br />Number one: I am, I freely admit, not exactly the target audience for this book. I'm male, for a start. I'm an adult. I'm in a happy relationship and not pining over Sparkleward from that Twiglet book or whatever he's called.<br /><br />Number two: I get that it's fiction. Thank you. I did spot that.<br /><br />Number three: I am not a prude. I read and enjoy erotica.<br /><br />Number four: There will be spoilers in this review. You have been warned.<br /><br />So, the review. The reason for the review title is that I was acutely aware, as I was reading this book, that I was reading a book. On those rare occasions where the story actually became engaging enough to begin to pull me in, it would only be a matter of pages before some serious piece of ridiculousness snapped me back to reality. I wasn't enjoying a story, I was merely reading a book.<br /><br />The first came very quickly. Ana 'falls' into Grey's office. Oh wow. What a clich&eacute;. Ana is a beautiful, drop-dead gorgeous clumsy woman with a smoking bod who doesn't think she's attractive. Now... where have we heard this before? Oh yeah... everywhere.<br /><br />What follows this are pages and pages about how mouthwateringly hot Grey is. His eyes. His hair. His physique. His exquisite nostrils. His wallet. His eyes. His expensive suit. His eyes. His left eye. His right eye. Ad nauseum.<br /><br />After that there's a lot of writing about this woman meekly accepting an abusive, overbearing, intrusive, insensitive, emotionally immature, violent man forcing her into a one-sided relationship completely lacking in empathy. Then she breaks up with him because he finally did exactly what she asked him to do. And we're expected to feel that this is some great romance to set fire to the skies and cause the angels to weep? Nah.<br /><br />The sex. I'm male, as I said, and I have a kind of inbuilt erotic-o-meter. It came with the body. When the erotica is good, the pointer starts to rise. Here? Nary a twitch. Oh, so there's tying up and spanking and yawnIjustdon'tcare. The sex was, for such a 'dark' book, bafflingly mainstream. Oh! Squee! He tied her up with his tie! How deliciously perverted! I think not. And the few places where there was a hint of darkness was purely because the author is completely clueless. Cable ties? Really? Would you like to use a lifeline or is that really your final answer?<br /><br />What's terrifying is that people keep talking about this as some sort of guidebook to the world of BDSM. Please, for your own safety, look some things up. Start with this one: The relationship desired by Grey is not a sub-dom relationship. It is a master-slave relationship. It may seem like a petty distinction but it is a vital one.<br /><br />Next, briefly, 'effect' and 'affect' are not synonyms. Look it up.<br /><br />Money. Another clich&eacute;. Grey's rich. Loaded. Flush. Got da moolah. Big time, megabucks, cover of Forbes, cannot even count his dosh rich. But, in order that Ana not come across as a blatant gold-digger who will put up with any degradation for the wonga, we have a couple of token protests about not wanting Grey to spend his money on her. Having made a nod to feminism, we then promptly go out and enjoy his cash and the lifestyle it buys.<br /><br />The biggest problem for me, though, was the complete failure of the reality check. Ana just does not react the way any normal person would to Grey's &#34;I have an entire page on the sex offender's registry&#34; style of courtship. Every time I thought that Ana might finally work herself up enough to actually get mad at Grey it just fizzled. Case in point: Ana takes herself off for a few days to visit her mother and her mother's new hubby. She specifically tells Grey that she needs the few days alone to think, to clear her head. So when Grey puts on his Stalker Head (hardly fair, he never takes it off) and follows her--and sits watching her andher mother drinking in a bar--you would, like me, think Vesuvius is in the offing. I actually got to the bottom of the page where she realised he was in the bar watching her and, as I turned the page, thought &#34;Oh hell, this is it. This is the big fight everyone was talking about.&#34; No. No fight. Just more breathless descriptions of how beautiful Grey is. I think the word 'moist' might have been in there but my brain shut down for its own protection at that point and projected a movie of a Jack Russell dressed as a clown dancing on his hind legs on my mental screen.<br /><br />This happens time and time again. Grey steps over a line, Ana gets mad for about... that long, and then we move on. Almost exclusively to sex. Grey growls, gets intense, Ana says &#34;oh my!&#34; and the Jack Russel comes back for another dance.<br /><br />Stalking. Emotional distance. Selfishness. This is the Romance To End All Romances?<br /><br />The lesson of these books, if one there be, is that rich, good-looking people can get away with whatever they like. If Christian Grey were a plain-looking Burger King manager instead of a pantie-moisteningly hot billionaire owner of a massive corporation, this series would have ended with his arrest for stalking and sexual assault by about chapter ten and, probably, an epilogue wherein he learns of the other side of submission at the hands of his 300lb cellmate, Bubba.<br /><br />Not my cup of tea. But then, as I said, I'm not the one this book was aimed at so it's no surprise it missed.<br /><br />It gets two stars because, sadly, I've read worse. It was called Fifty Shades Darker.d he was in the bar watching her and, as I turned the page, thought &#34;Oh hell, this is it. This is the big fight everyone was talking about.&#34; No. No fight.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I found this book to be interesting and thought provoking on many levels.  It intriqued me as a parent, a wife, a legal assistant and a general reader.  The book draws you in and keeps you reading.  I was a little frustrated with the end that left you wondering about what the future held for the parents--wondering if you were them where life would go from the end we were given.  I enjoyed it so much I almost started at the beginning again as soon as I finished.

B0038W0OHQ|1.0|Mine stopped working after 6 months, no more sound from left ear. It's not just me, there is a lot evidence of similar cases all over internet, like newegg's reviews.<br /><br />This headset is pure marketing. It's overpriced. Real price should be like 30$.<br /><br />The sound is not good at all for music or movies due the optimized bullshit gimmick for hear footsteps. The bass is non-existent.<br /><br />The voice quality of the microphone is not great either.<br /><br />The possibility of retract the microphone didn't impressed me. It's just another marketing gimmick .<br /><br />Interchangeable ear cushions was something interesting, however I only made ONE change before the left speaker blew out.<br /><br />For last the feature to disassemble the headset into 4 pieces is useful ONLY if you travel a lot with it. If not (like me), it's a useless feature.<br /><br />Cool design. I think the only good thing.<br /><br />I recommend to buy a headphone + mic clip. Why?  Most \\"gaming\\" headsets sound like trash and are just gimmicks to get you to pay 70$ for a 30$ set with a microphone. People from audiophiles forums recommends a separate mic that can be clipped onto your shirt, or sit on your desk or headphone's cable. Plus, the mic record quality it usually far greater. Audio Technica ATH-AD700 + Zalman Zm-Mic1 is one of the best options out there, and a I bought it after read a lot of reviews form audiophiles websites and forums.<br /><br />But if you need a set of gaming headphones with a microphone attached, all in one cable, that offer good sound for everything, conformable, good mic, build quality, buy the Sennheiser PC 360.<br /><br />Also, if you want the best form you headphones buy a good sound card like Asus Xonar series or Creative Sound Blaster Series. Like Soloz from overclock.net forums said \\"If you have trash audio going to awesome headphones, it's still going to sound like trash\\"

B00114RKT8|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Full of incredible actors, Amazing Grace tells a based-on-true story of political, social, racial, and religious drama, all interwoven in a very human way.  It is dramatic and affecting without veering into sentimentality.  An inspiring story of one man and his friends, and their fight to carry through an ideal that would make the world a better place against the staggering odds not so much of opposition but of overwhelming apathy.  Beautifully filmed, scored, and costumed, this movie will throw you simultaneously into the turn-of-the-nineteenth-century and into an impassioned world of social reform that, in varied forms, still exists and resonates today.  If you have not seen it, then you need to.  It will make you probably laugh, possibly cry, and definitely think.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I fought it for a long time. My girlfriend pushed me to read these books. However, as a grown man, a combat vet, and an overall pretty masculine character I scoffed at the idea of reading these books. I could not imagine liking any of them. I was wrong. I was very wrong. I thoroughly enjoyed each of these books. They were such an easy read. I found myself staying up late just to conquer a few more chapters.<br />I finished all three of the books in about a week and a half. None of them are a literary masterpiece. None of them are going to be read centuries from now. However, they are truly entertaining. The author puts you in the shoes of Katniss. She enables you to feel the struggle that the characters are going through.<br />I know that these books are meant for a younger audience, but that doesn't take away from the fact that they can be enjoyed by people of all ages. This is not a sparkly annoying vampire series (which I will never read). It really was entertaining and I will continue to suggest it to stalwarts who are \\"above\\" this series.<br />To caveat the books...you have to read them to watch the movie. If you only watch the movie you wont get what it really should have been.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Unbelievably good movie...This new franchise with all origins of these superheroes linking into this epic collaberation has met and surpassed my expectations. Between the easter eggs and keeping to the storyline and not being scared to be accurate as opposed to veering off to appeal to more audiences like in other superhero movies(ie. Thor with the story of Asgard and actively using that realm in the movie). I always loved comic books and these movies bring me back to my childhood, I even bought the infinity gauntlet series to catch up on those!
B0087ZG7FC|5.0|This is the first time i saw Scarface and it was a good way to see it, in full HD on blu-ray and the extras on it are easily a 10 out of 10.  This is a must buy for anyone that loves blu-ray and has a HD TV and that also is a fan of the movie.  Even if you have it already, i say buy this edition.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thought the book was great. I would recommend the book to other in my age group. It is a must read.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Let me preface this by stating I have been in the military since I was 17 years old. My mom had to sign my paperwork. I am now closing in on fifteen years of service.<br />I have a pretty decent background in military studies (in fact it was my minor in college). So I have a pretty good grasp of military activity and thoroughly enjoy reading about all things military.<br />This book was a pretty decent read. Don't get me wrong it is no literary masterpiece, but it was written by a Navy Seal so if you expected F. Scott Fitzgerald you are going to be disappointed.<br />In a world where the media and government provide \\"truths\\" that are not always what actually happened, it is hard to figure out what to truly believe. In this case the waters are as clear as mud. I for one believe that the truth lies somewhere between the author's recount and what the President's administration published. This book gives you that other side to the story. I don't know if I believe everything in this book 100%,  but I would lean towards believing most of it.<br />I enjoyed reading this book, and took it for what it was...a personal recount of actions that took place in one operator's life. I would suggest this book to anyone. I know that some codes have been broken in the publishing of this book, but as someone who seeks the truth, the damage has already been done and I have no problem paying to read this.<br />With all that being said, if this book is only even 50% true...it is a scary world we live in...where bad men do bad things and \\"good men\\" do bad things.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Shogun is with out doubt one of the best historical novels ever written. After reading it you will want to continue with the other 5 books that are part of James Clavell´s Asian Saga.

B0079XCML6|5.0|Streaming quality is great, sound is great, easy to navigate through and pick which episode you want to watch. Fantastic show.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|this book is one of THE most terrifying and at the same time interesting books I have ever read! I am absolutely loving it. Part of me would love to see it turned into a movie but Hollywood usually screws everything up and leaves out the best stuff so the other part of me doesn't want them to touch it. But done right, it would be THE BEST zombie flick of all time. I LOVE THIS BOOK
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I've played through Journey several times, for a few reasons. The first time I played the game, the typical \\"gamer\\" in me came out. The goal, to get from beginning to end, while trying to take in some sights along the way. After I completed the game, I got it. It hit me what the point was of the game, and I restarted my Journey again the next night. I spent more time looking around, and found little hidden symbols along the way. Then suddenly someone showed up in the game with me. You can't talk, or type in the game. They are just there. You can chose to run around together or not. These other people just drift in and out in the game, all on their own journey. After I completed the game a second time, I had spent longer enjoying the amazing music and the astonishing visuals through the game. I put it away and didn't play for a while.<br /><br />Then some time later, I learned there was such thing as players called \\"white cloaks\\". I wanted to see one, so I went again into the game and meandered around online. I met one who was on their journey, and decided to play through the game with them. We had so much fun working together. We had no way to communicate, we just had to use our intuition. We completed the game together, and it was almost a shocking moment for me. This game and it's meaning are so much deeper than one can understand on the first play through. The older you are, the more the meaning of this game will touch you.<br /><br />After working for a while, I finally found all the hidden symbols in the game, and became a white cloak as well. My red garment turns white when I play, and my scarf regenerates itself, letting me fly for longer periods of time. While the game itself is short, it's got enough content for several play throughs. There is an incredibly deep meaning to the Journey, it's what the journey stands for. It's who you meet along the way, and your choices of whether to go alone, or take the journey with someone else. You can't \\"die\\" in the game as others have mentioned, but that's because it would defeat the meaning of the game. I agree with what others have said. Play this game alone (not offline, just alone at your home without distractions of other people around), on the best TV you have, with the best sound and in a dark room or in the evening. You will get the best visuals from the game, and have a better environment for contemplating the full meaning of the game. There is much depth to be found in it's simplicity.as others have mentioned, but that's because it would defeat the meaning of the game. I agree with what others have said.

0071762345|4.0|I am not a social media person as some of the reviewers have identified themselves. Rather, I'm a training developer--who in the course of pushing training videos, eLearning courses, communication materials, procedures, online help, performance support, etc. out to my employee audiences--has noticed that employees aren't typically satisfied with what I or my corporate sponsors thought was necessarily the best way of doing specific procedures or following what we thought were best practices. Really over the past 15 years or so there has been much more pushback from people who should push back. After all, employees are the ones who typically talk to customers all day, every day so why shouldn't they have more input into what practices really do work best with customers.<br /><br />As I've seen this desire for more two-way communications developing, I've worked in jobs and roles where my companies or clients started to 'sneak up' on social media. They don't typically go out and purchase and implement social media platforms straight out, preferring instead to try ways of engaging their employees and some test customers so see how they might actually participate. I've read and reviewed several books written for executives and decision-makers who are trying to make up their minds whether and how they might engage their internal and external audiences. Books like \\"Groundswell\\" and \\"Open Leadership\\" by Charlene Li, \\"The Social Organization\\" by two Gartner analysts, \\"Get Bold\\" by Sandy Carter of IBM, \\"Social Business by Design\\" and \\"The Connected Company\\" by two Dachis executives, and \\"Outside In\\" by two Forrester analysts all come to mind. As these books have been published, they tend to focus less and less on the technical aspects of social tools and more on the business and cultural rationales for why organizations have to start engaging better with their communities.<br /><br />In \\"Likeable Social Media\\" -- which preceded some of these books just mentioned -- Dave Kerpen presents many, many common-sense recommendations for using Facebook to build relationships with customers, partners and other outside audiences. The message that all these books share is that consumers just have too many ways and reasons to stop trusting and hearing one-way communications and commercials from companies anymore. Companies that continue to play their cards close to their vests will soon see that their customers have moved on to work with companies that want to interact with them.<br /><br />I liked the way Dave looked at ways of building relationships in his individual chapters. As you get about halfway in, there seems to be some repetition. I wondered if he had developed these chapters around articles he had previously published. But even so -- as I worked my way through all 18 of the chapters -- there were great ideas for getting your organization started in building relationships. It seems that if you apply the ideas and rules that Dave shares, you'll avoid many of the errors that he and others have experienced as they learned what worked or didn't work.<br /><br />This book is also a little unusual compared to the others in his smaller use of case studies. Many of those other books seem to go out of their way to substantiate their arguments with the use of many case studies to show how things actually played out at real organizations. I like real examples as much as anyone, but I kind of enjoyed not getting hammered over the head with too many case studies in this book.<br /><br />Typically I try to read books that are new releases, but this book was published over 15 months ago. It's impressive to see people continuing to review this book at a pace of 1-2 per week over those months. That -- and the growing focus on social media as a business and cultural opportunity (rather than a technical opportunity) -- seems to indicate that people and companies are starting to jump onboard and build expansive relationships with their customers. This has tobe a good trend.be a good trend.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|I LOVE Vampire Diaries!  Didn't even start watching it until Season 2 was over.  Thankfully I found a way to watch all 3 seasons.  Can't wait for 4!  Love Stephan - can't beat Damon's facial expressions and cockiness!
B0098VYCCE|3.0|From the minute the movie starts, you know what's going to happen. Not because you know this story from your childhood but because it's not a well thought-out screenplay. The cinematography is actually pretty nice and makes you feel that you're watching a high-budget movie. The acting is slightly better than average but no great performances, except by Charlize Theron who provides a very interesting and deep portrayal of the \\"wicked witch/evil stepmom.\\" The plot stays on track but has little depth, little explanation, and ho-hum characters that simply act the part they are told and don't really bring them to life. Generally, an okay movie if you're bored and nothing else is on!
B00514HDNW|4.0|First of all, I am so glad that the book was completely different from the movie. Hollywood caters their visual stories to what they think will sell, and that is understandable. It is a story that is short but compelling in that it has a unique take on the \\"post-appocolyptic, zombie\\" theme, and does an awesome job at convincing the reader just how alone this type of existince could be.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|wonderful scifi book. I read it in a few days, and didn't want to stop reading! Good characters, great storyline. Excellent read!
B006LSZECO|2.0|The beginning was a little odd but then I found the Plot intriguing. However the ending was just too bizarre for me.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great fun. requires strategy - to drop coin on side or middle.  decisions.....  really enjoy. great way to relax after a busy day. but 45 coins is not nearly enough.
B008B0QH5S|5.0|Elysium shows us how mellow, yet very beautiful the Pet Shop Boys can be. It's a very different CD than \\"YES\\", but it always amazes me how they can depart from one type of music to another. Great music by Chris Lowe & Neil Tennant, and the more you listen to it, the better it gets.<br />It's a marvel how they can keep putting out CD for all these years, yet never repeat themselves. This is one Great CD to add to the collection.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|I initially had my doubts about a book written in the voice of a 15 year-old. But Canada turned out to be an absorning read. I would recommend it.

B006G3MZRQ|5.0|I'm not really too good at these and I don't really feel like going into detail about myself...but I don't really cry when I see movies. I'm also the one who usually can never understand why people do, but this film.....the ending....was so touching(No pun intended), that I actually cried. Not just that shed a tear stuff, but like I just lost my family, my home was burnt down, that kind of cry. Except I was happy, not sad. It was weird but definitely refreshing and felt really good afterwords. Is it strange to be happy when you cry? Cause I sure was after seeing this movie! Anyways, I just wanted to say this movie was worth every minuet of my time and is definitely a film all should experience.
0307716546|5.0|Well written and compelling, this is the proverbial \\"page turner.\\" I cannot believe this is only Lupton's second published novel. Written from the unusual perspective of a comatose woman who, along with her daughter, was injured in a fire, the book is written as though she is talking to her husband and viewing everything through an \\"out of body\\" experience, following investigators and family as they try to find out who caused the fire and why. You won't know the identity of the fire-starter until the end. Well done.
0385344333|2.0|Until A Wanted Man, there was only one Reacher novel I found disappointing and that was Echo Burning.  I had to actually force myself through this latest novel by hoping it would eventually get better....it did for a few short pages just past the middle and then went back to pages of unnecessary running descriptive dialog that was not the least bit interesting and had very little to do with whatever plot Lee Child was trying to build; I did a lot of speed reading in this one.<br /><br />Absolutely dry compared to the other Reacher novels.  What a disappointment.  I was also a bit put off my his recent description of Reacher; he took an entire paragraph in describing him not only as his normal 6'5 240lbs, but went out of his way in describing him to almost look like some kind of a monster \\"with hands the size of pie plates\\"...good grief.  And to add to all of that he gave him a broken nose that was split and taped together with duct tape....Was he trying to make up for the outrageous bad casting of Tom Cruise?  Who knows.  Worn out plot, extreamly weak bad ending that went nowhere...What happened? Don't waste your money...borrow one or get it from the library.
0307730697|5.0|This is very inspirational book. I am not a big reader but this book I couldn't put down even though you know how it will end from the beginning. i am going to recommend this book to everyone I know. If you are going to read it get ready to get emotional because it/ he (Adam) will move you.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Good movie for family movie night for 3 generations.  SPOILER ALERT:  LOVED the honoring of the WWII Veterans to help fight in the movie.  If you like stuff blowing up, the good guys winning, & the boy getting the girl...all with minimal 4 letter words...then you'll enjoy this movie.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I decided to read this book after wanting to know what the hubbub was about. I did finish the whole book, it had a good flow in the read. However, I felt it was lacking in the character's history. I'm really not into that painful kind of stuff, not even in a playful manner. It was decent but I wouldn't finish the series.

0618918248|1.0|(Please note this is based on my comments submitted to a 5 star review dated sept 28,2006 above)... Dawkins' 'The God Delusion' is not a serious book, and is certainly not 'scientific'. I was especially troubled by his equating religious upbringing with child abuse. The overwhelming evidence from empirical studies show that religious behavior (with it's implied belief in some sort of transcendent Divinity) is actually protective of health, including decreased risks for suicide, depression and drug use, all conditions that plague young people; it would be more accurate to say that lack of religious upbringing is child abuse. The interested reader can review the literature on the web or in many books such as 'Faith, Medicine, and Science' edited by Levin and Koenig, or a more popular presentation in Patrick Glynn's 'God: the Evidence'. The fact that someone who is part of the scientific establishment is unaware of such empirical data should be very disconcerting to those who take people and ideas seriously. Prof Dawkins is not only remarkably ignorant of theology but of most aspects of religion. He has stated that someone does not have to read up on leprechauns to not believe in them. True enought- I don't believe in leprechauns either, but if I were to write a book about their nonexistence, I most certainly would familiarize myself with the available literature- that is simply sound scholarship.  The American educator and philosopher, Mortimer Adler, found that of all the seminal ideas he was researching for his Synopticon of Western civilization, the idea of God was not only the most frequently referenced, but also cited by the widest variety of commentators- philosophers, poets, scientists, etc.; this is not the case with leprechauns, flying spagetti monsters, or Bertrand Russell's flying teapot. It's hard not to feel that this lack of awareness on the part of Prof Dawkins betrays a remarkable deficit in understanding human experience, no matter what his reputationis as a writer. A much better book is 'Questions of Truth' by physicist and theologian John Polkinghorne, who is not only serious about science, but about religion as well.

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is a newer game where using your finger instead of a mouse is quicker, faster, and more helpful so a good choice for a kindle with the touch screen.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|An interesting spin on the typical Holocaust story, providing an aerial view of the various perspectives of non-Jewish Germans during this tumultuous time period. The Book Thief is a beautiful story about love and loss, kindness and depravity, and courage and conformity viewed through the life experiences of a young girl,interwoven with the joys of reading and music. The book is narrated by Death, so you know you are in for a bumpy ride, but this journey is well worth a few (major) bumps in the road.

B00846REIS|4.0|I read the 50 Shades trilogy, and was looking for something similar to those. I was told by a friend about this book. She didn't like the way it ended, until I told her there were more coming. This book proceeds along faster than 50 Shades of Grey, which I liked. It's very different from 50 Shades, for those who have read them. It's still erotica, just in a different presentation. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to escape for a bit and have some fun in your mind. Bared to You is good, in my opinion. Some people say the characters are just too perfect looking, but that's what I like. If you want a trip away from the world, this may just be the book for you.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Lee Child takes care to work out his plots in detail. You also don't see the many grammatical and syntactical errors you so often see of late. He writes with care, builds credible characters and as always his tension line is superb. Really a writer you can buy without reservation.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book kept me up for two nights to finish - and I didn't mind the sleep loss at all. That's the sign for me of a good book. I liked the fact it was told by the 2 main characters. It made it more realistic and showed them in a variety of situations. Gave me so much information about this time in our history before the civil war - a time that does not have a lot written about it. While I knew there were indentured servants, I didn't realize they were treated like slaves - almost like a life sentence. Belle was magnificant as was her entire familiy. One of the few books I've read where the black people were the heroes and the white folk, for the most part, had the biggest failings. Albinia seemed to be able to move between both worlds as an adult, and yet you knew where her heart was. Wonderful read and I do hope the author goes ahead with her plans for a follow-up book.

1451627297|5.0|Finally, Stephen King writes a book that doesn't make you lock the doors or look under the bed.  This was such a great read that when I got done I nearly flipped to the front and started reading it again.  It seemed in some parts that it would be predictable but thats when King revved it up and grabbed another gear.  The detail was incredible and it flowed like clear as a mountain river.  Not many authors dare touch on the subjects in this book, but we all know that there is only one Stephen King. Epic.

I can hardly wait for the next one to release in March 2013!

0385344333|2.0|I think it's time to kill off Jack..all the family is gone and so has most of the excitement associated with his adventures.

B008LZHA3G|3.0|When does genius run thin and how do we praise the artist?<br /><br />Bob Dylan is a genius artist on the same level as Picasso. His talent is momentous, his style mercurial legendary and his works approached with some reverence.<br /><br />Which explains why I have writer's block making any comment on his latest studio album \\"Tempest\\".  It is just not up to the standard of his greatest works, inspite of all the gushy reviews published in the media.<br /><br />Everyone knows I am a Dylan fan since \\"Freewheelin' Bob Dylan'. I have every album, CD, video, bootleg, and some three times to have each version (vinyl, CD, SACD, VHS, DVD, etc). I've read more than 30 books and learned to play 100s of Dylan songs. I also know some albums take decades to appreciate.<br /><br />That being said, \\"Tempest\\" does not seem like a great Dylan album.  His voice is almost gone and the songs just don't have the appeal and feel of his greatest works.<br /><br />Perhaps \\"Tempest\\" will be like a great Picasso painting from his later period, the grotesque depiction of an old gnome lusting after younger women.<br /><br />Things start off well enough with the catchy \\"Duquesne Whistle\\" which got a cinematic gritty video treatment.<br /><br />The second song on \\"Tempest\\" is \\"Soon After Midnight\\" where Dylan croons,<br /><br />\\"I'm searching for phrases, To sing your praises,<br />I need to tell someone,<br />It's soon after midnight,<br />And my day has just begun\\" (words copyright Bob Dylan)<br /><br />Then Dylan lets you know his needs have also been serviced by some gal who took his money and assorted harlots and night people. Dylan covered the nightscapes before in \\"Visions of Johanna\\" and \\"Desolation Row\\" but with more finesse and artful language.<br /><br />There isn't much new musically, since most of the melodies are lifted from old blues or Celtic riffs. And the songs go on far too long. The last 5 songs on the CD are 7, 5, 9, 14 and 7 minutes long.  Dylan has written long songs before but most of them held your attention. On \\"Tempest\\" they just don't. One reviewer said he wanted to go for lunch or out for a walk, which is a humorous take on the over-long material.<br /><br />At the mid-point of listening to \\"Tempest\\" my mind was long gone. I had to force myself to listen to the second half to make sure I wasn't missing something great. My wife's comment was succinct \\"Not as good as \\"Modern Times\\" and turned it off when I left the room.<br /><br />The 14 minute long recitation of the Titanic story in the \\"Tempest\\" title song is boring. What's new in Dylan's repetitive narration of the tale? Nothing and the weak tune doesn't carry the song.<br /><br />It's great that Bob Dylan is still recording new material at 71 years old but the entertainment value does not seem to be there on \\"Tempest\\".<br /><br />Only time will tell if the 10 songs get elevated in public and critical opinion.<br /><br />I will freely admit this is a minority opinion. However, once you get past the hype in the headlines of the media reviews, you'll find similar appraisals albeit couched in code since Dylan is a national treasure.[[ASIN:B008LZHA3G Tempest]]<br />[...]anted to go for lunch or out for a walk, which is a humorous take on the over-long material.

B000OLEMOK|5.0|I'd describe this more of a (long) short story than a novel.<br />It's a little funny, a little sad, and very french.<br />tongue-in-cheek and nostalgic for a time when the word \\"mistress\\" was still in circulation, although already only in use in *some* social circles. when \\"40\\" was old, but wit and personality ruled.<br />I am actually surprised that it's taken me this long to discover Sagan, seeing as how I'm really into french 20th century literature, all of it.<br />If you are, too, then certainly have a go. Very fun hour or two.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  I'm one of those people who makes up my own mind and doesn't rely on critic's reviews.  I went to the movies to see this because I like Taylor Kitsch, who plays the main character.  He was on Friday Night Lights.  It also stars Liam Neeson.  With those 2 guys, how can you go wrong?<br /><br />This movie made me laugh, cry and kept me on the end of my seat.  As soon as I left the theater I knew I was going to purchase the movie.  Watch it with no other thought than to have a good time.  You'll like it!

1401322786|5.0|I am a huge fan of Mitch Albom. The day I found out he had a new book coming out I pre-ordered it here on Amazon. I liked the concept as I read the book, but I couldn't tell when something was going to happen. Every book has moved me in some way, whether it be his fiction or non-fiction work, so I had an expectation. I read this on the train and I was about 10 pages short of finishing when the train came to a stop. I was still stumped as to when the moment I had been waiting for was going to happen. I had been enjoying the book and I really liked that it made me think about time in my own life, but I never received the moment I was looking for. About an hour later I returned home and I cracked open the book. 10 pages left and I still couldn't find what I was looking for, that was until I reached the epilogue. Each of the last three pages had me exactly where I had anticipated. After completing The Time Keeper I decided to look at his acknowledgements, something I don't often do, and again he had me. I'll support this man regardless of what he puts out because of the man I believe he is. It would be an honor to meet him in person. His love for his wife and so many is something to really respect. His quote, \\" And to my faithful readers, the ones who picked up this book without even asking what it was about - you are the backbone of my work.\\"  This man has a heart I wish I could have, and I know that mine becomes closer to that with each story he tells. I look forward to the lessons he has to offer in works that I hope to come.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is raw and not for sissies, but it is very informative and real.  For a Seals eye view instead of the politically correct media, read it and cry for our men and women who serve.
B003O86FMW|3.0|The plot  borrowed too  many items from the first story. It lost much of the suspense and tension of the first book.
1400069289|4.0|I thought this book was so much fun and very interesting and informative. Most of the negative views seem focused on the fact that this was not a self-help book (self-evident in my opinion) and wasn't entirely scientific (author is not a scientist... why anyone would think a non-scientist would write a science book is beyond me). I am really unclear as to why some folks felt anger about the fact that companies were discussed. The book, per its table of contents, was about the habits of individuals, organizations and businesses. I found the case studies fascinating and a great illustration of the process. I loved hearing about Target, the aluminum company, and Febreze. I thought the numerous case studies really added to the book. It was also very interesting to think of why society treats certain habits differently (gambling vs. sleepwalking). Most people want to change their habits for the better - i.e., I've never met someone who wants to work out less, eat less healthily, be fat, be lazy, gamble more, do more drugs, etc, so I would expect that the author's examples would evidence that. As noted, this is not a self-help book, but for someone who is motivated to change their habits, I think it is a good read to provide the framework for doing so and a greater understanding of how and why habits form. That said, I can't imagine that any book would be entirely helpful in changing habits because habits are so individualized, which would lead me to think that anyone with a serious need to change their behavior might want to see a professional. But, for the nail biter or the person who struggles going to the gym, this is probably enough. I'd highly recommend this book for an easy understanding of the science behind habits and how it plays out in many different contexts.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was amazing. It showed just how much training and sacrifice our heroes go through on a daily basis to keep us safe. The description of events was incredible.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|The final film in Christopher Nolan's Batman vision, THE DARK KNIGHT RISES, is a worthy conclusion.<br /><br />Perhaps more than the Batman mythology I was fascinated by how current-day real-life themes made their way into this movie. The most prescient was that of the 99% vs. the 1%, Wall Street vs. Main Street, rich vs. the poor, embodied by Selina Kyle vs. Bruce Wayne/Batman and Bane's attack on the stock exchange.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway again stole the show, this time with her portrayal of Catwoman (though that name is never used in the film), and Nolan decided to go back to her roots as a \\"cat-burglar\\" for his rendition of the character.<br /><br />Bane, totally mangled in BATMAN AND ROBIN, this time is believable, terrifying, and the perfect villain. The sequence that leads to and includes his and Batman's first fight was thrilling; easily the best fight in all three films.<br /><br />Another real-life theme is that of the search for a clean, realistic, renewable energy source in order to sustain life with the obvious paradox being that such an energy source can also lead to great destruction. On this end, the finale to the film requires a suspension of disbelief (maybe beyond all belief) and may have been drawn out about a half hour-plus too long.<br /><br />As is invevitable in such an epic as Batman (especially with Nolan's final two installments earnings over $1 billion in box office receipts worldwide) we movie fans are going to rate it among the all-time great trilogies. As I think about some the classic conclusions--RETURN OF THE JEDI, RETURN OF THE KING, THE GODFATHER: PART III, ALIEN III, THE LAST CRUSADE, BACK TO THE FUTURE: PART III and MATRIX: REVOLUTIONS, among others--I put it well ahead of Revolutions, Back to the Future III, and Alien III, but not quite as satisfying as Jedi, Godfather, Crusade, or LOTR.<br /><br />Which begs the question as to why I'd give it 5-stars if it didn't quite meet the all-time great conclusions. And I suppose the answer is that I thought the character arc ended as I would have desired for Bruce Wayne/Batman (with the hint of a successor); the villains (Bane and Catwoman) were potrayed uniquely and interwoven with real-life themes in a very believable and disturbing way; the special-effects were top notch; and Hans Zimmer did his usual outstanding work as composer.<br /><br />The bottom line is that if you are prepared for a movie that goes on a touch too long (by about thirty minutes or so) but includes top-notch special effects, music, acting, and storyline within the Batman mythology, this is a must-own movie in your library.nswer is that I thought the character arc ended as I would have desired for Bruce Wayne/Batman (with the hint of a successor); the villains (Bane and Catwoman) were potrayed uniquely and interwoven with real-life themes in a very believable and disturbing way; the special-effects were top notch; and Hans Zimmer did his usual outstanding work as composer.<br /><br />The bottom line is that if you are prepared for a movie that goes on a touch too long (by about thirty minutes or so) but includes top-notch special effects, music, acting, and storyline within the Batman mythology, this is a must-own movie in your library.

The actual book...which they have to print, bind, assemble, create a cover image and book jacket, and ship is only $1 more...that is unacceptable!

B007SSEBCU|5.0|At first, I was hesitant to watch a movie about Margaret Thatcher. I mean, I lived through her rule of Great Britain, and I never saw eye to eye with her political ideology. But the fact that Meryl Streep was playing her and she won an Oscar for her role convinced me to rent the movie. The movie is astounding, brilliant, thought-provoking, and a true tribute to the real person Margaret Thatcher was, not the person we saw in the media. Do yourself a favor and rent or buy this film. Meryl Streep is truly the greatest actor of the 21st century.

0062197258|2.0|Based on the high average rating and the numerous positive reviews for this book - including a recommendation from a family member - I read \\"Into The Darkest Corner\\" over the weekend. On a side note, I had just finished reading all three Gillian Flynn novels, so my expectations may also have been higher in the \\"suspense\\" category.<br /><br />For starters, I'm not a prude, but I do expect my authors to know how to pull off the use of profanity in a book. In this book, it's just oo much. It has frequent, needless profanity, whether in conversation or just normal prose. It was somewhat jarring, and any good editor worth half their salt would have instructed the author to dial it back a notch (or two. or three.).<br /><br />The story switches back and forth between events of 4-years-prior and events of \\"current-day\\" (2007-8). In many cases, it does so effectively, even occasionally paralleling today situations against \\"then\\" situations for a comparison. In many others, the current-day chapter is merely \\"filler\\" - nothing occurring other than the main character checking the locks again or having a panic attack again. It is well, well-established that the character is OCD and that she has panic attacks. These chapters with nothing but that do not serve to develop or advance the story at all. Instead, it seems the author just wants to get back to a flashback chapter, but has to keep up with her standard every-other-chapter approach. Again, this is something that a good editor should have caught.<br /><br />The main character's present-day form is somewhat inconsistent - she is so well-described as a scared, mentally ill/struggling woman that it's hard to believe she even functions enough to go to work, go for a run, etc. She certainly doesn't seem to come across remotely social enough for any complete stranger (like her neighbor's work colleague) to go so far as to think she's charming upon first meeting.<br /><br />In the end, the story comes wrapped up in a giant, shinyand oh-so-predictable bow, just what anyone who has seen \\"Enough\\" or \\"Sleeping With the Enemy\\" or pretty much any movie on Lifetime Movie Network would expect. For a book that was trying to keep me on the edge of my seat, that ending was just too pat. The book is satisfactory for a quick weekend read, but I suspect once the hooplah dies down people will realize it's just a run-of-the-mill suspense/thriller book. Nothing to write home about.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I salute the Navy Seals and the writer who chose to tell the truth of how Bin Ladin was taken and the measures of the bravery of the men who undertook the training and courage to do what needed to be done! God bless you, Sir! for writing a true account of what everyone should know and not what the media wished to tell us. This is a book for all older School students to read and know what was done for our country and the truth about who did it!
B009329ZF2|2.0|Battleship is a thoroughly enjoyable movie. It is true entertainment. Don't look for any depth in the plot or characters; don't have any expectations that this movie will have a profound affect on your philosophies of life!  The action is fast and the machines are impressive - if you like Transformers!  If you are looking for a Good Friday or Saturday night movie that you don't have to put a lot of thought or emotion into, but that will keep your attention, this is it.
1878424319|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I think it is a very simple but great reminder of the basics. I will pass it on to others.
0143119680|4.0|If I find myself carrying a book around and reading it at any and every available moment, the book has passed the test.  With A Discovery of Witches, I purposefully would arrive early at a meeting just so I could sit in the car and read.<br /><br />I won't waste time trying to sound uber intelligent about this book.  I will say that this story was amazingly well thought out.  The author's historical references have baited me to research the actual places and events - not something I usually do after reading a novel.  I will also say that the dialogue between the characters kept me turning the pages.  Each character was so different, I loved them all.  The settings were amazing, first Oxford, then France and finally in a continental US house (that's alive and haunted) with witches.  It's a monster of a book, definitely not a quick read, but so worth the time and investment.<br /><br />If you are hesitant to buy the book, don't be.  It's worth the time and money and you will really enjoy it.  I'm such a picky reader and this book definitely passed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I finally jumped on the band-wagon and purchased the Hunger Games. I first watched the movie and felt like I wanted more than I got from the film, so I turned to the book. It was wonderful! I read it in just a couple of days. I am waiting for the second film to come out so I can watch it and then read the second book. If I watch the movie first, I'm never let down :-)Looking forward to reading all three books soon!!

0307346617|2.0|This book is not terrible and seems to have a lot of potential. However, I lost interest a little more than half way through because of the writing style and lack of plot to bring all the short stories (interviews) together. I didn't mind the short stories initially, but it just wasn't able to keep my attention for an entire book.
0385344333|4.0|I have read some of reviews of A Wanted Man and I disagree with most of them. Yes the plot developed slowly but that held my interest because I kept trying to figure out what was going on. You don't get any real insight about the mystery until the final pages of the book. Jack Reacher is hitchhiking his way to Chicago when he gets a ride rural Kansas. Three people are in the car, two men who obviously know each other and a very nervous woman who supposedly knows them. Yes they spend a lot of time in the car but Reacher has already sensed that something is not right. The reader knows that the people in the car were involved in a murder the why of the killing is a long time coming in the meantime there is a second murder. It's very fascinating to see Reacher making deductions using his remarkable ability with numbers to solve the mystery. I won't say anymore about the plot except to say that yes there are some dead ends and twists and turns but that makes it more interesting especially with the CIA( which is not supposed to operate within the USA) and the FBI  involved. The only real action comes at the very end but it's not until the very end that we learn who the bad guys are.

0756913675|5.0|A \\"Walk To Remember\\" is the best book ever written in my opinion.:) It's a touching love story with very sad twist. If you have a specical girl or boy in your life this book make you happy,sad,and mad at the same time.This book has a specical meaning;you never know how much time you have to spend with the person you love. A must read!!!<br /><br />Disclaimer (A Walk To Remember will probaly make you cry many times.)
B007N8RULO|5.0|I really like this version of Spider Solitaire!  I like that all you have to do it tap the card and it goes where you want it (majority of the time) but it's definitely not a biggie.  I enjoy passing the time playing this game and what can I say...winning.

B005LAIIPS|5.0|This movie had a lot of action so I understand that some people got confused and didn't know what was happening. I was a little confused at the beginning because I didn't know if this was the new Bourne, an enemy, a friend, etc. If you don't get it, you'll probably get it at the end. Good luck!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I could not put this book down. It was horrible what happened to her, but good things did come from it. The JAYC Foundation is wonderful. A must-read and that is why I gave it five stars.
B00746O3X8|4.0|Product itself works well.  But it was delivered without the small screw in attachments that are used to attach the camera to the harness.  Had to call Opteka and have them ship them to me.  There was no charge, just a hassle as the harness was useless without the attachments.  Harness works great now.
B00683JK9K|2.0|I have the free download of Magic Puzzle and it works better than the one I paid for! The Free app- the puzzle pieces move to where you want and you can pause in the middle of the puzzle and it will pull up where ever you left it, with the bought version the pieces are hard to move and  if you place a piece where it should go- sometimes it will not lock where it suppose to go- it gets old fast. The very 1st time that I used this new app, I had a message pop up that said something about the program being terminated and you don't get a choice so it closes your puzzle and I was in the middle of a large puzzle and it didn't save - it was gone. At first I thought it was just this one picture that I really wanted to finish (it closed out 3 times and never saved!!!) but then I tried another picture and it happened to that one also. So I am not impressed and would have a hard time paying for another magic puzzle!!!
B004EPZ034|3.0|My four year old actually saw this at his cousins' house and then continuously requested to see it at home.  So I bought it on Amazon and it is pretty cute.  Full of witty humor to keep parents from slipping into \\"kiddie tv\\" comas.  It's sweet and innocent and shouldn't offend most conservative families, though it does have a gambling scene on a cruise and a girl dance-off scene that are both a little odd, but in my estimation harmless enough.  Overall, it was funny, entertaining and presented a good message.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|Another saga from a great writer....her books are among the best reads!  Sometimes it takes awhile to figure  out  all the characters but in the long run....it is worth it.

0881035416|5.0|Wow! I remember reading Anne Frank in high school, but never really got into it! It always seems as though any book that you have to read in your high school English class, is not any book that you should be reading \\"just for fun\\". Glad I did! This is not the same Anne I met almost 7 years ago in my English class. No. This Anne was much more mature, she had a smitten personality and all the attitude to go along with it! Reminds me of myself when I was in HS! The Anne I read about in high school was boring, and made me fall asleep! The Anne I know now is full of life, hope, and faith-which is something that we could all benefit from in these time. It's truly sad how everything goes down, but I'm very thankful for this book, and will pass it down to my own daughters and nieces in the future!

B002DQDV6Y|4.0|So i have to say, this is one of the rare times that I liked the movie better than the book.  That's not to say the book isn't good, they're all pretty fantastic, but I've never cared for the second as much as I have some of the other ones.  And speaking of second, if you haven't read the first book or watched the first movie what on earth are you doing reading this?  Go check those out!<br /><br />The Chamber of Secrets explores Harry's second year at Hogwarts.  Rescued from his muggle aunt and uncle by Ron and his brothers, he heads to Ron's house to await the start of the term.  But things keep going from bad to worse and when he can't get to the train, he and Ron decide to take a magical car to Hogwarts, with mixed results.  From there other strange things begin happening at Hogwarts and it's hurting the students, especially the Muggle born ones.  Harry and Co. can't help but get mixed into the problem and adventures abound!<br /><br />Characters:<br />Daniel Radcliffe:  Harry Potter<br />Rupert Grint: Ron Weasley<br />Emma Watson: Hermione Granger<br />Kenneth Branagh: Gilderoy Lockhart<br />Robbie Coltrane: Rubeus Hagrid<br />Richard Harris: Albus Dumbledore<br />Jason Isaacs: Lucius Malfoy<br />Alan Rickman: Severus Snape<br />Tom Felton: Draco Malfoy<br /><br />As usual I thought the cast did a superb job.  Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson make a great team and have wonderful camaraderie on the set.  Each plays their part exactly as you envision from the book.  Branagh was ok, I guess I just pictured something different for Lockhart and while he does pull of the smarmy self-centered aspect well, there was just something there missing for me.  The same with Harris, I really wish Dumbledore would play a larger role in these movies, but his screentime seems to be limited.  All of the supporting cast were pretty good though and I can't think of any I'd wish to replace with someone else.  They certainly bring the wizards and witches of Harry Potter to life.<br /><br />The plot was pretty well paced.  As said before I liked the movie better than the book for this one (not by much, but a little) and even though it followed the book pretty well, this one just seemed to be more exciting.  Especially the action scenes, not to spoil too much, but I'm not a big fan of spiders and definitely got creeped out by the ones in this movie.  There were a couple things from the book that I wish had been included, but I understand the limitation of time and that they can't fit everything in there.  I also liked that they paid attention to the detail of the books down to the moving pictures and foods in the movie.<br /><br />The cinematography was excellent, as usual.  I like how they incorporate magic and even the Quidditch looks real.  Makes you want to grab a broomstick and jump off your balcony (just kidding of course!).  It's amazing what they were able to do considering how much of the movie had to be generated and yet it still looks life like.  The music too is wonderful, and the instrumentals that accompany every Harry Potter movie are chilling yet exciting at the same time.  I don't think it would be a worthwhile movie without the music actually.  It's just as big of a part as the plot is.<br /><br />Great movie, great series.  Can't wait to watch the next!<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012/>The plot was pretty well paced.  As said before I liked the movie better than the book for this one (not by much, but a little) and even though it followed the book pretty well, this one just seemed to be more exciting.  Especially the action scenes, not to spoil too much, but I'm not a big fan of spiders and definitely got creeped out by the ones in this movie.  There were a couple things from the book that I wish had been included, but I understand the limitation of time and that they can't fit everything in there.  I also liked that they paid attention to the detail of the books down to the moving pictures and foods in the movie.<br /><br />The cinematography was excellent, as usual.  I like how they incorporate magic and even the Quidditch looks real.  Makes you want to grab a broomstick and jump off your balcony (just kidding of course!).  It's amazing what they were able to do considering how much of the movie had to be generated and yet it still looks life like.  The music too is wonderful, and the instrumentals that accompany every Harry Potter movie are chilling yet exciting at the same time.  I don't think it would be a worthwhile movie without the music actually.  It's just as big of a part as the plot is.<br /><br />Great movie, great series.  Can't wait to watch the next!<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012
B001MUSQ80|5.0|Had to buy this for an American Literature class and I am so glad that I did.  This was a great read and my first introduction to Carson McCullers.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was so thrilling! Couldn't put it down. Once I finished it I had to purchase the other two books so I could see how it all ends. Definitely $ well spent! You won't be dissapointed!!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I love spiderman he is my FAVORITE superhero of all time and j have been looking for a spiderman game where you. can shoot webs and swing... is that possible in this app?
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app...... it is very helpful. It allows me to know when my battery is charging and sends me notifications when if is about to die. Also lets me know when I last charged and how much time I have left to listen to msic before ut dies. I recommend it!
B0094KF4WG|4.0|I have know way of really confirming if this chap was on the mission or not, however it is quite believable and well written.
B009329Y30|5.0|Basically, romance stories have the same background too them. Characters change, story lines and scenery. On this movie, I really liked it. I thought the actors had chemistry. Because of the Brother's story line it drew you in more, you wanted to find out along with the sister what really happened. Was the ex going to be able to control the family or was the drifter going to help them. I really love the actress who plays the mother. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves romance novels/movies. The drifter is from the show High school Musical. I always said he would be a really good looking actor. And I think this movie is showing that he can do more then just sing.
B002ZG999U|4.0|It was fun, enjoyable and uplifting to see a bunch of old hunks still willing to give it another try. The dialogue was delightful. The action thrilling. I left the movie wanting to see more--much more. My hat's off to all the old hunks who are still willing to give it another try.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I douns rhw book No Easy Day bery compelling. I am a female and in general I would find books about Navy SEALS pretty boring. This author, however, was able to gain my attention and keep me interested by speaking in generalities in the most part with some facts about his personal llife mixed in.<br /><br />I am extremely pround of our military men and I think this book is a tribute to them and provides a small window through which to visualize a small part of what they endure so that the rest of us can live in peace.
1400079144|5.0|This is a non stop can't put down until you finish kind of book. All kinds of twists and turns and surprises. The kind of book that keeps you interested. As soon as you think you know what is going to happen this book proves you wrong. If you liked The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons you will LOVE this book. It is the best of the trilogy. I am convinced it is Dan Brown's best work yet. I am really hoping it becomes a movie soon.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|The item was just as described. I absolutely LOVE this movie. If you haven't seen this Jane Austen story, you should....
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|app works great and my kids love it to help with schoolwork.  the kindle edition is the best.  I love it for my checkbook balancing too
B0090P98Z4|4.0|liked it.  great dungeon crawlers.  since its free that's better.  controls are a little touchy but cant complain when app is free.
159413586X|4.0|Loved the book, really wanted a paperback because I was travelling, but this truly is large print (some of the other sellers said theirs was not) and just as heavy as a hardcover.  Still a great read!
B005LAIHR2|5.0|This movie is freaking fun if you like some campiness mixed with your 80's music.  As one of the other reviewers states, the energy literally pulsates off the screen.  It was so fun, I saw it twice in the theater, and wish I'd gone a third time!  Tom does a great job as the aging Rock Star, and the music was fabulous.  Also liked Catherine  Zeta-Jones, Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand.  If you're looking for some fun, over-the-top escapism, this is your movie.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It is good to finally hear from a member of the armed forces first hand.  I could only imagine from watching the news and reading the paper what these fine men and women went through on a daily basis.  Reading \\"No Easy Day\\" puts into perspective the daily mental and physical strain our US service members must devote to secure our freedom.  GOD BLESS THE USA. Thank You.  Thank You.  Thank You.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|easy to play!! great for kids and adults too! would recommend for sure! super cute and fun! only takes a few minutes to start buying new stuff with the pts. earned so quickly
B006X5L6VS|4.0|I have the current version (1.2.1) which is supposed to include the Sky Information Pack, but when I run the app, it asks if I want to add the Sky Information Pack, and when I say yes, it wants me to pay for the Info Pack.  I already paid for The Night Sky app, why do I have to pay for s/t that is supposed to be included in it?
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I use evernote to maintain a research lab notebook (among other lists and recipes, etc.) and its awesome for that. The difficult nature of editing or making entries using my kindle fire on pre-formatted entries made with my Mac, however, prevents this from being 5 stars.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Great app!  Easy to use!!  Would definitely tell my friends about this app :) Thank you for making it simple!!
B0076XIS4O|5.0|Really, is there anything else that needs to be said? No, there isn't. the music is tranquil, chill, sweet. So very, very sweet.
B007MU85D0|5.0|At first, I only liked a few off the album, but after a few listens, I'm hooked to all of it. Grouplove and Foster the People are the only other two bands I can listen to the whole album and love it all. I found out that iTunes didn't download one of the songs, and after downloading it I loved that one as well. There's some true talent in this band. Check out some of their live performances, they sound just the same! Great band, and I'm excited for their future releases!
B0091THDOM|4.0|I NEVER buy a product that doesn't have a review. One of the great things about shopping Amazon is knowing what you're going to get. However, I needed an iPhone 5 case and there just wasn't a lot on the market yet. For such a cheap price I figured I could take the chance.<br /><br />The product itself is a great. The phone fits VERY \\"snug\\". The tab you pull on to get the phone out is magnetic and of good quality. It's actually kind of fun. I wouldn't count on using this as a wallet too though. The pocket for cards is super tight and goes all the way down to the bottom. Maybe a future release of this product will make the pocket shallower. Anyway, if you put cards in there you would probably have to take your phone out and dig in the pocket to retrieve them.<br /><br />There are small holes on the bottom for speakers but there isn't a hole for the ear phone jack. (The reason for the 4 stars) I decided to just put my phone in upside down and is basically the same thing. The leather is also of good quality and doesn't smell like chemicals at all. I would definitely recommend this.
B00338QENI|4.0|This true account highlights the disconnect between  medical researchers who are focused on finding causes and cures for diseases and the subjects who provide the raw materials or are exposed to deadly toxins/viruses/bateria in the name of the advancement of science.  The author goes to great lengths to tell the story of one woman's contribution to science, even though she never knew that her cells were used.  It is a thought provoking book.
B008602KQI|1.0|Its a horrible movie teaching children violence and killing is ok. My child won't watch it!  I don't recommend the movie to anyone.
0553801473|5.0|I just finished \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" and can't wait until \\"The Winds of Winter\\" is published.  (You can read one of its chapters on Martin's website.)  I will miss these characters for now, although their world has to be the cruelest, harshest world I've ever encountered in my reading experience, and I sure wouldn't want to live there.  I understand \\"Winter\\" won't be released for quite a while, but I'm very much looking forward to it.  I love these books, and so far am enjoying the HBO series.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games trilogy is fantastic! I ended up watching the movie with some friends, not expecting much, and I ended up throughly enjoying it, so I just had to read the books. I am very glad I did!<br /><br />I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say that near the end of book 2, Catching Fire, things really pick up.
B0087HT36U|4.0|as addicting as angry birds but more strategy involved.  lots of levels keep them coming. I really enjoy this game. hope more levels are around the corner.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I pre-ordered this dvd set and it came right on the day it was released. Also, I received a refund because it was released at a lower price. I received the dvd on tuesday and received my refund on thursday and I didn't have to do anything. I purchased this for my daughter for her birthday and she let me borrow it after she watched it. It's an awesome show. And yes, I did buy her something else with my refund.
B00785P2QC|5.0|good game to get when you want to pass time. kine of hard but keep working at it an it will get easier. wish the trucks would not brake down so much but once u buy the truculent shop it not so bad. enjoy the game
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really liked this book and how it was written.  The way the chapters were written kept me looking forward to the next one.  Not sure about the ending though.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I could not put this book down, it was so enjoyable to read.  Great story line and if you are a dog lover you will be in tears at different parts of the book but the ending is so different and it made me want to read more of the authors books.  I will say this has been one of my favorite books to read and enjoy.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book is very entertaining, and at times reminded me of my own relationship with my now husband when we first started dating.  It's a great beach read and didn't take me long to finish it once I started.  There were a few times I found myself wishing the author could have put some different phrases in and used different descriptions of a kiss. I am going to check out the other books Jamie McGuire has written because I liked this one so much.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|lots of fun.  addicted and have only played a few times.have watched others on their phones glad we have it now for kindles.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I personally have never played this type of game before and was hooked on it the moment I started playing! I'm desperate to collect all of the pieces to play the other games!
B008XG1X18|4.0|app for pinterest is so much easier then going on the website! love the way its organized however half the time it barely wants to load and I have to force close it. takes 3 tries on average before it finally loads! but hey its free and I love the site :)
1476712042|5.0|This book was amazing! As soon as I finished reading it I quickly began a second read of it. I absolutely could not put it down. I was consumed by the powerful chemistry of the characters. A powerful love story.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Loved the game, want the next one! lot of fun,  played it with my husband. We had a blast, really liked the riddle of it all.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|yes game is easy.  but very additive, like the chance to earn free coins. better then playing in real life
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love the game makes you think. glad it has several levels to work threw. easy for small children harder for older children and adults perfect for family
B0095T3H2U|3.0|This movie has a great cast and concept, but gets lost along the way and ends up very uneven. Jason Segal's chef plays opposite Emily Blunt's psychology doctorate student. Soon after they get engaged she is offered her dream spot in a doctorate program in Michigan, so he gives up his promising career as a chef in San Francisco to follow her there. The change leaves their relationship unbalanced, and they can never quite regain their footing, and commit to finally marrying. The movie traces their ups and downs, and the route they finally take to the alter.<br /><br />There's a lot of relationship truth in this movie, but not a lot of laughs. Some wacky scenes feel thrown in to try and bring the laugh factor up but end up feeling out of place - one in which Jason Segal's character is serving venison stew and home-made honey in deer hooves comes to mind. I found the chemistry between Segal and Blunt uneven also - at times it worked, but in other scenes they felt awkward with each other. I think their comedic strengths are different - hers is timing and a sharp tongue while his is more goofy. My favorite comedic scene of Blunt's was actually not with Segal but with co-star Alison Brie (Community, Mad Men), who plays her sister, in a scene where they are impersonating Elmo and Cookie Monster while having a relationship heart-to-heart.<br /><br />So this one had its moments, but overall felt a bit schizophrenic. 3-stars it is.
B0087HT36U|4.0|nice and fun game....I like it. I think is better than A- bird. takes time to finish those mini games.
B009CPEOC4|5.0|I like Katy Perry's music well enough, but certainly wouldn't consider myself a hardcore fan. My kids and I rented this movie at their request and I went in with low expectations. Surprisingly, I ended up thoroughly enjoying it. I felt it had the right balance of concert footage, behind the scenes footage, and backstory. Katy comes across as honest, real, and driven by a desire to truly make others smile. Her journey through the music industry was inspiring, and the concert footage was loads of fun. The bits on her failing marriage with Russell Brand was just enough to keep it real without indulging in any bashing. I feel the film is innocent enough for younger girls (mine are 8 and 6) but of course that's up to parents - there are a few swear words, and footage of 'I Kissed a Girl', but no wild partying or anything like that. Katy actually comes across as working more than anything else. Her idea of a good time is taking the crew to an amusement park on their day off. So mostly, this was good, clean fun.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Exciting and believable narrative.  A little scary that the protagonist seems obviously to enjoy his work. He also insinuates that his job of killing \\"enemies\\" shouldn't be restrained by political considerations, despite the fact that there seems to be no end of enemies.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The Millennium Trilogy was a fantastic series!  Each book left you wanting more.  The plot twists were great, and you were surprized over and over again.  Make sure you read them in order!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this Mp3 App. I listen to Rock & Roll 24/7. If you enjoy music the way I do, especially while working, then this is a must have Mp3 App. Try it out on a Kindle Fire. Awesome!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed the \\"on the edge of my chair\\" action.  It was simply written and is probably better enjoyed by the younger generation.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Almost better than Angry Birds, and more challenging.  I would like to see more Miniclip games, fun to play online as well.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was very interesting and kept me glued! I think it was well written. I wish they would continue with more books
B005SFR7YE|4.0|I saw the musical on Broadway twice, the 2004 movie 3 times and the 25th Anniversary on a 46' screen at the State Theatre.  This 25th anniversary edition has the strongest cast with beautiful singing by Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess, the best Phantom and Christine.  Hadley Fraser's singing was also good.  I did not particularly like his portrayal of Raoul.  Whereas other portrayals of Raoul all show a dandy and kind gentleman who is the complete opposite of the Phantom, Fraser's Raoul is domineering and frankly a jerk.  (Perhaps Fraser was creating a new Raoul to better fit the one in the sequel, Love Never Dies.)  I was not particularly impressed by the other cast members. The set is nicely done although I am not crazy about the highly pixelated projects that passed for some of the scenery.<br /><br />Having seen all three incarnations of Phantom of the Opera, your choice really depends on your preference.  If you prefer beautiful music, you cannot go wrong with this 25th anniversary edition.  If you prefer a more cohesive plot and beautiful scenery (not to mention a very sexy Phantom played by Gerard Butler), go for the 2004 movie.  If you prefer live, Broadway or the West End version would be your cup of tea.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I am so glad I came across this app! I have been looking into finding meditation techniques and this really goes along with what I'm looking to do! Thanks!
B008BM9L72|4.0|These are a good read really enjoyed the actual story in these books. Would read again although I found myself skipping over some of the more erotic bits by the 3rd book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellent love story, so addictive!!<br />I loved the way it's written, the details, the way the protagonist feels. I actually identify myself with her.<br />I strongly recommend it.
0743454537|4.0|Jodi Picoult is an amazing author, and one of my favorite. I've read several of her books, and after hearing so much hype about this book, I knew it would be a good novel to read for my college English class. This story is a very conversational one. After a couple finds out their child have a rare form of leukemia, they decide that there only chance in helping her survive is if they create another child in the lab that is a perfect match to help donate blood, bone marrow, and even a kidney to their sick child. When I began to read this novel, I was instantly reminded of the author Lurlene McDaniel, who writes books that often have main characters suffering from life threatening illness'. This entire novel is told in different perspectives, allowing the reader to understand the thoughts and feelings of each character. Though this novel is sad, it really shows the tough decisions one must make when deciding right from wrong. This novel is an easy and enjoyable read with some heart wrenching scenes as well. I've known several people to endure chemotherapy and radiation, so when Jodi Picoult described scenes with the sister is undergoing treatment, it really grabbed my heart. I personally feel that the layout of the novel, presenting each chapter with a view from a different character, helps keep the novel interesting. I have yet to watch the movie, but will be interested in seeing how the actors portrayed such strong characters.
0345529057|5.0|This is an engrossing and fabulous series!  You can read ahead(books 3 & 4) before Season 3 \\"Game of Thrones\\" on HBO.
B001PU8N0I|4.0|Aahh, is there any better way to escape the realities of life than a couch, a purring cat, and a gorgeously-filmed love story?  Make it a tale of plenty and poverty, longing and loathing, and self-control and social graces in a place where you'd have every excuse to display neither of those and you've got the delicious treat of a film called \\"Little Dorrit.  From the first time I watched this BBC version of the Charles Dickens story, I knew I was going to eventually own it.  Even though Dickens can be a bit darker than, say, Jane Austen, his stories contain enough humor in some of his odd-ball characters that it keeps the movie from being in the least grim.  I loved the acting (who could go wrong with Matthew MacFadyen?), the costuming, and the superb production qualities.  I'm completely smitten with this movie and I'm sure I'll watch it many times again.  I gave the rating a 4-star instead of a 5 only because the last disc in the set had several places where it hesitated, as if it were going to get stuck, although it didn't.  Slightly annoying, but by the time you get this far in the story, a technical glitch or two isn't nearly enough to pull you out of your Dickensian dreamland.  If buggies and bonnets carry you away as they do me, I'd buy this one.  It's addicting.
B000063Y8F|5.0|Excellent machine! We used it the first time and there was no complaint at all about HER garlic press.<br />We've finally found the one that works every time. We highly recommend the Rosle Garlic Press.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I find this to be a very functional and beneficial overall. I do wish however, that the developer would be a little more active with updates in response to request and criticisms.
B0087HT36U|4.0|I love this game I get stuck playing it for hours. its a lot of fun. def worth adding to any device
B00881VLCE|4.0|Love this game, I just wish there were more pictures for free.  Also if you are gone from your puzzle for too long, the game stops working and you have to start over.
B004U8VUUC|4.0|This movie was super interesting.  It's one of those movies that leaves you feeling unsettled, but it's still a really good watch.  I'd definitely recommend it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Having read many books on this topic (and seen the movies as well),  I was delighted to read this series. The plot is well developed, and the overall premise is quite chilling.  One of THE best books, period, I`ve read in a very long time.
B004NOCCEG|5.0|The average citizen has no idea what is happening \\"behind the doors\\" of our financial system. We want to blame a certain president, but in reality we need to look at the whole structure of how money has been manipulated. Our economy is collapsing thanks to some skilled personalities mastering devious manipulations of the financial world. \\"Inside job\\" helps us a great deal to understand the \\"mess\\" our economy is in.
B001SKB1Y0|5.0|I love this movie. I definitely want to go to Barcelona. And I am extremely satisfied with the quality of Amazon instant video. It is amazing.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I didn't know what this app was about the first time I heard it, but then I downloaded it recently and I'm just hella in love right now. Works great if you're a kindleer.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Okay these books were boring within the first 3 chapters. How many different ways can you describe sex, kinky or not? Apparently not that many. Very thin plot with way too much sex that became boring. There I said it. I am sure this is herecy to the fan community but I had to get it out there.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great plot with an unusual twist.  one of the best mysteries I have ever read ! The characters were so real and i loved all the references to life in the midwest, having grown up there.  if you love a complex story plot  this is the book for you.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Loved the animation in this movie. The kids love it! It shows how someone with a cold heart can come around and have some compassion.
0670451495|5.0|Very nice hard cover edition. The book was in perfect condition. Have ordered this book before and recipients always enjoy it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|If you loved the first season you will love this one. Downton Abbey is a wonderful period piece. I can't wait to see season 3!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Very disappointing. Predictable story line over use of some verbiage and phrases.  Not as sexy/hot as the hype had indicated.  Did read trilogy but it certainly did not hold my Interest.  Just wanted it to end.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Works very.well keeps me informed on the life of Battery. As well as all the time I have left for other things on my fire.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|This movie was truly great. Like Mission to Mars.. it was a victim of politics. Watch, and be filled with hope and wonder.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was an excellent book.  I read all three of the trilogy.  I woke up reading these book, and couldn't not put it down at night because I wanted more and more.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Under appreciated and under recognized, shake the hand of a soldier today and thank them. And if they're homo, say \\"nice purse\\"!
B003RNXIBK|5.0|If anyone ever asks why you like Eminem, what detroit and midwest rap is about, or how hip-hop can be spiritual: show them this album.<br /><br />Recovery shows everything rap is and can be in a brutally unapologetic way.  Love the Way You Lie showcases the struggle of madness in an abusive relationship from someone trying with everything they have not to be evil - and failing.  Going Through Changes reveals the horrible moment when you realize that suicide is a mistake.  Not Afraid lays out the path to recovery from the starting point of unconquerable self-confidence.  Cinderella Man rejoices in the power of music to fully realize the imagined self.<br /><br />It is a deeply emotional story that will cut you if you connect with it, and heal you if put yourself in Em's shoes.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|A short book, but it was good. thank god it was free or else i wouldn‘t of gotten it . bye
B008D28HYS|2.0|Not appealing... to me at least.  Too little to keep my interest.  Boring puzzles. Uninstalled after a day due to no interest.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I love the pirates movies and now having the soundtrack is amazing! No scratches, it wasn't even opened. Thank YOU!

B001A5HBJC|5.0|Finally sat down to watch Mad Men from the beginning.  Now I know what all the buzz has been about.  It really is deliciously done and transports one back to another era very convincingly.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|not bad  addictive  easy to navigate and control wworks great on my kindle fire and keptnme playing without having to spend money
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Really like this game. Each level can be played many times without being repetitious. For some of us, it's a good exercise for the powers of observation, concentration and reflexes.
B0053TMP24|5.0|I love this book. i can‘t wait to read the next one. i love the percy jackson series as well and i hope they continue with this series
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|I enjoyed watching Puss in boots! It was funny, the story in my opinion was good, and the movie itself looks good and sounds great. Puss in boots is not all childish so even adults can enjoy.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|This is a great family movie. It moves fast enogh to keep children's interest.  Adults will enjoy the movie also. It's sci-fi. It's has a romance. It's has action.  It's animated. It also has drama.
1476712042|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!I did not want it to end, i wish she would think about doing a second book!The characters capture you from the beginning!! I have read quite a few books and this is on my top 3!! Im not going to type about what the book is about im just going to tell you to Freaking buy it and read it! :)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book because of the hype, and wanted an easy entertaining read.  It was not entertaining, the writing is at an 8th grade level, and the subject matter was terrible.  Don't be curious to see if this book would work for you.....just move onto another recommendation.
B0015AARJI|4.0|Kids still have it and its working long after the purchase. Item shipped fairly fast. Cant get these anywhere else for the price.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers of Catan is one of my favorite board games of all time! Sadly, I don't have a lot of friends that play board games, so when I do find someone to play, I am ecstatic! The designer must be a rock star in Germany because this game is very addicting and requires some strategy on your part. It get's pretty funny when people start trying to negotiate trading resources in order to move forward in the game. I cannot say enough to praise this game! Even if you have to bribe your friends with drinks, you should definitely try to introduce this game to them if you haven't played this game yet.
B007RI56NY|5.0|This album does not disappoint.  Some different sounds from them, but holds true to their quality.  Good for old and new fans alike.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this app multiple times a day for a while now and it works perfectly ... Would recommend  to anybody looking for a great weather app.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I loved the sixth season of Dexter. It introduced many new characters and to Dexter to knew highs and lows with his dark passenger. Dexter is such a guilty pleasure of mine. I even got my husband hooked this season.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Just looking at it is wow the interface looks bad if you are looking for a Bible app get olivetree!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It had lots of action and always kept me guessing what was going to happen next.  Wish there would be a follow up book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Better download all 3 books at the start because you are not going to want to wait for the next one....
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Great depiction of the effort required to walk the Pacific Coast Trail (PCT). The author brought the trail to life with her descriptions of the beauty and the danger of being out in the wilderness. She also did a good job of weaving her past into the experience and describing how the hike helps her deal with her past. She showed how it is possible to use an experience to grow personally and deal with some demons from the past.<br />Very enjoyable plus a lot of fun to read her description of some of the areas I have visited (as a native Oregonian).
B004BC7MRM|5.0|Kid Rock's Born Free album is all that you would expect from him.  Great performances from a generous, energetic artist.  Can't stop playing it.
B0087HT36U|5.0|There are many challenging levels.  Graphics are good, gameplay is fun for various aged players.  Recommend this game for all.
0545165067|5.0|I don't normally read this genre or teen fiction; however this was great. I cared about the characters and where they were going enough to want to read the sequels... Awesome book...
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is a Christmas gift.  The package arrived promptly and in good condition.  This will be a present most appreciated by the person receiving it.  She and I adore the show!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|One of the best I've read in a long time. Buy it now and read it. It's a great book and an unbelievable deal. Growing up, I remember those commercials where a drug dealer would give free drugs to kids at school to get them hooked. Unfortunately, that never happened to me and I lost out on the chance to become a junkie. This the closest i've come to that. Anthony Ryan is that drug dealer. When he charges $50 a page for book two check the local pawn shops for your missing heirlooms. That is all
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Peccato non riuscire ad usarlo fuori dalla rete wifi. Per il resto un vero fuoriclasse. Ma l'audio sul dispositivo come si ripristina?
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|'The Hunger Games' was very well done and true to the book. The book was better as it always is for me, but this movie was almost as good!!
0767802470|1.0|I don't know what was wrong with the product, but it was faulty. About half way through it it stopped playing with giant pixels on the screen. I was not happy.
B0087HT36U|5.0|very fun game. great way for killing time or working the mind. no freezes on my droidx or xoom fe tablet.
B00571F26Y|3.0|Interesting, but rather heavy going.  If it helps remove my flab-it's a six star,excellent read.<br />(the proof will be in the thinning). Watch this space!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I've not really ever been a big fan of Stephen King but for some reason, this title caught my eye so I downloaded the free sample to my tablet and was immediately hooked.  Ended up buying the full version and wasn't at all disappointed.  I found it to be very suspenseful and had difficulty putting it down at times which is unusual for me as I don't consider myself an \\"avid reader\\".<br />Yes, it is fiction, but it puts a very interesting twist on an historical event and I enjoyed every bit of it.<br /><br />David
B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|I bought the 100 pack of all games in this because it was all only 10$ now even if do uninstall it (I did it once) all of your games are still bought and no data was erased the controls can be different for almost each game just like in the old times but it is still almost like the ones of the past if you like aracades then you should get this with 10$ for all games
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Starts a bit slow at first but it picks up later on, great book and the attention to detail was amazing, you wont regret this purchase
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I was unsure this would be any fun but it is actually rather addicting! I can see myself wasting hours at this!
B002DQDV6Y|4.0|The movie was excellent, there's no denying that. However, I really wish there were subtitles! For us muggle folk, sometimes our ears don't work too well. Not to mention there's a load of new language with respect to places, spells, and unusual names. Seriously though, subtitles are amazing and you ought to have them.
0375507256|2.0|Was attracted to this by the lushly filmed movie trailer with big-name actors and the Wachowskis in the director seat.  It's certainly an ambitious project, but possibly better suited to film* than print.<br /><br />I'm glad I read this on my tablet because without the search button it would have been pretty difficult to track back all the characters who become central to the six plots but who were introduced to us offhandedly multiple stories and tone-shifts ago.<br /><br />For this reason, as well as the runaway stream-of-conscious narrative that characterizes all six of the perspectives in this novel and crowds out the advancement of plot, one would expect a greater payoff in the form of piercing insight.  This is absent.  We're treated to the same old rehashing of grand human themes of slavery and power and environmental protection and greed, etc - except they're given the same emphasis as the other petty lines of thought that the characters embark upon.  So in the end we feel a bit underwhelmed.<br /><br />Even the book's signature device - embedding the prior story into the existing sequence of events - does very little to actually affect the current plotline, which makes one wonder why we are bothering to endure all these tone shifts.  The fact that the Journal of Patrick Ewing *exists* in Frobisher's world, which shares a character in Luisa del Rey's story, etc. should mean something other than being offhandedly referred to.  Perhaps I've been spoiled by Inception's expert integration of all the levels of consciousness - but this plot device could be great and it just doesn't do anything accessible to me.<br /><br />Bottom line - the author has done much to lower my expectations for the film.<br /><br />*The movie production almost certainly will quiet down all that irrelevant interior monologue and pointless accent-shifting that was entertaining at first, than mildly vexing, than infuriating when dosed six times.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|really enjoyed this game. cant wait for part two. was wondering where everyone from the church went after they were released from their trance though.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|This movie begins when James T. Kirk is still in the womb.  His father is about to perish while saving James' mother from certain death.  The movie shows how he becomes a starship captain.  It is very entertaining and the plot actually makes some sense.  It is worth watching, even if you are not a \\"Trekkie\\".
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book. I think it was my favorite of the whole series. And it's priced very reasonable! Its a must read!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|awesome game reminds me of day of ole wish it was real though. but all in all a good game
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game was okay. I wouldn't really recommend.<br />but if you are in the car for a couple of hours and there is nothi'n else to then the game is not that bad.<br />I am only writing this though to get more points.
B001W2I9Y4|5.0|I didn't want to believe all the hype because I had seen Mastodon open up for Clutch a few times before this album and I was not into all the death metal screaming and riffs that were so fast and complex that they just fly right over your head like jet airplane noise. But they changed their sound a little, they sing, they throw in some really nice melodies and some wild jazzy stuff too, and they kept their metal edge. It's heavy, it's smart, and it has an atmospheric quality akin to Pink Floyd. Now if they could just remove some of those awful tattoos I could introduce them to my parents.
B000HIVOI2|5.0|I don't know why, but this movie seems to be a forgotten classic of the 90's. It's a wonderful piece of sci-fi/action with a great twist on Egyptian mythology. And the TV show is spawned also turned out to be a classic. This movie looks pretty great on blu ray, though I thought it might look better.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Well written and hard to put down.  The ending left me wanting more so I bought the next book, Catching Fire, and began reading it straight away.
B0001BKAEY|2.0|I bought this movie so I would have the complete set. Apparently, my OCD was greater than my desire to keep my money. Of course, I still bought the blu ray set when I came out. Though, at least I could say I did for the few good parts of this franchise and for how great it looked on blu ray. Looking back on it, I have no good excuse for this movie.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Perfect condition, super cheap when I got it, and everything is great! I'm halfway through the series now and it's bringing back so many good memories! Thank you so much!
B000BCKFWK|5.0|This movie blew me away in the theaters and I had to own it as soon as a special edition was released. And I loved this edition until the blu ray version came out, because, let's face it, it's looks a helluva lot better on blu ray. But this set did come with some fun goodies that the blu ray didn't. So if you want some fun extras to go along with a great movie, pick up this set.
0385344228|5.0|On the list of the best books that I have ever read. It gets your interest from the first page. I found myself going back and forth on my opinion on what I thought of the characters. Just when you think you know what is going to happen, a ball comes out of left field. I had to read the last chapter twice to make sure I was correct about what I had just read. Twists that you can't imagine. Brillant.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|this was a really intriguing game.  the soundtrack for it was really nice. I would recommend this to any one who like a challenge. I got this when it was free, but I would pay to get this as well!!!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this app. I don't lose any pieces. I can even do the puzzles with my kids. I really like how you can start a puzzle and go back to it when ever I want. I rate this at a five!
0143038419|3.0|The book is divided equally into thirds:  1/3 is eating in Italy; 1/3 is praying in India; 1/3 is loving in Indonesia.  The first third was my favorite by far! I love the kinds of books that involve travel and are also a recipe-logue.  I delude myself that I might walk in these same footsteps and have the same culinary adventures.  I take notes about the foods to eat and the best places to visit.  Oh, to live vicariously through another!<br /><br />And, then I stopped living vicariously.  The second third of the book was an absolute drudge.  I do consider myself a spiritual person and I do believe in the power of meditation but way too much time was spent on this and, as a reader, I didn't get anything out of it.<br /><br />The last third of the book was an improvement.  Although it is only in the last third that the author mention 'love', this is really the underlying theme of the whole story.  The entire book was the author's journey through a bad divorce and debilitating rebound romance so finding that love awaited her at the end was a nice closure.<br /><br />It's really hard to picture this as a movie and really, I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.  I did like it overall, but I'm not getting the build-up and hype.
B00932A2MC|1.0|I won't waste any time in saying that this idiotic film is the worst film I've see this year.  A total waste of time, money and talent. SHAME Universal for giving the green light to this drivle.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Excellent show with well developed characters. Makes the point that making guns illegal will not stop illegal gun trafficing. Also shows the dark and necessary side of many motorcycle clubs. Deglamorizes outlaw behavior.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|evermore os the most handy, stylish, quickest,  and awesome notebook app I've ever had. I love the way it organizes my notes and notebooks and how easy it is to save my good ideas and random thoughts with only a few simple steps. well done Evernote!!
B005EGXTEE|5.0|This series is just the best!!! It makes you think about what could happen in the future - scary!! But its easy reading and very entertaining.
1600597963|5.0|This book is unreal...has just about everything you want to know about beading around cabs. I thought her first one was good and this one even better...
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Book one of Fifty Shades of Gray held my interest, so I decided to buy book two.  I just cannot get into book 2 like I did the first one. I am really disappointed.  I will have to finish book 2 to see if I want to continue to the last book.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|If you can get past the very first episode of this series (from Season 1), you will be hooked!  The writing and acting just gets better with each season and season 2 is amazing!  The picture and sound on this BD set is amazing!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This was an outstanding movie that outlined the Global Financial Crisis and how the goverment, banking industry and the FED robbed Americans and the world from \\"inside\\"! I would recommend that all Americans who are interested in their finances and our financial system, watch this very disturbing movie! Matt Damon and the producers did an outstanding job summarizing the \\"Inside Job\\" that took place against America and the world financial market(s)! Great movie!!!!!!!!!!
B001MSMULG|3.0|A bit anti-climatic. I Did not care for the last two chapters as it felt like the author was just throwing something together to finish the book.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Great characters, excellent writing!!  This show is one of the best on cable TV by far. I am completely addicted!!
B002JWD6AS|5.0|This book was great. Yay yay yay yay yay yay! yay yay yay yay yay yay yay yay yay yay!!
B008ETOSYI|5.0|I bought it not knowing much about it but im glad I did!  It was a great story. Will watch again.
0553386794|5.0|This book is the first of the Game of Thrones series.  Execellent reading.  I had to replace this book to a friend as I destroyed his.  I received this in execellent condition.  I would recommend it to any and everyone.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i dint really like gambling but i love this and its free cant beat that. i van see it getting addictive
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Wonderful book -- I have read and re-read it so many times and fall in love with it all over again each time!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Well written, skipped out on a lot of the intial SEAL training (I've read all that stuff before), got right into the mission aspects and stayed focussed throughout the book. I didn't read anything in the book that would be any more classified than what was broadcasted on TV.
B0094U0RJQ|2.0|It's been said elsewhere that BD's voice has grown as raspy and unintelligible as the late Louie Armstrong's, and this album certainly lends credence to that claim. Consequently, I couldn't really decipher all of the words to all of the songs, but did notice that many (but not all) of the tunes are predicated on a very simple, repetitive and childlike syncopated beat. At least the Christmas album was comprised of historical and recognizable lyrics. One problem,I believe, is that many people are still expecting something along the lines of the early Dylan classics. A lot of these folks will be very disappointed in the current album.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this game is amazing because you get power ups. I also Thom this game is really fun because there are different goals to reach. Ohh and all of those people.who do not like this game you just aren't takers.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|I bought \\"Old ideas\\" some time ago and I didn't really listened to it till yesterday. I see that most reviewers are in agreement, this is another masterwork. So I will just join the chorus and dutifully sing the praises. Masterwork!<br /><br />Pd: My wife looked at me and said:\\" isn't it, this guy, kind of Tom Waits and Nick Cave, somehow? Well, somehow, I guess. God bless them all.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have never written a book review before but I felt other people interested in reading this should be warned.  This may be hands down THE worst book I have ever read.  People should be ashamed for giving this book more than the 1 star required.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|For starters, this isn't your typical happy Disney romp that you and the kids can enjoy (that is the Julia Robert's Mirror Mirror movie). Charlize Theron is the mega star actress in this movie. Even Chris Hemsworth shines as well. Kirstin Stewart is a frail manniquen as always... and she's the focal point of two feuding factions. Most of the time she's running from danger and toward the end she's caught between a wicked army and the rebels that rise against them. If only one faction were werewolf and the other vampire...<br /><br />It is funny how the name of the movie is Snow White and the Huntsman when it is really about the Wicked Queen / step mother of Snow White as she sends her men after Snow White. Charlize is on screen more than half the movie, which is a good thing, since she can act and even some super hero movies spend more time on the villain than the hero.<br /><br />The Wicked Queen searches for a way to stay magically young by absorbing the youth from fair maidens. She quickly takes over as queen after killing Snow White's father. Then she locks Snow White in a tower for a decade before the magic mirror tells her that she can stay eternally young by absorbing Snow White's youth. You'd think that would be the first soul she'd go after instead of going through the trouble to keep her for a decade... but whatever. Eventually she escapes and the queen sends her men and the Huntsman after her into an erie swamp.<br /><br />The sets and atmosphere stand out and someone spent a lot of time on them to make the movie feel different. This is not a happy world Snow White lives in. Everything is dead, dirty, creepy, black and wicked. There is still a happy magical setting in the middle of the movie that shines through all of the intentional ugly. With all of the creative settings, it does help keep the movie fresh.<br /><br />There is some good action, but this is still an adventure that will take you on a long journey even if it is not Disney's happy journey. There is plenty of magic and cool special effects, but some effects are overused like people shattering into things. Maybe they got a discount.
B005K01VZS|3.0|I had difficulty with the concept of Henry Covington being depicted as a man of faith. The \\"Reb\\" was truly a man of<br />faith. He spent his  entire life bringing the good word of God to his congregation through his actions and through his<br />sermons. Henry on the other hand was more like a sinner who was afraid that his luck had run out on the good times so<br />he directed his energies towards the homeless. I think his actions were prompted by fear more than faith.
B008XG1X18|4.0|App has worked well for me, although I've only had it for a week. I'm very happy I can finally enjoy Pinterest on my kindle!
B00992CF6W|5.0|BEST APP EVER TOTALY WORTH THE MONEY YOU WILL NEVER GET BORED IF U HAVE PC VERSION JOIN THIS SERVER IP: MCNATIONS.ORG
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the BEST book in the series! The writing pulls you into the story at such a level you ache when the characters do, heart races when the action heats up, and you'll find yourself gasping with every turn of the page. It's one of the best books I've read in a long time, and I will read it again and again!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I went on today and the screen is backwards and when I look up I look down and it tells me sometimes I cant open it plz fix this in the next update its annoying
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I became completely obsessed with this series after reading The Hunger Games, Book 1. It's a MUST READ! You'll read it so quickly you'll be sad it's over, so be sure to get all three books so you're prepared!<br />I love love love it!
B008J05EL8|1.0|Every time I try to open the Office Suite, it always tries to make to make me buy these fonts again and again. I've bought the fonts twice, but have yet to use the Office Suite.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a way to end such an amazing story. The detail in the writing paints a truly astonishing picture while capturing your attention and refusing to let go. You wont be able to put it down! The ends are all tied up so wonderfully you don't feel like you're missing anything, except for more Hunger Games! This final book is fantastic!
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|I continue to find the Jack Reacher tales a compelling read. Despite the fact that authorities now have technology available to them that might have complicated Reacher's progress and ability to evade detection, etc, I still find myself gripped by the tale and suddenly aware that it is the early hours of the morning....where do the hours go???? Thanks, Lee. Bring it on!.....
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is a lot of fun its great for trips and travel or when your taking a crape Lol burning really have no complaints
B0095T3H2U|5.0|I didn't have enormously high hopes for this film, but it only took about 5 minutes for me to realize that I was going to be in for a real treat. Jason Segel and Emily Blunt have great chemistry and the laughs are abundant. The best part about this film was the supporting characters and cameos from other Judd Apatow films. The story is a bit predictable (what romantic comedies aren't?) - but there were some creative elements that set it apart. This movie is definitely worth renting. Enjoy!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Seriously.  Terrible writing, one-dimensional, unrealistic characters...total waste of time.  I guess, if you want masturbatory material and don't have access to free internet porn, this may do the trick.  Honestly, I've found sexier scenes in Shakespeare.  Stupid.  Ashamed of myself for caving to peer pressure and reading this book.  I guess I should start writing because anyone can get published.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I bought a calculator before I found this and the keys stick .. wish I'd known about this app!  I really like the feature that acts like a &quot;tape &quot; so I can look back. Excellent!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|My kids love to play this game.  Its fun trying to earn coins to get the next game.  I would recommend this game for traveling.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Obviously it wasn't as good as the book but they castes Katniss perfectly. It was all good fun. I would look forward to the sequel.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I think this is a review of all of the author's experiences as a Navy SEAL.  The pre-publishing hype about the killing of Osama Bin Laden was over-blown.  That was only one of many operations described in this book.  I don't think there are any military secrets revealed here.  For me, it is a little disconcerting to know that we breed mercenaries in our military services but I guess that is the way of the world in the 21st century.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Fascinating story with interesting characters and change of scenes that were fun to read about.  However, it would be nice to read a Reacher novel without him bedding one of the female lead characters.
B0013WJGJ0|5.0|Kim Basinger and Michael Keaton did an Awesome job. Couldn't have picked a better JOKER than Jack Nicholson of that time! Wait n til they get a load of me!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I really like this app and I would request it for all kindle fire owners! The only problem is that when u have a low battery it pops up in the middle of whatever your doing.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Over the past 2 years I have owned 2 sets of these Logitech G930's. I love pretty much everything about them except for the fact that both pairs I have owned suffered from the exact same defects. The first pair I bought lasted me only about 6 months because I was a little rougher with them but in the end the wire that connects to the USB to charge the headphones was inoperable. I would plug it in and nothing. I had to charge it using another similar wire from my cell phone. Eventually they completely stopped working.<br /><br />It was a no brainer for me to purchase another pair because nothing else comes close at this price point and the wireless featur works flawlessly..I could wear these out to get the mail and still hear the sound from my games.<br /><br />The second pair I bought I told myself I was going to be a lot gentler with them, especially when plugging in the headset to charge as that is what made my last pair completely usueless. I am now 1 year into my 2nd pair and I have tape holding together the right ear cone but doesnt really affect the functionality to the extent that it annoys me. However I have not been able to use the wire to charge/use my headset since I bought them. I now have the USB stick plugged directly into the back of my PC. The charging port on the headphones is start to wear out as I have to make sure the wire is being pushed in with a slight amount of pressure before the headset will start charging. I am going to buy yet another pair of these because I love them so much despite their short comings. I just hope that they have worked out all of the kinks in this product in the year and a half since I purchased my last pair. If not then I will probably invest a couple hundred dollars more into the wireless Astros. I hope I dont have to though.<br /><br />In all these are very good headphones with a couple manufacturer defects that seem to be consistent issues but not serious enough to make me go elsewhere just yet.
B0086DB566|1.0|To begin with, I didn't mean to purchase this as a down load.  Second, I haven't been able to download the film.<br />So how can I rate something that I haven't seen and didn't mean to purchase.  I would accept a CD but I don't think you would do that now.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I really do enjoy this movie. So much so that my wife and I saw it twice in theater and I liked it so much that I then took other people to see the movie. So yes, I really do enjoy the movie.<br /><br />That said I'm rather let down by the packaging. From what I can only assume to be a way to make even more money off this release Marvel decided to stack the discs on top of each other. So you have on the left side the DVD and Digital Copy and on the right side the Blu Ray and the 3D Blu Ray. I'm OK with this style of packing for games like [[ASIN:B0091XHZW8 Guild Wars 2  [Download]]],[[ASIN:B001CWXAP2 Star Wars: The Old Republic]]where you only really need the discs once or even DVD's like [[ASIN:B0089TQ70Q Batman: Triple Feature]] where you know for the low price they will stack the DVDs.<br /><br />However, for a brand new release on Blu Ray i really do expect more. For examples see [[ASIN:B0053O89XI The Big Bang Theory: The Complete Fifth Season [Blu-ray]]] or [[ASIN:B001KVZ6G6 Up (Four-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + BD Live) [Blu-ray]]] for each of these and many other releases each disc gets its own slot. So hopefully your discs will hold up better with less chance to scratch or get damaged as you have to pull out one disc to get to the one below.<br /><br />I do really like the movie and I won't return it based on this, however I'm now stuck spending a few more dollars to get a proper blu ray case that can hold 4 discs[[ASIN:B003626OC2 1 Empty 22mm Thick QUAD Replacement Boxes/Cases for Blu-Ray DVD Movies - Holds 4 Discs - Blue (DV4R22BR)]]<br /><br />Thanks a lot Marvel.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I wasn't sure that I would like the series because I'm not really into science fiction literature, but I really liked this. I literally took every spare minute I had to read it, and got through it in about a week. Akin to the Hunger Games series, I was horrified, surprised, and mesmerized by Wool. It's like a train wreck you can't take your eyes off of.<br /><br />Wool was really was less science fiction, and more of a commentary on what we as human beings are willing to put each other through, and how much we can take before we hit our breaking point. I thought that the Wool series was very well written and very well thought out.<br /><br />I thought the ending was a little weak for how much I had invested in reading the series, but I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good story that makes you think.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I have found Kik to be an excellent alternative to texting.  One feature texting does not have is the ability to see that the person you are corresponding with is composing a text.  When one is sending texts in a chat-like fashion this feature allows the communication to flow more like a conversation.<br /><br />One improvement that I would like to suggest is the ability to save a thread of texts if one chooses to do so.  Currently, Kik only has a record of the last approx. 100 messages.  New messages then push out the old ones and they are gone forever.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This popped up on my recommendations and after trying a sample I had to keep going, it has twist after twist, and I don't want to give anything away or it'll ruin it - the characters are incredibly well written and the story sucks you in, your allegiance swings from one character to the next and the relationships are psychologically believable.  Well worth the read.
0525953728|5.0|I was hooked on this book from the moment I picked it up.  Read it cover to cover in a few hours.  Not a hard read but definitely engaging and makes you proud to be an American, and gives you a new found perspective through the struggles that are armed service personnel go through.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read. Cant wait to read the rest of the books soon .check it out.  you will like it top
B001NLL0RW|3.0|From the beginning I wasn't excited about this book.  I read maybe 1/16th of the whole novel. Just didn't have any get up and go.
B0087HT36U|4.0|fun game. pretty simple to play and get golds. hard to beat some timed ones on kindle fire cause of lag, but fun other than that.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|This movie is a must ! I have a 3 1/2 year old watching it and she LOVES it.... Also the older kids think it is good.  Great for the whole family.
B0084YAU86|5.0|If you aren't already watching Sherlock....get on board. This show, in only 6 episodes, is a fantastic series that embodies all we love about Sherlock Holmes with a modern twist. This Season 2 finale is a riveting conclusion to the season and only leaves fans like myself DESPERATELY waiting for season 3 to be filmed and aired! Cumberbatch is the perfect Holmes and I cannot imagine anyone besides Freeman in the role of Watson.
B004UID2LC|5.0|thank you, whoever gave the fix to this app, because after i got the one from the website, it totally worked!
B008XG1X18|5.0|great ideas and recipes! Its for the everyday people. So many great ideas for meals on a budget with downhome taste.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really enjoyed how this book was written. I liked how the whole book was dedicated to becoming a SEAL and the time leading up to the UBL Mission. I learned a lot about these heros, and appreciate them all the more for what they do. I also LOVED how the book reads like a movie. It was easy to imagine what the author was writing about. I HIGHLY recommend this book. One for the history books.
0765316994|2.0|Loved the idea. The crude language and three codas were a letdown. After a promising start, I was left with the feeling it could have been so much more.
B009329ZF2|3.0|After watching this movie, I decided that it must have been written by a 12-year old.  So many improbabilities that I can't even begin to count.  You don't just join the navy and become an officer at the O-3 level.  that takes time.  You don't just grab a battle ship and steal it in front of a few hundred people.  Any story whether fact or fiction has to be real.  this movie was just not real.  While somewhat enjoyable until near the end, it just wasn't worth the cost to see it.  So, speaking as an old Navy vet, save your money.
B0016OLC5Q|4.0|Its an interesting story for sure.  But being that McCandless died, the entire movie of his journey is pretty much conjecture.  Was he stupid or did he just have a death wish?  Why wait until after graduation from an expensive college to go on a one way walkabout? We will never know, and this movie just takes some guesses at what was going on in his mind. Hopefully this movie will show people how stupid it is to go out unprepared and untrained into a hostile environment.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Great app, now I just want more levels.... Some were so easy to just breeze through. But all very entertaining nonetheless. would reccommend and am waiting for updates!
B0087HT36U|4.0|This game is like angry birds, but who fricken cares! If you don't like it don't play it  but its still pretty fun
B00122PUL4|5.0|If you like Dio, this is a great collection of his work with Black Sabbath. Always love his vocals, and with Sabbath behind him the overall quality is fantastic
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Its a pretty fun game to pass the time, however I wish that it were easier to collect the puzzle pieces needed to unlock other levels. All in all I rate this a 3 of 5
B0010X745K|5.0|I like this film, but it is a negative movie in the extreme. So much of what I write will seem negative as well. It is a reflection of the film's negativity, not a negative opinion about the film, which is IMO actually very well done as a horror film. I like and admire the work, and have no intention of ever watching it again. But I am glad I did watch it once. Once was more than enough.<br /><br />I had heard about \\"The Mist\\" and of course that it was based on a Stephen King novella. That meant, it had to have some horrifying aspects and incredible twists. King always conjures up a good scare and the unexpected. I do not know how true this film is to the book, but as a monster flick, it's right up there and then some. The movie, \\"The Mist\\" delivers King type elements, in spades, along with a serious social commentary and morality tale of a very dark nature.<br /><br />Please consider taking the title of this review to heart -- this film is deep on many levels (sometimes hard to believe because much of the human actions are irrational) and will leave some viewers feeling, well, rather disturbed. If that is your cup of tea, you'll love it. If disturbing films aren't to your liking, you may not enjoy it.<br /><br />In fact, as much as I admire the film (it is extremely well made), I have absolutely no desire to see it again, any more than I have a desire to whack my thumb with a hammer. Because that is basically what \\"The Mist\\" is, a mental whack with a hammer, over and over again! Curiosity (which got me to watch the film) can sometimes be a very unfortunate thing!<br /><br />The story is a mix of very weak sci-fi and mostly horror.<br /><br />Many reviewers liken it to 50's monster flicks, but nothing in the 50's was as disturbing as this film is. In fact, this film does what the 50's films were trying to do - it scares the daylights out of the viewer on many levels. But in the 50's films, we knew the monsters weren't real nor could they possibly be. In this film, we're not so sure about that! And none of the films of the 50's were able to deliver a sense of loss and hopelessness the way this movie does. It's a total downer!<br /><br />But the 50's were a different time and had a different audience. In the 50's monster flicks, the army, or scientists or the government comes to the rescue, the monsters are defeated (after causing a great deal of destruction of course) and we are left with a sense of hope and of a \\"lesson learned\\" (i.e. don't do nuclear experiments on lizards).<br /><br />We are much more cynical in the 21st Century and have more of a sense of hopelessness. Look at all the \\"end of the world\\" movies and their disturbing popularity. Look at the \\"science\\" shows on cable TV that attempt to prove the prophecies of global destruction by religious and psychics alike. This would never fly in the 50's. Not that the 50's were a great time, but there was a sense of hope that is no longer in vogue.<br /><br />And so \\"The Mist\\" is true to its time. It is utterly hopeless, which is what makes it so compelling and disturbing - if you like that sort of thing.<br /><br />I say the sci-fi is weak because it is only used as an excuse for how the mist in \\"The Mist\\" came about. Basically, it's a one liner used to explain the mist and set up a chance for the human monsters to be, well, monstrous in the way history has shown us to be over and over again. Think of the hysteria of the Salem Witch Trials, the Inquisition (which went on for over 100 years) and the current wave of terrorism around the world, the riots incensed by zealots. We aren't a nice bunch. This film capitalizes on the worst in human nature. So does the news. So which is scarier?<br /><br />They really didn't have to explain anything about how the mist got to be there (as the movie, \\"Cloverfield\\" offered no explanations for its monster). It might have been even more disturbing if they hadn't.<br /><br />What IS disturbing is the monsters. They are many, and they are relentless - inside and out. To explain that, I have to give away some of the premise.<br /><br />***** Spoiler Alert *****<br /><br />A seemingly natural disaster affects a small town (probably in New England - this is based on a King story) starting with a strange and violent electrical storm, followed by the appearance of a creeping mist coming towards the small nameless town. Because of the storm, many of the townspeople have done what we all do in natural emergencies. They run to the stores to stock up on supplies.<br /><br />When in doubt, Buy Stuff!<br /><br />But this time, the mist catches a group of people off guard and traps them in a supermarket. The group is widely diverse and at first glance seem like ordinary folk, although there is a sense of tension in that many of the locals do not get along. This group of \\"survivors\\" (if you can call them that) have to deal with the onslaught of other-worldly monsters that are the denizens of the mysterious mist. How they do it is the crux of the film.<br /><br />You see, it's not just the monsters IN the mist, it's the monsters hiding FROM the mist that are equally terrifying, or perhaps disturbingly disappointing. We like to think that human beings are capable of doing better. In this film, most of the humans are at their worst.<br /><br />Those monsters, the ones in the supermarket, are US, or US as portrayed in the movie seen through a cynical but ironically parallel-to-reality view.<br /><br />Several human characters are of course over-the-top stereotypes (i.e. the town \\"hicks\\", the crazy religious zealot, the cowardly soldiers), but others are disturbingly normal, who exhibit the human proclivity for following the leader, no matter how crazy that leader may be.<br /><br />So we see human irrationality in full play as these people try to find answers to their situation, or find someone to blame (which they do, more than once). And this irrationality is why their actions, with each other, and in attempting to fend off the monsters of the mist, are equally irrational. The movie is pointing out how irrational many of us really are and how that just makes a huge mess.<br /><br />To see people behaving in this manner is very disturbing because, ironically, we see it on the news every day, where some very vocal and sometimes violent people follow insane politicians, self-styled gurus of science and philosophy, religious propagandists, and media moguls who lead them by the nose into the depths of irrationality. In this aspect, the movie \\"The Mist\\" is NO fiction!<br /><br />This is probably the social commentary of the film, that people are basically sheep, that some of us show courage, some show cowardice, and it is easy to pick a scapegoat when things get tough. All of this is true, of course, but the movie hammers it home again and again, as relentlessly as the monsters in the mist attack the humans, and indeed they do!<br /><br />Of course the mist monsters are what people want to see. The movie makes use of the time-honored cliches and cultural monster icons (hence not terribly original, but scary all the same) that terrify us on our deepest psychological and instinctive levels.<br /><br />Most of the monsters are, of course, insects -- horrific creepy crawly insects, large mosquito-like flying insects, nasty beetle type insects with vicious teeth, and of course, spiders, lots and lots of spiders. They are horrifyingly larger than life but not entirely gigantic, horrifyingly voracious, and painfully slow killing insects. When people are bitten, stung or otherwise attacked by these creatures, oh yeah, it hurts! There's no shortage of blood curdling screaming in this movie, and the blood flows pretty generously as well.<br /><br />Of course, the bugs are not alone. We get terrified on other instinctive levels by monsters with clawed and toothy tentacles (think of giant squids and octopus, even snakes), and flying bird/gargoyle type monsters with bat wings (the old demon batscare) who are after the insects but won't stop eating there. These creatures look disturbingly like monsters I saw in an old video game called \\"Alone in the Dark\\". The movie dishes these creatures up very effectively, horrifyingly, and almost relentlessly. They may be cliche, but they work. Why re-invent the wheel?<br /><br />The ultimate GIANT monster is seen near the end of the film and ironically, it doesn't harm anyone. It's just so terrifying to see, and it is hard to forget. BUT you'll have to wade through two hours of horror to get to it.<br /><br />As scary and totally unforgettable (and indescribable) as this final monster is, it's not the end of the film, though you might think so.<br /><br />We do get set up for the ultimate hopelessness and the ultimate choice between life and death as we hear monsters growling in the mist just out of sight. Yeah, they're probably on the move and our intrepid few survivors better do something quick and desperate. BUT, hang on to your seat, the worst is YET to come!<br /><br />The final horror and disturbance comes with the ending, one worthy of Rod Serling's \\"Twilight Zone\\". It is a \\"I NEVER saw that coming\\" ending, one that is deeply tragic and hopeless and teaches a strict moral in the most horrible way:<br /><br />\\"When things get bad, if you act in desperation, even with the best of intentions, you may regret it.\\"<br /><br />I have read that this is NOT the ending in King's book, that he offered more hope. But, this IS the 21st Century, and hopelessness is the new fashion. The movie is a product of its time.<br /><br />Fortunately, time moves forward, and hopefully we're better than the characters and monsters of this film, because the cavalry may arrive just a few minutes too late.<br /><br />-------------------------<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />As a horror film, \\"The Mist\\" is a top-notch movie. Scary as all get out.<br /><br />As a sci-fi flick, well, it's like calling a calculator a computer - there just is no real sci-fi in it because there is no science of any kind in it, not a single lab coat or test tube even!<br /><br />It is a monster film for sure, but that does not qualify it as science fiction, just fiction and possibly fantasy. But there be monsters a-plenty!<br /><br />As a social commentary, it is cynical, cruel and a downer. It is brutally honest a product of the worst in 21st century thinking.<br /><br />Acting - Top notch, totally convincing, and amazingly annoying at times.<br /><br />Suspense - Amazing, cliff hanging, with the usual \\"NO, don't go in there!\\" feeling that marks the standard horror genre.<br /><br />Pacing - Not too fast, they want the horror to sink in before the next onslaught.<br /><br />Special Effects - Excellent<br /><br />Comic Relief (often found in horror films to relieve tension) - Are you kidding? None of that stuff here!<br /><br />If you liked the movie \\"Cloverfield\\", you may also like this film.<br /><br />If you are a Stephen King fan, you may also enjoy the film, although I can't say how closely it follows the book.<br /><br />If you like twists, and can stomach it through to the ending, you'll get a BIG surprise.<br /><br />I'll never look at fog and other weather patterns the same again.<br /><br />And, just for fun, take a look at you local supermarket next time it snows.

B005LAIGYQ|5.0|I did not just see a movie ,I had an experience. I was not in the military, but I do have a respect,admiration, and a total gratitude for the men and women that serve our country.<br /><br /> As for the film,I was totally submurged in what I saw and was both thrilled by the action and brought to tears by the sacrifice. This is a must see movie .
B007SYWFRM|3.0|love the game but had to replace my kindle now it is not available for newer kindle. please fix this .....
B007IXWKUK|2.0|This book is written at about 3rd grade level however if you are looking for sex, it's there ad nauseum, redundant and by the 3rd book boring.  I read it to see what all the hype was about and can see why women would want to live vicariously through the character; who doesn't want a sexy, good looking, rich guy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Why so many did not like this is beyond me. Maybe they should not read the reviews first so it wont spoil it for them. They may get bored because they know what happens. It did leave me hoping there may be another one coming. 09.24.12
B0058YPL66|5.0|Once Upon a Time is a series that keeps you on the edge of your seat!  It weaves the traditional and non traditional fairy tales meshed with modern small town, USA. This is a MUST-SEE series.

B007WFR1MQ|5.0|I've been a huge Fear Factory fan since I was little. I've loved all of their albums except one, and that one was Mechanize. I can't really explain why I didn't like it except the fact that to me it didn't feel like a Fear Factory cd to me. I tried and tried to like it but I just couldn't. I guess to me it just seemed more like every other industrial metal band out there. So I had almost given up hope on this band cause Transgression wasn't supreme but I still liked it. I decided to give this cd a try, instead of listening to their older cds wondering what happened to one of my favorite bands, and I instantly fell in love. It sounded exactly like what made me love Fear Factory in the first place! So if you are a lover of Fear Factory and are like me and didn't care for the last album, or even if you did like their last album, pick this one up for sure. I don't mean any disrespect to the people who liked Mechanize, like I said it just wasn't for me.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Great self empowerment tool, second only to \\"the Secret\\" Highly recommend that.<br />Humanity would greatly benefit with a working knowledge of this material.<br /><br />Thanks..
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game brings back memories of being a child at the fair hoping to be the one to win the coins. It's a great,  relaxing,  FREE,  game. I love the sound effects as well.
B000J025AE|4.0|I loved this movie! It got my heart racing and saying \\"GO GO GO GO GO NOOOO OMG!!!! O MY GOD! HURRY UP!!!\\" about every 5 minutes. It was INTENSE. I saw the Poseidon adventure when I was about 13 (my dad doesn't have an age limit on movie recommendations for kids) and found this one to be better. I actually thought the Poseidon Adventure from the 70s was terrifying and traumatic but this one was scary in a more wholesome way, the kind of scary that you might have to cover your eyes for if you don't like corpses floating in water or with their eyes open and the kind of foreboding scary to the nth degree. However, I think I agree with a previous reviewer that said there was less character development. That is true- but Josh Lucas makes a great, believable hero and a very likable guy- going from a dry playboy to a wet Achilles. Kurt Russell is fantastic as always! A nice replacement for Gene Hackman. This movie was a 'heart-quality-testing' thrill ride in every sense. I recommend to anybody that likes adventure books and movies.
B009157BWU|3.0|This movie would make a good TV special, but it's not good enough for a movie.  It has very stunning senery.  The primates were interesting, but the movie seemed really short.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|This is a straightforward story of the life of a seal.  It is not just about Bid Laden, but is about the man's experiences as a seal.  Keeps your attention without the \\"cowboy\\" hype.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Learn the truth. Read this book. The author is truthfully setting the record straight. Well written by a hero of our nation and honest.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This game was fun, and challenging enough to war rent getting gold on each level without being discouraging or frustrating.
B008X8P8A8|1.0|As a fan of the Total War series of games I was excited to try this out. I knew this would have hex based movement on the battlefield, which is alright since you're using a touchscreen. The problem I have is that besides the name and location of this game, absolutely nothing else about it has anything to do with Shogun Total War. The campaign map is really just linear path that allows you to select the next battle you want to advance to. As if you really had a choice because there's only one path to follow. The battles have you place buildings on the map which are used to crank out units that march across the map towards your opponents base. Winning involves some silly objective like kill X amount of this or build X amount of that.<br /><br />The people who designed this game had the chance to bring something truly amazing to the tablet world of gaming; instead they followed the unimaginative and tired Zynga formula for garbage gaming. Yes that's right in app purchasing is available for anyone who wants to \\"win\\" with little effort.

B00701L5XS|5.0|I got Knots 3D to have it handy as a ready reference when helping my son and other Boy Scouts with their lashings.  It is like having a ready reference in your pocket all the time.  The ability to see the knot from any angle helps show the scouts how it is done and using the \\"electronic gizmo\\" adds a little more fun and excitement into the process of learning the knots.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is the most recent book that this author has written, and by far, the best. After I read this book, I decided to read her other two books. It doesn't move very quickly in the beginning, but if you have the patience, you will be in a for a surprise. I was amazed by the ending of the book and can see where people could either love it or hate it because of the ending.<br />It's about a husband and wife who move from New York to the midwest so the husband can take care of his mother who is dying. The wife disappears, and the book bounces back and forth between what the husband is doing and diary entries from the missing wife. The whole time, you're wondering if the husband killed the wife or if something else is going on. Gillian Flynn can write suspense! You never know for sure until the ending.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|Another gem. David's still got it. The voice may sound older but the songs are still from that zany wild wonderful imagination called David Bowie. Favorite cuts;Fall Dog Bombs the Moon,New Killer Star, She'll Drive the Big Car,Bring Me the Disco King, the Loneliest Guy...There are two wonderful covers:George Harrison's Try Some,Buy Some and Jonathan Richman's Pablo Picasso. Even the filler songs are good on this cd. Now's the time to get caught up on your Bowie collection as there are many very inexpensively priced in the used catagory. The longer this period of reclusiveness the higher the prices will become. I imagine Bowie paraphenalia on the net will take off to the stratosphere soon. Something tells me we haven't heard the last of this guy yet! Go ahead overindulge yourself! Also recommended=Heathen. We will find out who the heathens are after Dec 21,2012. Just kidding.

0316926345|4.0|I picked up this early 20th century English novel based upon its inclusion in Everyman's Library of 100 Essential Books.  The story was, in fact, about what you would expect from such a period piece if you've read other novels of the period such as Atonement and Howard's End.<br /><br />At its heart, the story revolves around a somewhat aimless young man, Charles Ryder, without much of a family foundation, set adrift at Oxford College during the period between the World Wars.  While there, he meets a young member of the aristocracy and essentially adopts the young man's family as his own.  The story follows the relationships and history of the eccentric Flyte family in three different threads, first during the Second World War and then in flashbacks to the early 20s and then the late 30s.  In doing so, the author injects numerous comments and allusions to the Roman Catholic faith (and apostasy) of his characters.<br /><br />While I have read several works by Dickens, I found much of the florid prose in this story more difficult to appreciate, perhaps because it is written in the patois of the early 20th century English aristocracy.  When the story was following a timeline narrative, I can say that I enjoyed it quite a bit.  However there were many periods of little or no activity, in which I felt the momentum of the novel grind to a halt.<br /><br />Certainly, the culture and practices of the English aristocracy, viewed by modern standards, seem ridiculous and silly to us today.  This novel focuses on the period when deterioration of the rigid English class structure accelerated and essentially shattered with the outbreak of the Second World War.  It bears noting, however, that it was exactly this seemingly ridiculous culture that resulted in a tiny island nation ruling over one of the greatest empires ever known.  \\"From whom much is given, much is expected\\", could have been the byword of 19th century English society, and while much was certainly given, expectations were not found wanting.were not found wanting.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This game is really fun. Its similar to angry birds. Lots of level. Good and fun game for all ages.
B0087HT36U|5.0|With the exception of the quirky destroyed-disappeared-but-still-exists beam that pops up sometimes, I really enjoy this app.  Despite the naysayers, I managed to get the gold crown on every level on my Fire (though some levels are tricky.)  When one strategy doesn't work, try something else.  Look for clues in the construction.  I've been through the game several times, trying to top my high scores and still enjoy it, though I hope they'll expand to additional levels soon.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|If you enjoy the search games you'll really enjoy this. Good graphics and good story line but maybe a little short. Anxious for part two.
B009329ZF2|3.0|This was an entertaining movie.  It could've been great with the budget and the actors they had, but it seems like they dumbed the story down to appeal to a wider age range and it damaged the quality of the film.  It was good, but good in the kind of way where you spend the whole time focusing on how it had the potential to be great.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|I could not put the book down the moment I started.  I was disappointed that I saw the movie before I read the book.  I bet I would have loved the movie that much more.<br /><br />Maybe I am crazy for saying this, but let's face it this book should be in the Classics section of your local bookstore, but the problem with that, there are no more local bookstores.
B0069UP2PI|3.0|\\"Contagion\\" is a docu-drama style movie that follows various characters through a pandemic that is brought back from China by one of the characters at the beginning of the movie. I was interested in the way the disease moved through the population but couldn't get very sympathtic with the characters in the movie.  It was good enough to keep my attention but not as dramatic as \\"Outbreak.\\" So I'll give it three stars...
034580404X|5.0|good deal! good reads at great price! The book is kind of kinky and the story line is typically a rich guy-average girl story with the \\"kinky\\" part as its twist. but i enjoyed reading it not because of the erotic scenes but the cute sweet moments they have,most especially the bidding scene.first books i read in like, forever and finished it in just a week.yep,that's how you're gonna get hooked to it. :)<br /><br />purchased two sets of this trilogy and The item came in the mail for my friend two weeks earlier than expected! kudos to my seller! :)
1250010489|5.0|This novel was more of a straight Tom Clancy-style action thriller than Russinovich's first novel, Zero Day, which might make this one more appealing to a wider audience, but the potential to incorporate technical material into the story is something that could make a Russinovich novel stand out.  I liked Zero Day better, so this one gets a 4.5 (rounded up for Amazon), which means it's still definitely recommended, but I hope his next one will be less 'Clancy' and more 'Kernel' (and with a title of \\"50 Shades of Rootkit\\" it would probably sell a million copies the first week ;-)
B00846REIS|4.0|Loved Loved Loved Loved Loved this book. It is so well written, the storyline is such a great mix of the love story, the emotional backgrounds of all the characters and just the right amount of angst. October 2nd cannot come fast enough for book 2.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was looking for a new book that would get me interested from the start, and this book did just that! It had a great plot and was very suspenseful. I could hardly put the book down. I would highly recommend this read.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|PROS<br />-Very easy to program.<br />-Detailed macro setup.<br />-Informative LCD and aesthetics.<br />-Good tactile feedback on thumb controller and main keys.<br />-Comfortable ergonomics<br />-Long USB cord.<br /><br />CONS<br />-Thumb controller button is hard to press and can only be pressed when in center position.<br />-Recessed gray buttons around thumb controller have long throw and are poor tactile feedback.<br />-WASD keys are indented but it would be nice to have a small nib on S in order to help center your fingers.<br />-Thumb controller cannot be calibrated to reposition North.<br /><br />None of these cons prevent me from loving this controller and highly recommending others to get it.  The muscle-memory learning curve is steep for a traditional keyboard/mouse PC gamer, but for modern games with so many additional keymaps, it's a necessity to free up your left hand (WASD) in order to perform other tasks.
B000NOKAFS|1.0|the movie was just ok but the lapdance was really intensely done its not worth ur money  save it for something better
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I learned to play Mahjong on my desktop computer a couple of decades ago.  I was thrilled to see this version available for my Fire!  It has so many different levels to try to master that it will take me a while to get there.  In the meantime, I am thoroughly enjoying the fantastic HD graphics that were obviously not present in the computer game. lol.  Apparently all the glitches that gave this game a bad review have been fixed.  I have played for hours without any force closes, Freezes, or shutdowns.
B001MSMUH0|5.0|This is a must read. I work in education and knew of Ken Robinson through his TED talks and YouTube videos  but his writing is a compelling, call to action. If you think you are doing what you should be in life this will only serve as a confirmation of that. One of the most important books I've read in my lifetime.
B008D28HYS|4.0|I was leary of another puzzle at first, but the price was right and the reviews were good.  I have really enjoyed this puzzle.  Couldn't put it down.  Even took it to the gym and played while on the treadmill...lol.  The puzzle definitely gets harder as you go, and I am currently at a stand still.  Very chanllenging!!
0307341550|4.0|\\"Sharp Objects\\" is a dark and disturbing yet strangely addictive psychological thriller - although feeling slightly nauseous by the actions of some of the characters I was unable to put the book down until I had all the answers.<br /><br />Camille Preaker, working as a journalist for a small newspaper in Chicago, is sent to investigate the disappearance of a young girl in Wind Gap, the rural Missouri town where she grew up. Less than a year ago another young girl was murdered and mutilated there in similar circumstances. Camille's misgivings about her new assignment soon become obvious when she returns to the family home she fled more than a decade ago - because this is one very dysfunctional family. As Camille starts to investigate the murders, the deep dark secrets of the town - and Camille's own life - slowly come to light. With troubling memories of her own childhood slowly closing in on her, Camille is struggling to keep her sanity - and stay alive .....<br /><br />As in [[ASIN:030758836X Gone Girl: A Novel]], Flynn beautifully portrays her flawed characters, unmasking them slowly, layer by layer, down to the rotten core. Festering under the surface of seemingly \\"normal\\" people lie troubled and sick minds, with secrets so horrible that they will stay with you long after the last page has been turned. Camille's scars are more than skin-deep - as she is slowly falling into the clutches of her dysfunctional family, it soon becomes obvious how children can be harmed in more ways than physical abuse.<br /><br />Without giving too much away, this book is not for the faint hearted, its horror not lying in graphic descriptions but in the dark undercurrents of its characters' minds. The ending will shock and surprise - or maybe not, because by then the reader has been shocked and surprised enough times to know that anything is possible. A psychological thriller which will push you to the edge - realising that evil can come in many disguises.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Good book.  I enjoyed the behind the scenes thoughts of the writer and his interpretation of the surrondings in the missions.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|Our family loves to play this game.  The kids age range from 10 to 15 and they always ask to play.  We are working on getting all the expansions to this and look forward to playing for years.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book! It very much so reminded me of a modern Catcher in the Rye for my generation. The surreal moments charlie experiences with his friends, where they feel infinite, is something many of us have experienced. Maybe, these common connecting points is what made this book feel so personal. In those moments you cant help but reflect on your own past experiences and that gives each person their own hidden smile  on the same passage
B0087HT36U|4.0|its fun! its addicting and challenges the mind!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!! I could play it for hours! my kids even like to play it as it is easy for them to play as well.

B009329ZF2|5.0|This was a great movie. There was no buffering. You can fast-forward, back- up or pause it as you wish. Iwish they would do a 24 hour rental, not much use for the movie after you watch it once.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Couldn't put this book down. It was interesting from the start and the author does a good job of keeping the story flowing while developing the characters. I have read the second in the series and am looking forward to the third.
B002IVLH60|5.0|I was very happy with the price of the CD that I purchased.  I received the CD in a timely manner and the CD was in great shape.  I love the music on the CD.  I had only heard one song when Pearl Jam was on an old Saturday Night Live that I caught on VH1.  I love the music on the entire CD. I always go to Amazon first when I am looking to purchase a CD, DVD or book.
B008JTK9NW|4.0|Over the last few albums from P.O.D., they have evolved their sound where it sounds more mature and a little darker. \\"Murdered Love\\" finds the band returning to its roots of fusing rap/hip-hop and rock  to bring us the most energetic album since \\"Satellite.\\" Not only is the album a blast to listen all the way through, it sounds like the fellas from P.O.D. had a lot of fun recording the album as well, which is usually a good sign for the listeners since the good vibes and energy bleed through the audio.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I wasn't happy with the unexpected import charge levied.  The product was good value for the money. Very pleased with it.

B0090EHVMC|5.0|I had my niece (age 11) and nephew (age 8) sleeping over my house. I own very few kid movies. I tried netflix streaming movies selection but it was very limited and many of the movies are really old. The kids have seen almost all the movies netflix has to offer. So I thought about Amazon Instant Movie because the selection is large and current. The kids loved the movie and I like the simplicity of ordering the movie through Amazon. It was simple, quick and the movie played back in high quality. Will use Amazon Movies again.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|TripAdvisor did not steer us wrong! Great to have the reviews.....really helpful whenever looking for a hotel or resturant. The only downfall was I could not see my saved places without an internet connection, which would have helped because I did not always have a connection and I had a lot of things in my saved area.
031236198X|1.0|A complete waste of time.  It tells you nothing you don't already know. Save your money.  I was forced to buy this for a company training seminar, and I'm convinced that the author is somebody's brother-in-law.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This app is so helpful with school work  and annotating for class. It is easy to use and conveniently there whenever I need it. Especially the read out that plays the words.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|Never say don't judge a book by it's cover! I bought this book in 2003, not having heard a thing about it, just because I was attracted by the tiger on the cover. It looked original. And it was the best decision I made! Now it has come out as an ebook and I'm not even going to say a thing about the plot as even the slightest hint of what happens I would consider to be a spoiler. All I can say is YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK!! It is a classic and I can promise you won't have read anything like it in your whole life. 5 Stars all the way!
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|big dumb waste of your time.  at least in the real game u can win real prizes. this game is totally lame.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It is a fun app. but it would be nice if there were more ways to gain points to unlock the further levels, because there are times were you get stuck playing the same games over again to gain points and it becomes boring.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|If you do not care for dystopian trilogies, then these are not for you. I, however, love them and the first two book to this series are beautifully written. Lauren Oliver, paints the picture to these books perfectly. I can easily imagine being in the book and am hoping for a movie.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|\\"Downton Abbey\\" is the best thing on TV.  I can't wait for Season 3 which I think will air on PBS in the U.S. starting in January 2013.
B007T99ENE|3.0|I read this book while on holiday and in my view it was only ok. For me a girl with such intelligence seemed to be incredibly naive even stupid and not in an endearing way. The tedium was well described and this work had no joy or challenge for me.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I just love how I can use this and it syncs with my kindle fire, android phone, and my PC.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I thought this book was the best of the three but she still took too long to get to the point so the book dragged. Overall it was ok but I wish I hadn't spent my money I wouldn't recommend others to purchase borrow it instead if possible not worth what you pay for. Of course I did get caught wanting to read because everyone was talking about it but not my taste of good writing I noticed a lot of typos and mistakes as I read which was annoying.
0385344333|3.0|Like all Reacher fans was looking forward to new book, thankfully I didn't buy but got from library. Since Child sold out by letting his 6'5\\" character be portrayed by a 5'6\\" actor I have lost interest in buying his books.  In \\"A Wanted Man\\" Reacher is worn out and the plot was too, very little action and more dialog which Child is not good at. In a lot of the Reacher books it will say \\"Reacher said nothing\\" now I know why...he's got nothing to say.
B0058VW36U|5.0|must have game gets new levels as it grows. worth easily $5.00 you will not regret buying varies from easy to challenging
0525478817|3.0|this was my first and possibly last YA novel. i took the word of another middle-aged woman and ordered it. while i admit that i did get sucked into the storyline, and even cried a couple times (partially attributed to hormone imbalance, i suspect,) the pretentious language of practically all the characters drove me crazy. i guess the worst part of this experience was the relentless hammering of Meaning and Deep Thoughts . completely heavy-handed and overwrought. better to say less than too much, would be my advice to the author. but he will never take it because there are thousands of kids and other readers out there giving him 5 stars.<br /><br />as a mother of girls 12 and 14, i was totally bummed when hazel and gus had sex. i cannot hand this book over to my girls anytime soon because of this. (and they might have actually enjoyed this book.) i can only imagine the conversation about the sexual encounter going something like, \\"well....i guess if you are BOTH dying of cancer any day and you don't have to worry about pregnancy and STD's, you can have sex. but ONLY then!\\"<br /><br />i wish YA authors would understand that when they write teen sex, 16-year old girls think they have some kind of endorsement for it. from the author, from the characters they admire. permission and encouragement, given to them from someone who doesn't even know them, care about them or love them. i will return back into the world of adult fiction and not look back, thanks to the fault of this overly-written book.
B001N4RORE|5.0|I love that I can take it with me and enjoy it over and over again on the convenience of the fire.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Love, love, LOVED this album! I'm new to Imagine Dragons, but also like other similar bands like Awolnation and Switchfoot. It took me a bit of getting used to, but now I am basically in love with this band, and love almost every single song on this album. Definitely would recommend for people who like bands like Switchfoot, Awolnation, Owl City, Mutemath, etc.
B0087HT36U|5.0|it is good clean fun! it is good for younger kids and older kids! i particularly enjoy it because it has good graphics.
B007I1Q4W2|4.0|In the wake of an incredible explosion of films and television embracing Director George A. Romero's living dead cycle as of late, there are always some gems that seem to arise within the muck of remakes, pandemic clones and virtual blood baths leading up to nothing.  Writer/Director John Geddes's 'EXIT HUMANITY'-2011 is just that rare gem.  By placing the story during the decline of the Civil War,  we see how the survivors try to cope with an outbreak of living dead through a diary which has survived over the years seeming to be found by modern day humans facing their own living dead onslaught.  The audience is treated as a reader of the document as pages are turned and chapters are introduced while our main character Edward Young continues to write installments till the films conclusion. What Mr. Geddes tries to show in this affair is that their were scrolls of rituals that have survived since the dawn of man that contain spells that can reanimate the dead and that a woman who dabbled in witchcraft had them in her possession. One of the films characters introduced in the middle of the film came across these scrolls and decided to resurrect her dead sister with disastrous results culminating in the spreading of the virus. Interlocked with this story is a sub plot involving a civil war general who's in serious denial that the war is over and is using his megalomania to control what is left of humanity.  Unfortunately, the films only flaw is it length.  The performances are spot on:  Mark Gibson is our main character who gives a remarkable performance in coping with the loss of family and the ever growing  nightmare quickly surrounding him who's diary narration is done by actor Brian Cox giving it an eerie maturity during the proceedings; a beautiful performance by actress Dee Wallace giving her role of Eve, the woman of the forest, incredible fragility and strength; and almost cameos by actors Bill Moseley and Stephen McHattie.  The gorgeous cinematography by Brendon Uegama filmed in Ontario, Canada elevates the film from being just another low budget zombie entry and our living dead cast are adorned with excellent makeup and just the right shambling to give this film the kick it deserves. The film is released to DVD by a company called Bloody Disgusting films in a beautiful 2.35 transfer with excellent sound to enhance the eerieness. Director Geddes leaves us with an unsettling feeling that every hundred years an outbreak of living dead could occur giving our modern day news stories of government training in coping with possible zombie occurrences hackle raising food for thought. For those looking for an unusual way of spending yet another moment with the living dead until they actually rise, click the add to cart button and enjoy this welcome entry into the Zombie canon.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My son has watched this everyday since the first time he saw it! My husband isn't that big of a fan so my son and I watch it before he gets home!! Highly recommend this one.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|In a world dominated by club-ready synthpop, it was was weird hearing Carly Rae Jepsen's \\"Call Me Maybe\\" for the first time. Like \\"We Are Young\\" and \\"Somebody That I Used To Know\\" before it, the song seemed so out of place on today's pop radio and yet so ready to take over the world with its undeniable hooks. However, unlike those other two songs, which drew more from contemporary indie rock, \\"Maybe\\" took a more string-laden, '90s bubblegum pop-oriented approach and, combined with its simple yet incredibly effective lyrics and hooks that quite effectively put you in the mind of a teenage girl (even if  Jepsen is currently well into her twenties), you get one of the best releases of 2012 (pop or otherwise) and which will will surely be considered a timeless pop classic.
B005LAJ22Q|4.0|The sound of them talkin is low but the music and sound effects are just rite. Other than that I love the show and can't wait to see season 3.

0525953728|1.0|To be brief:<br /><br />As a former Army aviator of the Viet Nam War, I couldn't discover anything which struck me as having come from factual 'boots-on-the-ground.'<br /><br />A wise Japanese proverb says: \\"He who tells does not know; for he who knows would never tell.\\" Even a year or more later, that notion protects the safety and lives of the related warriors; and their families. I can't believe that any Navy SEAL would ever think of taking such a chance.<br /><br />The factual raid violated a host of international laws and treaties - mandating silence, just to evade a broad spectrum of legal liabilities; ala the trial of Captain William Calley and the Viet Nam \\"Mai Lai massacre.\\"<br /><br />The bin Laden compound residents were described as being able to see in the supposed darkness, children remained calm amidst explosions and gunfire, bin Laden's body didn't fall where it should have, there was no description of the realistically expected blood spatter - with the exit wound of his supposed head wound described as \\"collapsed;\\" instead of exploded.\\" An amateur \\"CSI\\" actor would never make that mistake.<br /><br />The author's description of the first helicopters crash defies the factual ability of human perception; relative to the brief time of a factual crash experience - as described. The description of the second helicopter's low-fuel status didn't fit a factual 'insider's' reality - either in the book or the associated \\"60 Minutes\\" presentation.<br /><br />Combat excursions leave vivid sensory memories, including unique sounds and odors. In the vicinity of helicopters, you don't hear helicopter 'engines;' you hear the distinct sound of their rotor blades.<br /><br />Worse, yesterday's (fanatic) \\"Islamic terrorism\\" is today's fanatic Islamic revenge. Popularizing the raid could easily produce more American deaths abroad; or on U.S soil, in consequence.<br /><br />Enough said; I just can't buy into the account.<br /><br />Fact or fiction, prostituting the events of 9/11/2001 is pure sickness; by anyone who elects to do so - including Obama.
B0058YPL66|3.0|You know that thing they do in soap operas where things drag on for episode after episode and although the audience knows exactly what's going on, the characters don't seem to be able to figure anything out? Time after time, they almost figure something out or they get a tiny piece of the puzzle...and something thwarts them at the last second? You watch the villains hatch and carry out scheme after scheme on the clueless victims, or sometimes the \\"good\\" characters bully the \\"villains\\" into becoming what they are. You just want the story to progress instead of almost progressing over and over? You start to feel almost angry that the \\"heroes\\" are so clueless or frustrated that they can't catch a break. You keep watching because you really want to see how interesting and dramatic it gets when everything is out in the open...but it doesn't happen...That's how this series gets in Season 1.<br />I started off really liking this. Until I just got frustrated.<br />It's about a woman, a bounty hunter who gets tracked down by the kid she gave up for adoption. He takes her back to a town cursed by an evil queen where fairy tale characters from another world have lost their memories and are living out new lives. It's addictive and suspenseful. Fairytales are re-spun and re-told. Some good, some not.. Snow White and her Prince have a very different version of the story here, that is interesting and unique. Snow White is a thief and a bandit that tries to rob the prince and then...but in the cursed world, the Prince (without his memory) is a complete tool. He lies to Snow White and breaks her heart over and over, dating two women at once. The main character refuses to believe in the curse no matter how much proof she gets. Beauty and the Beast is turned into a farce with Belle falling in love with old evil man Rumplestillskin. The episodes story switches between the cursed town in present time, and telling background stories from the past fairy tail land to introduce new characters and reveal more of the background on them. Which is very well calculated and enjoyable to watch.<br />However...<br />Time and time again both villain characters control every aspect of things so that just when you think the truth is coming out...something happens and it's back to everyone being in the dark and clueless. It happens in the present time and in the fairy tale past and it gets old fast. Example...after Snow is about to go to the Prince(in fairy tale past), the king convinces her to lie to save his life and walk away. After several more JUST misses, it is beyond annoying. It is building a story about how they have overcome so much to be together, but after it keeps happening over and over, it stops being believable. AGAIN? Really?<br />FORTUNATELY I was able to skip from episode 8 or so to reading episode summaries and then straight to the season finale where the truth is revealed. Now that the truth is out I can watch season 2, but the middle episodes just drag on and make you want to bang your head against a wall in frustration! Here is hoping they don't make the same mistake twice! Just as the pay-off comes...no, sorry guys back to the beginning and 3 more episodes going in circles until they might almost figure out a clue to go forwards.<br />If you dislike soap operas, and you like the show and the story, try the same route I did, but maybe a little sooner. Had I done that, I might not be trying to get over a huge dislike for the Prince who they made into a cheater and liar, and then magically morphed him into a hero again in the end. But if these characters are part their fairy tale selves and part the new modern cursed versions with no memories...it still makes the Prince a tool afterwards.<br /><br />UPDATE: I really liked Season 2. Struggle through and keep watching!rs and reveal more of the background on them. Which is very well calculated and enjoyable to watch.<br />However...<br />Time and time again both villain characters control every aspect of things so that just when you think the truth is coming out...something happens and it's back to everyone being in the dark and clueless. It happens in the present time and in the fairy tale past and it gets old fast. Example...after Snow is about to go to the Prince(in fairy tale past), the king convinces her to lie to save his life and walk away. After several more JUST misses, it is beyond annoying. It is building a story about how they have overcome so much to be together, but after it keeps happening over and over, it stops being believable. AGAIN? Really?<br />FORTUNATELY I was able to skip from episode 8 or so to reading episode summaries and then straight to the season finale where the truth is revealed. Now that the truth is out I can watch season 2, but the middle episodes just drag on and make you want to bang your head against a wall in frustration!

B006OOHYIC|5.0|Definitely lives up to the first one. The Portal 2 to its Portal. Glad I got it free, but I'd totally pay the dollar!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|So exciting to see one of my favorite fair and carnival games on my kindle! now i can enjoy it sny time i want to and i dont even have to insert quarters! a must play for all ages!
B001QXE0OC|4.0|Many of these tracks are a lot of fun and there is only a few filler ones. I generally like the pop rock tracks more because of the guitars and drums but some of the dancier stuff isn't that bad either. Influences for the album were labelmate Demi Lovato, the dance queen of 2008 Lady Gaga and the love-her-or-hate-her type, Avril Lavigne. \\"Naturally\\" is the best dance pop track here. The title track \\"Kiss & Tell\\", \\"Falling Down\\", \\"As A Blonde\\" and \\"I Promise You\\" are the other standouts. If you're a Disney music fan and haven't checked this out yet, I'd advise you to. If there was any problems with the material here it's that the lyrics generally lack depth. However, knowing that she was only 17/18 when this came out, she's signed to Hollywood Records and only co-wrote a single track on her debut shows that there's still time for her to sing about heavier subjects. For now, the ballads will do. Also, Selena isn't the most capable singer out there but with studio trickery and auto-tuning she sounds OK.<br /><br />4.1 stars.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use this app on both my HTC Inspire phone &amp; my Kindle Fire and it works great on either one! I haven't really had any major issues with it. The only thing I'd add would be a way to edit, rearrange &amp; set the cover picture for my boards, as you can using the Internet. Otherwise, I love it!
B001DU8T6I|5.0|I like this album a lot. I heard her third one first but this one is better. All of the songs are good. At times she goes out of her vocal range and hits notes that come off as shrieky. Generally though she avoids that.<br /><br />Anyway, many of these tracks are fun but some of the highlights are the ballad \\"Don't Forget\\" which is a track about a relationship that came to a screeching halt and the unforgettable \\"La La Land\\" which I'd award a perfect 5 in the nature of the album itself. There are a bunch of upbeat songs on the record. The main thing I like about this album is that it's filled with pop rock anthems. The themes are teen-oriented issues and such. Much better than Selena Gomez's first album. Mostly because it can be taken a bit more seriously and Demi's voice is leagues better. A very good album in the vein of Kelly Clarkson's [[ASIN:B00064ADRK Breakaway]] or Ashlee Simpson's [[ASIN:B0002GMSC0 Autobiography]] but with an overall lighter approach and feel. Completely recommended and then some.<br /><br />The Deluxe version is the one I bought and it's worth it. It has alternate cover art which is darker and features Demi in a more feminine light. The album name is nowhere to be found on the front of the cover. It just says Demi Lovato on the cover. The extras include behind the scene stuff with Demi and the Jonas Brothers goofing off, short making of's for a music video or two and photos. Overall, I think it's a much better purchase than the standard edition.<br /><br />4.6 stars.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Love this app! Challenging, yet not impossible like similar apps. Haven't been able to put my phone down for days!
B005EZJ3MW|4.0|It's the perfect blend of vulnerability and catchiness. One of the best Disney singles to come out in 2012. I wish more of the album was more like it. The first time I heard Demi sing I was kinda shocked. This little girl had a big voice. I was watching Youtube and she was singing The National Anthem. Found out girl could blow. But I haven't really found anything that she sung (single-wise) that I liked until this album's latest single, \\"Give Your Heart A Break\\". Now I don't know much of her music but this pop song is fun.<br /><br />The beginning of the album is alright. Track 3 with Iyaz, \\"You're My Only Shorty\\" is good. Even better was \\"Together\\" featuring Jason Derulo (I was shocked at this cause I don't really care for his solo material). Other tracks that stuck out in a good way are \\"In Real Life\\" and the vocally riffy \\"My Love Is Like A Star\\" where Demi shows off her beautiful range that I never knew she had. I adore this track and she sounds like Blackground recording artist JoJo here.<br /><br />All in all, this album is more emotional than party which I appreciated but also found surprising since she worked with the likes of Timbaland and such. I do like the album enough to now want to purchase it. Some of the songs are growing on me however. They just aren't as immediate as on her first album.<br /><br />4.3 stars.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I have read all three of hers and love them. Very twisted and not for the person who doesn't like \\"dark\\" reading. Not your traditional heroine. The entire cast of every book seems totally twisted. Good reading!
B004OZZ624|5.0|At first I was going to give this movie 4 stars because it drags a little for awhile, but then I realized that was a good thing, to show how long it took John Brennan to pull off what he was trying to do. (trying not to spoil it lol)  I have always loved Russell Crowe, even in movies that I didn't like. He's one of our best actors in my opinion, and this movie is the best of both worlds:  a good actor in a good role!<br /><br />I've always loved Jason Beghe, too, and he it excellent in his role.  And it was really nice to see Brian Dennehy even in a small role.  I don't think he said more than 20 words in the whole movie, but he was great!  If you like intense movies, then this one is for you--- just get through the slow parts, (especially in the first hour) and you won't regret it!  Two thumbs up.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I have read all three of hers and they are all phenomenal. They are not for the faint of heart or those looking for a traditional heroine. All of her cast is broken in some way. Buy it!
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Because I didn't read the book, some parts were hard to understand. Very interesting story. Looking forward seeing the next part.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this site.  It has a little bit of every thing.  Can't seem to get enough of browsing the pins.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I liked this book, I liked the romance part with Peeta a lot.<br />I was interested enough to immediately read part 3, which was<br />also good, but in my opinion, the least enjoyable of the three<br />books.<br />I think part 2 is very much worth reading if you enjoyed<br />part 1 and want to carry on in the story.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I have read many of the impassioned reviews on Amazon and I do not agree with most. However, I do appreciate the courage it took to lead the author down the path he took starting when he was a boy. The author's words and motives ring true in my ears. I have a feeling that many of the loudest, most outraged reviewers are doing so from a  different place than where the author came from (you know who you are). I am so grateful that we have men (and women) who have given so much in the defense of my country, my family, and me. My sincere thanks also goes out to those who are still in the fight. Your continued sacrifices are not lost on me and mine.<br /><br />My sincere hope is that the Pentagon reconciles its position and the proceeds from the work can and will go to those who are the most needy. I submit this review in part, on behalf on my friends and co-workers who have bought and read the book too. I will continue to recommend this book to others.<br /><br />I also have to say one final thing, thank you for not taking the reader back through BUDS. I/we get it, it was very hard, you were cold, wet, sandy, and it defines who you are, but hey Bro, that space has already been explored...<br /><br />On a serious note, once again thank you and take care.
0307730697|5.0|Fearless is my new favorite biography. Navy SEAL Operator Adam Brown was a fascinating and inspiring person and Blehm's writing captivates Adam's story thoroughly and excellently. I was quickly caught up into the details and struggles of Adam's early life, and inspired and awed by his motivation, boldness, and extreme love for God and life in his later years. Adam Brown's progression of faith and his testimony in Jesus Christ is, in fact, a large part of his story and one of the aspects I deeply connected with.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the glance into the inner workings of the Navy SEALs and was surprised by how much the author was able to publicly share regarding various missions and SEAL life. I've never been a part of a military community or given much thought into military life, and I felt that this book helped me to consider that part of my country in a deeper way.<br /><br />This is a very action oriented story with a good amount of humor, but also a very emotional one--and I'm not a terribly emotional reader. I found that although I was prepared for Adam's heroic death to be described at some point within the book, I couldn't help but sob when the events unfolded. It's a touching biography and will especially be appreciated within the Christian community.<br /><br />I received a complimentary copy of this book from WaterBrook Multnomah.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|Another great Reacher book.  You should really start at the beginning of the series, but this is a great place to start too.

B008YI91HS|5.0|I had been seen this movie 10 years ago. I wanted to watch this movie with my kids becuase they didn't watch this movie before. my kids liked the movie. This is very good family movie. The picture quality of instant moive is very good and I would recommend to watch this movie, who have not been before, purticulary children.
B008RV5K5E|4.0|I couldn't have been more excited when I heard they were going to attempt this.  With Bruce Timm on board, I was sure they could do it justice.  Does it live up to what I consider the best Batman story ever told?  Well.... Yes and no.<br /><br />Ever since the Batman Animated series, whenever I read a Batman comic, I can only hear one voice. To me Kevin Conroy is the definitive voice of Batman.  I'm not sure why he hasn't been utilized in a lot of these DC comic movies or in the Young Justice series.  Every recent animation has me saying \\"It would be better with Kevin Conroy!\\"  I tried not to let this get to me, but this Batman sounds a lot like Bane in the new Batman movie.  That or Billy Zane holding in a huge dump!<br /><br />Let me start with the positives!  DC animated movies always have stellar animation.  This is no exception.  They mimic the comic style of the source material perfectly.  It was exhilarating seeing Frank Miller's pencils come to life.  The art is definately the high point.  The script does a very good job adapting the comic.  There are extra scenes and it is out of order a little from the comic, but all in all it was very good.<br /><br />This movie left me excited for the conclusion!  I'm glad they did it justice and spread it over 2 movies so they can cover everything.  This is a great way to introduce people to The Dark Knight Returns and hopefully they go and read the comics.  His Batman Year One was integral to the recent Batman Movies.  300 and Sin City movies were incredibly well done and it was all due to staying true to the source material.  This is a lesson all movie makers need to take note of.  Just use the source material and don't \\"Michael Bay\\" your movie!  This is something this movie should have done.<br /><br />Something started bothering me half way through and I couldn't put my finger on it.  It was only until my girlfriend start asking me: \\"why would Batman do this or that? \\"What is he thinking?\\" \\"What does that mean?\\" that it hit me.  There was no patented Frank Miller inner monlogue in the script!  I have read the comic hundreds of times and I think because of this, I was correcting it on my own.  The Sin City movie nailed it, this movie ignored it.<br /><br />This is as close to having a movie adaptation you are ever going to see, it's just to bad that they screwed up on something so crucial.  If you can ignore the bad voice acting for Batman and forgive the lack of inner monologue (or fill it in yourself) this is definately worth checking out!  Since so much is dead on and not all the voice acting is bad, I still give it a 4/5!
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book was worth reading, great book very informative included a great workout plan and helped with overall healthy and lifting mentality
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I was very impressed by the clean language in this book. They could have made this very brutal and gory, but chose the higher path. I applaude the author and publishers.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was excited to read this book after all the hype about how steamy it was and that it was the summers best guilty pleasure.  I have to admit I was searching for a bit of fluff with some parts that would make me flush and was satisfied with the graphic scenes.  Unfortunately, that's were the merits of this book stop.  It becomes repetitive and infuriating in equal parts.  Ana is at once a feminist not wanting to have a relationship where she is given gifts since it makes her feel like a prostitute but submits herself to a relationship where one of the expectations is that she has no voice.  It is this contradiction that James feels to repeat over and over and over again that really ruins some of the excitement of the novel.  It is not written well enough to be more than a piece of smutty fluff but James really attempts to make conflict in her character.  It just doesn't work.  Perhaps if Ana had been given more of a personality so the conflict could be understood, or even if Ana stopped her internal crying about the situation and finally make a definitive choice it would be acceptable.  I just find it odd that she would let herself feel cheap by lavish gifts but not by his treatment of her until the very end of the book.<br /><br />Beyond the above complaint, I just wish James had given us a heroine with more qualities and flaws than Ana possessed.  The \\"I don't know I'm beautiful\\" act is so old and overdone.  No, not everyone is a beauty and modesty is great, but after going into so many minute details of Christians gorgeous, godlike body it would be great for Ana to at least recognize that she is pretty.  The fact that she has multiple men asking her out should give her a clue.  I know that this started as a fan fiction, but the Bella similarities really put me off since it's such a one-dimensional character.  James would have done better to give Ana a bit of a personality, recognize her good points, and maybe have a flaw beyond clumsiness.  In my mind clumsiness never really is a deal breaker in most friendships or relationships, so it would be nice if she was sarcastic or shy to a fault, etc, etc.  Just anything that made her seem more like a normal, well rounded individual.  For heaven's sake she has a mother that remarried multiple times, grew up with a step dad, is going a school that (in real life) is in a horrible part of town, you would think that she would have a bit more to her from her life situations.<br /><br />I will end by saying the one thing that kept me reading was the intrigue around Christian's past.  I love things involving the human mind and psychology especially after childhood traumas.  I think that part was very real and that he would be very turbulent in his emotions.  If James can create a character like that I believe the protagonist could easily had as much depth (depth doesn't have to be something crazy, normal people have depth).  I will probably watch for more novels outside of the Shades series since I think she could do much better, but don't buy this book and think that it will shock you continually or keep you interested past the first few steamy scenes.never really is a deal breaker in most friendships or relationships, so it would be nice if she was sarcastic or shy to a fault, etc, etc.  Just anything that made her seem more like a normal, well rounded individual.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was excited to start reading the final book of the Hunger Games.  The book did start off a little slow and I was bored until I got about a quarter of the way through.  Of course, at that point, I couldn't put the book down because I was anxious to find out what would happen at every turn of the page.  I enjoyed the different twists along the way, because no one wants to really know what happens at the end before you get there, right? I was really curious on how this would end, but Suzanne Collins did a really good job in pulling all three books together and then satisfying our curiosity with a great ending.

B005LAJ1H2|5.0|The second season (12 episodes) of Boardwalk Empire remind us all that great writing, great plots and a great cast can make for television drama that we cannot get enough of. In this case, Season 2 of Boardwalk Empire meets and exceeds every expectation that I would have after watching the first season. Nucky Thompson (Steve Buscemi) now fights for control of Atlantic City and the liquor empire. The cast of characters he has to deal with from Chalky White, to Leo Rothstein, to corrupt senators, judges, lawyers, family (his brother, Eli, to a Treasury Agent (Van Aulden) and acquaintances, it will be a huge time for Nucky Thompson and a time of danger as Prohibition ruled the nation while a nation of thirsty drinkers continue to fuel the wars over alcohol.<br /><br />Every episode is outstanding. I won't \\"spoil\\" who dies in Season 2. The reality is that a LOT of people die in Season 2 because it had to happen. The show's central theme continues to be the fact that prohibition made better mobsters than ever before and it meant that money bought anything and everything so that the alcohol would flow despite the laws against it in the early 1920s.<br /><br />Season 2 ends with a wild finish. Losing a character or two from Season 2 will make for an intersting third season (and hopefully further seasons after that!), but with this cast, the writing and the plot(s) I know the series is going the right direction. What I don't understand is why this show was not nomianted for more Emmys as the cast was great. That is truly an injustice to this series.

B007L3BMGA|5.0|I am not into erotica but this book was something else plus. I love romance and this book had it all.  It was repetitive in as far as sex was concerned but you need to look beyond that to the beautiful love story.  After re-reading this book as well as book two and three I was able to see a love story worthly of other classics, and one day this will be a classic.  The two main characters were very loveable, even with all Christian's emotional baggege you could not help but love him.  Anastasia was everything I love in a heroine, beautiful and storng, truly an amazing young lady. The writing was easy read and I love up-to-date vocabulary. Highly entertaining book.

B005S9EJ14|5.0|After seeing the film the week of its release, I waited for [[ASIN:B005S9EJ14 The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel]] to become available on DVD, and had to place an order for this true gem. My immediate reaction had been that this is a movie that I wanted to see over and again, if just for the pure pleasure in seeing people who can prove that it's good to be over sixty and be able to explore new horizons. For me, this is unquestionably one of the best movies of the year.<br /><br />Director John Madden's comedy about English retirees in India is a fascinating mix of both the familiar and the exotic. Ol Parker's screenplay is an adaptation from British author Deborah Moggach's book [[ASIN:0701176202 These Foolish Things]] (2004), and the casting is true perfection. It begins in the UK with brief sketches of seven British senior citizens, which sets the stage.<br /><br />We find Evelyn Greenslade (Judi Dench) on the phone in her London flat, trying to communicate with a robotic operator at an Indian call center. She's a recent widow and is forced to sell her home after learning that her deceased husband had misused their life savings. It's Evelyn's blog entries, read aloud as narrative, that set the film's timeline.<br /><br />There's Muriel Donnelly (Maggie Smith), a xenophobic, crabby shrew, a never-married retired housekeeper bound to her wheelchair. She needs a hip replacement, and makes the trip because in India the surgery will be cheaper and doesn't require a month long wait. Douglas and Jean Ainslie (Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton) are an argumentative couple that sank their nest egg into their daughter's failing start-up company.<br /><br />Madge Hardcastle (Celia Imrie) and Norman Cousins (Ronald Pickup) are two singles looking for a change from the older British dating scene. Graham Dashwood (Tom Wilkinson) is a retired judge with a guilty past who grew up in Jaipur, and is returning there for the first time since his youth.<br /><br />All seven are drawn to \\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the elderly and beautiful\\" in Jaipur, India, based on an advertisement inspired more by the proprietors' hopes than on reality. The seven seniors travel to India, and as we find out, the hotel is anything but the Best or Exotic.<br /><br />It's here at the Marigold Hotel that they meet their host, Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel), a naïve, completely disorganized yet highly enthusiastic young man. Must admit that I had to stifle my laughter in the theater and again when viewing the DVD, watching Sonny trying to explain to his guests that the hotel has no working telephones and that some rooms are without doors, something that had been neglected ahead of time. He is the film's comic lead, and his often-hyperactive performance often borders on pure slapstick. His exclamation was perfect:<br /><br />\\"Everything will be all right in the end... if it's not all right then it's not the end.\\"<br /><br />Sonny is under extreme pressure from his arrogant, domineering mother to give up the hotel as a lost cause and go along with an arranged marriage in Delhi. But complicating matters, Sonny is in love with Sunaina (Tena Desae), a call center worker. It gets interesting (and a bit ironic) when Evelyn takes a job in the call center instructing the workers how to speak to British people on the phone... classic Judi Dench.<br /><br />Watching Muriel's gradual transformation from a racist and crabby shrew to a caring and sensitive woman may have stretched credibility a bit. But considering the never-married housekeeper background of her character, it's something that few besides Maggie Smith could pull off so well.<br /><br />The overall plot is beautifully interwoven with the subplots, and viewers will be treated to some mild surprises. Without dropping any spoilers, watch for Douglas (Bill Nighy) having a blast exploring the nearby temples and such, yet that does have its results with his wife. The antics of Madge (Celia Imrie) and Norman (Ronald Pickup)in their quests for romance are hilarious in parts. Graham (Tom Wilkinson) offers a touching performance on many levels as he proceeds with his personal quest.<br /><br />If there was any disappointment at all for this viewer, it was the hope that somewhere and at some point, Bill Nighy would break out of playing his role as a browbeaten husband and burst into that mad aging rocker that he did to well in [[ASIN:B00005JMFQ Love Actually]], but we can't have everything.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B005S9EJ14 The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel]] is lively, irreverent and enjoyable when Maggie Smith and Penelope Wilton are doing their crabby senior citizen performances. It produces some real laughs and offers truly brilliant performances from a highly experienced cast. Peppered with its pungent illustration of Jaipur's jam-packed streets and the rest of the scenery, it's a heartwarming, captivating and even inspiring leisurely paced comedy. Its optimism and claim that it's never too late to leave your comfort zone and explore new horizons makes it a joy for all except diehard gerontophobics.<br /><br />9/24/2012in their quests for romance are hilarious in parts.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I think I was a little spoiled by all the hype surrounding the book and the movie, so it fell a little short of expectations - just not the page-turner I hoped it would be.  Still, it's a well-written, gripping story and for me, at least, the book is way more worth your time than the movie.
B000002KKC|4.0|The big question is however,  did it pay off?  Well yes and no.  Tusk found Fleetwood Mac at their most experimental and downright bizarre.  I can just imagine what the executives at Warner Brothers thought when the band came in to introduce thier new single.  What must have gone through thier heads when the opening tribal drums of Tusk came pounding through the speakers,  followed by an all out horn section by the USC marching band.  This was not a very commercial sounding peice of music.  After the California singer songwriter pop rock that was Rumours,  an album Like Tusk would prove to be a huge risk.  This was a time when Fleetwood Mac was the biggest band on the planet so changing a winning formula may have not been the best move.  If the tone of Rumours was light and shadows,  I would have to say the tone of Tusk was laid back and frenetic.  To styles that are at complete oppisites of the spectrum.  Tusk was definately Lindsay Buckinghams brain child.  He more or less threatened to leave the band if he felt his creativity was being stifled.  I think that his other band mates new he was an intregal part of the Fleewtood Mac sound and an exeptional producer as well as lead guitarist.  They really ended up bending over backwards to appease him and the direction he wanted to take the band.  Mick Espeacially wanted to do something more in the vain og the \\"Short Tall\\" album and rumours, however, Buckinghams strong and sometimes agressive personality would end up having the last say.  Buckinghams obssesive producing techniques on this album are almost the stuff of legend,  no suprise he was a huge fan of the similarly obsessive Brian Wilson.  This Album has a definate Beach Boys Vibe to it in spots as far as production goes.  The album itself is hit and miss.  It is thier longest album but certainly not thier best.  Nicks undoubtatly has the strongest material on Tusk.  Sara is a Fleetwood Mac classic,  Storms another Nicks song is just as emotive and achingly beautiful.  Her vocals on these tracks are some of her best and that is saying alot.  Beautiful Child is not a very well known Nicks number but it is one of my favorites from this album.  It is truly haunting and a bit strange lyrically.  When her and Mcvie share harmonies toward the end of this song and John mcvies bass kick in it gives me chills every time.  Christine has some solid material on here but not quite up to par with some of her previous numbers.  Think about me was released as a single and does have a good uplifting vibe to it.  Over and Over is very laid back and kind of trails off toward the end almost giving it an unfinished vibe.  Brown Eyes is a truly strange take on the Van Morrison number complete with the Sha La Las thrown in.  This is not a cover of the Morrison song,  just a reinterpretaion I would say.  Than we have the man responsible.  Buckingham delvers some of the most offbeat songs on this album than problaly any other he has ever done with the band.  Sometimes it really works,  I know Im Not Wrong with its joyous accordian and guitar soloing is a song I really enjoy.  The title track Tusk is a masterpiece and unlike anything else that was on the radio at the time.  Those are the highlights that make Tusk worth checking out.  I just dont think it would be the first album I would recommened for someone new to the band.  I have to admit though, its an album that grows on you over time.  The more I listen to it, the more I enjoy it.
0375869026|5.0|As the parent, I was blown away by this book. I can't recall reading something in recent memory that really caused me to look at my relationship with others and the world in a whole new way as did Ms. Palacio's ambitious work. And the teachable moments this book provides are all about friendship and empathy. While Auggie's facial features are the catalyst for the story, it could have been a learning disability, poverty, you name it, the yearning to belong and be accepted just simply for who you are, not what you are, is universal. My son groused about reading this, but once he got into, he couldn't put it down. Not only did this book provide a LOT of great family discussion, but I can see the very real impact it made on my son and resulting more empathic approach to other kids and his friendships. The part of the book that is told from Auggie's point of view are definitely the most incredible, interesting and enlightening, and not to take away from the other parts as told from the point of view of the others, but the essence of Auggie's desire is what we all desire. Well done, Ms. Palacio!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this app. I would change a couple of things but, for the overall effect its works beautifully. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone ;)
B007SGM084|5.0|I'm more of a mystery/thriller and not much a \\"romance\\" type person so I couldn't figure out what the all the scuttle was about...  Finally, a trusted friend told me I \\"HAVE TO READ IT!\\".  The first book is sex sex sex, but it intrigued me (((blush))) so I kept reading.  WOW!  What an experience!  I couldn't stop reading!  I've read a lot (A LOT A LOT) of books in my life, but this one is by far my favorite!  I'm actually kind of sad that I'm finished.  To the folks that say women's lib is taking a step back, that's BS!  If you keep reading into books 2 and 3, you see what a strong woman Ana actually is and there is NOTHING wrong with enjoying your partner and their \\"kinky ___ery\\".  Just sayin. Cheers to Ms. James!
B005ML9YOU|5.0|If you want to read all of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, you can't go wrong with this. The books and all the articles, sixty of them, in one easy to read place.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this is a great app, and is definatley recommended  for anyone looking for a fun time! If you concentrate and take your time, you can gain a lot of points!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I cannot put this book down. There are so many interlocking threads that could be indepedent tales themselves.  The books easily out-do the HBO series.  Watch the shows after you read.
B0072OFM28|3.0|I watched \\"Spartacus; the First Season and, while recognizing that it was completely 'over-the-top', rather enjoyed it for what it was.  It was a barely historical drama of ancient, terrible, oftentimes ridiculous, behavior.  The 'Second Season' has all of the defects of the 'First Season' and few of its---aaahhhh---virtues.  It is nonstop slaughter and sexual depravity.  Skin is torn, skulls cleaved, limbs hacked off, abdomens impaled, necks pierced, intestines drawn out ad infinitum.  Blood splashes everywhere, especially on the camera lens.<br /><br />Now all of these things might be regarded as semi-artistic but the video techniques for demonstrating combat and violence leave a LOT to be desired.  There is a cartoonish nature to the whole thing.  The sex scenes, primarily soldier/gladiator orgies [were gladiators permitted to 'spend' themselves in orgies?], are so gross as to be almost funny.  Brutal sex is often terminated by Spartacus breaking up the party with a spear or sword.<br /><br />Oh.  Worst of All.  By far, the worst of all, is the audio on my Amazon DVD.  The voices as so fuzzy and muffled that I had to attempt to figure out the story from the action.  Probably I would have felt better about the film, even with its historically thin premise, had I been able to follow the dialogue.
B008602KQI|2.0|I read the Hunger Games long before I saw the movie.  The premise was the sort I loved as a young man but seems more implausible today.  Nonetheless I forced myself to \\"get into it\\" and enjoyed the book adequately enough.  But because of the restrictions forced by a movie of about two hours, hardly any book can be presented on screen in its entirety.  And, in the case of Hunger Games, that restriction is fatal.  Too much like using a cartoon strip to depict War and Peace.  So if you stay away from the book, maybe the movie is passable (for example, I loved Avatar).  But Hunger Games is a story that requires more depth than a movie can hold.
B004T6IBNY|4.0|Fun! It is like the old time pinball games in the arcade. Interesting! Does provide a bit of a challenge. Would recommend it to friends.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|I'm a Christopher Hitchens fan (bordering on fanatic) and I'm trying to read everything he's written.  Not making great progress because I keep doubling back, e.g., just started re-reading God is not Great.  Mortality is certainly not his seminal work, but considering the conditions under which it was written, still pretty remarkable and worth the short time required to experience his craftsmanship one last time.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|lot of hide and find,  lotta of different scenes .  some good graphics kept the game interesting.  unexpected scenes were interesting too.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|the game is captivating and as frustrating as the real thing<br />the prizes and puzzles added make it more fun
B007V5CF5K|5.0|This game has excellent graphics. The attention to detail is rather amazing, especially considering the almost nonexistent price. I hope the gameplay stays this spectacular!!
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Quick read, but held my interest.  I would read more by this author. Lots of action with believable characters.  I would recommend for almost anyone.
B007V693YK|2.0|As the others have said, it will not sync with music and tab. Frustrating to say the least. Might as well use the web site from my kindle fire.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Really enjoyed all three books. I know I will re-read them again in the near future.I could not wait to turn the next page.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's solitaire. With customizable background and card backs, it lets you add a little personality. Predictably, ads are super annoying, especially the repeated video ads, but when aren't they?
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I bought this for my husband to read as he is a great admirer of the Navy Seals and all of the work they do to protect our country.  He said this was written with great detail, but did not give away any information that could be considered as \\"classified\\".  He was glad he had an opportunity to read it !
B005IQZB14|5.0|For those that want an adventure without leaving their living room and now it feels like to be out among nature.
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|I saw this movie quite some time ago and I had really enjoyed it then. I one day mentioned it to my wife and she indicated she would like to see it, I told her that the odds of finding it again were pretty slight. The first place I decided to look was of course Amazon.com and I was truly surprises and delighted to find it almost immediately. It arrived in a timely manner and my wife and I watched it that same night. She enjoyed it greatly and I enjoyed it even more the second time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|great when I was playing multiplayer my friend joined my game and his person of me was realllly slow can u fix that and put in some enderman thanks ;)
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book rocks! I can't wait for the movie. An awesome series that is spell binding. Give me the next book.
B00932A2MC|5.0|I know this movie was not a blockbuster at the theatre BUT that is a real shame because a lot of folks missed out. I saw an interview with Director Peter Berg where he explained that he used this movie as a tribute to our veterans and the men and women currently serving. Knowing that before I watched the movie probably helped me to view some scenes differently. Where I might have thought a scene was lame or corny I instead thought the scene was awesomely corny!<br /><br />I watched this movie with my 21yr old son. By the end we were both cheering and laughing at how, even though this is in no way an award winning film, it had just become a favorite! This movie is the best kind of entertainment! Total escapism that leaves you feeling happy when its done. That doesn't happen often these days! So if your looking to escape for a couple of hours and you can leave your expectations \\"at the door\\" then this is the film for you.<br /><br />I didn't give this film 5 stars for flawless directing, Oscar winning acting, or extraordinary writing. I gave it 5 stars for being true, honest entertainment that is uplifting, and fun, and exciting, and left me in the best mood I've been in for years after watching a movie!
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I hesitated buying Kathy Reich's latest novel Bones are forever because her conclusions are soooooo predictable: she's on the cusp of solving the mystery when the bad guy knocks her out, she wakes up groggy and bound in some way, breaks free and fights her assailant for a few brief minutes before being rescued by Ryan or another law enforcement officer she is either currently dating or has dated in the past...<br /><br />Its gotten so bad that if you have read her previous novels, you can spot that one specific sentence which actually gives away when the bad guy is going to \\"unexpectedly\\" hit her from behind (its when she has just figured it out in her head and is about to explain it to us). I closed the book and didnt come back to it until a few days later because I was miffed at being taken for granted by the author like that.<br /><br />The writing is good, witty, topics are well researched, but the structure is depressingly trite. A good read if its the first time you reach Kathy Reich. A predictable read otherwise.
0345803485|5.0|This book had me on the edge of my seat. I have never in my life read a book from cover to cover..THIS WAS A 1st for me!! I have already purched book two and three as well. Such a great story! I am very please and excited to read the trilogy.<br /><br />best~<br />L. Taylor

It is full of excitement, page after page.  I am a huge fan!  And kudos to HBO for creating a series that brings the books to life!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really love this app, you can set daily readings and reminders. You can also highlight a verse in a chapter. It also have other translations if you wish to read a more clearer translation.
B008X9Z37A|3.0|I wanted to protect my kindle but not spend a ton of money. For the amount i paid i wished it was a little bit sturdier but it holds my kindle with the usual 4 corner, they just seem a little flimsy. It did protect my kindle from a small drop which saved me from a heart attack. And most of all i really wish i had a strap to keep the cover closed because i think I might have to resort to a rubber band
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Iloved this book! Not only do the sex scenes sizzle, but the story line was good too. I read all three and they just keep getting better
B000V4UFZK|5.0|It's hard-even for me-to believe that I haven't watched this until very recently, and it's only a couple months before I turn 26. Yeah, it was time for me to get updated and watch something good. I'm sorry, this is Poltergeist we're talking about here- trippin' awesome! In an interview he had, Christian horror author Greg Mitchell explained how the original Fright Night was his number one favorite horror movie all time, even though it isn't terrifying, he loves it for all the small moments. Watching this, I realized what he meant, it has a great balance of not only small moments and big plot points, but also great emotional substance in each small moments and thought-provoking (and even the silly) dialogue. A little girl, the youngest in the family, during a storm, hears voices within a tv set and unknowingly warns that \\"They're here.\\" The way she says that not only is cute and sweet, but given the context, is also chilling. Then the weird stuff happens. Too bad the bird had to go (not the eldest daughter's \\"bird\\" either, that one was creative).<br />I wish I could go into much of what happens, but I had no idea what would actually happen, so I can't say much in case someone else (unbelievably) hasn't seen this yet either. Suffice it to say, though, that even paranormal researchers have caught the field day, and so does a psychic. In the small moments where nothing actually happens, there's earnest dialogue about certain mysteries of life in connection to what all is going on.<br />Toward the end, things get pretty intimate and human-like, but there's always a twist to things, aren't there? At least the final shot of the movie got me laughing good considering all that happened.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|OK so when I first started reading the fifty shades trilogy I was curious as to why everyone was making such a big deal. After the first chapter I was hooked. I loved the entire series. However I still do not see why so many people are against the books. I mean seriously men burning over two dozen of these books because they feel they can not live up to Christian Grey. Sure the book is full of hot, raw, and passionate sex. However, in my opinion and as a woman the attraction to these books is the fact that the man loved the woman unconditionally and had such a strong love for her that he was willing to change his entire life style to be with her and to become a better person. It is not always about sex in a relationship for a woman (this is in my opinion) it is about being wanted, loved, and desired and for the male to do what ever it takes to show her.
0345803485|2.0|It seems to me that most women enjoy a good love story, that's how I got hooked on Twilight.  This book was also recommended to me by a friend from church, so I was surprised to be find sex every five pages once we hit the third chapter (at least, that's what I recall).  I got sucked in quickly, and my poor family lost me for the weekend.  I had up and down feelings about it, but really couldn't put it down.  Once I finished it, I decided to put at least a week between the first and second books.  The more time I put between me and it, the more I lost interest in reading the other two. I really could care less about the BDSM. When the summary mentioned a dark secret, I found the S&M to be a \\"blah\\" surprise.  There's just nothing but sex and \\"romance\\".  Honestly, I'd rather pick up a Penthouse Forum, read two stories, and put it down for a couple weeks.  Maybe I'm just weird like that, but I either want to read a good, gripping story with a little sex sprinkled in, or just give me hard core sex and nothing else. I couldn't make it through the Twilight series, either.  I enjoyed Twilight, but New Moon was a drag, and I quit on chapter two.  I imagine Fifty Shades Darker to be similar, since the end of book one ended with a breakup.<br /><br />It just seems to me, especially since all three books were published at once instead of staggered out, that the books were written and published with the intention of raking in money (which it did), and not so much for the purpose of providing readers with something compelling to read.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I like to give short honest reviews. When I read a book/story its for the fun and love of reading.<br />Mile 81 is old school Stephen King, Nightshift, Nightmare & Dreamscape days old school. If you love King shorts you'll love this one.
B005XN31LY|5.0|For anyone who wants to catch up before Season 2 begins this month, I highly recommend downloading this to your Kindle Fire now!  It is so much fun trying to guess who the fairy tale characters are in the current time, and the show writers' development and flashbacks keep the viewer enthralled!
B007N5YY2K|5.0|I originally saw this film at a theater in 3D. It was my first 3D movie and my initial concerns of eye strain or other problem were baseless. I enjoyed so much I had to see it again in 2D via Amazon. If you have ever read and enjoyed a Tin Tin book, then this movie will be a delight to you. If not, you must see it anyway. It was amazing how they actually transformed the 2D characters into pseudo-reality and the 3D enhanced that amazement. It has been awhile since I read some of these graphic novels and the story seemed to combine at least two if not more books. I suspect there will be a sequel and I hope they do Explorers on the Moon.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like this a lot perhaps too much.  I find myself going on to play this more than any of my other games. I think I may be addicted!
B007T99ENE|2.0|This is not the Ian McEwan of Enduring Love, The Innocent, On Chesil Beach, or even, despite its melodramatic and overwrought quality, Atonement, which was still enjoyable, if over-rated. This is the Ian McEwan that wrote the awful, lazy, self-indulgent Amsterdam (why did such a boring, bland piece of work get the Booker?) and Saturday.<br />The characters are all equally unlikable and unbelievable. I could not relate to any of them, nor make sense of their actions, which seemed random and idiotic. The main character is thoroughly superficial, seeming to 'fall in love' with any man she sees in the most cliched ways. Literature is of course not meant to be 'real' nor should characters necessarily be 'likeable', but the reader should be able to suspend disbelief in order to be immersed in their world and taken along for the ride. This did not happen to me with Sweet Tooth, as the artificial, strained nature of the piece was apparent to me at all times.<br />Most unbearable were the frequent digressions into 'meta' sections on writing, with snippets of the 'books in the book' quoted ad nauseam. Not only are these turgid, ridiculous pieces of prose, they are also a regurgitation of cliches on what it is to write, what we talk about when we talk about writing etc., you get the drift. This is self-indulgent stuff written for the critics as it were, and they were immensely boring passages for me.<br />It seems that McEwan has attempted to be too clever by half with this novel, as instead of focusing on getting a message across through a powerful, robust narrative (i.e. telling a reasonable believable story with reasonable believable characters), he has tried to play around with heavy style effects and unsubtle irony, in order to produce a piece that is more about writing as a technique or practice, than about the pleasure of a story.<br />That is why Sweet Tooth will leave the saccharine flavour of mendacious writing in your mouth, and is best avoided.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|I found Defending Jacob to be a great quick read. A \\"whodunit\\" till the very last page. It makes one question themselves about what a killer actually looks like. Can your average teenager be a murderer? If your 14 year old son was accused of murder, how would you handle it? You love your child no matter what! Very interesting !!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is THE best book I have ever read!! And I don't just mean best ROMANCE novel, I mean BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ! Unlike other romance novels I have read, this one never got \\"annoying.\\" Of course there were the normal conflicts and ups and downs, but it was never straight up \\"annoying.\\" I would say that the ending was a little abrupt and maybe even a little choppy, but.. that's okay. The last chapter alone doesn't do any harm to the entire rest of the book being simply amazing. The characters were real. And I mean... REAL. Even the way that they spoke was real. It wasn't like I was.. well, reading a book.. it was as if I were hanging out with my friends. Jamie McGuire didn't hold back on this book, and I can't wait to read the sequel! I have to wait until April?! Ughhhh!! Hah :)

The reading plans can be used by anyone - there are two-year plans for those who want to take it in little chunks, as well as 90 day plans for those who like a faster pace, and several in between.  I have been doing the 90 day plan and find it challenging in a good way. It's a large chunk of reading each day, but you fly through the Bible!  Overall, this is an awesome tool and a great way to stay connected with the word when you're out and about!
0743243315|5.0|An unspoilt girl from the village, new bride Nazneen is brought to England to live in London's tower blocks. She stares out now at a very different village, through windows soiled by grime. Her husband finds her \\"satisfactory\\" and no one asks what she thinks. Meanwhile Nazneen's sister has married for love back in India, and no one seems to care what she thinks or experiences either.<br /><br />Clipping nostril hair and corns for her spouse, cooking meals, learning to live with neighbors who each in their own very different way accommodate to a new world, Nazneen dreams of helping her sister and of staying true to herself. Meanwhile her husband dreams of riches and returning home in state, while he lives in unfulfilled failure.<br /><br />Under the skin, whether it be burned away by acid and fire or rendered transparent through the eyes of an author who sees what lies beneath, we're all of us the same. Debates on Brick Lane as America's towers fall aren't so different from elsewhere in London, even if the debaters are mostly Muslim. Brick Lane's defeats as drug money flows, Brick Lane's lonely women at their sewing machines, and Brick Lane's disaffected youth all come to life... The tattoo woman hides her skin under pictures till the weight is too great, and Nazneen hides her soul under images of Fate. When Nazneen finally wakes to a lover's touch, will she be anything more than an unspoilt village girl after all these years?<br /><br />Filled with bitingly honest humor and searing pathos, Monica Ali's Brick Lane describes not only the immigrant experience, but also the belated coming of age of individuals and society, the lies we hide behind like colored tattoos, and the many layers that make up truth. A long, powerful, enthralling novel with a pleasing strength in its ending, this is a tale of culture with as message of self-determination and a musical score that will keep you longing for more.<br /><br />Disclosure: I borrowed a copy from a friend during my visit to England.to England.

B0084I9QIW|5.0|This DVD is a true treasure. Some have complained about the quality of the film, but it's just fine to me being that this was re-mastered from an old cassette tape.<br /><br />Michael looks gorgeous in this. He sounds a little winded at times but he still sounds good! I love the Smooth Criminal and Human Nature performances. And of course the Rock With You and Man in the MIrror performances as well.<br /><br />Not thrilled about the I Just Can't Stop Loving You performance, but it's not because of Michael, but because of Sheryl. Her voice leaves A LOT to be desired.<br /><br />His dancing is mesmerizing and I thoroughly enjoyed the musical break when musical director Greg Phillinganes and Co. were rocking out!!<br /><br />I was smiling from ear-to-ear when he introduced the backup singers, musicians and his dancers at the very end. He seemed so enthusiastic. HE really had an appreciation for those who worked with him.<br /><br />I LOVED THIS!!! And I encourage all MJ fans to get it!! It's a decent price and you will be thoroughly entertained!

B000FBFN1U|4.0|Rich and dense is the best way to review this whole book series.  A true love/hate let's get on with this type of novel.  I am really not sure what direction this is going.  About the time I think I know what to expect.... he kills off someone important.<br />I have to keep reading just to see how this thing will end.  So far... so good.
B0059A149C|5.0|This movie is an all time classic. It allows the viewer to get to know the crew before the mission beforehand. This adds to the overall experience entailed by this movie. Just awesome.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is enthralling. Amazingly well written. Although the cover does not imply a female protagonist the book centers around a young girl in Nazi Germany. Although the story is deeply personal to her it has implications that cross language and cultural barriers to impact readers everywhere.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|Fun movie for sure - lousy acting and flimsy plot but who cares?  It's a movie with Angelina climbing into the driver's seat with Nicolas Cage and mostly, that sexy beast Eleanor...Buy it for those two things alone!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was such a fun book to read! I bought this e-book while on vacation in Maui. (The \\"e-books\\" I had bought and planned to read were actually short stories and were easily finished in an evening)<br />I searched \\"what's popular\\" in Kindle, saw Gone Girl, downloaded the preview and was hooked!<br />After purchasing the full book my wife and I read together, (on the plane) or I would read to her when alone, (chicks love that).<br />There were several times while on the plane when we would both look at each other with our mouths hanging open in disbelief at some new twist or revelation.<br />As soon as we got home I ordered Gillian Flynns other 2 novels. Even if they are only half as good I'll be happy.

B003U9W3GM|5.0|Excellent reading. For those of us who received military training but never served in combat, it provides an insight into what could have happend.<br /><br />More to the point it did in fact happen to Sledge and his mates. They endured deprivation, extreme danger and observed death administered by a fanatical foe who gave no quarter - the principle of kill or be killed was rigidly applied.<br /><br />As a young boy living in Northern Australia in the 1940's I vividly recall American troops passing through this area. I also recall the bombing of parts of Northern Australia. Sledge and his US Marine mates, along with Australian troops, prevented the Japenese from invading Australia. Now I better understand the price these men paid in winning freedom.<br /><br />I salute these men!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|No zombies, beheadings, dismemberment, or speed records here.  Just a calming effect as you think your way thru each level.  Really cool.
B0011NVC98|4.0|Opinions vary regarding the quality of the 2007 film version of Beowulf, just as reactions to any film may vary.  However, there is an overwhelmingly large stance against the film as an educational tool by teachers across the nation.  Beowulf, one of the most important texts in the English language, tells the tale of an epic hero - a man guided by pride and loyalty to save men who need rescued from the beasts that lurk in the night.  Beowulf, the film, is a satirical take on the story full of changes to the storyline, characters' behavior, and even entire events.  Beowulf's behavior, in particular, is ridiculed by teachers as offensive - in the film he is the anti-hero.  So, while the mass of teachers are certainly not making unfounded criticisms, it is irresponsible and careless to consider the film devoid of educational value.  On the contrary, a well-structured viewing and discussion of the film after a thorough textual analysis of the original work will allow the students (especially lower-level students) an opportunity to re-engage with the original text with a fervor that was perhaps absent upon the initial reading.<br /> First, it is important to note that a supervised viewing of the film is required.  Certain scenes (especially Beowulf's \\"encounter\\" with Grendel's mother) should be edited.  Additionally, the instructor should discuss the film with the students as it moves along: How is this similar? How is this different?  Why would the filmmakers choose to film it this way?  With this type of guided viewing, the students are able to view the film version as a satirical retelling of the original - a \\"What if Beowulf is Not the Honest Hero We See in the Text?\\" version.  The fact remains that Beowulf has been passed down orally, with several changes over the centuries and any educated person is aware of this.  To consider these changes as form of blasphemy is outrageous; it goes against the very nature of generational storytelling.  In the case of Beowulf thefilm, its inauthenticity is what makes it authentic.<br /> Perhaps the greatest change the filmmakers implemented was the added depth to Grendel's character.  In the original text, he is not much more than a killing machine.  In the film, however, Grendel is a tortured soul seemingly in a constant state of suffering.  His attempts at communication, while unintelligible, provide a human quality that provides a new insight into the beast.  His desperate attempts to express himself provide students with a complex villain to discuss.<br /> Discussions following the film are not restricted to simple compare and contrast exercises.  Rather, the palette is rich with a vibrant analysis of the purpose of storytelling, the flaws of a protagonist, the process of adapting a text to film, even the audacity of making changes to such an important text.  Beowulf may be a terrible film when judging it simply as a film.  However, we should not show our students film versions of texts we read only because we think it is a \\"good\\" movie; there is no room for that type of self-indulgence in education.  The point of showing a film version is to open doors for discussing the original text, a discussion that will now be equipped with the perspective of modern-day filmmakers who have reimagined the story.<br /> In closing, it is unrealistic to expect a majority of educators to change their opinions about a film that has been repeatedly disgraced since its release.  Many teachers would scoff at the very mention of the film having value of any kind, especially any educational value.  It is unfortunate, then, that educators who pride themselves on embedding diversity and alternative perspectives into the classroom would renounce something simply because it is different.
B0040HO16S|4.0|Why didn't I hear of this great show before? I started watching this on my new Kindle Fire and have enjoyed season 1 so far. It's going to be very hard to pace myself for the other seasons. There's humor, drama, wisdom and a few tearjerker moments. It's a very good series.
B000JQUHLM|4.0|Really enjoyed being able to get this book and read thru it.  Pollyanna is worth reading and leaves one with a good 'feel good' mental attitude afterward!

B001PPLIEQ|4.0|Daniel Craig, Judi Dench, Jeffrey Wright and Jesper Christensen return.<br /> The long-awaited, Quantum of Solace (2008), is a direct sequel to [[ASIN:B000MRA5NS Casino Royale [Blu-ray]]] (2006) and continues immediately from where Casino Royale (2006) ended.<br /> We join James Bond (Daniel Craig) in the middle of a car chase, bullets and metal flying everywhere. With the car battered without a driver's door, he makes it to his destination to meet M (Judi Dench). He had Mr. White (Jesper Christensen) in the trunk of the car the whole time.<br /> M instructs Bond and then they attempt to get information out of Mr. White. They come to realize that their is a new enemy organization, Quantum, and Mr. White tells them, &#34;...they are everywhere&#34;.  Bond soon finds that out and is on another foot chase in Italy on the roof tops and in a bell tower. Along the way, he meets Camille (Olga Kurylenko) who offers him a ride.<br /> Bond goes on a trail to find his villain, Dominic Greene (Mathieu Almaric) and enlists the help of Rene Mathis (Giancarlo Giamnini) to go with him.  However, didn't we, the audience, after watching Casino Royale (2006), come to realize that Mathis could not be trusted?<br /><br /> Also in the cast: Gemma Arterton, Joaquin Cosio, Anatole Taubman, David Harbour, Rory Kinnear, Tim Pigott-Smith.<br /><br /> Cameo Appearance: EON Producer, Michael G. Wilson is the man sitting in a chair in the Haitian Hotel Lobby.<br /><br />  Right away you will notice this film has a different look. The traditional gun-barrel scene is gone, but turns up at the end of the movie. Also gone is the traditional phrase &#34;Bond...James Bond&#34; and &#34;Shaken, not stirred&#34;.<br /> Most of the scenes are filmed on location, but in dirty, grittier, run-down looking places. Nothing exotic here.<br />  The love scene between Bond and Agent Fields was cut very short.  When director Marc Forster really wanted this film to be cut to 106 minutes, he meant it by making it the shortest James Bond movie ever.<br />  I enjoyed the performances of Joaquin Cosio who I hope to see more of in the movies. I think he could have made a memorable villain if he were in the lead.<br /> Gemma Arterton as &#34;Agent Strawberry Fields&#34; certainly raised my eyebrow. Such an interesting character, but all too short-lived.<br /> Jeffrey Wright was given more to do in this movie as &#34;Felix Leiter&#34; and I hope we will see him in action again in later Bond movies.<br />  I enjoyed the dialogue they gave Giancarlo Giamnini as &#34;Rene&#34;. They made him a gentleman when he spoke with Bond. The taxi scenes were funny.<br /><br /> EON Producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli have mentioned they really want to change James Bond and with the upcoming movie (Bond 23 became SKYFALL), they want to make further changes. Nothing is familair in this James Bond movie as they take away traditions.  They are practically circumcising the James Bond character and look of the film. I do miss the tuxedoed, middle-aged James Bond with the interesting gadgets, his traditional phrases, flirting with Miss Moneypenny and quipping with Q.<br />  With every movie, the inside of Mi6 Headquarters and M's office looks different.<br />  I also miss the wonderful opening sequences they use to have with a brilliant song.  &#34;Another Way to Die&#34; sung by Jack White and Alicia Keys is the worst song I have ever heard in Bond movie history. It is rock and rap.<br />  I did like the composer David Arnold's music score within the film and &#34;Crawl, End Crawl&#34; by Four Tet, written by Arnold, played at the end credits, is a nice tune.<br /><br /> Quantum of Solace won't be remembered as the best. It only makes us yearn for the Bond movies of the past. [[ASIN:B006U1J5ZY Bond 50: The Complete 22 Film Collection [Blu-ray]]]<br />  However, this movie must be seen after watching Casino Royale (2006) to truly enjoy it.<br /><br /> Quantum of Solace has shades of [[ASIN:B00000K0E6 Goldfinger (Special Edition)]] (1964), [[ASIN:B00000K0E7 Licence To Kill (Special Edition)]] (1989) and a non-Bond film [[ASIN:B0019L21H4 The Godfather Part III - The Coppola Restoration]] (1990).<br /><br /> Next movies:<br /> [[ASIN:B007REV4YI Skyfall (Blu-ray/ DVD + Digital Copy)]] (2012).<br />SPECTRE (2015).:B00000K0E6 Goldfinger (Special Edition)]] (1964), [[ASIN:B00000K0E7 Licence To Kill (Special Edition)]] (1989) and a non-Bond film [[ASIN:B0019L21H4 The Godfather Part III - The Coppola Restoration]] (1990).<br /><br /> Next movies:<br /> [[ASIN:B007REV4YI Skyfall (Blu-ray/ DVD + Digital Copy)]] (2012).<br />SPECTRE (2015).
B00846REIS|5.0|I must say that this book is a good contender for the fifty shades series. I can not wait for the next book. I am also suprised that I like the genre so much.
0345803485|1.0|A HUGE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. One of the worst and immature books I have ever read. Please don't waste YOUR time. I can't understand the craze over this book.
B004MARLJ2|1.0|This is a review of the developer, not the game. Developers who go around and post fake 5-star reviews, and then call legitimate reviewers by names, deserve 0 stars. Due to technical limitations, here's one star.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|This book flowed well and kept my attention.  There were some good plot twists and they were realistic, not bogus and contrived.  If you are a fan of the genre of books written by Michael Connelly, you‘ll like this one.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a remarkable story.  It is well written, and very thought provoking.  This story is not only about the destruction of one cowardly terrorist, but of a daily struggle to rid the world of many of them.  These are difficult actions to put into words, but this has been done masterfully in this book.  I like what he says of retelling the correct account of this specific action, and his reasons for it.<br /><br />To the auther:<br />Well Done.  I hope you live a safe and peaceful life, for you very much have earned it.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|A Game of Shadows, in my opinion, does a fine job of living up to the first movie. Sure, there are some silly bits, but that's as it should be. This movie contains more action and less of the cerebral intrigue, but it's still good entertainment.
0525953728|5.0|A really great book if your interested in military actions.  The US Navy Seals are a hard, well trained breed.  I think you will enjoy this book as it leads you up to the taking of Osama Bin Laden and how the Seals trained for this mission.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Really enjoying the thinking part of this game. Stuck on a level but still trying to solve it without hints. Have no more coins to buy a hint. Just one over the winning one.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is pretty good. it is a challenge keeping up with your coin total. my kid likes it too.
B00992CF6W|1.0|it should be updated to 1.3.2 because there is so much better things in 1.3.2 and they should make the map bigger and add caves and everything so make it worth 7 dollars now im not saying dont buy it im saying buy it its a good game but they really need a update i believe it is at like 1.8 and it shoudnt i in my opion i love 1.3.2 thanks for listening and if mojang and or the whole kindle whatever i reading this plzzz update this edition and xbox and computer they all need to be updated thanks for your time
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|What can you say, on Android it's getting better all the time.  Still not as good as on a PC, but you get all this power in the palm of you hand and get to take it with you.  Nice upgrade.
B009329Y30|5.0|I thought maybe this wdnt be that good-thought of the main actor as a younger Disney actor-but he is all grown up in this movie ladies. It is a very romantic movie and any woman would love to be rescued from him in her situation.
B008Y1RTUG|4.0|This movie was pretty good.  It had great affects that kept you interested.  I would definitely recommend the movie and don't want to say much about it due to ruining it for someone reading this.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved this book, not only because of the story line but of the significance of the 'personality' of the flowers.  We read about the present life of an orphaned young woman, peeking into her past and present life experiences and the gifts/skills she gains that leads her into her own existence.
1907590099|5.0|Astute observations and ruthlessly logic conclusions by a very sharp mind. Also source of some classic quotes that will amaze you with how dead on they are and how they capture a big truth in a few words. This guy is one of the smartest men ever. Read it and be awed.
0525953728|5.0|Absolutely could not set this book down after I cracked it open. Thank you for sharing this story in such vivid detail. The voice or narration is just superb! I recommend it to ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE!! Help support fallen SEAL charities with your purchase!
B004L3AR0K|4.0|There are plenty of reviews on the specific plot points & acting so I'll just say it worked for me on pretty much every level.<br /><br />I especially liked that I felt like it did a very good job at pointing out that money does not equate to happiness whether somewhat by accident or on purpose.<br /><br />I almost don't know why I took 1 star off other than it's not generally my type of movie and I don't know how much replay value it has.  I generally only give 5 stars to movies I want to see again & again which mostly means Sci-Fi/Comic action type of stuff.  That's my main area of interest but this was a happy detour from that.
B009329Y30|3.0|I usually love movies made from Nicholas Spark's novels but this one was only average to me.  The storyline was very interesting but I never could quite buy into the chemistry between characters.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I had this game on my mytouch phn and was addicted to it!!! I'm so enthralled whn thy. finally got it on the kindle fire!! I'm waiting for the cookie and holiday one now!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|easy to play, difficult to master. game is fun and addicting. only knock,  is the amount of coins allotted. coins should be unlimited.
B001608QVS|5.0|The ultimate collectors edition is great! It comes with 5 Blu-rays, and some pretty cool extras. I especially like the copies of telegrams and letters from the studio in the 70s while Dirty Harry was in pre-production. My husband loved this great gift and I can't wait for us to have our Dirty Harry marathon. :)
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|The book is great. It gives a stunning look into a terrible world that we normally never hear or think about. Several times I had to take a break from reading, so as not to be overwhelmed with a sense of dread. I could easily follow the development of Shin through the narrative. The one thing that I really lack is a proper end. It feels like the book has been written to soon, as in, I do not feel that Shin has reached much of any kind of goal when the story ends. A few more years of his experiences in the western world would have been nice.<br /><br />To sum up, a great book, but I lacked Catharsis in the end.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I really enjoyed Cheryl's emotional/spiritual adventure.  My faith has been restored that \\"most\\" people are wonderful people.  In my own camping adventures, I have a new respect for hikers. I probably will invite them to dinner.  The book was very hard to put down.  She writes very well.
B0081L37Z0|4.0|Pretty funny....worth renting.  But glad I didn't pay to see in theater.  Would've been awesome if they would've put old cast from tv show in there more.
B0040Z9H5K|4.0|I don't think in general that sequels are as good as the original. That being said this was pretty good. We enjoyed it. I think if you'd never seen the first Iron Man you'd still be able to watch this and enjoy it, which is a god thing. I like this series of moves very much.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Great movie, and good price for a quick rental! However sometimes the video quality can be pretty poor, it will go from good to bad with the change of a scene. I also don't like how you cant fast forward, rewind, choose your scene, etc, Its like watching the movie on YouTube.
B0046ECFRM|2.0|I read this book about a month ago, and have read 6 books in between, so the details are a little sketchy but the bad vibe it left is still fresh in my mind.<br /><br />The book is about a teenage girl being shipped off to school in a foreign country, and her struggle to fit in a make friends. The characters are well developed and the story did hold by interest. The problem I had with the story line was that it centered around Anna's relationship with a boy who is stringing her along throughout the entire book. The relationship starts out friendly, but becomes romantic. As the relationship becomes romantic, he is in fact cheating on his long time girl friend. This is justified by him going through a rough spell and not wanting to be alone. He keeps Anna on the back burner, until he knows she is a sure thing, before he leaves his girlfriend. God forbid he should go through a dry spell with out the support and other benefits of having a girlfriend. Is that really OK?!?<br /><br />I guess two weak people getting together just isn't my thing.
B0092MKTL2|5.0|I was pretty impressed by this album and that's really saying something. It was recommended to me by a friend who is a huge fan of Imagine Dragons, so I thought that I'd give it a shot. All I have to say is that I was blown away. There's maybe one or two songs that I don't prefer to listen to, not necessarily because they are bad, but because their other songs are so amazing. This is an incredible album and I'm still recommending it to all of my friends!
B004XUMMJU|5.0|This is my favorite episode. It differs stylistically from the rest of the series, in that it tells its story alternately in three time frames: events in the present, events in the near-past that led to the present, and events in the past that led to the formation of Serenity's crew.<br /><br />I love the character development, storytelling, and overall cleverness of the whole series. This series is pure brilliance.<br /><br />Fun fact about this episode: according to the DVD commentary, Alan Tudyk took the big red \\"recall\\" button from the Firefly set and presented it to Joss Whedon, telling him that if Whedon managed to get the series renewed, he could press it to call the cast back.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is fun. I like it. It makes me happy. I play it a lot. I would recommend you play this game too.

B0094KF4WG|5.0|Well written, balanced and unopinionated - as much as can be considering being told by the 1st person.<br />Really brings home what these guys deal with at 'work', when the worst thing most of us (myself included) have to deal with are office politics; rather than bullets and bombs.<br /><br />Details have apparently been omitted to ensure there are no security conflicts, however there was enough detail to get a good understanding of the training and planning that went into the mission and what actually happened that night.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|i am not a reader at all so when i started reading the fisrt on i thought i would not get into them but i did. and they are the best books i have read.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I'm not going to tell you what this book is about. I'm sure many other people have done this.<br /><br />I really liked this book (and series). It really reminds me of Jim Butcher's Dresden books. I read this book nearly straight through. It was a fun read.
B0091TGWYE|5.0|I got it today and couldn't be happier. I'm used to having a different kind of case for my previous iPhone, but this one is growing on me quickly. The quality is beautiful, a lot better than expected. The elastic pull is awesome, I wasn't sure about that part, but it works like a charm. It is definitely snug! One thing about the tan suede... I probably should have gotten a darker one since I tend to have random spills/accidents with things that stain (lipstick on my white pants, etc.), but I'll just have to make sure I'm extra careful not to set it down on something dirty.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Amazing convoluted story line with intriging characters and twists and turns with the ability to surprise.  Extremely enjoyable and complex.  The characters feel real and it is easy to get involved in their lives.  I can hardly wait to turn each page.
031603441X|3.0|Pretty strange book, but overall somewhat entertaining. Keith Richards appeared to have a pretty keen sense of humour and some of his comments in the book were very witty. He had a bunch of good stories about the Stones and about those who travelled in their same galaxy.<br /><br />If the reader was expecting a memoir or autobiography in the same vein as Winston Churchill or Dwight Eisenhower, this was not the book for them. The book meandered around directionless at times with butchered grammar and poor sentence structure. Although the autobiography was entitled \\"Life\\", the reader should not expect any words of wisdom about life, Keith Richards appears to be about as deep as a rain drop on the sidewalk. Yes, he can talk about open tuning and how to shoot up smack, but as far as sharing any deep philosophy or wisdom about life or even effective parenting, it wasn't there.<br /><br />Just when I was ready to give up on the book, Richards would pull out of his literary tail spin and come up with an interesting tale about his life with the Stones. The book was way too long and a good editor would have whacked at least thirty per cent of this rambling mess without breaking a sweat. The book really could have used an editor but I would guess that the publisher kept in the rambling and meandering style since it probably captures Richards' rambling and meandering personality.<br /><br />Some portions of the book were a bit incoherent, confusing, and boring, but I had to assume Richards's mind was a little bit muddled and damaged by the time he wrote this book and that not every day of his life as a Stone was walking the tightrope of life.<br /><br />I thought it was amusing that Keith Richards viewed himself as such a tough guy. He just does not look that role with his pencil-thin neck and his spaghetti-sized guns (arms). He looks anything but menacing, but to hear him tell it he is one bad dude. I guess hiding behind bodyguards, knives and pistols made up for his lack of physical toughness. Quite frankly, Richards's tough guy schtick got pretty old by the end of the book when he wrote he was going to slit this guy's throat or slit that guy's throat. I think he took his acting job in Pirates of the Carribean too seriously.<br /><br />Keith Richards was truly an interesting, but world class narcissistic character (obvious understatement) and his life was filled with more excitement and drama than anyone should be allowed. It would be unfair to judge Richards's life - the music, the drug abuse, and the poor parenting and role model, but it would also not be right to idolize him. Just like the rest of us, he is flawed.<br /><br />After reading the book, I did not feel that I learned anything worthwhile. It was not a book where a person learned valuable life lessons from a wise and great man. Keith Richards will never be mistaken for a genius of business or philosophy. I learned tidbits of information about the Rolling Stones, much like reading an extra long People magazine interview. This was a fun book and definitely worth reading for those patient enough to read through the endless pages of Richards's preening, bragging, dribbling, injecting, meandering, and drooling.physical toughness.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|...\\"His expression was unreadable\\"... \\"Oh My!\\"  Perhaps because I listened to this rather than read it contributed to the annoyance of hearing expressions over and over. And I don't believe that Anna could really be as naive as she's portrayed. Way over-rated.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Enjoyed this game with PC version and loved it!  So glad it is now available for my Kindle Fire.  Works great on this tablet too.  No glitches.  Very smooth!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I enjoy this game very much. I like the ease of playing. lots and lots bonuses. I find the game to be very addictive and much cheaper than dropping quarters into the machine at the arcade. I look forwards to many more hours of play and bonuses.  the only drawback to these games is that you require twenty words on a review
B008PZ69T8|5.0|Every single one of these Aria's are beyond beautiful listening.  Take me away....  As other reviewers have already stated, combining this CD with reading the delectably yummy Fifty Shades trilogy is heavenly complete.  Now bring on the Jazz Album and the Rock Pop Albums.  I'm anticipating more along this line.  Masterfully well done!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After friends and family talked of this book and urged me to read it, I finally gave in and did. Quarter of the way into the book, I should have stuck with my initial plan not to spend money on it but it was already spent.<br />The story, if that's what one calls it, lacks depth, emotion, character, meaning and a story line. What it doesn't lack is the occasional attention to detail; often sickening, warped detail. It's considered erotic fiction, though personally I didn't find it erotic nor romantic in the least; I found it disturbing and disgusting.<br />I wish I didn't waste my money on this book and I'm thankful that I didn't buy the trilogy initially as I doubt it will change my mind about this 'story'.<br />Lesson learned: go with the gut.
B006QF61VA|5.0|Great movie based on a true story, starring one of the most versatile talents in Hollywood.  Rented the movie to play on my Kindle while flying home from Seattle - kept my mind off the plane ride and made it enjoyable - laughed and cried the whole way home.
B00338QENI|5.0|Author does terrific job of interweaving personal story of Henrietta and her family, and the toll taken on them by all the publicity, and the story of Henrietta's amazing immortal cells that have made possible development of multiple vaccines and breakthroughs in treating cancers, etc.  I read the book with tears in my eyes and gained a new awareness of the need to safeguard personal medical information.<br /><br />A very good read.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|WOW ... If anyone want to read an interesting description of medieval british history ( a fiction of it ), then READ this novel!!! And I am waiting for the second and not only novel. Wonderful writing
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|oh my goodness!!  can't believe how much fun this is!!  I don't want to put it down!!  this is a blast!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Please don't let the bad reviews scare you away from reading this series. This is a work of fiction to  be enjoyed as such.  It's a sweet love story with many an interested twist.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
1416955070|4.0|At first the book wasreally good but still a little slow. Sometimes I Would have to reread the pageor secction five times before Ieven understood it. But once I got more into the book it started to just real me in,I couldn't stop reading! I enjoy this book. I would definately recommendit!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|this is a great app but I think the makers kinda lucked out. I don't think they will get so lucky next time
B006LSZECO|1.0|I didn't like this novel at all.  The main characters were hateful, angry, manipulative people that it made it difficult for me to sympathize with either of them.  I didn't care what happened to the them.  Also, there was no surprise nor suspense in the story for me.  I knew from the beginning what would happen.  Why is this book in the  best selling list?  I have no clue.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I have always loved the Friends TV series and this complete collection is simply perfect. Every hilarious episode packed into one box that's nice enough to be on display on my TV stand for everyone to see!
0439023521|4.0|I am a little bit conflicted with this book. I enjoyed the plot and the character of Katniss. In fact there are a lot of things to like about the novel. But I really had a problem with the world building. The story takes place in a post apocalyptic North America. There is very little back story provided. A long time ago there was a calamity, out of which came the country called Panem. It is ruled from a Capitol city surrounded by 13 districts. 75 years ago or so the districts rebelled against the Capitol and were defeated. One district was obliterated and the remaining 12 are forced every year to supply two teens, one male and one female to compete in the Hunger Games, a televised contest where the teens will fight to the death until only one remains. The purpose is stated to be partly revenge for the rebellion and an attempt to intimidate the districts, because of a fear that another rebellion could take place.<br />The teens from the Districts are chosen by lottery. For the purposes of the novel it is obviously more dramatic if the odds of getting picked are higher- so we are told the total population of District 12, the home district of our protagonist, is 8,000 people. If we assume that the other district's populations are of the same magnitude, then the total population of all the districts is about 100k to 150k. That's not a lot of people, especially since it is implied that the districts cover the former area of the US, the Capitol being specifically placed in the novel in the Rocky Mountains and District 12 in Appalachia. Furthermore the Capitol is implied to be a large city, and has a very high technology. A technology that has cloaked hovercraft and the ability to genetically modify animals. In contrast the Districts technology is that of horse drawn carts and bow and arrows (although they have TV).<br />It makes no sense that the Districts would be militarily any challenge to the Capitol- they are too few people at too great a distance away, with too primitive technology. And it makes no sense for a Capitol so technologically advanced to rely on (very few) half starved laborers to provide them raw materials and food. The whole premise behind the idea of the Hunger Games just didn't ring true to me.<br />Having said all that I did like the book, and after the first few chapters I got engrossed in the drama of the games themselves, forgetting about the world outside the arena.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl was an extremely fun read that was hard to put down. It had so many twists and the way the author put together the novel it always left you wanting more after each chapter. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone.
B008602KQI|5.0|I was somewhat disappointed with Katniss's character but the books were phenominal.  I think they were very well written and exciting and made you not want to stop reading until the end.  I wish Katniss had a stronger character but she did end up like a lot of our Vets after being in a life or death conflict.  Still her not being able to make up her mind about life was somewhat disappointing since the entire country was depending on her.  Other than that, I thought it was well worth the cost of the books and I bought the DVD as well.
B005LAII80|3.0|And if this is what the future is going to be like then I want no part of it, the violence in some sections was just totally unneeded but what can you expect from a violence prone action piece, it needed to be more engaging even though I thought the scene where they opened up with the motoized machine guns was awesome to an extent where they tore apart the inside of the locked down tower when they went after Dredd and his cohort, the drug kingpin being a female was a switch of pace but overall I'd give it a lackluster performance review.<br />Still can't beleive a paid $6 bucks for the matinee showing.<br />I believe that I'll wait for the DVD to come out and then rent it from the library to see the extras but I don't think that I'll be buying it. It wasn't all that good.<br />I think that the version played by Sly Stallone was played better.<br />Showing where the cops are actually worse then the criminals that they go after is a bit overbearing concept too. \\"80 percent of all cops are criminals and violate the laws/s while on duty\\".
0679746048|3.0|I was very interested in the book and film after finding out it was written by a women diagnosed with BPD, which I have.  However, it doesn't talk much about her mental condition, it's more about the mental hospital and the other girls that are there.  It almost reads like a book of anecdotes, with pieces of her medical records interspersed.  It skips around quite a bit in time.  I saw the movie first, and was not very impressed with it.  I sat down and read the book all in one sitting, and found it an easy read and very engrossing, although definitely not the best book if you are wanting to learn about BPD.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|So inspiring.  I read the last part of this book outloud and alone. It was difficult to make my way through it because I was crying.  This is another one of his books with a great message.
B0091THDOM|5.0|I've had several sleeve-type cases for my iPhones over the years, and this is one of the nicest I've used.  It is a very snug fit, which I prefer, preventing phones from accidentally slipping out.  After a couple of days of use, the sleeve has begun to break in nicely while still remaining snug.  The elastic strap mechanism works well, retracting after you pull it, and the pull tab magnetically attaches to the sleeve -- these features address the most annoying thing about other pull-to-remove straps in other sleeves I've used (dangling straps).  All in all, a well-executed sleeve based on a minimalist and classy design.  Highly recommended.
B006MPKD54|2.0|[[ASIN:1455519650 The Black Ice (Harry Bosch)]]<br /><br />Having read all the Harry Bosch books I was disappointed in this offering. Like many authors, Michael Connelly has gone to the well one too many times.  All the other books in this series have left me wanting more - not this time!
B0086700CM|2.0|Due to the overwhelming amount of 5-star reviews, I was really looking forward to trying Temple Run.  I don't have any of the glitches other people are complaining about (the sensitivity is adjustable, tilt-screen works, etc) but I can't get to any level changes.  I don't know if there's a paid version that you have to buy to get the \\"power ups\\" and other levels, but I just run, and jump, and run, and jump...no new scenery, no new challenges....It really is an addictive game, but for lack of different challenges, I will not be recommending this app.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I greatly enjoy this ap, I am a licensed cosmetologist and I love to look on here for different visual insperations. Also a great way to share projects with people, or to escape life visually for a moment.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The sexual content was a bit heavy.  By the third book I was scanning thru that (about 3 pages worth.  Story was good, would of liked more of that. Was glad I read it-my three daughters all read it & think it's funny that I did.  I do enjoybeing able to understand all the hype on TV about it!
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This book series is addictive, I've read 5 of the books so far. The author's writing makes you feel you are there.
B000IZA9PI|3.0|I didn't see this movie when it was first released because each subsequent season of TNG after 5 got worse and worse, then the TNG movies got worse, so I expected this to follow the trend.  Happily it did not, and was better than Insurrection.<br /><br />Even having improved upon the previous movie, it wasn't good enough to keep the TNG machine going.  No fault of the actors, the writers and producers had a weak idea right from the beginning, but at least in this case, unlike Insurrection, it was well executed.
B008BIN9EW|3.0|This game is simple to play. Not very challenging. I play a mission just before bed to past some time.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I can full appreciate this man's decision to go against the norm and tell things about his life and about this mission.  To those that are upset at the fact that he signed nondisclosure papers, what about our President and the other \\"official\\" people who should also learn to keep their mouths shut, not promote themselves.  I found his account of the seal training and life committment very interesting and the mission was facinating.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Love yahoo mail! i'm always checking my e-mail and this app makes it so easy! i especially like that i can check multiple items to delete all at once.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|This story is different.  You expect it to be very sad yet it is not.  At times yes, but a different perspective about death.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I was very hesitant to purchased this Kindle addition of Lee Child's latest Jack Reacher story based on the mixed reviews.  What a mistake that would of been if I hadn't .  I finished this in a weekend just like every book he has written.  I think some people did not get 1. This is fiction 2. So what if a majority, but not all, took place in a car and finally 3. This was a damn good story!  I was disappointed  about how the reviews I have counted on in the past were completely unreliable when it came to this book.<br />My only complaint is the price of Kindle editions are slowly rising to a point where I will stop buying books from Amazon if they continue to try and get more and more money for electronic editions.  There is no justification for charging more for an electronic edition.  If anything, the price should come down, not up.
B0087HT36U|5.0|lots of challenging levels that you can play for hours and hours. not boring. now that I finished I need more levels.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|Memorable.  I recommend to anyone interested in the phenomena of healing energy, and the effect of emotions on the body. Highly enjoyed and recommended.
B005WGBQ9G|2.0|Doesn't go anywhere. One boring side-track after another. The characters are not that interesting. They sit in one situation per episode. No progress. Plenty of military weapons laying around, M2 .50 caliber machine guns, tanks ( why not start one up and use it? )etc... and they do not gather them. They keep themselves meagerly armed despite many opportunities to upscale their protection. Someone needs to pick up one of those M2 machine guns a mow down a heard of walkers. Then it would be more interesting. Budget issues? Poorly done.
B001IYCMNA|5.0|I am a seasoned IT vet of 18 years.  The unit was purchased for a small business WiFi over a domain.<br />This WAP installed easy.  Administration was intuitive.  Has good range w/ included antennas.<br />Has several options for security to lock down access.  Has proven itself to be reliable.<br />No complaints...its Cisco, it does its job.
B00881VLCE|2.0|not alot to choose from for free. Downloaded hoping to get some for kids and nothing really good for them.
B0007PAMR4|4.0|The first time around,did not get the sence of the picture thhis time I better understood the plot. This made it more enjoyable.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book was fantastic.  A very interesting look at not only the Bin Laden event, but inside the world of Seals.  I only wish this book was longer.  I wanted more.  I look forward to any future books by this author.
B008MM9630|5.0|its so fun and creative and entertaining. its a very neat idea to have a magical little farm like this
B008OOYALE|1.0|countued to crash. write developers a mounth ago. they wrote back with basic of info needed. Then nothing. wrote a few more times, no updates, no emails, no help at all.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Awesome story of the sacrifice these guys make for their country. Nice to see some actual facts instead of speculation.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app just works. It was exactly what I needed after my Android phone was stolen. I'd been using Colornote and was quite content. I was happy that I could sync it across both my phone and my Kindle Fire. Well, the impossible happened. After my phone was stolen, I could access my many, many, many notes on my KF, so that was great. Then, my precious little 3 yr old reset my KF (well, now it's hers). Or I did. For some reason it had been acting very funny that day, and so even when I was trying to help her, it incorrectly offered me the option to reset it, as if I had pressed that button. So one of us did and I couldn't believe it. I had since replaced my Android phone with an iPhone, which does not offer the Colornote app. I was frantic. When I was able to add my account to the KF again, I downloaded the app and thankfully, it worked. But that made me realize I needed an app offered for both operating systems. Which led me to the Evernote I'd read so much about. It's available on both Android and iOS AND online. Should every device be lost, stolen or just plain inoperable for some reason, my notes, dreams, plans, ideas, projects, are all available... And I LOVE the fact that it could import note FROM Colornote on my KF!! So, PERFECT! I'm about to get the paid version, because I will soon have password & acct info stored.
B000LJ9ZWE|3.0|I bought this for my husband's Kindle Fire. He likes the movie a lot. I do not, so I'm probably the wrong one to review this.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|You will enjoy the firsthand account of this mission that killed Osama Bin Laden for many reasons. This seal takes you through making the Navy Seal teams, progressing to Seal Team 6, then to being selected to the mission of capture or kill Bin Laden. As you read No Easy Day you feel you are right next to \\"Mark Owen\\" as he prepares for this mission that special operates were dreaming of being part of the mission to capture or kill UBL. A must if you enjoy reading about military operations.
B007JRU2UK|5.0|This is a story about a family in crises and the steps they must take to move forward to a new understanding of each other and their place in the world.  Excellently portrayed by George Clooney, the father must face the fact that he has mostly been an absentee father living in denial of what is really going on with his family.  It is a wonderful study of the human soul.
0345803485|3.0|I knew a little about this book before I read it.  I had to see what all the hype was about.  I found the basic storyline and relationship complications very interesting, but created more questions than answers...perhaps the answers come in the next 2 books, which I intend to read.  The writing was a little juvenile for such a mature topic, and VERY repetative.  Even the sex scenes got repetative because they all started and ended the same way.  But, as I said, the core of the story is intriguing...how a person with severe emotional issues tries to be \\"normal\\" for a girl he cares deeply about but cannot love...how a naive girl with no experience tries to come to terms with a demanding relationship...it raises the question of how far will one go to save a relationship?  I just wish it had been written in a more mature fashion.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I really like how you can use this app and combine sounds while simultaneously controlling the volume of each individual sound...helps you to wind down your way!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|a great game when you need something to pass a little time. doesn't take any effort. a game my daughter can play also.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|For the first approximate half of the book, I did not like the main male character so it was hard to keep going.  However, my compassion for him grew as I learned of his background, and by the end of the story I rejoiced for his future.  I'm glad to have read it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|tap the app once don't work I had to force close then it works please fix app is addicting!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&iexcl;&iexcl;!!!! needs to be updated or something!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite films.  There are a lot of people out there who would agree.  These are people of both genders and all ages.  The DVD is very clear and the extra bonus material just makes the experience of the whole thing richer.  I love it and highly reccomend.  It is also a great value.
B008XG1X18|5.0|&lt;3 I love pinterest! It's fun, easy, &amp; very informative! I think I would be lost without it! I've made many recipes and done lists of crafts!
B004EWFV9K|5.0|More than a simple page turner, which it is. It goes inside Wallander'd mind, and is thus multiple dimensional.<br />As all Henningg's books they are so much more than the TV adaptions. Reading the book first diminishes the TV shows, which clearly can't capture in 1 1/2 hours the color and depth of his writing, which are true novels, full of depth with insights into the  of Wallender'sa psyche.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Battery HD give me information visually that in other way I have to analyze to get it. For example, at a glance I can see /how much charge I have. Not only reading but is I use music or in other tasks. I recommend it.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I had a problem that was not immediately evident.  Disks 1 & 2 of the Season 3 set were defective and would not play.  (Disk 3 was fine.)  Amazon made good by providing a refund for that set.  I then re-ordered the Season 3 set alone from Amazon and it was in good condition.  Nicely done Amazon!
B005IQZB14|3.0|I really, really wanted to like this book. I wanted truth about the human condition or some sort of coming to terms with a crappy childhood. Neither occurred.<br /><br />In fact, Ms. Strayed seems to lay sole claim to a crappy childhood, to which I say unkind words. Many, many, many of us had exactly the same childhood. Many, many, many of us had a youth littered with death, alcoholism, screaming, poverty, and any number of other really super unpleasant experiences. We managed to resolve them without resorting to promiscuity, drug addiction, and a wealth of self-pity. All these many years later, we just say - hmmm, BTDT.<br /><br />Her trail experience was littered with a litany of further sufferings, none of which drew much sympathy from me. Poor poor pitiful me lapses into I am Woman, without a logical bridge between.<br /><br />Honestly, it's a decent read. I  blew through it in two days, which really means there was not much meat to this story.<br /><br />If you are looking for a real memoir of loss, read The Year of Magic Living. If you are  looking for a mildly entertaining Girls Night Out story of my time on the PCT, read Wild.
B007N5YJYS|5.0|Absolutely the finest quality DVD of the Hitchcock version of THE 39 STEPS I have ever seen.  Definitely worth the money, especially if you've been subjected to the poor quality copies previously available.  Picture and sound quality have been perfectly restored.  It was a genuine pleasure to watch, especially on a LARGE screen HD TV. Buy it, you'll like it.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|There isn't much of a story line and the sex scenes are very repetitive. Just how many times can biting your bottom lip, 'really' turn someone on!
B0086700CM|5.0|With simple controls and a wonderful reward system, this game is ingenious. With coins you collect you are able to purchase characters, power ups, and wall papers. Extremely enjoyable, anyone can play
B007IXWL2C|3.0|However, the sex scenes are still very repetitive and predictable. She's still biting her bottom lip...and he's STILL getting turned on by it! Go figure!!
B008H5J510|5.0|Katy and company do a great job with this documentary, interweaving personal and concert footage.  She has an amazing story to tell, and she seems to be a consummate professional.<br /><br />The video is top notch and so is the audio.  Crank it UP!<br /><br />What makes this movie especially enjoyable is that I saw KP on this tour in Columbia, MD with my wife and daughter.<br /><br />Katy has a strong support network of family and friends, and she will find the right man when the time comes. There is plenty of time for a family in 10+ years from now.<br /><br />However, Katy, I do think you are mature enough to handle being a mother. Putting this off until you have the time to be a mother is very wise. ROCK ON.<br /><br />Good Luck Katy (K Hudson)

B008K3HRF0|4.0|I bought the 3D movie from Best Buy.  A digital download, included with purchase, allowed me to get for free a download directly to my computer, or Amazon On Demand.<br /><br />Unfortunately the credit given to purchase from Amazon was only for the SD version.  I wish they would have given me an HD version for my TV.  No comparison to my blu-ray version, although it is still watchable. On a mobile or handheld player this would have been adequate, but sometimes I don't have access to my blu-ray copy, so an HD version in the cloud would have been nice.<br /><br />Amazon, if you are reading this, could you set me up with the HD version for my Amazon library?
034580404X|5.0|Reading this novel, it definitely is in a class of its own ... it reminds me of Dick Wolf's brillance in Law and Order: SVU.  The character of Christian Grey truly exemplifies the importance of nuturing a child, as their adult life is merely the extension of that life lived.  Anastaia Steele's intelligence of a woman showcases the depth of your inner self, the exploration of feelings untapped and truly learning to just be who you are.  I love this trilogy ... in between the lines, you end up feeling that LOVE conquers all!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Very addicting but extremely informative!!!  I love this app! There is solo much information that you can get lost for hours.
B007TMON8M|4.0|Simple, easy to use, and can be very challenging.  My 12 yr old son loves it as much as I do.
B00304RMFE|3.0|You'd expect a collection of animated shorts about the Halo universe to be much better than the usual drivel thrown out there by other companies.<br /><br />The Halo universe has been fleshed out over 11 years in video games, books, graphic novels, and Way Point. This adds almost nothing to the mythos.<br /><br />If you are a die- hard Halo fan then this is for you. Anyone not familiar with the series will surely be left with one impression \\"meh\\".<br /><br />I for one hate the 'anime' style, it looks sloppy, and since the original dialogue is recorded and lip synced in Japanese it reminds me of the old Godzilla movies.<br /><br />To me the only segments worth while were Origins 1 & 2. Which is a sort of the 'story so far' wrap-up.<br /><br />If you are a Halo fan-buy it.  If not , run away, it probably isn't for you.
160774273X|5.0|As previous reviewers have mentioned, this book improves upon the foundation laid by authors like Jim Lahey and Peter Reinhart. In fact, if you like the no-knead technique but haven't necessarily been impressed with the results, you MUST buy this.

B008AWBQGW|5.0|The album is one of the best to be released since the \\" God & Guns\\" album. I love their music and their sound is unique.  They are southern rock through and through, but the songs are stories of true events that touch all our lives. I think it is the best album to come along in a long time.  Skynyrd is a band that harkens to their roots and they never let you forget their  humble beginings. They are family and that is unquie in itself.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Each season keeps getting better. Jimmy Smits was great! I love the way the season concludes. Dexter always surprizes and delights!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The story is engrossing, never a dull moment, and I feel the hype about all the dark BDSM content is a little undeserved.  Sure there are a lot of sex scenes, and I learned a lot about the BDSM lifestyle, but the main characters don't engage in anything really shocking.  Still this book is not for the faint of heart.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love coin dozed because its fun and interestindg. any age child can play coin dozed except baby's and any other child under the age of about five but any way i persanaly love this game sooooooo mush!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|After all the BDSM hype, I expected to be shocked.  But this is a really good romance with a twist.  What romance reader doesn't like a beautiful heroine who doesn't know she is beautiful and a handsome, filthy rich hero with a dark side?  My feeling throughout the book was, \\"Can't wait to see what happens next.\\"
B004A7UVLC|5.0|This show is absolutely entertaining.  Like many of the British television shows that have made it big here in the States, \\"Sherlock\\" provides solid performances from actors who have inhabited deliciously complex characters in a world where things are rarely black and white.  Cumberbatch is oddly pale and vampire-like, but is strangely attractive as the witty, extremely observant lead character that has sociopath tendencies.  Freeman delivers as the quirky sidekick who actually has a persona independent of the lead.  I have to admit that I have never read any of the \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" literature, but this television series is a great contender among the myriad of crime dramas that seem to rehash the same ole same ole.  Yet this one stands out.  The writing, acting, and directing is superb, and I look forward to continuing with these \\"mini movies.\\"

B000JBWWQ0|5.0|I was very satisfied with this movie. I ordered a used copy and it was basically brand new and in great condition. It was also a great film for anyone who is into spiritual movies. Great cast and story line. I would definately order from this place again. The shipping was really quick as well. Thanks!
B0090EKRKU|5.0|My two six year old sons loved this movie and watched it two more times before our rental was expired.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed the suspense and details of the mystery.  I imagined several possible solutions.  In the end, I found the ending of this book so disappointing that I felt cheated out of the time I spent reading it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Both my husband and I like this Bible.  It is so easy to find the book, chapter and verse. Plus you can look up the same scripture in another version so easily.  The only problem that we have found, is that you have to be connected to the \\"wifi\\". We had hoped that you could read it at any time, even if you don't have wireless access.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading \\"No Easy Day\\".  I was curious based on the media coverage and the fact that our government was so upset about it being published.  I have read many non-fiction war stories and found this one to be no different.  From my point of view, it didn't divulge anything too sensitive or anything that would give the enemy a leg up.  It was a well told story and provided me with some closure about the capture and killing of Bin Laden.  I don't think the government wanted to vet it for classified info they wanted to vet it because he doesn't always stand on the governments side.  Either way, well written and enjoyable.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Of all of the movies I have watched after reading the books, this was the closest yet. The tweaks were neccesary that were made so no hard feelings. makeup amd setting was phenomenol. well done
0553382152|1.0|I have read a few books regarding NDE's and have found them fascinating; however, this book is not. Betty Eadie gave me the impression that she either feels the strong need to save us all or she wants to make money.  The book is boring at best.  I was interested in the beginning but after a couple of chapters one feels as though they are being preached to about the Savior and Jesus, etc. It was enough to make me want to throw the book in the trash but I was curious about how it ended. Now, that I have finished reading it, it is going in the trash.  Why would the devil be angry with her for leaving Jesus and the Savior and coming back to earth?  She states in her book that this was the case.  As I said above, I've read a lot of NDE accounts and find them to be extremely interesting and thought provoking but this book was not. As another reviewer referred to it as trash, I would agree. I feel like she is insulting everybody's intelligence by writing this book and expecting people to believe it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love this book!!! It gives an interesting view on life in high school apart from typical head cheerleader/football star. Love it!
159562015X|3.0|The value of StrengthsFinder 2.0 is not the book itself, it's the survey that you take. It comes with an access code (WARNING: Don't buy this book used or your book will be worthless) that enables you to take the Gallup StrengthsFinder survey. You get about 20 seconds for each question - go with your first answer. At the end you get a report that will detail your top 5 strength areas. This is better than typical personality tests (e.g. DISC) in that it focuses more on what you do well as opposed to trying to label you as \\"dominant\\" or \\"steady.\\" With all that being said...the book itself is pretty worthless. The first 25 pages provides a summary of the theory that we waste our time trying to fix our weaknesses when we get more \\"bang for the buck\\" by working on our strengths. The majority of pages simply reprint the report summaries (though insight on how to work with others' strengths is useful). Worth the price in order to take the survey, but the book itself isn't that valuable.
B008XCF7Y6|5.0|If this movie was real life actors I would of gave it a 10 of 10 but I will rate it a 7<br />Greate graphics and action needed better weapons.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|There is no bad acting here; good music; fantastic production design and costuming; excellent locations.  This is a story of various kingdoms battling each other for power and control over the whole dominion.  Mainly it's the Lannisters vs. the Starks, but there are also people coming from much farther away, and there are Wildlings that commit savagery in the forest, and much more.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Thought this was going to be lame but to my surprise I couldn't put it down. Download and play a few rounds. You wont be disappointed.
B004B8K2C8|5.0|I'm not one who generally watches much TV outside of sports, but I gave the first episode a chance and was immediately sucked in.  The acting is great, fantastic story lines, beginning to end this series is exceptionally well done.  Each show is produced in what I would call a movie-like fashion.  I love the dark and gritty feel, they have done a wonderful job of bringing both Holmes and Watson to life on the screen.  Even without a background on Sherlock Holmes I think a person would find the stories gripping.  After each episode I can't wait for the time to view the next one.  I only wish there were more!  I've viewed them on both Netflix and Amazon Prime and the Netflix versions are higher quality, though they seem to lock up from time to time which is why I've viewed some on Prime as well.
0316023744|5.0|Antony Beevor slanders and slurs Britain's allies throughout this otherwise exciting history. In those chapters on the German invasion of France in May 1940 the French are again and again portrayed as incompetent and deceitful cowards, whereas the British Expeditionary Force fighting alongside the French is always brave and resourceful. A very small British counterattack at Arras is described like this; \\"Rommel himself witnessed his infantry and gunners run for their lives, and the newly arrived SS Totenkopf mechanized infantry division was panic stricken...\\"  At the same time \\"General Rene Altmayer, who commanded the French V Corps ordered to support the British, was simply weeping on his bed...\\" The British evacuation from Dunkerque without informing their allies is explained away as being of little import. Mr. Beevor might be the finest war historian of the age if he could moderate his intemperate Anglocentrism.
B004WY2M8I|4.0|My husband recommended I read this series. I must say I find myself drawn into Louis's world, his perspective, his pain, his love, his losses. Excellent writing. I can't wait to finish the story.
B008OGJXJ6|2.0|Got this album as a birthday gift.  I love Bob (\\"Blood on the Tracks\\" and earlier), but I wish my wife would have just given me an Apple gift card and I could have downloaded the one or two good songs and then downloaded some older classics.  Glad he is still able to tour and play, but this album was ho-hum.  Sorry, Bob.  I still love you Man.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|like it but,  too much time and not enough coin regeneration...also too long between prize drops.bigger coins should give you more coins..
B006RXQ800|5.0|Historical fiction done at the highest level. Yes,it's not perfect but it is entertaining and thought provoking! It helps to know some real history of the period and place before seeing. Zinn's Peoples History of U.S. is a good factual \\"left\\" source for starters. Scorcese, Day-Lewis, and DiCaprio are terrific. Yes, American democracy was born in the streets.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|this game is fun and a lot harder then it looks both little and big kids will love this game it get faster and faster as you go
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My husband and I cannot stop playing this game together.  Mr. Cool who made fun of me for playing in the first place will fight for his turn Elton drop a coin.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Before reading 50 shades of grey I didn't want to be apart of all the hype so I didn't read the books for a long time. I downloaded the kindle app to my phone and read the sample just being curious. I couldn't put the book down after that. I read them all in 5 days. Gotta love it!
B006O7XOOW|5.0|We have kids around our home a lot, and most of our friends are like ourselves, young families with children under 5. We set this up in the play room for the little ones, and only 2 tots, out of maybe 10 or so showed no interest in this toy. That's a winner for me. The only downside to a toy like this are the balls, which fly every which way and get lost easily. There is enough on the toy itself to keep a baby busy for hours if they find it interesting. Packaging was unfortunately a pain. I wish they made this in the frustration free packaging. It took about 15 minutes to unpack and set up.
0345803493|1.0|One can only write so much on this topic,  How could a trilogy be created?  Is this supposed yo be a primer for someone who is interested in S&N?.  annie
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have used this calc very often since obtaining it.  It really works well and gives you a lot of information, thanks
B0070Y46UY|1.0|This type of book is not for me. I found it boring and tedious. I tried reading it for a month and often chose washing dishes over the book. I think the author promised too much. I found the plot very unengaging.  I enjoyed (sort of) the first part of the book where there was some character development but I gave up when we were at sea all those days. Tigers and hyennas are not for me.I also do not like gore and this was just too violent. I probably have not finished 5 books that I have started out of the many thousands I have read but this book was just torture. I read the last 5 chapters but just out of curiosity to see if the ending would make finishing the book worthwhile. It didn't happen.<br />The author promised it would make me believe in God.  I already believe in God but if I didn't I don't think this book would do it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|WMP is a good game, probably much better than WMW, its fun and challenging, more interactive for those who like interactive games. The game has many levels for people who like puzzles, the voices of Carl and Dr. doofensmirtz (excuse my spelling people) are cool to listen to, overall I love it.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Gone Girl was the kind of book I couldn't put down. Curiosity kept me going, as I needed to know more about the characters and desperately needed to know whodunit.  Always love a twist in a plot and this one delivers.  Recommended
B004I744AS|5.0|this is the best nonlinear dictionary I have ever used.  I can type in what I want to find instead of scrooling and scrooling and scrolling.  So much easier this way.
B006IYFCIM|3.0|This book was pretty decent until the end. Ariely blew apart his entire case when he revealed that the results were consistent across cultures in the laboratory but that that doesn't necessarily work in real life. (Brother, you said it.)<br /><br />I know that experiments have varying degrees of external validity-- but the single sentence in the last chapter that revealed that these experiments had none really defeated the purpose of the whole book for me. (I have just finished another book by Francis Fukuyama, [[ASIN:0684825252 Trust: The Social Virtues and The Creation of Prosperity]], that demonstrated the different things that some economies can produce because of varying levels of trust. So, Southern Italy produces things that are simple enough for family businesses to produce because no one can trust anyone outside of their family. But Northern Italy has a higher culture of trust and the big factories are located there.) He did the experiment with Chinese people. I happen to live in China, and have a pretty good idea that there have NEVER been three truthful consecutive statements spoken or written in the whole of Chinese history. And yet Ariely's tests find no difference.<br /><br />One more time: If the results of these experiments don't hold up to explain big, real world findings, then what is the point of the book?<br /><br />The writing itself was light and breezy. (After all, it IS a pop psychology book.) And it showed me that you can take some little concept and tweak it into a million little experiments. (Boy were those matrices well-worn!)<br /><br />Oddly enough, the book also demonstrated the wisdom of the Talmud/ Rabbinical reasoning. And that is: The purpose of all the cumbersome mitzvot is to keep people AWAY from breaking any big laws (murder, rape). So, if you decide to not eat dairy with a meat fork, then it is easier to not kill your neighbor. This book could possibly make for an interesting discussion in a study group, but not much more than that.<br /><br />Verdict: Worth a secondhand purchase. Not worth the Kindle price.that.<br /><br />Verdict: Worth a secondhand purchase. Not worth the Kindle price.
B003L77GGK|5.0|For a while I went with out getting to see this show. So I bought the whole series. I'm just missing season 7 now. I love this show! The actors, the plot, and how in some episodes they are just funny. Can't waite to buy the next instalment!

B007IXWKUK|3.0|Bought Fifty Shades Darker hoping it was better than the 1st book of the trilogy.  This book continued to push the story to the backround overshadowing it with the sexual exploits.  I was hoping to hear more story.  I will NOT abother with the last book.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|A lot of fun. A great change of pace from the types of games normally offered. A good brain boggeler for adults and math practice for kids.
B001EBWITA|4.0|I'll be the first to admit that this film is not without its faults, first and foremost being Keanu Reeves. You can tell that this casting choice was made by producers who were hoping to ride on the coat-tails of the Matrix series. Reeves' stoic performance drains the acerbic wit and douchebaggery that Hellblazer fans have come to love from John Constantine. However, we get a surprisingly good performance from Rachel Weisz, who clearly put a lot more effort into her work than Reeves. Furthermore, the film has a very solid sense of visual style, which doesn't solely depend on its visual effects. At times, it simply makes use of good cinematography and editing, which is enhanced by Brian Tyler and Klaus Badelt's refreshingly original soundtrack. Perhaps this film's strongest asset, however, is its script, which has its occasional drags and forced dialogue. However, it succeeds where many recent comic-book adaptations have failed. It gives us a fairly original story that contains some genuine surprises and some cool action. Sure, it didn't deserve any Oscars, but it was a solid B-movie that was under-appreciated for its time.
0312576463|4.0|Everything is well with the books except they are a bit dirty. And one of the books has a black ink spot at its bottom.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I bought this app for my 2 1/2 year old and he really enjoys it. It is simple and easy for him and there's no losing.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|The music is wonderful! Interesting sub plots, love Angelica and the bartender. Im a sucker for musicals,cant wait for season two!!
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|The movie is not as good as the book and this is no surprise as very few movies are.  But as I watched this with 3 family members, I found them constantly asking questions to clarify what was going on.  So while I was (as expected) disappointed by what was left out, my family was simply confused and was never able to really get absorbed into the movie as a whole.
B0090EIILU|4.0|It was pretty funny. I enjoyed watching it.  Like thhe digital downloads from Amazon you dont have to wait for it to buffer.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I enjoy this game and since it takes a while to replenish used tokens I don't spend hours on it.  Enjoyable yet addictive.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|Amazing: there is no better word to describe this series of books, let alone this one particular book. I really enjoyed reading this and couldn't wait to get my hand on the next book. This book for sure is a must read.
0345803485|3.0|I admit that, although the story seems unrealistic, I did find myself wanting to find out what the big secret with Christian Grey was.  Having read both Nine and a Half Weeks and Story of O, I felt this first book offered nothing new to the genre.  The contract Mr. Gray doled out to Anastasia (the protagonist) made me nod off; it could have been paraphrased.  Yes, this book was smutty, but since it was marketed as such, I don't feel betrayed.  It was too clinically detailed, as so much soft porn is.  But at least now I'll know what all the kids are talking about on Pinterest.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this game is good but the only thing I don't like is that you have to unlock the games with money
B008XG1X18|4.0|I loooove it ... in short. But, I think it needs to run smoother ... the site shut down too much on the Kindle Fire. Force closes too much, needs to be able to handle serious searching w/o freezing. Other than that the app itself is genius. I'm addicted to yet another social/blog ..this one is endless.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This was my least favorite installment of the Hunger Games trilogy. Weak character development and unnecessary plot twists caused this book to fall short of its two predecessors. Without giving much of the story-line away, I felt little or nothing when certain characters met their demise due to the lack of prior development, and some aspects of the plot were not vital to the story.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I haven´t finished the 3rd book yet...but am close. However, it´s a great trilogy!! Action packed with tricks up it´s sleeves. I get completly lost in the story ever time I pick it up to read. Creative, shocking, thrilling!!
B0084IG7KC|2.0|I bought this movie expecting at least for it to have some kind of spark for me. I read the series in a matter of a week and loved it. Katniss has such a strong presance in the book that I really expected for her character to have that same presance in the movie. In the movie she was just a weak shadow of the character in the book. The character Peeta was also just a weak shadow of the character in the book. I know you can't have everything that you want, but the least that you could have done is have them to portray the characters as strongly as they could have. They were fighting for their lives. These people on the screen were acting and you could tell they were acting. Something that really ticked me off was the fact that they hid her token from her district until the end of the movie. They didn't even make it a token from her district. It was actually the most important \\"image\\" from the book and they made it a hidden agenda. It was the image that made Rue know that she could trust Katniss. It was the image that became the spark of the revolution. I don't know what they have planned for movie's two and three but I actually have no plans on watching to see.
B0098VXBIA|2.0|This really is not Diez's best movie. The whole thing was just poorly put together..there  is too many stories going on at once, and in some movies that works, but in this one it just doesn't. With all the different couples and events that are going on the plot is taking away from many of the cute couples that could have had better stories. My opinion- cut a few of the couples and the movie might have actually been good.
B008133MDK|5.0|The intensity & professionalism of the actors really shines through. A modernized version of the classics without the cheesy, Hollywood angle. Loved how they depict London as it really is, diverse & teeming with energy.

B008I3QZKU|5.0|Several years, several albums, and several solo projects later, it's hard to believe that this is the band behind Hot Fuss. Indie anthems like &#34;All These Things That I've Done&#34; have been replaced with 80's-ish power ballads like &#34;Here With Me&#34;. The wild, spastic drumming of their early work has been replaced with the soft, gentle drum machine of &#34;Be Still.&#34; Even Flowers' singing itself has changed over time.  So, how good is the final product? It depends. If you were thrilled with Hot Fuss and disappointed by Sam's Town, it probably won't have much to offer you. But if Sam's Town grew on you and you enjoyed his solo album, this may be one of the best albums of the year.  Song-wise, &#34;The Rising Tide&#34; is wildly fun, &#34;Heart of a Girl&#34; is beautiful and romantic, and &#34;Be Still&#34; is as close to &#34;Only the Young&#34; as it gets. Elsewhere, &#34;Runaways&#34; is a great choice for the leadoff single, and honestly, there really isn't a bad track on this thing.  The Killers have found themselves creating quality music, and that's more than can be said by most of their peers from the mid-2000s. If you just don't get this album, stay away and listen to Hot Fuss. That was a great album. But so is this one.est Coldplay album. And honestly, there really isn't a bad track on this thing.<br /><br />Flowers' voice still strains at times, but he--and the band--sound grown up and mature. They have finally found themselves and are creating quality music, more than can be said by most of those other bands from the mid-2000s. If you can't help but think of this album as \\"slow\\" and \\"boring,\\" stay away and listen to Hot Fuss. That was a great album. But so is this one.<br /><br />-2012
B0083V2VW8|5.0|Oh Quadrophenia.....masterpiece of my youth and this new Criterion Blu Ray marks the 4th version and format that i own (VHS - VHS Extended - DVD - and now Blu-Ray). I read some of the reviews of this one before buying and some folks mentioned that the picture seems a little too tightly cropped. I too noticed this, but it's minimal and I'm really pleased with the completeness of this version (all the little scenes that are missing in the Rhino version are here), the audio is great and the picture quality (while it still remains a tad grainy from the oringinal) is excellent.<br />THere is a really nicely produced booklet that comes with this that includes the original Album story notes and some new historical pieces on the film and the disk has some cool extras including some great French footage of the Who playing in 1962/63 interspersed with interviews with various \\"out of their head\\" mods.<br />I LOVE Quadrophenia...it's just a great story of making the awkward transition from the teenage angst years to adulthood - successfully or not in Jimmy's case...for any US buyer who's not familiar with the story and the setting, I would highly recommend doing a little online research about Mods & Rockers and early 60's British youth culture. It's set in an era that's a bit hard for many Americans to grasp - one of real social upheavel and the emergence of young people as their own uniquely defined culture or sub-culture (imagine punks but instead of spiked hair and piercings, you had quaffed hairdos, smart suits and scooters)...and it makes a lot more 'sense' if you udnerstand this a bit...you'll understand what the culmination of the movie with the pitched seaside / shore battles between gangs of mods and rockers is all about.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A great book...compelling and unusual....a good diversion for all.  Thoughtfully and sensitively told and a quick but  wonderful 'read.'  Florists, gardeners and flower lovers will truly enjoy!<br /><br />Definitely add to your kindle or hold in your hand and enjoy!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is very addicting and fun. I recommend that if you are thinking of buying then buy it right now! But even though it gets annoying sometimes because you are waiting for more coins I regimens still getting it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this is a pretty played out style of game, but this is one of the best ones available. lots of fun upgrades and extras.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it to keep my knitting life in order.  I know there are more things to do with it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is very addictive. but wish the points to buy a new game didn't jump so high. I love it!
B008D28HYS|5.0|If you like this type of puzzle, you will like this one.  The color change is great and adds a twist to the game. I have a Kindle Fire, the only problem I have is the squares are hard to work with cause being smaller. Yes, I do enlarge the squares, but trying to fill in the squares, it is very touchy and will color in other squares that I did not want colored. But other than that, I like the game.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|I bought this because I love knives and it was only a couple dollars.  It does work at sharpening, but it's pretty small, so only good for smaller knives.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I don't know if its the game or my kindle but it wont let me join a game let alone load any servers! I hope it will let me in an update.
B0064Y5U24|5.0|I love the new album \\"Here and Now\\".I still think Dark Horse is better though. Looking forward to seeing them in concert again, big fan!!
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Outstanding. Probably the defiative work of historical fiction on feudal Japan. Never has the cultural differences between European and Japanese been so clearly defined. A wonderful book and an exciting read from start to finish
B009329ZF2|4.0|I was talking to some people at work about this movie. They all initially wanted to see it, but were wary because of bad reviews. I think the pro reviewers missed the mark on this one. I found the movie to be thoroughly entertaining. It was even interesting to watch the tactics of the US Navy. It was definitely a shoot-em-up raw action thriller on one hand, but also, even a little deeper than that.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I have Law Enforcement experience but no Military experience.  This  book interested me from the moment it came out, and the conflict with our Administration only fueled my interest more.<br /><br />I found the book riveting and well written.  If military exercises are of interest to you, then this is a must read.  I had some knowledge of the Mission to take Osama Bin Laden, but the book actually takes you there.<br /><br />I learned a great deal of what actually happened and why, and I have nothing but the utmost respect for our military and our soldiers who protect us and our US of A rights.<br /><br />Buy it, it's a good read and moves very quickly.<br /><br />Roadwolf
B004EPZ070|2.0|I didn't care for the story line of the movie. It seemed that they tried to hard. It definitely was not worth the $6.00 I paid for it. Maybe if it was $1, it would have been worth it. Everything in the movie revolves around sex... the whole movie! It's just stupid, not funny.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I liked the book, although it was not my favorite read.  Flynn does know how to maintain the reader's interest most of the time, but sometimes the rythm becomes too slow.
B008ULRY78|5.0|This is by far one of the best action movies I've seen in a long time. It's a must buy for anyone who loves these movies. If you think after the fist fight it couldn't get better, believe me, it does and you won't be disappointed.
B00136JPB0|5.0|Jeff is a genius. This album is heavenly. I miss him! Everyone and I mean EVERYONE should own a copy of Grace:)
0385491026|3.0|This book aroused in me an intense feeling of boredom. It's as boring as the city it's set in. Perhaps the dullest bildungsroman I've ever read. Finished it out of respect for the person who recommended it, but wow, what a slog. It would have been a much better book had she ended it when the protagonist turned ten. Seriously.<br /><br />Three stars for writerly craft. I hate myself for using that phrase.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. Fun plot, decent animation. From the trailers in the theaters it looked like it was targeted to a 3 to 7 year old crowd. The plot and action is more sophisticated than that. Passed the family chuckle and laugh test.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|GRR Martin continues the Westeros saga in this 5th installment (out of an estimated 7).  Book number 6 is expected in March 2013, and I for one can hardly wait for it.  For fantasy fans and Martin readers, \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" is more of the same great stuff that makes his work so addictive!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|You know she starts the book off by saying she is not a writer and she just wanted to get things out there to help someone else who might be having a problem like this. I have to say that this book was well written and I think she is a terrific writer. For her to be able to come forth with the horrible things that happened to her and to write them down and relive them to help others is just amazing and selfless. The horror she suffered at the hands of those two people is just unbearable. This book is heartbreaking, emotional, and educational. I learned alot from it. I really do recommend it.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Added this BBC News access app for news scanning on our Kindle Fire.  Ease to use and friendly plus has all the world news, business and sports available, too.
B008JH5CVS|5.0|it has a good story line and great action  you have space action and first person shooter action with a crime to figure out as well
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Incredible story line! I cry every time I see it. Truly amazing movie. It will tear at your heart strings every time.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Sharp objects by Gillian Flynn kept you on the edge of your seat from beginning to close to the end. Character development was amazing. Each character was very complex and dysfunctional. The ending left something to be desired. It seemed like the type of ending you give a story when it's due tomorrow and you're not close to being done. The novel didn't come full circle in my opinion and more could have been revealed.<br /><br />However, I still strongly recommend the book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|does any one know where the creepers zombies etc. are?write on this review thing.By the way if you don't know the game is great!
B00094OBS4|1.0|This is the second copy I've ordered and haven't received one yet that works!!!  I know the show is GREAT because I saw it on DIRECTV but I seem to not be able to purchase a copy that I can watch in the comfort of my home whenever I want to.  The moment I insert the disc into my BluRay it flashed INVALID!!!!

B001676320|5.0|I wanted to catch this concert when it came around but I was unemployed at the time so this is the next best thing.  I love Chicago but EW&F were fantastic.  If you can \\"sit\\" through this disc without getting up and dancing, something is WRONG with you!  Everything was spot-on...just like the CD.  The only problem I had with the Chicago portion was that Bill Champlin's singing seems to have finally started to near it's end.  In his younger days his voice really complemented the band and harmonies were much better.  Jason seems to struggle a little too but all in all they are still my favorite band that is still together today and I will catch them every time I can!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|GREAT book - the entire series is amazing.  Catching Fire was a page-turner for sure.  My only complaint has nothing to do with the book.  I am still adjusting to reading on a screen and much prefer the actual book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love the game just wish I could get coins faster without having to buy them. even my 3 year old likes to play it.
B00884GR0W|1.0|this game was complete. and total waste of money do not buy this game for your own sake it was really crap
B00932ANQM|5.0|Enjoyed this movie with my GF, highly recommended specially the mix of times of war combine with the feeling of hope!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This game is really fun. It is really time consuming though. It can get frustrating, but overall good game. This game is not for young kids, because it can get a little hard. Dont expect to finish the game anytime soon
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Hi,<br /> I do not see anything special about this book, we have all read about erotic love-making or simply sex.Nothing new here.<br /><br />  Thank you, Nurit Block
0385344333|1.0|I have read all the Reacher books and this is the worst.The plot is unbelievable and the ending the pits.It seems like his last few books have been in decline.I would much rather read Brad Thor of Vince Flynn who have strong characters,like Reacher,but are also well written.I am done buying Child's books!
0525953728|3.0|Reading the book didn't tell me anything I didn't already learn from press reports about the book or about the mission to capture/kill Bin Laden.  Neither did it tell me anything about SEAL training, organization and missions I haven't learned from reading other books. The writing was clear, but somehow it came across as bordering on vapid, but so have the other SEAL books I've read.<br /><br />Why should I have expected more? I don't know, but I definitely feel like I could have spent my money better.<br /><br />This is one book that would make a better movie.<br /><br />None of this is to take anything away from the courage and determination of the players.  On the other hand, it's clear that most of the SEALs are better used in combat than in making foreign policy decisions.
0547581033|5.0|This is a great book for parents to read to their babies.....wonderful illustrations....sturdy and large.  And later, it is a great book for young toddlers to use when they begin to read.  My little one immediately put her hands and feet on the pictures!  So cute.....
B00785P2QC|4.0|wish it didnt have goals for facebook idc for social networking sites so i cant finish the fb goals and why does certain goals have to with invest points sheesh
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game. the only thing id change is unspoiling food....you need gems to save a plate...wish it could b done with coins earned also.
B000026FJ6|1.0|the case is broken and the cd rom is scratched , look  to be in a very poor condition not very good as you claim. And this is available to all cds from you
B004UQPM4E|5.0|Una gran colección de Superman, sin duda alguna gran trabajo de Warner de entregar todo lo relacionado en un solo pack. Muy recomendable.
B008OTTRXU|5.0|My young son loves this CD. I asked him if he wanted to give it 4 stars or 5 and he said 5 so 5 stars it is.
B009329ZF2|1.0|This movie is bad on so many levels (bad acting, bad story, bad story-telling).  This movie relies entirely on special effects to make it a success.  Don't waste your time.
0446693804|3.0|I did enjoy the book though, truth be told, I think I liked the movie a lot better. A Walk to Remember is actually one of my favorite movies, and even though I've seen it at least a dozen times, I still sob like a baby every time.<br /><br />The book is a worthy read, and of course, the love story behind it is touching and beautiful, but there was something missing. Taking a step back, I definitely have to admit that while the story line was good, I felt the execution could have been a little better. For one, the characters weren't fleshed out all that much (especially the supporting ones, though even the main ones, Jamie and Landon) and I just sort of felt removed from them. There was a definite lack of passion and a bit of a disconnect. If it wasn't for the fact that I already knew them from the movie, I don't know if I would have connected with them as much.<br /><br />Also, there was barely any dialogue in the book, or romance for that matter, and there was a lot (and I mean A LOT of bible reading, lol). I don't know, it just wasn't what I was expecting I guess--definitely different. The book felt more like a long short-story...where the narrator is looking back and simply \\"telling\\" us a story, as opposed to us being IN the story and living the moments with the character--if that makes any sense. I guess it's a matter of writing style. Personally, as a reader, I prefer the latter.<br /><br />Not to mention that my absolute favorite part in the movie (how he makes her wishes come true with the telescope, and naming of the star, and being in two places at once) isn't even in the book! I was kind of surprised, and disappointed about that.<br /><br />All in all, the book was a good read and I would definitely recommend it, though if you haven't seen the movie yet, read the book FIRST, and then watch the movie--you won't be disappointed. If you're anything like me, you'll be crying during both. A lot.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|The variety of subapplications makes the app very useful.  Gaining access to the file system without having to teather to a PC is great.
B00459GJUM|4.0|Too sad they cancelled the series after this season. In season 2, the characters had developed pretty well and I had started liking Wray unlike her previous attempts of taking over the ship forcefully. The ending was sad, really sad! This series should be given more time to develop just like Atlantis. Atlantis first season was YAWN!. Season two of SGA was better, but it took them 5 seasons to become really interesting.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is a great app!! I have no problems and it almost never freezes on my kindle fire!! makes it easy to use!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was great from beginning to end!  I could not put it down.  THANK YOU, Mark Owen, for your service to our country and for getting the TRUE story out of taking out UBL.  THANK YOU to all of our American service men and women!
B003DPKCNY|5.0|I had to jump through a few hoops, but thanks to Amazon and the extemely friendly and helpful rep that solved the initial problems with buying the movie, I was able to buy it and not only enjoy it myself, but get my roommate hooked as well. This is a great bitter sweet story, definitetly worth the money.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Easier to use than the full site! I can use from my kindle fire and quickly access recipes and pins. I'm addicted!!!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Dramatic, sad plot.  Almost too many characters, but you eventually sort everyone out.  Like the fact it was narrated by two of the servants.  Secrets & events that would either surprise or shock you made for a recommended read.
B00452VF4O|4.0|A very enjoyable book.  It holds your interest.  The book creates a very good feeling for the period of history involved.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|How wonderful to hear some of the old favorites in Paul's smooth, romantic voice.  I love it that he included \\"Inchworm.\\" It was one of my favorite songs when I was a little girl.  I hope he keeps them coming.<br />Clare in Milwaukee
B00866JL96|3.0|Before I start I just want you to know I read the book prior to seeing the movie. I was so excited when I saw the trailer for this movie on TV. It looked SO good. When I watched it I was not impressed. The acting was good but the story line didnt make any sense like it did in the book. In the book everything makes sense! I really recommmend reading this book AFTER watching the movie. It explains so much more about how he came to find the picture and how Victor played a HUGE role in logans life before he went to find beth. Beths sons HATES his dad. He writes GREAT books but the movies get all messed up.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My kids loved this game and played it for hours. Very addicting and fun to play with multiple levels and items to obtain.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|First of all, I'm only halfway through the second book \\"A clash of kings\\". That having been said, this is a great epic. Written with a great sense of detail and a lot of humour (where it is needed) I think these books are way better than The Lord of the Rings are. Not that they are that comparable, but they do remind me some of one another. Great book, worth every cent.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|great book to read ,holds in suspension ,if u like science fiction u will like it ....rage against totalitarian systems will always be something u will identify with.
1439102430|3.0|I thought this story/plot line was pretty good. Kathy Reichs has some good stories in her. The other reviewers were right though, tired of the kidnapper though. What's this, like 3 times, she's been kidnapped? I just finished the new Lars Kepler book before this and I had to force myself to finish that. This I wanted to keep going back to. The dead baby part is really only at the beginning and then the story moves location/plot. Not on par with her prior stories, but overall good.
1476712042|5.0|I loved the story line and thought the book was well written. The book was addicting, I could not put it down. I can't wait for the second book!
B004LWZWBU|4.0|We enjoyed this movie so much that we bought a copy to add to our film library at the biological field station we operate in Panama.<br />Great performances by all of the cast members and an unlikely but successful combining of the talents of Steve Martin, Jack Black and Owen Wilson.  All favorites of mine and in combo they're even better.  The story starts pretty low key but the action and tension builds - yeah, this is serious birding. LOL
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! I can choose what version I want and some of them have audio, so I can listen while doing other things. It is very versitile.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|Very addictive.. the cutest app ever! Haven't had any problems as far as functionality yet (kindle fire). Can't wait to fully staff my cafe
B008MG1E4A|2.0|I hesitated before writing this review. I was put off by the cheerleading that was either in favor or against the book.The cheerleading was mostly in favor. I rely on reviews when I am considering purchasing books on the internet, especially if I am unfamiliar with the author. As a courtesy to other customers, I made the decision to review every product that I purchased in return. That is the only reason I am choosing to review this book.    This book has generated more bickering than anything written about the Palestine-Israel conflict and, believe you me, THAT topic is one of the hardest to engage in discussion about. Some say the book should not be political and that the author did not intend for it to be so. The author claims the same. But the book is political. The reaction to it by the DoD and the partisan bickering it generated among the public and within the military is proof. The content also includes political insinuation.    I do not believe in giving numbers to products while rating them. I think words speak louder than stars. However, because I have to, I am giving this book a 2 because I felt there was something deep in the author that needed to be said and he made the effort to say it. Unfortunately, he was unable to say it in a mindful way. The book is intrusive on different levels. Different sections are more poorly written than others. The book is also littered with passive aggressive comments about team mates. There is sexism, egoism, and glibness throughout. The author is unable, or maybe unwilling --who knows-- to articulate his argument with any degree of depth. That is not a criticism of him as a person, but of his authorship. He may have deeper understanding. But it is not reflected in the book.    At the beginning of the book, Bissonnette claims that the book is \\"closure\\" for his military life, that he wants to try and \\"explain\\" what motivated him and his comrades to endure constant deployments for years. On the other hand, a couple of pageslater he goes on to say: \\"Lost in the media coverage of the Bin Laden raid is why and how the mission was successful.\\" And the book \\"will finally give credit to those who earned it.\\" That the mission was a \\"team effort.\\" It is ironic that Bissonnette chose to include only CIA analysts, SEALs, and helicopter pilots as the only members who contributed to the \\"team effort.\\" President Obama, military leadership, and civilians involved in the planning apparently are not part of the \\"team effort.\\"    The title is also misleading because it sounds as if the book deals mostly with the raid on the bin Laden compound, but it does not.    The parts that I enjoyed had to do with his life as a child and his reflections. Many people unwittingly give you a glimpse of what shaped them into adulthood. Human beings are fascinating when we make the effort to understand each other. My understanding of Bissonnette the person is that he wanted to amount to something big, and the SEALs were his inspiration.    Bissonnette has been called by a few an \\"operator's operator\\" (whatever that means in a real sense). People who know him were surprised that he wrote the book. I don't buy that. People do not make a critical decision such as this out of the blue. There are probably factors that we, people outside his group of mates, are not privy to. The overall sense I got from reading the book was: he was out to pick a bone, and he picked it with everyone in veiled hostility. He praises people one minute and jabs them the next.    He portrays himself as the good guy who gives credit where credit belongs. He goes to great lengths to describe how awesome his team mates are. On the other hand \\"Charlie\\" is on the receiving end of his passive aggressive comments. Charlie is the go-getter in this bunch it seems. Charlie seems to have done much of the dangerous work on the mission as well. There is also rivalry between East and West Coast Teams. Dirty laundry is flying all over this book. I get the sense that the author feels inept or undervalued and this book may be his attempt to save face the only way he can. On at least three occasions he states \\"It didn't take long for the shit-talking to start,\\" when referring to his team mates.    The author laments the fact that he has to abide by the rules of engagement during missions. It is such an inconvenience for him to make sure that the innocents do not take the brunt of his awesome power, or that he has to arrest people instead of killing them outright. It is easier to kill people than arrest them. Isn't that why he joined?    Really dude? Yah, really?    He is a professional operator with tens of thousands of dollars' worth of high tech and killing equipment, yet he complains about having to put his plans on a power point for a presentation.    Bissonnette's behavior in the book is a classic example of might makes right.    The bra stealing incident also has to be one of those instances where you have to shake him by the shoulder \\"grow up dude.\\" People are terrified because their homes are being invaded by masked, well-armed men in the middle of the night, and the author thinks it is funny to rifle through the private belongings of a woman of the house, whose husband he just killed, to steal a bra so he can hang it on his boss's back pack. I am sure Mr. Bissonnette will not be amused one bit if an Afghan went inside his sister's house at gunpoint and rifled through her underclothes, while his sister's husband is lying on the floor with his brains blown out.    Bissonnette also offers one of his precious insights while his helicopter is taking off. This shows his contempt for \\"V.I.P.s\\" and women specifically: \\"---the rotors kicked up a maelstrom or rocks and dust, blasting, the VIPs and forcing them to run in the opposite direction. I chuckled as I watched a few of the women stagger away on their heels.\\"    Again, really, dude? Is that what people are to you?    The book is full of incidents and jabs such as the above. All such comments were not an essential part of the book and could have been left out. I am almost certain that Bissonnette has other motives besides setting the \\"record straight.\\" Or, maybe that was the record he was talking about?    Being a civilian, I cannot judge if the tactical and logistical information shared in the book is damaging, but I did feel uneasy reading some of it. There was too much small detail that, when put together, can give an idea about some of the tactics currently in use. Bissonnette also seems to take liberties about telling us how his team mates feel. This is not a good thing. We may not know who they are, but others do.    I had read \\"SEAL Target Geronimo\\" by Chuck Pfarer recently and Pfarrer's description of the raid contradicts Bissonnette's. In an interview, Pfarrer claims that Bissonnette is lying:    [...]    The reality is we will never know what actually happened. But we can learn to discern some things by reading different sources.    Another source for some background information is \\"No Easy Op\\" by Brandon Webb et. al.    http://www.amazon.com/No-Easy-Unclassified-Detailing-ebook/dp/B0095BXK66/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1348459530&sr=8-1&keywords=no+easy+op    There is much reproachfulness and soul searching going on in the Special Forces community right now. The military has been used as a recruitment tool and, once that line is crossed, it can be difficult to stop. I think human beings have a need to be acknowledged for the good things they do. The SEALs are in a tough situation because their work is secretive and their work is their reward. Not everyone can live according to that standard. The questions to ask are:    Is there something that the community can do to provide moral support for its members who are having difficulty?    Can the tradition of shunning people be examined?    It is a forceful and competitive community due to the nature of the work. Are there avenues for them to be acknowledged for the work they dowithout jeopardizing security?    Our military is a reflection of the larger society. We are becoming increasingly self-absorbed with our might. We are a vengeful society that preaches democracy and mercy to others, but we are short in the area of practice when it comes to our actions. Mercy is a good quality to have towards one's own and one's adversaries. We become better people by it. Duty and honor are good qualities, but they have to be tempered with mercy. Mercy is what prevents vengeance. The taking of human life may be necessary at times, but it must never be treated lightly or with contempt, no matter who that life is.    Bissonnette did not even approach such subjects. His account is more descriptive than reflective. It is a good read in some parts if you like the details of missions, but it is worthless when it comes to good information and insight. I felt sad for the author more than anything else because he was the catalyst that is bringing this controversy to light and his life may never be the same.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|Neil Gaiman's forte seems to be writing excellent fairy tale worlds for grown-ups.  \\"Stardust\\" is another example of that.  Once again he's used wonderful writing to produce a world, story and characters that are truly enjoyable.  It's especially interesting how he manages to keep a fairy tale \\"feel\\" to the story while making it for adults.  I rate it at an Excellent 5 stars out of 5.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|My kids can't stop playing this. We have had it on the DS for a while, and I figured I'd get a copy for my phone, for the odd restraunt/car ride. Graphics are much nicer than the DS, and the gameplay is terrific.
B008M36ER0|5.0|Really great movie.  Obviously with the liberal media stepping all over themselves to ruin Mel Gibson's career he has not been given the kind of roles lately that his talent as an actor would otherwise warrant.  He was no doubt given this role in a Freudian hope to further damage his public persona.  Despite all the bad press and the mess he manages to make of his personal life from time to time (as most of Hollywood eventually does by the way) he takes the darkness of this movie and wraps it around himself as a blanket.  Behind the grit and sarcasm of his character he manages to show a heart down underneath it all as only Mel can do.  He takes you along with him to a place few would ever want to visit and yet you find yourself strangely engrossed in his predicament. It is a terrific ride and certainly not what you would expect it to be.  Well worth the watch!
B006O7XOOW|5.0|This is a really cute ball toy that encourages pulling up for infants and young toddlers.  It is brightly-colored and plays music and sounds.  When you spin the wheel at the top, the 'volcano' part rises and the balls will go down the various legs.  An unfortunate aspect of this toy is that the balls are meant to go into the cups at the bottom of the legs, but half the time they don't do this and will roll away from the toy.  If you have ever had a ball toy before, you know how hard it is not to lose the balls, and this just makes it more difficult.  Other than that, this is a really cute toy.  My one-year-old daughter loves to pull up on it and spin the wheel and the other spinning toy on the side.  My three-year-old son also likes playing with it.  It seems pretty durable and is sturdy when my daughter uses it to stand.  It was a little tricky to put together, but not too bad.  Overall, this is a cute toy and I recommend it for infants and young toddlers.
B0090EIC3Y|1.0|This movie was such a disappointment.  To go from Borak to this is a complete embarrassment.  What few funny things were in the movie was part of the commercials and trailers.  Don't waste your time, it will be on Netflix for free or in the bargain movie bin at Walmart within a year.  It makes Dumb & Dumber look like an academy award picture.
B005M68S4W|5.0|I was a little apprehensive about ordering a Tony Bennett download since he was more popular during my parents time than mine.  However, I loved the people he was doing the duets with, so I ordered it.  I was not disappointed!  Mr. Bennett's voice is still rich and true and each of his duet partners brought a unique musical melding to each song.  I am totally enjoying this download and have made a CD for my car.  It's soothing, fun, and nostolgic!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I really want to like this game, as I'm a big fan of the original Oregon Trail from the days of the Commodore-64. But while this game has excellent graphics and can be interesting, it is far too reliant on the friends/neighbor concept that plagues most Facebook games nowadays. I really don't want to join another social/gaming network just to get ahead in this game. At the moment, gameplay is still \\"quaint,\\" but if there's too much more of the neighbor/friend-necessitant rewards, it will become tedious and deleted soon afterwards.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This game was so fun. I never had a problem with it. I liked it just as much as angry birds. I would recommend thus to anyone.
B008X8P8A8|5.0|I really like this game for its excellent graphics and battles. it is not supposed to be like total war, its just from the makers. you set up buildings and receive resources from them allowing you to make units. both buildings and units take real time to create. I personally really like this game for something different. it surely definitely is Not worth only 1 star.
159514188X|5.0|I got this book at a bookstore in a small town and stayed up late to finish in just a day or two. This is a wonderful book. I can't wait to read other books from Jay Asher. It's a book I'd recommend to people who like suspenseful mysteries. It is also probably my favorite books, and coming from me, well let's just say I read a lot of good books so I can never pick a favorite because I LOVE all the books I read.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|As an avid mystery and detective story fan,  I was quite disappointed.  Yes,  you keep reading to see what happens,  but really not worth the read.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is even more fun than the last one. They out did themselves on this one. I love it.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I have both Pc and xbox edition, and this kind of really sucks comparatively. I really don't think of the as an alternative.
B0027MJU00|4.0|i liked it... the title is true to the story. very dark places! enjoyed it way more than gone girl, i find the main character flawed but still likable because you get where that is coming from... next: sharp objects!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|so cool I love this. but I especially love making the money$$$$$$$$$$$$!!!!!!!!!!!!rate back at it I also love<br />how its like a county fair. Keeping it real with classic games
B004XVN1T4|5.0|Ken Follett has a way of getting you involved with the characters on a personal basis and yet you learn about the history associated with the era.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the kindle Bible. I would recommend this Bible for you to use too. I think that it just inspires you.
B0031TZ8TU|5.0|this book was about the period when the Shah was being ousted.  I had forgotten about Ross Perot's executives being detained in prison for no charged offense.  I really learned a lot from this book about that period of time.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|i like this app because it lets me set a my fav song to play at the time i set its soo awesome i love it!
B008ASLK8A|4.0|Enjoyable movie and great acting!<br />Kind of like a very old 007 movie.<br />It would be nice to see a third.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|very great battery reminder.  allows you to know when you are about to run out of battery life. recommend to others.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|kinda hard to get into but once the book really got going i couldn't put it down. im half way through the second book and i can't put it down either.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great on the Kindle Fire.  No problems with game play, but using my stylus is a must.  Challenging,  yet fun to play.  Can't wait for the next installment.  Please hurry!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|\\"The Kitchen House\\" by Kathleen Grisson, is a must if you enjoyed \\"The Help\\"  I found it to be a page turner. She made you feel a part of the story, very well written. I have recommened this book to all my family and friends.
B00002SSKI|5.0|Ordered this as a replacement for one never returned to me after it was lent out. Love this movie. Great depiction of the 70s era. Great story and all-star cast.
B0091REZMW|2.0|good game but they charge crazy money to buy diamonds needed to play<br /><br /> the game is fun but they should make it so you can purchase your energy with game gold
B0055SWM08|5.0|Good game that makes you think. It was a good thing that there is a hint button for some levels.
B007ELN8Y8|2.0|After watching this Academy award winner, the four of us looked at each other with a group \\"huh.\\" We unanimously felt there had to be more to it. The gimmick of the silent and black and white film wore thin real quick, and was done much more humorously in Mel Brooks \\"Silent Movie.\\" That movie was funny! \\"Singing in the Rain\\" dealt with the transition period from the silent-to-talkies with far greater skill (music, dancing, humour etc.....) The dog in the Artist was truly the highlight of the film....Must have been a real slow year for films.....
B0000639FE|3.0|the item, Jerry Maguire movie, was in good shape, but it took so long to receive it that i forgot i even placed the order!!!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Considering the fact that this series is based off of a series of books, it's VERY well done. If you like shows like Rome and The Tudors, you will love this show. It's based on an imaginary land in a time where kings ruled, and wars were fought on horseback. Both the show and the books are full of betrayal, backstabbing, drama, and epic battles... must see!!!
B008TMA1LY|5.0|This is to the individual complaint about the app stealing their $12.00. I have purchased things in app before and not received it. I have emailed Amazon and never have a problem about getting a refund. As for kids pushing icons to purchase things, you can configure your account to need a password or pin before real money is spent. If your child is small enough that they randomly push buttons, maybe you need to supervise them.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Me before you was a fantastic read, a real page turner. The relationship between a carer and a truly troubled and broken young man who once lived a full and fantastic life but due to a terrible accident is just a shell. Tears and a heartwarming read. You wont want it to end.
0345803485|5.0|What a invigorating read that stimulates your emotion and senses. It's difficult to put down once you start reading.  This book can change the way you view relationship and guide you to develope a passionate one in real life.
B0018AOA0C|5.0|Very cheap for a very underrated album. If you like rock and have never heard of these guys check this out.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I have never had the problem of being so enthralled with a book that I couldn't put it down until I read Hunger Games. Funny thing is I had already seen the movie! This book is a testament to the fact that books are always better than film adaptations.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|&ntilde;eeds more upgrades and wepons pets that fallow you in the game like dragons,. to make your own person ya.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|The second installment serves its purpose, to bridge the first and last book, but it is a bit slow with the majority of the book drawn out on them almost, but not quite catching up with each other.  New, key information is revealed, which makes it a must read in the series, but don't expect many plot line questions to be fully resolved.  Even with a slower second book, I am still very much looking towards the final installment!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I've been a fan since season 1.  The end of Season three reveals the suggested fate of Jax's father in letters which Tara reads(which plays a major role in season 4).<br /><br />  I was estatic to get the fourth installment of Sons of Anarchy.  From start to finish, not one bad episode!<br />With new law enforcement in Charming headed by LT. Roosevelt, U.S. Attorney Lincoln Potter teaming up with LT. Roosevelt, Dealing with gun running & drug trafficing with Romeo, Juicy facing pressure from the law about his past, Russian mob, Irish cartel, & topping it off with Gemma and Clays fears of the Piney & Tara's knowledge of the letters proves to be some of the best writing of the season yet.<br /><br />These events really put on the pressure developing friction within the club.  These events put such a strain on the club, it shows how members, such as Clay, will do what it takes to stay ahead.  Even in the end there are those who can't escape what it buried in the past, & there are those that can only delay the inevitable.  There are those whose fates are just around the corner.<br /><br />There is so much ground this season covers, I probably didn't do this review justice.<br /><br />My only complaint is the DVD itself.  I noticed that the subtitles tend to freeze a couple of times on a couple of episodes.  It doesn't bother me, but it could be a problem for the hearing impaired.  I actually give this 4.5 out of 5 stars becuase of this.  Other than that, a great addition to the DVD collection.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|No easy day is worth reding should special forces be already of readers interest. However, the whole story stays at a long distance from detail. Bin Laden raid is well described at the end of the book. Otherwise the content is quite light.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I watched the movie before I read the book.  I was suprised to find out the lead character's name was Logan as I have a brother named Logan in the military.  Eventhough I watched the movie, the book kept me on my toes.  I loved almost all of the characters in the story.  Great book, I highly recommend.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really love this game...addictive! I have to control my patience when I run out of coins but it is a blast!!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|the movie was well made but of course I know that every little thing cannot be incorporated into a film, I did enjoy it though.  Looking forward to the second one.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|love the syncing.  It's very flexible.  The list capability helped get all party details accomplished.  The web clipper adds more strength to sharing info.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|My family and I enjoyed this film. We are not huge fans of nor dislike any actors in the film so I cannot comment on anyone's performance. What I will say is that this film effectively and interestingly told a story by taking you through the adventure of Snow White's escape and defeat of the evil queen. I have read other's reviews and I get a real sense that people were wanting more substance in this film but I believe the substance was already there. It was present in the very fact that this is a well-known story. Most of us are quite familiar with the tale and didn't need to have every nuance explained, re-invented and/or re-interpreted. This story showed more of the evil queen's side and even hinted to the audience a back-story as to why she is so evil and powerful. That direction usually gets left out in things I've seen previously. It would be great to see a prequel at some point just about the queen and the events that led her to live such a scorned life.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Tells it like it is!  This book details the dangers that these warriors live with everyday.  Makes you proud to be an American.
034580404X|1.0|All the noise about these series is just very clever advertisement! The book was so boring and so cheesy unbelievable that I had to skip pages to just see what finally happens and what all the noise was about. I did finish the first book and found myself struggling with boredom reading the second... I asked my girlfriend to just summarize what happened in the second and third book. I was very disappointed in the books and glad I borrowed them and didn't waste my money.
B005LAIGPA|5.0|--------------------------------------------------------------<br />\\"Chronicle\\"<br />(20th Century Fox, 2012)<br />--------------------------------------------------------------<br />This is a thoughtful and worthy addition to the \\"superhero\\" movie genre, an indie-ish, low-budget art film exploring what might happen if three average American highschool kids, pumped full of hormones, angst and inexperience, were suddenly given metahuman powers, if comicbook myth met everyday reality. The film is part of the growing number of stories that deconstruct the superhero ideal -- in print, titles like \\"Irredeemable,\\" \\"Marvelman\\" and \\"Invincible\\" come to mind, while in filmland, this falls somewhere between the gratuitous gore of \\"Kickass\\" and flawed-hero origin stories such as \\"Hancock\\" or \\"Unbreakable.\\"<br /><br />I thought the film was well done and intelligent - it's understandable that many Amazon users have given this bad ratings, since they probably aren't used to seeing low-budget films and expect everything to be high-tech and CGI-ed out. But for viewers who are willing to forgive special effects that are roughly equivalent to those of TV's \\"Heroes\\" series, this film offers a strong, unsettling script and three characters whose actions and reactions are completely believable. I, for one, wouldn't mind a sequel to see where the story goes from here. Not the greatest movie ever, but definitely worth a whirl. Probably really a 4-star movie, but I wanted to help make up for the predictable one-star flame reviews. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)
B005LLSNNE|4.0|This show is like a car wreck...you can't help but watch it even when it is extremely graphic!  It is a great show, just hope they do not keep going so long between seasons.  It is great being able to watch them the way you want after purchasing them.
0739359320|4.0|We enjoyed listing to this book in the car.  It was well done and kept us wanting to hear more.
B008133DO8|5.0|At first I balked at the $4.99 per episode price tag but this one was well worth the price. Sherlock must face many nemeses, particularly that most hated one: emotions. This series just keeps getting better.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game. it is the best. I started playing 2 days ago and am already on level 35. its so addictive.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Okay, this is not the sparkling wit of the Algonquin round table. And yes, it does veer toward the kind of gross, pre-teen humor that puts off a lot of people, including me.<br /><br />But boy, this is one funny movie. It begins in what the filmmakers describe as \\"every American's image of Paris\\"- a city block containing every major tourist attraction in the city- and from there it turns into the ultimate Jerry Bruckheimer movie... if Jerry Bruckheimer made movies with puppets. If you were a kid in the 1960s who grew up with shows like FIreball XL5, Supercar, and Thunderbirds Are Go, you'll laugh with recognition at the characters who populate this movie. What makes it work is that the filmmakers play it perfectly straight, honoring every cliche of those great TV shows (and the Bruckheimer movies) while having their marionettes indulge in wild sex and the kind of bloody violence that would never have passed muster on a 60s kiddie show.<br /><br />Where it really works for me is the broad parodies of contemporary culture and world affairs. There's a viciously funny parody of \\"Rent\\" that features the lead singing a song called \\"Everybody Gets Aids\\". Mean? Perhaps. But a great send up of what's become a theatrical cliche. And it's nothing compared to the shots the movie takes at Hollywood and politicians. I don't think I'll ever be able to get the images of a puppet Kim Il Jong singing \\"I'm so ronrey!\\" out of my head.
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|I don't normally watch or, if I do watch, enjoy remakes of classic 80's movies.  I was a teenager in the 80's and watched most of the 80's classics either at the movie theater on dates, at the drive-in with six of my friends crammed in the car, or on the new fangled VHS video tapes.  Life was good back then... Ahem anyway, I dislike most remakes because they just plunk hot, new starlets (male and female) into my beloved old movie and bring nothing new to the role or story line.  My thinking has always been why watch the remake when I can watch the original?<br /><br />I loved the first Fright Night.  It has remained in my top 5 movies of all time for many years.  Vampires were still scary and not all sparkly and brooding back then.  So it was with great trepidation that I watched this remake.  Man I am so glad I did!<br /><br />*SPOILERS * SPOILERS * SPOILERS *<br /><br />The new movie pays homage to the first movie by keeping everyone's name the same, keeping many of the key plot points, and using many of the same scenes from the first movie.  The new movie includes current events and uses them to explain some plot points which were lacking in the first movie.  For example:<br /><br />-When people start disappearing in the neighborhood, the neighbors just assume the people lost their house due to the economy and left town.<br /><br />-To explain why Jerry (a vampire named Jerry!) is not seen during the day and why his windows are blacked out, the writers set the story in Vegas so he just tells anyone who asks that he works on the strip at night and sleeps all day.  Brilliant!<br /><br />-The missing prostitute from the first movie is now a neighbor who is a stripper.  Lots of strippers in Vegas and making her the missing person makes much more sense as to why Charlie goes into Jerry's house looking for her.<br /><br />-Fright Night is no longer a campy local T.V. show.  Now it's a campy Las Vegas \\"magic show\\" ala Chris Angel.<br /><br />This remake has the perfectbalance of the original plot and enough new scenes to keep it fresh and interesting.  Also LOVED the cameo by the original Jerry.  This is how it's suppose to remakes are suppose to be done.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|Saw the movie Searching For Sugarman... got home and bought this. Was not disappointed. Been listening often for about two weeks. Really glad to have found Rodriguez!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Reminded me of the book The Lottery.  A little predictable but I enjoyed it. I will read the next one.
1476712042|5.0|This book was amazing, a love story with some twists, I couldn't put it down.<br />I can not wait for walking disaster, already have it pre-ordered.<br />I'm a super slow reader and read this book in 1 day.<br />Do yourself a favor and order this book, i'm telling you it is worth it.<br />Suggesting it to all my friends.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This app is a lot of fun and passes a lot of time. I totally reccomend it you buy it for yourself and your kids. :)
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Great continuation of a classic game. Both my 12 year old and I enjoy seeing what new areas we can open and explore.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|Still Alice is a wonderfully written book, written from the stand point of an influencial and well educated woman who is suffering from early onset Alzheimers disease.  The progress of the disease, and frustration caused within the family by this debilitating condition, is both sad and encouraging.  I loved the book and would recommend it to anyone, whether you are approaching middle age yourself or perhaps have a family member similarly diagnosed.  An eye opener.
B006LSZECO|5.0|My husband and I rarely like the same books so when he recommended Gone Girl, I was a bit hesitant.  I read the first page and was hooked.  I'm nearly through but am going slowly because I've yet to figure out the ending (I think) and then...what will I read next?  This book is wonderful and I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes a movie.  Just beware that once you start it, you won't be able to put down.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|So far so good - I have not finished the book but it is keeping me engaged. Hopefullu I will find time to continue reading it at a rapid pace.
B005POK858|5.0|Forget Final Fantasy Dimensions. At 1/10 the price this game is just as enjoyable. Sure the sound effects and language translation could use a little polish but aside from that this is classic RPG perfection. I just wish there were more control options like touch where you want to go instead of the dpad.
0525953728|3.0|I give this book a C-.  I think Owen did  not do justice to the Seals or for that matter himself.  He gave away a lot of information, in my opinion and i think he kind of took away some of the mystique of the Navy SEAL operation.  But, I did enjoy reading his part of the actual raid itself and his frank, and I hope, honest, telling of the events.  I was surprised at the way Osama went down and was glad it was told as it was rather than what the administration's story was.  If you buy the book, which i would not recommend, start on page 197 as that is where the action starts.  Anything before that is just fluff.
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|Forget about Final Fantasy dimensions this game is fantastic sure the sound affects in language translation could use a little polish but other than that this is Rpg classic gaming perfection. Runs smooth as silk.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Excellent for $30 to go along with Season One just in time for a \\"Walking Dead\\" marathon before the third season
B0068G6M8E|5.0|Great series, dirty, gritty with a great cast & some of the best tunes out there! I look forward to every episode .
B004M3GDI4|4.0|This is a quality Petzl light.<br />It is a bit heavy for Light backpacking but is a very user friendly light with good power levels.<br />Useful accessory especially for hemets.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch Albom is always a good read. I enjoy his books while reading them but the part I like best is they stay with you and you reflect on them many times throughout your life. Typically I don't read a book more than once. This one I could read again!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Not as intense as the other two books in the trilogy. I have 10% of the book left to read and am enjoying it.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|was like reading a good mystery,  i could not put it down.  great graphics. and story. I was sad when it was over.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|Lots of fun. The puzzles makes you think in a creative way. Try it out each game is quick and can be addictive
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app its way better than the regular site. its so easy to use and navigate ....I have it on my phone and my kindle . cant live without it.love love love it....
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was great! Loved all three, very addicting. Well written, I would recommend reading the books before watching the movies, you will learn so much more.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I enjoyed the background information and the actual story of the raid. While the story was on the edge of revealing too much, I do not believe it did so; especially in view of the fact that the President of the United States had already revealed far too much for his own political purposes well before the Intel Community had a chance to exploit the treasure trove of valuable information on the Al Qaeda organization and its members.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I think this was the best book out of the three, very addicting. I can't wait for the movie. Great Ending!
B0094KF4WG|4.0|Definitely recommended and most profits going to charity.<br />Fascinating account from the inside. Very  easy to read.<br /><br /> Thank you to the author  for sharing his story, and the work done in his day job.
B007KZY1YY|2.0|What is about these books, that keeps you reading and hooked?  This book is not what I anticipated.  I loved the 'triology' theory.  Would I recommend this book yes and no.
B004AQR24W|4.0|Great Action Movie!!! This is the third time watching this movie in 2 years. Still love the none stop storyline...
B002XTBE6K|4.0|This Emma is more fun and more understanding.  The cast is perfect, Romola Garai is perfect as  Emma Woodhouse, Jonny Lee Miller as Mr. Knightley. I gave it four stars because the very end is not enough pomp for four episodes. With all the great language included. There are balls and more along the line of those Jane Austen may have attended. Lovely!!!!!
B00881VLCE|5.0|Loads of fun!! Lots of puzzles to choose from, easy to move the puzzle pieces. I also like being able to choose how many puzzle pieces I want to use.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have been waiting forever for this app. I think 7 bucks for the app isn't too bad,  considering the PC version is 27. App works well on the Kindle Fire, so I don't know what all these negative reviews are for....
B008XG1X18|5.0|always on it!! easy to use!! totally even more addicting than the real website!! I use this more than face book!!
B008BM9L72|4.0|Well the girl she goes bang - very readable and enticing love story with a twist or ten. A life changing read for all woman and men who want to improve their relationships.

0399156704|4.0|good story of a pet trainer that instructs pet owner's dogs in obediance and Search & Rescue of Human beings.<br />Nice mystery and romance novel as well.  Story moves well and an excellent \\"page-turner.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game.  the only thing I do not understand are the 4 stars above where the coins drop.  they flash on when you drop the coins buy I do not know what the stars mean. any ideas?
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I made a point to read this book and I finished the book yesterday. I had to read it because of all the hype. It is written in John Q. Public language; very easy read and; for myself at least, held my interest.<br /><br />He makes the point overall that everything can be politicized.  Obama takes credit for what he and his team accomplished; along with all those involved in the research and planning.<br /><br />Don't judge him.  He is correct. Remember: \\"Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive\\"
B008MG1E4A|4.0|While the title showcases the Bin Laden mission, the majority of the book is devoted to an overview of the life of a Seal.  The book recounts the author's Seal tenure and offers insight into life as a Seal and the sacrifices that he and his colleagues endure to serve their country.  It offers slightly more details into the Bin Laden than has been in the press.<br /><br />Overall it is an easy read.  If you are looking for a great deal of mission details this probably isn't the book for you.<br /><br />As an avid reader of World War II and Civil War histories, I found the book to be a worthwhile read.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|i like hack and slash rpgs so this one does the trick for me,itd be easier wit abetter touch direction control but oh well
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Just like Half Brick Studios \\"Fruit Ninja\\" this game is a great combination of short play with addictive elements that keep you coming back. Also it's free to play, with optional in app purchases. I'm sure this will be an app I keep going back to again and again, unlike most that I rarely revisit after the 1st week.
B0037BB00I|5.0|This MP3 download of the CD from Adele has not diappointed me. She is a great singer & her music is spectacular. Everyone who enjoys Adele's music should also love this one.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I started reading the book and though I was into much of it. But I was really wrong... after the first chapter flew by, I could not get my hands off the book and wanted more.
B00422LESO|5.0|This was a very good book. I would highly recommend it to anyone. It's fast paced and funny too. If you like regency era books with a twist in the current time then this is for you. I can't wait to read the next in the series.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|With a smart tutorial, you are lead into a great battle.<br />Loading times are slow but the game does not freeze on my kindle and is worth the wait.<br />The music is outstanding.<br />Like all glu games, this one lets you buy enhancements but you can still play the free version until you reach your limit.<br />If you like a good fight this is for you.
0345803507|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book because it brought the whole series together. The first book was mostly about sex while the second book was mostly about sex with a hint of a twist in the plot. Fifty Shades Freed brought out more of that plot and brought something to the book other than sex.<br /><br />Fifty Shades Freed is about how Ana and Christian's relationship develops more into an emotional relationship rather than just a sexual one. The couple work together to try to bring out the best in each other while uncovering their dark pasts. Ana and Christian are tested as a couple emotionally, physically, and through life threatening situations. I liked the fact that they had their ups and downs yet stuck together in the end because of their unconditionally love and passion for one another.<br /><br />Although I enjoyed reading this book along with the rest of the trilogy, I wish we had more insight on what Christian's thoughts were and his perspective of everything. Throughout the book we got to see Ana's perspective on every situation and how she felt or what was going through her head at that present moment. I wish we got to experience more of Christian's point of view instead of just Ana's.<br /><br />This book really kept you on the edge of your seat and was mostly unpredictable. I really enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend this to those who want to experience a mix of love and passion with a twist of action and mystery. However, I wouldn't recommend this book to people underage because of the extremity of sexual content.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Need I need to say anything more other bawse! And yes. this is how you spell bawse. Don't ask anymore.
B006IW8DJE|1.0|It's maudlin, trite and ridiculous. Save your money and give this weepy piece of crap flic a miss. The situation is absurd, the characters are cardboard cliches, the acting's by-the-numbers and to top it off there's even an appearance of a geriatric Rocker to help save the day. But wait, there's more! How about an old fashioned deus ex machina medical miracle to make us feel all warm and tingly? Cue the violins.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This has come in so handy in meetings where I get emailed documents but don't have time to print and don't have a laptop with me. I bring up up on my phone. Very cool and my EVO 3D handles it all with no problem. Save docs from here to cloud or computer to cloud and very easy to retrieve.

B000ICXQXS|5.0|The Sting has been one of my favorite movies since watching it with my dad as a kid!  Robert Redford and Paul Newman together is always a happy event!  If you enjoy films that involve grifts of any kind, this is the mother of all of them.  Enjoy!
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Our grandchildren were visiting for the weekend. The Lorax arrived Friday and they loved it. We actually watched it it again. It is a great movie for the entire family.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|This book is not your typical Stephen King read. However, it is still wonderfully written.  I could not put it down until it was done.  Not your typical time-travel novel (but is there really one?).  Still thinking about this book and I finished it last week.  Would highly recommend it to any and all!  ...thank you Mr. King for a non-creepy novel!!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|The game is fun and easy to operate. Very responsive. Can be repetitive and is possible to play without spending real money.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|I really enjoyed the political analysis contained within the rich tapestry of the lives of the main characters. This was a page turning whilst educational read!
B009329ZF2|5.0|Wow this was slightly different than I expected from a popular game. I never would have thought to throw some aliens in the mix of things but it works and well I might add.  Two thumbs up!
B007R12TNQ|5.0|These little guys are still grabbing the hearts of millions.  My son enjoys the chipmunks and this movie was a hit in my house whole.

B004GBIE3Y|5.0|my husband and I both liked this movie a great deal.  we did not know what to expect, since we had never heard of it, but we were glad that we watched it.  We are all a little crazy sometimes, and struggling to get through our lives, and be happy.  This movie will inspire you, and make you feel good.
0385344333|1.0|I am a dyed-in-the-wool Lee Child reader. I have read every book he has published. Never in a hundred years did I think I might ever write a one star review of a Reacher book. Sorry but this book was a real downer. Lee Child seemed to be looking for words so he repeated himself time and time again. The story line was great, but it was like reading a short story stretched into a novel. This guy is a good writer. Reading this book has not changed my mind about that. He needs to go back and read some of his early successes and try again. I'm waiting on his next one.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|I used to be a big fan of the X-Files.  When I first started watching this film, the mood and direction reminded me of that series quite a bit, which caught my attention.<br /><br />I also screened the original \\"Let the Right One In,\\" which I really liked.  But I liked this film even more.  I think that it came down to the acting for me; the leads in this film I thought were just better than the leads in the foreign film.  But both films are excellent so you really can't go wrong either way.<br /><br />I could go on and on about the plot, but I find that a little boring.  I would rather discuss what I believed this film was trying to say.  Or rather make that, what question was this film asking of the viewer.  For me, what I thought about was this:  what would I be willing to do for love?  How far would I be willing to go?<br /><br />The setup in this movie was terrific in the sense that, even though the Chloe Moretz character could be argued as evil (I don't think that I'm giving anything away there) you can completely understand why the Kodi Smit-McPhee character was still in \\"love\\" with her.  (You might be tempted to argue, \\"They're too young to be in love,\\" and you might have a point.  But I'm not much interested in semantics here so call it what you will.)  He's a loner, she may as well be a loner, and they both have something that the other needs.  And they both connect and understand each other in some fairly unexpected ways.<br /><br />It has been a while since I've seen this, but I've seen it twice.  From what I remember, there is a scene where Mr. McPhee was sitting in class while they were discussing the film \\"Romeo and Juliet.\\"  This itself could be argued to be a Romeo-and-Juliet tale itself - he's a mere mortal and she's a, well, you'll find out, and they have standard difficulties just hooking up - although the ending might just surprise you.
B008JAFXOQ|1.0|Avoid this movie at all costs! The anti-heroine is completely not credible as a high school junior, and the moral issues raised by the initial accident are never even remotely resolved. And, you will fall deeply asleep waiting for all of this to be worked out by a director who never figured out what sort of movie he was making. I want my money back!
B008SVFX96|4.0|Richie Sambora inspired me to pick up the guitar in the early nineties (still got his signature strat to prove it!) and while he lost me as a devotee from Crush onwards, I'll always have a soft spot for him. So while I didn't really know what to expect with this new solo effort, I went ahead and pre-ordered it anyway, and I'm more than happy with the result! It's not really groundbreaking songwriting (although there certainly are some surprises) and it is not a return to the kind of melodic riff-based playing which to me peaked on Stranger In This Town, but it's a very solid collection and I already like this record a lot more than Undiscovered Soul and pretty much all BJ output after '95. It's a mature and very personal album, dealing lyrically with all the stuff he's been going through the past couple of years (guess the album title already hinted at that...) and obviously that sets the mood. But he has managed to come up with a mix of energetic and atmospheric songs that taken together works well for me.  Songs like Burn the Candle Down, Nowadays (bit of Foo Fighters?), Sugar Daddy and Learning How to Fly are great rockers and I'm happy to finally hear a bit of interesting soloing in his playing again. Still not that crazy about his chord-slamming rhythm playing, and not my preferred guitar tone but I can live with that! Every Road is a great song, and while the other songs are at times a bit patchy, I'm already starting to warm up to them and I'm sure they'll keep growing on me as the inspired moments tend to outweigh the shaky bits. Last thing to mention is that Sambora's unique voice is greatly suited for the kind of heartfelt introspective songs that are spread out over the album.<br />Sounds to me like he's on the way back!

B000LXH11C|4.0|The Essential Alan Parsons Project contains several key cuts from all of the studio albums from the duo plus a previously unreleased Eric Woolfson number, all tracks remastered by Parsons himself across 2 discs.<br /><br />This compilation does well in presenting those songs that work out as singles and yet compliment each other to summarize their respective concept albums.<br /><br />After all, the Project's entire repertoire consists of songs that aren't too strictly conceptual, unlike a prog-rock album, most being on the 3 min pop rock format, yet still complex and intellectual enough to shy away from soft rock territory.<br /><br />Having said that, in such compromise between singles and album works, the listener is bound to be inclined to either of these realms at one point or the other, leaving the full Alan Parsons' Project experience as a choice between either pop hits (the [[ASIN:B00000JJKJ Arista Heritage]] disc being a good example) or the respective individual albums.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|When I got this book, my expectations weren't too high. A lot of sci-fi/horror I've read recently has been borderline crap. But Wool was a surprisingly good read. Howey creates such an atmosphere of excitement coupled with claustrophobia and exhaustion that you get sucked in. It makes you root for the underdog in a very understated manner. The language is simple and as read you don't really care what happened to get humanity to live in underground silos. You just want to know what happens next. The character development is also quite powerful. You get involved in their lives and struggles. I agree with some of the reviewers here who say that this could be a cult classic. Great read!
B000PATZQK|5.0|Odessey & Oracle is one of the few prime musical examples of the decline, in mood and ideology, of the 60s' as a decade.<br /><br />Along its 12 tracks, its unique breadth of contemplative, somber pop visions by the pens of Argent and White, reflect the waiting point at the end of the 'flower power' social phenomenon, self confident of its end but without the prophetic semblance of a similar work by Love, [[ASIN:B000058983 Forever Changes]].<br /><br />Its still undeniably in tune with the musical trends of the zeitgeist; packed with gorgeous vocal harmonies a la Beach Boys and themes of abstract, psychedelic metaphors, but filtered through the bittersweet melancholy of a funeral, amidst its church organs, heavy mellotron riffs, and fragile storytelling courtesy of Collin Blunstone.<br /><br />The album however, much like The Zombies themselves, suffered from a severe case of misplacement; still too ahead of its time which lead to a criminal overlooking of this work. Even after the book ending \\"Time Of The Season\\" became the anthem of 1969, the album and the band were long dissolved.<br /><br />Glancing at the cover one can only think of an acid trip vision, and likewise, an acid trip is a fitting metaphor for the flower power generation, socially and musically. One that had its peak high in Sgt. Pepper Lonely Hearts Club Band, was at its emotional comedown in Odessey & Oracle, and had its paranoid withdrawal symptoms in Forever Changes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have been waiting so long for this to come out for the kindle fire.It is finally here!!!! Minecraft is one of my favorite games in the world!!!! I am so happy!!!!!! I highly recommend this app.Thank you mojang!!!!!!!!!
B004UID2LC|1.0|idk about everybody else's kindle fires, but both mine and my sister's are not allowing us to view or download videos.<br /><br />whenever we try to view/download a video it says to check the connection, yet I am able to surf the net and even watch vids at youtube itself.<br /><br />not sure if the kindle fires are acting up or youtube is being a hard a**.
B005NFJAMG|5.0|Kurt Russell and the rest of the cast were at their best.<br />Good pacing and kept you on the chair.
B005FISBTO|1.0|I don't have to rant about how great Dexter Season 6 is, because all Dexterphiles know it's THE show. What I will rant about is the full two minutes of Showtime previews after the DVD loads: there is NOTHING you can do - stop, menu, etc. - to stop the previews of Showtime shows before the menu displays and allows you to select the first episode. I don't give a rat's furry big patootie about these shows: I want to get into the episode. Very crappy and disrespectful of Showtime towards the person who bought the DVD set.
0071766588|1.0|it took a few months to ship to my house.  I was very angry. I waited for a long long long time.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Let me start by saying that I don't normally read romance novels that contain graphic scenes.  Knowing this, I borrowed the book from the library to see what it was all about because I heard that through the sex is a good plot.  I have to say the book is just okay.  I don't find it offensive, but I'm not finding it exciting either and I don't really care for the characters.  My suggestion would be to borrow the book from the library.  If you like it-great and stick with it.  If not, move on.<br /><br />Oh, and I disagree with those that say there is NOTHING similar between this book and Twilight (and there are those of you out there).  I thought of Twilight very early on in the book.  The specifics are not the same but the basic plots are.<br /><br />Twilight: Girl, who doesn't think highly of herself and feels awkward, falls for a beautiful man that she feels is more beautiful than she is.  Man tries to warn her away claiming he is dangerous, yet he finds himself unable to stay away from her.<br /><br />50 Shades: Woman, who has two left feet and doesn't think highly of herself, falls in love with a beautiful man who she thinks is out of her league.  The man tries to warn her away saying he is dangerous, but finds her intriguing.<br /><br />You know what, on second thought there is nothing similar with these plots...never mind...I don't know what I was thinking. :-)  Happy reading!!
0307341577|5.0|I actually read this after Gone Girl.  I liked the writing but not necessarily the plot resolution in Gone Girl and wanted to see what else Ms. Flynn had to offer.  I was not disappointed! Whereas Gone Girl is about the darkness beneath beautiful--or at least seemingly happy--surfaces, Dark Places starts utterly dark but lets the beauty creep in.  Call me a traditionalist, but I like the positive character arc a bit better.<br /><br />Main character Libby Day is about as unlikeable as one can be in the beginning of the book, but I could not help but grow to love (and even sympathize?) with her as she found herself in the process of re-solving her family's brutal murder.  I was a kid in the 1980s and Flynn hit some of the less nostalgic elements of that era on the head: the dying farming industry, acid wash fashion, death metal, satanic paranoia, and the things kids turned to for thrills in the age of unplugged boredom. Add a layer of financial desperation (both past and present) for motivation and crime groupies for comic relief and you've got a really entertaining read.  If you liked Gone Girl but crave a book with a more satisfying ending, Dark Places is for you.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Very interesting information provided.  Obama makes some very bad decisions about what our troups should do in battle.  For a \\"Commander and Chief\\" he needs to obtain a second opinion before making decisions that are life and death to our soldiers.
B009CPEOC4|4.0|Very entertaining and would recommend to others. I liked it very much. Good content. Very inspiring. Katy has an amazing voice and determination to succeed.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Excellent resource.  Shocking and enlightening, I have been completely off wheat for 15 days at this point.<br />Have lost 7.5 lbs. and feel better than I have in years. Clothes already fit better, more energy, no back pain or joint stiffness which have both been problematic for years.
0374214913|4.0|I found this to be a really fun read and one that I didn't want to put down.  The book is a combination of literary fiction and mystery, focusing on the intersection of books with technology. Plenty of people have already written a summary of the plot, so I won't repeat that here, nor do I want to give anything away. The author does a great job in developing these characters - Kat and Mr. Penumbra in particular. I loved seeing Google through the eyes of Kat.  The author also does a good job of building suspense in the story; he develops scenes fully but always keeps the plot moving forward and the reader wanting to turn the next page.  The only thing that I didn't enjoy that much was the ending - not so much the substance, but the feeling that the ending was a bit rushed. That's a very small flaw in an otherwise great tale though.<br /><br />Recommended for just about anybody and I'll definitely be reading the author's next book.
B007FG9LIE|2.0|The ending was the best, the middle bogged  down ,lost me but all come togeather a very good book to read
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Steven King has always been a better writer than he's gotten credit for, and that's true in this book.<br /><br />A very interesting look at a historical event and the complexities of time travel. Probably could've been 10% shorter with some more aggressive editing, but it had good story lines and very good character development.
0345803485|2.0|So I fell onto the Fifty Shades of Grey bandwagon. This author's writing style is HORRIBLE!!!! I felt like I was reading a teenager's diary. Every other phrase was \\"I blushed; the color flushed from my face; Don't bite your lip Anastasia\\". I love to read, but it was extremely hard for me to finish this book, but I hung in there just to see what happened with these characters, plus I bought the trilogy for the kindle. If I didn't buy the trilogy, I would not have finished this crap. I have been told, it gets better and I just started book 2, which so far is a little better.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved its twists and turns and unpredictable ending.  Well written. Husband also liked it. Stayed up past my bed time to see how it ended.
B000BF0D9M|5.0|This two-CD Set of the most scintillating, spendorus music I've ever heard is a dream come true. I can't stop listening to them.
0307744434|1.0|The first few pages had me gripped.... the language, the characters and the plot. That was extremely short lived.<br /><br />The characters were all very boring and I can honestly say that NOTHING happened in this book. I kept reading thinking, \\"Something big is going to happen next, I just know it.\\"  Well, nothing happened. Not even at the ending.<br /><br />It's a book of buildup..... builds you up, gets you excited.... but nothing comes of it. Time after time the same thing.... just buildup.  Every storyline in this book seemed to die in the middle. Maybe this author is just not a good finisher.<br /><br />If you don't have it, don't buy it. Check it out at your local library instead.<br /><br />If you're currently reading it and your motivation for continuing to read it is because you assume 'something big is going to happen,\\" well, that something never does. Put it down and move on with your life.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It's a good story. It won't blow your mind but it's quite recommended. It's serious when it has to be and funny in some parts. An enjoyable read.
0345803485|3.0|On one hand, I take my hat off to Ms James for cashing in with her McDonalds version of literature. Sure, she is taking squillions to the bank (and can probably buy her own billionaire now) but it has all the nutritional value of a Quarter Pounder.<br /><br />I think a lot of people bought the book based on the hype. I'm not sure whether that makes Ms James brilliant (as the writer) or her publicist/publisher brilliant for marketing crap and passing it off as Peregrine Truffles.<br /><br />I have yet to find any real fan of her work - many who have read it but very, very few who thought it brilliant, and even those who enjoyed the underlying and eternal romance tones of girl fixes broken man and they ride off into the sunset together, they all comment on the bad writing.<br /><br />Still, she has done one thing for author's like myself. She's made it cool to read sexy novels again. For that, I will forever be grateful.<br /><br />Author of The William S Club<br />[...]
B004HW7JH4|1.0|I bought seasons 1 - 4 but the disk wont play in my dvd palyer, I know its not the player as every thing else works in it. the dvds do however work in the computer, I am going crazy. this is very frustrating.
B0098R6M1M|1.0|When I watched the trailer I thought this would be a funny, possibly uplifting movie. What a bummer! I wouldn't waste my time.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I have found this book to be one that you cannot lay down until you have finished.  I have all three of the books:<br />The Girl with the Dragon Tatto & The Girl Who Played with Fire & am now reading The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest  by Stieg Larsson.  Wat a shame that he has passed away.  I rate all three of these books to be 5*s. Sue Stimson<br />All 3 of these books were purchased from Amazon.Com & were on my Kindel I also purchased from Amazon.com
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Fun, entertaining, easy to learn and play.  Good for both kids & adults.  Levels get progressively more difficult.  Love the ad-free version, no annoying pop-ups.  Becomes addictive, trying to get all 3 stars or find the golden egg, and can be a time-suck if you don't watch out!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I bought this fan to replace it with my stock AMD FX-6200 fan.<br /><br />Stock fan was running around 2700 RPM (at the lowest level) and this one runs around 1000 RPM, and yet my CPU temperature was decreased around 15 degrees (before at some workload it was around 53 C and now with the same workload it runs at about 39 C). The noise is much less now!<br /><br />The installation is fairly easy, although at first it looked a bit confusing (comment this review if you have a question regarding installing it on an AM3 processor).<br /><br />I'm totally satisfied and wished I bought it sooner... couldn't expect more from a fan with a price less than $25!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I use this app every night to put my riddled to sleep. and I use it to relax as well.

B008Y1RTUG|3.0|Let's begin with the highlights -<br />Chris Hemsworth is a good actor and he does a great job with what he was given. He is able to do humor, drama, and he even brought a tear to my eye at one point.<br /><br />The cinematography is amazing - it was so good so as to make Kristen Stewart seem like she was doing a good job acting (at times).<br /><br />The lowlights - I really wanted Kristen Stewart to convince me that despite her lethargic Twilight acting, she is amazing. Alas, she really is not. She and Hemsworth are supposed to have flames shooting between them (or at least sparks), this should have been easy since - Uh, hello it is Chris Hemsworth we're talking about here - instead she looked at him like one might look at a brother. She just did not live up to the previews or the script.<br /><br />As for Charlzie Theron, she cannot do a British accent to save her life and she came across as a deranged psychopath rather than a scary stepmother type. But then again that may have been what she was going for.<br /><br />Overall worth the watch because despite the issues that I, and other reviewers, have indicated, up until the end it's a good movie. Actually if you stop the movie just as Stewart eats the apple you'll have seen all that's worth seeing, well except for Hemsworth doing a nice solo act in which he brought a tear to my eye.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Its a great read I love love it .i can read it over and over agin .after readin it I cudtn wait to read fifty shades darker

B004J4WLB4|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I would compare the author's writing style to Anita Shreve. The mood is somber but neither depressing nor dull. This story is filled with emotion in a young woman's life and contains flashbacks to her childhood (also filled with emotion).
B001DF68MA|4.0|From the start... I have to say I was shocked at how small the chair appeared as I pulled it out of the box. My first thought was this surely has to be for a new born! However I was presently surprised that my 15 month old daughter who is rather tall for her age fitted into it really well. Now for the road test!<br /><br />From the moment the bike started moving down the driveway she had a smile from ear to ear followed closely by a very quiet yet deep, giggle of sheer joy.<br /><br />Pro's - being able to talk to her and point things out (birds, dogs, boats and the like) andf just share the expereice. I could give her a little one arm hug, kiss on the cheek or straighten her helmet whilst we were still on the go and the sense that if something did happen to go wrong; I was in the best possible position to protect her. The centre cushion \\"thing\\" came in handy during our last ride when the sleep fairies came for a visit as Holly was able to lay her head on the side and just watch the world go by.<br /><br />Con's - although Holly is tall, her knees were still lower than her hips when seated but the leg supports could be an inch or two longer, they do adjust up and down but an inch or so more would be great.<br /><br />Asking AUD $199.00 in Australia but for some reason only USD $65.00 on Amazon!<br /><br />Should you buy this - YES, because your child will love the one on one experience!
B000NQRE1E|3.0|Great transfer, great audio, I personally don't care about \\"extras\\" that much however...there are extremely irritating pop-up chapter markers that pop up at the start of every chapter while viewing, and there are 65 chapters.  I could possibly live with this if the pop-ups did not appear in the middle of the picture but even then, I can not fathom why someone would go to all the bother of creating a film like this and essentially destroy it with a cheap, gimmicky \\"feature\\" like a pop-up add for every chapter times 65 chapters. I've never seen something so dumb done on such an otherwise excellent blu-ray before. Is there a pop-up blocker for this kinda thing?  Everything else is great, but be advised: there are annoying pop-ups that repeat 65 times on this blu-ray release.
B008BIN9EW|4.0|I found myself playing and draining my battery for days after downoading this game.  This game is challenging and tons of fun.
034580404X|5.0|Wow is what I have to say for these books.  I wish \\"real\\" sex could be this hot. I think every women out there should read them.
B0053O89JM|5.0|Season Eight as with all Seasons of House M.D will not disappoint....the ending will shock you or maybe not if you know House as well as I do , could not imagine not having all eight seasons in my video collection ....loved this television show and hated to see it end...like losing old friends
B0083SBJXS|1.0|Why oh Why do they keep releasing movies shot in 185.1 in the 178.1 aspect ratio it's wrong stop it release the movie the same as it was filmed, get over the black bars.............
B007SSEBCU|2.0|This movie should never have been released while she was still living. It made her look crazy and I dont blame her or her kids for not wanting to ever see it.
B003CW67TQ|4.0|Nesbo continues to make you guess \\"whodunnit\\". He has really created a lovehim/hatehim character in Harry Hole. Certainly as entertaining as Stig Larsen.
B000V39KDO|1.0|This movie is more than disappointing: It dishonors the legend of the 300 Spartans.<br /><br />The production is more for adolescents than adults.<br /><br />And, no, Spartans did not throw babies from a cliff, for whatever reason.  Archaeologists have excavated in Sparta for a long while and have never found a baby's skeleton.<br /><br />Google on these words for more truth: sparta reconsidered
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a great game its like playing the real thing in every traveling store that we all go to.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I've enjoyed Ken Follett's work for many years.  I was pleased to see that he planned to write a trilogy about the 20th century, as history is a favorite subject of mine, but I found this installment to be TOO epic.  Also not well balanced and very rushed at the end...  I like historical fiction in which fictional characters caught up in real historical events are the reason for the story.  With this novel, Ken Follett seemed more interested in historical events.<br /><br />\\"In 1946 so and so had a son, and then they had their second child in 1948, and by 1949 their third was on the way.  Then the Soviets detonated their bomb, the end.\\"<br /><br />Skipping a year here and there made for an awkward read.  All that said, I'll still read part three.
0307592731|4.0|I would have given this 5 stars had it not been for a scene involving a horse I really didn't like. Wild is not what it appears to be. I thought it would be a book predominately about hiking the Pacific Trail . . . it was, but then again it wasn't. The writing is flawless. Cheryl is able to write about feelings and emotions in such a way that I totally get her. EXCEPT that I didn't like her for most of the first half.<br />She came from a really f_ed up family, with a bohemian-ish Mom who wasn't exactly there, but was. In that fall out of that parental rearing Cheryl, whose last name has an interesting origin, grapples with her demons, and she has lots of them.<br />Her mother dies, leaving her a float in the river of live and Cheryl goes about trying to survive without her in the worst, most self destructive manner.<br />An odd rescuer comes in the form of a challenge she gives herself, which is to do the Pacific Coast Trail,  a hike that spans Mexico to Canada.<br />Her hike is actually just a backdrop to the internal physco-therapy she perpetuates upon herself. She is ill-equipped for the hike, as evidenced by dawning on a hundred pound monster of a backpack, she calls 'The Monster', but it is her sloppy innocence that finally won me over and had me rooting for her to finish the hike, but more than that, rooting for her to make peace with herself regarding her feelings toward and about her Mom.<br />It's a good read, one I'm sure most of you will enjoy
B0090P98Z4|4.0|fun game so far - graphics are good - music track is rousing - movement wheel is hit and miss and a little annoying but otherwise would recommend game.
