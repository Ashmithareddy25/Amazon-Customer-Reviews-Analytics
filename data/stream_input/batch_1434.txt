B004EPZ084|4.0|This movie scores points for originality and the clever use of crude humor. For example, how hilariously disconcerting and squirm-inducing is it to hear Jennifer Aniston, whom we came to know and love as the sweet Rachel on \\"Friends,\\" tell her befuddled male underling exactly what she wants to do with him, grab his crotch, and behave like the horniest cougar on the Serengeti? VERY. Aniston plays one of the titular \\"Horrible Bosses,\\" and her storyline masterfully turns the whole stereotypical sexual harassment scenario on its head. Colin Farrell (near unrecognizable a la Tom Cruise in \\"Tropic Thunder\\") plays another horrible boss, although he doesn't get nearly enough screen time. And Kevin Spacey, who never seems to do a bad job in anything, is the quintessential boss-from-hell. The high concept here is that Charlie Day, Jason Bateman, and Jason Sudeikis--as the unjustly abused underlings--will kill each other's bosses in a comically bizarre take on Hitchcock's \\"Strangers on a Train.\\" They enlist the help of &lt;colorful moniker> Jones (Jamie Foxx) as their \\"kill mentor\\" and hijinks inevitably ensue. Funny enough, and definitely good for more than a few laughs. Don't miss the gag reel at the end of the movie.
1451627289|5.0|11/22/63 is a really enjoyable book, and this is an understatement.  For those like me, too squeamish for some horror stories, this is maybe the best Stephen King novel EVER.  Wonderful character development, engaging/gratifying plot, and full of the cultural observations that make me love Stephen King.  I read it while simultaneously reading his part memoire, part instruction book, On Writing, and it made it just that much more fun to read this novel.  I also think he may have created a new religion here.  Count me among the true believers.

0143036742|2.0|This is the story of two estranged daughters who must band together when their elderly father suddenly decides to marry a Ukranian gold digger some fifty years his junior.<br /><br />This book pulled me in immediately.  Loved the quirky title, loved the beginning.  Thoroughly enjoyed the first few chapters.  But gradually, I lost interest.  Such an unpleasant group of people - nobody to care about.  The same conversations or jokes repeated over and over.  So many lists: what was growing in the garden, lying on the floor.  It became tedious.  The reviews applaud this as a comic novel, and there are parts that are amusing, but it's very much black humor rather than the laugh out loud and read-excerpts-aloud-to-your-husband kind.<br /><br />I know this book has been extremely popular and nominated for numerous awards which puts me very much in the minority but I just didn't get it.
B002N14GPE|4.0|I would have given this film a 5, if it were billed as a dark comedy. I watched it because it was listed as a thriller, and it does satisfy in that regard. This is, however, one of those typical movies for which you have to absolutely let go of reality in order to survive watching it without having a nervous breakdown from yelling at the screen! This was the quickest \\"adoption\\" I have ever seen. The home-life was rather cliched. And wow - talk about the world's most nauseating parents. But these are the elements that make it funny. That's the only way to deal with movies like this. Don't not treat them as dramas. Think of them as comedies and have fun.<br /><br />PS: The closing credits are very artistic.

0345803485|1.0|I wanted to find out what all the excitement was about. So, I ordered this book without reading the reviews.  Needless, to say I will NOT be ordering the other two books in this \\"series\\". If they were ever to make a movie from this book you would find it behind the curtain in the adult bookstores.  It is thinly disguised porn.  Pure and simple. I am used to a higher class of writing; books with substance and plot and not something that could have been written by a pubescent adolescent.<br />I read the first couple chapters hoping it would get better and when it didn't I started skipping pages at a time and reading only a sentence or two making sure I wasn't missing something.  I wasn't.  I am sorry I paid so much for this book instead of waiting for the 50 people in front of me that had reserved the book at the library.  I promised to pass it to my daughter but I think I will just throw it away.<br />If I could give it less than ONE star I would.  This is like a soap opera in words.  If this is your level of entertainment you will LOVE this book.<br />This author has one hell of a publicist for all the hype it is getting.
0307956350|3.0|A lot of people really liked this novel; it even turned up in The Approval Matrix of New York magazine. And it does have several things to recommend it.<br /><br />For starters, the reader is drawn into the plot from the first page, when the heroine Kate meets a strange yet familiar woman on a Paris street. From there author Chris Pavone takes us back a few years to Washington, DC, to a domestic scene where Katherine is listening to her husband Dexter proposing a move to Luxembourg. Although Katherine, a stay at home mom who once had some sort of government job, is at first perplexed by Dexter's proposal, she eventually comes to think of the move as an adventure. And an adventure she does have.<br /><br />There are lots of plot twists and secrets, some that are easily anticipated and others that come out of the blue. In the interest of avoiding spoilers, I will not say more. The point is that over the course of the novel characters come and go, and some return, although in different guise. The action picks up pace, slows down, builds suspense. This novel seems to have all of the making of really great entertainment.<br /><br />Somehow, though, by the time I got to the final pages and the mysteries were explained, the revelations were a let down and the solution was inelegant. The various pieces of the puzzle, so artfully presented throughout the story, just didn't fit together well enough for me to feel satisfied with the overall result. Perhaps Pavone is just too good at building suspense and less adept at resolving it in a fully believable conclusion.
B003F5NSTW|2.0|While you would never expect this story to be easy to read, it feels like it was written with a thesaurus on hand. It was difficult not just in content, but in form. Why use 2 syllables when you can use 4?
B006VRZ5YM|2.0|What's your number was boring, vulgar, and predictable, all the worst elements of a chick flick. Like many chick flicks, a girl worries about finding true love, encounters ex lovers, and ends up marrying the guy right in front of her nose. The jokes weren't particularly funny, mostly just vulgar. I'd recommend passing on this one.
0345803485|5.0|I just finished the series and way to go E.L. James!  I won't go into detail about the characters or the story line because every one knows by now.  All I can say it that is was a fantastic read!  I love every page and have recommended this to all my friends!
1469984202|5.0|This is the first sci fi book I've picked up in years; my usual fare is classic literature. I was looking for something different, and thought I'd try this out. Wow! I couldn't get the captivating story and terrific characters out of my mind! I devoured the whole series over a long weekend, and wanted more. Highly recommended - this is a great read!
B004Q7DQLS|4.0|Okay, what can I say. I love non-human men. This was a fun read.<br /><br />\\"Half-human and half-wyr, Pia Giovanni spent her life keeping a low profile among the wyrkind and avoiding the continuing conflict between them and their dark Fae enemies. But after being blackmailed into stealing a coin from the hoard of a dragon, Pia finds herself targeted by one of the most powerful-and passionate-of the Elder races.\\"<br /><br />I also have a weakness for dragons. So I may be a tad biased, but I enjoyed this one and will be looking into the next in the series. I didn't click with Pia, the herione at first, but she grew on me as I read on.<br /><br />Relationship-wise, I'd like to see a little more emotional build up and a little less insta-lust.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this book and (suck at reviewing!)

B000CRQX34|5.0|We've been searching for the directors' (terry Jones and Terry Gillian) voice-over since we heard it once on the Comedy Channel.  This is excellent--has what we were looking for plus a writers' voice-over and a ton of extra features.  Some (the locations) were only so-so, but OK, a taste of \\"Spam-a-lot\\" of course the movie itself so a real keeper.  Buy it! watch its features late at night when you're stoned!

B007IXWL2C|5.0|After reading Book 1 and 2 I couldn't wait to dive into Book 3!! Well, it lived up to everything I hoped it would be! A perfect way to end the story of the characters I was so wrapped up with. A wonderful trilogy! Simply stunning, well written and a thrill to read. Would definitely recommend all three books! #2 was my fav! #3 was next :-)
B005FITIF0|2.0|This is a ridiculous movie. The only positive fact is to show the terribles problems in that country.

Money to the wronh pockets!<br />Thanks \\"god\\" the movie is over! And the Blu-ray here in Brasil is 1.85:1 and the video quality is BAD! What a shame!

B003Y5H5F6|2.0|Well if you like Alice from (Resident Evil and Ultraviolet ) you will be happy with this movie. I like Milla jovovich's characters for what they started off as. But for Selene and the Underworld trilogy to have such a deep meaning and plot development? This 4 installment comes off as somewhat of a shocker to me. The visuals were still decent but the execution was lousy and rushed. The story was abysmal and the acting was just ok not serious.<br /><br />Everything was just so fast that is just seemed rushed and not very well planned. The lycans looked horribly and I mean horribly designed and CGI'ed. I am really curious as to why this one had a higher budget than the previous three. The 3rd installment \\"Rise of the Lycans\\" was a revelation to this . I guess if you are one of those people that had a hard time following a deep story you'll love this. But if not then you will probably be horribly disappointed. There was very little character development here so I don't think you will care about anyone. She was good in it for what she had to work with and play with.<br /><br />The only positives i can say about this over the 1st two installments. Is that she was finally a real vampire and a merciless killer. And the gore aspect was fantastic which wasn't in the previous two films. To see Selene kill humans with lack of empathy and suck there blood was just sexy. Other than that this movie doesn't offer anything above the 1st two. And to say that it hasn't progressed Technology over the 1st is pretty bad. I think \\"Evolution\\" and \\"Rise\\" looked way better than this one and that's putting it nicely. I really hope Patrick and Danny Mcbride jumps on board next time to save the franchise. I think if this continues this will be no more than a straight to video affair.
B001EQ5ZJK|4.0|In The Biology of Belief Dr. Lipton uses hard, cutting-edge science to explain things that science never has before, such as what the mind is and how it affects the body, how modern medicine does not treat the root causes of medical conditions, a scientific hypothesis to explain the existence of the spiritual world and how we are not leading genetically predetermined lives but are the masters of our own destiny.<br /><br />The author goes deep enough into the science of cellular biology to explain our true nature as human beings - body, mind and spirit - but explains it in simple enough terms for a non-scientific audience.<br /><br />The book creates a new awareness of how we as human beings form part of the universe and the effects of our thoughts and actions on the health of our body and mind.  Even for those who may be skeptical about the spiritual subjects, the science in itself is fascinating enough to make this a very worthwhile read.  For those who are open-minded enough Dr. Lipton's ideas may be life-changing.
B007M6P01O|5.0|This is a great series and can't wait for more. It is worth the download and your time. When season 3 hits, it is going to be epic. Everything is now in place for major changes.
B006WT2TZC|2.0|I've been a Scorpions fan since \\"Rock You Like A Hurricane\\" first came out back in the 80's, and though bittersweet I was content with Sting In The Tail as their swansong.  Comeblack reeks of a record label squeezing out one last album from a band, and it should never have been done in my opinion.  This will now be the last studio recording from one of the truly great hard rock bands to ever record music and tour.<br /><br />\\"So what's so bad about Comeblack?\\" you may ask.  It is an album of covers, but it gives an unfortunate and odd twist to the concept.  Half of the songs that the Scorpions cover are their own while the other half is a fairly random collection of musical flotsam and jetsam.<br /><br />There are common themes across the album.  First the songs are all overproduced.  Then there is the stiff and stilted vocal delivery from Klaus Meine.  He just seemed uninterested in making this CD to me.  Next you have messing with the Scorpions' classics.  I wish they had left these alone and stuck to a pure cover album.  The introduction of the talkbox turns \\"The Zoo\\" into a \\"Living On A Prayer\\" wanna be.  On \\"Wind Of Change\\", the guitars are even bluesier.  The first thing I thought of when I heard this was Pearl Jam's \\"Yellow Ledbetter\\".  Then there are the true covers.  These ranged from unmemorable to bad.  Some songs just aren't meant for the rock anthem treatment, and \\"Tainted Love\\" is one of them.  I think that Soft Cell did a fine job with this song, and it should have been left at that.  However the one that will probably raise the most eyebrows (especially among Stones fans) is \\"Ruby Tuesday\\".  If you haven't heard it yet, don't.<br /><br />Oh, Scorpions, why did you do this?  They broke two promises.  First, Sting In The Tail was supposed to be their grand finale.  Then at the end of Sting In The Tail they closed with \\"The Best Is Yet To Come\\".  While that is still possible, we can definitely say that this isn't it.  I would have had a hard time with average, but Comeblack doesn't even hit that bar.verage, but Comeblack doesn't even hit that bar.

I read it to escape from my day and just be entertained. Do I really need more than that in a book? Sometimes yes, but not today. Some people will hate it, some will secretly enjoy it and then there is me. Yeah, I liked it. If you are afraid of wasting money on this, ask a friend. I'm sure they have a copy to lend you. ;-)

B005QI4TP8|5.0|Every few years, a record comes out that is simply filled with *only* good songs. And it doesn't matter whether you like Hip-Hop, Punk, R&B, Jazz, Heavy Metal, Pop, Glee Covers, and everything else in between, because this CD is so good that you will enjoy listening to at least parts of it. It has good melodies, deep lyrics, virtually everything and anything you could want from one album.<br /><br />This is that record.<br /><br />\\"Ceremonials\\" by Florence + the Machine is the sophomore-slump-defying work by the welsh band, released in 2011. I honestly cannot reccomend this enough. Each and every song is absolutely amazing in its own right, deserving and worthy of multiple listens, well-provoked thought, and even a few music video searches here and there.<br /><br />Florence + the Machine is one of those rare bands that really has the whole package.<br /><br />I'll get to some individual tracks in a second, but, overall the sound of the band is a modern rock archetype, with a few twists. The first is the lead singer Florence, the red headed muse who literally has the voice of an angel. And she shows it off on this album with many vocal acrobatics and vowel holds. The next twist is the instruments that the band uses. You have the standard guitars, drums, backup vocals, keyboards, etc. But then you have harps, organs, maybe a violin here and there, bongo drums.<br /><br />It is a melding of the old and the new. And the final product is mystifying.<br /><br />The CD starts of strong with \\" Only if for a Night\\" (lyrics in my title), which is ultra-classy. Of course, right afterword is \\"Shake it Out\\" the first single off the record. Purely mystifying. Then there is \\"What the Water Gave Me\\", also powerful.<br /><br />THEN, the mood starts to change a bit. (Bum-Bum-Bummmm)<br /><br />\\"Never Let Me Go\\" is a strong track, but it is followed by, in my opinion, two of the weakest songs on the album: \\"Breaking Down\\" and \\"Lover to Lover.\\" Don't get me wrong, both are fantastic, just not my cup of tea. (Although I occasionally still listen to Lover to Lover.)<br /><br />Things instantly pick back up with \\"No Light, No Light\\" which is perhaps my favorite track on the CD, maybe even in the bands collective work. Organ, HArp, Drums, Guitars, I love it all.<br /><br />Then, unfortunately, you get *the* weakest track of the album \\"Seven Devils.\\" Among such happy songs, or at least sad songs with happy figurative language, Seven Devils just strikes me as cold, slow, and depressing. But it's still good for a few listens. That's how good this band is!<br /><br />\\"Heartlines\\" and \\"Spectrum\\" are next, which actually both tie for my second favorite song. They are both super-upbeat, ultra-realistic, and just masterful in execution. I listen to Heartlines while driving home, late at night, always with a huge smile on my face.<br /><br />Finally, you get \\"All This and Heaven Too\\" and \\"Leave my Body\\", more of the same, but still super strong.<br /><br />And that's a prevailing theme, a lot of the songs on here have the same thematic sound, but they are all different enough that they blend together and symphonize with each other, without sounding repetitive.<br /><br />Then there are the Bonus Tracks, which, to be honest, are kind of hit or miss. But all still decent enough to warrant a buy if you're interested.<br /><br />\\"Remain Nameless\\" is okay, and \\"Bedroom Hymns\\" is only alright. The Demo version of \\"What the Water Gave Me\\" is worth a listen, also, because it's interesting to see how the band evolved and developed. The best bonus track, in my opinion, is \\"Strangeness and Charm\\", which I wish made it onto the complete album *instead* of \\"Seven Devils\\", but that's just me. Both are outstanding songs.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you're still usnure about buying this album, download \\"Shake it Out.\\" If you like it, check out \\"No Light, No Light\\", \\" Spectrum\\", and \\"Heartlines\\". At that point, if you like what you hear, buy it. Share it with friends. Listen to it in the car. You will not regret it.<br /><br />TOP TRACKS:<br />1. No Light, No Light<br />2.

1400052181|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot is a very unique book. It tells the true story of the poor, African American woman named Henrietta Lacks who allowed for some of the biggest advances in Science in recent memory. Then, it continues to chronicle the hardships the family has since gone through, including personal interviews with the author herself.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, and it totally reads like a novel.<br /><br />Ms. Skloot writes in such powerful, poingant prose that does something I haven't seen since the likes of Truman Capote ([[ASIN:0375507906 In Cold Blood]]) or Harper Lee ([[ASIN:0061743526 To Kill a Mockingbird: 50th Anniversary Edition]] ... did I really have to tell you that one?), who both pioneered a genre they called \\"creative non-fiction.\\" In my opinion, this book is a clear descendant of that mindset, and the overall effect is beautiful.<br /><br />The book is divided into four parts, which, basically are: Henrietta's life, The Scientists who dealt with her, Rebecca Skloot's mission, and Skloot's work with the family. Then there is a conclusion that wraps things up nicely.<br /><br />What you read in this book will enrage you, as all great books do, but what you should know going into this is: proceeds from the book are going to help the Lacks family.<br /><br />See, writing a review for a non-fiction book is hard, especially a good one, because there aren't any dry parts I can complain about or plot lines I could discuss. Although this book has a plot, I would feel terrible to spoil anything at all for anyone. So I'm not going to.<br /><br />Just let me say that the story in this book almost made me cry. Oh, yes. Did I mention I'm 17 years old and a guy? And it almost moved me to tears. I cannot stress how powerful this book is. Go, read it. Introduce it to your book club. Gain some knowledge of the world around you.<br /><br />And embark on the journey that Skloot will lead for you.

I can hardly wait until the rest of the trilogy is delivered to read more. (What's up with the long delay Amazon??) It seems to me to be a love story and I remember those familiar feelings....almost makes me want to get back out there again and see if I can capture it again. :)
0345803485|1.0|I bought this book because there seemed to be so much hype surrounding it. I very rarely quit a book, but I quit this one on page 143 when Christian's mother walks in. Really? The man keeps a torture chamber in his apartment, and his mother can just walk in at any time? Not to mention, he introduces Ana to his mother, after explaining that he doesn't want a romantic relationship with her? Everything about this book is so unbelievable it's ridiculous. I would like an explanation as to how this book became published. Ana is so boring, and frankly stupid, its painful (ha ha, pain. get it?). She's willing to be tied up and tortured but doesn't understand how a man is going to fit inside her \\"down there\\"? she can't use a term other than \\"down there\\" for \\"down there\\"? crap. and now im blushing. double crap. This book is so poorly written it's craptastic. Ms. STEELE? Mr. GREY? with gray eyes? COME ON!
B00065MDRW|5.0|This is one of the ten best albums ever created. This is the start of Progressive Rock. These are the pioneers, the pilgrims. The genius of this album is that Fripp, McDonald, Giles, and Lake take you on a visual journey of the mind. This is the root for all that came after. Don't miss the beauty of the music, the poignant lyrics, the fusion of rock, orchestration, and a bit of psychedelic; combined with the incredible voice of Greg Lake (who would shortly after found Emerson, Lake and Palmer)<br /><br />The classic \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\", The beautiful \\"I Talk to The Wind\\", The epic ballad \\"Epitath\\", and the sensitive \\"Moonchild\\" must be heard again and again.<br /><br />Along with Pet Sounds, Odessy and Oracle, Led Zeppelin IV, Tommy, Yes Songs, Welcome Back My Friends to The Show that Never Ends, should be all a part of your music library.......

B003XMAD3G|5.0|I bought this RAM to upgrade my new QNAP 659 PRO II NAS from 1GB to 3GB RAM.  At less then $20, it was a no brainer.  Installation was a snap, and it works great!  Thanks!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|really entertaining and easy to earn money and acorns which is nice. also who can beat free? everyone needs to get this app!
0345803485|5.0|I so enjoyed this series of books. It reminded me of 9 1/2 weeks but with a happy ending.  Yes the sex is a constant throughout the book but what kept me so engrossed was the love story. Christian and Anastasia both sacrificed a lots for each other and it paid off for them in the end.
B007PVHAN2|5.0|Much Love and Blessing to the Marley family for authorizing this very detailed account of his Majesty's son and messenger - Robert Nesta Marley!  The interviews from close family members and friends really set this documentary apart from other works about the great Bob Marley.  This documentary will help educate generations upon generations to come that Bob Marley was on a mission to spread Jah's Love for all mankind.  One Love to Kevin MacDonald and his team for creating a great piece of art. - JAH Bless
B006LRUVUA|3.0|I wanted an app to stream my videos from my Pc to my kindle. while this app gave me remote access to my pc and I could find the video files, no matter what program I used to play them, the videos would not appear on the kindle and there was no sound either. the videos did play just fine on the pc but not on the kindle no matter what I tried.  i also could not playback mp3 files either on the kindle because of no sound. if you want to do other things remotely on your kindle like use a spreadsheet or read documents this app is fine. but if you want to stream videos try another app.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book kept me wanting more. I literally could not put it down.<br />the plot was beyond interesting with complex characters.<br />The \\"love\\" scenes were extremely graphic, but it didn't find them to be in anyway over bearing.<br />over all it was a great book.<br />Ive read the rest of the series as well and the story of Ana and Christian only gets better!
B001B93H0O|5.0|The product received was exceptional. I am really enjoying this fitness series.The package wasn't even opened and was better than expected!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its the best game in the world and it make it feel like u taking care of those animals at ur very own house that's fun and the squirell with acorn is the funniest and I luv the mud bath and Diego is one cuteittle animal of the ice age although tht sloth id too idk nut ..,...............hope u like the game
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is good I really like; not totally sold on this spicific game yet. much better them most and the best one of its kind!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is awesome. This game is well worth the download. Simply awesome and fun, starring your favorite characters from the movie!
1455508977|3.0|This was a nice weekend or \\"beach\\" read along the same lines as his previous book \\"The Rescue\\".  It's a good book, but don't expect any revelations here. The by-the-numbers formula doesn't stray too far into any one emotion or potentially tense situation.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|amazing game, cant stop playing it lol I am in love with it plus graphics are great.. its so fun
B0063IH60K|4.0|Its a nice classic game to have on the go! I enjoy it when ever I have a moment to play. Anyone can enjoy this and I will keep it on my Kindle for a good while.
B007VGXS8M|4.0|Waldo kind of defined the hidden object genre in paper form. This game does a decent job bringing the book to touch-screen, but it could really use zoom in/out and ability to hide on-screen widgets (they get in the way of seeing the picture on screen).
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun<br />this game is fun and is very addictive. some games are hard but I end up beating the game tho. my favorite game is the snake.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the book and it was great to be able to read it on my ereader.  Couldn't stop til I completed the book.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I do like this game but the glitches need to be fixed. Crazy times on the building is very frustrating. I would give it 5 stars but the glitches have to be fixed!!!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Excellent book and could not put my ereader down. I love ebooks especially the just released ebooks. A must read.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Suzanne out did herself I enjoyed the Hunger Games more than Percy Jackson and the Heroes of Olympus combined. Katniss was a very complex and fickle chatacter and that kept me riveted I finished the series in three days.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|if there possibly could be a game that was like epic war for touch screen this is it and I hope sommeday that epic war fouls be converted
B003U80I5G|5.0|Please,please, please.  Restore the best film adapatation of Bronte's immortal classic!!  I remember seeing this version of Jane Eyre when it first televised in 1971 and I thought it was the best version of the novel to date.  I still believe this more that 40 years later and others that followed.  New is not always better, but restoration is what is called for here.  Would someone in Hollywood please see to it that this film survives for others to enjoy?
145470246X|5.0|This book has the most beautiful designs I have ever seen. I haven't been able to put it down. The only problem is that I have now emptied my piggy bank, ordering new beads to make all of the gorgeous pieces I have marked from this book. They make my mouth water. Her Instructions seem very clear, however I have not made any yet(still waiting on bead orders).I can't wait to get started,Um,um.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|cute little game that most of older folks have played but much easier, Imo, could use some more difficult elements to make it more of a challenge.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|I like the cover but the stand on it could be more secure. It is not very heavy and not bulky, but the slot that you use for the stand is not sturdy.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I'd give it 5 stars if my energy didn't run out so fast. Also,  I am out of cash so I can't complete an objective. I think I will have to uninstall, which is a shame. The game is fun and it has good graphics.
B0055SWM08|5.0|it certainly was worth the download. kept me busy for several hours:-) :-)  I would recomend it. it has may levels to advance to, all in all a good play:-)<br /><br />definately 5 star.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Gives me the basic weather inform I want, without a bunch of extra flash. Only complaint is that there is no refresh button to get the most up to three minute forecast.
B004T4KQJS|4.0|Dr. Krauss is an outstanding scientist and he presents his Physics as you would expect. When presenting a spiritual comparison, however, I think he allows too much of his emotion to show through and instead of giving the same intellectual arguments to the spiritual, he tends to trivialize and minimize their points. As a reader I was left thinking Dr. Krauss feels science is somehow  being \\"threatened\\" by the possibility of a supreme being. It's still a worthwhile read, however...
B007SYWFRM|3.0|this is fun but on kindle fire you can go back to home page. So you have to be turning your divice on and off.
B0055SWM08|4.0|good game for a rainy afternoon, some of the puzzles are not easily solved . but are challenging enough to maintain interest. I like the game and am having a difficult time coming up with enough words to be able to submit this review.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Reeling from the collapse of an intimate relationship, Beck intentionally, and I think bravely, made a full album with not a single rollicking piece in it to break or artificially lighten the mood. A true artist, Beck finds dignity, triumph and majesty in the struggle with loss and isolation. \\"Sunday Sun,\\" \\"The Golden Age,\\" and especially the masterful channeling of Nick Drake in \\"Round the Bend\\" (imagine ND in the studio with the later Pink Floyd) brilliantly explore personal desolation without in any way becoming maudlin or morose. It's always gratifying when a great artist proves his or her greatness in creativity and honesty (\\"Guess I'm Doing Fine\\" and the astounding \\"Little One\\"), and not just cleverness in marketing.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is exactly what I was looking for. I can read everything an want for personal Bible Study.  I have been blessed by getting to use the reading plans. Youversion, keep on doing what you are doing. May the Word of the Lord go forth.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|cut the rope is really fun and cute. the monster or whatever it is is so adorable! the only reason i gave this app 4 stars is because it isnt as addictive as some other apps such as annoying orange and fruit ninja.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|Fun game but could use more features that don't require money or a social network to unlock.  I don't want my kids to be able to really buy items thru my account.
B00634GHJA|5.0|It works exactly as it said.  It was a no frills app but it helped me move my pictures from my Thunderbolt phone to my computer.<br /><br />Phone must be on wi-fi.  On phone I selected my pictures and the app issued me a random url address.  On computer I went to the given url and downloaded the zip file of pictures.  Took seconds and bam! the pictures were in the file I selected to download them to on my computer.<br /><br />I know there are many other ways to transfer photos and maybe some are better but this review is for this app only.  It did what it promised.  It was fast.  It was free.  Try it out.
B00634GHJA|5.0|It does exactly what it says it will do, and is pretty simple.  I think the strength is device to device transfer, which is very straightforward.  I happened to have bought the iOS version of this awhile back to try to do photo transfer between my iPad and my computer but hadn't played with it.  PC to device is just about as clean.<br /><br />You can transfer from computer (PC or Mac, it's web-based on a computer) to a device or from device to device. The computer and/or devices must be on the same WiFi network.  There's also a means for bluetooth transfer, though that of course doesn't apply to the Fire.<br /><br />Photos transferred to the Fire are placed in a folder called \\"PhotoTransfer\\" and are viewable through the Gallery app on the Fire.<br /><br />I think I'll actually use this a fair bit as I have photos on my iPad, my iPod Touch and very few on the Fire, but would like some on the Fire.
B00634GHJA|5.0|I transferred my pictures from phone to my kindle fire, but now I cannot figure out where my pictures are on the kindle fire. I tried the customer support and all I get is this app stopped working.<br /><br />1/4/12-Finally I figured out where my pictures were when I transferred them from my phone to the Kindle Fire. Conveniently, they go into an app already on the Kindle Fire called gallery. After I found the Gallery it has been smooth sailing.<br /><br />I now love this app!!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Best sync product I have encountered so far. I can sync all my notes and picture and view them from all my online devices&hellip;
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this game might be a little too addictive but I love that when I feel like things are slowing down a little the game gives me difficult challenges to overcome
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this game is incredibly addictive. I couldn't stop playing. I do wish there was more of an explaination of certain things; like fishing.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I made sure I read the book before I watched this.  The movie followed the book very well.  There were some minor changes, especially when Blomkvist & Salander find Harriet Vanger.  There were 2 rape scenes in the movie were tougher to watch on the screen that to read about mainly because when I was reading it, I had the advantage of applying my own filters in visualizing the text.  I'm currently reading \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire,\\" which I have found to be even better than Dragon Tattoo.  I am so looking forward to reading \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" and seeing the rest of the trilogy on the big screen.  I know that there's already a Swedish version of the trilogy on film that was done only a couple of years ago.  I have not watched those films yet, but they are on my must watch list.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a great  game and i love it. it is a great time waster. also its a great buy. it is free!!!!!!!!!
B004EPZ06G|3.0|Movie was okay.  It had some original funny moments but for the most part, retold some of the gags from the first movie in a different way.  I just hope Hangover 3 avoids this.
B005HSL626|3.0|this game is soooo fun.. but it always has a blackout!  when a blackout has occured... a video ad always pops up. then u have to close it.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love this app its fun and it has great graphics a few minor glitches need to be worked out though like cant connect to.other villages tells you to to update but still cant connect also have troubles getting friends to connect with me also in order to get out of game you have to go to stuff then options. but its still fun
B00634GHJA|2.0|I transferred files from my kindle fire to my phone once and since then I can't get it to work at all. I've followed all the troubleshooting tips with no luck. Great idea, terrible execution.
0439023521|3.0|The content of the book was awesome. The book seemed in good shape when I received it , but the pages started to fall out about half way thru.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible app it is so User friendly! It has so many different versions of the Holy Bible and is easy to switch between them. And best of all it reads out loud to you!! I highly recomemd this app!
B005IZLPKQ|2.0|first, i saw the trailer and i thought this would be an awesome movie, and maybe i expected too much, cause when i watched it, it was totally BORING. In general, i didn't enjoy to see this movie once more time like unusual.... come on marvel, you can do better than this ( thor, spider-man, iron man, hulk,.... 4 example )
0345803485|2.0|Definitely too much S&M.  I have never read about so many orgasms.  This ruined a good love story. Just not believable
B004T6IBNY|1.0|it wont download for me I hats it but I want it. its so stupid that I cant play it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|so i totally adored this book but the exact same concept is in the lucky one. dont get me wrong, theyre both great but he should have made them a bit different
B00753MBHA|5.0|Another Metal Masterpiece by Accept.These guys are on a roll.Long live Metal! What most people today call Metal is a joke.Thank you Maiden,Anvil and Accept for keeping the fire burning! I finally have a reason to rest Blood of Nations for at least a few weeks.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've played this several times and I've never encountered a bug.  Great way to pass time.  The hints aren't very helpful, but otherwise no complaints.
0345803485|1.0|I cannot finish this book. I am so dissapointed. There is zero depth of character. If I read the word \\"wow\\" in italics one more time, I'm going to go nuts. Why is this book so popular? We get it, he's good looking. Besides the sex scenes this book may have been better developed for a younger audience. The characters are not believeable or really even likeable. Pretty bummed over here...<br /><br />Addition to my first review-I finally finished this book because a friend told me I needed to get past chapter eight to really get into it. All that has made me do is feel that I have wasted a lot of time waiting for this book to surprise me and I had to change my star rating from two to one. This book is so unbelieveable and the sex scenes started to border on the comical. This chick has an orgasm at the drop of a hat.The repitition was ridiculous. I hated this story!!!!! If you can even call it that. Way too many lonely house wives have purchased this book. Way to put money in this horrible writers' pockets ladies! Way to go.
B0065NAKRO|5.0|I haven't played muggins's for many years!  This works wonderfully on my Kindle Fire. Kudos to the developer as this the best app I have found for plsying dominoes.
0062082353|5.0|This book was hard to put down. Fantastic read. What a great story about an unassuming hero. I am so happy he survived to chronicle the missions. Also felt his wife's input was important. We do not often hear that side.
B00004YRQA|5.0|It's kind of strange going back and writing a review for a piece of tech as antiquated and archaic as a memory card, but seeing how I recently purchased a PS2 of my own recently, I figured, why not? To be honest, there isn't much to say. This memory card holds 8 megabytes (a far cry from today's consoles, where 120 GIGABYTE hard-drives is quite common, and they're always growing), and it fulfills its purpose well. It's so strange to be using a system with an external, tiny memory card like this after becoming accustomed (and spoiled) by today's technological standards, but for what it's worth, it works well. The loading speed when loading files from this card is surprisingly quick, I like it quite a lot. The thing is, if you own a PS2, then you need this little piece of hardware in order to save any file, and that along makes it worth the purchase. It's also fun to own an \\"antique\\" from an interesting and transitory time in gaming history. Great stuff.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|love the game on my fire. it will be a wonderful game when they. get the bugs out. lots of fun.
0887306667|5.0|The proof of a good how-to book is that it is as true and good when you read it as it was when it was written--in this case 1993! \\"The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing\\" is such a book. It's almost 20 years old and still right on point. I've written a book and am learning how to market and sell it; the process has been to read every book I can locate on marketing. After reading maybe a dozen, mostly new contributions, I am delighted to find this little book says concisely more than any other I've yet read. I readjusted my own marketing strategy three times while reading it based on their explanation of a \\"law\\". What a great bit of information. If you are wanting to sell anything--anything--I strongly recommend this book. Thank you Al & Jack.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|Good movie with great a cast, it was fun to watch. I recommend you invest in a surround sound, to enjoy the full experience.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|way better than other build your own village games. my daughter loves it just as much as I do. she loves scrat
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|Well, let me tell you, if you dont own it already, you should, and it should definitely be on blu-ray. The quality is superior for a movie which is also superior and a great homage to the fan outcry regarding Firefly's untimely demise. The movie wraps up what would probably have been another two to three seasons worth of Firefly, but does so like a champ.<br />One great feature here is you get both blu-ray and DVD, so if you cant play blu-rays, you need not fear.<br />Somehow, i am feeling that anybody reading this has a high probability of being familiar with, if not an avid fan of the series, movie, and genre. So, i suppose i am most likely preaching to the choir, but on the off chance you dont know about this movie, watch it (but if you havent watched Firefly, you need to do so first. Everything will make a lot more sense then).
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games makes me excited. When I read the book, I'm always trembling with excitment. In the book, you don't know what's coming. In some books you know when somebody's going to die or win a game. In the Hunger Games you don't know what's going to happen because the author makes things crazy at times and simple at times. You never know which one it's going to be. That's why I couldn't put the book down!
B0055SWM08|4.0|Beating a level is usually easy, beating it in the minimum number of moves can be really hard. Good puzzle game!
0439023513|3.0|When I was done with book two I was happy to start Mockingjay. Then I started reading. I was waiting and waiting for the good part to start. It never really did. There were some parts that were great but not as good as book one and two.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|cool I like this game. it is a cool game. this game is cool. if you like cool games then you will like this.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This movie brings back so many beautiful memories and the 45th anniversary limited edition is wonderful.  The book of information on the stage musical, movie, actors and the Van Trapp family was very interesting.  My husband and I took our mothers to see this movie just before we were married in 1965, so it brings back some sweet memories. The little music box included in the package was broken in our first delivery which had to be returned and another set sent to us.  The sets are numbered so the two were widely apart in numbers.  Not of great concern to me, but might be to some.

B003E6K1VK|5.0|I wanted a good headphone amp for my Denon AH-D5000. At first I went for the NuForce uDac2 which I thought were good (but didn't have anything else to compare against).  I read some more good reviews about the Fiio E7 so I thought I'd give it a try as well.  And this time I could actually hear the difference.  The E7 sounds great and the build quality and features are excellent.  Much better value than the uDac2.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|only one good or two good games the rest just really suck or are just too easy if you want to waste your time this game is for you
0545265355|5.0|Already a household word, Katniss.  If you haven't read the book, you'd be lost wondering, \\"What the heck is that!\\"  As our world teems with violence, this could be our future.  The story by Suzanne Collins is extremely intoxicating.  Once you start you start reading you can't stop so purchasing this cost saving trio package is the way to go.  How I would love to be able to capture the feeling, the imagination and continuity of this story.  You think all the surprises have been revealed, but they continue until the last page.  Wonderful read for all.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|angry birds space is the best game ever I absolutely. love. it. if you looking for a really fun game here it is
B007SYWFRM|5.0|our family really likes to build our village together. as soon as someone puts the Kindle down someone else picks it up to play. very fun!
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I have used this for a few workouts so far, both for running and biking. Overall, I'm very impressed. I am especially impressed with the \\"virtual partner\\". It is a great tool to keep you motivated and on track! The only thing that I have a problem with is with the touch bezel. Like other reviewers have stated, if you are sweating, it is very difficult to make it work correctly. Otherwise, great product! I recommend it!
B00634GHJA|1.0|can't figure out how to delete the application. when I put the ip address in my web browser it doesn't bring anything up
B006ZZAMWK|1.0|Just another boy band with weak vocals and cheesy lyrics. Nowadays music is based on looks, not actual music. This isn't raising the bar, it's lowering it.
B0071QIN00|3.0|this game I super hard u could pass the first level but after that it just gets harder I'm still a level6and I cant pass it
0345803507|4.0|Clearly this is fiction.  I think you need to recognize that first and foremost when reading these books.  Most of what is going on is utterly fantastical and would not happen in real life.  But hey, I don't want to read about someone getting gas, carting kids around, doing laundry, going to work, typing up memos, getting into arguments with the neighbor, grocery shopping, people not wanting to sleep with their spouse, blah blah blah....<br /><br />I will say, I really enjoyed this book, notwithstanding all the repetition that has been going on for two books now.  But, if you've made it this far in the series, you have obviously either not noticed it (though I cannot imagine how this is possible), or gotten past it somehow like I have.<br /><br />Book three takes Christian and Ana into the challenges of living their everyday lives together.  Or rather Ana's challenges living with and dealing with Christian and his mountain of baggage and helping him gain some sense of normalcy in his behavior and life.<br /><br />A lot is explained in this book, and Christian makes impressive progress in becoming a \\"normal\\" person.  He is still controlling and demanding, but less so than he was.<br /><br />This book also has a bit more \\"story\\" to it, beyond the romance, sex, and can't-get-enough-of-each-otherness than the previous two books.<br /><br />SPOILER:<br /><br />I did love the way the author ended the book.  The fact that she went a couple years out to when C & A have a family gave closure to the story, and gave a glimpse of the future they have together and I love that at the very end, she retold the beginning of the story from Christian's perspective.  Just that section alone is worth reading book 3, because it shows not only just how far he has come, but WHERE he has come from.  A friend had told me that after finishing book 3 she was going to read them again, and I thought she was crazy! But, the ending of book 3 did make me re-read the beginning of book 1 again.  The ability to read the same events from both C & A's perspectives was a bonus, imo.  Boy was Christian F'd up!!! That is all I can say about that.  He came a long way! I'd like to have seen more of that, more of his perspective.<br /><br />The book series might have been vastly improved had the author told the story from both of their perspectives the whole way through.<br /><br />I liked this series, it was easy reading compared to what I normally read, but there was SOOO much more the author could have done to improve these books.ability to read the same events from both C & A's perspectives was a bonus, imo.

0439023521|4.0|Overall, I'd give this book 4 stars- because I know it was written for young adults, not full-fledged adults.  But if I were reviewing this as an adult, which I am, I'd give this book only 3 stars despite all the hype.  Here's the scoop:  the writing is simple and definitely not brilliant (designed for a younger audience, I know...)  and I felt that the main character Katniss lacks depth.  While deeply committed to saving her family, she is somewhat robotic and thus only barely interesting.  I kept waiting for more personality to unfold, but alas, it did not.  The story itself however, IS engaging.  Pretty creepy, too, because the 'survivor' contestants, or perhaps better called 'the gladiator pen', is filled with youths ranging 12-16.  Other than in Lord of the Flies, when do we ever see THAT premise?  So- 2 stars for an engaging story, 1 star for a VERY fast read (ideal for a plane ride or sitting by a pool) and the fact that although its a young readers book, its enjoyable for some adults too, and 1 star for writing a novel that has encouraged teenagers to actually READ something other than texts(although the value of this particular 'read' is understandably debatable).  Finally: I would not have a problem with a teenager of mine reading this book; much more violence is on-screen and on TV, even in Transformers or Mission Impossible, so I doubt they'd be overly disturbed despite the story's disturbing elements.
0345803493|4.0|And so the story of Christian and Ana continues.  Once again I have given it 4 stars, though it will never get a literary prize.<br /><br />After being left hanging in book 1, I'll point out that the wait isn't long before C & A are back together.  Though I would have liked to see Ana hold out more than 6 hours, seriously. She needs a ride and they are back together.<br /><br />I think book 2 was my least-liked of the three books.  Of course, there is repetition of the repetition in the first books; same words, phrases, sex,sex,sex.  (Which is why the reviews are so repetitious.) If you can get past that, and that is a BIG IF, you will enjoy the story continue to unfold.

0345803485|4.0|I had to do 4 stars, and I say this, somewhat unfortunately.  3 stars means \\"ok\\", 4 \\"I liked it\\" So 4 stars it is.<br /><br />I did like it, I liked the story, I liked the characters, for the most part, and I did keep reading.<br /><br />BUT, as everyone else has said: The book is poorly written.  It's written as if it's for 14 year olds, but clearly there is way to much sex in this book (and a lot of other stuff I wouldn't want my teen daughter to be reading) for young, impressionable girls.<br /><br />People reading reviews are probably tired of the repetitious comment that the book is repetitious.  Well, it is! Extremely.  Words and phrases appear over and over and over and over and over. The sex happens over and over and over and over.  The annoyance you will feel regarding this issue will be exacerbated if you are a fast reader, because you will encounter these words more quickly.  I hope to never hear the word \\"mercurial\\" again.  (Honestly I don't know why anyone would use it in the first place---it just doesn't roll off the tongue.)<br /><br />If you are the type of person that doesn't like to be left hanging, expect to get book 2.  After reading book 1, book 2 was not an option for me, of course I had to keep reading to find out what happened.<br /><br />I recommend you take these books out from the library or borrow them from someone. I can't imagine most people will read these books multiple times (though I can tell you that the ending of book 3 does want to make you go back and read the beginning of book 1 again).<br /><br />And don't let your kids get a hold of them.

1407109367|5.0|2nd book in the Hunger Games trilogy doesn't disappoint!  Good action, twists and the characters we loved (and hated, but loved to read about) from the first one!  Very entertaining!
B007SYWFRM|1.0|This game is deceptive at best.  It took me 3 or 4 minutes to figure out how to get my son out of the screen after he played it.  Additionally while you can earn credits to spend on things in game attempting to use those credits takes you to a game screen that offers purchase of those items paying USD dollars.  It could have easily caused my son to inadvertantly purchase items while trying to use his credits to buy items.<br /><br />I deleted the game off my kindle once I realized its deceptive nature.<br /><br />I receommend you stay away from this game.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|Very enjoyable program. Free app. Kids and adults love this program. Everyone I show it to wants it and usually gets it.
0345529057|5.0|This series was an impulse buy because it is a good deal.  I was surprised to see how detailed they are and realize that the HBO series needs 10 episodes for the first book.  It is a time sucker, so get a comfortable reading spot!

0399159029|5.0|There are  so many good reviews of this novel written here already that I merely add my two cents worth. Once again Phillip Kerr provides us a fascinating look at life in Germany (and Prague) during the Nazi years. His Commissar Bernie Gunther is an honest detective in these trying times, but his mouth often has him at odds with those who could end his life.<br />Obviously they don't, or we wouldn't have so many excellent Gunther novels. The synopsis of the story is provided already. You can tell that I am a fan by the five stars. If you read one, you feel like reading another one.
B00634GHJA|3.0|I looked at it with the idea of using it to transfer video to my phone from my computer.  Nice interface... but the file browser is ludicrously limited. You can only transfer a couple of video formats. No avi or divx.  Major drawback.  Perhaps a future release will solve this oversight. A &quot;browse all files&quot; option would be ideal.<br /><br />Uninstalling.
B000244EMO|5.0|\\"Predator\\" is by far my favorite movie ever, it is the epitome of everything that was great about 80's action films. There are tons of explosions, loads of cheesey dialogue, steroid induced muscles galor, and let's not forget the human hunting alien that stalks it's eventual prey.<br /><br />Taking place in the Guatemalan jungle, Arnold Schwarzenegger and his band of elite commandos must find and bring back some supposed CIA agents who crashed on the wrong side of the border. Taking orders from one-time friend Dillon(actor Carl Weathers), joins the small band and quickly finds out that Guatemalan rebels may be the least of their worries.<br /><br />After discovering the crashed helo, Schwarzenegger and crew, led by Native American guide Billy, track the rebels to a small base in the jungle, and commence blowing the living crap out of everything and everyone in sight. Upon destruction of the base, the group discovers that Dillon cooked the whole story up for them to do his \\"Dirty Work\\". Knowing the group wasn't interested in being hit-men, Dillion does what government agents do best, LIE! Angry and ready to split, Arnold and crew are told there is no chance of an evac, the area is to hot for pick up. The group must hoof through the treacherous jungle terrain.<br /><br />During their trek through the bad bush, the group starts to disappear one-by-one. Nobody knowing what has happened, and everyone's blood starting to hit a boiling point. When Blaine(Jesse Ventura) gets killed with a electric charge his buddy Mac(Bill Duke) sees the creature and proceeds to destroy half the jungle with a Vulcan Mini gun. Slowly but surely the group is reduced in strength, until there is nobody left but Arnold and the Predator.<br /><br />The fight between Arnold Schwarzenegger and Kevin Peter Hall, a.k.a. the Predator, is of epic 80's proportions. You have knives, grenades, lasers, bows and arrows, fists and even a tree trap. The epic clash ends as you would expect, Arnold destroys the alien, saves humanity and lives to kill another day.<br /><br />I can't make you like this movie, but i'm sure after one watch you'll see why this is one of the most enduring movie characters of all time. It's just flat-out awesome!alien, saves humanity and lives to kill another day.<br /><br />I can't make you like this movie, but i'm sure after one watch you'll see why this is one of the most enduring movie characters of all time. It's just flat-out awesome!
0345803485|1.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is not the first book I've thrown across the room - it's the second - but it is the first book I also kicked after it hit the floor.<br /><br />Am I a book snob? Sure. I have a degree in English, I write, and I've taught literature in public schools. But I am also the all-American mother and housewife who can enjoy my small share of erotic fiction without judging the literary chops of the authors who pander to me.<br /><br />However. \\"E.L. James,\\" for whatever she set out to accomplish, should have first accomplished finding either a proofreader or an editor at the esteemed publishing houses who bothered to put her trilogy in print.<br /><br />Let me say that everything I am about to complain about is based on nothing but the first 40-something pages of book #1, because I got no further.<br /><br />First, the Fifty Shades of Grey is set around a college campus in Washington state. That's America, y'all. So the charming British-isms that James thinks make her sound like a high-minded writer (living in London though she is) are incongruities. Eighteen-year-old American co-eds do not \\"phone\\" their roommates - they \\"call\\" them. They should be making \\"dinner,\\" not \\"supper,\\" and they certainly should not be ordering their tea \\"bag out.\\"<br /><br />(In addition to being a reader, writer, and teacher, I also paid my dues as a waitress, and I never once served a guest, even a guest with a polished overseas accent, tea with the \\"bag out.\\" The phrase just does not exist in our culture. And the only people who referred to their meal as \\"supper\\" were over sixty and southern.)<br /><br />Second, on page 24 to be specific, the word \\"besieged\\" is used twice within a few sentences of each other, describing the same crowd of consumers at a hardware store. I already suggested introducing James to a proofreader - now I shall suggest a thesaurus.<br /><br />And ditto with my third complaint. Her characters can only \\"mutter\\" and \\"murmur\\" so many times on a page, before we, the readers, might desperately offer to buy the author a new verb. Regardless of the overuse of \\"mutter,\\" specifically, I would venture to suggest that it's the wrong verb altogether. The lovely and shrinking Anastasia would certainly not be \\"muttering.\\" She might be speaking haltingly, or she might be whispering shyly, or she might be choking out an awkward response. But \\"muttering\\"? Let's use a dictionary, in addition to our thesaurus, James.<br /><br />And make sure it's an American dictionary, not a British one.<br /><br />Fourth. I cut James a break when Anastasia and Christian show no continuity in whether they refer to each other by their first names, or as Ms. Steele and Mr. Grey. (Aren't those clever last names? What were the chances?) I decided the characters were on such unstable, sexually-charged ground with each other that whether to be formal or familiar was a question constantly in a state of flux. But when the two inhumanly beautiful characters sit at a coffee shop (while the American teenaged Ana drinks her tea \\"bag out\\") and have a conversation regarding why Christian does not invite Anastasia to call him by his first name - without ever mentioning the fact that she already has, repeatedly - that's when Fifty Shades of Grey became airborne.<br /><br />Housewives of America, or England, with a penchant for smut - please, put pen to paper and continue to delight and thrill us, we with the small boring lives, who would love to invite a Christian Grey into our beds. But before your book sees a binding, please also make sure that you're not bringing the entire professions of writing and publishing down into the steamy lower-levels of erotic literature with you. I understand that I needed to lower my expectations when I read on the publisher's page that this book originally appeared online as a serialized novel, written by \\"Snowqueen Icedragon,\\" but even a Snowqueen could have used an editor.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Classic movie in high definition blu-ray DVD.......very enjoyable and a great birthday purchase for this favorite movie of a dear loved one.....so thank you Amazon for the heads up about this special.....I got a great gift at a great price!!!!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|E.L. James will have you addicted to Christian and Ana. There will be moments you will want to yell at her and throw things at Christian- there will even be moments you'll want to throw the book/kindle against the wall... Resist the urge and it'll ALL be worth it!! I finished all 3 books in 4 days- you'll be hard pressed not to want to do the same!
B0059XTUVI|2.0|Ms Streep's performance was fine<br />But for me the whole concept of this movie was simply insane. I found it extremely confusing to be constantly whipsawing back and forth in time, in & out of reality & hallucinations.<br />I did find about 5 or 6 brief moments in the film that were VERY good.<br /><br />HOWEVER, this was not a portrait of Ms Thatcher that I expected, and I'm guessing that it is more or less accurate.<br />. . IF THAT IS THE CASE, then the film did us a service.<br />BTW- I loved the King's Speech, The Queen, (I'm not a Brit), there was a PBS/BBC thing about 2 years back about one of the royal kids who had down syndrome or something that was great too.<br />***<br /><br />FOR MUCH BETTER, ABOUT MS THATCHER:<br />START WITH<br />Documentary- Margaret Thatcher - Long Walk to Finchley (BBC) - UTube (90min)<br />This is about young Ms Thatcher up to the point of getting elected to Parliament, at that time she was the first and only female. This was a long, difficult ordeal for her with MANY defeats, in a Brit-version of the Good-ole-boys club.<br /><br />NEXT GOTO the Documentary-style:<br />Documentary- Margaret Thatcher - Downing Street Years - also on UTube (4hours)<br />This series shows pretty clearly why she is a Conservative's Dream Politician<br />She had utter, and unshakable confidence and belief in herself, and like Reagan, GWB, Cheney, didn't believe in ever questioning her assumptions.<br />AND her only interest was in being effectively a dictator.<br />NOTE= In Britain, the PM isn't elected directly by the voters. The PM is elected by ruling party in Parliament, so that you never have a situation which is common in America of Divided-Government.<br /><br />Hope this helps
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is so much fun. you would think it would become boring but with the goals it has and the fun extras u can buy with the nuts you earn it stays interesting. I would definitely recomend this app. :)
B007MNV5WU|5.0|there are acctully more than two worlds there is the one with all the bombs floating around. it is a great game.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|good game., but it doesn't. give you an easy way to go back to the home screen. should. be a quick fix so fix it. :)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|very fun and educational. my son really enjoys this and he gets to learn what pioneers had to do. only he gets to learn in a more exciting way.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Unlike the original version this one blows. Overly involved and the program doesn't save the progress that the game is based on.
0099579944|5.0|I thought this was a great ending to the series... after all the frustration with their relationship... back and forth it can be exhausting! I loved how they took you past the happily ever after and showed you their story. I was sad to have finished the book.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game reminds me of mario!!! I love this game so much and I have had so much fun playing and sharing this game!!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this app you can design your very own restraut I rate this app five stars it is the best
B000H4QD1O|4.0|Good series, sad it ended.  Unlike many too soon canceled shows... Firefly was able to wrap up a lot of questions with the movie Serenity. This show still has fans and stamina... There are yearly Serenity parties in several states and many people go back and re-watch favorites episodes or the entire series. Good show... watch a few episodes then buy the series.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this app it is the best app avabile and I like to spend my free time playing this game#!!!! so everyone should get it is free so get it
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I used to check this app constantly throughout the day and it made me feel better during stormy weather, but now it rarely updates to the current weather. It does not help me at 7am to know what the temp was at 10pm the previous day. Very, very frustrating.  I've moved on to a different weather app.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm amazed this is a 'NY Times Bestseller' and would not recommend this book at all.  I read a lot of books, and I have to say this is the first one in a year that I had to MAKE myself finish (just because I hate not completing a book I start).  My main problem with this book is that (to me) it has no story line and is just one long sex scene.  I don't mind sex scenes mixed in to enhance a story, BUT (once again in my opinion) that's all this book is, one long sex scene with minimal plot or character development.  Thumbs down from my perspective.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|on kindle my houses should give $ every minute but says 300 hours till ready again' please fix!!! otherwise I love this game and and horribly addicted to it
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book!!! Although there were a few things left to be desired about the writing of the book, the ability to keep the reader hooked and wanting more was more than sufficient.  The interest and eroticism in the book was yummy.  I have many friends and co-workers who have read the book and we all have come to the same conclusion, this book has brought back flames of desire for us all.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|its cool. i hav been using all my spare time playing this df df dfd dfd hg hg hg hg
B006X8GFBQ|3.0|This is daring venture for one of my favourite authors. He's come back in time a little closer to our time. Nothing wrong with that and much of the bio- and technological advances Alastair sees are still inspiring and interesting to read about. And I like the twist, in which the African and Indian cultures are now economically in the lead. But the story itself is uncharacteristically slow-paced. The characters are well-developed, but it takes a very long time before you can start to relate to them. Nonetheless; you still have to read this book! It's only by comparison to its peers by the same author that you can be critical about it. So delve into the near-distant future and discover what Alastair holds in store for us this time.
B00634GHJA|3.0|Especially if you can get it to work remotely, like from a coffee shop or wherever there's wifi, but if you're at home, it's much faster plugging the usb cable in and be done with it. If you have to go to the computer anyway.....
0374275637|3.0|Let me start by declaring a bias: I love pop-science books. I'm fairly happy with the hard core scientific tomes too, but pop-science brings together two of my passions - science and literature, and hence I tend to view most such books through a favourable lens.<br /><br />Fast & Slow started off fairly well, and Kahneman's writing felt lucid and thoughtful. The introductory chapters held promise of a book that would develop well and give me lots to think about, and provide some useful guidance in my everyday life. About halfway through the book, however, against my strong desire to go on, I gave up, and here's why: the book was going nowhere. It wasn't that it stopped being insightful - it was just that it seemed more like a collection of interesting examples than a collected, coherent development. Individually, the chapters did not feel unpleasant, and in fact contained a lot of knowledge and insight that I was unfamiliar with and found engrossing, but my objection is to putting all these chapters together as a book. Most books, outside of the text/ reference book variety, effectively become part of the greater body of literature, and should be viewed through that lens. I don't believe that books can be measured by different yardsticks on account of being clever, or being written by somebody famous or important, and consequently, I believe this book falls short.<br /><br />So, despite my bias towards this genre, my recommendation would be to read it as a background book, or better still, as a series of articles over a long-ish period of time. You might save yourself some of the disappointment that way and be able to enjoy, and complete this book.
B00634GHJA|2.0|While this app does what it says, and does it just fine, but sharing with Picassa or E-Mail via the standard Gallery app is easy enough that I find this app redundant.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Its a really fun and addictive game but there is one problem. With the Kindle Fire sometimes it doesn't respond to where your finger is right away, which results in FAILURE!!!!:D ITS FUN YOU SHOULD GET IT!! GET IT NOWWWWZ!!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this game but I hare when you exit out of you game to like read a book it sometimes does not save it
B006PHD0RW|3.0|Like the game but doesn't advise u how to move stuff around. But once u learn trial and error pretty fun.
B002N5N4M6|4.0|A good show with very funny moments . But it is somehow quite difficult to understand for people who are unaware of comic books world, video games or other things which are refered to all the time. Actualy this is the main topic of the show, to see \\"geek\\" characters and the way they experience the world through their unique personalities.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|This game is still very fun but after the Kindle update....it doesn't work right...freezes up.....friends option DOESN'T work, you can't add friends, you can't load friends, and you can't finish the goals.  I still play it but am disappointed that it hasn't been fixed yet.  The update should make things better....not worse!  So please fix...and everyone else change your reviews so they will fix!!!!
B001FB4W0C|5.0|A great Season ! We all wondered how Dean was supposed to get out of Hell but thanks to a well written scenario, it was made possible. Season 4 boost the show which was becoming less interesting in the season 3 from my point of view. A new Mythology and a new character that surprised everyone in such a good way. Keep on watching !
B0064X7FVE|2.0|it takes almost 4 hrs for the forecast to be updated after the website and the broadcast. sometimes longer. if you are looking for a weather app I assume you want an accurate forecast right now and not when they finally get around to changing the app...
B002JVWRAO|5.0|A great season ! But I keep thinking that it should have been the last. The way the episode ends was the best ending Supernatural could have had. Anyway always exciting to watch !
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is awesome, to exit it just go to the game settings. it is like ravenwood fair from facebook, if you like adventure games you will love this!
B00003CXRM|5.0|I'm not much for words but there has been few movies that have ever made me feel as immersed in or engaged in as this one does! I feel like I'm on an adventure when I watch it! I watch this movie at least once a month and still feel the same way every time! Watching it in 1080p is the way to go people!

B006R1T40I|5.0|Slipstream is Bonnie's most compelling album since Luck of the Draw--and the first by any artist in decades that I've played over and over and over right after my first listening!  Bonnie's slide guitar is as gutsy as ever, and her voice remains an enchantment that can get you dancing on the table in one moment and break your heart in the next.  Who knew that \\"Right Down the Line\\" could be so soulful?  (Love that snaky guitar hook.)  And \\"Take My Love with You,\\" which turns a couple's routine separations into an elegy of devotion, makes me weep.  I'm going to play both of them for my wife on our wedding anniversary.  Thank you, Bonnie!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Can be addictive, whether you play the story or the regular games. Lots of different tiles with different themes (not just Chinese),  in case you get too familiar with one set and it starts getting too easy. The story-line  lets you go against a clock,  and rewards you for speed,  but don't get too comfortable! The story will take you all over the world to collect artifacts, and gives you new sets of tiles to match your location. Get reward artifacts and bonuses if you're good!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is awesome! the characters actually look like the movie! they don't let you down! the graphics are really good and it doesn't Suck your money up like some other games!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am not normally a fan of futuristic type reading.  However, after hearing about The Hunger Games in various media hype, I decided to try it.  I was pleasantly surprised to find I could get it on my Kindle for about $5.00.  After reading several pages, I was hooked into the story and went on to read both the second and third books in the trilogy on my Kindle.  I have not seen the movie yet, but that is on my list of movies to see. A great read!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is an awesome game!Its addicting. Once I started playing it I couldn't stop.I was surprised that it was free.

145470246X|5.0|The months I waited to receive this book after my pre order were well worth it.  Every piece in this book is beautiful and I could work through the book project by project and make them all. I have ordered beads for my first effort and I know this book will get a lot of wear in the coming months.<br /><br />Sabine's directions are easily understandable through clear and concise explanation and diagram. Her flair and style sparkle through the patterns she has devised to keep beautiful stones exposed and gleaming while surrounding them with lovely shape and form. Her style is unique and her imagination and dedication are obvious in this gorgeous book of patterns.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like the game it just has a few issues when trying to visit neighbors. says u need an update and no matter how many times you accept it it still doesn't work makes it very difficult to complete some of the challenges
B004EPZ06Q|3.0|When Hangover 2 was release in theaters it was a most see for me. I laughed out loud and said its just like the first movie. After watching it a second time I notice it wasnt funny as the first. The story line is similar. one could guess where the Brother in law will be. The movie does live up to the series but might need a new story line. Just hope the third one is better than the second one.
B005723JSQ|4.0|\\"I've Got Your Number\\" is an entertaining and light-hearted novel that I thoroughly enjoyed reading.  I think that Sophie K's writing is creative, funny, and the perfect thing for someone who wants to escape into a well-written story.  Anyone who is expecting Shakespearean-styled writing, or completely accurate non-fiction writing, is bound to be disappointed and should think twice before purchasing this book.  On the other hand, I feel that anyone who can employ a sillier sense of humor and who has a mind open to creative scenarios will enjoy reading this novel.<br /><br />I agree with some reviewers who stated that the main characters, Poppy and Sam, while likeable, were reminiscent of Becky and Luke from the Shopaholic series.  I hope that SK doesn't become a purely formulaic writer; her imagination seems capable of greater things than just plugging new names into the same old story-lines.  For example, her novel \\"Twenties Girl\\" is my favorite that she's written.  I found it to be unique, and I laughed throughout that particular book.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book, with the caveat that there are similarities to Shopaholic, and that anyone who is looking for more of a non-fiction experience might want to look elsewhere.  Personally, I really liked this book and enjoy this author.
1423136802|5.0|I got totally involved in these books, which I was supposed to be checking out for suitability for my 11 year old grandson. Luckily I won't be seeing him until May as, once I started reading, I was not going to give the books over.<br /><br />I KNOW they were written for teenagers but I was kept completely enthralled by the story telling. There were definitely shades of Tolkein and Harry Potter there but Riordan has taken the basics and produced heroes in his own inimitable style. I just needed to keep on finding out what happened next.<br /><br />I was glad to have been able to read the complete set of books straight off, much better, IMHO, than reading one and then having to wait another year or so for the next installment.<br /><br />I shall be watching out for more of this author's series of books.
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|Great movie.  I saw it in the theater, and I wanted to add it to my DVD library.  I have other movies by the same director.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book gripped the reader from the first page and did not slow down through the whole book.<br />The story telling was of a high quality with the characters becoming real in the imagination.<br />This is the first Suzanne Collins novel I have read and it will not be the last!
0439023513|2.0|After reading the first 2 books, I was excited to see how everything would end.  But after reading it for a while, I figured out that I actually hated Katniss now.  She whines all the time and then blacks out every 5 seconds.<br /><br />Spoilers:<br /><br />It was hard to get into the book.  First off, I thought it was disappointing that she, being \\"The Mockingjay\\" was little more than a publicity stunt because she has no real will power to fight for anything.  As I read this I sit there and imagine a war going on where we have some 'face' of the war that isn't even seeing battle.  I guess it is like Captain America from Marvle and Uncle Sam from the old World War campaigns.  Personally wouldn't motivate me as much as seeing a bada** with a bow killing people.  What also doesn't make sense is she is so against fighting and killing people yet she really wants kill Snow.<br /><br />Killing Prim wouldn't be so bad.  Story doesn't have to be happy but the fact that Katniss has no real feelings after this is insane.  She should go on a rampage.  Instead, she is blacked out again and comes to and doesn't feel much of anything.  WTF, you volunteered your life in the first book for the girl.<br /><br />Once you get past the beginning of the book which is nothing but a whine fest of \\"I love Gale, I don't love Gale, I love Peeta, I don't love Peeta\\", you get to parts that get a little exciting but Collins is quick to ruin any momentum she had by having Katniss black out again.  I envision Katniss to be a fighter with some mental battles to overcome but this book just proved she is weak and wants someone else to take care of things.<br /><br />I could go on for hours but I won't, read the book and I guarantee you won't appreciate it as much as the first or second.<br /><br />All I can say is I hope the directors of the movie trilogy don't even attempt to make a movie authentic to this book because it will BLOW!  I wouldn't be able to stand to watch Katniss whine for 2 hours.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's taken me long enough to come in here and write this review. First off, I own a Kindle (with Prime) and I read a free sample on the 9th of the month. There was no way  I could wait until the 1st to roll around for the free download, so I went ahead and purchased this series. Best thing I could have ever done. Yes, I lost a lot of sleep and my sleeping schedule is out of wack, but this book makes you NEED to know what happens next. I'm so glad this author knows that his readers need more kicked out these books fast while keeping the quality at top. I don't know what I would have done if I had to wait a year in-between books. I may have gone mad. But I don't regret purchasing it one bit. The author keeps you interested by constantly developing characters and creating relationships on an emotional level that really pull you into the pages. I knocked this 5 book series out in 3 days and to my surprise noticed that a few weeks ago Howey came out with a prequel that leaves so many questions on WHY the silos were built answered that I couldn't have asked for a better 6th book. Patiently awaiting book 7. In the meantime I have picked up his other book Molly Fyde book 1 and can't wait to get started.<br /><br />I've been rambling on to my fiance about how good these books are (we love reading together, but he's more of an audio book type as he has a long commute) and just found out in a few short months an audio book will be released! Now he can bask in my nerdy glory with me for Howey books! I also noticed that I can LEND him a copy  for 2 weeks since I purchased the e-book. How awesome is that? I'll continue to share this book and continue to purchase these ebooks as they become available.
B006QVRUS2|4.0|There's an old SNL skit starring Will Ferrell that depicted a TV newscast team as it lost its teleprompter, and the ensuing bloodbath that eventually occurred.  The term \\"bloodbath\\" was correctly used, as the lack of prepared text somehow paves the way for the news team to devolve into its primal state, and by the end of ten minutes they actually begin cannibalizing one another in the midst of its hyperbolic chaos.<br /><br />The movie \\"Carnage\\" will probably impress you in much the same way.  Essentially a long one-act play, it enacts the meeting of two relatively affluent married couples who have previously agreed to get together in the living room of one of their apartments to discuss a previous spat involving their eleven year old sons on an urban playground, wherein one boy struck the other in the face with a stick.<br /><br />You might expect that that thread of a story is perhaps not enough to base a movie upon, especially given the fact that there is almost no change of setting other than a brief bathroom scene.  But you'd be wrong.  In fact, I was surprised when it ended a mere 75 minutes later.<br /><br />First off, \\"Carnage\\" is hilarious.  And what pedigree: directed by Roman Polanski, its cast consists entirely of Christoph Waltz, Kate Winslet, John C. Reilly, and Jodie Foster, other than a couple of long distance shots of some important secondary characters.<br /><br />Equally important is this statement: be aware this is Theater of the Uncomfortable.  If you are not a fan of, say, a long elevator ride with an arguing couple, you might not be able to sit through this film.  But if you can stick it out you will be richly rewarded.<br /><br />The movie begins with the wrapping up of a typed statement by the parents of the injured boy, with only one word substitution suggested by the parents of the boy who struck the other: originally said to be \\"armed\\" with a stick, it is later changed to \\"carrying.\\"  That said, Penelope (Foster) prints out the letter, the two couples separate to head out to an elevator as her husband Michael (played by Reilly) innocently suggests they might like to stay for an espresso.  With a nod, Alan and Nancy (Weisz and Winslet), step back into the apartment.<br /><br />And so it begins...<br /><br />Please take me at my word: this movie gets very uncomfortable.  As each couple absorbs or makes little digs and innuendos, it initially appears that the battle lines will be clear: it's the Cowans vs. the Longstreets, and when it all eventually breaks down it is natural to assume each parent will vigorously defend their son.<br /><br />At first terribly polite, the couples' marital issues are egged on by incessant phone calls and dog barks and alcohol and, well, vomit, forcing bothersome traits and affectionate nicknames and paranoias and prejudices to surface in all their ugliness.<br /><br />Yet there's much, much more, and I think it is fair to say that no one survives this debacle.  Not that we will witness the outcome; no, as I mentioned before, the film ends abruptly, but by then the battle lines have become so blurred and far-ranging that it is fair to say that the boys are the least of the offenders.  To paraphrase an old expression: no one gets out of here undamaged.<br /><br />I don't want to say too much...the beauty of this extremely talented cast is that they are able to ante up little moments and idiosyncrasies until they become cannon-fire, and there is no one here that I can truly admire when it's all over.  The skirmish between two boys get equal time alongside a pharmaceutical company's liabilities, the situation in Darfur, or the killing of a hamster.<br /><br />So, see \\"Carnage.\\"  It's quite enjoyable, if you've got the belly for it.e two couples separate to head out to an elevator as her husband Michael (played by Reilly) innocently suggests they might like to stay for an espresso.

B007PTJOV0|4.0|This is a fun and challenging game. There are 3 different slots, so 3 people can play on the same device without messing up each other's progress.
B00634GHJA|5.0|This app is the best thing since sliced bread. No longer have to hook up Kindle Fire to pc to get pics on it, and they go into your gallery. It completely saves a lot of time and frustration!!!  I love it!  Worked with my laptop and my Android phone.

1451627289|4.0|Have to admit about half way through King's new book I was starting to get a bit frustrated. I felt like King was overwriting, again, and that it was getting bogged down on a side story and there was no urgency.  In other words the wheels were just spinning with no forward motion. Than King moved the story toward a key relationship and it all started to change.  As I slogged into the last parts of the book I began to appreciate the details of the novel.  The amount of research King did on the history of the time and the details he provides leading up to that awful date is breathtaking. This central love story and all the \\"minor\\" characters that are interwoven around that story arch made me care about many of these characters.  The book connected with me more and I found that it \\"clicked\\" with me as almost all of King's stories have in the past.  When one his stories grabs me I know it is going to be a late couple of nights cause I just can't stop reading. And than the last 100 pages just blew me away = touching, harrowing, and memorable. Almost every King story has left there mark on me and I remember their pivotal moments as if I watched a movie of what he wrote 100 times.  The last part of this book did that and I am thankful I did not give up.  This is a book that deserves your patience.  While it may not have been what I was expecting I am glad I took this journey down memory lane. Yet again this author has provided me with a wonderful read that will last long after I finished the last sentence. Bravo Mr. King Bravo.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|tried several apps none of them worked like this one!!  I can get books from library online and they all work and fit the pages.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I've been using this app for a while, online, on my phone and now on my tablet. Useful is not enough to describe this app. I use it all the time to gather thoughts,  share info with colleagues,  plan and to prepare for public speaking. Now with my new tablet, I am totally paper free and I can archive my work for ages to come.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote save me from post-it notes, note books, and journals, that I carried with me. Now I just have one device with all my notes!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game. I wish there were less upsells nonetheless its enjoyable. its annoying when you run out of energy and have to wait it out
B00340I4KG|5.0|On the whole, I like John Travolta and Nicholas Cage, in some respects, Travolta plays an amazing badass bad guy and Nicholas Cage can play the good guy pretty damn good but in FACE OFF, there is a serious Role reversal of sorts.<br />Travolta plays an FBI Agent Sean Archer, who has been tracking terrorist Castor Troy for years and steps up the search after Troy \\"accidently\\" kills Archer's son while trying to kill him.<br />A gunfight ensues at the airport when troy tries to make his escape by plane and gets \\"killed\\" there without revealing where he planted a device, which when detonated, will kill the population of LA. (May have the city wrong, doing this by memory right now).<br />The only other person who knows the location of the device is Castor's brother and he's in prison and he isn't talking so there is a new technology that allows face transplants so the idea comes about to transplant Troys face onto Archer's body and plant Archer in prison, where he will get Troy's brother to tell him where the bomb is.<br />Unfortunately, this is a movie and everything doesn't go quite as planned, Troy wakes up from his \\"Death\\", which turned out to be a thought to be irreversible coma without his face, walks around the unit where the transplant took place and puts two and two together and decides to have his goons round up the team and bring them to the facility for a late night procedure.<br />And all of this is like in the first 45 minutes to an hour, of course, I left some stuff out but I can assure you, it just gets better from here.......Trouble ensues and loyalties are tested and this movie is one rip roaring BANGfest!<br /><br />This movie definitely gets 5 stars in my book as being one of Travolta's and Cage's best, I reccomend it to anyone who likes ACTION at it's finest!
B00634GHJA|4.0|I really like this app. I thought it was really easy to use. and now my pics and videos aren't taking up space on my phone.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Book 1 of Hunger Games is a reminisce of the Old Mythology of Pyramus and Thisbe meets Braveheart set in the land of Predator. Extremely climactic and hard to put down. You root for Peeta, the need understand Katniss, and you feel that the Capitol is referring to how our world is now: controlled by Media.<br />I am a huge fan of the Final Fantasy genre and this book reminds me of the setting, the plot, and the never-ending collision of forbidden love and Government.<br />Can't wait to read Book 2.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It kept me turning the pages and didn't want to put it down. Great to the last page.

1450419895|5.0|This is a major addition to the original Strength Training Anatomy book.  This book is split into three parts.  Part 1 is a pretty short part devoted to advanced techniques, while Part 2 is all about the exercises and the physiology behind the exercises.  This is not a how to book, but it does a very good job of illustrating the exercises and the major muscle groups being trained through fantastic color photographs and detailed drawings of the muscles affected in cut away views etc.  Part 3 is a short section on how to strengthen weak areas.<br /><br />The book is very much concentrated on the musclehead kind of exercises, i.e. it does not really address anything that has anything to do with working out muscle groups in conjunction with one another.  The emphasis is on building up individual muscles and obtaining the lean body builder look and mass.  Definition is the key.<br /><br />I wish that the authors would go into detail for the Olympic weight exercises, and show how the various muscle groups work in conjunctions and where one muscle group takes over from another and where the chain of muscular transfer happens.  But that was never the intent of the series.  It was to show how each large muscle group works, how to build them up and give the reader an idea as to how it all works.<br /><br />This is an admirable book, it must have taken an immense effort to represent all the exercises and muscles in pictorial form.  The book is incredibly thorough and quite informative for those who wants to understanding what they are doing without going headlong into the complete physiological and bio-mechanical studies.
0345803485|1.0|The writing in this book is absolutely awful, the characters are undeveloped and inconceivable. The dialog is ridiculous, and the sex scenes are steamy at first, but then become preposterous.<br />The 21 yr old main female character has never felt  the need to satisfy herself, much less be with a man/women (i.e. she's frigid her whole life).. But by way of this Steele character (who is completely unbelievable), she orgasms with a simple touch of a nipple or elsewhere. Totally ridiculous and a waste of time reading this. A total slog
0812992792|3.0|One can best understand the value of this book beyond its story line, so well critiqued by other reviewers, in terms of current events.<br /><br />On Friday April 13, 2012, with 100 foreign journalists in-country to witness their \\"triumph,\\" North Korea tested a missle capable of hitting the USA. Despite the fact that it blew up shortly after launch, the journalists were rushed to a large plaza holding one hundred thousand North Korean citizens aligned in perfect rows and columns who waved pink pom poms in exact unison as 50-foot tall statues of the Great Leader and his son were unveiled. The masses then quickly dispersed on some silent command leaving the plaza empty and spotless of debris. The journalists hardly knew what to say while trying to report live to their cameras.<br /><br />Before reading \\"The Orphan Master's Son\\" this phenomenon would be a complete puzzle. Now it makes sense. Although this book's plot is fictional, the author's portrayal of North Korea's personality-worshipping police-state culture enforced by brutality rang true to me as the masses raised their silly pom poms in unison.<br /><br />The plot does jump around. The main character Pak Jun Do experiences more adventures, hardships, lucky breaks and near misses than Indiana Jones. By the end you have difficulty believing that he is the same person who began life in an orphanage where most children are sold off in to one form of slavery or another. Some scenes are ghastly. Despite these misgivings, it is a compelling story worth reading. Author Adam Johnson did his homework, visited many parts of North Korea personally and researched personal accounts of people who have escaped including a prison camp escapee (needless to say, extremely rare).<br /><br />I knocked off two stars for the plot and character related reasons cited above, since there are no 1/2 stars in Amazon's rating system (3.5 would be my rating if that were so). The most important aspect of this novel to me is that it illustrates and illuminates the mysterious nature of life in North Korea today. After reading this book I have done a good deal of my own research and find myself more engaged with news and current events in the two Koreas, which previously I largely ignored. Perhaps it may have the same effect on you.es and illuminates the mysterious nature of life in North Korea today.

B00634GHJA|3.0|I don't really want to rate the app down since it does what it says it does, so I'm putting it at a 3.<br /><br />However, I'm not sure how this can be a paid app when Dropbox and SugarSync are both free and have this plus additional functionality.  Devs deserve to get paid for their work, but this is reinventing a horse-carriage wheel when a sports-car wheels already exist.  I use both Dropbox and SugarSync, and SugarSync automatically saves any photo or video I take with my phone to \\"the cloud\\", and thus syncs those with ALL of my devices.  Since it's backed up in SugarSync's cloud, it also gives me additional data protection from ever losing those photos/videos.<br /><br />Beyond that, I'm able to go into SugarSync and select any folder out of my phone, tablet, or PC and tell it to \\"Sync\\".  From there, I have access to all of that data anywhere.  So, it's not limited to photos and videos.  Some apps like Mindjet (mind-mapping software) allow me to select what folder I use to save their docs in, which allows me to use the same save files across both my tablet and phone.<br /><br />So, anyway, not saying this is a bad app, just that you can get the same and more functionality for free via either Dropbox or SugarSync (and probably others).
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|There was just so much hype about this movie when it came out--so many grown women crying and people talking about the black princess and complaining about her being a frog--I just had no desire to see this.  Despite the fact that I'm black.<br /><br />But we saw a preview on our Snow White DVD and I was charmed. So we bought it. Boy was I surprised.<br /><br />Now, all three of my kids (aged almost-5, and 2.25 years) love this movie. But they love anything that says Disney in the front. In fact, they really love the Disney logo itself, and that castle sequence at the beginning of every movie where Tinkerbell sprinkles fairy dust or whatever. This is their current favorite, though.<br /><br />No, what surprised me was how much _I_ loved this movie. And not just because Tiana is the most beautiful Disney princess EVER. I loved that her family was poor but happy. I loved that her best friend was a rich, white girl who was NICE. I loved that self-absorbed (Charlotte and Naveen) did not mean evil.  I loved that none of the evils perpetrated in this movie were about LOOKS--in fact, they were all about money and power (pretty realistic). I love that Naveen and Tiana did not fall instantly in love. I love that Naveen, Tiana, and even Charlotte all grow. All of the secondary characters are interesting and fun, but I LOVED Raymond the firefly. He's your typical slapstick sidekick except that he's intelligent (also great, with the Cajun accent). I loved that there was no evil woman, and that the evil voodoo man wasn't an idiot. Of course, it was awesome that Tiana didn't care at all about being a princess, and that she works hard and has a reasonable talent. There were lots of other things to love, but I don't remember them all right now.  Oh yeah, I even loved that Naveen could play an instrument! And that the evil voodoo man was a real show-stealer, kind of like Ursula in _The_Little_Mermaid_. And I thought it was GREAT that race was a non-issue in the whole movie and thatthe couple at the end was interracial and unremarked (not at all realistic for the time period, but it's a morality tale for today's youth, not the 1920s).<br /><br />A lot of people have complained about the music, which I don't really see. The songs grew on me, even though I don't like jazz or zydeco or gospel. My favorite piece was Facilier's \\"Friends on the Other Side\\" with that awesome line \\"You got what you wanted/But you lost what you had!\\" But all of the songs forward the story and are stylistically appropriate, and they certainly get us all singing along. Whether you like them is a case of personal taste, not of the writer's technical proficiency.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about this movie, was a throw-away line by Tiana when Mama Odie asks her to taste the gumbo. She says it needs Tabasco. It feels so pat to me, like the only thing special about Cajun cooking is Tabasco. Couldn't it have needed more Okra, or something? It bugged me.  But it lasted all of 5 seconds.<br /><br />I thought this movie was great and is a great movie for kids to see (with parental supervision in the younger ages, until they are used to the scary bits). Its values are modern and well-conceived, and the quality is on a par with any other Disney animated feature, in my opinion.  I hope you enjoy it as much as we do!
B005GK6Q6G|3.0|I pretty much agree with all the superlatives lavished on this inspired album. But I deduct two stars for Steve taking writing credit for Peter Green's \\"the Supernatural\\" , which Steve calls \\"The Four Winds: East\\", and for the old blues classic, \\"Catfish Blues\\" which Steve calls \\"Catwalk\\". When a friend and I advised Steve of the errors on the composing credits, Steve essentially blew us off. I understand making mistakes, but denying them, and not rectifying the errors, is unconscionable. Steve should be ashamed. But other than that, this is a spectacular album.
B0053KWDES|5.0|This being my first headphone amp I do not really have anything to compare it to however let me just say that I paired this amp with my HTC EVO 4G and a pair of Sennheiser 598's and boy did it make the 598's start to sing. The 598's always sounded rather muddy when plugged into my phone, but that was to be expected I think, however they now sound great. Watch the volume, the amp really increased the volume potential, the first time around I almost injured myself.<br /><br />Now for the fun of it I paired this device with my XM radio unit in my car. The volume range has just increased many-fold and I do think the sound quality has improved however it could just be the volume is now overcoming the road/wind noise finally. either way the E11 will now be pulling double duty.<br /><br />All in all it does what it says it does and it works well.  The easily replaceable battery will be nice if it dies and the construction in hand feels reasonably solid yet sufficiently light.  I do not worry that it will survive an inevitably clumsy moment (as with most portable devices) but a more hard spill, fall or wipe out while riding I am not so sure about.

0307592731|5.0|I bought this book,From Amazon so I could be included in a book club on line. It arrived very quickly.<br />  \\"Wild\\" by Cheryl Strayed.  She felt lost and didn't know who she was supposed to be. after reading this book, I feel like I know both the trail and Cheryl.  Her descriptions of the trail and the friends she meets there are memorable. and she seems to find out just who she is. A very strong woman.  this makes one wish to strap on a back pact and go to see what Cheryl saw on her trip.  it was also a teaching experience for back packers.  I really liked this book.

B005EGXTEE|5.0|Hunger Games is considered a young adult book but it is well worth a read by all adults. Much like John Marsden's books, it has an appeal that transcends the young adult genre. The book is well paced and I found it difficult to put down. I found its post apocalyptic setting made it quite reminiscent of a book published over 50 years earlier - \\"The Chrysalids\\" by John Wyndham. Like John Wyndham's novels, it is futuristic rather than science fiction and contains eternal themes, not least of which is the instinct for survival, the desire for success and the need for love and respect. Highly recommended.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game to play much action good graphic I would recommend. this game to all my friends best games tor tbr money
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm not one for writing book reviews but I had to say something after reading Wool.  This is by far the most original and interesting book that I've read in a long time. The way the author unfolds the facts little by little throughout the whole book kept me riveted and I didn't want it to end. Just when you think you have a handle on things there's another twist.  It's going to be a hard act to follow.

B00356CO1E|5.0|At the beginning of March 2012 I hit an all-time high of 164 lbs. I was unhappy and I was stuck. I had stopped eating the junk food and I had cut out soda and barely consumed any alcohol but I wasn't exercising. So I looked into this video and it was one of the best things I could have ever done. I finished the 10 days of level 3 about a week and a half ago. I'm now down to 144 so 20 lbs. are gone! I feel better and I'll be honest, I had a few days where I wasn't able to work out due to work and such, but if you get on the routine of doing this just about every day, the workouts will work for you and kicks your metabolism up to be able to keep the weight off. I'm now going to start over with level 1 and do it without the modifications! :) Highly recommended for anyone who wants to kick some of that weight off and look and feel great!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This game is pretty fun. Not as good as the original or Rio, but still enjoyable. Runs good on my Kindle Fire. Luckily I haven't seen the porn ads ppl have mentioned.

B004Q7CIFI|1.0|Has aboslutely no redeming quality.<br /><br />Mr. King has lost his touch.  This book may be usefull as a door stop or for ripping the pages out to start a fire, but do yourself a favor and don't read it!!<br /><br />If this is all he is able to procuce now, then he just needs to do the reading world a favor and retire before he kills any more trees with this level of crap.<br /><br />Perhaps if he started doing drugs again his writing may improve??
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|This game is really fun until it starts glitching. the other reviews are right, it will turn a 1 min respawn time into 49 hours and there's nothing you can do to fix it. it happened to me twice. sad to do it, but had to uninstall.
B003EV6DBM|4.0|My only complaint is that the DVD cases, the circle part that holds the actual discs, were all broken! The tiny circle parts were all completely chipped. So when I open the case I have to be careful to catch the discs. Not cool.<br />BUT the discs weren't scratched and work perfectly. Great show!!
0385342063|4.0|Kinsella is one of my favorite authors.  Her books are so fun to read, perfect for the beach. While rating I've Got Your Number, I found myself asking if I had never read her other books would I still have rated it four stars? The story seemed a bit forced in places and seemed a bit flat.  Four stars seems fair to me.<br /><br />Kinsella falls back on her tried and true formula in this book.  Girl is dating a hottie who is so Mister Wrong.  Mr. Right shows up and eventually sweeps her off of her feet. I would prefer to see Kinsella mix it up a bit, add some uncertainty for the reader.  I feel as if I'm eating yet another Swanson's TV dinner after being promised Beef Wellington.  She is such a talented author.  I hope she takes more time with her future stories.  Were that all authors were as talented as she is.

1557048630|4.0|The art was absolutely amazing! Seriously BEAUTIFUL. The only thing bad was that the book binding was absolutely horrid. I brought it over to my family dinner night and the kids flipped out and were begging to go through it. But after a couple times of the book being passed around, I noticed that the binding started to crack, and some pages started to feel a little loose. Luckly i've worked at a library so I know where to get it fixed. But I was a little saddend by this. Still, its totally worth it. Just be extra carefull with it, and keep it away from small children. Also it helped improve my digital art a bunch. Just by studying the backround art, i've learned different ways of coloring, and tones. Dreamworks in my opinion surpasses Disney on this one. Seriously, All the feels.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I loved Season 1 but I was hesitant about season 2 after I read so many bad reviews. I have just finished  looking at Part 1, and I was so glad I bought this...<br /><br />This is a very entertaining period drama. The first scene opens with a harsh view of the war going on; Matthew and other soldiers mud coated  and experiencing the horrors of the trenches,and then that haunting, beautiful theme music begins and we see the same opening credits as we saw in Season 1. Then, we are back in Downton, the lush livng rooms and polished furniture and the maids scuttling around this stately  manor house now undergoing changes as the long fingers of the war reaches even the gentry.<br /><br /> I found myself laughing out loud at scenes \\"presided over\\" by Dame Maggie Smith...she has the best lines! In this season, Lady Mary has changed dramatically, and we really feel that she has learnt her lesson and we sympathise with her because her heart has genuinely been broken. We find ourselves rooting for her, even when gossip about her past exploits keep coming up....<br /><br />Altogether this Season 2 is well written, moves dramatically forward with surprisng twists and turns and is a successful and enjoyable one. Cant wait for Season 3!
0439023513|1.0|I loved the first two books and the movie (action, romance, good plot, conspiracy) but the third book took an entirely different twist.  No you don't expect their lives to be a fairy tail but you don't expect the characters to lose their personal traits, morph into something else, make choices that make little sense, have the romance between one suiter end with no explanation, and never really know if Katniss's final action was correct.<br /><br />By the end you start to not care if Katniss has a happy ending, but you want some of the other characters to be OK.  The most repulsive part is that she didn't insist on rescuing Peeta and the others as one of her conditons to be the Mockingjay, but she also breaks promises (to Johana) and is still very self-centered.  I hated the part about tortue and really didn't expect it to be that bad (the series didn't start off about war).<br /><br />I think most of the audiance wanted one romance to blossom, but both fizzled out and in the end she did took what she could get.  The ending with Snow and Coin, it would have been nice for some sort of additional piece of informaton to know that she made the right choice.  I know that war changes people and it had to come down to a battle but the ending could have been so much better.  I hope that hollywood changes the ending and excludes the tortue stuff (Johana and the Avox).  This was the most disapointing story (3rd book only) that I have ever read.
B0059XTUXQ|4.0|Born in the 70s I have vague memories of Thatcher and Reagan.  I liked how they portrayed the subject matter, mostly in flashbacks.  It brought a sense of time to the piece and was original.  The flashbacks to me brought a sense of humanity to Thatcher, with the typical young to middle age Thatcher portrayed in snippets instead of taking all of the film.  I like the idea that we will all end up like she was in the film, old and nearing death.  However she had good memories and very proud achievements to reflect on, and at least for me made me reflect a bit on what I may be like in 40 more years if I live that long.  The bits with her husband, and her children I thought brought her humanity to the stage, and not just the political achievements she had.  It was original, had some human depth, and portrayed a human being in the frailty of old age which some people may find disconcerting.  If you want something more than the Biography channel type of standard fare, then check it out.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|An engaging read, The Hunger Games keeps you connected to the story making it very hard to put the book down.  Highly recommend it as a weekend read!
B002PA8Q1S|1.0|This is the most disturbing movie I have ever seen. It depicts sexual, deviant violence against women. Just thinking about it still bothers me years after seeing it. A young person should NEVER see this movie! I wish I had not seen it.
B004GXA5U2|2.0|This book is light-hearted in its attempt to relate the story of a working mother.  Unfortunately the working mother, at the centre of the story, is not a true reflection of the majority of working mums.  The conflict she feels is probably very familiar to most mothers, but it is a bit indulgent and certainly not the great read I was expecting.
B006ZWLXZ8|4.0|New York singer and songwriter Elizabeth Grant- known to the public as Lana Del Rey- isn't exactly an overnight celebrity. Despite her instant rise to fame in 2011, she was actually recording a couple of years prior. She signed with an independent label in 2008 to release the EP \\"Kill Kill\\". She followed it up with her 2010 debut \\"Lana Del Rey AKA Lizzy Grant\\" with production help from David Kahne (The Bangles, Sugar Ray, Sublime). Over a year and a half later, she signed with Interscope Records to record her sophomore effort. She issued the single \\"Video Games\\"- which got instant attention. From there, she emerged at the end of January 2012 with her new album \\"Born To Die\\". Her major label debut takes musical inspiration from the likes of Nancy Sinatra as well as the music found in the films of director David Lynch. An album that recalls the sounds and sultry ballads from the chanteuses of yesteryear. In fact, the best way to describe her recording is to imagine a Fiona Apple album if it was produced by Kanye West.<br /><br />She starts the album off with the melancholic title track \\"Born To Die\\" which leads into the alcohol induced sexual romp \\"Off To The Races\\". She sings of a distant lover on retro-styled \\"Blue Jeans\\", and gets romantically involved with a rich man on \\"National Anthem\\". She questions the status of a relationship on \\"Diet Mountain Dew\\" and laments the loss of an old flame on \\"Dark Paradise\\". On the ballad \\"Carmen\\", Lana tells the sad story of a teenage girl and her downward spiral into self destruction. She closes the album with the ode to the lovelorn crowd of teenagers on \\"That's What Makes Us Girls\\", which was produced by Alexander \\"Al Shux\\" Shucksburgh (best known for Jay-Z's \\"Empire State Of Mind\\"). Although the album is well produced, well written and beautifully arranged, the only thing that's holding this album back is Lana's sometime off-key singing. However, the real star of \\"Born To Die\\" is the album's producer Emile Haynie (Eminem, Obie Trice, Kid Cudi) whose arrangements and production makes this album worth listening to. In short, Lana Del Rey's album is a good effort, but her performances are a little distracting and could use a little work. She shows a lot of promise on here, but could stand to be more focused vocally.ie Trice, Kid Cudi) whose arrangements and production makes this album worth listening to.

B001NESPHC|3.0|Melody Gardot has a range reminsicent of Billie Holiday's and a timbre suggestive of the quietly seductive qaulity of Brazil's Astrud Gilberto.  Someone who has survived a life-threatening hit-and-run accident and who lives in chronic pain (coping through the use of a TENS device), Melody brings to mind similar recent, heroic, talented singers like the late Nancy LaMott and Eva Cassidy or the still active Wesla Whitfield who, despite taking a bullet and suffering paralysis from the waist-down following a botched robbery attempt, became most active as a performer and recording artist after her setback.<br /><br />A major difference between Melody and the other three mentioned singers is that thus far she has eschewed the \\"standards\\" (evergreens from the Great American Songbook composed by Berlin, Kern, Gershwin, Arlen, Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, Rodgers and Hammerstein/Hart, etc.)  which \\"jazz\\" singers have traditionally regarded as a kind of preliminary litmus test for admission to their art. Her repertory, consisting almost entirely of original material, is tuneful, personally touching, and well matched to her vocal strengths. Still it's questionable whether any of her recorded songs are strong enough to become \\"standards,\\" or to exhibit the staying power of, say, \\"Over the Rainbow,\\" one of the few standards she has recorded.<br /><br />In some respects, the classic status of the Harold Arlen tune is surprising, given the challenge the song presents to any singer who attempts it, from Judy Garland's celebrated version to the hundreds of interpretations that have followed it.  The first two notes of the song require that the vocalist travel upwards an entire octave (a sizable yet exacting leap from the first to the 2nd note).  In jazz it's long been an unwritten \\"rule\\" that even the best improvisers (Louis, Miles, Coltrane; Ella, Sarah, Roberta Gambarini) respect the composer's original melody for the first and last choruses (by contrast, everything that happens in between the \\"in\\" and \\"out\\" choruses depends upon the improvisatory inventiveness of the performer).  Melody begins the song by moving up a 3rd for the song's second note, coming up a 6th short of the octave interval in Harold Arlen's melody.  Moreover, in Gardot's version the song is given a quasi-minor modality and ends, finally, on an unresolved chord.<br /><br />Perhaps the changes are intended to reflect a less sanguine, more tentative and melancholic (and therefore more personal) view than the song's normally exhuberant, optimistic verses seem to call for.  Or perhaps the changes  merely reflect a better fit between the performer's vocal equipment and her material.  In either case, the performance, though faithful to Yip Harburg's words, transforms Arlen's original melody into a different song.n between the \\"in\\" and \\"out\\" choruses depends upon the improvisatory inventiveness of the performer).

B007J4T2G8|5.0|so many people i know have read this book and told me to read it as well. the book grabs you from the first page  and by the time the steamy verging on pornographic parts come in I was so hooked on the characters that I had to keep reading. It is a love story in every sense of the genre and when the book just ended I kept hitting next page next page and nothing, I had to find out what was next in these 2 peoples lives. Needless to say came right here and bought part 2. so enough sitting here typing this review I have a book to read
B004A8ZWWO|1.0|The real crime in this movie was that it was made. Not even the gag reel in the DVD extras is funny. Even for those that are looking for something silly and unpretentious, this movie will be a totally waste of time. They tried to be funny, crime, suspense and action and they ended up with nothing.<br /><br />Only one thing was interesting: Tea Leoni. She was cute.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|I've had two pairs and on both pairs, the ear cups broke off way too easily. The P21 were a much better headset than these and i would not recommend to buy them. They do offer great mic and sound quality, however it breaks literally after a month, they are just so fragile, it's unbelievable. I went with P11's after these and I'm way more satisfied with the P11s than the PX21s.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved all three books in this series.  The ending of this book was so wonderful....and showed the beginning of the story from a different point of view.  This series shows the beautiful love story which develops between these two characters.  The true love that they share is the dominant factor in all three books.  To the critics....it may not be a traditional hearts and flowers love story....but it is a love story nonetheless.  I enjoyed watching Christian Grey work through his issues under the constant nurturing of Anastasia.  Thank you so much for such a great weeks worth of reading!

B007J4T2G8|4.0|It was a good story. I like that it is part of a series.<br /><br />I did read the reviews before downloading and the verbage was on point in those reviews about the main character using the word \\"Crap\\" often. But I found it funny and reflective of the character's personality.<br /><br />Soemthing different than the Nicholas Sparks romance or vampire love stories. This was exciting and I wanted to keep reading to find out what would happen next.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I remember watching The Sound of Music in the theaters and I loved it. I would watch it again and again when it aired on television.<br /><br />When The Sound of Music 45th Anniversary Blu-ray/DVD product came out, I didn't really want to get it because of the steep price tag. When Amazon put it on sale for 70 percent off, I had to get it. I was glad I did.<br /><br />The bonus material alone on the second Blu-ray DVD made it worth the price. I only had a chance to watch the first bonus material, which explored aspects of the film including comparing stage to screen, the story behind the songs as well as the restoration process.<br /><br />As I write this, I haven't had a chance to watch the film but after looking at the restoration process, I can't wait.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the film, definitely get it.

B0026P40NU|2.0|This is unfortunately one brilliant example of a production that is completely, totally, utterly ruined by the soundtrack. It is not in anyway in concordance of the time period of the story and there is a constant underlying confusion between the language the characters speak, and the music which is more similar to a Teletubbies march than anything else. The characters remain shallow.--such as Dickens is completely a caricature, Aidan Turner as Gabriel Rossetti is more similar to a painfully handsome senior highschool production heart throb than a mid 19th century romantic painter, Hunt is barely coherent..., sadly, because my curiosity is now definitely peaked to learn more about these painters whose work I've always admired, but never been able to put into perspective.  But let me get back on the soundtrack: it is possibly the worst ever.(Well, maybe anything by Philip Glass is even more painful).<br />Excruciatingly handsome Turner is frequently in sexual situations, almost more time is spent without his shirt off than on. It is obvious, that a lot of the story was developed around this very marketable young new actor, but as a whole it just backfires. I\\"m glad I've now seen it. Next step, this will return to recycling to the next customer looking for background story to knit to.<br />Basically, what a bummer.....
B007IQX9ZW|1.0|This movie has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever watched.  Very disappointing, pointless, mean spirited and not even remotely entertaining.

B007VGXS8M|5.0|As advertised and runs smoothly on the Kindle. A little on the easy side andmore for kids, but definitely worth the 99 cents.
B007R41E8O|5.0|Honestly, most hidden object games leave a lot to be desired story wise, but this one is really engaging. The music and mini cut scenes really do a lot to enhance the mood of this game.  I highly recommend this game, especially if you're like me and hate waiting on hints to reload because you're stuck and really want to get back to the storyline.
B006OB3K56|2.0|While the actors were brilliant, the scenes themselves were too long and drawn out...almost to the point of making me want to get up for something to eat or drink.  Too slow-paced.<br /><br />In addition, I found a specific part or two to be a bit unrealistic.  I'm very close friends with a sex addict.  It's as if this film wants audiences to believe something tragic will cause pause in the sex addict's behavior.  I personally haven't found this to be the case whatsoever.<br /><br />Michael Fassbender and his member are marvelous in their roles, giving incredible performances...but this movie just doesn't live up to the hype.

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Downloaded this app because I enjoyed it on my ipod. This version has crashed on me continuously. It has locked me out 3 days at a time. visiting other towns does not work. On thenipodbversion you can earn free cash but not on the kindle version. This app is junk. it should never been released in this condition. One would think it would have been thoroughly tested before release. save yourself a headache and skip the DOWNLOAD!
0765365278|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I could not stop reading. It is not too long. This is why I read in the first place. I love every little bit of information and thought of the characters even if it doesn't move the plot along. Make the next book 2000 if it is as good as this one all the better. This book has a lot of moments where your just blown away. Long live BRIDGE 4.
B007I0JHM2|5.0|I'm surprised no one else has written a review on this great book.  The interweaving story lines, the rich characters, it's one of my favorites.  It transports you back in time, I can actually visualize the garden, the houses, the dress.  It's rich in detail but not overly done.  There are twists and turns I didn't see coming.  I wish the other two novels by Ms. Morton were on book tape, as that's how I \\"read\\" this one and really enjoyed<br />the reader.
0765350386|3.0|Ok i know it got great reviews and yes ill admit it was good but its almost like he wrote this book with one hand tied behind his back. All the pieces were in place, good magic, good character, and goo world but is just falls a little flat. It is like the lies of lock lamora but without the wit. This could have been great. The final battle was very good. I know he can write see my Way of kings review. I just wish he would just break into awesome.
B00377E5SG|4.0|This movie is  a favorite. It is  a remake and the way it is modernized really works. Harrison Ford plays a business-only focused guy who  really does not value his brother to be more than a boy who has never grown up and never will.  The story line is well paced, the scenery lovely and the ending predictable,but for those who like sweet romance with comedy and wonderful actors,  this is one to watch.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Love this production of Phantom!  We just got the DVD about 6 weeks ago, and my 13-year old daughter watches it at least once a week.  We were lucky enough to see Sierra while she was in the Las Vegas production.  Love that she's \\"made the big time\\".  No one deserves it more!

B007V2UGPE|4.0|at first I wasn't sure if the game would be fun b/c all u do is move the guy back &amp; forth. but there is strategy involved so there is a challenge.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|This movie is an amazing comeback for the muppets. It's great if you have always been a fan, are not familiar with the muppets, or want to introduce them to a new generation. It's witty and clever for adults, but silly enough for kids, and the music is the best.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This appears to be my first(oops, its my second one...) review on a book by a digital age writer - you know, those people who are publishing their story without a dedicated publisher's support (or approval).<br /><br />So, how to begin? First of all - there are five stories in there; and to my pleasant surprise all are somewhere between good and very good. One of them is absolutely mind-blowing, the best story I have read since 1982, and since that time I've read more than 1500 novels and countless short stories. So, trust me on that one: this collection is not only well worth the money and a good read but it also contains one true pinnacle of science fiction story-telling of the decade. And no, I won't tell which is it, so get it, read for yourself, judge for yourself.<br /><br />Hugh Howey's writing is excellent, he manages to get you hooked instantly into the story while leaving yourself enough room to make yourself at home in his stories until you are completely immersed in a background setting nobody in his right mind would really want to. It is, all things considered, counted and labeled, a dystopian world's image he is painting inside your skull. And he keeps surprising you, often you think 'OK, now I have figured it out.' until you realize you haven't. And heres the master at work: everytime you experiece such a surprise you have essentially fooled yourself somewhere along the story - Hugh never did hide anything in this story, but your mind hardly ever connects all the dots. That is, until you reach a plot point, something new is revealed to you and you are tempted to smack your head and say: \\"Sure. Obvious. I should have seen it.\\"<br /><br />You really should have, you know. Well, its probably that, while reading the stories, you are becoming part of the stories cultural background, sharing their knowledge about the world, their beliefs, their taboos. And that is where the magic lies .<br /><br />One more thing: Hugh promised to read every review and I dowonder how he keeps up with it. This seems to attract quite a lot of them...
B004W89N72|1.0|concept looked good but functionality is worthless. wasted money on this one.  Much of the text labeling fields is so tiny that I can't even read it.  It is not even User friendly. I am deleting it from my Kindle Fire.
0345803485|1.0|I was a bit skeptical when I bought this book...rightly so. The level of writing is not where it should be for a published novel. I swear I could have written this when I was in my teens. The characters are too far from reality and they by no way connect with the reader. Ana's recount of everything is also annoying, and honestly the sex is not that appealing. Everything is over the top like she is having a daydream, which we all now how absurd these are.<br />~I am indeed greatly disappointed and will stick to reading the works of real authors.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very nice to play the many games they have its nice that they are kindle fire acepted so yes im very happy eith these games
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|One of the Best book I've read and an emotional roller coaster ride. I cannot put it down and It's been stuck in my head after days of reading it. I can't wait for the continuation of this book. Great work Ms. Day!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|What a great series! I do hope that they will continue to bring out new versions and levels. Challenging and relaxing at the same time, encourages lateral thinking and creativity.
B004QX07G4|1.0|The short stories, some only one page, some only a paragraph, was a great disappointment.  I kept thinking more would follow, only to be left wondering.  I struggled to read 50% then finally gave up.  Big waste of my money.
B002ZG9774|5.0|This is a great musical Cher and Christine were outstanding singers.<br />Cher sang two songs and she has not lost her touch. Christine sang 7 songs<br />and was outstanding --what a voice. The story was also good I like happy endings<br />and this video has a happy ending.

B007IK44CK|1.0|This Mission Impossible was the nadir of the series. Previous installments had compelling action sequences, decent acting (see: the last one with Phillip Seymour Hoffman), and a dynamic, interesting story where the characters had at least limited interest.<br /><br />This one has none of these. It was even worse than the over-the-top John Woo-directed installment. Brad Byrd seemed as interested in getting laughs all the way through as in creating a compelling movie. Instead he creates a terrible cheese of a movie with cheap laughs and zero compelling elements.<br /><br />This movie is a joke. Don't waste your money.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its the best because. instead. of getting. boring on 1 game. u can hit back. and. got to another. instead. of u having. to. get off one app. to another

B0053TMP24|5.0|Rick Riordan's \\"Son of Neptune\\" was one of the most delightful books I read this past year.  I am now rereading it.I started reading it a granddaughter's house and found it so clever that I bought the Kindle version when I got home so I could finish it.  I'm also excited that the book is enabled to loan it to a friend.  That is the best thing about Kindle books, you can loan some of the books to friends who loan books to you.<br />I found the \\"Son of Neptune\\" to be very very clever.  Especially the part where the Amazons own and operate Amazon.com. The characters are all well-rounded, but Ella the Harpie is the most entertaining character in the book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I am in love with this game it is the best game I have play.I am never gonna delete this game.
B001FA0H3E|3.0|I have loved John Le Carre's books over the years.  This book is not his best, but it is a good read with glimpses of the Cold War era spy novels of his past.  It is great to see Le Carre use his extensive expertise about the Cold War in a novel that merges the demise of the Soviet Union with the rise of Islamic terrorism.  The book highlights the difficulty the intelligence community is having switching from fighting one type of enemy with a very different enemy and the tragic consequences of misunderstanding as old thinking is used when new thinking is required.  It is hard to teach old dogs new tricks.
B00634GHJA|5.0|I love this app it is so much easier to get my pictures onto my  kindle fire!!!!I really recomend this so awesome app
0061969656|4.0|This is the least interesting of the series so far.  It has all of the elements that you would expect but it doesn't move the story forward in any significant way.  The previous books really stand alone as novels; this one reads more like an episode.<br /><br />I think I can guess the reason for this.  When Cornwell wrote the Richard Sharpe series, he placed his protagonist at all of the pivotal moments of the Penninsular War but he arrived at Waterloo with no more war and a public that wanted more Sharpe books.  Like Forester's Hornblower series, he was able to go back and write about the younger Sharpe, but then he had to shoe-horn stories into the gaps between the earlier books.  My guess is that he swore never to put himself through that again and so the Saxon stories are going to plod along in strict chronological order rather than skip ahead to the more significant bits.<br /><br />Like all of this series, writing in the first person seems to tempt Cornwell to channel a little more of his own anti-Christian childhood feelings through the character which hurts the historical accuracy a bit.  But the careful re-creation of the political, military, and material conditions in Britain at the end of the ninth century, combined with really good storytelling make up for it.
0553801473|1.0|A very sad day indeed. Yet another writer going the way of the incredibly boring and long winded Robert Jordan. Even the descriptions are so Jordan like. Mr. Martin, please return to your original writing. i would much rather wait 5 years for another of your well written novels than to plough through a disaster such as A Dance with Dragons.The book was a terrible disappointment.

B00275EGWY|2.0|**1/4 Rating<br /><br />I watched this yesterday (finally) and wasn't expecting a 5 star masterpiece but was expecting about a 4 star riveting war movie. Needless to say I didn't get what I was expecting. The movie was *good* at all levels but nothing Oscar or major award worthy. To me the film looks like it was shot digitally which is fine if it would have added some \\"grittiness\\" to it or something. To me it just looked cheap. Honestly I never once really cared about any of the soldiers and that suprised me to. There was simply nothing for me here.<br /><br />As much as I thought Avatar was overrated as an Oscar contender for best picture, if I would have had a vote, I probably would have chosen it over this (and I can't believe I'm saying that). And while I thought the directing was realistic and solid, I defenitaly would have voted for Cameron as Best Director. The near to final season scene (w/ the suiside bomber) was ultra compelling and the sole reason I give it an extra 1/4 star. Overall....thumbs down

1401207529|3.0|I'm not a graphic novel aficionado by any means. I read a bunch of them as a kid and Batman has always been my favourite. Now that I'm all grown up and I make my money I thought it would be cool to add a few titles to my bookshelf. I bought this graphic novel because it was highly rated by critics but in reality it's a story you already know because of all the Batman media that has been released since this novel. In that sense it was probably game changing when it was released but because you already know the story it's really not as gripping as say Miller's Dark Knight Returns.<br /><br />Bottom Line: It's a good book to have as a collector but if you want entertainment you might be disappointed since it's too predictable for you. Evetually you would probably buy this one but if you are wondering if graphic novels are the thing for you look at some of the other Batman books first...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|best game of 2012 good job guys and girls that made this game<br />I play this game every day because its so much fun yall need to make some good army games though that will be really good keep it up

0345803485|5.0|I loved all three books. I could not take my nose out of these books. I read one then immediatly would start the next book. I loved that this book was so different from all the other romance books I have read and sure hope this author writes more of the same.<br />Yes, it had sooo......much sex and yes it was great for the first two books but there was alot of twists and turn along the way. I loved the variety of the sex scenes. WOW!!!! No I am not sex crazed. Just a working, mother, wife, and house wife who really enjoyed some spice in my life.<br />I loved the complex caracters and Christian Grey was amazing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not normally into erotic fiction. I wanted to give this book a try and am I forever regretful that I did. This story was not just BDSM. I actually fell in love with the story of Christian and Ana! I laughed out loud and cried. I say BRAVO EL JAMES! BRAVO!!!!!

Before I got my KF,  if it looked like it might rain, I used to have to wait for my PC to boot before I could  see weather radar.<br /><br />Now I turn on my KF and very quickly  have AccuWeather's radar tell me the location and trajectory of rain bands.
1935707590|5.0|I have been out of school for ten years and it feels like I have forgotten every single thing I learned in my math classes. I bought the OG Quant Review and became completely disheartened upon reviewing it. I tried the GMAT for Dummies, but I'm embarassed to say I found that a little overwhelming, too. (I feel like I need to point out my under-grad GPA was 3.8, so I'm far from being a dummy, but that is how I felt after not using math for ten years.) I then bought the Manhattan GMAT Foundations of Math and I am very pleased with it so far. The author says it's a comprehensive guide to help us remember all the things we once knew, but have since forgotten. This is EXACTLY what I needed. This book reviews the basics. It is not an in-depth study guide. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has been out of school for a number of years and feels overwhelmed at the thought of the quant section of the GMAT.
145470246X|5.0|I preordered this book several months before it was released and was quite excited to receive it in the mail a few days ago. I was not disappointed! The projects are phenomenal and Sabine's ability to explain in words and pictures how to do things like cubic right angle weave is nothing short of impressive. Sabine's use of color is amazing, too. She doesn't just use a single palette, but uses color combinations that would fit nearly every readers' personal styles. She encourages her readers to experiment, like she did, to come up with variations as the beads inspire them. Even if I wasn't going to make any of the projects (and I am!) the book has wonderful photos and a nice gallery of both Sabine's and other beaders' work at the back of the book. A 10 star book!

B004WKI204|5.0|This is the first of Tina Fey's books that I've read, and I am definitely ordering the others now. She is hilarious and intelligent....a rare combination. As soon as you read this book, you'll immediately want to watch every episode of 30 Rock and SNL with her in it. She's friggin' fantastic, and (realising a cliche becomes a cliche for a reason) and inspiration to young comedians everywhere.
B0059XTUVI|4.0|I was mesmerized by Meryl Streep's performance in this movie. Awestruck. So I see why she won the Oscar, as well as why her makeup man finally won it after thirty years at her side.  But the movie itself was choppy and frustrating to watch.  I gather that the filmmakers wanted to give the feeling of Thatcher's decline into dementia and her deep grief at the loss of her husband.  However, I don't think this film needed the extra help.  Meryl Streep's performance was extraordinary enough.  If the rest of the movie had been of better quality, this would have been a 10 star.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|In my opinion this is one of the greatest board games of all time.  If you like strategy or trading games, even slightly, you will love this game.  Buy it, you won't regret it.
B000024KZQ|5.0|The soundtrack to The Preacher's Wife allows the listener to hear a prodigy at her peak. The orchestrations are breathtaking, and Houston's nimble vocals rise to heavenly heights. All the songs that include the Georgia Mass Choir are roof-raising and lovely.<br /><br />My favorite track is \\"I Love the Lord.\\" Even though I'm not particularly religious, Houston's rendering of this song transcends earthly pain. Here, the orchestration rises to the level of Houston's vocals, although I think her performance of the song with a smaller band in the movie, The Preacher's Wife, is more tender because she sings using her head voice more often and she doesn't push her voice as much. Nevertheless, the recording on the soundtrack is equally moving.<br /><br />Since Ms. Houston passed, I have spent a lot of time studying her voice and her interpretation of the songs she's famous for singing. She was one of the twentieth century's greatest interpreters of songs with an incredible ability to improvise and perform callisthenic runs that remind me of great jazz musicians like Coltrane. Whitney Houston put all of herself into her songs; the type of talent she possessed comes around once in a lifetime, and I would encourage anyone to buy her recordings and listen to a master work.

B001U9BRNE|5.0|Having seen a portion of this concert on PBS, I knew it was filled with talented performers.  I was looking for a Blu-ray concert to celebrate my purchase of a new player.  My living room is fully equipped with all the speakers and amplification a sound man is expected to have.  I saw this product being offered on Amazon and read the reviews.  What others are saying is absolutely true!  The audio and video are superb in this concert.  The dts sound is excellent, I  have a powered sub and you'd swear the drummer is in the room!  A very worthy addition to anyone's collection, and it will appeal to just about any musical taste.  My girlfriend loved it too.  Buy it---you will love it!<br />DJ Chet-Buffalo
0385040253|5.0|I remember this book as an old friend of my childhood.I would sit by my grandpa's knee as he showed me how to tie a hitch or bend a line .,Then if I still couldn't get it he would hand over his worn copy and let me read for myself & study the drawings and ask questions.It's one of the fondest memories I have,And now to have my own copy of such a fine work as[[ASIN:0385040253 The Ashley Book of Knots]] I just so happy words aren't enough to express what this book means to me,I'll be 60 this year.

B000NY12LO|5.0|This was my first novel to read by this author.  I thought this book was amazing.  It did leave me wanting more information on some of the characters and I really wished the author would have gone more into some of the side stories going on.  The ending wrapped up kinda quickly and left me sort of at a loss after being so vested into these characters.  This story line is very real and can happen anywhere.  The way kids treat each other in school is appalling and we don't need to read a book about it to know this.  I will recommend this story to others for sure.
0670023329|5.0|If there is ever a hell on earth, it must be Camp 14- and other concentration camps in North Korea that are run in the same manner. I can't improve on the many reviews that go over the details of this book, but to me the very saddest part of this is that the countries with the most influence on North Korea- China and South Korea have little incentive to make changes in that country, especially in the ruling family. As the author points out, China likes the status quo, since NK acts as a buffer between them and South Korea, one of most dynamic, capitalistic countries in the world. On the other hand, South Korea is doing just fine and doesn't want to rock the boat with the North. They are even willing to give over tons of goods to keep the Kim dynasty going, while not saying a word about the Camps. In essence the only way for change to come about is for those in power- politicians- to read this book and others like it and become motivated to start holding the Korean Communists' feet to the fire. As the world becomes more aware of the camps and their utter brutality, perhaps change will come. However, as Shin himself fears, the North Koreans may simply kill off everyone and eradicate the evidence if it comes to that.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Ok I do not tend to read romance/erotica at all.  I just feel blah about it.  For some reason I had to see what all the fuss was about.  I was not prepared for how much sex there really was.  Most of this book is sex.  Honestly, it wore me out.  After I got past my own shock factor it was so repetitive that it got old.  I just wanted them to figure out what we all already saw about the relationship.  Anyway I will continue on with the next book in the series as I am dying to know what happens to this couple despite the fact that all they do is have sex.
0345803485|1.0|Okay, I caved and bought the book. To all the one and two star reviewers- I should have listened to you! I am about 150 pages in and am so tired of reading about Anastasia biting her lip and saying, \\"Holy Hell\\" ( it seems like it should be a \\"Gee! Willakers!\\" she is so naive). So many cliches( naked woman wearing a man's white button up shirt, eating grapes, cheese and french bread, the trusty butler and on and on). Christian is all over the map and inconsistent as a character no matter how \\"low his pants sit on his hips\\" and Ana is just not believable as a current university student. Yes,one can be an innocent, but good grief...Congrats to the author. I am sure she is raking in boatloads of money. But it will not be from writing a good book. It will be because of the titillation factor and curiosity of people like me who should have known better.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|pretty good. lots of different things to do. so far I don't think it forces you to have friends who play like other games.
B0002XMF5S|2.0|For anyone not familiar with the story of this records inception, I will give a quick recap to bring you up to speed.  This album was intended to be a solo album by Tony Iommi, however the record label insisted that the Black Sabbath name be used.  When viewed in that scope, clearly Tony had no intention of carrying over Black Sabbath sound in any capacity, nor was it his intent to sell records with the name recognition.  So let's divorce ourselves from the bias of the Black Sabbath cannon and attempt to understand what this album has to offer.<br /><br />\\"Seventh Star\\" is more of an attempt touch base on what you might consider the blues rock roots of Tony Iommi.  As for the vocals, enter Glenn Hughes, possibly the most \\"soulful\\" singer Iommi has worked with.  A man who was no stranger to the vision Iommi had on this album.  The real question I have to ask is this - Why isn't this album better?  The ingredients seem to be here, some polished blues riffs, dirty sounding bluesy leads, and a passionate frontman.  Sounds like I have done nothing but make an argument FOR this album.  Let's start with the positives.  The title track \\"Seventh Star\\" has attained legendary status for me.  Whether viewed solely on it's own merits, or within the larger scope of Iommi's work as a whole, it stands as one of my all time favorite cuts in and outside of Black Sabbath.  \\"Heart Like A Wheel\\" is a blues rock dirge, with some tasty guitar leads.  It has a sinister plodding feel, that is, sinister in a bluesy, hard rock way.  Even the upbeat bouncing \\"Turn To Stone\\" deserves a spin, despite it's somewhat cheesy nature.  And now THERE is the segue ladies and gentleman.  The cheese on this album is too much for me personally to take.  Just listen to the 1-2 punch \\"In For the Kill\\" and \\"No Stranger to Love\\".  Almost wrecks my ability to listen to the album.  How about \\"Danger Zone\\", a song that sounds like it's riff was stolen from Poison or Motley Crue.  I'd say listen to this album for yourself and find your own hidden gems, I found mine.  However, I can't heap praises onto something that I myself only have found a small handful of songs to enjoy.  Two Stars.  Buy it and find out for yourself.yourself and find your own hidden gems, I found mine.

B000JML7YC|4.0|Old English novels, especially by Bronte sisters, I find fascinating.  It is not just the language itself, but the cultural context of life as it was so long ago.  The contrast to life today  as concerns the lack of decorum, civility and manners, are food for thought.

B005OKTPKC|3.0|I did enjoy the book, however it was a little predictable and I was disappointed that he seemed to run out of ideas and suddenly rushed to conclude the book.  I would have liked him to go into more detail between wining the money for a particular case (I wont spoil it by saying which case) and him finally going into practice on his own.  Ok ... but a little shallow.
0553801473|2.0|The book is well-written, and if you like the rest of the series, you will like this. It still only deserves 1 or 2 stars in my opinion for 2 reasons:<br />1) Too many characters that died (or seemed to) in the previous books come magically back to life. This Deus ex Machina will not help the plot. In real life, we deal with dead people and the problems the deaths left behind. The first books did that. This book tells us that they weren't really dead -- it was a deception. Blech.<br />2)Martin pulls a Robert Jordan and creates new points of view that extend the plot rather than wrapping up plot threads. We want an ending to the series, even if it makes us sad to see it wrapped up.<br /><br />I also found it confusing to read, because even though I know it takes place concurrent with the previous novel, it was hard to mentally go back to \\"before this happened.\\" I will have to get both converted to text, then rearrange all the chapters of both books chronologically to get a better picture.<br /><br />My request as a reader: Let the dead stay dead. Minimize the points of view. Write the end of the series now, and then write everything that happens between Dance and the end. But make sure the end is written -- if you die, at least we'll have a satisfying ending to a wonderful literary banquet.

B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great app. No problems except for how addicting it is! I would highly recommend this to anyone.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this app! I have played it almost non-stop since I downloaded it this morning! Can't put it down! Fun easy. game!
B00634GHJA|5.0|it transfers photos and videos fast I really enjoy using it. the only thing I didn't like was that you need to go to your computer before you start sending pics or vids.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|My 8 year old loves playing this game on the fire. Challenging and fun for all ages. Great graphics as well.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I have an 08 Mercedes which played but did not charge my iPhone 4 and my iPod nano 5th generation.  After adding the cable jive adapter, I am now able to play and charge.  Simple fix.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I got this game for my 8 year old son, he loves it. I haven't noticed any problems and like others, there is no issue getting out of the game if you just click on &quot;stuff&quot;.
0741470314|5.0|I think that this book is really insightful on Michael Jackson's life. I did not know a lot about him until I read this book. I can now consider myself a fan. He was a true musical genius as well as a great humanitarian who tried to make the world a better place. I can honestly say that this book tries to show the readers what people did not see on television. It is a true look into Michael Jackson's personal life. I feel that after reading this book, I understand him more as a person and entertainer then ever before. Defending a King is a great book to read anytime. The author lets you escape into Michael Jackson's world like never before. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I thought this movie was one of the greatest animated films that i have ever seen and i know for sure that im buying this dvd. I cried at the ending and laughed at the rest :) its a must get!

B0063IH60K|4.0|Just started playing and I enjoy it already! Its very easy to play and the graphics are easy to see.
B005LAIGPU|5.0|I went into this movie not really sure what to expect, but I go to a ton of movies and this one looked like it might have potential. It was great.  I left the theatre pleasantly surprised. The acting was good, the story was done well and the action sequences were as good as any big budget action movie that have come out recently.<br />This is one that I will own.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Most of the games are really fun and keep you from boredom. I really recommend it! Probably not for young children though. The games can be challenging.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|This amazing film holds up unbelievable well.  I found myself drawn into the movie as if it were in the theatres now.<br /><br />The transfer is bight and crisp.  This was Crawford at her dead level best.  The other side of this  disc is a complete documentary of her life.  I mean a complete documentary it's worth....well, it worth more than the movie itself if that's possible.<br /><br />If you are a serious collector of movies this has to be in your collection... It is a must ! !
B00634GHJA|1.0|You have to be at your computer to type in a web address whether receiving or sending photos which is pointless. I would just connect my cable at that point. Waste of time.
B007SSDS24|2.0|This movie was only ok.  It does not have an ending!!! leaves you hanging and wondering why they would make a movie that is unresolved.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my kids love playing this game and they enjoy building their own cities. this is a great game and it is also free.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I don't get why it has to download and people are stupid I can get our of it and I'm 9
0385344228|5.0|I \\"read\\" this book on CD, and looked forward to my commute.The characters in this book are recognizable but not transparent. The plotting veers from courtroom, to community, to the inner obsessive loops and unimaginable fears of its characters.The legal details are accurate but not technical. I have recommended this book to my friends,  and passed my CDs around to my co-workers. We all agree it is the absolute ultimate pageturner.
B006ZEDZNY|5.0|A big commercial flop, this intelligent comedy was dismissed by the critics and ignored by the public, and yet I must say that I quite enjoyed it. It is based on a novel of the same name by the late journalist Hunter Thompson. Johhny Depp stars as Paul Kemp, an alter ego of  Thompson (Depp had already played a character based on Thompson in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas).<br /><br />Set in 1960, as the movie begins we see Kemp arriving in Puerto Rico in an alcoholic haze. After an interview with Lotterman, its editor, Kemp gets a job in an English language newspaper there that has seen better days. Kemp becomes pal with two other alcoholic reporters in the paper, the crazy Moberg and the cynical Sala. These three are soon living together in a decrepit house in San Juan and are involved in a series of humorous adventures. The closest thing this movie has to a regular plot is when Kemp is contacted by Sanderson, an enigmatic businessman (Aaron Eckhart, who is great). Sanderson introduces Kemp to various businessmen and politicians and wants to recruit him to write a puff job in the paper so that an island that serves as practice range for the military would be available for the construction of hotels. Sanderson has a very pretty girlfriend, Chenault (Amber Heard), who soon tries to seduce Kemp. Kemp eventually wants to write about the various corrupt plots he learns in the newspaper, but he is vetted the very cynical Lotterman, who doesn't want to rock the place, and instead thinks the newspaper should do soft pieces.<br /><br />I'm not telling anything more about the movie, but it makes for a pretty entertaining film. It's intriguing to me that this film was not well received, perhaps for some it has too broad a style for a comedy, given the subject matter. The great recreation of the era certainly helps.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|As others have noted, this game has a glitch in it where at some point your timing on objects goes bonkers and resets to 172 hours or more rather than the actual timer that it was supposed to be set at. Until that happens, the game is very fun and addicting.<br /><br />Things that could be improved:<br />The timing glitch.<br />The ability to rotate buildings so they don't face funny directions.<br />A better way to exit the game.
B00785P2QC|3.0|fun but ran out money and need credits. time is not on your side. great game though like the idea of the game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|entertaining for all age ranges. my 7 year old enjoys it as well as myself.  have to be quick catch Scrat, tho.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is really fun I played cityville and all the other crapville but this game is nothing like them another good thing about this game is its free I vote five out of five
1594202710|4.0|As a Chinese, the name \\"Kissigner\\" has been familiar to me ever since high school years. He has long been labeled as \\"the old friend of China\\". So when this name is associated with a book titled \\"On China\\". I assumed it to be extraordinary and couldn't wait to order it. It seems I did the right thing as I constantly found myself so focused when reading this book on commuter train that I missed my stop.<br /><br />I found this in one of the previous comments; \\"When you read a book like this, you will have a better understanding of China than 98% of the people living in China and 95% of the Chinese people living in America.\\" That's probably too exaggerating a statement that Kissinger himself would be reluctant to make. A more realistic way to put it would be \\"If you read this book, you will have a better understanding of China than 95% of the people living in America\\" I think that's closer to Kissinger's goal for writing this book - to facilitate a better understanding of China as a large, old and singular country, the history and development of Sino-US relation, and its possible directions in the next decades. By reading this book and some of the readers' comments, I'd say that purpose has been successfully fulfilled.<br /><br />Chapter 1 -3  History<br /><br />No resource on China could be deemed completed without exploring its history, especially in the past 200 years. The first three chapters is an attempt in that regard, Dr. Kissinger took his time to fashion a somewhat ambitious but at times superficial analysis of China's 4000-year history. Here he makes a few points that will be repeatedly referenced in later chapters, for example, the application of Sun Tzu's \\"Art of War\\" in Mao's strategy, and Chinese leaders' aloofness and self-reliance represented in the emperor's dealing with the Macartney envoy in 1790s, and later found in Mao's and Deng's negotiations with the Americans. Kissinger does a satisfactory job here in helping western readers form a historic view of China. The only thing missing is probably the period from the fall of Qing dynasty in 1912 to the founding of the People's Republic in 1949, which had a deep impact on the historical view and emotional feeling of Chinese, but be treated by the author with merely a few paragraphs. Even though the book is \\"On China\\", it's actually on US-China relation. The 1912-1949 period is probably not that significant in setting the stage.<br /><br />Chapter 4-11 The Mao era<br /><br />One of the Amazon comments says \\"Kissinger is in awe of Mao Zedong\\" so his analysis of Mao is intrinsically biased.  I'm not sure if that is true, but Kinsinger's assessment of Mao is surprisingly close to that of many contemporary Chinese (including me), whether they have personally experienced the cultural revolution or not. After all, this is the one that made China united again after decades of weakness, shame and torture. If you understand how important the founding of Israel is to Jews, you'll understand how important the founding of the People's Republic is to Chinese. In China we say \\"Mao made Chinese stand up, and Deng made Chinese stand rich\\". It is likely that during the process of US-China rapprochement, it was crucial for Kissinger as the key player to appreciate the Chinese interlocutors' decision making process. Even though Kissinger does not endorse the continuous revolution that Mao promoted, he might have moved closer to a Mao-sympathizer when building personal relationships with Mao and Zhou. Particularly, the authors writes, \\"In some sixty years of public life, I have encountered no more compelling figure than Zhou Enlai\\". This seems to be in line with the vprevelant Chinese view that Zhou has been the most respected premier and diplomat, probably the most respected politician in the history of the People's Republic of China at all, even more so than Mao.<br /><br />No wonder that the author devoted about half of the book to this topic as personal admiration was compoundedby the significance of Mao's decision in recreating the landscape of Sino-US relation and even the balance of power in cold war. Many of the events described are not new to people who grew up in China. They may be revealing to American readers. What I found instructive is the author's justification of American's entry into the Korean War as well as it's commitment to defending Taiwan. In communist propaganda both were characterized as imperial intrusion, which led to direct military confrontation between China and the US. Now that I read these chapters, I started to understand that the American decisions were somewhat based on America's perception of the practice of democracy and its policy to contain communist expansion in Asia. As the author put it - both sides are right.<br /><br />I agree with the view that using the traditional Weiqi game (originated in China) to explain national strategy is a great simplification, which the author seems to enjoy doing. If sending American troops to Korea and sending the 7th Fleet to the Taiwan Strait were both Weiqi stones to contain China, then what about Soviet Union deploying misses in Cuba? This is not really about Weiqi.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Accuweather is User friendly, accurate, and complete.  Loads quickly, too.  I like to have it on the. Road with me.
0345803485|4.0|I found the book intriguing. I enjoyed reading it. I don't think it will end up on any school reading lists or become a classic piece of literature but sometimes its enough for a book to just be fun. If you don't expect a book to change your life you'll probably enjoy this.
B0055SWM08|5.0|awesome game! great to sit down and play and easy to pick up any time. very easy to spend an hour or so playing! just wish it would have been longer...I look forward to more quell!
B007MNV5WU|4.0|I love the game but on the iphone version there's the  danger zone world.  Please update to danger zone but still a very fun game.
B007FXLZ9K|1.0|The movie streamed from Amazon just like many others I have rented, but no sound or image, so it is hard to write an accurate review. :-/
B007V2UGPE|5.0|it rocks people it really rocks I really recommend it come on people get it it is awesome. really awesome. no kidding
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|...especially the syncing function across platforms. Now my PC, my iPhone, and my Kindle Fire all automatically hold the same set of notes.
B005Q1W0ZQ|3.0|The series is good but we recieved an US region disc 3 (even though it say UK edition). Amazon where good and sent us another set but that had exactly the same problem (discs 1 & 2 worked fine as where UK disc 3 didn't work as said US region - neither work on my PC either which has a region free player).<br /><br />Gave up and will wait for to be on sale at the shops.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! There was so much suspense, and a twisting plot that kept me interested. Being a teenager, this book is exactly the type of book I need. There is a ton of action and fighting, with a little bit of romance to spice things up. Definitely had a memorable ending! Only took me 2 days to read, and its only been 6 days since, and I have finished the 4th book in the series. I'm hooked!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I liked all three books in the trilogy, but this was my least favorite of the three.  Unlike many others, I liked the ending, even though it was a bit sad.  However, it just kept getting stretched to a hard reality to accept.  Don't get me wrong, I love imagination and a fictional story, though I guess it just strayed a little too far from the first book's parameters.  Still good, and still recommended.
B0000X61VE|5.0|I received this product in great condition.  It was still in an unopened package.  I have already used this video many times.  Thank you very much!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I loooooooove this app but I finished it the day I got it.<br />please Update! until then, I will try to beat my high scores.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really like this app because I watched the movie and I also really liked the movie so I would really reckomend this app expecialy since is free
B0069UV0LS|5.0|I just watched this movie for the first time On Demand on my tv last night, and it was a very powerful, disturbing movie.  In fact this movie, along with Take Shelter, another independent movie are two of the best movies I've seen this year.<br /><br />Tyrannosaur is a movie full of anger and redemption, and it did not disappoint.  The acting, screenwriting and directing of this movie, not to mention the soundtrack were all A+.  The story of a man so beaten down by his own anger at himself and the world, and an abused charity-shop worker mesh together in a way that left me thinking about this movie for hours.<br /><br />I just had to come on amazon and give a review before purchasing this.  I don't want to give any spoilers, but if you, like me, appreciate stories of the human condition and the spirit of redemption, you must watch this. Another keeper.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it is a fun game that has a lot of tasks that keeps you active. the energy refilled quickly so there isn't too much waiting ame who doesn't love Oregon trail hunting
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|Maybe I'm weird.  I think it's an awesome movie and my son and I prefer it.  Please keep making new Cars movies!
B00634GHJA|5.0|Absolutely awesome app. Works on my Kindle Fire and my HTC Evo. Would recommend it to anyone who takes a lot of pics on their phone.
B00338QENI|5.0|There's nothing new I can say about this book.  It's excellent; well-written, entertaining, while being informative.  Normally, a \\"science\\" type book would not get my attention, but this one surely did!
B007R41E8O|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game and I wish there were more out there like it.  love the length, storyline, and difficulty.  also liked how you could zoom in on objects and the hint option.  looking for more like this ONE!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|great time killer senseless violence rules.  easy game play. you can beat most lvls without buying the extras with real money
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's a great app to pass the time with once you unlock a few of the games. I give it four stars.
1416955070|5.0|City of Bones is the first book to an amazing series. I cannot recommend these books highly enough! Cassandra Clare is such a brilliant world-builder and writer, I will gladly read anything she writes. I love that there is a bit of everything in these books, all the myriad mythical creatures. I will be laughing out loud one minute and biting my nails the next! I would recommend these books especially for fans of Urban Fantasy, and YA.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|thankful to purchase of kindle, my daughter is able to access this game  when we are moving about making errands. she is five and it is very entertaining for her. have , tried it as well and cross several levels in the game, reminds me of the original super mario bros game minus the characters
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great app.  use it on my kindle fire smartphone and laptop to keep my world organized very customizable and User friendly.  highly reccomend.  have not tried other evernote products but hear good. things as well
B00634GHJA|4.0|Easy to use, and does what it says it does.  Even better if you didn't have to type the URL into the device you are trying to transfer photos to.  I was able to copy the URL to my Android's clipboard and paste it into a GMail message, which I then sent to my laptop, but I had to restart the transfer program again before I could actually receive the photos (got a 404).<br /><br />This should be relatively simple to fix with the addition of a \\"Share\\" or \\"Send URL\\" button (or even just a long press context menu item).  Other than that, it's a nice little utility.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Like most series, this book hasn't lived up to the quality of its predecessors. I found the book was good but it didn't have the same effect on me that made me not able to put the book down. That was definitely the case with The Hunger Games and Mockingjay.  It was a good book but just not the best in the series. It did have high expectations to live up to though.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Loved this book.  I purchased it in November and just read it in two days, and wished that I had not waited this long to read it.  i also wished that I could erase my memory of it - and read it again - except I want to keep the memory of this book in my head.<br />I recommend this to any video game fan and/or anyone who was born in the 70's.  Great book!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I enjoy this game. it plays wonderful on kindle fire! I cant put it down&hellip;i would say I'm hooked on this game!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Finished it one day!  You can't put it down.  It is as compelling as Christian's \\"dark side\\".  The characters are flawed, the dialogue is witty and the settings a masterful escape from reality.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love puzzle games and this really hits the spot. Love the calm music and rainy background. Plus there are tons of puzzles to solve
B007V2UGPE|5.0|pretty great, gets hard fast so runn as close as possible and slowly back up. one of the best free apps available
B000KIPT30|5.0|I bought this amp to simply attach to my headphones attached to my tv. I wear hearing aids and have never been able to hear all the words spoken whether it was a show or movie. But lo and behold, with this little amp I can turn up the volume louder than even I need. And I am using only one of 4 channels. If you are hard of hearing as I am, I definitely recommend this little jewel. Its made of metal so it's constructed well. It sure has changed my world!
B00634GHJA|1.0|this app sucks everytime you want to send something there's always a new url and it can never find the device you wanted to send the picture too.
B002GZQYMA|5.0|It was a gift for my son's friend in Russia. They were happy both). But it takes more than 30 days to get there(((
B007SYWFRM|5.0|soooooo amazing y'all really need to try. it out super super super fun rated 5 stars. that its so much fun
B00634GHJA|2.0|this works Ok.  If you really want to transfer photos from your phone to you computer then use dropbox.  you can also transfer anything else you want including video,  documents,  anything. that's on your phone.  And you can access it on any of the computers you use.  I don't work for them but am an avid user of dropbox,  simply a better choice
B003L20IFQ|1.0|Worst Movie Ever Made...Seriously a guy in a box for an hour and a half with the worst possible outcome!!! The crap that happened in this movie to this poor guy was unbearable. I'm surprised Ryan Reynolds even accepted this role. I will admit that his acting wasn't bad...I give him the star, considering he was literally the Only One in the movie. Talk about low budget flick, one guy, pine box, a lighter, a cell phone, a pen, a glow stick and a flask oh yeah don't forget the sand. Not even believable that the cell phone would even get reception down there in the middle if the Iraqi desert!!! Ridiculous they could have to least made it somewhat interesting showing some flashback scenes as to how he got there and some footage of the people on the other end of the phone line.  I'm shocked at the number of decent reviews this movie got!!! We kept fast forwarding through the monotonous scenes figuring it had to get better but no luck, we had thought the movie would have somehow redeemed itself by the end but it certainly didn't . Please don't waste your time or money on this one seriously not even worth $1 to Redbox it....not kidding!! You'll thank me later,  don't say I didn't warn you!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game for kids. better than the original.  cant stop playing need more energy quick lose sleep over this game
B0055SWM08|5.0|Good variety of play. Interesting challenges. No clock to rush you. If you like spacial logic puzzles, you'll have a lot of fun with this game!
B00634GHJA|3.0|A year or two ago, this would have been a very useful app. Today, Dropbox, Google Plus, and other free apps have automatic photo uploading built in, so there is no need for a dedicated app to do this. At 4.9MB, this app consumes a lot of your phone's resources for little functionality.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|glad I got the game cuz it is a ton of fun. I like playing this game a lot of the time. great game for all ages, mostly little kids.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game makes you think and use the strategic moves to complete the game. I like the way it makes you use your thinking powers, but is fun and relaxing.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitaire is solitaire; there is not much one can do to screw it up. What is nice about this one is the ability to personalize the deck and background using one's own graphics.
B004T5R2HQ|1.0|The version on Google Play is 1.3.3, the version on Amazon is 1.1.1. Why?<br /><br />Do not bother downloading this great app here. Get it from Google.<br /><br />1 Star reflects the fact the developer has abandoned the Amazon store without notice.
0061726834|5.0|For I while I've wondered about why so many people loved Delirium. It didn't particularly appeal to me and the description never sounded that interesting. I finally caved and had to see for myself what exactly everyone was talking about. Shortly into the book, I understood. It's not the quite the story that's amazing but it's the writing. It's beautiful and so remarkably well crafted that I can hear English teachers and librarians across the country giving thanks to Lauren Oliver for writing a young adult novel of this caliber. I seriously think the writing in this novel should be studied.<br /><br />In a nutshell, love is illegal in Oliver's dystopian society.  Love, also known as delirium, is considered a disease and all citizens must undergo surgery to cure them for the delirium by the age of 18. Lena, the main character, is almost 18 and is looking forward to the day she is cured.  The argument against love is that it is the cause of many of the worlds problems. \\"It kills you both when you have it and when you don't.\\" Rebels are imprisoned, killed, and beaten by the enforcers of the law. It's hard to imagine our society ever banning love but Oliver makes her world is believable and surprisingly realistic. Even as I describe this book I don't feel like I'm doing it much justice.  I assure you there is more to Delirium than what I've described.<br /><br />One of the things I enjoyed about Delirium was the way the author describes love.  Yes it is a book about love, but Oliver clearly paints the positives and negative sides. She describes both sides so well that you root for the rebels and understand why love is banned and law is so forcefully upheld.  For most of the book, Lena, is just discovering love. She is happy when she is with Alex, constantly smiling and laughing; and when she is away she feels the pain of missing him.  Their secret love keeps them living in fear of being discovered.  As Lena treads deeper into love, she begins to see the flaws in her society and how meaningless life is without love.  People who have been cured seem to be without a soul and the society Lena once found comfort in, becomes a future she cannot bear without Alex.<br /><br />Overall, I finally see what everyone is talking about it. It's a wonderful yet painful love story. You could say the Delirium has taken over me and now that it's over it hurts.  Upon finishing Delirium, I immediately bought the second book in the series and 20 minutes later I listening to Pandemonium. It ends on such a cliffhanger that I couldn't wait to find what happened next.ety and how meaningless life is without love.

B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I liked it a lot at first till my timers got messed up. it takes like four days to collect anything

0440241413|3.0|This is my second Sophie Kinsella book to read (the first being [[ASIN:0440241901 Can You Keep a Secret?]]?) I have had Confessions for a few years now, just sitting on my shelf collecting dust, and I kept saying \\"I'll pick it up soon.\\" Years ticked by I've moved a few times since then and I'm just now finished reading it. I do admit to watching the movie first, but it's been years..the movie came out in 2009 and I watched it when it was new. So it's been 3 years or so. I don't remember much of the movie, so it didn't weigh too heavily on my view of the book. Except it wasn't all together like the book. The book was entertaining, but being a Texan I don't quite know the significance of all the shops that are mentioned. I had never heard of most of the stores that were mentioned, so some of the story was lost on me. Yes, I get the main gist of the story, girl is a crazy shopper, I get that, I LOVE to shop, I love ordering something online and opening up the box and it's like Christmas. I can empathize with the character in this story, even if I don't totally know all of the places she's going.<br /><br />I think the writing is fine, it had some cute funny moments, but Becky was kind of dense. It took awhile for me to like her, and then it was me kind of tolerating her. I think she's a relatable character and all, I mean who doesn't want to throw out their bills and pretend they never got them, but we know that doesn't work in real life. I don't know though, this book was kind of hard to get into, I think I'll try out the next book, because this is such a popular series, maybe the next one is better. It's popular for a reason....right?
145470246X|5.0|Sabine always creates such beautiful pieces. Her directions are fantastic! I have made so many of the pieces on her site and cannot wait to get started with the book. I usually use 'post-its' to mark the pages of the projects that interest me. With this book, I would have to mark every page! Great job Sabine!!!

0545265355|5.0|I read all three books within the same week, they were absolutely amazing! I couldn't put it down! I think it will be a while before I find other books as good as these. I now cannot wait to reread the entire trilogy! If you haven't read them, it is a must!

0553386794|4.0|This book is exciting, imaginative and well written.  I suggest watching thevTV series after reading the book.  I see this having a cult  following.  Makes for great conversation as the TV series has make the book even more popular.
B007SSEBCU|5.0|Can't imagine why Amazon viewers haven't given it 5 stars. This movie is excellent. There are no other words for it except maybe magnificent...superb...Oscar worthy...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its a great game. very addicting. I spend all of my free time playing this game. I would defintaly recamend it. I love how easy it is to play.
0375704027|5.0|I was so sad to finish this book.  Reading it felt like a breath of fresh air, as if I was transported into a meditative beautiful world.  I did not want it to end.  I was riveted by every character's story and how effortlessly  Murakami was able to expose their essence.  The descriptions were so vivid and the characters so compelling.  This is not a book to be rushed.  Every person in this book was flawed in such a a sympathetic way that I was drawn to all of them.  I borrowed this book from the library but plan to buy a copy to keep for myself.
B00634GHJA|5.0|Very easy to use. You don't have to be extremely tech savvy to use the program. It is a great way to move photos.
B001ECQ4AS|4.0|I was a big fan of both The X-Files and Buffy, The Vampire Slayer. When they both went off the air, I was heartbroken. After renting the first disc of Season 1 of Supernatural, I knew I had to own the series for my dvd library! What a great show! Smart writing, great acting, excellent photography, and awesome special effects make this show a winner! I don't know why I never watched Supernatural until now -has it really been on the air since 2006?- but I'm glad I discovered it! A must for Fantasy/Sci-Fi/Horror fans!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i &lt;3 this game....so much! this game is actally like the movie exspt u can conroll it....not the people who created this movie/game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|As a fan of dystopian fiction, I hesitated reading Hunger Games, thinking a YA book would lack the hard edge that is an important part of the genre. However, I found the Hunger Games to be an excellent book, a real page turner. And it had plenty of violence and edginess. The story moved quickly and the characters were compelling. Like any dystopian story, the government is screwed up and the book presents that idea very well without hitting the reader over the head with it. I strongly recommend the Hunger Games to anyone who has not been drawn into reading it yet. Also, if Hunger Games whets your appetite for dystopian fiction, I suggest \\"American Epitaph\\" by James Laabs which is a much more adult story but a really great, thought provoking book.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is super addicting and it is AWESOME and I rock at it. THIS GAME PWNS AND ALSO I HOPE SAMARAI WINS
B004EPZ03O|5.0|The product was just how I wanted it and was right on time!! Thanks! The movie was also hilarious. I've always loved the muppets and this was epic!

1451648537|5.0|I have just finished reading the Steve Jobs book.  The book is an amazing and well written story of someone who was an undeniable genius.  Prior to reading the Isaacson book, I thought that I would dislike Steve Jobs as a human being once I finished reading the account of his life.  However, there is no way to dislike someone who did it \\"his way\\" and made it work.  The account of Jobs' successes and failures kept me glued to the story.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|awesome, creative, and fun. This game is the thing you do when you have free time. It reminds me of when I was a little kid and used to watch the movies. this game is awesome and I recommend it.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game<br />the game is a lot of fun and provides a lot of different activities.  waiting for energy is annoying but not unbearable.
B00634GHJA|3.0|I use Dropbox and WiFi Explorer Pro interchangeably for the exact same function. Why? Because it doesn't just limit my file sharing capabilities to just photos with the same functionality as this app. Try one of those instead. If all you need is photos however, it doesn't hurt to grab this while it's free.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is good to play inyour free time and is very fun.  Many people complain about having a hard time closing the game, just tap Stuff and then Options and the bbar on the bottom pops up.

1849514003|5.0|This book is a wonderful addition to any IOS Game Developers library, it contains many useful recipes (my favourite one being in the extra chapter you email the author to get - real time multiplayer!).<br /><br />The book is well written, the code is explained in a nice straightforward manner and is of a high quality. The writing style isn't boring or overly 'waffley'. This book now has a permanent position in my library, and I can see myself referring to it many times for the foreseeable future. You won't be disappointed with your purchase.
B003A03RRU|5.0|First of all, I love Sir Arthur Conan Doyle!!  I can't believe that his writing blends so well with the 21st century.  He was an extraordinary writer!<br /><br />Now, onto the Kindle book...there seems to be a lot of spelling mistakes in it - which is very distracting to read.  The stories themselves are fantastic.  Very clever how Conan Doyle puts his humour into it.  Nice to be interactive with a story once in a while.  It's not your run-of-the-mill-off-the-shelf-book.<br /><br />Buy it.  You won't regret it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a wonderful tool to help your walk with God. the audio is so handy to use while your cooking or wotking on a progect just turn it on and listen to the word
B00634GHJA|5.0|I haven't actually sent pictures to my computer yet, but I'll update this review when I do. For now, I've installed the app and looked at the features. It seems to be well thought out and very simple to use. I'm sure it will be useful.

B0013ND30W|5.0|I have had this blu-ray for over 3 years now and I have come to love this movie a lot.  This movie is filled with many compelling characters and a well-developed story that makes you want to watch it over and over again.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some of the games are pointless and boring. ok game to play if you are looking to kill time. overall, it's ok.
1595141979|5.0|If you have read the other 2 books and didn't really like them then trust me give this one a chance! I completed this one in about 3 days because it was just THAT good. I was hooked on every word. This is the book that made me believe in this series!
B0067Q42BY|1.0|I would recommend against this app.  I have an app manager installed and discovered that quite frequently this app is running itself in the background when I have not opened it.  What is it doing in the background when I've not opened it?!  It is eating up RAM on my device to do who knows what when I'm not paying attention.  No other game app does this that I can tell.  I am usually skeptical of reviews that complain about permissions and what-not, but this app seems suspicious to me or at the very least buggy if it is not malicious.
B000FIUPA2|5.0|I purchased the SACD of this album and the case was broken during shipping.  However, I did listen to it and it was phenomenal (as I said in that disc's review).  I sent it back for a refund because of the broken case and instead got this DVD-Audio used from E-Ba y.  This DVD-Audio is just as good as the SACD with regards to sound quality - full, rich sound from all 6 speakers, with excellent mixing, crystal clarity, and overall beautiful sound.  I will say though - for those who may be looking at buying this high resolution disc for the first time and are pondering whether to go with the SACD or the DVD-Audio, I would recommend the DVD-Audio (if found at the same price) because of the lyrics/narrative pics/video that come with the DVD-Audio.  It's the exact same sound with both, so why not get the extras (pics/music video of the song New Frontier/lyrics for every song) that come with the DVD-Audio?  However, it appears on Amazon that you can NOT get the DVD-Audio now brand new for less than $90 presently, but are able to get the SACD brand new for $50.  I don't think the DVD-Audio is worth twice the price.  You might wanna check Ebay for the DVD-Audio and maybe get it for $50 or less?  I got mine for $48 in very good condition and am very happy.  Highly recommend this album in high resolution 5.1 surround sound on both DVD-Audio and SACD.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Plays great. Have played 20 games and seen no ads yet. And you can't beat the price! Highly recommended. I even win occasionally.

If I had wanted to read a soap opera I would have found one on some network on cable.  I want a refund, and some one owes me about three weeks of reading time.  Save yourself, read something more satisfying... like a comic book...<br /><br />That is what this is... A Soap Opera with swords.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book did not live up to its hype for me at all.  My top three reasons:<br />1.  The sex scenes were not good enough to distract from the terrible writing, including no actual plot and countless typos<br />2.  Ana's character was so annoying that I wanted to spank her myself<br />3.  Knowing there are two books following this one is painful (bad pun intended)<br />I will definitely not spend another dollar on this series!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is just like the one everyone uses on the computer. I like that I can customize the background and deck using pictures from my Kindle.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I really enjoyed the first season of Downton Abbey which I watched online.  When I attempted to watch the second season, I had serious problems with video quality and stoppage.  ANNOYING!!<br />I decided to purchase the second season.  It was GREAT.  No problems at all and I didn't have to depend on the quality of my wireless connection.<br />I think I will go back and purchase the first season so that I will have the complete set.  Amazon had the best price on the dvds!!

B000WGWQG8|5.0|I have to say when I saw first saw the trailer for the HBO series, \\"John Adams\\" starring Paul Giamatti in the title role, I had some serious doubts as to whether or not I even wanted to see it. As an actor, Giamatti seemed to leave much to be desired if anything could be inferred by some of the minor parts he played in some incredibly abysmal examples of movies, such as: Howard Stern's Private Parts, My Best Friend's Wedding, and Big Momma's House.<br /><br />But in spite of his subpar resume, it turns out Giamatti CAN act. Giamatti creates an Adams who is as filled with self-doubt as he is patriotic fervor and the result is a believable, palpably human founding father who was as ambitious as he was flawed. The series begins on the evening of the Boston Massacre in 1770 and ends with the death of Adams in 1826- a span of some 56 years--which in and of itself is no small acting challenge but one that Giamatti manages to pull off rather convincingly.<br /><br />Laura Linney plays the forward-thinking, Abigail Adams, who was the intellectual equal and shrewd advisor of her famous husband. Linney is wonderful in the role. She readily conveys a character who is warm and God-fearing, yet possessed by unwavering Yankee pragmatism with a moral compass that seemingly never loses sight of its own personal North Star. Linney's effortless performance is a pleasure to watch and she easily captivates the viewer in much the same way that Abigail Adams charms the French naval officers, George Washington, Benjamin Rush and Thomas Jefferson.<br /><br />The series is superbly adapted from David McCullough's Pulitzer Prize-winning biography by the same title. Tom Hooper directs the series and does an exceptional job of it.  Unlike the heavy-handed direction that often typifies modern films, Hooper adroitly trusts the viewer to draw his/her own conclusions about various scenes or contentious situations, such as the frivolous French court's tepid reception of the bellicose, impatient Adams who is severely out of place as the American ambassador to France.<br /><br />Stephen Dillane is extremely well cast as Thomas Jefferson, who is as elegant-sounding as he is to look at; Tom Wilkinson plays a transparently self-promoting Benjamin Franklin who is seemingly unwilling to back American independence, or any patriotic cause, unless there is something in it for him; and Sarah Polley gives a poignant performance as the brave Nabby Adams who endues an unhappy marriage and then dies young, after undergoing a mastectomy with a minimal amount of laudanum as anesthetic.<br /><br />History buffs will enjoy the series which deftly combines historic fact with flesh and blood characters that are multi-faceted and compelling to watch.  Hooper's intimate direction easily draws the viewer into the respective scenes and helps the audience understand that the early days of American history were, in many ways, not much different than the stormy political climate in which we currently live in the present day; except that our founding fathers cared deeply about democracy and our current politicians do not.
0545265355|5.0|Amazingingly written! Short concise sentences. Every sentence meaningful. Usually I skip details... But with Hunger Games I didn't want to skip. Every sentence was precisely giving valid details.i
0345803507|4.0|This is the most plot-driven and least sex-driven of the Fifty Shades books, but that shouldn't disappoint fans of the first two. It's nice that the author wanted to leave the reader with a sense of closure, but it almost feels a little too perfect at the end (even for a romance novel!). I almost wish she had left some loose ends with the hope there might be another novel (she does, however, give the reader a tease of the story from Christian's perspective). I'm more than a little sad it's over, but I have a feeling this will be one series I will read again someday.
0393965953|5.0|nothing to complain about. the book came within a week and before school started. for a paperback book it was surprisingly new.
0345803493|4.0|After reading the first book in the series, I immediately started this one. I was not disappointed. I LOVE the relationship between Christian and Ana and the tension continues in Book 2. The only thing I would criticize is that it was a bit long and the last half over-packed with melodrama. One crisis would be dealt with only to have a new even more unbelievable one pop up the next day. I'm hoping the third book returns to the original focus of the relationship between Christian and Ana, but based on how book 2 ended, it doesn't seem likely.
0345803485|4.0|Due to all the talk about this trilogy, I had to get it and see for myself what all the hype was about. It started out slow for my taste, but soon picked up speed. Ana annoyed me a bit with her repetitive dialogue and constant self talk, but the sexual details made up for it!  The description of Christian left me speechless and his \\"hobbies\\" were HOT! I thought the sex scenes were discreetly  and subtlety sexy. Everything Christian said and did, as well as the way he looked at Ana, made my heart beat a bit faster. I totally got into their relationship and I found myself wanting their relationship to work. I read this 500+ page book in two nights......I had to force myself to put it down and go to sleep. Already have the next two books in the trilogy ordered.  Loved it!
6305633177|5.0|I read the reviews before buying this DVD and I feared that the sound was going to be bad, but no, it is good, as soon as the image, this DVD is a good sample of the years of the best songs and the best line-up of Metallica.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am immensely drawn to the characters and the complete trilogy. I enjoy BDSM erotic stories and I enjoyed how each book connects with the other the to weave the exotic tale of both the charismatic  Anatasia Sreele and the enigmatic Christian Grey. I would recommend this trilogy. I read the entire trilogy in 4 days, shifting from my kindle app on my cell phone during boring meetings to my kindle app on my iPad at home. Deliciously wicked, well done E.L. James!

B005MYEQ4U|4.0|Woody Allen has always given me mixed emotions possibly because he is so prolific.  I'll go on record and say that \\"Annie Hall\\" is the most overrated film of all time.  When he's brilliant he produces great work like \\"Manhattan\\", \\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\\" and \\"Mighty Aphrodite\\".  When he indulges himself you get \\"Celebrity\\" and \\"Melinda and Melinda\\".  \\"Midnight in Paris\\" is neither great or self-indulgent.  It's a nice little fantasy with a message which is the time you have foisted on you is the best of times.  Allen is careful not to beat the message into the ground.  Allen makes Paris as sumptuous and exciting as he did in prior films for his beloved New York.  Owen Wilson as a scriptwriter who dreams of being a novelist does admirable work.  He serves as a kind of a surrogate of Allen's but he doesn't make the mistake of trying to impersonate him.  The weak link is probably the portrayal of the historic figures Wilson's Gil meets in his foray to the past who are little more than wax figures.  It's a bit of a shock becuase they are portrayed by an array of good actors.  Regardless, the buzz this film created isn't from it being inherently great but from it's appeal to a mass audience as well as Allen's normal afficienadoes.

B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Last season after 20 years in the doldroms the Pittsburgh Pirates with a collection of little knowns on their roster found themselves in first place in the National League Central Division shortly after the All Star Break.  I was rooting for them to succeed except at the expense of my beloved Phillies.  Alas the dream was not to be as the Bucs wilted in the heat of the pennant race.  While their success lasted it was good for baseball.  Whether you are a large market team or small you break from spring training with the intention of winning the whole ball of wax.  If you are a Kansas City Royals fan you don't want to be told that your team doesn't have a chance from Jump Street.  As the baseball adage goes a season is a marathon not a sprint.  \\"Moneyball\\" starts after the 2001 campaign where the Oakland A's fall short in the American League Championship Series.  The small market A's are losing their star players for greener pastures and paychecks.  General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) asks the owner of the A's for more money to attract suitable replacements.  The money is not forthcoming.  Beane, not willing to throw in the towel, decides to think outside the box.  With the assistance of Yale economist Peter Brandt (Jonah Hill) they reconstruct the team with modestly priced players who compliment each other.  Is this fluorish enough to win the World Series?  Baseball fans already know the answer and novices would be behooved to find out.  The thing I admire most about \\"Moneyball\\" is it's affinity for our national pastime.  Sure the film has it's share of aracana and statistics but it gets everything right from the crack of the bat to the calls to sportstalk radio.  Pitt is charismatic as the wheeler-dealer Beane.  You believe he can charm a decent utility player from another team for one of his skirt chasing headaches.  Hill is every geeks dream.  He gets to play fantasy baseball with the Real McCoy!  Philip Seymour Hoffman is effectively taciturn as manager ArtHowe who has to sink or swim with the machinations of Beane.  There has been much debate whether this is the greatest baseball film of all time.  That would be unfair to \\"Moneyball\\" or \\"Field of Dreams\\" or \\"Pride of the Yankees\\".  They are all quite different films that have baseball as a subtext.  As a fan of forty years it's impossible for me to say if the movie is accessible to non-fans.  Regardless, \\"Moneyball\\" hits a grand slam.
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|I purchased this after having read the first instalment of the Clifton  Chronicals a while back I had been anxiously awaiting the continuing story.  I started reading right away and I was not disappointed  until I came to the end and saw that there was once more a sequel and I would again have to wait for the full story to evolve hope it comes soon .  Jeffrey archer still has what it takes making him a master story teller.  I am eagerly waiting the next instalment of the Clifton Chronicles as it is a wonderful story of which much needs to be told.
0345803485|1.0|Ok, So, I was hearing all this stuff about Fifty Shades of Grey.  Oh, how wonderful and sexy the book was!  OMG!!! How HOT and erotic it was. So when a friend of my college age daughter lent her a copy, I picked it up and started reading it. And OMG!  How awful this book is!  I really didn't know much about it...and I found myself thinking...\\"I've read this before someplace...\\" (And I don't mean in the Story of O).  And then I realized...this was nothing but a badly written remake of Twilight.  So, I went online and did a bit of research, and found out that the book began as Twilight fan fiction.  And really \\"E.L. James\\" stole so much of Twilight I think Stephenie Meyer should sue.  Geez, \\"Breathe, Ana\\". Ana biting her lip, (Which I don't remember that much from the Twilight book sage, but which was done to death by Kristen Stewart in the movie franchise)...Christian saving Ana from a cyclist, her not being able to look at Christian without almost passing out...Holy Crap! as Ana says almost every three sentences...it's Twilight without the sparkly vampire...and the BDSM seems to be thrown in there to give the book a bit of a spark...which it doesn't. I read the Story of O, which is a much better book...if you want an erotic BDSM experience, read that. Don't try to slog through this boring piece of pseudo-Twilight idiocy.
1416583432|3.0|Who doesn't want to know what their dog thinks about and how he see's the world? This was my thought when I first picked up this book. I wanted to know the answers. What I got was much different and less than I hoped. This book attempts to answer that question though scientific experiments. While much of the information is interesting (natural selection changing dog behavior over time because we bread dogs that have qualities we like) some was downright \\"we don't have an answer we like so let's insert a hypothesis as fact\\". Many of the reviewers prior to me have pointed some out but some that stuck in my craw were:<br /><br />Dogs behave heroically by accident or by random chance: I disagree wholeheartedly. We had a Lab/Pitbull mix we one day introduced to the ocean. Once he got accustomed to it, I ran into the water to play with him. When I laid down in the surf next to him, he grabbed me around the upper-arm with his teeth and firmly pulled me toward the shore. This wasn't a random act of protecting his food source. He thought he was protecting me. Another example would be when I was a child. I had wondered from home and our German Sheppard followed me. While I was only about a block from home, the German Sheppard would not let anyone near me until my parents came. Again, this wasn't a random heroic act. This was protection as he saw it.<br /><br />Dogs don't know right from wrong other than by human interaction: Again using personal experience, we currently have two dogs. When something happens in the house while we are at work (poop, pee, ripping up something they shouldn't), only one of our dogs greets us at the door. The other was hiding. Obviously when I first open the door, I don't know a thing. Another example was again years ago. We had A Great Dane up in years who had trouble controlling his bladder. We'd know he had an accident when we came and he didn't greet us. Instead, he was hiding in a closet.<br /><br />To me, must of this hyperbole this is akin to the \\"Humans like rocking chairs because it reminds them of the womb\\" hypothesis I find so amusing. Trying to narrow cause/effect into simple experiments or conclusions leaves so many variables on the table as to render the experiment useless and often wrong.<br /><br />Overall I found the book informative, but it had a lot of holes that were filled with trite reasoning and explanation. If someone had never met a dog, this book would be a bad introduction and it would leave the person completely unprepared for the mind of our beloved canines.

B004L49K20|5.0|A few years ago I totally rediscovered Duran Duran. It was because of their cover of \\"Whitelines \\" I had a hard time finding the album ( thank you ). The point is that Duran Duran reinvented themselves which is difficult for a band that size. I've grown past the old albums and only own a best of from them. Other reviews state that it's Duran Duran how they were in the beginning. That's only half true. The quality is high as it was in the beginning. The music however is NEW and fresh. They might aswell have taken a new name for the band and call this one a great debut.
B00634GHJA|4.0|greetings fellow amazonians I just got back from my weekend with the doublemint twins (see doubletake review to catch up) and did you know they were like sixty years old? boy was that a shocker for me because they sent me a picture and it must have been thirty years old because there is no way that these were the same women. anyway we still had a great weekend and I took a lot of pictures (and not all of them were dirty) so I downloaded the photo transfer app so I could send my pictures to all of my devices. that way I can show all my family, friends, co-workers and perfect strangers that sit next to me on the bus what kind of weekend I had. my only gripe is that the name is to bland couldn't it have been snapbucket or photofish or something like that? thanks amazon for giving me an app that will help me show the doublemint twins off
B0019NB9A2|5.0|\\"Forbidden Planet\\" will always be the best and most influential science fiction film of its era, the 1950s.  This movie is the direct ancestor of \\"Star Trek\\" and everything else that followed, such as \\"Star Wars\\".  A Blu-ray featurette explains that Gene Roddenberry, \\"Star Trek\\" creator, was trying, in part, to transform \\"Forbidden Planet\\" into a TV series.  Comments from famous directors and special effects wizards express their debt to the film, admiration of this achievement, over half a century after it appeared.<br /><br />Great technicolor in \\"Forbidden Planet\\" with standard definition DVD, yet even better on Blu-ray in High Definition.  Blu-ray is like discovering a whole new planet.<br /><br />Thus, Amazon should divide customer reviews of DVDs and Blu-rays into those two separate categories: \\"DVDs In Standard Definition\\", and \\"DVDs In Blu-Ray High Definition\\".<br /><br />In the Blu-ray column, it would then be extremely helpful for Amazon to carefully identify, describe and distinguish between multiple Blu-ray versions.  This is already a mess with \\"No Country For Old Men\\", and \\"Titanic\\" might be even worse.  What I suggest for Blu-rays is entirely impossible as to standard definition DVDs, with their countless different releases.<br /><br />Back on the \\"Forbidden Planet\\" Blu-ray home page, we get Editorial Reviews of a 2-disc standard definition DVD.  That confused me, since the Blu-ray is only available in a 1-disc version.  Amazon ought to only describe and review the Blu-ray on this page.  I believe Product Details refer to the Blu-ray, but hard to be absolutely certain.  In that best case, Amazon leaves us with Product Details that contradict Editorial Reviews, highly undesirable.<br /><br />If someone from Amazon reads this review, I do hope my suggestions will at least be considered.  They are easy to implement, especially when any brand new Blu-ray first comes on the market.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|When I ordered this I expected that we would enjoy it but I never figured it would be this wonderful.<br /><br />The cartooning is great fun, and there are salutes to some earlier films in the characterizations, as well as there being the signature Disney flying light (this time with fireflies).  The sinuous curves of the dancing minstrels within the detailed architectural background early on make it obvious that the film is going to be visual joy, and that promise is kept.<br /><br />But what is best are the messages, both subtle and overt and the truly fun way they are imparted.  The movie allows the environment to often be much larger than the main characters like in real life, a feature too sadly often lacking in children's films.  Yet, at the same time it delivers the hope that kids need and desire, but by teaching how to make the real world work for them:  by knowing the difference between needs and desires, and being willing to work for dreams.<br /><br />As the Stones sang, \\"You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometime you just just might find, you get what you need.\\"  This film says much the same thing in a very different way and for a very different age bracket, and it does so beautifully.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I have never been into the lovey-dovey, romantic stuff, but Wuthering Heights is just amazing. It's a classic and always will be an amazing story. The story just grabs your attention and never lets go. One of my absolute favorite quotes is from this book. It's a shame they don't make books like they did back then. \\"If all else perished, and he remained, I should still continue to be; and if all else remained, and he was annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger.\\"
1594202842|4.0|The way a book is, a lot depends on the way it is written.  Amy Chua has written a fantastic book and has kept the contents riveting till the end.  Forget the contents, but the way a book is written is so important, because that keeps you hooked to the book.  If the writing fails, then you'll end up with the book being a fantastic sedative.<br /><br />In today's competitive world, Amy Chua shows how important it is to keep your kids on their toes.  If not, with today's distractions, it is so easy to lose focus and end up as a nobody.  I have always wondered about this.  Will I allow my kids to do whatever they want in their lives? Is that appropriate? Or, will I be defining their paths? Both have their pros and cons.  But, I think it will be better to define the paths of the kids, and take them through to the end point of success.  Amy Chua does all this and more than possible to ensure that their kids have the best of everything.  I read that her boot stirred a lot of controversies over the way she has raised her kids.  But, I totally agree with what she has done, because, I am sure, some day, her kids will understand what she has done for them and thank her for her commitment.  If she hadn't done that, I am sure, her kids would have spent 90% of their time on social networking sites on the internet.  Some people may call it as freedom, but it's an absolute waste of time, and totally irresponsible of the parents if they cannot channelize their children's time in the right direction.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I belong to the Chua's school of thought.  If a child has to be raised a certain way, the parent has to do all the work, even at the cost of being unpopular with the child.  It is only the end that matters, and in the end, the children will surely be proud of their success.<br /><br />It's a fine book, and I think every parent should read this book.
B00371QQ34|5.0|There are plenty of opinions about the movie.  Personally, The Jackal is one of my favorites that gets popped into the player at least once a year.<br /><br />Movie opinion aside though, the Blu-ray transfer of the movie is outstanding; crisp, sharp, and beautifully color-balanced.  The DTS sound is full and nicely directional through a 5.1 surround-sound system.  To enjoy a favorite movie is one thing, but the visual and auditory experience of The Jackal Blu-ray just adds to the pleasure.<br /><br />BTW, often Blu-ray/DVD combos come with two discs; not this one.  It is a double sided disc with the Blu-ray on one side and the DVD on the other.  If you're experiencing your 6th decade of fun (or more) on this planet like me, grab your readers and a magnifying glass to check the center label to see which side you're playing.

B000002AD0|5.0|I am not a big Santana fan. I just have not been exposed to their albums and such. But I am fascinated with live shows that have a magical energy in the performance and the energy between the audience and performers. No band does this with every recording. The fire comes and goes, shrinks and grows. Now then, this is one of my top 5 all time live recordings and I am a huge fan of live recordings of Hendrix and Zeppelin. I loved this album from the first time I heard it a couple of years ago. Lately, I find myself in rough times and listening to this joyous album more. I CAN'T STOP PLAYING THIS DOUBLE ALBUM! It keeps me feeling energized and positive through some stressful times.<br /><br />This performance is like an electric church psychedelic revival. The songs themselves are great but are played with great virtuosity and a lot of passion. The energy crackles and sparks from beginning to end. It has refinement and sophistication yet it charges forth like unbridled horses. It soothes like a cool river, takes us through exhilarating rapids, rapid bends and magnificent cascades.<br /><br />I wish this recording was 78 hours longer!

B000N6U0E2|3.0|This starts out as a nice story about a single dad with incredible effort and talent who goes from nothing to owning his own brokerage firm in S.F. Will Smith and his young son's performance are excellent, but the plot has been tinkered with to the point that its not believable (too many sudden roadblocks), and becomes overly heart-tearing.

0449227421|1.0|ughh - since I wasted two weeks of my pre-sleep bedtime reading time,<br />the least I could do was waste another five minutes writing this short<br />review.  I can't believe I didn't put this book down after the first<br />50 pages! ughh.  This was my first (and last) foray into Ken Follett's works.<br />  I thought this was written by a fifteen year old.<br />Characters acted stupid, reacted stupidly, and the cliches throughout<br />this book are laughable.  Again, I can't believe I read this or that<br />this book was even published.<br />  I read 15 minutes of a new Steven King novel  to \\"wash\\" all the<br />memories of this one away.

B007V2UGPE|4.0|a great game for zombie loving gamers who want to shot and slash zombies with there own minions in the samurai world
1469984202|4.0|I admit to being somewhat biased against indie authors, but compilations like this are changing my mind. I found the book to be well realized, immersive, and well-paced. I like a good dystopia and found this well thought out and a real page turner. I ended up caring about the characters and felt that they were well drawn. I have now purchased more of Mr. Howey's work, and I look forward to his future stories as well. It isn't often that I find a new author whose work I want to follow; I'm pleased that I took a chance on this book! I recommend this for science fiction fans who enjoy suspenseful stories.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love the game. honestly!!!! but do u wanna know why there r so many five star ratings? that's right! to get more level ups and coins! it is rediculous!! right? other than that its awesome!! crazy girl out! :)

B004KKX80A|5.0|I'm 35, I have a seven year old son who recently has become a Bey Blade freak!  Talking about it non-stop, watched like 50 straight episodes on Netflix.  So he got some money for Easter and wanted another Bey.  I had to up the ante b/c of course, that's what I do.  So I told him we could probably find some better stuff online, knowing nothing about Bey Blades, other than the fact that I loved Battle Tops as a kid.<br /><br />So my son wanted L-Drago, so I ordered him the Meteo LDrago.  Of course, I'm not going to get beat down, so I got this Big Bang Pegasus for me b/c it looked cool.  This thing ROCKS!  It's great looking, high quality, and makes the Bey Blades you buy at Toys R Us look like they came out of a happy meal.  This thing destroys all standard Beys that we've put against it, except for the Meteo LDrago, which has a left spin so it ties this bey every time almost.  It has multiple set ups, so you can adjust it to fit your opponent a bit.<br /><br />These things are the real deal, Japanese import.  Boxes are in Japanese, and they're cool as Heck!  If you're looking for a Bey, this is the one to get, and be confident that these Tomy Takara Bey's are destroying the coolest thing you're getting in the States, for just a few dollars more.
0780619951|5.0|Although I favor the original 1933 version with Charles Laughton as Dr. Moreau, this remake, with Marlon Brando has such a weird, off-beat treating of the story, that it makes it quite unique, and intriuging to watch. And the creatures are top-notch (thanks to Stan Winston)! I recommend this movie for anyone seeking an \\"unusual\\" experience! John Christman, Pa.
B006OV7RQ4|1.0|This movie was so boring. i thought that the story was good but it could of been played better. the only thing i could say about this movie that i liked was that it was realistic. that stuff happens. but all in all the movie was slow and boring. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend that you don't
B003R0MEZ4|1.0|I ordered Criminal Minds Season 6 on DVD and the are glitches throughout the DVDs.  I haven't been through all of them, but I've missed enough information to ruin the episodes for us.  I even went out and bought a new DVD player, thinking that might be the problem and I wasted several hundred dollars to do that.  I am very dissatisfied and I want a refund.  Also, the DVDs were out of order, so this tells me that the set was NOT new, as promised, but rather, it was used.  I'm very upset by this because I have always been a good customer of Amazon.  I'm not sure if I will ever order anything off of Amazon again.  This is the third problem I've had in less than three months.

Do treat your women well & be kind to them for they are your partners & committed helpers.<br /><br />also found in hadiths :<br /><br />Abu Hurairah (RA) reported: Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said:<br />\\"Take my advice with regard to women: Act kindly towards women, for they were created from a rib, and the most crooked part of a rib is its uppermost.

B007HJ84ZK|3.0|Though I have enjoyed the series, I am not impressed with the video quality of standard streaming.  I know it's not HD, but I didn't expect some of the graininess and blur.
B0073U2FB2|2.0|The movie \\"The Darkest Hour\\" is a new movie on an old subject.  Aliens come down to take over the world and get beat.<br /><br />The acting was good and not as fake as other movies on the same subject.  I watched it through Amazon Instant Videos but did not buy the DVD or Blueray.<br /><br />I know there will be some people who will have a better opinion on this movie but it was not one that I would want to have around all the time.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|I came across this movie while looking through the Amazon Instant Movies.  I watched it and was amazed on how good it was.<br /><br />It is not a fast action movie but one that told a story about a woman who had to fight to do what she believed was right.  In a time when women were not supposed to have opinions about government, Thatcher had to prove that she was the right person to be elected to Parliment.<br /><br />Meryl Streep (a very good actor in her own right) did an excellent job of protraying Margret Thatcher.  The way her makeup was done, she looked so much like Margret Thatcher.<br /><br />The movie shows how she came from humble biginnings and how she became one of the most power woman (other than the Queen) in Britian.  It also shows how she had to fight the male dominated establishment and won.

B006OB3K56|4.0|This is a gripping and terrifyingly sad movie. I have never felt so sorry for two people than I did for this brother and sister. The pain in their lives was all over every movement, word and action taken. SPOILER***What I found interesting was his co-worker was the one human being he couldn't have sex with. I think it's because he connected with her on a human level, not just sexual. The day before, he had tossed out all the crap of the porno stuff, even his laptop. I think he wanted to relate to her on a meaningful level. When she kissed him, she sexualized herself, causing him to go back into his addictive behavior, except this time, he couldn't get it up. So he goes on an insane feeding frenzy. The sister, what became of her I wondered afterwards...We can see that Michael, was still struggling. The married woman who in the beginning fought her desire, in the end caved into her animalistic urges as well. This film seemed to say that noone can control themselves, and this soceity is a sex mad, orgy. What a sad, sad thought...
B00076ZZ9I|5.0|I purchased this dual disc, in hopes it would be a HI RES 24/96, unfortunately it is just 16/48. However I must say while not a HI RES recording this is still worth the $10 as it is the best sounding AC/DC recordings I have heard. The sound is very polished and clean sounding, like no other AC/DC recordings I have heard!!
B003QNXPUK|1.0|This is a VERY expensive screen protector that is poorly manufactured. The shield I received was not properly cut so it ripped and had jagged edges in some areas. It's also very thick so it doesn't work well with most cases.<br /><br />On the plus side it does offer good protection and decent optical clarity. I like the feel, though I like the smooth feel of other screen protectors better. Installation is not too hard, but plan to leave your phone turned off for 24 hours to let everything dry. (That's right! You're going to get your phone wet in order to install this.)<br /><br />Good luck with customer service. I contacted them immediately about the manufacturing defect, but didn't hear back until I contacted them again two months later. By then their 45 day guarantee had expired so I was stuck with the \\"lifetime warranty\\". Lifetime warranty means you pay Zagg another $4, plus shipping to send your old protector back to them each time you need a replacement.<br /><br />Compare that to Viewguard: $0.99 + $1-$2 shipping. Viewguard uses a protective sheet on the top surface of the protector which makes it very easy to install. It seems to me that given Zagg's steep entry price and very expensive lifetime warranty you'll be ahead no matter which less expensive protector you choose.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|One of my favorites. I especially like the sleep function that allows me to set the radio to play for 30 minutes or so while I fall to sleep. Recording is great too.
B0059DOJGY|5.0|I am NOT a big Edguy fan. Age of the Joker (AotJ) was the 4th CD from these guys that I purchased. AotJ has 2 CDs which makes this a great deal. The previous CDs that I own are \\"Theater of Salvation\\", \\"The Savage Poetry\\" and \\"Mandrake\\". AotJ is my favorite release of these 4. Edguy has matured very nicely since Mandrake.<br /><br />I knew Edguy in the late 90's with the release of their CD: \\"Vain Glory Opera\\", and immediately recognized the lead vocalist, Tobias Sammet as a force to be reckoned with. But I did not drop down the cash to invest in the band at that time. Instead of jumping in, I waited for the next release hoping to see the band's progress and lead singer, Tobias' progress. I invested in the next release of Edguy: \\"Theater of Salvation\\", followed by the 2000 release of \\"The Savage Poetry\\". Then in 2001, I purchased \\"Mandrake\\" and an Avantasia CD: \\"The Metal Opera\\". I thought these were OK, but not enough listening satisfaction for me to get motivated to write about them...I don't write reviews unless I feel the CD is worth at least a 6.0 out of 10 (10 being the best of prog metal from bands like Rush, DT, FW, SX, etc).<br /><br />With this latest CD set, I got motivated to write. I scored AotJ as 8.2...after only 1 listen, which is saying a lot. The vocals are solid throughout the tracks, even on the Quiet Riot cover. After 5 more listens, I reconsidered my position and changed my score to 9.1. I like all the tracks on both CDs except the last track on CD 1.<br /><br />Based on the reviews about \\"Hellfire Club\\", in comparing to AotJ, I decided to shell out the funds to purchase the HfC CD. When it arrived, I began to compare to AotJ and weigh in how I think it compares to AotJ. I score HfC a 7.1 out of 10. Tracks 1, 5, 7 and 11 are solid tunes on par with AotJ. Tracks 2, 3, 4, 8 and 9 aren't bad, but different from the quality of songs on AotJ. In conclusion, there is little comparison. AofJ is far more complex, mature, diverse styles and entertainingcompared to HfC. Just listen to Tracks 3 and 4 on AotJ and you will understand that AotJ is Edguy's best album.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|definitely recommended:) I downloaded this primarily to create reading lists for my kindle fire since the fire doesn't let you make collections like other kindles do. and I really like clipping out information I need instead of typing everything into a note myself.

0439023521|4.0|This is book 1 in the trilogy. Around when the movie came out a few of us at work decided that we really did have to read the trilogy, so one of us went and got the first book and I have just now ordered the rest of the books. I gave actually ordered all of them now. Just Friday was I able to get the first from my coworker, after two others. On to the review now.<br /><br />The United States is now, made of up districts, each with their specialty and each controlled by rulers in the Capital. In order to remind the districts of the control they have each year the Capital draws the a name of one boy and girl from each of the districts and forces them into an arena for a fight to the death.<br /><br />Katniss has supported her family since her Father died a few years ago. In order to do that she has learned to be mentally strong and to hunt or forage so she can keep food on the table. Now, she must use all of her knowledge to stay alive in the arena. In the arena is Peeta, also from District 12, like Katniss and they have a history together that neither of them can forget. But, are unsure on how to let that effect them in the games. Then there is other Tributes from the other Districts to deal with too, and though she is suppose to kill them and Katniess isn't sure how she feels about that.<br /><br />As you can tell from the fact that I got the book on Friday and finished it today I couldn't put it down. It is a YA book and truthfully I am not sure what age it is for and am not really sure that it is something I would have been allowed to read as a youth. But, I think there are great themes in the plot that I hope parents would talk to their children about as they read it. There are themes that are just scratched here in the first book in the trilogy and I look forward to seeing how they are dealt with in the next book. Mostly the political stuff, it is presented but needs expanded on.<br /><br />This book concentrates on the arena and what happens there with the characters developing who they are and making choices in how the arena effects them. Hard decisions are made by all of the characters and seeing how they deal with the decisions adds to the dimensions of the plot.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to others, giving it 4 stars, but when it comes to YA, I would suggest the parents read it first and be prepared to talk about things especially if the kid is under 15.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the game is ok it just takes a while to get points but other than that its a pretty good game.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this based on the strong reviews and I was not disappointed.  It was easy to get lost in the plot and not put the book down.  Overall, a great story at a great value.  There are so many well written reviews I won't try to add detail....frankly, I just wanted to leave this well-deserved 5 star review ranking.
B00785P2QC|2.0|just your average facebook type game.  it needs a bigger lot size also.  wouldn't pay to play it, glad it was free.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am a women in my late 50s but when I heard so much about this book I felt that I needed to read it to find out what it was about.  The movie ads just seemed like the story was so violent and I did not want any part of it!  I called my sons girlfriend because she reads everything, and she said \\"yes, all the books are great, she went directly from the Hunger Games to the next and the next book.  So, I purchased the book online for my Ipad and started reading.  It starts out good and continues to the end.  She was right, I downloaded that second book as soon as I finished the first.  I did not think the books were violent, as we see worse on TV.  I'm told the movie does the book justice and I do plan on seeing it soon.  I'm now reading the Monkingjay, the third book of the series and it still has me hooked!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app. it even has a reminder alarm so you don't forget to read your Bible that day.  Also., it allows you to see the verses in many different Bible versions so you can get a complete feel of what God wants you to know.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|they only thing keeping this from a 5 rating is the 'need' to buy tokens to speed up or release levels.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This case is sturdy and snaps on nicely, it never seems to want to slip off. At the same time, it is easy to remove. The best part is that it's sleek, I hate bulky covers. This still easily slides into my jacket pockets, even some of my jean pockets when I need my hands free. It also looks really nice, I am not a fan of bulkier leather cases. The prop up feature works just fine on sturdy surfaces, not so well on beds though ( but easily possible if you're careful). The inside of the front cover is a soft touch felt like material. I like that it wipes off finger prints from the screen in between uses, I don't like that it also collects lint and dirt when you set it down places. But it is easy to remove with the same lint removers I use for clothes. I am very satisfied with my case, and have not come across another case I would rather own.
B007MLDC2I|1.0|The movie itself was awesome but I could not get the movie to stream properly to my tv. It took almost the 24 hours to get the thing to download properly. Yay for direct connection to my 10 Mbps router..
B00457WZEI|5.0|Fantastic story. I loved it! Held my attention throughout. With the movie coming out I wanted to make sure I read the book first and it was well worth it. I enjoyed the book even more than the movie. Highly recommended!!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|...so much fun, but it just has too many bugs. Shops suddenly needing 400 hours to produce; houses, animals stating Ready! but you cannot collect from them.  Makes an enjoyable game really frustrating
B000YH6YG8|5.0|I highly recommend this movie to everyone! Great acting and a great story.  I hope everyone else can enjoy the movie as much as I did.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think it is great!!!!! I really like it. it is really good for kids. it is really cool and I geaus wonderful
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Im very impressed with the purchase I made of The Hunger games. I purchased this title on my Kindle Fire. Within mintues I received it. Im very pleased with both my Fire and the book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it's nice to have the word of God with me all the time, knowing when i feel empty i can be filled up with all God has for me in his word, at the touch of a finger.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love it, my whole family is ADDICTED TO IT I RECOMEND YOU BUY IT A LOT SO MUCH FUN!!!!!!!
1400069289|5.0|The book was shipped quickly to me and arrived just as expected. So far the book - The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business - is very informative and is a good read.I haven't finished it yet, but I would definitely recommend it so far!
0345803485|3.0|First, a confession. When deciding if I'm going to read a book, I start with the negative reviews. Why?  Because if the things other readers complain about (bad writing, bad punctuation, etc.) are things that will bother me, that helps me make the decision.  Based on the reviews, I had no intentions of reading this book. Then my book club selected it for our April selection.<br /><br />I was expecting this book to be terrible; it wasn't. I've read much worse.  It also wasn't as great as other people have made it out to be.  Personally, I didn't find the book to be shocking.  I also didn't find it exiting or titillating. The writing wasn't great, but it wasn't a struggle to get through either.<br /><br />In other words, this book just was. If you're curious what all the hype is about, read it, it won't hurt. As for myself, I'm glad I borrowed the copy I read because I'd be angry if I'd spent $10 on it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such a great read!  Very easy to read, dragged on a bit for me in the beginning... I guess I was getting excited to read about the actual games which went by so fast!  Bought the 2nd book immediately after completing the first one!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I decided to read this book to see what all the hype was about. I already had my mind made up that this book wasn't about anything I would enjoy reading about, and figured I wouldn't be able to stay interested in it. I LOVED this book and the following two books. I even went to see the movie not long after finishing all the books. I hope you enjoy them as much as I did!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|What a great app! this really helped pass the time during a layover ... looks great on our Kindle Fire too. Hope there are free updates in the future because I want MORE haha
B0058VW36U|5.0|he's too cute. when I played the demo kindle in the store it was fun. he's om nom. and he actually makes me feel bad when he doesn't get the candy. you can pick a donut or a cupcake when the app screen starts if you want, just tap the candy. but candy seems more fun. i bought it. its a good deal to me and I'm new to touch screen.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Logan Thibault is a man kept alive by the photograph of a woman he doesn't know. From this premise Sparks tugs at your heartstrings.  I sometimes felt his prose is a bit slow but that's only because I wanted it to speed up to the romantic parts. Logan is a sympathetic character, and I loved his sensitivity. Sparks again does not disappoint. I can't wait to see the movie. Zac Efron in a Nicholas Sparks movie is great casting.
0525478817|5.0|My roommate Kaetlyn sat in awkward dismay on the futon as I sobbed on the old, blue love seat across the room. She had her computer on her lap and she tried to distract herself by scanning Facebook and Twitter. The decaf coffee I had made to trick my mind into staying awake had turned cold, and I stared at the bare-black cover of  The Fault in Our Stars.    Felto walked in the room to me sobbing and asked, \\"Is there something wrong?\\"    \\"I finished the book,\\" I gasped between blowing my nose and wiping my eyes with another tissue. A pile laid there on the floor. I had been crying for at least forty pages.    \\"I see that.\\"    \\"It was sad.\\"    \\"I'm sorry,\\" she said, laughing.  \\"That's not funny at all.\\"    Believe it or not, it is actually a rare occurance for me to cry over a book. I can only remember a few times I've felt so much at an end. Therefore, it is easy to conclude that John Green has accomplished something rare. He has made us fall in love with characters so much that we cannot let them go after they speak their last words. He has created a story that breaks hearts; that makes us accept reality as it is and hate how depraved and wicked the world is.    The main character, Hazel Grace, is an atheist sixteen-year-old girl living with cancer, who falls in love with an agnostic seventeen-year-old boy, Augustus. Augustus is a cancer survivor, and Hazel is expecting death in a few years, maybe. She does not know how much time she has left.    Christians might be (I hope they aren't) turned off by the atheist and agnostic comments in the book, but there is a truth in them. Hazel prays even though she doesn't believe in God, or god. She prays because it seems proper to pray; she struggles with knowing why the universe exists as it does. I feel like that's a common state of adolescence: you're in this unknown place and you're not sure why it exists, and you're beginning to realize that you'll never really know because they are not in your textbook.    (Us Christians may say that they haven't found the right textbook yet, but for most people, The Bible is a book. I don't know if they ever categorize it as fiction; I do know that they don't actually see the truth of the words within it.)    And, Hazel has reasons to be atheist. She has a terminal disease, and has no answer as to why she was the one to develop mutant cells. She has met plenty of other teenagers with cancer, and she has seen how their names just get tacked on to an end of a list when they die. They're the grocery list of prayer. She has no reason to believe that she'll be nothing but a name on a list, and a grenade to anyone she has touched emotionally.    So she falls in love--a passionate, unconditional love. Augustus loves her in the same way. They enter a relationship they know cannot last; they see the danger from the beginning. Unlike most teenage relationships, there are no rosy sunglasses beneath their eyes. And it breaks your heart because their love doesn't end in the book, and you want to fight the universe so that they could live and be together and get in fights and break up like normal teenagers. But nothing is normal for them.    It makes you think about your own life and your own relationships and you realize how fragile it all is. How lucky you are that you know you have a chance to grow old with someone. You realize that you're lucky you have a God that is good to you and who does nothing in vain. But then you realize that you can't comfort yourself in this tragedy. Hazel and Augustus would not find a pleasant afterlife.    I know, I know. They're characters.  That comforts me a lot.I don't actually have to worry about what happens to them after the novel ends.  I still struggled a lot with all of this as I read the TFiOS, but I as I sat, looking at the black cover (I had taken the sleeve off to keep it nice), I realized that I ached to start reading it again as soon as I finished it.    But I wouldn't change a single part of the story. That happens to me. I guess there is a first for everything. It may beat out Northanger Abbey as my favorite.    Well done, John Green, well done.    [...]
0205313426|5.0|If you write--for school, for work, or for a profession--this book should be in your personal library. Although less than one hundred pages, The Elements of Style spans a great deal: from grammar to misused words and phrases to style. I also love the timelessness of this book; the first edition was written in 1918.<br /><br />I believe everyone can benefit from this book, but especially those who do not want to read tomes of grammar rules. This book will fit in your pocket or purse.<br /><br />I only wish I had discovered it when I was in school.
B005I2YL4G|5.0|I bought this hoping to build a decent HTPC rig that could handle any media I throw at it as well as anything else I didn't think of.  I didn't build this for gaming and have not tested the APU against any graphics-intense games.<br />I was worried at first that the stock heatsink/fan would be too loud for an HTPC, but I was wrong.  Even under full load, this thing is quiet and cool (I can barely hear it unless I put my head right next to the case).  I think this is in part due to the fact it is only 65W TDP.  Having the three cores is a nice bonus (would have bought the 4-core with 65W TDP if I could find it for sale...), but the three cores are more than enough for all multimedia, browsing the Internet, decompressing files, etc.  Blu-Ray playback is butter-smooth as is all multimedia I've thrown at it.<br /><br />All in all, a perfect processor/GPU combination for a great price that does everything I wanted it too very smoothly.<br /><br />My HTPC build for those who are curious:<br />APEX DM-317 mATX Case w/275Watt PSU<br />ASUS F1A75-M Pro Motherboard<br />AMD A6-3500 APU (these APUs are perfect for HTPCs...get the lower TDP ones like the 65W to keep things cool and quiet)<br />Crucial 64GB m4 SSD (not really necessary, but the boot time is literally like 10 seconds)<br />2x Old MAXTOR 160GB SATA drives (RAID 0)<br />LG Blu-Ray Burner (not sure which model, I bought it like 2.5 years ago)<br />8GB Kingston HyperX 1600Mhz DDR3 (for 64bit Windows 7 Pro)<br />Enermax UC-8EB 80mm silent case fan
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This app provides a challenging and fun new twist on a puzzle maze game!  Very well developed and thought out with great graphics.  Enjoyed Quell so much I purchased this app!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This series is the only set of books that I have read through the first time and then immediately started reading them again.<br /><br />They are graphic, about sex, but also contain a compelling love story and some intrigue and humor as well.  You can't help but be hooked!
B007549YM4|5.0|I ordered this BD and got it very quickly at a great price !  The movie is very well done / acted and the story is a lot more real life than one would think . It is about us and how we act and react when we have to survive .
B007V2UGPE|4.0|its fun but its just another game that isn't really special. but its free so why not? I guess id suggest it if you're bored.
0741470314|5.0|When there is so many negative things written and said about Michael Jackson, this book was a breath of fresh air.  If the world knew more about Michael, his charity work and natural goodness he may still be here today.  This is a very informative book about his great work and how the world is darker without him here.  Thank you Dr. Karen Moriarty for this positive book of the great Michael Jackson.
B000YMJA7I|5.0|I actually own most of the songs already in CDs because come on, these songs have been rock classics for a while now.  And of course you can't beat the uncompressed CD audio quality, even though these higher bit rate songs are not too bad.<br /><br />Music-wise this is a no-brainer if you are a rock or guitar fan.  Now this was my second album purchase on Amazon's music store and the convenience factor is really cool.  I have a HTC Thunderbolt and the Amazon cloud player integrates nicely with the phone.  At first I was a little taken back at how its integration into the android music player, but it is tastefully done and actually functional in that it really gives me easy access to all my music over cellular or wifi connection.
B004I744AS|5.0|when I first opened this app I was impressed by what it offered ...especially FREE! I have found no problems enjoy the added features.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it was a great game easy to follow. the story line is fun an the characters are funny just like the movies
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I love it and it keeps my kids entertained on long car rides. its a lot of fun watching them challenge. rather other to see who can get the highest points.
B000Y5JFNY|4.0|I bought this during one of Amazon's one day deals.  I can't say enough about the beautiful transfer of the movie,  everything is gorgeous and the sound is amazing.  Now about the packaging...it arrived with the movement in the music box unglued and within one day the entire box separated at the seams and fell apart.  It's not that big of a deal to me since I bought it for the movie but if I had payed full price I would have to knock off another star for the poor packaging.
0439023491|5.0|Great book if possible it was just as good as the first one. I read it in 2 days. Can't wait to read the 3rd book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wanted to know what all the hype was about The Hunger Games, since the movie came out. So I purchased the book, I really enjoyed it, so much so I ordered the second book in the series's .
B005723JSQ|5.0|Just like her other books-- absolutely hilarious and kept me wanting to read more. Reminded me a lot of Can You Keep a Secret (one of my favorite books!)
0553801473|1.0|This book was terrible, it took me a month to read it and I am a very fast reader. I have a the same complaints other reviewers have, nothing happens. The only plot point that stuck with me was the rape of a 12 year old girl, and its not that it was good writing, it was so sick I can't get it out of my mind. Seriously, is this book actually up for a Hugo? Because I have some of my own writing from when I was 16 that are better then this garbage, I want a Hugo nomination to. Pass this book and series up, GRRM may not be my B***H but someone needs to let him know that I am not his either, I guess I'll just have to let my wallet tell GRRM that.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Interesting and unbiased book about an Entrepreneur that was just a man, with the same demons and fragile qualities as all of us. He may have not been perfect but because of this it helped him strive and achieved ....and demanded no less of anyone else...perfection.  A must read
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|A really great story, As usual Jeffery managed to leave you suspended at the end of the first book. So I simply had to get the second book and can't wait for the third in the series.
1409136612|4.0|Great book. Very small and had it shipped from England to the US. Almost a disappointment but worth it to get another Maeve Binchy book!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game but wish it had some of the original game in it, or at least create a remake of the original version
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My seven year old and I enjoy this game.  Easy concept with continuous reward and advancement.<br />Finding scrat is our favorite thing to do.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Someone suggested I read the book before seeing the movie. I am now on Mockingjay, the third book in the series, and highly recommend them all. I like that I can't predict what will happen next, or the outcome. How often can you find good, clean books with \\"page-turner\\" excitement? This is one of them.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|has so many different versions and really easy to find verses. there are many audio versions, however many bibles still need more.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|A book that every woman must read!  Once started it is impossible to put down.  Each book flows nicely from one to the next.  The books take you to a place that every woman can only dream of ever going.  Wealthy, spunky, highly intelligent man who wants to love and care for the woman of his dreams - with just a little kinky on the side!<br />I finished the trilogy in just under a week and now I'm wondering what can live up to it?!<br />Highly reccommended ladies :)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|well I can say it is amazingly fun for any age. though I don't think people should have purchases with real money. I think it should not have purchases with real money but play money in the game. so you should put in a compliant to gameloft if you have had the same problem. it is very easy for your child to mistake it for play money in the game. I have also noticed many of you complaining of not being able to get off the app for that I would also put in a complaint. of these things I will give it a 5 star rating. however parents. and children. be wary. for I am but a mere child myself.<br />  thank you for your time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a wonderful book.  It was so full of exciting turns and twists that I couldn't put it down until I had finished it.  I immediately ordered the 2nd book in the series!  Can't wait to see the rest of the story.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I haven't stopped playing! wish I didn't have to wait so long for more energy though. other than that no complaints
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Its an amazing story, takes you very deep in the feelings of Katniss. I just felt in loved, the only bad thing is that I finished it, and I miss being in the story all the time, to heal my sadness I have to go over again and read some chapters. It's like loosing someone that really touch you very deeply. I really recommend this book, the best for me.
B007Q476KU|1.0|BOOO. I know these movies are supposed to be for entertainment only but come on. I should have waited till it was 99 cents then I would feel like I have been cheated out of only a buck.
B0071PS7AC|3.0|Semi entertaining. User friendly. Not much variance though. Rather predictable. Cute the first twelve times or so, but then pretty basic.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|So very tired.! The \\"Wool omnibus\\" was a recurring recommendation but my very  jaded view of modern SF did not believe the reviews. They are all right. Vivid descriptions, breath taking cliff hangers, great characters, real relationships, compassion, understanding and vision.  I read until the early hours of the morning and haven't done that for years. Oh yes and an ending that  could lead to more but is so satisfying.
B0018BB21G|5.0|I ordered a used CD from Avatar music in the UK. The Correct CD arrived quickly, well packaged and the disk was in Incredible condition, not a mark to be found on it ! Brilliant service , superior product ! Thanks Ronny
B006T5FDLG|3.0|I can say that Metallica did good when they released beyond magnetic, but it was a big difference from back in the Ride The Lightning years. They're not quite the same but oh well haha, Im a Metallica fan an im just fine with what they are doing now.
B000FCJZ3G|4.0|I don't read \\"money books\\" that often, but this one came by way of a colleague's recommendation so I checked it out... and LOVED it! I took one star for the shameless advertising the author engages in and the incompleteness of some ideas (i.e., one has to attend a seminar or purchase another product for a full description), but that said, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and laughed out loud at many of the author's anecdotes (and I hardly laugh at stand-up comedy!). In the end, the author approaches a serious topic with just the right amount of wit and wisdom, and, as a consequence, I have seriously changed the way I manage my money.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who wishes to gain a new perspective of wealth and money!
B005T87QCI|5.0|This game is awesoooooome.I defeated two robots already.And I can play as Ambush, blue bot, and others.And you get to do specials that technically makes your opponent lose life.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|there are times when I have to grind and I hate losing babies and letting them go but its a fun game regardless.
B0064NTZQ2|2.0|the beginning is good action and it will keep your interest. however once the story begins you will find yourself thinking of other things other than the movie. the story does wrap up nicely though but it is not a fast paced action movie, its more of a romantic action kinda deal.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|This app works just fine on the Kindle Fire. what else is there to say? This is UNO, if you have played the game before and you like it then buy it! If you have never played the game, for the price (half off 99 cents currently), it is worth a try. It looks like the the game has online multiplayer as as well as multi device local multiplayer, and ofcourse single device mutiplayer.

B001EBWING|5.0|I rented Casablanca as I hadn't seen it in years. I downloaded it onto my Kindle Fire and watched it on a long airplane flight. It was great!
0060920432|5.0|Wow. Imagine that. The psychology of optimal experience. What a revelation this book was to me when I first read it way back in 1990. Imagine looking at what makes people happy and engaged rather than sad and depressed.<br /><br />I've always wanted to reread it and now I have. It was just as engaging and powerful this time as it was twenty years ago. I feel happy just thinking about times I've been in that experience of flow, when I was engaged in a task that I had the ability to solve but that required the devotion of my entire self to accomplish the job.<br /><br />A must-read for anyone interested in happiness.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard about this book on the Today Show and was really curious.  I got it and read it in two days - it really holds your attention!  It's a fast read and a page turner!  You have GOT to read this book!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|works terribly on ics. will it resume your game when you turn off the screen in the middle of a game? maybe, depending on who the hell knows. also it won't save volume settings, so you better make sure your volume is down before firing this up at work. but hey, at least it's no longer crashing! man, get it together pop cap!
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is very addicting and fun. one of the best apps ever. I think everyone should get this spectacular game.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|I had wanted to buy this for awhile,  - just always afraid I will pay for it and end up having buyers remorse. Not this time. This is so much fun - kept me up way past my bedtime. Plus it's on sale right now ;). No bugs for me - works perfect on my kindle fire. The only negative is that I wished I could leave and come back with my games being saved. Kind of sucks to lose all your progress in the middle of a tournament.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|dis is da worst game ever in India we never had such horrible games we had fish the goat and karma karma mama and donkey call me,  but nothing like this, this game is goat crape,  no download.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|this app is not worthy of a single review, but i have to give it 1 star to submit this review. no good comes from the content in this app.
B00000E3HM|5.0|The Karajan Mahler Fourth is one of the best played.  The Berlin gets a spotless, perfect, beautiful execution of every aspect of the music.  The tempos are a little on the slow side, making for a slightly sadder tone.  If this is Nature music, then this must be Fall.

0345803485|5.0|After reading some of the reviews before I bought this book, I wasn't really sure it'd be worth it or not. But I was totally surprised, although I've never read anything of this nature. I could hardly put it down!!! Also, I've just ordered the next two editions. I thought this was Erotic, Exotic, Excellent!!!

I was under the impression that everything<br />was new and first class, no way a NEW RELEASE should be a bootlegg copy! Don't know if I'll order anymore DVD's from AMAZON. I've ordered books and have been very happy with the products but my first experience with the DVD'S? Also I've written regarding this matter and no one has contacted me! Sorry I did enjoy the movie.

0547258305|3.0|Spoilers<br /><br />Wow, what a book!  I really misunderstood the plot summary when I first saw it.  I saw the words &#34;able to kill a man with her bare hands&#34; and moved on.<br /><br />Here's what I loved about the story:<br />*Katsa can kill with her bare hands, but she doesn't like to (I also loved her name).<br />*Without her greedy uncle knowing, King Randa, Katsa forms a council that helps strangers in other lands who are faced with injustices.  She leads the council in investigating distant rumors, forming plans, and carrying out deeds to help others in need when no one else will.<br />*Katsa thinks her Grace is killing, she finds out it's more than that later in the story.<br />*Katsa and Po become instant friends after he learns she has rescued his imprisoned grandfather.  It turns out that Po is also a graceling and he gives Katsa his trust.<br />*Po spends much of the story proving himself to Katsa and respects her.  He watches her without showing it and understands her better than anyone else.<br />*Katsa learns she can control her rage and considers every angle before deciding to fight someone.  She's always considering consequences for herself and others she cares about.<br />*Katsa finally decides to stand up to her greedy uncle and in doing so forfeits the only home she's ever had.<br />*Katsa is a fair fighter and displays mercy even when she is instructed to be brutal.<br />*There are 7 kingdoms and 7 kings in this story-represents a perfect number in God's kingdom.<br />*Katsa doesn't ever want to get married or have children because she sees herself as a killer and is afraid of getting close to anyone.  She also believes that falling in love will cause her to lose her identity and control of her own life.<br /><br />This book is so well written and it pulls the reader in right from the first page.  Katsa's fights and movements are described more as a dance; I saw more beauty in her physical abilities than brutality.  She's also very in tuned to her environment and she's supernaturally strong.  She has no personality and doesn't understand her emotions or how to enjoy herself, but I would guess that anyone in her situation would be the same way.  She doesn't like injustice or bullies and she's very good at perceiving a person's true nature.  It's impossible to sneak up on her, lie to her, mistreat others in front of her, or approach her.  However, she's passionate, genuine, and protective.  I so enjoyed the romance between her and Po, he learns her quickly but allows her to feel comfortable around him.  He lets her lead, but he also teaches her to control her anger and she listens to him.  He's also very perceptive and in tune.<br /><br />There are two love scenes between Katsa and Po and that was the only inappropriate content I came across.  The first one is only a paragraph in length and doesn't give details, but it's descriptive enough and since the characters are in love it will seem justified to some readers (it was disappointing for me).  The second time it happens, it's more implied and the scene moves on.  There is no profanity in the book at all and the most of the book is about the journey Katsa and Po go on together while discovering their feelings for one another as well as the extent of their graces/skills.<br /><br />I didn't finish the book for personal reasons, but it's towards the end they both have to face one king who is the true villain in the story and the plot intensifies at this point.  Even though Katsa's greedy uncle is a manipulating and controlling man, he is not the real villain.  I enjoyed reading about the differences between each king and the how Katsa is determined to do the right thing even though she has been shunned as a graceling.  She is both feared and respected; she has learned to live most of her life in isolation due to her unique skills, but it was awesome reading about her strengths and how she sees herself.<br /><br />I learned that Fire is considered a companion to Graceling, not the sequel.  I believe Fire is more of a background story to Graceling.  Bitterblue is the true sequel to Graceling, but it appears to be a stand alone book.  I enjoyed what I read in Graceling even though I didn't finish the story and I'm glad I went through with it even though I initially bypassed it.  I'm more into happy endings and I'm not sure if Graceling has one.the true sequel to Graceling, but it appears to be a stand alone book.

B0077SGMXM|5.0|this is a great game even though I am not very good at it. I wish you could make it easier.
0985114606|5.0|I loved this story. For the Fifty and Beautiful Disaster Lovers out there, you will love this book because it has a very similar feel and flow to it. A hopelessly flawed hero, Gideon, and heroine, Eva, enter into a relationship eclipsed by false starts, petty jealousies, misunderstandings, and bruised trust. The story was beautifully written from Eva's POV but the angst of both characters and their associates was palpable throughout the entire book.<br /><br />Ms. Day definitely wrote a highly emotionally charged story. This book will most likely be part of a triadic series, and the next book Deeper in You is slated to come out sometime in October.
B00756GKBA|2.0|This album is so mediocre and lame! Having Niki Minaj, MIA and some generic top 40 producer does not make it good [not even good after repeated listens]. This album is so unoriginal. Sad effort to be accepted by the masses again. FAIL.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I enjoy the way the game overlaps different aspects.  Not only are you trying to build a new...thriving town..but you also must grow enoughfood for thebusinesses and towns people.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Downloading books to my Kindle is so convenient, easy and fast.  No waiting on lists or going out to shop.  The story was very unique, a little different than the types of books I usually read.  I enjoyed it very much, and am currently reading the final book in the series.

1594744769|4.0|I really liked the video description of this book because it reminded me of The Princess Bride (which is a movie I happen to really like), and I instantly bought this book to read. I was confused about the what the book was really about until I went on wikipedia and read the plot, then I fully understood what the book was about. I liked the book all the way through until the very end. The end just ended and it seemed like there was supposed to be a sequel to this book (and I know there won't be to keep up the mystery), but I really don't like books that just end. I have a tough imagination for what happens in the future for the book. That is why I give it a 4. I would give a 5 for the book and a -1 for the ending.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Ken Follett is a great storey teller. This a very long book, but it holds your attension. It covers an era of history that is fasinating. His previous book \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" is also a very good novel.
0307719774|5.0|After reading the reviews I was a bit skeptical. I went ahead and ordered it and absolutely love it! The negative reviews are petty. Who cares if there isn't a bookmark to mark your spot? Just open the book and look for the correct date, or use your own bookmark. And the book does, in fact, lay flat if you spread it out enough. It doesn't lay perfectly flat but enough to write in. It's not hard to write it. If you write small there is ample room for your entries. The point of the journal isn't to delve into your innermost, deepest thoughts, but rather to capture a little piece of \\"today\\" so you can compare it with \\"tomorrow\\" and see how you've developed. That is probably why the book isn't bigger. It's money well spent! I love it so much I'm going to get one for my daughter.

0439023521|4.0|I was a little skeptical about The Hunger Games. After all, the Twilight series just didn't give me a lot of confidence in our mass culture's ability to select really good books recently. But I eventually didn't like being left out and decided that I might give it a try, and when the film came out, I really didn't want my students to be giving the ending away to me. So, I started it and pretty well read it that night. It was good.<br /><br />I like how Collins has managed to take several adventure-tale plot structures and balance them all together. There's a standard underdog versus the world story, a brewing rebellion versus a tyrannical power plotline, the being hunted on a deserted island type of plot, and even a love triangle throughout. Plus, there are hints--with the mockingjay symbol, for instance--of a mythical side of this story.<br /><br />I admired, too, how Collins managed her characters. Katniss and Peeta are heroic, but they're also far from invulnerable, far from flawed, and far from being superheroes. Additionally, Collins was clever in making the story appropriately intense and violent without either copping out (Peeta and Katniss do participate in the violence) or making the protagonist(s) lose their integrity and likeability.<br /><br />The novel did leave me with several questions. I keep wondering, for instance, how to reconcile the very high level of technology that Panem clearly has with both the seemingly low population and the level of anxiety they show toward the colonies. Maybe those things will be clarified in later books, but for now, they leave me wondering.<br /><br />I am also wondering, though, in the way that every writer wants their readers to wonder...I am wondering what is going to happen next. I have already purchased the next couple of books in the series, but I am waiting until I'm going to have enough time to devote to them. I know that once I start, I'm pretty well going to put the rest of my life on hold until I'm through.
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|I read this lens in a few forums and decided to give it a try. This lens was used on a Canon SX40. I took some pictures in the neighborhood and i was very impressed. There is a \\" sweetspot\\" on this lens which allows you to have perfect focus. I had to achieve this by moving my camera back and forth since I don't have much manual focus on this camera. With a DSLR you have much more room to play with since you can manual focus easier.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|The \\"Hunger Games\\" is a wonderful story.  I did not think I would enjoy this book since it was supposed to be for young adults.  But, once I started reading the story I felt like I could visualize the scences and the action.  Wonderfully written, dynamic story and when I got to the end I had to order the next two stories in this trilogy.  These books are exceptional written.  I truly advise you before, you see the movie, read the book. It made the movie truly enjoyable.  This book and the rest of the series will blow you away.

B006PZBR8S|4.0|This is essentially a father-son bonding experience over a boxing robot. Hugh plays an absentee father and former boxer who makes a living controlling a robot against various adversaries. Dakota is soon thrust in his lap, finds an aptitude for the sport, and becomes Hugh's better half in the enterprise as they travel around boxing. Dakota eventually obtains his own robot, and the two field it against the top robot champion in a Rocky-esque showdown.<br /><br />It's a very slickly-produced movie. The special effects are flawless: we might as well inhabit a world with giant lumbering robots. The fight scenes are least as exciting as those in Warrior and better than anything in Transformers. The latter is particularly surprising; the robots here are the equivalent of RC cars, but through evocative design and the emotional investment of the human characters, they have more personality than the sentient Transformers.<br /><br />There is a romantic subplot that involves the daughter of Hugh's former trainer, but it's of no consequence. More interesting are the various unscrupulous characters that inhabit Hugh's underworld early in the  movie. The real standout, though, is Dakota. He's absolutely convincing as hurt, slighted son, and later in his bonding with Hugh and the robot. Tremendous range in general, and not just for a child actor. He constantly steals scenes from Hugh.<br /><br />I do have a few nits to pick. This version of Hugh is significantly dumber than Wolverine. His early misfortunes are self-inflicted from errors improbable for the experienced robot handler he portrays. It's hard to suspend disbelief when your hard-luck protagonist blows his last shot by half-assing fight preparation. There's also a lack of personal growth at odds with the upbeat ending. He doesn't care about the kid at the outset, but while he becomes less bitter as the movie progresses, he ends up less a father than an accomplice. A number of like plot threads are left open after the final match. This is all a bit unsatisfying, but leaves the franchise primed for a sequel that should appear in 2014.<br /><br />My second nit involves some rather heavy-handed string-pulling by the director. We've got shots of the cute kid with a single tear, longing gazes by the romantic interest, extended montages, some truly cheeseball announcer commentary, and an emotional score that announces itself when we're supposed to feel something. The pity of it is, the actors don't need all this assistance, and most of it just pulled me out of the story.  The pastiche of Hollywoodisms isn't so egregious as in something like Pearl Harbor, though it does take away from could otherwise have been a fairly powerful film.<br /><br />All that aside, it's a very original premise with lots of excitement and good acting. The plot arc was transparent almost from the get-go, but I still wanted to stick around to see how it played out. That's a pretty solid endorsement.<br /><br />And how is it for children? The CGI robot battles won't raise eyebrows, though the two lead humans do get beaten up in one short scene. Obscenities are rare. The F-bomb doesn't make an appearance. There's no onscreen sex or anything resembling it. Gambling is a constant presence. The emotional scenes are no more traumatic than those in the Land Before Time. I'd say that any kid 8 or above should be fine.it unsatisfying, but leaves the franchise primed for a sequel that should appear in 2014.

0307887898|5.0|This book is a must read for any entrepreneur because it changes  your thinking of how a typical startup should be managed. I wouldn't say these are entirely new ideas but the way they are presented is in a way that I have not seen. The book is divided into 3 parts: 1. Vision, 2. Steer, and 3. Accelerate. Without getting into too much detail about each section, the overall goal of the book is to get you to think differently from the past in terms of having a homerun plan and solid strategy. While this helps, it does not mean that is the only way of managing a startup. The author uses numerous examples to show how the old management techniques are not necessarily the correct one for this century. For example, it is better to release an unperfected product and then run tests rather than having one big launch. His section on accountability is interesting in that there are metrics that are not necessarily industry standard but in a startup they should be. I could write more on the book but I would highly recommend this book to any budding entrepreneur!

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I wasn't excited about Stephen King's latest book because I thought it was a complete departure from his usual horror tales.  I was born in 1977, so I was not interested in the whole JFK conspiracy, as someone older would be.  I should have gotten it as soon as it came out like I did with 'Under the Dome' because it is one of his best books! I dragged out the last few chapters because I didn't want it to end!  It is suspenseful, romantic, informative and really piqued my interest regarding JFK, Oswald and the aftermath of the assassination. I will not doubt my favorite author's ability to write a non-horror novel again. :-)

This may also be the single most important skill that people need to succeed in life.<br /><br />Jay Asher has written a novel that beautifully demonstrates many of the good and bad ways people can communicate and the very real consequences that can exist as a result.<br /><br />I discovered this book after reading Asher's follow up - The Future of Us...I am looking forward to reading everything he writes in the future!

B&N is replacing it within their 1 year warrantee.<br /><br />The first one I got was bad out of the box, a quick exchange and there were no problems (this happens people, there is nothing to be done about it you just have to suck it up).<br />The next one worked wonders.<br /><br />So I love the touch screen, just tapping the right edge of the screen to change pages is great.  The display is crisp. I like that you now have the option of how big you want your margins.  There are far fewer add ins than the first generation had and I don't miss them at all.  However, I think the library is more difficult to browse now, and you have no choice but to set up folders.<br /><br />The battery life is amazing.  I've had it for about 2 months, I have charged it three times and I read at least 4-6 hours a day with it.<br /><br />No AC charging adapter with it, just a USB cable.  Cheap morons, but whatever, I have an adapter from my HTC phone charger anyway.<br /><br />I don't like any of the accessories B&N offers so I bought a rooCase from Amazon for it.  Love that.

It reminds me of Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card which is high praise indeed.  It is another book recommended for young adults in which bright kids are trying to survive in the future.  Violence is not my normal preference, but these two books are beautifully written.

I was anxious to start The Lost City, and immediately got so involved that I didn't put it down until it was completed.  It took a few hours without using hints, so it was reasonably challenging. Nice length  for a game.  I had to take notes and make sketches in conjunction with the game journal because of my poor recall.  Look forward to the next offering by Fire Maple!
B0063IH60K|4.0|great download and easy to use. the only thing that would make this better would be if it keep track of your stats. pop up adds only occur when its connected to the Internet and your playing.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have never read thru a trilogy so fast in my life....I just wish there more in the series. I loved it and felt like i was right there. Very descriptive.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I found this book completely annoying...I couldnt even get through 20% of it.  Not a romance or erotic novel at all...writing goes around and around saying the same exact thing page after page...just awful
B007DKNEI0|5.0|I'm sure any ardent collector or those who are aspiring for an MA or Phd in TD music must have all the virgin catalog in different releases be it in LP, cd, cassette, 8 track etc. But for anyone who is always on the move and would like to enjoy this collection in the car or out of earth, this comes in handy.7 albums in 5 cds and in one case the more convenient it is. Sound quality is close to the 1995 definitive remaster. The booklet details exact information taken from the individual albums plus an insert sourced from the encore LP sleeve. No new material except A and B sides from Encore and Thief or 4 additional tracks. One downside is the exclusion of the soundtrack Thief. It depends on anyones preference but Tangram and Logos were split into separate discs much similar to the original LP. A good buy for new collectors who don't have the cds yet. Suitable for travelers or those working abroad and left their collections back home. But for those who have a permanent address, there is no need, it will only be redundant. The A and B sides are very similar to the original only shortened. The next project should be the Virgin soundtracks by TD, now this will be great and something to look forward too.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I personally wish it was more like a bundle pack of three different books instead of one really long one containing all three. Other than that, I loved it. I liked that I could instantly get these books for cheaper than going out and buying the physical set.<br /><br />As for the books themselves, I really enjoyed them. They are an easy read and hard to put down.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|I Love this movie!!!! I thought I had it on DVD but didn't. I ordered it and received it quickly and at a great price... A must have for your collection!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|As a student of English Linguistics, I was so happy to not only find the mother of all American English dictionaries in app form, but to find it for FREE. M-W is superior to the default dictionary on the Kindle Fire. For starters, searching for a word is intuitive rather than confusing!

B002JVWR4A|5.0|Why are there so few mysteries, including mega-million-dollar thriller movies, much less TV series - that are simultaneously funny, suspenseful, humanly engaging, credible, and beautifully cast and acted?<br /><br />Because it's incredibly hard to get all those things right. Oh, and I forgot - add \\"sustained through many seasons.\\"<br /><br />Bones is simply amazing - no other word. David Boreanaz as Booth is perfect (he actually could be a former Army Ranger sniper; if you doubt, try reading Eric L. Haney's excellent book, Inside Delta Force), as is Emily Deschanel as Temperance Brennan.<br /><br />The people who made this series are exceptional. They should do a documentary, or a book, about them so that we can get to know them. Contact with the series is humanly enriching; very likely spending time with the writers and actors would be, too. More than highly recommended.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Bruce Willis rocks, Great service as usual.
030771652X|4.0|This was an engrossing novel, not the greatest thing I've ever read, but solidly entertaining. The prose occasionally lapses into overwriting, but Lupton certainly knows how to build suspense. I was able to guess many of the key mysteries before the ending (including whodunnit, and I did have my suspicions about one of the really big twists) but that didn't really bother me too much because Lupton creates such interesting, believable characters that definitely gain the reader's sympathy.

0345803485|1.0|It's Idiocracy come to life ... the ignorant among us are the only ones propagating, and one of them wrote this book.<br /><br />I thought Stephanie Meyer was terrible, but her work is Pulitzer material compared to E.L. James' dull, pat characters and ho-hum sex scenes. The prose is lifeless and trite, the characters have no depth, and the dialogue is cringe-inducing. Despite the author's changing of the names and places, the characters closely resemble Meyer's Twilight cast and are the poorer for it.<br /><br />That this book is being discussed as much as it is fills me with fear for the future of literature. Save your self the time and go read 9 1/2 weeks instead.

If you like your soundscape trips on the somnabulistic end of the spectrum, if movie soundtracks meet your musical needs,  give \\"Hurry Up, We;re Dreaming\\" a listen, and save your Valium for other times.  The tunes are indistinguishable from one another, though I had an easy time doing other things, like ironing and paying my bills.

B005MF1O5S|5.0|My children became firm fans of Doctor Who some years ago and consequently periodically I have the pleasure of watching the stories with them as we all sit on the sofa together. Quite a while ago I read an article in which one of the writers - perhaps it was Stephen Moffat, though it was back in the days when RTD was the script wrangler for the series - that a really good Doctor Who episode is the equivalent to a 60-minute film. It should be more or less complete in and of itself, and so packed with ideas, great dialog and excellent camerawork that you're left feeling totally satisfied. Every once in a while Doctor Who achieves this gold standard. For me, such perfect episodes include Rose, The Girl In the Fireplace, Blink, Turn Left, the very first episode with Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor, and now this one.<br /><br />Not only are we carried along a dual-time stream plot (one compressed a la Othello, the other linear as we watch) that is full of pathos, but in addition the camerawork is absolutely superb. This may be the single best and most consistent use of camera-as-storyteller I've ever seen. Much of the effect is achieved by counterpointing the aged Amy with her younger self in very clever side-by-side shots and overlays. It's really easy to do this kind of thing badly so the viewer is aware of the trick at the expense of the emotion; here it's the opposite, with the camerawork actually pushing the emotion deeper and further than it would otherwise go with straight shots. This is the kind of direction and camerawork that deserves an award - yet it's easy not to notice it particularly because it's all in the service of the story, which is compelling, sad, and doesn't provide an easy way out when the ultimate choice must be made: which Amy to save?<br /><br />For me, one of the very satisfying things was the clever set-up for the denoeument: the hand-bots phrase \\"this is a kindness.\\" At first, because the \\"kindness\\" will in fact be lethal to Amy, it's just scary - a great contradiction between word and deed. But in the end, when the Tardis must depart and leave the aged Amy behind, the words come true. It is, at the very end, in a heartbreaking kind of way, after all a kindness.<br /><br />If you don't know much about Doctor Who, this episode is as good as any as a place to start - and then you can have the pleasure of going all the way back to the first episode of the reboot with Christopher Ecclestone as the Ninth Doctor, and go forward from there. Or, go in any direction you want, in a wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey sort of way. Any route at all will be great fun and very satisfying.scary - a great contradiction between word and deed.

B0012FHPXW|4.0|Like most Tarja-era Nightwish fans, I was highly resistant to anyone replacing the sheer epic-ness that made such albums like 'Once' and 'Oceanborn' such keepers.  Worse, when I first heard 'Amaranth' from this album, I was completely like WTF?  Unlike some of the more rabid fans, I never expressed my dislike by actually booing the poor woman while on stage.  In fact, I felt sorry for her; it must have been hellish stepping into the shoes of a woman who inspired such passionate loyalty.<br /><br />Yes, while still a fan of Nighwish, I just couldn't bring myself to accept the more folksy-rock styling of Anette Olzon until recently.  Yes, it has been a long and strange journey to the point where Anette's voice has found itself into my psyche.  As much as I hate to admit it, her voice actually fits; though I can still imagine Tarja singing 'Bye Bye Beautiful' and making it hurt (in a good way).  However, it's really not Anette who shines here for me, but the powerful male vocals of Marco Hietala.  This man shows that it doesn't always take growling to make this genre of metal stand out.  Hietala actually SINGS, and with all the force of a hurricane.  Sad to say on some songs, such as the aforementioned 'Bye Bye Beautiful', Anette is nearly no match for the pain, the betrayal and the anguish expressed.<br /><br />Overall though, after several years of giving this a listen, I've grown to enjoy this current incarnation of Nightwish.  Tuomas is still his mental-film-scoring best and proves once again why he's the real madman behind one of the most original bands in the world.  This is a pretty good album and for me it just took some time and some distance to understand that.

B00634GHJA|5.0|great app for copying photos and videos from one device to another. This app finally got me motivated to move over 400 photos and videos off of phone to computer.  Will also be using it to move pics and videos between our different phones in our family.<br /><br />Tips:<br />1. Make sure both the sending device and the receiving device are using the SAME wireless connection.<br />2. photo download can be zipped with a push if a button and downloaded quickly.<br />3. When unzipping the photos, 7-Zip did not work ... but using Windows Explorer worked great.  Note: right click zip file folder, choose Open with Windows Explorer.  when new window opens up, choose the files in the window, and press &quot;Extract all files&quot;...and choose where to extract them to...press extract.<br />4. Download videos one at a time.<br />5. Be sure to delete photos and videos off phone memory card.<br /><br />Enhancement I would like to see is being able to zip videos as well.<br /><br />To the developers, thank you for such a useful app.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I confess, I needed a \\"filler\\" book to read while waiting for another book to be released next month.  This book was supposed to last a couple weeks and my expectations weren't too high.  Well, this book completely messed up my plan!!!  I read it in three days and it blew me away!  I couldn't put it down!!  I am VERY picky when it comes to what I read.  I dislike murders, mysteries, romance, big name authors, etc.  I found myself thinking about it after I put it down and then couldn't wait until I picked it up again.  I am making my sister read it now.  I now have a new favorite author, and plan to read the rest of his books.  GREAT job Mr. Howey!!

B007JRU2UK|1.0|A rich dysfunctional family attempts find a way to love each other. They make hard decisions between owning a piece of paradise or going from million to gazillionaires.

0345803485|1.0|I confess-  I can read bodice rippers, historic romances, and smut just as well as more literary endeavors, but am really disgusted with myself that I fell for the hype and read the trilogy.<br /><br />The hero is entirely unsympathetic, and the heroine seems like a dope.  Why, please God, must she be a completely not credible 21 year old college senior and virgin?<br /><br />True to the genre, though, through the attentions of a misunderstood and tortured hero, she is instantly able to leap from blissful, shy ignorance, into a swinging from the spanner bars BDSM \\"romance\\" and is, of course, explosively multi-orgasmic from the get-go.<br /><br />The supposed kerfuffle over the shocking news that real women like sex and even smutty novels aside, these books are as painful (no pun intended), as they are repetitive and absurd.<br /><br />Ick, ick, ick.<br /><br />No doubt the author and publishing house are laughing all the way to the bank, but this one is really a stinkeroo.<br /><br />There is great erotic writing.  This ain't it.

B001GY0FHM|4.0|I saw this movie the first time when it came out in the cinema, and I have loved it since. Naturally, it doesn't always make sense (especially in the scene where the entire ship is lifted up from the ocean floor without any physical effects on the characters), yet some of the scenes, especially the one in which the female hero drowns to be then rescued in a magnificient series of close-up shots are splendid. Great actors too, all absolutely believable.
1904920233|5.0|This is such a great recipe book, and is presented beautifully! Many other customers complained about their favourite wagamama dishes being absent; well of course they're not going to include their whole menu, then people would stop going back to their restaurants! There is still a great range of recipes in this book, and I really love it.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|But I didn't regret it. I like to watch this with my daughters (11 and 13) and the story is still as enyoable as I recall. The quality of the disc (visuals and sound) is acceptible.
0062060554|5.0|This thriller, the author's debut novel, kept me up very late at night in order to finish it.  It's one of the best thrillers that I have read in recent months.  While some readers found it a bit unbelievable and contrived, it is a book of fiction and as I read I got that \\"what if?\\" feeling.  What if I went to sleep after suffering a head injury years ago and every single time I woke up I remembered nothing about my life, not even my address or my surroundings?  This is what happened to Christine Lucas, now a middle-aged woman living outside London with her husband, Ben.  Every day he must remind her who he is and that they have been married for a long time.  He leaves instructions for household chores to keep her busy and occupied during the day.<br /><br />In order to get some greatly needed help, Christine secretly begins to see a doctor, and he suggests writing down each day in a journal everything that she remembers. She can then go back and read what her memory has told her the day before, thereby rebuilding, in part, some of her former life. Her husband fills in some of the gaps for her, but even I began to question what the truth really was, so I can imagine Christine's confusion.<br /><br />Watson did an excellent job with his debut novel.  Little by little Christine's life is revealed until the tension builds up to the ending.  I had several ideas about what was happening, but I turned out to be wrong.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I hope to see more by this author soon.<br /><br />Highly recommended for readers who like thrillers and/or mysteries.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Extremely disappointed with this read.  It was redundant/repetitive and boring have read MUCH better books.  Will not even purchase book 2.  Waste of money!!

0071762345|5.0|As Social Media Manager at a burgeoning internet start-up, I take it upon myself to read as much literature on the subject as possible. I consider myself a well-read professional in the field, and find myself searching for flaws and oversights as I read each new publication. I have to confess that upon cracking each new book, I'm thinking, \\"Here we go again.\\" That was not the case for this book. Kudos to Dave Kerpen for penning an insightful, highly readable guide to social media marketing. The text was clear and appropriately descriptive. The advice had a cutting-edge quality, even when covering well worn topics. Furthermore, I decided to keep this book as a go-to reference after reading only 50 pages (It continues to excel throughout!). I heartily recommend this book to anyone in marketing.

But it's very colorful and  very interesting as each page makes the Big Green Monster go away bit by bit.
B0002KQNJU|5.0|As a young man of 9 or 10 years old there was a TV show that came on Saturday nights at 11:30pm called Creature Features. I would sneak out of bed and go into the living room and watch the old horror classics. The night that this movie came on was one of my best experiences of my childhood. I had never been truly scared by a movie up until that point, but something about this movie got to me that night and it has been my favorite vampire movie every since. Polanski, while I find him personally vile, made a masterpiece of film that has remained largely unknown by most horror fans. It is well worth the money to add this flick to you collection. Especially if the old school Scifi/Horror movies makes you want to stay up late with the lights off and some fresh popcorn.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book literally kept me up all night~something which hasn't happened to me in a while. I thought I'd lost my 'reading mojo,' as someone so cleverly put it, but this book brought it back with a vengeance. I'd heard about it through a fellow book blogger, and so much was the gushing in the review, I had to give it a try. If was I was tired, had a headache, and was gulping down coffee as if my life depended on it the last couple of days, it was because of this book. It was so worth it.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster revolves around the unlikely, crazy, ecstatic, depressing, and sometimes psychotic relationship between Travis Maddox and Abby Abernathy. Travis has never had a problem getting girls, and he's never particularly wanted or needed them (except for a quick romp on his famous couch) until he met one girl who wouldn't give into his reputable charms. (That's how it always happens with guys like that right? They love a girl who won't put up with their crap and sees them for what they are.) However, Abby's not the innocent girl we expect and has a past that she's trying bury, a past that she's reminded of when she's with Travis, giving her contradicting feelings and causing her to constantly second guess their relationship.<br /><br />The intensity of the emotions in this book really put a strain on my nerves and patience, but as a glutton for punishment, I loved every minute of it. Travis and Abby are insane, individually and about each other, but no matter what happens, how big the fight, how impossible it seems, they always come to the conclusion that they belong together. The roller-coaster relationship of theirs is not lacking in love, but they still have a lot of growing to do and obstacles to overcome before they can come to the point where nothing can stop them.<br /><br />In some of the reviews I've read, I've heard there is too much violence, cursing, etc, etc... I thought that's what made this book real. People curse, they are essentially violent, they make huge mistakes, and are sometimes physical about releasing their anger. That's the reality of being human. We can't always control ourselves according to 'civilized' society. Travis's constantly flaring temper is huge part of what makes him who he is, what causes him to be the 'screw up' he believes himself to be, and it's up to Abby to love him anyway. That's what this book is about - loving someone for who they are, not trying to change or save them, but loving them without conditions.<br /><br />I wish I could say this book was an easy and light read - it's anything but that. It's an intense and extremely emotional ride from start to finish. One of the best and most realistic love stories I've ever read.<br /><br />Happy Reading Everyone :)<br /><br />~ Keely ~y make huge mistakes, and are sometimes physical about releasing their anger.

I want to be entertained not 'sent a message' by the author.<br />Collins can't even flush out her characters to a satisfying conclusion because of her obsession with making a point or keeping it real, what a ripoff.<br />Collins glad your getting rich from sending your message but you have gotten the last dollar you'll ever get from me.
1416972242|4.0|Without a doubt, Cassandra Clare knows how to weave a twisted fairy tale into something you just want to wrap around yourself and curl up with for hours. I'm usually a character driven reader, but in this unique and rare case for me, I think I'd have to say the story creates the characters. There are so many unexpected elements, tragedies, emotional spikes, and battles that as soon as you get used to the way you think the story is going, it changes on you and presents a completely different perspective. The storyline is creative, original, and completely open to anything both possible and impossible.<br /><br />I'd love to take a stroll through Clare's magic-filled mind. Her descriptions always leave me wondering, \\"how'd she come up with that?\\" Her imagination seems childlike, but it also adds that tinge of horror that makes what we are reading believable - in that fairytale way, of course. The demons she comes up with are, strangely, one of my favorite aspects. Some of them made me gag - no, really - which they are inevitably supposed to do with their evil intentions and overall nastiness. Disgusting demons aside, the other creatures she depicts, such as the fairies of Seelie Court and the hybrid Downworlders, draw you to this 'other' world, making it seem more real than the 'mundane' world Clary always thought was reality before she discovered the Shadowhunters.<br /><br />The one and only problem I had with the book was Clary. She's not the most unlikable heroine I've ever come across, but her suffering maturity level and unfailing ability to ignorantly force her way into grave situations - on the premise that she wants to 'help' when really she just freezes, screams, and waits for someone to save her - really grated my nerves. However, I do understand that this world is still new to her and that she severely lacks the training that the others possess. I hope her 'helpless female syndrome' subsides as she learns more about herself and her heritage.<br />Now although I did say that I think the storyline steals the show in this book, as a character driven reader, I couldn't help but be entranced by the complexity of the relationship between Jace and Clary. All I'm gunna say is that I don't think Jace is who he thinks he is, and the angst they are causing each other is going to, has to, subside eventually.<br /><br />Happy Reading Everyone :)<br /><br />~ Keely ~ugh I did say that I think the storyline steals the show in this book, as a character driven reader, I couldn't help but be entranced by the complexity of the relationship between Jace and Clary.

B007549YM4|4.0|This movie is a punch in the gut.  There's a scene at the end between Mickey and Sam  that punched a hole in my heart and made me cry.<br /><br />This movie has flaws, and since other reviewers covered them quite well, I won't repeat myself here.<br /><br />Some people don't get it.  It's a movie you have to watch very carefully.  There's a scene between Eva and Sam later in the movie that if you don't catch it, you won't understand why she does what she does later on.  Some reviewers have said the mother does nothing to try to rescue her child.  Did they miss where the soldiers knocked her out, and later, when she tried to open the door?  As for her actions later, the woman has gone quite mad, and gravitated to whom she felt was an alpha male who would respond to her advances (at least that's how I saw it) and protect her.  She was running on instinct, and she was wrong.<br /><br />For people bitching about the \\"Oh teh noes, this movie was sooooo disgusting and awful!\\"  Do you normally watch random movies which might disturb you without doing any research ahead of time?  I think that sometimes people want to be offended.<br /><br />The monsters in this film are us.  It is horror, but it's social horror:  the horror of what humans become when they lose their humanity.<br /><br />The movie isn't gory in the usual sense of blood and guts.  There's some blood, and some dead bodies which have to be disposed of in the only way possible.  This scene isn't shown, but the sounds are obvious, and your mind fills in the rest.  For some, that's far more disturbing than anything graphically shown.<br /><br />Some people also complain that nothing was ever explained.  Well, of course it isn't: how would the characters know what was going on and why?  We don't need to have every little detail spoon-fed to us!  My own theory is that America did it to itself as a 'Wipe the slate clean and blame the terrorists' sort of thing on select cities throughout the US.  Taking the child yet leaving behind Eva lends some truth to this: they were taking the untainted to harvest, which is even more disturbing.<br /><br />If you have a strong constitution and can handle extremely disturbing depictions of madness in the aftermath of a nuclear attack, it's worth it.leaving behind Eva lends some truth to this: they were taking the untainted to harvest, which is even more disturbing.<br /><br />If you have a strong constitution and can handle extremely disturbing depictions of madness in the aftermath of a nuclear attack, it's worth it.

0439023513|1.0|I really loved the first two books and jumped on here to buy the third book in The Hunger Games Trilogy.  I noticed the overall reviews were a lot lower than the other books had received and wondered why.  I glanced at a couple of the reviews but saw they all had spoilers so I stopped trying to read them and just bought the book.  How bad could it be?  Even if it was mediocre, I require that closure...don't you?  So - needless to say, I was very excited to read it.  Ugh.  I won't go into the details - I came back and read a lot of reviews here after the fact - people cover it well enough so I won't rehash.  I just want to write and tell potential purchasers to save your money.  Trust me.  I don't care how much you loved the first two...quit while you are ahead...make up an ending in your own mind.  You would thank me later...but hopefully that won't be happening because you are going to take my advice and not read this third book so you won't know what I saved you from.  No thanks necessary!<br /><br />Seriously - I know most of you will ignore this and then come back later and say you wish you had listened to me.  I'm not one for \\"I told you so's\\" - I just wish I had caught a review like this and somehow it had stopped me from reading this third book.  I am an avid reader and I never write bad reviews but I felt absolutely compelled to save at least one person.  I feel bad doing this because the author gave me such joy in the first and second books...but holy moly...she really missed the bus on this one - huge missed opportunity.  As for the reviewers that say it was realistic and they are veterans or know veterans...and that she was making a point...all I can say is that I am also a veteran and she could have made the point and still written a wonderful book to wrap up the trilogy in a satisfying manner...she has proven she has the skill in previous efforts.  I don't need a fairytale ending.  This one just took so many wrong turns - it was garbage.  Maybe she'll come back and rewrite it one day and fix the trilogy - that would be the right thing to do.  Scrap this book and start all over.  If I was a writer and I saw my readers felt this way...and was able to understand that the unsatisfied readers didn't miss the point...then I would go back and do it again - I would feel like I owed it to them.  Anyway - hopefully you see this in time!
0345803485|5.0|I waited for over a month for this series to come out.  Let's just say I got the books on Friday and i'm already 1/2 way throught the second one and it's only Monday.  Did i mention that each book has about 500 pages? Well worth the wait!  Totally addicting. Drats having to go to work. Can't wait to see how the rest of the series plays out.  This series does have some pretty erotic scenes so it's not for teenagers or the faint of heart.  I'll definitely be keeping this series for my collection and reread them at a later time.
1439152780|5.0|Kate Morton's first two books were good, but with her third, The Distant Hours, she has achieved perfection.  Beautiful lyrical writing, romances that will enthrall, and suspenseful story lines to keep the reader guessing are just some of the reasons this book is one I highly recommend.<br /><br />Set in a run-down castle that has seen better days and shifting from 1941 to the 1990's, the story follows a pair of twin sisters and their younger half sister who are bound by circumstances to never leave their home.  A young British girl, Meredith, is evacuated from London and stays with them during World War II and becomes very attached to the youngest sister.  Fifty years later, Meredith receives a long-delayed letter which upsets her.  Her daughter, Edie, cannot sit quietly by when her mother refuses to divulge the contents of the letter and finds herself at the castle seeking answers to her mother's past.  What she discovers is so much more as a tale of mystery and terror, love and madness, slowly unravels.  There's a madman in the tower, secret passages, and of course, a dark and stormy night at the climax.  Be prepared to be totally captivated!

B004SJ3AXI|4.0|My only reason for a 4* instead of 5* review for this incredibly entertaining application is sometimes the banner ads are a bit obtrusive, meaning they get in a way of a piece of information you might need to see for a particular puzzle that might change your decision on where to aim your bird.  One thing you should know if you have this version and move to the ad-free version - it won't carry over your scores with you, it'll treat it as a new app.  This was frustrating as I was close to clearing a screen of puzzles with 3-stars (on the other hand it was a good excuse to start all over again....)

B000QFW7UA|5.0|Not quite as good as I remember the original as a kid, but still a darn good film in its own right. Soundtrack is retro, classic, and yet so timeless at the same time. I must say that I was genuinely surprised by how well the film actually stood up. It still is fun to watch even as an adult. While it still has some \\"stupid\\" childish middle school kind of things to it the film just works as a whole.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I used this trilogy as an experiment to try out the Kindle App on my iPad. You buy the books here, then activate the Kindle App which finds the purchases and downloads them for reading.  It all worked very well and the books were very easy to read on the iPad.<br /><br />These stories are well written adventures.  Any disjointed qualities are attributed to the youth of the heroine.  Since the stories take place in a later-years, United States, you wonder what happened to the rest of the planet, but aside from issues like that, the plots are well-reasoned and creative, providing a fresh look at humanity and its odd priorities at times.<br /><br />I'll have to see the movie to see how they did.  Some of the costume descriptions alone could have blown the special effects budgets if done to the hilt ;-)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am only half way through this book and am bored senseless. The only thing that I can think of as to why this book is so popular is that these all must be first time readers of this genre. The writing is sub par and the sex scenes barely register on my hot meter. I find Ana the main character to just be so lame. Sorry I wanted to like this book but I am an avid reader and know that there is a lot more out there and way HOTTER then this.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I like this little amp. I use it because im hard of hearing and instead of buying expensive hearing aid headphones that break i tryed this. it makes it louder, bass better, and lessens all the fuzziness that you get with some headphones when you play them full blast. it works great, the batter dies after a few hours, but charges super quick. 5 stars!
1400069289|4.0|Duhigg's book picks apart how habits work (both to help us and hurt us) from multiple angles, illuminatingly and entertainingly. This book looks at habits of individuals, organizations, and whole societies, examining how we form them and how we can change them. Topics include making an exercise habit, breaking a drinking habit, creating a civil rights movement and rescuing a major manufacturing firm from stagnation.<br /><br />In one chapter, he examines how entire companies can form structures of authority and cooperation that either propel them to success or drive them to utter disaster. In another, he describes how small \\"keystone habits\\" can entirely remake a person's life with surprisingly little further effort. A person who starts a regular exercise routine will often get their finances and career in order almost automatically. Alcoa (a major aluminum manufacturer) emerged from a long downward spiral starting simply with an intense focus on employee safety.<br /><br />Duhigg examines the latest neuroscience of habit formation as well as A.A., one of the most successful habit-changing groups in recent history. He looks at what it means to form a habit in the first place, how a habit can be changed (replaced, rather than extinguished, to be precise), and how corporations like Target are seeking to influence your habits.<br /><br />This book covers a lot of ground, and the variety of material he uses to explain these concepts keeps the book deeply involving the whole way through. If you're interested in pscyhology and why we do what we do every day, this is definitely a book for you.

B0028DRGDQ|5.0|Mommy!!! Holy crap, I almost lost my sh-- several times, watching this. [REC] is unsettling stuff, and terrifying and in Spanish. It certainly thunderously redeems the sub-genre of the found footage film. When you see [REC], no need then to see its less satisfying American remake, QUARANTINE, which damningly seems to be a shot-for-shot adaptation. In that lost trove of found footage film, the [REC] franchise and, more recently, CHRONICLE, set themselves apart. I'd even add CLOVERFIELD to that short list, except I don't want my feelings hurt.<br /><br />Paella, Pau Gasol, and [REC] - this is Spain hooking up the rest of the world. See, when done right, the found film footage provides chills that feel more visceral and immediate. [REC] begins in humdrum manner, with a television crew deployed to a local fire station in Barcelona to do a piece on firefighters or, as the Spanish are wont to call them, \\"los bomberos\\" (which sounds cooler). When the firefighters on shift respond to an emergency call, the television crew accompanies them to an apartment tenement in which an elderly woman is screaming non-stop. But a routine call soon spirals out of control when the health authorities arrive to seal off the building, stranding the news team, the firefighters, policemen, and the residents with an undefined menace. But I'll define it... and SPOILER it.... old Mrs. Izquierdo is a zombie.<br /><br />Here's a neat thing: Director of Photography, Pablo Rosso, not only wields the point-of-view camera himself but he also played the role of the in-movie news team's cameraman \\"Pablo.\\" I'll tell you what, it takes some sort of steely fiber for someone to keep hoisting that camera while spooky paranormal shizzy is going down.<br /><br />The plot isn't deep. The narrative is populated by stock characters. That's okay. [REC] overcomes the shackles of its tropes by dint of its vitality and nervy execution and presentation. It's rated R for \\"bloody horror violence and language,\\" but it also should've mentioned the film's knack for inducing nerve-jangling claustrophobia. The building which traps our characters probably looks welcoming and quaint by daylight, but at night and as seen thru the confines of a handheld camera, the environs transmogrify into these disquieting dark and cramped quarters. This frightener takes full advantage of its conceit, of this one camera providing the first person perspective. The most alarming concern becomes not about what's in front of us, but rather the thing that could be waiting to pounce on us just off-camera. That there's no soundtrack at all until the end credits roll bolsters that sense of jagged, stripped-down believability. The third act is relentless in its visceral scares. I had to turn the light on. Those bloodcurdling screams aren't coming from old Mrs. Izquierdo alone.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- The REC \\"Making Of\\" featurette (00:18:29 minutes, with English sub-titles)o should've mentioned the film's knack for inducing nerve-jangling claustrophobia.

0439023513|2.0|First, let me explain that I was not looking for a fairy tale with a \\"happy-ever-after\\" ending as some have suggested to other reviewers. And I found the way the story ended quite good, I felt it fit with what happened in the story, mostly.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the first two books but was very let down by this one. We waited a long time for any action to occur with most of the book feeling simply grey with no color, good or bad. Some of the charactors pretty much flat lined and lost any interest that was generated in the first two books.<br /><br />I felt the story ending was good and brought home the way war changes people and that once those changes occur life goes on, but it's never the same. My problem with the ending was the way it was presented. The action had finally picked up but then suddenly Katniss was pretty much in a coma (or her own personal brain fog) for the last chapters and we only got the rest of the story after the fact in a quick synopsis of \\"this is what happened while you were out of it.\\" When authors do this, and it happens too often, I always feel like they suddenly realized the book might be getting too long and so they tried to wrap up all the loose ends in a neat little package in as few words as possible. Show me the trial and the uproar that occurred as a result of her actions.<br /><br />I agree with some about the way the two men in her life ended up. I don't think she would have lost all interest in the one she didn't end up with or that he would step completely out of her life, either. They shared the war as comrades just as much as she did with the one she ended up with (sorry, a little cryptic, but I don't want to spoil the ending), just in different ways.<br /><br />I'd still recommend reading it just to wrap up the story, but don't expect the same exciting \\"I can't put it down\\" feeling that the first two invoked.
B003HTPHTK|5.0|Very cute and quirky film.  Fun and uplifting!  Brittany Murphy is adorable!  The supporting cast is great too.  Good for a Ladies' movie night.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|I had this game on my aneroid phone and it was fun so when I saw the Kindle Fire Edition on sale today I was happy and bought it but then when I tried to open it I get an error that says not compatible with my device.  crap.  Do not waste your money.
0399159029|4.0|About three quarters of the way through this I was ready to give it five stars, but the ending struck me as contrived, as did a few other aspects of the plot. At one point the villian of this eighth installment of the Bernie Gunther series, Reichsprotector Reinhard Heydrick tells Bernie that he is both clever and an idiot. Clever enough to solve the murder, but an idiot for telling him about it.<br /><br /> That really is my problem with the Gunther character and series. The books rich atmosphere gives you a feel for what it must have been like to try to get through life day to day in Nazi Germany. The series does a better job of that than a recent non-fiction best seller, [[ASIN:030740885X In the Garden of Beasts: Love, Terror, and an American Family in Hitler's Berlin]]does.  And Bernie for the most part is as appealing and honest as a cop can be under the circumstances.<br /><br />  But Bernie is also too insubordinate to be believed. And Kerr has a streak of the pulp novelist in him that often overtakes the plot.  This story includes the \\"femme fatale\\" of the title being water boarded (she is naked, of course) while the villian and Bernie unravel the last mysteries behind the case.<br /><br />  I did mostly enjoy the book, however. It may even be one of the stronger entries in the series. And if you have enjoyed others in the series, you are certain to like this.<br /><br />  It's just that I feel Kerr is close to pulling off something significant in this series, really transcending the genre, and perhaps because he lacks the narrative skills of a Henning Mankell or the moral vision of a John LeCarre, he never quite pulls it off.<br /><br />  Norman Mailer once opined that great writers are invariably on the edge of cliche. I'm not sure Kerr qualifies as a great writer in part because he is so often on the other side of that edge.

630529142X|4.0|Arguably the last of Adam Sandler's string of truly funny character comedies. It's dumb in an earnest and appealing way, with Sandler in his element as the dense, innocent hayseed with tons of peculiar charisma and an aggressively violent streak. He's undeniably the centerpiece of this story, but also isn't afraid to share the screen with the other denizens of this obtuse little world he's populated - a necessity, since a crippling stutter leaves him unable to complete more than a few sentences at a time. Kathy Bates and Henry Winkler unleash their wickedly funny hidden talents in supporting roles as Sandler's sanctimonious, over-protective mother and cowardly savant football coach, respectively. Though the SNL alum would later dip into the well too often, at this point his backup squad of one-note bit characters and bizarre non sequiturs still felt fresh and genuine. Loaded with buried gems and unexpectedly brilliant one-liners, it left me grinning and wiping tears from my eyes in several spots. Much funnier than the absurdly simple concept would lead you to believe.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Multidimensional and thought-provoking, Fifty Shades of Grey is a story that will twist you, bend you and cry for you to submit to its intrigue.<br /><br />Okay, normally I am not one to grab a book that is being \\"hyped up\\" in the media.  However, when Fifty Shades of Grey began to pop up everywhere, the nerd in me came bursting forth and Googled the title.  Yes, I Googled it.  What I found was a very varying and diverse thought spectrum - which is actually a good thing, in my opinion.  It seems that people either loved it or hated it.  Now, what really grabbed me was an article that I read where some psychologist or Dr. of some sort was saying how this book was considered \\"Mommy Porn\\" and that it was a very unhealthy thing for woman.  Um, excuse me?!  It is socially acceptable for men to look at and ogle women/porn online, in bars, in magazines, etc, but if a woman reads something that is even slightly touted as \\"erotic\\" it is unhealthy?!  Let's see - a woman reads and thereby uses her intelligence to  take in the words and has to use her creativity and imagination to bring these images, portrayed within the story, to life for herself and that is unhealthy?  How is this any worse than a person reading murder mysteries, horror stories and anything of violence?  Needless to say, this ticked me off.  I knew right then and there that I had to get the book and read it myself.  Now, to take a step back, people may say \\"How can it be acceptable to allow a man to tie you up, make you eat when he wants, etc?\\"  Well, it is not.  However, if there are two consenting adults and they get their kicks that way - well, let them go forth and dom/sub.  I do want to say, however, that these issues were blown waaaay out of proportion with this book.  There is no where near the type of dominance that some say is so horrible and demeaning to women (and for the record, there are books out there were the men are the submissive - it is fictional entertainment after all) within Fifty Shades of Grey.  Okay, on with the review of the actual book.<br /><br />For me, Fifty Shades of Grey was a great look into the psyche of a man who grew up with a tortured start to life.  He learns to cope in life with strong walls and a hard shell built around himself.  He does not allow himself to become close to any one person and relationships with woman are something to enjoy physically and devoid of emotions.  So far within his life, he has been able to keep things going at this level.  That all changes, however, when he meets Anastasia (Ana).  For Christian, Ana is unlike any other woman he has ever met before.  She is not only beautiful and intelligence, she is innocence and strength.  Ana does not bend over backwards for Christian and she knows her own mind and morals.  I want to mention that this is something that pleasantly surprised me.  When I first read about this book, I had pictured Ana as a very submissive person who would be, more or less, a puppet on a string.  I was not thrilled with this idea, however I pushed it aside as I began to read.  Ana is not at all like my preconceived notions.  Nor, for that matter, was Christian the jerk, dominant \\"I am man, do as I say\\" type of character that I had thought he would be.<br /><br />I fully believe that the reader will get out of Fifty Shades of Grey what they put into it.  I have heard, repeatedly, about the hot sex, the bondage, etc of this book.  Yes, there is sex.  Yes it is steamier than Harlequin, however it is not nearly as sexually explicit as some erotica books out on the market.  There is one scene of slight violence, however it was handled in a way that truly lent to the book.  I am not going to go into this any further because I do not want to give anything away.  As far as bondage?  Slight.  Being controlling?  Slight.  An actual story of love?  Yes.  A story that goes deeper than sex?  Absolutely yes.<br /><br />Going in, I really had no expectation for Fifty Shades of Grey.  I was neutral and curious.  This is what I took from it:<br /><br />Christian is an amazing character.  He has some major issues that began at a very early age, which have damaged him deeply.  He has a need for control on a psychological level that goes beyond machismo.  He doesn't feel the need for control for a shallow reason, but one to survive.  He is a lost soul who needs to find salvation.<br /><br />Ana is a young innocent college grad.  She has the world in front of her.  Ana has also never felt the need or desire for a physical relationship with a man.  That all changes, however, when she inadvertently meets Christian.  Her world spins in a way she worries she will lose control of, but manages not to drown in.<br /><br />Together, Christian and Ana battle emotional demons as the sparks of heady chemistry roars between them.  For Christian, Ana presents many \\"firsts\\", which both surprise and scare him.  For reasons beyond him, Ana is different and reaches into him unlike anyone he has ever met before.  Ana battles her sub-conscience and \\"inner goddess\\" to figure out what is right for her and how far she is willing to let herself stretch for Christian.<br /><br />I truly adored both of these characters.  They came to life in an amazing way for me and truly made me care for both of them - particularly Christian.  A bit of food for thought:  Christian asks that Ana's hands (or whomever he is having a relationship with) to be bound during sex.  His biggest fear?  To have his chest touched.  Connection?  See, for me, the bondage issue went way beyond kinky sex.<br /><br />In any case, I really enjoyed Fifty Shades of Grey.  I can't wait to continue with the trilogy to delve deeper into Christian's past and discover the demons that have tortuously branded him.  I anxiously look forward to seeing how the lives of both Ana and Christian unfold.  For me, this was a story of two lives who deeply connect and love one another.  One of those people unable to form a healthy and \\"normal\\" relationship, nor ever had the desire to, until now.  This was a story of strength, demons, trust and faith.  It was not a story of sex.<br /><br />I do want to mention that the story was not perfect for me.  The writing was very good, however many times the author would pop in words that seemed out of place within the story.  The words would be the type of words not normally used in every day conversation (at least for me) and would break up the flow of the story for me a bit.  Some examples?  Infinitesimally, envisages, medulla oblongata (ex: And from a very tiny, underused part of my brain - probably located at the base of my medulla oblongata where my subconscious dwells - comes the thought:), and there are others throughout, these are just a few that stood out.  E.L. James does use amazing word visualization and easily drew me into the story and the scenes.  When the scenes were sizzling, they were hot, when the scenes were emotionally tortured, they were very heart-tugging and when the scenes were sweet, they were heart-melting.  All-in-all, Fifty Shades of Grey is a wonderful book and one that I highly recommend - not because it is so media \\"hyped\\" but because it is a wonderful story - just please do not read it simply for the sex, but delve into the complex emotional and psychological aspects of the story.  And for the record - I have heard this being dubbed the \\"dirty Twilight\\" books.  Honestly?  Other than a tortured male character and an innocent female character - there is absolutely no similarities - at least none that I could find.urious.  This is what I took from it:<br /><br />Christian is an amazing character.  He has some major issues that began at a very early age, which have damaged him deeply.  He has a need for control on a psychological level that goes beyond machismo.  He doesn't feel the need for control for a shallow reason, but one to survive.  He is a lost soul who needs to find salvation.<br /><br />Ana is a young innocent college grad.  She has the world in front of her.  Ana has also never felt the need or desire for a physical relationship with a man.  That all changes, however, when she inadvertently meets Christian.  Her world spins in a way she worries she will lose control of, but manages not to drown in.<br /><br />Together, Christian and Ana battle emotional demons as the sparks of heady chemistry roars between them.  For Christian, Ana presents many \\"firsts\\", which both surprise and scare him.  For reasons beyond him, Ana is different and reaches into him unlike anyone he has ever met before.  Ana battles her sub-conscience and \\"inner goddess\\" to figure out what is right for her and how far she is willing to let herself stretch for Christian.<br /><br />I truly adored both of these characters.  They came to life in an amazing way for me and truly made me care for both of them - particularly Christian.  A bit of food for thought:  Christian asks that Ana's hands (or whomever he is having a relationship with) to be bound during sex.  His biggest fear?  To have his chest touched.  Connection?  See, for me, the bondage issue went way beyond kinky sex.<br /><br />In any case, I really enjoyed Fifty Shades of Grey.  I can't wait to continue with the trilogy to delve deeper into Christian's past and discover the demons that have tortuously branded him.  I anxiously look forward to seeing how the lives of both Ana and Christian unfold.  For me, this was a story of two lives who deeply connect and love one another.  One of those people unable to form a healthy and \\"normal\\" relationship, nor ever had the desire to, until now.  This was a story of strength, demons, trust and faith.  It was not a story of sex.<br /><br />I do want to mention that the story was not perfect for me.  The writing was very good, however many times the author would pop in words that seemed out of place within the story.  The words would be the type of words not normally used in every day conversation (at least for me) and would break up the flow of the story for me a bit.  Some examples?

B002ZB26AO|5.0|I've been trying to learn all that I can about North Korea in order to educate myself and my children. I will never pretend to comprehend or truly understand what life is like there; but I believe Demick accomplished what she set out to do: to tell the stories of everyday life for North Korean defectors, particularly during the 1990's famine, how they survived, in what conditions, and their subsequent escape. They are stories of survival and above all else, hope. There is young love, old love, lost love, pain, suffering, joy and sadness. The will to live and the ability to withstand so much hardship and sorrow is beyond anything I can fathom. I simply cannot wrap my head around the courage it would take to risk everything you've ever known and escape to a world you know nothing about; all the while knowing at any minute you could be captured and sent to a labor camp for who know's how long, or worse, executed. Sadly, most stories of North Korean defector's don't end \\"happily ever after,\\" as we all like to assume. Most struggle to adjust; the guilt, shame, lonliness, worry for family left behind, all can sabotage any happiness or contentment they had hoped to find. Chol-hwan Kang, a North Korean defector, labor camp survivor and author of his memoir, \\"The Aquariums of Pyongyang\\", said in an interview: \\"Many people don't understand North Korea and the mentality of the defectors.\\" It's just hard to understand how this is still going on in the 21st Century!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Great game but I was thru it in no time. Patiently waiting for updates. Played on a HTC Hero S.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I recommend this book to all who love the Hunger Games. All three books were attention getting amd I had a hard time putting it down. I felt as if I was there with the characters.
0345803485|5.0|I'm not one to jump on the bandwagon of whatever's popular at any given moment - I haven't read the Twilight, Harry Potter or The Hunger Games books.  I read an article about Fifty Shades of Grey in a magazine and kept hearing more and more about it, so I thought \\"what the heck?\\" and picked up a copy.  In spite of myself, I absolutely could NOT put this book down and finished it in a day.  Yep, the writing is borderline awful and yes, it's a completely unrealistic storyline, but I think EL James did a great job of crafting characters and a story that leaves you wanting more.  Not every book has to be a literary masterpiece and this certainly isn't....but it's great escapism.  Despite the fact that it's highly unlikely someone like Christian would fall for someone like Ana, when you get down to it, I thought she painted a somewhat realistic picture of the beginnings of a relationship - the misunderstandings, the getting-to-know-you moments, the \\"will he or won't he commit\\" questions, the unsure-ness of it all and that feeling that you just can't get enough of someone - I think it's something we can all relate to. And yeah, when you first meet someone and have that physical attraction and chemistry, you have sex.  LOTS OF IT!  No, not many of us snag a super hot gazillionaire dominant who buys us Audi's and flies us to their penthouse apartment in their private helicopter, but I'm sure many of us have experiences falling for someone that has big issues, a bad childhood, a past they aren't proud of, a \\"bad boy\\" etc. and we, as women, have that natural tendency to want to \\"fix\\" that person (admit it, ladies!).  What kept me reading was really wanting to find out what's up with Christian, what happened in his past to make him so jacked up and how in the heck these 2 could stay together.  The first book doesn't answer all of these questions - so of course the minute I finished, I beat a path to my nearest bookstore and bought the other 2 books in the series.  If you wanta great escape - I highly recommend this series.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|This app is super fun. Not too hard that you quit and not too easy that it is boring. Sometimes you need creativity sometimes just good timing. Beat all 100 levels and very sad it is over!! Get this app!
0345803493|5.0|This is book 2 in the Fifty Shades trilogy and may have actually been my favorite of the 3.  The first book ends with Ana leaving Christian because of his BDSM lifestyle.  The first several pages concentrate on Ana's grief as she tries to get over Christian.  It's relatable - when you break up with the love of your life, you do spend days crying, obsessing, trying to figure out how to put yourself in their presence so they can see what they're missing. As Ana and Christian reunite, they both begin to change and begin to mold into more of what the other person wants, but not in a way that compromises them in bad ways, necessarily.  We also find out more and more about Christian's past as he and Ana find themselves testing each other's limits - both sexual and otherwise.  This book also introduces us to Ana's creepy new boss, Jack, which helps to set up a (yes, unrealistic) storyline that weaves its way through the rest of this book and the 3rd. Again, the writing isn't up there with any of the literary greats, but it's a page turner and it's a great escape. The secondary characters become a larger part of this book (is it just me, or does anyone else picture Taylor looking like some kind of Jason Bourne?) and that can become tiresome as can Ana's pain-in-the-butt, defiant attitude that puts her directly in danger.  Overall, though, I loved these books and would recommend them to anyone wanting a few hours of escapism!
B0058VW36U|1.0|it wont download evebln though I paid for it. It keeps saying &quot;error while downloading&quot;. even when I reset my kindle the same message pops up. please fix
0345803507|5.0|I read all 3 Fifty Shades books within the span of a week, so I've been completely engrossed and now feel a little lost! What to do with my time? :-) I loved this series. This book follows Ana and Christian after their marriage. I have to say I was a little let down that we didn't get more detail leading up to the wedding (given the detail James went into for other, less important parts of the story) but you do get to see a bit in flashbacks. Clearly James has covered all of the \\"female-fantasy-bases\\" and has thrown them into this book - lavish wedding? check! 3-week European honeymoon on a private yacht? CHECK! Expensive gifts, including yet another new car, jewelry, a mansion w/unlimited funds to refurbish it, mind-blowing \\"adult relations\\", a house in Aspen, Christian's ability to buy Ana's company, allowing her to have her dream job, designer clothes/shoes, a husband (or at least his security staff) who saves the day on more than one occasion, her best friend marrying husband's brother, great in-laws who adore her...seriously, there's something for everyone! I could have done without the Jack Hyde storyline because it added an extra element of creepiness and a totally unbelievable scene about Ana \\"saving\\" her sister in law - but why quibble with that minor detail?<br /><br />It finally occurred to me while reading this book why this was (as my husband so eloquently put it) \\"chick p*rn\\". It wasn't just the steamy scenes or all of the materialistic things mentioned above. It's because Ana accomplishes something that many women have strived (and most likely failed) to do at one time or another - take a totally jacked up person and \\"fix them\\". Ana is able to do this - to get Christian to leave his sordid past behind, to convince him that he's not a horrible human being, to bring him out of himself, to break through his barriers and insecurities - to be the person who \\"fixes him\\" when no amount of therapy or (adoptive) parental love could do that. Totally unrealistic, yes - but definitely grounded in reality.<br /><br />I was also really happy that there was an epilogue told from Christian's POV, but all it did was leave me wanting more. If there was one thing that would have made this book better, it would have been to tell the story from both POV's. I know the point was to learn about Christian as he reveals himself to Ana, but I wanted to know more about his work, his past and what was going through his mind as events unfolded.<br /><br />All in all, if you want a totally engrossing trilogy, can suspend belief and don't mind the less-than-masterful prose, choose this one!
B004EPYZV2|4.0|So that everyone knows:  Amazon lists the aspect ratio for the Blu-Ray product as 1.85:1.  This is incorrect.  The Blu-Ray edition is framed in a 2.4:1 aspect.  The video is exceptional.  The movie plot by itself would only get 3 stars from me, but the Blu-Ray video and audio experience brings this to 4 stars.

B0064BWDRW|5.0|I had mixed feelings about reading this book! I couldn't wait to read the next chapter, but I knew it was taking me closer to the end and I didn't want it to end...

B000OVLBGC|5.0|Outstanding performances by all concerned. I admit to being a little confused right at the beginning but I stayed with it & was not disappointed. Ulrich Muhe was brilliant, his expressions alone told the story of his unfolding compassion, an emotion one would have thought he was incapable of. At the beginning I kept thinking what a nasty little man he was, & at the end I loved him. As previously recommended, watch the special features for more insight into this wonderful film, plus the actors actual experiences during the time of the Stasi in East Germany.

0802130208|3.0|Ignatius J. Reilly is a memorable character, from the twitching vibrassae of his nostrils when exposed to Paradise Hot Dogs, to his large paws and quirky valve, and don't forget his unusually large sense of entitlement.  Oh My God!  you won't easily forget him or his green hunting cap wandering around N'Orleans.<br /><br />The problem is exposition:  the author rarely moves events quickly, and Ignatius gets caught up in writing pages of \\"A Working Boy\\" that are literally pages as paragraphs, glazing the reader's eyes.  His mother is shrewish, his girlfriend absent, and the other people around Ignatius are as dysfunctional as him in various ways.<br /><br />I think the book only garnered a Pulitzer because the author was already dead.  I admit to enjoying about 50 pages of truly ridiculous antics, but the rest of this 400 page softcover was a great slog though pseudo-morality and vitriolic diatribes, not to mention the accents on several characters.  I'm not sure what purpose the book served other than a study of characters in desolation (a vibe I don't enjoy), but it certainly was not 'hilarious'.  Also, I wanted to read about Igatius's wedding with Myrna... it seemed those two deserved each other, but the book ended without it.<br /><br />Ah well, I still smile a little at Igantius demanding another Dr. Nut while bedeviling his drunkard of a mother.  I think I'd have enjoyed the story more if the author concentrated on only one ridiculous character instead of writing a confederacy of them.  Three stars because I don't believe I'll ever want to slog through this again, and I didn't enjoy the diatribes or accents.

1609611543|4.0|Read this book on my Kindle and was fully engrossed. It was extremely thorough in the explanations of modern hybridized wheat and its detriment to the human digestive and other systems. It's quite frightening to learn how science consistently stays ahead of public knowledge and this book does a great job of explaining the history of wheat in our culture and its links (along with all processed foods) to the obesity problems in America. Overall I really enjoyed the book but I did find myself skimming some of the highly scientific explanations of things. Perhaps that makes me shallow, but I am not a scientist and could have done without a few of the more involved explanations.<br /><br />Like other readers, I thought the argument against modern genetically altered wheat was sound and convincing, but the dietary suggestions without explanation to get rid of other carb replacements such as gluten free products is more than I can handle. If it really is the modern, genetically altered wheat grain that is the problem, why should I give up rice, corn and potatoes? I wish the author had done glycemic level studies on the other carbs to compare before summarily suggesting giving them up.<br /><br />Nonetheless, my family intends to try this for one month once we've depleted the cupboards of the nasty wheat products we love this month (we are gradually phasing things out, rather than spontaneously purging everything for financial and mental health reasons...). I am hoping this works on my husband's psoriasis and wheat belly!
B003QTSMXE|5.0|This film is perfect for all ages, but it does have some parts that might be emotionally troubling for children due to the seriousness of the scene, such as when Wall-E is badly injured.<br /><br />While watching this film, my emotions ranged from laughing to crying and I was awestruck by the detail of the scenes. You can tell that the production quality was a high priority when \\"Wall-E\\" was in development. Even though there isn't much in the way of dialogue from any of the robots, what was said seemed appropriate and well-scripted.<br /><br />Wall-E has the curiosity and playfulness of a child, yet was also quite lonely which explains his quick fascination with Eve. His antics while trying to win her heart reminded me of my own youth as I stumbled-around trying to win the affections of whatever girl I was interested in at the time. I wasn't as bad-off as Wall-E, but I have to admit that I was rooting for him.<br /><br />\\"Wall-E\\" is an absolutely beautiful movie which I have already watched several times since renting it yesterday and I will be buying my digital copy in the future.

'file-that...' 'slash-this..' 'slash-that...'<br />jargon at you.<br /><br />'Consulted oodles of books to make sense of all the various concepts and build<br />my mental UNIX knowledge tree....alas with mixed success...just when you thought<br />you understood...came along another surprise...\\"Uhm...well its not quite like that ...\\"<br /><br />Until I came along this title. Simply put the author 'knows' what he is talking<br />about ...Not only that....the author 'knows' HOW to impart that knowledge to you<br />the reader and finally and most importantly ...<br />...the author must have had the burning desire to impart his knowledge to teach<br />and to hold nothing back...no secrets...no caveats.<br /><br />Everything worthy of knowing about programming 'NIXes and LINUX in particular is<br />summarized in this work as best as would be humanly possible.<br /><br />What is nice about this tome is that it doesn't stop there, it actually takes<br />you under the hood and shows all the secret ins and outs and details the kind of<br />`implied` know-how that makes UNIX and LINUX experts look like masters of the<br />black art of UNIX magic.<br /><br />In short to continue borrowing metaphors from the world of Magic, Michael Kerrisk<br />might have broken a Tapu ( by revealing all the trade secrets ) and made himself `unpopular`<br />within the trade...( just kidding! )<br /><br />I read quitea few books on the internals of the LINUX kernel, some better<br />than others BUT I was surprised to find in this book answers to the many questions<br />I had about the kernel space side of 'NIXes and LINUX in particular.<br /><br />That was not what I was looking for when buying and reading this book.<br />I was simply looking for a reference to help me with the task of writing software for<br />an embedded application, BUT surprisingly, along the way I finally got to build my<br />own mental UNIX / LINUX knowledge tree.<br /><br />Like for example<br />  * what those 'fd' are really about...<br />  * how and ( more importantly ) why 'open()', 'read()' and other file-IO calls<br />  behave differently in various situations and with various drivers and the<br />  semantics that goes with their use in these situations.<br />  * all the details about i-nodes and what they do in a file system.<br />  * the user-space kernel-space split even down to the assembly level details of<br />  entering the kernel-space and leaving it again during a system call.<br />  * .....<br />  * .....<br /><br />It's all there and more....all presented with a didactic prowess and quality that<br />is typical of this book throughout. Michael Kerrisk wants to make sure that you<br />understand and that you have a minimal number of surprises and gotchas on your way<br />to learning the nuts and bolts of a 'NIX box.<br /><br />Things like inserting a little note, warning readers on how to verify the author's<br />explanations on the differences of 'read' versus 'execute' permissions on<br />directories...sorry Mr. Kerrisk I had to find out the hard way 'cause I didn't<br />read or look carefully enough otherwise you were telling me that:<br /><br />  \\"If experimenting to verify the operation of the directory read permission bit,<br />  be aware that some Linux distributions alias the ls command to include flags<br />  (e.g., -F) that require access to i-node information for files in the directory....\\"<br /><br />All in all a great book. There are of course some minor issues such as typos etc.<br />but I'm going to assume a 7 star rating and deduce two stars for the typos so that<br />the result is the 5 stars above.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely loved this trilogy.  The character of Christian grey is the type of aggressive self possessed intelligent man who knows exactly what he wants and how to get it.

B007UMLE5Q|5.0|\\" It might have been the country that made Coe cry, killing him with its silence and loneliness. Making everything ordinary too beautiful to bear. - Ken<br /><br />Don doing a superman and fixing the sink and being more open with people was kind of sweet. It was nice to see Ken writing stories in spite of people sabotaging him. I was hoping for the longest time they would do a ' Ken ' episode. ( Now if they could do one on Cooper that would be an episode not to miss ) I write at night and could relate . The elevator scene with Pete sobbing like a child and a mute uncomfortable Don said volumes about who both men are.The Beethoven score at the closing and the symbolism of Pete and the great maestro was a great addition. Both talented , but haunted by some mysterious ghost. WHY Pete is so suicidal one minute and condescending the next ? Is he bi - polar ? Is trudy really mean when people aren't looking ? He wants for nothing, never has why is he so miserable ? Hope Mr. W and CO probes into that.

0345803485|1.0|Please folks, don't confuse \\"popular\\" and \\"controversial\\" for competent or enjoyable. This book is neither. The writing, character development, and story line are so poor it's maddening. I am ashamed (yes, ashamed) that I bought into the hype and paid money for this book. I'm at 13% on my Kindle and I literally cannot take any more. I am a 26 year old female - I'm within the target demographic. I assume, however, that the author/publishers believe that this demographic has little interest in decent writing, interesting characters, or a plot that is not sickeningly predictable. Maybe most people truly do have little interest in these literary virtues - I am not one of them.

Jun Do even sounds like John Doe.<br /><br />After the orphanage is devastated, Jun Do is sent to the military where first he undertakes training in zero-light combat in the tunnels under the demilitarized zone, and then on an undercover mission which involves kidnapping Japanese from the beaches. And then, Jun Do is sent to language school to learn English, which gets him assigned to a boat to transcribe radio intercepts. Once back on land, he is assigned to an intelligence team travelling to Texas where he meets a Senator and his wife.<br /><br />`There's no way around it: to get a new life, you've got to trade in your old one.'<br /><br />After returning from Texas, Jun Do ends up in a labour camp where he takes over the life and identity of a North Korean military hero, Commander Ga. In this half of the novel, the depiction of North Korea may exceed a reader's wildest imaginings. `The Dear Leader' Kim Jong-il, who died shortly before this book was published, is Commander Ga's rival for the affections of Commander Ga's wife, an actress named Sun Moon.<br /><br />It's complicated, and convoluted and doesn't always make sense. It's jarring at times to switch from the omniscient narrator who tells the `real' story, to the ever-present loudspeakers that tell the version of the story the government wants its citizens to hear and then, in the second half of the novel, to include the interrogator whose responsibility is to make sure that every citizen's story is told. In the end, after most of the pieces fall into place, Pak Jun Do does really become a hero - but not an official North Korean one. I'm ambivalent about setting a dystopian novel in a country where fiction can easily be read as fact but, in the end, it's that blurring of possibility that makes this novel such a powerful read. It's satirical and sad, as well as amusing and unsettling.<br /><br />`What are you going to believe, citizens? Rumours and lies, or your very own eyes?'<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smithme a hero - but not an official North Korean one.

B006OB3K56|4.0|\\"Shame\\" features a pair of stunning performances from Michael Fassbinder and Carey Mulligan as a damaged brother and sister with their own way of coping with emotional damage. So why not five stars? Although I liked this movie quite a bit especially Fassbinger's amazing performance (no pun intended), it's not something I would watch more than once or twice. \\"Shame\\" is both a powerful and harrowing experience and it's not something I'm likely to return to simply for entertainment value although co-writer and director Steve McQueen creates an amazingly powerful minimalist drama.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />Fassbinger plays Brandon a sex addict who's life is turned upside down by the unexpected arrival of his sister Sissy (Mulligan)who has issues of her own. Brandon is unable to connect emotionally with anyone and uses sex to feel...anything with anyone.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />A graphic and emotionally powerful film \\"Shame\\" won't be for everyone (be warned that there is quite a bit of nudity in the film and scenes where the characters are--not surprisingly--having sex). Fassinberg gives a stunning performance making Brandon surprisingly likeable and appealing despite his cold, disconnected nature. It's clear why woman like him--he's charming and notices small details about them but it's also clear that even though Brandon wouldn't admit it, he has a self loathing which prevents him from developing any sort of relationship with anyone beyond the purely physical (and even then only for one night stands).<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks positively stunning with a nice audio mix although most of the activity is in the front speakers (there is a fair amount of ambient activity in the rear).<br /><br />The special features (if it matters to you)are limited to a series of brief featurettes.<br /><br />\\"Focus on Michael Fassbender\\",  \\"Director Steve McQueen\\",\\"The Story of Shame\\", \\"In A Shared Vision\\", \\" Fox Movie Channel Presents: In Character with Michael Fassbender\\" and film's theatrical trailer (1:47/HD) as well as previews. Most of the featurettes run around 3 minutes or so. A commentary track by the director and actors would have been interesting and welcome.<br /><br />There's also a digital copy (Edit: This film is available on itunes to buy) as well as DVD.<br /><br />I'd suggest renting rather \\"Shame\\" first before making the committment to buy it and see if it is your type of movie (and to see if it's one you'll want to watch more than one time). The film deserved much of its praise and director McQueen's stark, minimalist direction compliments the direct performances in the film.sbender\\" and film's theatrical trailer (1:47/HD) as well as previews.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I liked the series; however i think that there are definitely better books out there. I would highly suggest The girl with the dragon tattoo and that entire series. The writings better in that series.

0345803485|1.0|I just started this book today and I will stop reading it today.  It's horrible.  The writing is terrible.  Anastasia's subconscious is boring and it's ridiculous.  Glad I didn't buy the trilogy.
0446547603|5.0|Nicholas Sparks never disappoints me! I am a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks. There isn't a book that he has written that I haven't loved or has not made me cry. And his movies are almost as good as his books too.<br /><br />Well in this book, we have a poor damsel in distress Katie. Katie had to escape her home and ended up in Southport, North Carolina. Where she searched to begin her life over again. A new life, a new her. A new home. A new job. She kept to herself and had her guards up with everything and everyone around her. But a new neighbor moved into the house next to hers and quickly became friends with Katie.She was there for her and encouraged her to do things she felt insecure about.<br /><br />So as Katie continues to open herself up and let her guards down, she meets a local store owner named Alex. Alex is a former military personnel and notices things about Katie not many people would. He notices Katie has secrets but only in time will they be revealed. As they became friends and things began to unfold, they started to fall in love with each other. But Katie wasn't ready to reveal her past and wasn't sure about what the future has in store for her. With this confusion she turns to her \\"new\\" friend Jo and Jo encouraged her to continue to pursue what she feels in heart to be there for him and he was with her. As further events unfolds, these events can either push them together or pull them apart.<br /><br />This story draw me in the minute I opened the book. I couldn't put it down. Nicholas Sparks has a way of words that can captivate you and pull you into the story. I found myself rooting for Alex and Katie and hoping for the best for them. He also had me curious about Jo. \\"Safe Haven\\" is a 5 out of 5 stars! I see myself reading it again to make sure I didn't miss something. It's definitely a \\"Good Choice for Reading!\\" Go out and get it! You will NOT be disappointed!<br /><br />[...]

B004T6IBNY|5.0|this app is great! And the best part is that the other version is free! But to be honest the premium is like $2.00. but that the only stupid part. But other than that this is an awesome app !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Good game!! reminds me of super Mario brothers ya know but with a lepercaun!! download it you will like it!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought the Wool stories individually rather than the Omnibus and loved each one.  This is a great series and worth much more than the price of admission.  I'm so glad there are more Silo stories coming after this one.  This is great science fiction and great writing.
B0076NAWWA|5.0|I absolutely love this CD!!! I think most would like it a lot and lot us will love it. Diverse, refreshing, inspired, and original compared to most of what passes for rock on the radio. Steve Morse plays some of the most memorable solos I've heard in far too long. Casey is an awesome singer, very emotive and diverse also. Mike Portney smokes on the drums. He's on fire, restrained when needed and delivers the bombardment (and finesse) when required. And what can you say about Dave Larue--top of his game and one grooving and rocking bass player. I am fairly new to Neal Morse, but was not let down. What a stellar recording. This should be played wide and far.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Downloaded and loved it the first time.  Then it would start up go to the in game loading screen right before a mission andsit there.  I uninstalled and will see how it goes.  Overall it is a great game. Fun and challenging.  Best of all you can play the game without having to spend real money to progress.  However there is some grinding involved.  Great game.  Would be five stars if it weren't for the loading issue.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Its very similar to a game called Forest Defense on the iphone.  Simple sidescroll defence with easy to use controls and great visuals.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Ok - I am a little late to the party - but after watching my kids fly through this book, I had to find out<br />what they liked so much about it.<br /><br />It is a real page-turner - that is for sure.  With a strong female character at the helm -<br />I am delighted to have it the #1 film for several weeks running.<br /><br />On to Book #2!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it is a great pass time and it is more fast paeced and easy to understand. I enjoy the hunting and fishing aspect of the game the most.
B00634GHJA|2.0|Simple program, it works. However, its not really sending pics to your PC, you have to decide what pics, then shlep to the PC, open a browser, and retrieve them from an ever changing webpage.<br /><br />Its a very hacky way of doing things considering other apps not only send your pics to PC using only your android, but send other files, documents, etc. Best of all, most of those apps are free. Even dropbox is free and does what this app does basically, with many more features.
B000G75AE8|5.0|Slayer put out their best 3 albums in a row (Reign In Blood, South Of Heaven, and Seasons In The Abyss) and their albums will always be held up by those standards no matter how great of an album they put out. With that said, Christ Illusion is nowhere near the masterpiece that RIN, SOH, or SITA were but it is a classic nonetheless.<br /><br />Christ Illusion is pure thrash! Unlike the previous album, God Hates us all there are no weak songs. No experiments in corny metal. Just thrash and speed metal with a hint of hardcore punk. Every song succeeds in ripping your intestines out and pulverizing your skull. However, generic thrash its not. Try the opening riff to Jihad and the heavy grooves thrown into most of the songs. The music itself, like Slayer's best work, manages to creep into your psyche and stay in your head throughout the day. The vocals and hooks are equally catchy.<br /><br />I read some reviews where people were calling the lyrics juvenile for singing in protest to religion and war and for conjuring up Satanism. All I have to say to that is - dude, its Slayer! What do you expect? Go listen to Phil Collins is that offends you ot Styper or something. Haha. Also organized religion and war are as big of a problem as they've ever been. It'd be really naïve to think otherwise. Look at the world we live in. Are you blind? If you find these topics or views offensive then that proves that we bands like this more than ever!<br /><br />My only criticism is that some of the riffs are derivative of earlier songs. That's not to say these are uninspired. Quite the opposite. This is extremely energetic. Its no Reign In Blood but its classic Slayer. Buy this.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|I am do glad I only paid .49 Cents for this game. The purchase for this game went through and wont even bother to download. Explictive words would be used if I weren't as pathetic as Gameloft. What an absolute complete and total waste of time...
B005HEQAJO|5.0|Star Trek TNG is always great, but this episode is superb, even if it's a little derivative of a certain action movie that came out a year or two before. Data is hilarious, Riker is handsomely bearded, and John Luc pulls off a great John McClain.
B00634GHJA|2.0|Why would anyone use this? I can take a picture and send it to any device anyway, without a special app. Seems dumb. Its like &quot;hey check out this app, it lets you make a phone call.&quot;
B006PTL1QM|3.0|by Ilene Serlin, Ph.D.<br /><br />Film Review: A Dangerous Method--A Woman's Perspective<br />Published on January 24, 2012 by Ilene A. Serlin , Ph.D. in Make Your Life a Blessing<br />There are many ways to review this film, both professional and personal. Let me start with the personal first, since I have strong feelings about it.<br /><br />For many years, I have been intrigued by Sabina Spielrein, a woman pioneer of psychoanalysis. My own life, though nothing like hers, has led me into adventures with exotic locations, studies, or high-power, charismatic men. Consequently, I have maintained an informal and formal fascination with women like Sabina Spielrein and questions about their lives; I attended a seminar on her at the Jung Institute, read A Secret Symmetry: Sabina Spielrein Between Freud and Jung, and A Most Dangerous Method, one of her articles, designed and taught a course on Women and Narrative, and published articles: \\"The Anne Sexton Complex\\", \\"A Tribute to Laura Perls\\", \\"Dancing Women's Freedom: the Story of Isadora Duncan\\", and tributes to other women in psychology and the arts. I am a Fellow of the Society for Women in Psychology (Div. 35) of the American Psychological Association. The women in my reading list included biographies of women who were muses to famous men (Rodin, Picasso), wives of famous men (the Beat poets, Scott Fitzgerald). Most of these women either self-destructed (Marilyn Monroe) or were hospitalized by their husbands (T.S. Eliot). The women who survived were writers who advocated having a \\"room of one's own\\" and an \\"independent income\\" (Virginia Woolf, Vita Sackville-West), left a man's world (Carolyn Heilbrun left Columbia), capitalized on their experiences (Francoise Gilot), or were lesbian or bisexual (Diane diPrima). In other words, sex between men and women can be a powerful drug-profound, uplifting, creative and destructive.<br /><br />Next, since I did my pre-doctoral internship at the C. G. Jung Institute and taught atthe institute in Zurich, I have been also fascinated by the personality and legends around Carl Jung. Being involved and interested in cases of erotic countertransference (as an analysand and a supervisor), I read Jungian analyst Robert Stein's Incest and Human Love, and consulted with Mario Jacoby; in short, the boundary issues among Jungian psychoanalysts were (in)famous and fairly widespread, often with elaborate rationalizations for why boundary crossing was permissible. I also heard more stories about how both male and female lay analysts were trained by being in analysis with Jung (or Freud) and one of the inner circle; incest was part of the excitement. I found the book, Jung's Circle of Women: The Valkyries. Finally, I met with Aniela Jaffe, Jung's personal secretary whom, legend had it, was one of the few heterosexual women who had not slept with Jung.<br /><br />Aniela Jaffe, blind and almost 90 years old at the time, took my hand, pronounced it strong, and advised me to \\"have the courage to lead an unconventional life.\\" She told me that she tried marriage for 6 years, found it not for her, and preferred to live like a graduate student in a simple, book-lined apartment in Zurich. I identified with her-she, a well-educated Jewish upper middle-class woman from Berlin; me, a well-educated Jewish woman from New York (Russian heritage), Sabina Spielrein, a well-educated Jewish Russian woman living in Zurich and Vienna, and Toni Wolff, Jung's next long-time mistress, a Jewish or half-Jewish former patient and originator of some of his theories of the occult.<br /><br />An unconventional life or marriage? This is one question that has haunted me for a long time. My role models, including Simone de Beauvoir, said that it made women property and advocated personal and professional liberation. Modern women ask these questions, some of which I reviewed for PsycCritiques covering Elizabeth Gilbert's Committed: A Skeptic Makes Peace with Marriage.<br /><br />In her real life, Sabina Spielrein, as she got mentally stronger, thought that she should have her own man and family. She married a fellow Russian Jewish medical student, had two children, but was reportedly soon bored. She left Vienna and moved back to Rostov-on-Don with her family. Although she accomplished much--she was responsible for the contact and collaboration between Jung and Freud and did try to keep them together, she originated theories about the death instinct and wrote about 30 articles, she trained the early generation of psychoanalysts in Russia-her life was cut short in 1941 when she was killed by the Nazis.<br /><br />Would it have been better to remain in Vienna amidst the creative ferment? Would she have kept productive and did she need the madness/edginess/competition to create? Is love hotter when it is forbidden and secret? As Spielrein wrote in her own diary (February 22, 1912):<br /><br /> No ashes, no coal can burn with such glow as a secretive love of which no one must know.<br /><br />Kay Jamison, herself a sufferer of bipolar disorder, tackled this question in Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament. In her earlier writings, she came down on the side of sobriety; creativity is not helped by manic-depressive disorders and medication is in order. In her later writings, she did acknowledge the contribution of manic-depressive illness to creativity. Anne Sexton also tried to have a normal 1950s suburban married life to keep herself grounded, became bored and left--but committed suicide anyway. So did Sylvia Plath.<br /><br />What is a talented woman to do?<br /><br />One could say that in Victorian times, women suffered from repression, and showed classical symptoms of hysteria. However, the treatment of choice for them might have been an independent income and a job; Freud's Anna O., who walked out of his office, went on to become a well-known social worker. Ellen West, who was expertly diagnosed and phenomenologically described by Binswanger, died anyway; but Kim Chernin, a feminist psychologist, re-analyzed the case by prescribing a job and independence for Ellen West.<br /><br />These are some of the questions raised for me once again by seeing the film. I don't think there are easy answers, and certainly we are no longer in Victorian times; the issues were particular to those times, but also universal and applicable to women today.<br /><br />Some quick comments about the film itself: I thought it was just OK. First, Jung was a big, hearty charismatic man; in the film, he was rather sensitive and effete. Second, Freud was powerful and deep; in the film, I thought he was just dark and somewhat creepy. Third, Sabina Spielrein was a strong woman; in the film, Kira Knightley over-acted her symptoms and desperation. Emma Jung was large and strong, not the delicate beauty in the film. None of the characters in the film, although they made appropriate gestures and conversation, touched me. Finally, the explicit sexual scenes left me puzzled. I thought that it was never confirmed whether their relationship was \\"consummated\\" and wondered how such liberties could be taken.<br /><br />In short, this film is psychologically rich, intriguing, and leaves the viewer with more questions than answers.<br /><br />Bio: Ilene Serlin is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association and the Society for the Study of Women (Div. 35).

B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed \\"Catching Fire,\\" the second book in Suzanne Collins Hunger Games series. There were several things I liked about the book. First and foremost, I love the concept that Suzanne Collins has come up with. The story is very imaginative, and it continues with \\"Catching Fire.\\" Second, I found the increasing dichotomy between the districts and the Capitol fascinating, and how the desire of the human spirit to be free continues despite how much adversity we face.<br /><br />Even though I did enjoy this book, I only gave this book 4 out of 5 stars. The reason for that is because I found myself drifting during Katniss's long mental monologues. But overall, this was a very good story. I am looking forward to reading the 3rd book in the series.<br /><br />Shaun F. Messick<br />Author<br />[[ASIN:B004Y5KQHO Worlds Without End: The Mission (Book 1)]]

B004HEXSLI|5.0|Many nueroanatomists try to make sense of the human brain and how it functions with mental behavior. Not many people have the opportunity to experience the realities of their brain and academic knowledge outside of the laboratory, unless they undergo a complex medical condition. It's always a different experience when someone with expertise is placed in that position- or when their body forces them in that situation.<br />Jill Bolte Taylor, Ph.D. was actually put in that situation and was able to do more than just suffer from the experience. She had the ability to learn from the stroke and to communicate her learning to an interested audience. The book, My Stroke of Insight, is an extraordinary memoir written by Dr. Taylor. Dr. Taylor is a neuroanatomist who developed her knowledge as a brain scientist through a Ph.D. at Indiana University and post-graduate fellowship at Harvard University. She was elected to serve on the Board of Directors for NAMI, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, advocating the \\"tissue issue,\\" asking people to donate their brains to science. Interestingly enough, she was able to apply all her knowledge when she experienced a stroke in her left hemisphere at the age of 37. Eight years later Dr. Taylor completely recovered from this severe brain hemorrhage and wrote a memoir to share her experience.<br />One of the main points that Dr. Taylor wants her readers to understand is that both brain hemispheres are able to adapt to change and recover from injuries. She learned that, as one hemisphere fails, the other hemisphere still has the capability to allow a person to function. Her remaining right hemisphere was filled with gratitude for life, focusing on current moments and allowing her to break the boundaries of stereotypes, race, and religion. Conversely, Dr. Taylor's damaged, but previously dominant, left hemisphere remained preoccupied with forms of communication, details, and routine. Dr. Taylor found a new gift of identifying patterns, memorizing, and even allowing herself to consciously improve her left mind's ego center as well.<br />She also stresses being able to identify the signs of a stroke to get help sooner and therefore possibly minimize stroke damage. Dr. Taylor explains how the acronym \\"STROKE\\" summarizes the signs of a stroke: S=Speech that is impaired, T=Tingling or Numbness, R= Remembering difficulties, O= Off balance with coordination, K= Killer Headache, E= Eye problems.<br />Dr. Taylor covers multiple topics, but divides the book into 20 different chapters, such as \\"Jill's Pre-Stroke Life,\\" \\"Simple Science,\\" and \\"Day Two: The Morning After.\\" The basic brain terminology for the reader's understanding is essential, but an expert runs the risk that the average reader may roll his or her eyes and put the book down. Dr. Taylor decided to present science in chapters two and three, but keeps it simple through small pictures that help readers understand the anatomy of her cognitive, physical, and spiritual experiences. She presents images and explains the functions of the gyrus and the sulcus, defines neurotransmitters, traces our brain back to our ancestors, and observes brain plasticity. She then gives a personal account of the morning of the stroke, what it was like to be without a language or the capability to understand numbers, and how she began a new life again with the help of her mom, G.G.<br />The book is an inspirational memoir reminding the reader that growth and healing are possible even under the worst circumstances. Dr. Taylor describes her recovery as stages of normal human development by learning how to walk, talk, and read again. What makes this memoir inspiring is the effort she dedicates to her brain. She emphasizes trying difficult and unfamiliar tasks because if she never made this effort, her recovery might not have happened. What makes it even more inspiring is the fact that during the whole process, she kept repeating to herself that it could be worse. If she could not remember something, she and G.G. made a point to make a new memory. Imaging the patience it must have took to be taught infant steps in an adult body and still having enough hope is inspiring. I am filled with respect for this woman!<br />Dr. Taylor must have done something right to recover from this stroke. According to Dr. Taylor, in her chapter \\"What I Needed the Most,\\" her recovery was successful because people treated her as though she was actually going to recover by supporting and encouraging her. Her recovery process was effective in part because G.G. allowed her to get plenty of sleep, unlike most rehabilitation centers that make the patient work around the center's rigid schedule. G.G.'s presence also allowed for a personalized schedule of cognitive exercises. When Dr. Taylor felt well rested after about six hours, she was willing to put in about 20 minutes for more strenuous tasks to avoid headaches and to focus her attention. Interestingly, she honored her brain when it reached a maximum level of input, and then focused on more rest. She took this sleep seriously: lights out, TV off, and earplugs in to ensure sleep.<br />Most importantly, the main connection Dr. Taylor makes is the plasticity she experiences in her brain. Plasticity explains why her writing is simple and how she becomes adventurous, empathetic, and full of new emotions. With a left hemisphere that remained damaged nonetheless, the complex functionality of her brain allowed her to read, speak, and learn again. Dr. Taylor had to explore the world's textures, features, and characteristics as if it was for the first time. With assistance from G.G. she learned what it was like to walk on sidewalks, that the lines in the cement had no meaning, and what it was like to slide her foot on ice. She even adjusted to the radiant light in a grocery store by wearing sunglasses.<br />Overall, I believe this book can be a great read for a wide range of audiences. The small anatomical images that help illustrate simple science in chapters two and three are perfect for most students. It is also beneficial to adults who are not as familiar with the brain and what a stroke is. For those who are out of their zone of expertise or perhaps are interested in gaining knowledge about what a stroke is, this book offers assessment questions focusing on symptoms that may be present before a stroke. Dr. Taylor explains some of the symptoms and what to look for in this kind of situation. The book also offers detailed explanations of the differences between a blood clot, aneurysm, and normal blood flow stated in simple terms. Lastly, in my opinion, this book would be most beneficial to stroke survivors and their caregivers. It reveals an unknown path of evidence to what most stroke patients cannot tell us. Dr. Taylor's list of forty simple things she needed most after her stroke is great evidence to what most caregivers or readers are looking for.<br />In conclusion, if you're interested in a simple read, I would recommend My Stroke of Insight. If the catchy chapter titles previously stated don't already intrigue you, she makes it easy to understand important topics by bolding sentences. She writes with a tone of gratitude for life and, most importantly, uses simple language, which gives the reader a sense of appreciation for her. As a prestigious neuroanatomist, she makes the effort to make the book comprehensible, instead of trying to present herself as a significant and formal scientist. She stresses that her brain disorder did not destroy her life and through others she was able to put her life back together. All she asks of you is to exchange this information with loved ones.uld not remember something, she and G.G. made a point to make a new memory. Imaging the patience it must have took to be taught infant steps in an adult body and still having enough hope is inspiring.

B00028HBKC|5.0|Just rewatching this after several years. They really did a good job. I have no complaints. I'm grateful it was made. Like the Lord of the Rings, I didn't think it could be done well.<br />I forgot that they used Aramaic. They could have used King James English. I hear that's more accurate. :-)
B000FC1HBY|5.0|OMG thank you son for letting me know about these books, and bonus the first book Game of Thrones is now on HBO. I love love love them, can't find enough hours in a day so all's I can do is read.
1451673442|5.0|I love .. I'm a big fan of Rhonda Byrne and very interested in all her writing and way if thinking .. It can be explained like applying to the secret which I think makes it the perfect one of the three books of her !! Amazing !! THANK YOU !!
B0056C6XIA|4.0|First, I have to say that all the tools on this item do what they are made for very well. The scissors, knives, sawblade, etc. work exceptionally well, and don't disappoint me. And the best part: the flashlight is extremely bright. I haven't needed to use the fire striker yet, though. The only thing that bugs me is the quality. The first time you hold it in your hand, it feels like it's going to fall apart. Opening the pliers isn't smooth. Instead, opening it kind of feels like the hinges are oiled with molasses. The blades, although excellent at doing what they do, are made with a very plastic-felling lightweight metal. If you get this multi-tool, you should put some WD-40, or some kind of lubricant on the metal pieces, I think it will help. Finally, opening and closing the various tools requires specialized training of some sort. The locking mechanism it very hard to use (at least on mine), and I have to use two hand to unlock the blade. It doesn't feel like it is locked solidly at all, as the tools are all loose. It is not reliable at all. I give this 4 stars (instead of 2 or 3) because, although the quality sucks, it actually works rather well, and has not dulled after a few months of, albeit light, use.<br /><br />Suggestion: My first multi-tool was the Leatherman Sidekick (although not the best Leatherman, it is reliable, lighter, and not as bulky as this), which costs about $30-40. I even got it with a blade sharpener, and fire striker for a total cost of $50 exactly. Throw in a $2 flashlight and it would be much better than this one item.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|we really like playing this game.  A bit like Mario but better price.  Good for kids and adults.  Please keep these game coming.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game. has lots of variety so with one app you are really getting 124! Most of the games are really fun butyou only start out with 10 and work your way up based on the points you get when you play.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|so far so good. still trying out more games and earning points to buy additional games. of the games I have played so far only 1 or 2 have been mind numbingly boring.
0736092269|5.0|Very detail oriented book. It has plenty of pictures and differnt kinds of work outs to do. It has work outs for every part of the body. Also includes possible injuries that can happen when the work out is done incorrectly.

B005HEPM5W|5.0|Data creates a child and their relationship is threatened at once by Starfleet. Picard is at his best here and so is Data. Riker adds a very funny scene, too. One of the best for Data fans. Keep the Kleenex box handy.

044042321X|5.0|There is something different about holding an actual book in you hands. I bought this after reading the first chapter on my iPad. The book is a great size for viewing the amazing illustrations and packed full of content. If you like the show, you will love this interpretation.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Have had hours of fun.  Great game.  Fun for all ages.  Would recommend it for anyone whomlikes to play games.

B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This item was surprised me since i bought it.<br />Since i unboxed it, i find a very interesting surprises inside the beautiful box i gave to my wife as a birthday gift.<br />The Blu-ray movie look just so impressive, the colors are bright, the sharpness is just amazing, is like view an entire new picture, no more bad quality.

B00634GHJA|1.0|the 5 star alliance wants to keep FAOTD alive. Well, the TOSA disagrees. If we give an app a low star rating and list it's problems, the developer can improve it, and thus we help make apps better. Trolls are hilarious, and give the downloaders a good laugh. The developer knows that the trolls are just, well.....trolls.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I played this and couldn't put it down. Great for times when you just need to relax and not stress your mind.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|being adhd I like having a game that I can play for a little while and put it down this is a good game for that
030746363X|5.0|I was really excited about the 4 hour body, because I was pretty sick of using other products that required major changes and long term commitment in order to work. I would start a program, then get sick of it quick because it was tough to follow. Tim Ferris does a great job explaining what you need to do to lose weight, run faster, lift more weight, etc. It's an easy read and actually pretty entertaining. One thing I really liked about how he structured each section was that there was a \\"geeks' corner\\" where he describes the hard data that he recorded in each chapter of the book. Everything that he describes is easy to do, because all you have to do is follow it. There's no room for error, because it's so simple. For me, I've lost a total of 10 pounds on the \\"Slow Carb Diet\\" that he gives in the book, and it's only been a month! And the best part is, I did exercise more than I usually do (which is barely at all), and I was able to eat as much as I wanted, so no major hunger pains! If you want quick, easy, visible results, check out this book.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|hey well if you are wondering if u should buy the complete series of dr quinn its a yes yes yes yesssssssss this product is so good, very good quality and cheap too, considering u get the whole series and two movies it is sooooooo good. a big thumbs up from me!!!! amazon always delivers :)
006072448X|5.0|This is a beautifully written fiction because it mirrors true life.  I have a Kevin in my life.  And I am terrified.  And there is no help.  The  only reality this book did not convey for those of us who have a Kevin is the the daily terror and fright we live with.  Otherwise, this story was engrossing and a page-turner, I saw my family on each page. Very,very good read.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|The Strengths Finder book (and online evaluation) was very helpful. I am looking for a new career. The online evaluation was user friendly and I was surprised with the amount of helpful information I received. It really helped me clarify my passions and natural gifting. I would recommend it to anyone who is wondering what they want to do next in life! The Kindle version is cool because I got it instantly!

1612930727|5.0|The Power of your subconscious mind is a good book for somebody who wants to learn about her/his subconscious mind.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm two an a half books into this trilogy.  And I have to say the romance is amazing and the story is great.  The characters are strong and I've enjoyed reading each book.<br /><br />The back ground of the characters is amazing and complex.  I feel their pain and the emotions that they are going through while trying to change their pasts to make the romance work.<br /><br />I don't think the bedroom sex is over the top and have found a fondness for silver silk tie's now... I don't think there is a couple that doesn't enjoy putting a little kink in a relationship to add a little mystery and fun.  Too much some are saying really, I don't think so.  My parents were married for 45 years and I remember Dad smacking Mom and the butt, and that little smile she always gave.<br /><br />If you want to read a great romance with a little hot sex....this is a great series of books.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have got to have a weather app and this is the one to have.  I definitly love this app.
B005WZZRD8|4.0|As a Lady Gaga collector I found myself buying this unquestioningly. But others might want to consider their options. For one, you are buying a package of existing merch; there is no \\"unique\\" CD or DVD that is unavailable in other products.<br /><br />Do you or your giftee already own one or more of the items in the collection? If you don't care for duplicates, you may want to go ahead and complete the set individually. This set is a good deal for someone who wants all pieces for a decent price. There is even a little new photography that makes it exciting. Other than that the packaging is pretty standard.
B007V693YK|1.0|I've always enjoyed the website, but the app is garbage. locks up my phone, and won't work at all on the Kindle Fire.  don't bother with it
145551389X|5.0|I am a big Lady Gaga fan so buying this book was not a question to me. Half-hearted or casual fans might not care so much. But here's my two cents.<br /><br />The book itself is a huge hardback, almost textbook size. There are at least a couple hundred pages of full-page color and black/white photographs. All of it is unique photography and not reiterated promographs.<br /><br />It contains various stages of drunk and nakedness, meaning it might not be the best coffee table book for when your in laws visit. Some photos are split onto two pages when they really should not be (because the cut off point is really odd and not intuitive). Some pages are left blank randomly, but not a large number of them. None of the photos have captions, so unless you know your Gaga you will not know when anything was taken, who is in the photos (besides Gaga which is obvious), or any fashion credits.<br /><br />So it is not the perfect photo book, but for a gaga fan I'd consider it a must-have.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love this trilogy - I'm part way through the third book and am amazed that it gets better and better.  My daughter and grandson (12) read them together and told me about them - I downloaded it right away and have been sorry I didn't have a whole day or two to just sit and read. I hope to get more time tomorrow to try to finish them.
B0055SWM08|5.0|its actually really great! if you enjoy a puzzle game then this is a good one to keep in your Pocket.

0399159029|4.0|Having followed the Bernie Gunther series from it's inception, I was ambivalent about this, the most recent installment.  The first 3 books (grouped and sold in a single volume) were simply superior: cunningly crafted, elegantly written, peppered with wry wit, freely bestowed with authorial liberties which admixed historical and fictitious personages and endowed with byzantine (but credible) plots.  After that, the books became cliche and, by the time of \\"Field Gray\\", it seemed the series should be retired.  So, I awaited \\"Prague Fatale\\" with some trepidation.  As it happens, Kerr has pulled Bernie back from the precipice.  Although a bit shopworn, the book has revivified Bernie.<br /><br />In brief, abandoning the chronology of the initial books (Bernie from pre-war inception to post-war malaise) Kerr re-installs the dour, slightly dilapidated, world-weary and terminally cynical detective in early wartime Germany and then into the \\"Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia\\", the former Czechoslovakia.  Early on in Berlin, Bernie chances upon something that seems what it is not and, by the usual improbable chain of interconnected circumstances, ends up in Prague working for SS Prince of the Realm Heydrich.  Following the (acknowledged) lead of Agatha Christie (the justly famed \\"closed-room\\" murder in \\"Roger Ackroyd\\"), an SS aide de camp is murdered.  A cross section of SS luminaries, one of whom is suspected in the case and also suspected as a spy for the Czech resistance are in residence at the secluded country manor (a psychotic's \\"Downton Abby\\")...who done it?<br /><br />As before, all the SS higher-ups are improbably urbane, eloquent, vaguely resentful of their colleagues, cynically pragmatic, ideologically removed from Nazi claptrap and engaged in barely concealed double-dealings and sordid affairs of one sort or another.  The sophisticated and slightly detached commentary even extends to SS lowlives such as the expert torturer, Sgt. Soppa.  Leaving aside the invented dialogue which is more akin to early post-war Hollywood caricatures of Nazi officers (cultural affectations, sartorial excellence, keen and probing intelligence), Kerr has done immense research into the period and it shows.<br /><br />While having a certain degree of intelligence; a great deal of cunning; an pragmatic inclination; and a lust for power, it seems incredible that Heydrich would indulge Bernie's provocations and challenging insults to the extent suggested herein.  Based on recent comprehensive histories of Himmler (e.g. Longerich's book) and Heydrich (\\"Hitler's Hangman\\"), it seems fantastic that Bernie's head would have rested so smugly, insolently and satisfyingly situated on his neck in real life.  Its also encouraging that Bernie's moral equivocation regarding the fate of the Jews and other unfortunates at the hands of his Nazi colleagues has finally and firmly been secured on the side of the oppressed.  Kerr compensates to some extent by extending a sense of moral ambiguity on the \\"actions\\" in the \\"East\\" to many Nazi satraps:  unfortunately, there is little or nothing in the actual historical literature to support that move.  Finally, and to give away only a minor element of the plot, the postulated reason for Heydrich's (fortunate) turn for the worse and eventual demise is pure baloney: Himmler and Heydrich (according to the authoritative Longerich biography) were ideological intimates and close allies.<br /><br />So, \\"Praque Fatale\\" is certainly entertaining.  Its not quite to the standard of the first 3 books, especially when the absence of witty repart&eacute; and Chandler-like metaphors are factored into consideration.  But its a vast improvement on the 3 immediate predecessors.  Its not a good introduction to the series but its not a bad one, either.  In short, its an encouraging development for Bernie Gunther fans and good enough to encourage the purchase of the next case.d dialogue which is more akin to early post-war Hollywood caricatures of Nazi officers (cultural affectations, sartorial excellence, keen and probing intelligence), Kerr has done immense research into the period and it shows.<br /><br />While having a certain degree of intelligence; a great deal of cunning; an pragmatic inclination; and a lust for power, it seems incredible that Heydrich would indulge Bernie's provocations and challenging insults to the extent suggested herein.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|While you get more extended features, cover art and such with buying the films individually, this set gives you all the movies in one, easy to access collection. A must have for those that want to see all of the Harry Potter movies, whenever...
B0055SWM08|4.0|this is a great thinking game, not too hard not too easy.  it's great when you need a break to think about something else.  make sure you try to get a perfect score on the levels... enjoy
B0001907DA|5.0|The collection came in a nice box. I ordered it for my parents for Christmas.  Delivery was good and it was in great shape.  I could not believe I found the entire set in one box.  The price was great also. It made a great gift.
B000035Z3K|5.0|It's hard to figure out how to watch the movie and hear the music at the same time.  To do this on my PC, I had to do this:<br /><br />1. Load and start the movie<br />2. In the Windows Media Player, towards the bottom, select \\"DVD.\\"<br />3. From the next menu, select \\"Root Menu.\\"<br />4. At the next screen, select \\"Bonus Materials.\\"<br />5. On the next screen, select \\"New score by Philip Glass ...\\"<br />6. On the next screen, select \\"Play Movie.\\"<br /><br />It took a lot of fooling around until I found this - pretty bad.  But, the music is very interesting!  I don't know how this would be done on a Mac.
0545425115|5.0|Read this book b/c all of the hype it's been getting. Really worthwhile and easy read. Brought it with me on vacation and finished it fairly quickly.
B000E6ET1G|5.0|Apparently this CD came out before the Box Set, so I'm re-writting my review. With that being true, this is a 5* CD. The sound quality is great and one can't argue with the selections. Track 19 is the only Stereo cut here but that's O.K because Mono was still king on AM radio back then. Also check out The Amboy Dukes (Ted Nugent) on Track 19. There are some familiar tracks here with some I have never heard before. If you can, do get the Box Set which continues the story of this CD. Highly recommended! Thanks for the info Harvey.
B007WPM4V4|5.0|I became addicted to Mad Men recently and have watched all the seasons in just under 3 days.  This last episode \\"Faraway Places\\" brings back the creativeness of the story and writing on this show.  Everytime I think it is getting dull and predictable, an episode like this one jumps up.  I really look forward to Mondays again.
B0016JBCJW|1.0|Don't waste your time on this.  I was mad at myself for watching the whole thing hoping it would get better.  Never did!
B005V20JKI|5.0|This is the most addictive game I have ever played. it deserves nothing less than a perfect five star rating for the awesome graphics and amazing game play.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I know that there has been alot of bad reviews and stuff but this the best app evr! This app my continue  running but it is still great.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|I just got this today and I immediately hooked up my Canon Vixia M41 to try it out. It's pretty sturdy, and light. I'm guessing if you bust while using it skateboarding it might break but for nice tracking shots it appears to work out great. There are haters on here that rash it, but for the price I think it's a neat option to have to add movement to your shots. I am glad I purchased it.

B00526ZKYS|4.0|This is a dystopian but it doesn't seem TOO far into the future.  I agree with other reviewers, if you are expecting Hunger Games don't read this.  If you want to read a love story about a place in the future where love is considered a disease that kill you, READ THIS.  :D<br /><br />The writing seemed somewhat current, they have cell phones and text, go to college, eat fish sticks, typical stuff.  So I think it was written as near future.  There writing flowed well and was written in a beautiful style.  I'd compare the writing style to that of Lauren Kate.<br /><br />The story is of Lena who is going to be cured from love on her 18th birthday and then paired with a mate.  She has a best friend who was a great add in character named Hana and of course, finds a love interest in the handsome Alex.  Whenever I hear the word Autumn I will think of him.<br /><br />The ending was bittersweet and sad but in the kindle version you get a long free sample of the next book which starts off amazing so I'm really excited to start on it.  I'd rate this between 3.5-4 Stars.  Well executed, the action was good, I cringed, I laughed, I swooned, and I cried.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great. Loved the American version, and this is even better! Recommend it to anyone who has seen the original. It feels like an even more connected storyline than what I saw on PBS.
B004HEXSLI|5.0|I have had surgeries for aneurysms and a stroke and I know how frightening it can be to not be the \\"same\\" person that you or a loved one once were.  This book looks at the cause for stokes, the importance of immediate care,and the work--yes, work-- that one must do to recover.  It explains how the brain works and what happens to it when a stoke or an aneurysm occurs, and then tells you what must be done to recover, how long, and how much recovery that one can expect.  I have recommended this book to my aneurysm group and to anyone that I come in contact with in my volunteer work at the hospital, and I certainly recommend it to you.
B0055S348W|2.0|Seems solid enough, but I can't print because there is no driver for my Epson workforce 520. Tried some other workfoce drivers... but no good. Tech support responds quickly, but offers no heplful suggestions at all.  It would be nice if they established a cross reference of compatible drivers.  So they could say, no driver for 520.... use this......  Instead they just say....Its not our fault...these other guys havent released it...... duh. Wasted 7 bucks....they no longer had the free version on Amazon to test my printer b4 puchase .... so I got stuck.  Beware.
0307477479|1.0|One of the worse books I have ever read - really, a Pulitzer?  At least the power point chapter helped me to get through the book quick.  Terrible!
B0029ZA3H4|2.0|If you've been around the web for any length of time, you probably don't need to purchase this book. As other reviewers have noted, I wanted to like this book too, but just couldn't derive any practical knowledge that I didn't already have. Gary's enthusiasm and drive certainly come through via his written word - and for that, he is worth reading. However, any veteran of the web - like myself - won't find much here that is new. On the other hand, if you don't know what Wordpress is, haven't created a Twitter account yet, or have been avoiding LinkedIn - then buy this book as you may well learn something. Frankly, similar information is available on countless blogs for free. I like Gary, by the way - this review (unlike some other reviews) is concerned only with \\"Crush It\\", and not the author.<br /><br />All readers - currently engaged on the web or not - should get something from reading Gary's view of the digital world (and the business world in general) in the immediate future. Gary is a top notch marketer, and obviously knows how to work social media for all it's worth. While the book didn't provide me with much new information - buy it if you are new to social media or have been slaving in a corporate world for too long and need the perspective of a small business marketer (who has obviously achieved a degree of success).

I figured the sound quality of a 1970s concert would not be great, and sometimes I prefer studio versions of songs. Well, I bought it today and I'm glad I did. She breathes new life into old hits here, and the sound quality is good. Some of the songs have a subtle jazzy quality, while others have more of a folk feel. I'd recommend this to any Joni Mitchell fan.

B005SFR7YE|4.0|I enjoyed this version very much and it's probably my favorite filmed version of the show so far. The only part I wasn't so sure about was Ramin Karimloo as the Phantom; too much yelling and perhaps not enough modulations in his tones at certain points; perhaps a little OTT at other points. I wanted a little more subtlety and seduction and perhaps a more menacing laugh. The performance perhaps lacked a little maturity. But still quite good. Maybe that's just a symptom of a boisterous, high-energy theatrical production rather than one produced in a recording studio.
1603429999|5.0|I own most of Margaret's books and ALL are really wonderful. I admit I'm not too crazy about the cover of this one...it certainly doesn't draw you in. I passed it over many times until I realized she was the author then I knew it had to be a great book~~ You won't be disappointed in your purchase.

B003ZSJ212|4.0|Okay so first off I don't like the look of blu-ray so I'm not going to say anything about the picture quality. I refuse to get an HDMI cable and I honestly bought blu-ray just so I could see what so many people were complaining about. So the general consensus is that george lucas ruined star wars with prequels and altered scenes. I disagree. While the prequels arent as good, they still are entertaining and provide a nice back story. And while many of the blu ray changes to the original are unnecessary,they don't ruin the film and leave me in an outrage. So some important changes:<br />The new digital yoda looks....good. Not great or amazing. Its better then the puppet but my main problem is that the voice frank oz does is different in 1 then it is in two or three. So when the character has the same look but a different style of speaking its a little distracting for me.<br /><br />The new obi-wan scream.....is unbelievable. It really is awful and quite possibly the worst change.I cant describe it.<br /><br />R2D2 hides behind rocks...they look pretty real. and when I look back on the original he does seem very out in the open and not hidden.<br /><br />Greedo shooting first....is a lot cleaner and smoother then the shoulder jump in the 2nd and 3rd revision.<br /><br />Lukes lightsaber training.... looks the same to me. Maybe I need my hdmi to see the actual blue saber but I saw no difference and I was a little dissapointed.<br /><br />jaba's giant door.... seem unnecessary. But it makes the scene when c-3po knocks on it a lot funnier honestly.<br /><br />The blinking ewok eyes.... are soooooooo dumb. It wouldn't bother me too much if they looked better. But they are finely detailed and if the ewok moves his head too much the eyes seem to bob. Scenes with multiple ewoks are almost hypnotizing. I hate the ewoks anyway so it does justify my hate a little more when I watch it.<br /><br />Darth vader's no.... isn't that bad. When I heard about it I was devastated but whenI watched it i was fine. It has kind of a cool effect and it does kinda make sense that he would vocalized killing the mofo who ruined his life. Wouldnt you?<br /><br />All in all this is a very good box set. The Bonus material is solid and satisfying. The packaging alone is worth the money. It's not as bad as some make it out to be, I have every version and I accept them all. Honestly the originals look so bad they are easier to laugh at then the new releases. If your a hater, then dont watch them and blog about it. If you love star wars and are curious to see whats changed now, get this set

B0071XO8RA|3.0|Howey is a talented writer and his opening story about the silo gripped my imagination. I enjoy his craft and truly interesting world. As an author, I appreciate his willingness to explore new book publishing models and his connection with his readers. To succeed as a writer today, a great deal if not all the marketing falls upon your shoulders.<br /><br />My quibble concerns Howey's comments at the end of the omnibus. If I understand correctly he will continue to explore the silo world in future stories. This feels like the TV series LOST. I know it had many admirers and fans, but it also lost many due to the inability for the story arc to move towards a comprehensible conclusion. Like it or not, human brains generally like even epics to end. My two cents and perspective - I hope to read no-silo stories from this skilled and imaginative writer.
