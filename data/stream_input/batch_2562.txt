B004QL7K6Q|4.0|it has moments of crazy comedy.  Most of it is kind of stupid but when it is all over, I looked back saying not bad and I'd watch it on and off again with friends and such....and Jennifer Aniston, amazing!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game. I enjoy playing with this horse when I can't be at the barn. my daughter uses this to keep her from going through riding withdrawals when we aren't with the horses loo.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|The acting in this movie was great.  I got lost a couple times because I'm not strong in my American Political history but I did enjoy the film.  I'll probably watch it again to gain further appreciation.
B004UID2LC|5.0|great to find little video's for the grandkids to watch. they really enjoy this and it is easy to use.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I love this series, I love Sylvia Day, I didn't love this book. I was so happy to have been able to finally read book 3 to this series. It started well, but mid book it started to drag for me. I also felt that the sexual scenes between. Gideon and Eva were book fillers. (I know, I can't believe I said that either, but it was over the top with nothing more for me, no story really) I'm glad that there are more books to follow, because I love G and E, I just hope they are better than this. The book was all over the place for me and the last part of the book felt rushed and then bam finished. It left me scratching my head.<br /><br />I think that it was so highly anticipated for so long that I expected it to have been good and not just OK. I would recommend you read it if your going to continue with this series. I will be. This book does have some good parts to it that I did like.<br /><br /> I still have faith in Sylvia Day and hope for a better book 4 and 5.
0345529057|5.0|second time we get this books give away the 1 set now hope to keep this one around for a while
0440237688|5.0|I have loved the Giver since I first read it in the fourth grade. I have since read it more than 20 times.
B005HSL626|3.0|This is a fun game to plan.  Wish it came with instructions so that I would better understand how it works.
B0000696I0|5.0|This is another great masterpiece of a movie, I love it, I can watch it over and over :) I recommend :)
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I recommend this game to any shooter fans. Even mc3 &amp; mc4 fans I haven't played nova yet but I'm sure those fans would like this game...have fun!!!
B0063M22QO|4.0|This is a fun and challenging game.  Wish it had a few more options or came with instructions.  It's fun!
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Simply put you have three kinds of supernatural here. While it may be confusing, the authors does a fantastic job separating and describing each and places contextual reference that keeps the reader mentally rooted while thoroughly intrigued. The same goes for characters, places, events and major plot themes. It's because of this that you appreciate the occasional interlacing plot twist and turn without bowing to confusion.  Though fastpaced and intriguing certain aspects of the main characters love story are repetitive and drawn out. While this is the authors prerogative I found it to be distracting rather than helpfully descriptive.  Still absolutely no regrets about the experience and pleasantly awaiting the final installment.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another special guy who's character is strong and determined.  Good and interesting traits, and makes you think and relate to the World's problems.
B001N3OJEG|5.0|When I first watched this film 15 years ago when it came out, I was confused:  so many names to remember and associations to make.  But after viewing it again, it made more sense and it has since become one of my favorite films.  Danny DeVito should have been nominated for an award ... he dooes an excellent job in a supporting role.  The lead actors are wonderful.  This should have won an Academy awatd, but was outstripped by the tear-jerking Titantic.  What I particulartly enjoy, in addition to the excellent is the cinematography and the wonderful and realistic way the director depicts 1950s Los Angeles.  A great flick!
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|A little bit predictable towards the end, but still, an excellent book. Nicholas Sparks is definitely one of my favorite authors.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|I don't play the piano but when I got this I loved it<br />I play till the battery gets low lol
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I'm definitely glad I got this as the free app of the day, but I'd gladly pay for this! Puts a creative spin on a classic puzzle game
B00A81NFAS|5.0|Great fun.  I watched it many times.  Amazingly good acting from all star cast.  Quirky and very pleasant plot.  A really good time.
B00AK57N00|5.0|It is a good time killer. It is great for kids. What more can you ask for. It is a great game for the road and just sitting around in all its is a great game for kids
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Maybe it is just me but I read about half of this book and didn't care about the characters at all.  The development is too slow and the parts between the porn sections is boring.
B005PK57IK|4.0|It is a great series.Good writing, good cast. Who could ask for more. I have watched this series for a long time wouldn't want to miss it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This games so addictive and awesome! It has buckets, spawn eggs, and a ton more awesome stuff! Show yo love for mojang and please buy this game!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Good graphics, puzzles, and hidden objects. Takes bit of patience rand thought, unless you want to use the hints  frequently.
B004RZGUBM|4.0|For less than £2 I get all the works plus the essays plus some critical reviews. What's not to like? I almost feel guilty.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Love the game, very addictive. My daughter suggested it to me and I can't put it down. One big complaint though. NO WAY TO GET AN MORE GEMS WITH OUT REAL CASH. If there was an option to be able to get gems free I would change rating to 5 stars. Cuz it definitely is an awesome game.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Great but why kill Matthew!  He was my favorite characters.  I have a hard time picturing the show without him.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Fallen Tree Games clearly put a monumental effort into producing this work of art. The first two Quells in this trilogy were amazing, Memento takes it to a whole new level. There is no other puzzle game in Memento's class. The story is compelling and more fleshed out than the prior iterations. The artwork is phenomenal and the music is compelling and fits the theme like a glove. If you enjoy puzzles, you will find no finer example than Quell Memento. Bravo!
B007W8S2MG|5.0|an awesome game with and awesome story that has hours of entertainment you won't regret buying this item. Have Fun!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|First of all I love this app because I download a lot of games and this saves me so much downloading but, the title is a lie because they have way  more than 101+31 games and for almost every reason they give you points!
0060599847|5.0|...and I will continue to listen over and over as it is amazing and so easy to follow.  Enough said!
B00005N6KG|5.0|My husband and I love these headphones. We use them until they don't work and then get on amazon to buy more! They have lasted for about 4-5 years each pair.
140131046X|5.0|This true story while sad in places is so inspiring.  It demonstrates the simplicity of God's joy in our hearts.  It's beautiful.
B009GZKO2O|3.0|I also bought the 1982 DVD starring Teresa Stratus, Carreras, and Scotto just so I could compare the two, especially seeing they are very different. Now I'm a big fan of Anna Netrebko so I figured it couldn't be as bad as some reviews were saying.  Well, maybe this version wasn't as bad, but for me, it definitely was not as good or as moving as the 1982 performance. If you are looking to spend your money on just one La Boheme, I think you are better off purchasing the other one. But then again, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, isn't it?
B007ZTLLMK|3.0|It was an ok game but it lagged a lot on my hydro. I don't think my phone was fast enough for this game.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|A great way to get a POSITIVE outlook on yourself or any of your friends, spouse, kids, etc... we need to remember that people respond favorably to positive critiques rather than negative ones.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|It's fun, just not a game I'm into a whole lot. My kids like it better than I do. It wasn't my first choice.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Very disappointing, I was looking forward to a happy ending now another wait. \\"ain't nobody got time for that.\\" Sorry Ms. Day you've just lost me as a fan.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I love these books and am very sad this is the last one. So far many things have happened in the 100 pages or so I have read. I am taking my time with it seeing how its the last one. Plus True Blood starts in a week.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The two actors work very well together, the humor is awesome, good acting, interesting plot and story line that we haven't seen before - very enjoyable.
B005LAII0I|5.0|wonderful, fun version of snow white.  great music. sword fights was excellent. the seven dwarfs were not what I was expecting, but delightful. good self-image for a young woman.
B00C2C637I|5.0|This story is vintage bradbury. His green river world becomes upset by the autumn people who are trying to gain lives.<br />This story has many metaphors on a variety of levels. Mostly in speaking of age...aging...seasons of life. All combined with a classic. almost biblical story of good versus evil.<br />I saw the movie when it was released and have to say I think they did a good job.<br />I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys a well crafted story.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Very disappointed this book did not wrap up!! I don't write alot if reviews and I'm sure I can't change anyone's mind but it is just ridiculous that this was a trilogy (3) and book 3 is not the last one its the next to last one MAYBE!!  I needed the story to wrap up! It was a good trilogy if we had an ending but now my ending will just be hanging forever because I am not buying into this again!! May borrow someone's if anyone buys book 5 and read the very end but I'm over Sylvia Day and this series!! #horribledecisiontodragitout
1616550414|5.0|It is really nice to finally have an official Legend of Zelda timeline established instead of relying solely on fan-timelines. This book brings a lot of interesting info.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I thought the movie could have been edited more...take out at least a half an hour.  There were a few scenes that were a little too &#34;disney&#34; for me...pirate's of the Caribbean like action sequences...didn't appreciate that. But I did like how it was tied to the Lord of the Rings and I look forward to the next films.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Got me wondering in the beginning -0h -  but that did not last,  give it a wow raiting  wonderfull use of 3rd party
B005MMYCY6|2.0|It was predicable and cringe worthy at times. I didn't get much out of it. It's just not my thing.
034580404X|5.0|I haven't had time to read it yet but I have heard a lot of good reviews about it so far.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Not for me... it's defnitely exhausting to have watched it. all the shouting and the craziness just doesn't quite made it interesting enough and felt exhausted after watching it.
B00942G4UA|5.0|Amazing the choices regarding healthy food we have had removed from us, the antibiotics in the food chain, and the fact the government is ok with it.
B00459GJUM|5.0|Some of the best tv ever made. A departure from the comedic elements of the earlier shows in the franchise, this one takes itself seriously and really hits the nail on the head of high drama. Sad that they didn't get another season, but a brilliant season/series finale leaves the door open to the imagination.
B005SAP45I|4.0|This movie is not quite as good as the first movie.  I did like this movie, but it is not my favorite Pixar movie.
B00AMS38YU|4.0|Premium Rush is perhaps one of the most exciting bike-riding movies ever.  It's about a delivery boy (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who's job is to make prompt deliveries without anything standing in his way however... what if someone were to come out of nowhere and demand the delivery boy hand a package over to him?  This is the situation Joseph faces one afternoon.<br /><br />A guy (played by Michael Shannon) that we soon realize is a dirty cop associated with the Chinese mafia (or at least pretends to be associated) demands that Joseph hand over an important letter but... he refuses to, and since the delivery boy has a ton of experience on his bike given the fact he has to swerve around heavy Manhattan traffic all day, he's easily able to evade the cop.  Of course this is all entirely unrealistic since in reality a cop chasing a biker around presents a LOT of dangerous situations that wouldn't end well for either of them, but for the sake of an action/adventure film, it provides a good deal of entertainment watching the biker outsmart the cop time and time again as he knows all the secret shortcuts and hidden entrances between buildings that enable him to always stay one step ahead of the cop.<br /><br />One little detail the movie utilizes that I really admire is whenever Joseph is presented with a tricky situation so he contemplates the possible worst case scenarios involving a bike accident in his head before making the appropriate action.  Nice details there.  We actually *see* the possibilities of the worst case scenarios, since the movie writers went the extra mile and included them.  Other times Joseph finds himself racing against others (either friends of his, or friendly competitors- not really sure which) in the hopes of making a delivery before they do.  Friendly -but serious- competition basically.<br /><br />My only complaint is when all this bike riding excitement takes a back seat so a storyline involving a China town in Manhattan can develop, and specifically a Chinese woman who's desperately trying to legally get her young son out of China and into the United States.  Michael Shannon's police officer character constantly finds himself roughing up -or attempting to rough up- either Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character or the Asian people he deals with.  As a result, the bike racing excitement takes a back seat so this aspect of the storyline can develop which creates some slowdown and boredom from time to time (and the reason I'm taking away one star from the overall rating).<br /><br />Overall, despite the occasional boring moments, Premium Rush mostly delivers in bike riding, cop evasion entertainment.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|It certainly seems ridiculous at first, but you get to really like it by the end of the 1st season.
B001JU4S44|5.0|No film is perfect but Mission: Impossible 2 is a film that keeps viewers captivated, entwined, and glad they watched the film in the first place. While the premise of Mission Impossible is that exactly, an impossible mission, take some of the logic and \\"now that can't happen if\\" out of the viewing experience and you're left with an action/drama film that plays well. Is it the best film ever? Of course not, but if you're wanting to watch something for fun, this is the one.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|Hilarious movie that really deserved more attention at the box office. We hope there will be further adventures of these to lovable idiots...
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This app is awesome I have the original weaphones this is GREAT &amp; keep rating 5 stars they will get more weapons. Cool!!!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Hadn't seen it in 3D at the theater but the effect was great. Love the story and the humor thrown in. Great fun for the whole family.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Would have given 5 stars but the game was short,don't get me wrong it's a great game but I would have loved it more if it was longer
B006JSXYPA|4.0|Sure, it may be a little tired in the story department but the action was great and the 3D was BEAUTIFUL!
B0063M22QO|4.0|I don't play many games but this is really fun. I meant to only play for ten min or so........well...LOL.....it's been an hour now. Give it a try, it's worth it. See if you can put it down.  LOL  good luck!!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Great back story to the Alien Saga. Breath taking visuals and fantastic acting. Looking forward to seeing where this story leads.
B00992CF6W|5.0|same thing as the title this is one heck of a game to play.<br />my imagination will go on forever with this game.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Loved this movie and now I wish I had bought the 3D version. Breathtaking and great story telling. Critics were all wrong on this one.
0141040378|5.0|Beautiful book, vibrant colors!  I have slowly been collecting the series, they are really gorgeous, I hope to be able to collect them all!
0425263924|5.0|This series continues to get better and better.  From the onset of this series we fall in love with these characters and how deep they are and how they pull our own emotions, even for the characters we love to hate, we still want more!<br /><br />The only downfall with this book was having to wait so long to read it.  This is absolutely worth the read, and I'm happy to hear that this series continues on.  I can't wait to see where the characters take us, and how some of the story lines will be resolved.<br /><br />Sylvia once again does a fantastic job with her characters, the settings, and pulling us even more where we can't help but to want even more.  All the while pulling our heart strings as we watch the characters struggle and grow.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Love this game it is challenging and very interactive!  Just wish I could get gold faster! Other than that Great Game!!!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Ok, first I do have to say I am very disappointed in the ending and that we have to wait for two more books. I felt that we waited way to long for this book to come out.But I love the story,it was a fast pace reading that I did not want to put the book down.I wish all us ladies had a Gideon in our lives.PLEASE DO NOT MAKE US WAIT TOO LONG FOR THE NEXT BOOK!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Started slow but then once the drama started I couldn't quit reading.  Looked forward to opening my tablet every day
B0060AY6FO|5.0|a brilliant addition to the works of one of my favorite authors by another of my favorites. James captures Austin's spirit and brings her brilliance to life again in a style which is still clearly James--always a treat.

B00COGXGNQ|3.0|It's a nice movie especially if you don't already know the story (ie. if you've read the book) and you don't know what to expect.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|A Good Day to Die Hard- Good movie, watched it with the Hubby; He is a big Die Hard fan. Its Bruce Willis, cant really go wrong!
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|You have to watch this one twice in order to appreciate all of its merit. It is a must see for anyone into philosophical films. It will probably be nominated for an Oscar in the categories of makeup and costume; many on the actors are wonderfully unrecognizable. The stylized dialogue was appropriate and added believability.
1575666286|5.0|This wonderful book gives the information on how we may really live our life in good health, we have choices and to take on board the information in this book means you are seriously on the road to good health
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I needed to download this to get the ebook that was part of a pre-order bonus for Injustice, but it wouldn't download.  No matter how many times I tried, it would not work, effectively negating my pre-order bonus.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I prefer the face and quick over view of my last accuweather.  BUT after giving the new version a couple of tries I am very pleased with all of the information that the new one presents.  I think the new version is a home run but if accuwesther would incorporate the quick overview of the older version into this version it would be a grandslam.
B0017M413M|4.0|I like watching team work and unity, family like qualities.<br />I like that the script writers can &#34;carry on conversations&#34; in the scripts without foul language.
B008KP6ENE|4.0|The game is pretty good but on chapter 4 level 3 there is this part where there is a clip and to get it you have to go down but when you go down it automatically kills you
B001EZ2T7W|4.0|Nice twist for &#34;future&#34; ideas, like in traveling and the way choices we make can change the outcomes of our lives.<br />(though we'd never know for sure how things would turn out)
B004PVKFR8|5.0|When this first came out I wasn't impressed with any song but Sail. I have listened to it again and found that it is awesome.
B001I45UFC|5.0|Pass it down from generation to generation. Great book for the imagination. My son could not wait for story time every night st bedtime.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|Video came fast, played wonderfully in my system and I am super satisfied.  No complaints and I hope to do more once again
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Excellent acting by everyone in the movie.  Robert Deniro was great..  I didn't even realize he was in this movie.  The movie gives you an honest look into the world of someone who is dealing with mental illness.
B0095P33IW|3.0|I just got this service and so far so good, what is this I made my comment but you want more how BS
B008BU75IQ|5.0|As usual, kept me awake nights wanting to finish.  Archer is so good at these family sagas.  Easy read, good character development and anxious for more.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The Force good vs Evil.a chosen one a glipse of hope good turned bad a new hope a son vs his father and a return of a Jedi.
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should be able to make a creative work and then be able to turn It into a survival world, and on creative u should be able to put objects in chests, this would be a great upgrade,
B003IY48PS|5.0|This is probly the greatest scary movie of all time. Nothing compares. This can leave this day you watch in the dark by yourself.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Good book, well written as usual with Archer. Not quite up there with some of his best, but a great read.Looking forward to his next book... one of my favorite authors!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The graphics are sort of realistic. The only bad thing so far is that it takes for ever to earn money because you go through it so fast.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|Say goodbye to buying batteries for the Magic Mouse.<br />Awesome product.<br />I had bought one to be more eco-friendly and stop using batteries for my mouse.  It has now been a year and had to buy a second one for the mouse I use at work.<br />People always ask me what the little base is and look very excited and amazed that we have this technology now and that they too can also be less wasteful and never have to buy batteries again.<br />Extremely satisfied and happy with it.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|A really good fim I haven't seen Sean Penn this bad in a film like ever before, Josh Brolin is the stand up cop to just bring down Penn illegal Empire that has it's tentacles wrap around los angles.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Having waited for months for this book to see what would happen to the protagonists, I was delighted when it was finally published. although as I mentioned before, the characters and plot are very predictable, it is an enjoyable read. However, for those who expect the Chronicles to end here, they will not. Archer ends with a &#34;cliff hanger&#34; or soap opera ending which leaves the way open for yet another saga.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I have played this game on several different sites I have always like it.  It is a mind challenge game and that is good.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Liked the story line of this book. It was a little repetitive at times but overall a quick, fun read.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a great game.  Very realistic and fun.  My daughter loves this game and I do as well. I can't seem to put this game down!!
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I don't like it because you only 'do 8 rounds then u have To put in a Facebook account I don't have one
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|What the heck are the negative reviews talking about??? i kept waiting for this awful book, and it just kept getting better.There were so many questions answered and more mysteries popped up that i cant wait to see where they go.This was my fav book of the series because finally, Gideon and Eva could breathe a little,trust eachother, profess their true love.....and it was so gdamned romantic.I cant bekieve people who say they are totally into Gideon and Eva didnt love this book.Its to die for in the romance dept...and saying nothing happened???? What??? totally disagree!!! TONS happened! and the ending was great..I was terrified of a cliff hanger or something to tear them apart again but it wasnt at all. They still have aways to go(but i love where they are now) and i cant wait to experience the journey!!!! PS: I got into this series a tad late(Feb 2013) however, when did Sylvia say this was definitely a trilogy?I don't remember that at all..I always saw it as \\"Crossfire Series\\" and either way, Sylviaa explained all this pretty well on Facebook.how could anyone be upset there are 2 more books?? What is up with u people?? :)
B00D5O7BPU|1.0|This is not worth it, it's stupid, there are 6 guns and that's it, the original had 15+<br />Don't buy it unless you want very few guns
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Fast service and it was exactly what grand daughter wanted. I would highly recommend this game to everyone. Had a lot of fun building it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I thought this book would be, you know, a pornography but it's actually a very well written book. Some of the were even out of my vocabulary I had to look at th  definition. I'm very impressed with it. I'm sad that the trilogy has ended. I have to say th  book that I liked the best was fifty shades freed. It was a great read and I could not put the book down. Even when my kindle died I hurriedly grabbed th  charger and plugged it in. I loved it. I'm recommending it to everyone I know.
B0000UJFCO|5.0|This is a fantastic DVD. There's no Wakeman, Moraz or Downes playing keyboards but it doesn't matter. The symphony fills in what the &#34;melotron&#34; normally did with a good keyboard player at the realm.<br />The arrangements and timing between the band members and orchestra are tied together by Alan White playing drums. Ensuring both the band and orchestra are always tight, dynamic and on the same page the entire concert. I've never seen Alan so enthusiastic and he plays nothing short of the best I've ever seen. Alan White and Chris Squire are the entertainment in this DVD. Howe seems a bit bored at times and rarely moves or even smiles. He's definitely not playing his best on this one although he does have his moments as he always does. Jon Anderson is laid back, peaceful and seems to be enjoying himself.<br />There's one thing I find to be just fantastic in this particular DVD and that is the editing. It's quick and moving and times out great with the visuals. The absolute best I've ever seen applied toward a YES DVD.That's the reason for the five stars. It will keep your interested and entertained even if you don't know a thing about editing.<br />There are a couple of songs played that certainly aren't fan favorites and you might find yourself looking at the clock while they're playing the fist few times you watch this but they are over shadowed by some great versions of some great songs.<br />If you don't like symphony music backing up rock bands you won't like this DVD much. However, if you do like that combination you won't be disappointed. There's some great moments I didn't touch upon because it's meant to be a surprise as it was to me.<br />As a huge YES fanatic for the last forty years, I highly recommend this DVD.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Another great book from Sylvia Day. I couldn't put it down. Got a bit pissed off the way it ended. I NEED MORE NOW!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have a literature hangover from readin this book. I am having difficulties finding another book this good.  Please enjoy this book.
1607107325|5.0|Basil, who up until now was a mediocre painter after meeting Dorian Gray a young Adonis, was inspired to create a masterpiece of which he puts himself into. Against Basil's wishes, Basil's friend Lord Henry influences Dorian Gray.  Dorian looks at his portrait and realizes that while the portrait will stay young forever, he will grow old; so Dorian makes a wish that if only he could stay young forever and the portrait can age.<br /><br />At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted.  He falls in love with a beautiful young actor who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about.  Once again, due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.<br /><br />Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery.

0345803485|2.0|I lost track of how many times Ana \\"clambored\\" some place.  And how many times people \\"cocked\\" their heads.  And with the number of times Ana bit her lip, she should now have a hole where it used to be.<br /><br />This is not necessarily the fault of the author--it's the editors who take the blame here.<br /><br />And a college student who doesn't own a computer?  Ridiculous.<br /><br />At one point Ana mentions going to the cinema.  Americans don't go to the cinema--they go to the movies.<br /><br />Inner goddesses?  Give me a break--that's from the 90s!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's the best game on the kindle fire what's bad about it is that you cannot go to the nether world and it needs an updated please let us build a nether portal
B004T2QZL8|4.0|ok... the game was superb but it had some content not appropriate ....sex... you could put human +human equal baby but it equals sex ... nice ok...not nice for kids under 10
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a great read. I did wonder what I was getting myself into to start with, as it is written in first person of the 16 year old girl who this story is centred around. This story has a sexual abuse theme that is very well written and is not offensive. It also touches on how victims of abuse can forget what happened to them and can manifest into a behaviour they don't realise is affecting them.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|I hate it it doesn't work on my kindle when I open it it shuts down I might work for you but it doesn't for me
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love this game I couldn't put it down my husband and 15 year old son had to fend for themselves for a few days but they made it I can't wait to download another game from you guys
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|wish I knew it was a demo. I think 4.99 is kinda pricey but it was fun to play. maybe if it was only 1.99.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I first got this app for my Blackberry Playbook and was very impressed with it. The<br />Kindle version is just as good, and you only need one version of the PC server for all platforms. I have tried using it from a public Wi-Fi service and it worked well, response and performance are as good as if you were on the PC.<br />Back in the day remote control of the desktop required software that easily cost 10-20 times as much, and getting through firewalls was a nightmare and a risk.<br /><br />This an excellent work of software engineering craftsmanship!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This is kind of that rare app that really is useful and not just fluff! I even used it to test the cellphone charger in my car. Many apps I try are &#34;buggy&#34; when used with the non standard version of Android used on the Kindle but this one works fine. The only downside is that you have to go to the home screen and actually open the app to use it. Too bad there is not a shortcut of some kind.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series is action packed to the end!! I LOVE ALL of The Walking Dead series! Can't wait until Season 4!!
B009R659L8|5.0|I enjoy all her books, this one very  different.  Holds ones' interest until the end of the book. The characters are all great.,a fun book to read.and I dont mean funny as I mean entertaining. I could not put it down.
B005VR9328|5.0|This is an ambitious, fascinating album -- musically and lyrically great.  It reminds me of The Streets' \\"A Grand Don't Come for Free,\\" though that's (intentionally) musically much less interesting.  Undun's only real flaw is that it's too short.
B00992CF6W|4.0|it needs crafting on survival mode and  automatic updates but other than that its a great app.you should really buy it. its worth the money
B003G4W49C|5.0|Orson Card is simply a great writer. Anyone who enjoys an engaging story where the characters really come alive, will love any of Card's work, whether you are a Sci Fi / Fantasy fan or not.
B00821OX98|5.0|I tried this series because I wanted dependable entertainment. Alien invasion is a tried and true formula so I figured while it might not be Fellini I knew there was only so bad it could ever get. Well, I was surprised. This series has a few really inventive twists in it that really keep you interested. Most would give away the plot so I wont go into them, however here is one example - Earth is invaded by aliens, adults are killed, children are turned into slave labor zombies by the Aliens attaching a worm like insect to their spines. OK, sounds like a direct rip off of the Alien Face grabber right? It isn't though because they build upon that concept. The zombification of the abducted kids has way more about it than I can reveal here without giving away the plot, but it's done well. Does the series have a totally original plot? No, and it doesn't pretend that. Are the special effects really really great? No, this is not a CGI fest. Is the acting great? No. What is great is that someone put some effort into writing and putting enough plot twists in to keep you interested. I judge a series on how many episodes I watch after it is past time I went bed. One is pretty good. Two past bed time is something I haven't done since &#34;24&#34;. I did it with this one.

B00BCK1A5G|5.0|This is an amazing awesome story so so good I was always a bit unsure of Kaleb in the previous books but what a change and Sahara is totally wonderful so strong after what she has been through. A love that has lasted so long and just becomes stronger and so many things are changing in this world WOW I loved it
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|It was fun at the beginning but it totally freezes up my kindle after you advanced in the game.  It's too bad.!!!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Had my KFHD since Christmas.  Downloaded TOO many free apps.  Some good, most dumb.  This is both.  But it is the ONLY frapp I've played and played faithfully.  I am ready to forsake all others until battery drain do us part.  JUST. ROCKS.  Oh yeah, the key to earning money is to take the 4-wheeler to the moon and rack up on insane air times and flips.  You can earn far more quickly doing that than going for records.  I hate that the guy neck breaks, tho.  Needs to take a little of that cash and buy a roll bar.  Just remembered I've already posted a 5-star review for this.  Duh!  I love this app that much.  Sniffle.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I had not expected much from this book. Most of my friends had been disappointed and I read multiple negative reviews. So maybe starting it without high hopes helped me.<br /><br />I thought the book was an excellent ending to the series, wrapping up most of the major plot lines I had been worried about (thought to be fair some are wrapped up with only a sentence or two of explanation).<br /><br />The ending was unexpected to me, the battle scenes (which I usually fall asleep on) were engaging and I found the book fit well with the rest of the series.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the Wheel of Time series.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I loved it because it is great folk music.  With just 3 people in the band and sounds like 20 people.  Listen to this almost everyday!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game! If you like temple run than this is for you.  It changes to different places right now it is in Miami. It has been in places such as New York, Sydney, ext. Me and all of my friends thinks its awesome I have the kindle tablet edition. Definitely get it you will have lots of fun!! :)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Outstanding performance, visually excellent and a griping story.  Of all the productions I've seen I'd rate this at the very top!
0316287059|5.0|Wether you're a makeup artist or not this is a great read. Also a good coffee table book if you have a lot of girlfriends that come over.
B00CL6GAD2|2.0|Just not my type of film, difficult to follow the story line, and the only good thing was Mark Wahlberg.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Pay close attention to the story line. Its a love story that  grabs you and keeps you watching. The ending will take you by surprise. I'd have the tissue handy.  Well worth the rent and would definitely watch again.
B005OOSPZO|5.0|One of the great war movies of all time. The restoration looks fantastic. Skip the movie Pearl Harbor and watch this one.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|It was a somewhat fascinating story line but needed more depth. I found it a somewhat different twist on the normal ghost or demon theme in Horror movies. It was easy to get in to but dragged toward the end. One needs to pay attention to the plot to fully understand the story line. Well worth renting.
B0075CRQYY|5.0|I wish these guys would release some new music, but I never get tired of the songs on Steve McQueen.  Prefab Sprout was a very talented band.  Talented groups like this don't come around very often.  They're one in a million.
B000093BDX|5.0|Takes me back in time. My granddaughter went to school as Little surfer girl so I got her the CD.<br />She loves the music as I did.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|My daughters ask to listen to this in the car, at home, anywhere we can get the cd in, the piano guys are a first choice in our family.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a wonderful story with twists and turns that keep you hungry to see what is going to happen. Hugh Howey has a gift for laying out a scene that is on par with the best storytellers. His style is fresh and leaves the reader in that magical state of hungering for more.
1451675046|4.0|I think that The Magic of Reality by Richard Dawkins is a very good book. It was very interesting and well written. I liked how he told a couple myths at the beginning of each chapter to illustrate what past civilizations thought was true or what happened with the topics that he is going to address in the chapter. I also liked how he had many pictures in his book to give the readers a better idea of what is really going on.<br /><br />Although I liked the book there were some things that maybe could have been changed. I think that he should have taken out chapter 11 \\"Why do bad things happen\\" because the book is about reality and because so many things are real you have to stick to more relative topics like the ones discussed in 1 \\"What is reality, what is magic\\", chapter 4 \\"What are things made of\\", chapter 8 \\"When and how did everything begin?\\" and chapter 12 'What is a miracle\\".<br /><br />Overall though, I think Richard Dawkins did a very good job in writing The Magic of Reality and it is a very enjoyable book. I highly recommend this book to younger readers interested in science.
B009NY43NY|3.0|While the comments of most of the beraters are valid, I personally enjoyed a romp in the Sookie-verse for a final time.  I had by now forgotten most of the characters, their dramas, their strong/weak points, and enjoyed re-visiting with them.  I kinda wished more could have been made of Diantha and Amelia.  No one really \\"developed\\" 'cept maybe Sam a little bit.  Everyone appeared, did a schtick, and exited:  Barry, Bob, Mr. Cataliades, Diantha, Arlene, Tara, Bill, Pam, Karin....in and out.<br />But it was the chance to spend a little time with all of them, in Sookie's head, in Bon Temps, that made the book quietly satisfying.  No great writing here, but to me, it tied up and ended a great run.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|I have always loved the Die Hard series. With this one, they seemed to have started with what action scenes they wanted to have and then found a plot around those. A comparable movie would be Expendables 2.

B004JN1D2I|4.0|The books are fantastic, well written and complex. The only thing that I thought could be an improvement was that if buying the book set would download the books separately instead of having to return to the being of the file to navigate between books.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Given to some one  as a Christmas gift not sure if liked it, At least they did not throw it back at Me
B0089LOG02|4.0|Loved the unexpected friendship between the two women. The historical view of what an orphan may have endured during the train ride era was heartwarming and heart wrenching with hopes and fears of the unknown.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|For cost issues Peter Jackson had been forced to cut a lot from the trilogy \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"<br />Of course, given the success, had been allowed to make up a bit 'in the extended versions of the DVD (including the spectacular new pieces musical's accompaniment composed ad hoc) but many of the characters and scenes dear to the readers of Tolkien, however, were left out from the movies.<br /><br />With \\"The Hobbit\\", transformed from a little book for children in a new great new trilogy, Jackson not only tells so well pretty much everything but even managed to add some pieces!<br />And this without overloading the plot and the freshness of the original text!<br />Of course, much of the credit for the success of these films is due to the actors and the exceptional team of collaborators that Jackson has gathered around him but just the way that he led them makes him a great director and a great example of management.<br /><br />I can not wait to see the next two films in the cinema and then buy the other DVD to enter, as many times as I want, in Middle-earth.
B000I8HIV8|4.0|A good movie with some twists. Not too scary for younger kids 8 years old. One of the better family movies I've seen.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I like Star Trek, but I love that I can watch the Amazon instant video on my Sony DVD blueray player!
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|Cast was good but movie dragged. There were many sections that could have been shortened to pick up the pace of this film.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Enjoyed reading this 3rd Clifton Chronicle but am disturbed with the ending.  Does this ending mean there is a 4th in progress?
B000B5XOYI|5.0|I haven't watched this boxed set yet, as my wife is giving it to me as a Father's Day gift. I have seen all of the movies and I really enjoyed them but Iam pumped to watch the extras on these movies.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I watched an interview of the cast of castle and someone in the audience mentioned firefly and I decided to look it up, I'm glad I did, it started slow, but once you got to know the players and got into the show I was sorry it was over.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was truly an amazing read. I may need to go back and reread it because I read through it so quickly because I just needed to finish. The only and I say the only thing about this book that kind of threw me off was the amount of maturity that these two 18 year olds had....seemed a little misplaced but at the same time I also know that when your forced with adult situations you tend to &#34;need&#34; to grow up beyond what your age is. I recommend this book to every and anyone. I can't praise this book enough. It had me thinking about my first love (who became my husband) and our relationship and young love along with some very real hard situations that everyone of all ages can be faced with. Fantastic writing Colleen Hoover!!!
B009NY43NY|5.0|This was another great book!  I really, really hope it isn't the last.  I noticed some loose ends were left, so it gives me hope.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Loved it!!! I absolutely can't wait for the next book in this series to be released! I need Maxon and America to be together!!
B008YKGQR4|5.0|This app is as close to the PC version as anything else that is available. The only features missing appear to be included in the professional version. This is underpriced at $0.00!

B0067R0APK|1.0|Little news to the direct area that we actually live in.  Was not useful at all.  Not worth the money.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I think Mahjong is a great. I like to play, it helps relax me and sharpen my mind. I recommend it to everyone.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Nicely packaged box set. The movies are decent, any Harry Potter fan should have both the books and the movies to enjoy all year round.
B002Z58GQS|4.0|I bought this because I lose mine all the time and it said I could hook it to something. Indeed it has a hole but its only small enough for a thread like hook. And hanging that off my keys or something is not secure either. It works great, but not functional for someone who loses things, i need one with no cap and I can easily hook a key chain hook into it. Ive managed to hold on to it for a few months so thats progress
B0053Q9DQI|5.0|For certain pieces of work it takes time for me to love them. One for me was Pride and Prejudice, when I first read it, it was my least favorite of Jane Austin's novels-- and after re-reading it (along with all her other works) it is now my favorite. Jane Eyre also grew on me over the years. As I aged I gained an appreciation for the emotion and depth of the story, all the turns and pitfalls, the love for the characters. And who doesn't love a happy ending?<br /><br />So as I've perused through the many different film adaptations I've always felt something wanting. They never really captured the raw emotion of the book as well as the 2011 Focus Feature's version I watched tonight. I loved the way the story transitioned and the actors who played the parts. Of course seeing Judi Dench in any movie also tells you it's worth your time lol.<br /><br />This is the first film adaptation of the book I'm buying (rented it this weekend)-- gotta love amazon deals!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I dont know what she was trying to do if she was trying to milk for a fourth book but it just left me frustrated and really not liking the situation that Eva and Gideon are in. It just seems like they are never going to get over the hump and be happy and that did not work for me. Sorry Sylvia i like u but this book no good :(
1612680011|5.0|If you are determined not to live the normal life when it comes to finances, this is the book for you.<br />It's a great read that kick you in the behind and encourages you to get moving and be smart rather than work for The Man your entire life.
B007WFTFG6|3.0|my granddaughter can color. sometimes difficult to control the coloring.  but both children like this game well enough more control needed
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Lots of twists and turns.  The elements of the clues that build to the unveiling of the Symbol are clever plot devices and pure Brown. The book is more about the chase and less about character development. A fun read.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|The story grabs you and takes you on a peculiar journey that keeps you engaged.  I wonder now if I may have been in the presence of a true peculiar before...yes, I believe I have.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|I got it free from a kindle app store.This app shows exactly how much the battery left. Would be a good indication for long time readers.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Overall a great show, it will hook you from the first episode. The only down side is that I don't think you gave enough background to get you started.
B002M7KHO8|5.0|Very clever plot. Danzel as  usual  did a great acting job. This is a movie that keeps you guessing right until the end.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|This is one of the slowest movies I have ever watched. There is no shortage of explosions, car crashes, and gun fights but that will not carry a dull show. This movie never gets started. The characters are wooden and uninteresting. This movie should never have been made.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Warm bodies has a Great concept, though a little jumpy near the end. It is a great feel good overall. Funny, warm, and pretty decent acting.
B000A0GP18|5.0|I just love this movie.  Adam Sandler was a good pick for the lead in this remake.  Just too funny!!
B002GYS1FO|5.0|What a find these guys were.  I love this album (and The Glorious Dead). My favorite current band. Looking forward to seeing them live.<br /><br />Update:  Saw them live last night.  What a band!  Awesome!
B004PHSTY8|5.0|After 8 seasons, season 2 is still my favorite - exemplary in character and relationship development, full of emotional powerhouse performances, and strutting a good balance of season-wide plot and mystery-of-the-week.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini has such a gift for expressing all the emotion of life and love without bring overly dramatic, maudlin, or trite. This is a beautiful book.  I had to stop highlighting passages as I found myself literally highlighting the entire book.

B000ID37RM|5.0|Outstanding performances of an iconic American novel! Perfect in black and white. Missed a few key scenes in the book.
B009AMANH4|1.0|Terrible movie. Total waste of time. Boring movie. Poor plot. However, Daniel Day-Lewis did a reasonably good job. Would not recommend this movie to family, friends, and people I care about. I tend to watch movies which are selected by the Academy Awards for pictures of the year. However, over the past several years this has not served me well. I am sure there are people who will like this movie, I am not one of them.<br /><br />PS. I will no longer go by what the Academy Awards select as movie of the year as the past several movies have proven to be duds from my perspective. The Academy Awards in the US has loss credibility in my opinion. It's all political.

0374214913|4.0|Some novels are deep.  Some are thrilling and mysterious.  Some novels, like this one, pretend to be deep and try to be thrilling and mysterious.  One would think that this would result in a book that aspires to greatness but falls short.  That may be true.  On the other hand, Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore turns out to be a lot of fun.<br /><br />The strange happenings at the titular bookstore are enough to draw in the target bookish audience.  Clay, our narrator and protagonist, is at loose ends after being downsized.  He gets a job working the night shift at Penumbra's.  There he encounters the secrets of the strange owner and the clientele of the store--a literary mystery that has been chewed over for centuries.  With the help of his own collection of weird and wonderful friends, Clay begins to unravel the mystery.  Ultimately, the solution turns out to be a disappointment, though more for many of the characters than to the reader.<br /><br />Honestly, Mr. Sloan has worked his solution rather well.  There's no way the pay-off could live-up to the build-up.  Instead, he satisfies the mystery with normalcy and lets his characters do the heavy lifting.  How do people behave when modern technology is brought to bear on an ancient problem?  Mr. Sloan shows us traditionalists trying to hold their ground and Googlites trying to bash down the walls.  How does one react when the clues one has chased for centuries turns out to be something rather mundane?  Mr. Sloan shows us disappointment and retreat as well as satisfaction and the pursuit of new adventures.<br /><br />In fact, it is the way he works his characters that makes this novel successful.  Clay and Penumbra are both excellent; however, it is the array of secondary characters that really make this story work.  Corvina, Penumbra's nemesis, is a tower of ancient traditionalism.  Kat, Clay's girlfriend (?), is a Google acolyte gone wild.  Then there are the slew of strange personalities, some of whom come from Clay's world and some of whom come from Penumbra's world:  So different and yet so alike.  All of whom add different, tasty flavors to this stew of a story.<br /><br />In the end, this book feels a bit lightweight but is all kinds of fun.  It is not significant but it is enjoyable.  It reaches back in time but is firmly planted in the twenty-first century.  It is not the greatest story ever told but it is worth a read.ay's world and some of whom come from Penumbra's world:  So different and yet so alike.

B00D3CB41Q|5.0|An avant garde flamenco and jazz fusion of high production quality. Very nice to listen to, with several fast tempo tracks.  It doesn't get better than this.
0812533550|5.0|As followers of my reviews likely know, I rarely write reviews of well-known, classic books.  People likely already have hard and fast opinions about these famous titles which my lowly opinion is unlikely to sway.  However, I decided to write a few lines about Ender's Game for two reasons, the same two reasons I decided to read this again after many years: first, a big Hollywood movie is coming out based on this book and, second, Mr. Card has been getting a bit of press lately for comments that are rubbing people the wrong way.<br /><br />First, the movie.  I have high hopes for it.  I'm a fan of Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley and I'm interested to see how they handle this story.  Though it is true that movies are rarely even as good as the book they are based on, I always keep in mind that books and movies are entirely different animals.  I'm often able to appreciate a movie's qualities because they are so different from the qualities of the book.  I may think that reading The Lord of the Rings is an overall better experience, but I admit to loving the movies as well.  We'll have to wait and see how this one turns out.<br /><br />Second, Mr. Card's controversial comments.  However I may feel about his comments, it does not change the fact that he has created a brilliant novel in Ender's Game, and I rarely confuse the personality that creates great art with the art itself.  If we let our feelings about artists, writers and actors' personal behavior interfere with our appreciation of their art, hardly a work would be without taint.<br /><br />It's an unfortunate fact of life that there are times we have to compartmentalize if we want to enjoy life.  If you must, ignore the movie and the author, but don't miss out on this excellent novel.
B004SKJTY6|5.0|This movie was very good.  I found myself laughing as I can see the human side of everyone.  Saw myself in these situations and the reality of what goes on.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Lot's of fun! very addicting! wish it was easier to earn gems! I cant put the game down! wish there was more of a selection of horses and competitions!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|You can be upset with the author and the publisher all you want. Just remember that publishing is big business, and when we buy books WE create the demand for more. Since this \\"trilogy\\" has consistently been a #1 best-seller, you can bet the publisher wants to keep this \\"money-machine\\" rolling as long as possible. You can compare it to Hollywood. If a movie is a block-buster hit, then why not make more money with a lot of sequels?<br /><br />As a reader, I too was disappointed in this book and the abrupt ending. However, I understand that as a consumer I have contributed to this monster success. There would not be so many \\"series books\\" if we would just stop buying and reading them.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this procedural investigative story. Cruise is Cruise, but he doesn't get I'm his own way.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was a wonderful read that I couldn't put down. It's blunt and straightforward. I can't remember the last book I've read that  I laughed one moment, sat in deep thought, and cried all in one chapter. Beautiful book.

B006LSZECO|2.0|This story never grabbed me but I kept reading it, hoping that it would improve. I found the relationship very depressing and the book slow reading
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|It's a great game, pretty addicting. Way better when you have friends that play as well. Only con is the waiting. Which having friends that play also helps with.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its very fun.you basically learn am easy and virtual way to care for a horse.it can be annoying in some instances though
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book kept my attention the whole time. Well written and so deep and personal. I would recommend this book to anyone!!
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Too random . After 2 hours, still had no idea about point of movie. Jumped sround too much and lscked connectivity. Would not recommend this movie unless you are stoned.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|great book.  couldn't put it down.  kept you wondering until end and even then not so sure and another twist.  want to read his other books now.  waiting for the movie for sure.  visions of presumed innocent.

B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Lincoln was a great and wise man but the movie title was misleading.<br />There was much more history that was not covered.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|awesome beautifully written and deeply touching<br />it changed my way of the world, of love, and of how I see other people.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|The games graphics are really good and such but just bying stuff for the dang animal all the time sucks.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game but there is one problem not mojangs fault but Amazons fault. every update I look forward to amazon makes it late now I'm thinking of getting an ipad mini for Christmas.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|a good book!! an interesting concept and funny too! action packed with a simplicity to it. it was super good
B007PKDW44|5.0|This is an awesome album I remember the day my dad told me about warriors call randomly it played next day on way to school soi seated some songs on u tube and went by album from best buy I would recommend it to any rock lover
B00992CF6W|2.0|this version of minecraft has no updates. if it did life would be so easier. it needs the new update.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|takes a while, you must have paticence but it is fun. a real mind boggeler. I love the grafics and the music.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Every time I get to the part to log in to facebook it crashes so I cant play I would love to play this game. It is very frustrating because it takes forever to load this game.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Game is great fun and hard to put down once you get started.<br /><br />The character choices are fun and all the different tools and accessories that are available.<br /><br />&#34;A must have..&#34;
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|I think the Following is a great new addition to television. The dynamics of the acting and storyline are great. First, to collect some of the best actors around for a TV season is fantastic! Each brings a sense of professionalism and character to the roles they portray.<br /><br />The one criticism I have of the series though is the sometime preposterous situations that the characters get into. Stupidity abounds at times, and realism suffers when the directors decide to put the characters into tense situations without help. For instance, Kevin Bacon's character is often at the center of the gun-play or fight sequences, despite him not being an active FBI agent. Where is the backup? Often times, there are only a few FBI agents around (or one/none is some ridiculous sequences) and Bacon's character is leading the way and frankly, he has more kills then the entire force we have seen so far. I understand the leading character thing, but come on!<br /><br />Other than that though, the pacing is excellent most of the time, the characters strong (with good back-story representation with flashbacks - too many sometimes, but it definitely adds to the story richness), and the story keeps you engaged.<br /><br />I highly recommend the series, but you will need to leave your realism hat at the door with some frequency.
B00CW665VI|4.0|Fun perspective. I loved how the millionaire, manwhore loses his brain from unexpectedly falling in love. He's sick. It must be the flu. Drew Evans tries to evade the shocking truth. Here's where it gets interesting: the female characters in this book are strong and driven and have layered personalities, from Drew's bossy older sister to Katherine, the brilliant, young, woman who steals his heart. Great read! I look forward to seeing more from Emma Chase.
B000YGIIQI|4.0|Like most, I learned of Gordon Ramsay from his television shows. I was intrigued by his style, and overwhelming passion for perfection. He seems to have a keen eye for detail, and high expectations. As with every television series; the drama is high, as the focus is entertainment. I enjoyed the series \\"Ramsay's Best Restaurant\\" most, since it seemed genuine, and had limited drama! In any case, I was interested in learning more about Mr. Ramsay, and bought \\"Roasting in Hell's Kitchen\\" to get a more accurate depiction of this internationally renowned chef!<br /><br />The content of the book was what I expected, however, I had some difficultly relating to the vernacular (British English, not American English!), and some of the stories lost me as they jumped forward and backward a bit.<br /><br />However, all-in-all, this was a great book, and revealed what I expected; Mr. Ramsay is a talented guy who's hard work has paid off! I enjoyed learning more about his background and upbringing, as this explains why he is who he is.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn more about the man who conquered the culinary world.<br /><br />P.S. I'd love to see Mr. Ramsay featured on TED talks; he's got a lot of value to share!
B009HUB40Y|1.0|cannot open sometimes. Waste of time downloading something that I cannot use.  Will delete from my usage. do not like it.
0670023329|5.0|Gave me a wide spectrum of insight of what is going on in North Korea. I recommend this to anyone
B001B6PBBK|5.0|This movie was not your typical boring life story.  It was fun, funny whimsical and heart warming.  You couldn't help but to fall in love with the main character. And her friends were amazing,  every girl should have friends like hers. There was nothing not to like!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love it its like the real bingo but better but when they call the number its to fast I cants keep up!!!
0061684384|5.0|This book cover was  much more nicer than the previous one. I enjoyed both books just the same. Didn't read them page to page, just read them in a random order.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|some people just think this is stupid and I say that they should lock themselves in a stinky bathroom because this tame is amazing!!Great graphics and adorable
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|i read a few reviews before i made this purchase. my original mouse was R.A.T. 9 but one of the batteries broke. after i got this mouse i was disappointed because it is too light even after i put on all the weight. the buttons on the left side bother my thumb. i resell it to my friend for $30 and bought R.A.T. 7
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's a nice and fun app. Very entertaining and challenging for a mature daddy. 51yr still playing games and I am still young at heart. So it's a game for all ages:)
B001PJ7TUE|4.0|With every song I hear, I am pleasantly surprised. Most albums have only two or three good songs, but this album has 9. This, of course is my opinion. If you like upbeat electronic dance music with guitar elements, this is the album for you.
B006CBSE86|5.0|This is the soundtrack to a film by the same name. The range of the music goes from neo-classical to metal with some pagan influence. The band members play various roles in the film about an elderly composer suffering from dementia, trying to reach out to his daughter from within his imaginary world composed by Nightwish. Anette Olzen, the strong vocals sings in this film as the lead in Tom's band. Tuomas Holopainen plays Tom at age 47.<br /><br />The music captures the various aspects of this fantasy world. It is worth owning and watching.
B006RXPUR2|5.0|Starts off this lady is talking to these people. Then this guy is talking to another guy.<br />This this girl is talking to a guy. That guy starts talking to two guys.<br />Then the first guy starts talking to another guy who had been talking to another girl.<br />That guy knew a guy that was talking to a guy that was mad with another guy.<br />Then this guy and gal got mad and was yelling at a girl and a guy who found out that the one guy<br />actually knew the other guy when he said before he didn't<br />Three other guys get mad at a guy and are mean to him. So he pulls out a gun and hit<br />the second guy and then talked some trash to the first guy.<br /><br />  Cool Movie Enjoy
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Terrible ending! (SPOILERS!!!!)<br /><br />How do you kill off Prim, then have Katniss kill Snow, and then have Katniss vote for another Hunger Games? How Suzanne Collins? How?<br />The rest of the book is good but the ending is horrible. It gets very confusing in some parts but you'll figure it out. After you read this, make your own ending to it!
B003RV43X4|4.0|must see great effects and cool story. very close to the original with modern effects and extreme action. you should watch the entire collection.
B00CXN2JNS|4.0|Another Megadeth album that stacks up and equals to, but does not exceed, previous releases. It's a good, typical Megadeth album.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book was excellent. It was well written and the story line was perfect. It sucks that it ended on the edge now I have to wait for the next book. Read this!! It's the perfect addition to the series I can't wait for book 4!!!
B009Y6231U|1.0|Totally sucked. Silly, inane, stupid, waste of time, for the attention challanged, two hours of my life I will never get back.
B009K45Y62|5.0|This is a great addition to any collection. It looks awesome on the shelf and makes you want to watch the film.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|This movie has a good story line.  I like Barbra Streisand movies.  I thought the two main characters, Barbra and Jason worked well together in the movie.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I was unhappy to find out that the trilogy was no more and its been stretched out over 2 more books.  I made the mistake if reading the reviews which tainted my opinion and the spoilers had me with more questions.  I have to say how much I love Gideon he was so loving and so sweet.  Eva has some more growing up to do but I'm happy that their relationship has progress to the next level and that they will continue to work on their issues in spite of the past.  I didn't like all Hudson's exes coming out the woodwork it was overkill and Brett coming back I could deal but videos come on.  it was lots of other extended stories some good and others that could have been left out.  Loved all the hot steamy sex scenes every few pages.  Gideon and Eva mile high club my favorite. Will I invest in the other books remains to be seen.
B0047WJ12K|1.0|A pile of useless, boring, stylized, wooden, law & ordery, and longwinded acting, writing, directing, composing, special effects, and set design.  By the way, I'm writing this review with perfect hair from an illicit casino in Mombassa, because I heard it in a song once.  Good grief, it goes on like this for 2.5 odd hours.  Watch something else.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Somehow Daft Punk came out with an album that changes the way they created the music on the album, but it still retains that feel of Daft Punk music. Boom, headshot.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Don't let the seemingly complicated directions worry you, it only takes a few minutes to put the thing together and it works great.  Only note is, make sure you only go around the item (in one direction only) you're cutting ONCE ... if you go over the line more than once, it causes the items you're cutting to crack.
B009MCRHH6|3.0|Let me be perfectly clear: I love this game. I have played it on Wii, on PC, and on my phone. By far, the phone was the worst experience, but that's solely because of the screen size, so I lose a lot of touch accuracy.<br /><br />But the game itself is awesome.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|This album rocks. It's a not as fast as the other album, but it still has some nice tracks. Good job guys.
B008P9M614|5.0|There have been complaints from customers that have purchased this item that they simply repackaged each season's discs in new packaging and resold them at a discounted price. That is completely accurate, but I don't think that means the product description is inaccurate. The box doesn't promise any additional features short of each season's episodes and included features.<br /><br />That being said, I had already purchased each season individually. What I bought this for was for a gift for someone who didn't have any seasons on DVD, but desired them. The price was good for 8 seasons of any show on the market, and anyone who says otherwise is crazy.
B0084IHVC0|4.0|The movie was better than I remembered, well restored. Came as a combo pack which I always love. Good nostalgia.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|An exceptional movie about an exceptional lady. People of all ages will enjoy this movie. I show this movie to 11 year-olds. It really does an excellent job showing how someone with autism thinks.
B008JFUO0Y|2.0|I understand that Sam Raimi has said that this was the movie he wanted to make way back when but didn't have the money or the technology. That's neither here nor there. The thing is \\"Evil Dead\\" is the movie he made, and as bananas as its production was and as cheap as it was, it's enormously fun, more than a little shocking, and very atmospheric. The remake/reimagining, well, isn't. The story's legendary, but next to this new film being predictable, it's nothing we haven't seen before, which I found profoundly disappointing. All the hype about it, and upon the lights coming up at the end of the credits I regretted spending my time watching it. It's *only* a gorefest, garden variety. I wish it wasn't. I really, really wish it wasn't.
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|has about everything you could asks for. Comparable to poweramp. Takes little while to learn the features but worth it well worth the price
B00846REIS|5.0|Although there are a few similarities this Crossfire novel has its on twist. An excellent read. Page turner with every page. Give it an open mind and enjoy this novel.
0670026557|5.0|Give and take offers groundbreaking insights on the dynamics of personal interactions and the pros/cons of being a true giver. Not only that, it demonstrates using solid research the importance of knowing how to give in order to avoid falling behind.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Compared to book one this one is a little slower reading until the end when Eva starts putting things together. Be patient it is going to be worth it in the end.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Uses your flash on the phone to make the flashlight.  It will come in handy. easy to download and use.
B00BS4QP60|5.0|Love the album. Bought it when I heard him sing the lead song on TV. Don't  usually buy whole albums.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|This AS A BACK-UP to KAYAK is all you need. I found the information timely and accurate, as well as abundant.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Cool game!  Nice graphics and easy to get around.<br />The storyline was pretty good and easy to follow.  I enjoyed it very much.
0385347774|5.0|As a guy who buys on line for other people that are to lazy to do it; this is the book most often purchased by lady's; my wife loves it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game. But when is the update coming out? My iPad has a new update but I'm not finding it on thiz.
B000KK0AKU|5.0|I like both of these stars.  I don't know how I missed this movie when it was introduced. Anyone that is a  Kim  and Mickey fan should  watch this if they missed it the first time.
B002SAUCBC|3.0|Was an enjoyable read until the end. For some reason it felt rushed and I don't know why. I needed more.

B009GXHOW4|1.0|This app is a virus! It shut my kindle down and reset it twice in two days!!! Do not get it!!!!!!!  The app itself is cool, but shuts your kindle down. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|After seeing the documentary about Rodriguez, I had to have his albums! They did not disappoint! Real Arlo Guthrie style but better.
B00AK57N00|5.0|Okay, so I wasn't sure that I wanted this game or not, so I decided to do the test drive, thinking that it was repetitive and boring like most if not all of the one star reviewers said.<br /><br />And that IS what I thought at first.<br /><br />Ten minutes later, I have a totally different opinion.<br /><br />Yes, it is repetitive, but it is also fun! And, once you get to the later levels (which takes almost no time at all as long as you manage to keep at least one of your three hearts), it actually becomes challenging! Gravity changes, wind starts blowing, and the platforms vary in size, height, and distance apart.<br /><br />And then there's the addictive aspect to it. When I did the test drive, I thought I'd just play for a bit and then quit after a few minutes. Next thing I know, the test drive is over...You'd think that a game where you just touch the screen at the right time would become boring after a while, but it's actually the other two aspects that make it so addictive. Without either of the other two, I don't think it would be worth it.<br /><br />This is a rare combination of qualities in such a simple game. It's not for me (I have enough trouble with addictive games to begin with) but for those of you with stronger will power (or more free time) I definitely recommend this game.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Check out my review of Cold Fact! I think Rodriguez is fabulous! I can listen to his music for hours. After getting Coming from Reality and Cold Fact, I loaded them into iTunes and stored away the originals!
B008KP6ENE|4.0|This is a really cool game. At first I thought I'd be deleting it after a test run, but boy is it fun! It kinda reminds me of Super Mario and Pac Man: 20th Anniversary, with the portals and the cool stage at the end of each level.<br /><br />A couple of things I've ran into so far. First, the controls for movement are a bit difficult, particularly the left thumb movement. And second, it seems like it might be a little short.<br /><br />Other than that, I think it's a cute game, and a little more challenging than it first appears.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this game.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I would recommend this book to all dog lovers, since it's a book that is narrated by Enzo, the dog.  At first I thought it was going to be a little silly being written from the dog's view, but it really made me think about how much a dog sees and hears without being able to tell anyone about it!  A very funny, sad, and poignant book.  It will make you laugh and cry.
014242613X|5.0|My Daddy and I have read all the series thus far, of the Theodore Boone books.  We enjoy them very much, waiting on next one.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I usually don't write reviews whether I liked the book or not but this one ticked me off so much that I had to put my two cents in. The thing about this book is that nothing happened! At no point did I have any reaction (laughter, tears, excitement). And the fact that it ended with absolutely no resolution to any issue was the worst part.<br /><br />Sylvia is either money hungry and trying o drag this out for everything it's worth or she's trying to one up 50 Shades of Grey. Either way it was a poor decision on her part.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to this book but I actually had to push myself to get through it. Needless to say I won't be buying the next one.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is great and lots of fun. The critters are cute and do amusing things and having the squirrel popping up keeps it very entertaining.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I had been a fan of Angry Birds, but I really started loving Angry Birds when Space came out. The idea of gravitational pull based on planets gave the game a great twist.
B00CS65JS2|1.0|Feeling v sorry for the hundreds of thousands of people who will buy Random Access Memories on the strength of Get Lucky.<br /><br />Daft Punk are sadly pedestrian and unimaginative on every single track except the one(s) Nile Rodgers took rhythmic and melodic control of.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Enjoyed it from beginning to end. I can't wait to see what's next. Each book is better and better. More please
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I waited 6 months for this garbage! It didn't even come close to being as good as the first two books. I would have rather her taken her time to write a better storyline, then to write this lack luster book. I'm so disappointed. I had such high hopes :(
B000BYA5GO|5.0|Great movie. Nicholas Cage at his best. This film depicts our need for bad guys in our worlds culture. A must see.
B0053TMP24|5.0|My son really enjoyed this book. I think he red it twice by now. He couldn't stop talking about Greek gods for 2 - 3 weeks.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|Not only is this a thoroughly brilliant motion picture with many famous sequences, but it's perhaps the least disturbing and most entertaining of Hitchcock's films. Cary Grant is at the apogee of his off-kilter coolness, and one scene after another demonstrates the powers of the master artist Hitchcock in complete command of his medium. The Ernest Lehman script is outstanding. Even the Saul Bass title sequence is &#34;iconic,&#34; to employ a now-ubiquitous word. The pic hurtles into motion with amazing swiftness, through a Byzantine sequence of events which sweep Grant into a world of narrative he does not comprehend, directed by a group of mysterious government agents who contemplate his fate like Olympian gods. Don't forget Bernard Herrmann's great score here, and Eva Marie Saint, though scarcely memorable as the romantic foil, serves her purposes well as one of Hitchcock's blonde placeholders and pawns. James Mason is fine. There really is--for the viewer who wants an introduction to what makes Hitchcock tick, and yet what makes the cinema a collaborative medium--no better place to start than North by Northwest. And although the plot is complex, it's so much so that it approaches the comically inscrutable, and the minimal doses of violence and Hitchcockian neuroses make this, as the phrase goes, fine family viewing--of what just happens to be a deathless and hyperkinetic masterwork of the talking cinema.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|A little on the short side (timewise) but it had a nice mix of speech and story not always found - a nice way to spend an evening. The side puzzles were all different and probably best of all.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is a great game overall, you can do many things in this game. The update that came out a few days ago, it is understandable that it would take a bit. They most likely were working on it for other devices because they are more popular. This version will probably take a week or two. During that time, you guys could read &quot;How to Be Patient&quot;.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|A must read for the twenty-something set. So applicable and the best \\"looking glass\\" I've seen yet. I would suggest that every college grad gets a copy before heading out on their new adventure. Men and women alike!
B002NN5F7A|5.0|Great movie, really portrays the motivation to develop top producers.  This is about sales and not the mamby pamby let me show this nice leather interior and shiny wheels mentality that the concierges call sales.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is the third book I've read by Khaled Hosseini, and all of the were masterpieces. To say he is a brilliant writer is putting it mildly.  His deep insight into the characters and their emotions is spellbinding. In this third book, there are many, many characters and there are stories within stories that sometimes are a bit confusing, but everything comes together in a beautiful woven tapestry.<br />His writings give deep insights into the psyche of the Afgannie people. Their deep pride and love of family.<br />It helps us understand what the ravages of many wars have heaped upon people who struggle just to get through each day.<br />I recommend it very highly. Couldn't put it down. I had to keep telling myself to slow down, because I didn't want it to end!<br />Dee Campbell
B008742O32|2.0|Will not work on Tab 2 with all suggestions tried from the forums. samsung was no help So it goes.
B000088E6D|5.0|This album has a good selection of songs, and Michael Buble sings them all wonderfully in his own inimitable style.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|The depth of this universe alone makes this book worth reading! And the fact that I have to wait until November to read the next book is the only negative experience I have had while reading this book.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|Working with children with autism made me curious to read this book. Once I started, I couldn't put it down! Not only is it a great story, but also gives a fantastic insight into the mind of an individual with autism.
B003RV43X4|3.0|I am a big Greek Mythology fan and was really excited to see a newer version on this film but was disappointed. The special effects were pretty good but I felt that the storyline was a little weak and there could have been a little more excitement. It didn't help that I actually paid extra to watch the 3D version of this film and it was basically nonexistent. Be wary of any movie that is retrofitted to add the &#34;3D&#34; effect because it will probably not be worth the extra amount you pay.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Can't wait for the next season, they always leave you wanting more! I thought there were some great new characters as well as more of the ones we love, Dean and Castiel!!!
B00992CF6W|3.0|What if kids get addicted? My friend doesn't want to play outside anymore and it's summer! I like the app but I don't like people getting addicted.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was amazing. Love the 3 d effects. My kids were playing with me and they loved it. I can't wait for the next one.
B0096HID5M|3.0|Ok, Julianne Hough can sing...but too many scenes were staged around her hair, the angle of her hair, the changing hair between every blink!  This movie reminded me of the Olivia Newton John and John Travolta movie, &#34;Grease.&#34;  Tom Cruise was great, the slammin' love scene with Maikin(?) she's so beautiful, was ok, he needed to have more steamy sex scenes - as the sex-god rock star...
B0094K1MH2|3.0|This movie takes you back to a different time and place. It's like a European comic book.  Oh, wait --- it IS a comic book.
B0064MT1LM|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie it's a must see in my opinion. Great acting even with the sometimes bad fake southern accents. Be sure to check out the special features and pick up a copy of the book as well for a really good read.

B00CW665VI|5.0|I love to read books from the POV of the male.  It provides you an interest twist in things.  Now, this novel was just something else!  It was fun, sexy, arrogant, and just with the necessary display of love that makes you swoon.  I just wish I find more books like this.  Excellent book. I don't tend to write reviews but I just had to for this one.  Bravo!
B007IV1E2W|5.0|This is one of the best seasons I've seen yet! I recommend it to everyone, if you are just about to check out Dr. Who then I wouldn't start on this season if do to like season 2 or 3 and go from there

B005JZBPHS|2.0|Purchasing The L Word: The Complete Series was the best purchase I have made! :)<br />but I am not happy with one of the disks (Season 5 Disc 3) is has some scratches on the cover (the gray with the title and lettering) It will not let me skip or play one of the episodes. Other than that little thing..<br /><br />My girlfriend and i loooove The L Word and are happy to have,basically at our fingertips! :D
B00ADQPB50|5.0|*Minor Plot Spoilers*<br /><br />Season 2 is a huge improvement from the ghost story of season 1. Not to trash the meticulous craftsmanship and brilliant acting of the original, but, the problem there was substantial: Not one character to root for or engage with on an emotional level. AHS: ASYLUM, on the other hand, provides several sympathetic \\"heroes,\\" wonderful villains and is so deeply moving by the end, it becomes an unforgettable drama-thriller classic.<br /><br />Of course, you get plenty of \\"nut-house\\" chills (including two very intense scenes of electro-shock treatment), but the show-makers wisely don't confine this chapter to the ground. Many other horror tropes play supporting roles: Aliens, mutated cannibals, Nazis and the big baddie himself, that's right, The Devil.<br /><br />It all works perfectly and the actors and writers all deserve awards. Bring on season 3: COVEN!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hours of fun.great app.all ages.you could play all day.fun.updates alot.different place everytime.basically all u do a man chases u but uve to run like a obstical course of trains.i advise you to download it and its free.
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|Just when I was lamenting the fact that Kate Morton didn't have any other books right now, along comes this author!!  This was written in a haunting Gothic style that was riveting.  At first it was a little slow starting, but hang in there, the twists and turns and suspense are wonderfully done.  I, too, as another mentioned, want to reread it.  (a lot to see if I missed hints to the outcome?)
B009O5CLZY|5.0|I am loven this app,play it all the time. I even turnd a few friends on to it.down load and enjooy as much as u can

B00BLRXDTQ|5.0|It's been long overdue for this one.<br />Roadwarrior comes with losesless audio btw which is really great.<br />Beyond Thunderdome just seems like a whole new picture. Great remaster esp the video transfer.<br />Couldn't be anymore happier with this purchase.<br />I'm so thrilled. Would've been nice if there some more substantial extras.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|this is a great app for my kindle, it allows me a visual &#34;dashboard&#34; gauge type of reference for battery level
B008J2GAKU|5.0|Out of all the DC comics New 52 reboots, this is my favorite. I loved Green Lantern, Vol. 1: Sinestro, and that is one of my favorites, but this book takes the top spot.<br /><br />This is Batman at his best. Not only is he the Batman we all know and love (Dark, Brooding, Obsessive,and Determined) he is enhancing the tech in the Batcave and his suit. I love seeing what technology the writers come up with. Bruce creates contact lenses that will do facial recognition because they are directly linked with his super computer. There are of course other new additions but I wont spoil the surprise if you like the technology of Batman as much as I do. Batman to me has always been a combination between James Bond and Sherlock Holmes, and it is very prominent in this book.<br /><br />Bruce Wayne is being hunted but the Court of Owls, and they sent an assassin named Talon who seems less than human. Bruce has looked into this fairy tale before and can't believe that they exist. He has to find another answer, or come to terms that the nursery Rhyme that he has known as a child might just be true. The story is amazing and I am waiting on pins and needles for the next installment to come out in a graphic novel. There are a few things that link other characters in this story that were very intriguing. I feel like I can't do this book justice in this review so let me say this. If you are a fan of Batman this is a must read. There is a little history that if you haven't read Batman in the past you will be missing, but for the most part, since this is a reboot the story can stand on its own and still be amazing.

B00070Q7VO|4.0|Not as good as his first album, however if you like Buble, then this will do the trick for you.
B00AK57N00|4.0|Whee!  Your little Tarzan swings through the air as he jumps from platform to platform.  When the game starts, your stick man is standing on a platform.  He grabs a rope, and then swings over towards another platform, which is lower down.  The game continues through a series of platforms, each one getting lower and lower.  The game went so quickly, it made me a little dizzy (LOL).  On each platform, there is a bulls-eye, and you're trying to hit the middle as closely as possible.  You have to have the correct timing when you let go of the rope, or you will crash to your death... \\"AahH!!\\"<br /><br />The platforms change sizes, and they are not at consistent heights, so you have to adjust your jump as you go. The music is annoying, but you can shut it off or turn it down.  The gravity changes and the wind changes, so you have to adjust to those factors.<br /><br />Beware!  It's not as easy as it sounds.  Remember, close only counts in horseshoes and tiddly winks...
B002XXUWMI|3.0|First let me say I did enjoy this movie - it was entertaining if you accept it for what it is. I read a number of reviews saying this movie was superior to The Matrix, which came out a year later. The only thing I felt they had in common was in both movies, another type of being was controlling all humans and creating a false existence. The Matrix presented a  slick, high tech fantasy world filled with ultra cool people & it had great, cutting-edge (at the time) special effects. Dark City is basically a film noir and that aspect of it I liked, but then it mixes in a sci-fi element with cartoonish aliens that can control everyone's thoughts & memories.. It felt like an episode of the Twilight Zone. William Hurt is very good as the police detective but Keifer Sutherland's character comes across like a spoof of a mad scientist including a strange, stuttering voice.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|You will enjoy season seven if you are a fan of Dexter. This season they went over the top. Wow!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Everything is great about Minecraft except the upgrade is hard to find on the Kindle Fire Hd.Any help e-mail me at squeak1230@textnow.me.

B0044RUSZM|5.0|Looks good with my macbook white, and all of my aluminum accessories. stable, supports a lot of weight. i put my friends mx18 on it and it was still stable (once we got it centered) High quality for $30. not sure if i would get it for anymore then that however
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This set was well collected and well done for anyone who loves the serial, Downton Abbey. We were sure to watch all discs before season three aired and will certainly purchase it as available. PBS did a great job in the quality of the materials in packaging so keeping discs safe and at hand is easy. Bring on season four!!!
B00CL50LEC|5.0|it was a good movie, i would recommend it so give it a try and maybe watch it with someone you love.
B00992CF6W|4.0|But the updates are weird and the &quot;creeper&quot; is jusr a standing up green pig LAZY! The graphics are all sqares and i just wish it had all the things Xbox or pc versions have!
B0064MGU98|5.0|My friend kept raving about the show but I just didn't have time to watch it when it first came out. Thanks to Amazon Plus I now can watch this show from the start. Excellent acting, writing and fast paced.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|It was great.  The ending was a real supprise.  i like sorties that deal with real issues.. i  loved it

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am looking forward to the next book after reading this one.  Eva and Gideon are such interesting characters.  The books read fast and are a page turner.  The drama never ends
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Very addictive, it makes you to think about solution. You can't stop to play. I recommend this game. Good work.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I showed this to a few friends and they thought it was really weird, but I love this! I downloaded it to my Kindle Fire when it was the free app of the day. I blazed through the first 50 level (first 2 sections) in 2-3 days. It's challenging enough without making my brain hurt, but not boring to the point that I never want to play it. If you're a puzzle game lover, you'll dig this.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is hysterical! She tells seemingly normal stories with her own little spin, and you are left laughing out loud (seriously...people looked at me oddly as I laughed out loud.)  I will say that it is not one continuous story.  I saw that a lot of people did not like that. I see it as a hilarious collection of random stories and thoughts. I also saw that some found her quite egotistical. I didn't see that at all. I think Tina Fey deserves credit for her accomplishments and is allowed to bask in her glory. However, she doesn't do that. Quite frequently, she acts as if her good fortune is due to pure luck as opposed to her comedic genius.  I will definitely recommend this to friends, and I would read any future book by Fey as well.
B008JOLG7U|5.0|Great songs includes current ones. If you like Jennifer Lopez, you definitely need this album/CD in your collection. Love me some J Lo!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|this book really keeps you going and the ending is great the way it all<br />played out--excellent-I highly reccemend it
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Loved the characters and the language of the people of that time..loved the ending such a great way to show the strength of human nature.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|i already have a swype app installed on the latest version of andriod, so this app was of no use to me anymore and i am sure it would be of no use to you anymore either
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|It's a fun game that can or can not take up a lot of time. I also like that it's easier to get &quot;aura's &quot; then other games.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I enjoyed this book a great deal. As a professional woman balancing a career and motherhood, I relate to her words. It's a great read for any woman, especially anyone starting out in a career. I will want my daughters to read it when they get to the right age.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day is the most wonderful author. I just loved this three book in the Gideon and Eva series. Just can't wait for the next book. THANK YOU SYVIA DAY!!!!!
B000NA28IE|5.0|This is a great book series & the movie just adds to the fun.  Have your kids read the book 1st & then celebrate with an Eragon movie night!
B00CHILW64|3.0|I've enjoyed Naomi Watts in every movie I've seen her in and was looking forward to The Impossible.  However, it would seem that her performance here was based on the rigorous physical demands of the role rather than her innate acting talent.<br />The movie was an extrordinary achievement since I believe,it was done without a ot of CGI.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is awesome I like it because it is very creative and it is fun to explore. Some times I make hotels, water parks, a zoo and hoses.
B00CL6GAD2|2.0|I thought Russell Crowe was miscast as the Mayor.  Mark Wahlberg, as always, had a compeling role, but I think this was just a paycheck for the two of them, er... three of them, I should say.... Catherine Zeta Jones was also miscast as Crowe's wife.
0140120416|5.0|I'm very happy with this book. I wanted to learn Russian over the summer once so I grabbed a few books from the book store. This was by far the best. I was able to get through the first 4 chapters on my own. After that I joined a class at my college that uses a different book - and i still refer to this book almost daily. Its great on its own or as a helper to other books.<br />The part I like the best is that is phonetically spells out all the vocab words. You get a good sense for how to pronounce the vocab without even needing to listen to each word on Google Translate.  It is also small, and compact(the size of a standard paperback) so you cna bring it anywhere with you.<br />Definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to learn russian!
B000RH0C8G|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Mr. Lewis' books since Liar's poker.  This book didn't let me down.  It was nice to get his take on something outside of &#34;normal&#34; business and wall street.  While the movie was good, I liked the book better.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book.  I'm shocked by the reviews.  As much as we love Gideon and Eva, their story continues.<br />Why would anyone complain about that?
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I have enjoyed reading this series by Oliver and I wish it wold not have ended.  I have ben able to emerse myself in this wold and nevr wanted to let it go!
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I like it alright, but it is so weird on a kindle. I am better off using the Bing thrown upon me.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Twist and turn.  Fast pace, who is going to get found out.......though I love this show I hope they can push these characters forward with some needed growth.  For a club that is about the whole, they all seem to be about ME. Which keeps getting them in trouble.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Well written book about one of our country's true heroes.  I was inspired by the life of Adam Brown and captivated by his story.
B001V7UXG2|4.0|We have watched these episodes multiple times and this edition (despite what various naysaying reviewers are saying online) is superb. There are layers of character development and witty scripting throughout the series, not to mention strong acting. They are sufficiently faithful to the Wodehouse books and at this price are an unbeatable bargain.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This book is nothing compared to the first two. If the next book takes as long to come out as this one, I may loose interest all together.
B00932A4XE|4.0|Better than I expected it to be. But not a great movie. It kept my attention which is more than I can say for other movies with J Lopez
B004AUGJS8|3.0|Based on the true story of someone named Durst...Too many details left unexplained, which didn't ADD to the suspense at all.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Should be more energy but besides that it's a great game Gallegos how you. Can work on keeping good energy an I like how you can do just about anything so much fun an sokes up time
0062082353|5.0|If you don't like this book, you've got issues! This is the story of a man who put EVERYTHING on the line for his country, multiple times. He did it for his love of the USA and he did it well. You really get to feel what it was like, not only for Mr. Kyle, but for his wife while he was on deployment. I never met Mr. Kyle, but I would carry the trash to the curb if his wife asked me to, purely out of respect for the man that he was and the things he did for our country. RIP Mr. Kyle.
B005ILWOZA|5.0|Love his voice and writing of the songs. Would recommend it to friends. Wish he was known a little better in the states.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I was purchasing Cowboys and Aliens  and a season of Castle for my daughter's 18th bday, when a salesperson suggested if I liked those, Firefly was a must-see.  Devotees of the show are still mad it was cancelled after the first season, and now I know why.  It really was entertaining.
B004WPYNY8|4.0|At first I just thought that Symphony X could done so much better. Because I think it's a Paradise Lost rip of. Well I shouldn't said that should I. The first song just pounds you with that awesome riff, and it does take you to that Symphony X heaven. Then found the rest of the record to be a little boring. Same thing over and over same tempo, same thing. Then I heard the three last songs on disc two. Oh my god! They should putted those on the first discs. They are so amazing. So if you're going to buy this record, don't settled for the one disc edition. Buy the special two disc edition instead.
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|My children love this movie.  we purchased this item online, and Amazon makes it easy to watch on our kindle fire.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was the best book I have ever read! I will definitely be reading the second an third one. Loved it!!!
B000055Y0X|5.0|It's a Stanley Kubrick Masterpiece that has a theme that still holds true to this day. It never gets old and for once in a while you can watch it again and again alone or with friends who have never seen this one before.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|rovio made a great job with the licince you should check it out it is a lot of fun there are 5 planet right now and more coming soon it is on the appstore it is $2,99 for the hd virison and $0,99 for regular virison Thank You!

B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love wonder zoo!! It is challenging but fun and easy to use! It never gets boring because there is always another animal to find!!!
B009UHHELM|1.0|I specifically looked to make sure this was the US version of this show, but apparently the information on this website is faulty. I saw in other reviews that it didn't play well with Panasonic players, well... it doesn't like Sony either apparently. My player recognizes the disk, but the content will not play. I am EXTREMELY disappointed that I can't watch it.<br />Amazon, seriously. Please fix this.
1781162646|5.0|I just finished reading this book.  I still have tears rolling down my cheek.  Joyland reminds me so much of a long gone amusement park...Bertrand's Island, in NJ.  Mr. King can still pack a wallop !  He has not entertered my nightmares in a long time...until last night!  and wearing of the fur!  I hope this novel introduces even more readers to him.<br />Don't hesitate to try this story.  You will be happy you did!

B000Q99EAC|5.0|The first Rocky is the best. Oscar winner missed in Philly with shots of the city, what's not to like.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Okay time to be honest. Before I started reading this book I had some skepticism because of some of the negative chatter in the book world. Yes I'm guilty for not staying in a little Crossfire loving bubble before reading it. Sue me, I'm human. And the negativity freaked me out. I read BARED TO YOU and REFLECTED IN YOU before I started this blog so I don't have reviews on them. To give you the cliff note reviews on them I will say that I ABSO-FREAKING-LUTELY LOVED THEM. So when there was talk of bad reviews I got scared. Would Sylvia Day do me wrong? Would one of my favorite series be ruined?<br /><br />Well I managed to block out the negativity, avoided reading any reviews and put my big girl panties on to finally sit down and get reacquainted with Gideon and Eva. And I am damn glad I did. I didn't just love this book...I am enamored, smitten and besotted (yes I looked in a thesaurus for these terms) with it!<br /><br />Before I start, I need to say that if you have NOT read BARED TO YOU or REFLECTED IN YOU, I strongly recommend you stop reading this review and go buy these two books first (purchase links below). Next, I need to say that this is a spoiler-free review. I promise I won't give away the farm, you're safe with me. Let's begin...<br /><br />The story. I'm going to go as far as saying that I think this is the best book of the series so far. Yep I said it. The entire book is pretty much ALL Gideon and Eva. Yes, you still get to see everyone else in the Crossfire world. Cary, Eva's parents, Angus, Corrinne, Brett, Magdalene, Christopher, Gideon's mom, Megumi, Mark - they are all there. And you even meet a few new faces. However, this book was about Gideon and Eva - their relationship, their feelings for one another, their trust in one another, their love, their communication, them dealing with obstacles, just them.<br /><br />Reading their story was like being in a room with clouds, rainbows and ponies - you didn't want to leave. Ms. Day took a lot of time with these two characters and showed so much character development that I fell in love with both of them more than I already was, which at one point I thought was impossible.<br /><br />Every issue that was brought up in the first two books were addressed head on. There was no subterfuge, no drawing out of an issue, no skirting around an issue to deal with it later, no running away. I got more than I would think to ask for and then some. This book was clearly planned out and tied together a lot of the missing pieces by answering lingering questions.<br /><br />I could sit here and gush about all of my favorite parts, but I don't want to spoil anything for you and I have no doubt you will not be disappointed. Just trust me...this story was perfect.<br /><br />Gideon. I think I can go on for hours about the Gideon we see in this book. This Gideon is different, still the same commanding, challenging, absolutely gorgeous, damaged man, but he's different. He's honest, trusting, romantic, endearing, open and dare I say...perfect?! Let's not tip toe around this here. The Gideon I met in the first two books was fantastic, but he had issues and he screwed things up with Eva more than a few times. Hell, he \\"broke up\\" with her in Reflected In You and was \\"with\\" Corrinne. Well let me tell you, Gideon has cleaned up his act and is prepared to atone for his sins.<br /><br />The amount of love and devotion that Gideon has for Eva is indescribable - hell he literally killed for her! He would do absolutely anything for her and he made sure she knew and saw this in everything he did. If I ever doubted Gideon's commitment to Eva, every single doubt has been erased. I think Ms. Day just ruined me not only for all future men out there in the real world, but I think in the book world as well.<br /><br />Gideon has to be one of the most damaged fictional characters I have ever read about. My heart broke for him in the first two books, but in this one...I just don't have any words. UnlikeEva, Gideon is still living in his nightmare of a past and dealing with the demons they bring. But, with the help of Eva, he is able to heal a bit and very slowly. I am hopeful that by the end of the series Gideon will have found peace.<br /><br />Eva. Oh Eva how she has grown. In the prior books, I liked Eva but her insecurity and poor decisions always annoyed me. Just like this Gideon is different, so is this Eva. This Eva has strength, confidence (in herself and in Gideon) and clarity. She knows who she is and she owns it. She's still fiesty and stands up for herself to Gideon, Cary, her parents, and any other adversary. She's rational and reasonable and it is very easy to be in her head because her thoughts make sense. I think that is what made this book so amazing. Being in Eva's mind and seeing everything from her perspective was so easy to follow and understand.<br /><br />Gideon & Eva. As much as I loved the past two books, I had my doubts about these two a few times while reading them. Sometimes I wondered if it was just a physical attraction that drew them together. I questioned whether their relationship would be as strong if the sex wasn't as good. All those doubts were thrown out the window with this book. The level of understanding, the magnetism they seemed to have to one another, the ability to know what the other is thinking, the lack of boundaries, the complete and utter honesty between them, the playfulness and banter, the balance of power, the acceptance they had for one another. It all just BLEW ME AWAY. Together these two can conquer anything and I look forward to seeing where they go in the rest of the series.<br /><br />Because this book was mostly all about Gideon and Eva, there was a lot of sex (would you expect anything else from Gideon?). And I mean A LOT of it. Normally, repetitive sex scenes tend to bore me and I feel like sometimes they are used as fluff by authors. However, not Ms. Day. She managed to keep me entertained, engrossed and envious in every single scene that she wrote.<br /><br />Because Gideon & Eva have such an intense connection, their physical scenes are equally as intense and explosive. As a reader, I felt the emotion behind every touch, taste and kiss. These two characters have histories of horrible sexual abuse. To see them exploring each other and taking one another to different heights sexually was breathtakingly beautiful. They were wonderfully written scenes and I would not change a single one - they were necessary and 100% added to the book's plot.<br /><br />There is NO CLIFFHANGER in this book. You know where Gideon and Eva stand with one another and you have no doubt that they were meant for one another. However, this is NOT THE END of the Crossfire series. There are two more books on the way (dates currently TBD). For those speculating on the motivation behind the additional two books, they should have their doubts erased after reading this book. Although you are content with where Gideon and Eva leave off, their story is by no means over. There is still so much more to explore and address. If Ms. Day writes Books 4 and 5 the way she wrote this one, I may be begging her to write another two! Bring it on!<br /><br />So I wholeheartedly recommend you read this book, especially if you read the first two. I do not recommend you wait until the series is out either. Why deprive yourself of an absolutely amazing book out of principle? This book was single-handedly one of the best books I have read all year. Sylvia Day hit it out of the park with this book and I cannot wait to see where she takes the story next.<br /><br />This review was originally posted on Book Reader ChroniclesEva, Gideon is still living in his nightmare of a past and dealing with the demons they bring.

I questioned whether their relationship would be as strong if the sex wasn't as good. All those doubts were thrown out the window with this book. The level of understanding, the magnetism they seemed to have to one another, the ability to know what the other is thinking, the lack of boundaries, the complete and utter honesty between them, the playfulness and banter, the balance of power, the acceptance they had for one another. It all just BLEW ME AWAY. Together these two can conquer anything and I look forward to seeing where they go in the rest of the series.<br /><br />Because this book was mostly all about Gideon and Eva, there was a lot of sex (would you expect anything else from Gideon?). And I mean A LOT of it. Normally, repetitive sex scenes tend to bore me and I feel like sometimes they are used as fluff by authors. However, not Ms. Day. She managed to keep me entertained, engrossed and envious in every single scene that she wrote.<br /><br />Because Gideon & Eva have such an intense connection, their physical scenes are equally as intense and explosive. As a reader, I felt the emotion behind every touch, taste and kiss. These two characters have histories of horrible sexual abuse. To see them exploring each other and taking one another to different heights sexually was breathtakingly beautiful. They were wonderfully written scenes and I would not change a single one - they were necessary and 100% added to the book's plot.<br /><br />There is NO CLIFFHANGER in this book. You know where Gideon and Eva stand with one another and you have no doubt that they were meant for one another. However, this is NOT THE END of the Crossfire series. There are two more books on the way (dates currently TBD). For those speculating on the motivation behind the additional two books, they should have their doubts erased after reading this book. Although you are content with where Gideon and Eva leave off, their story is by no means over. There is still so much more to explore and address. If Ms. Day writes Books 4 and 5 the way she wrote this one, I may be begging her to write another two! Bring it on!<br /><br />So I wholeheartedly recommend you read this book, especially if you read the first two. I do not recommend you wait until the series is out either. Why deprive yourself of an absolutely amazing book out of principle? This book was single-handedly one of the best books I have read all year. Sylvia Day hit it out of the park with this book and I cannot wait to see where she takes the story next.<br /><br />This review was originally posted on Book Reader Chronicles
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I have been reading for over 30 years, first time I have ever asked for a refund. I wish I could read the original story that was going be release back in Dec. I feel that Ms. Day was told to rewrite the story so there would be book 4 and 5.
B007SGM084|4.0|Not what I was expecting at all.  Holy hot stuff Batman!  There were times I thought my Kindle was going to burst into flames due to some of the action! I was warned by other reviews, so I was given some warning, but WOW!!!  I am no prude by a longshot but even I blushed in some cases.  It was definitely researched in great detail, which is a big plus.  I can totally understand why some readers were put off.  It is definitely adult reading, no Twilight sugar-coating here!  This trilogy is for mature readers only.<br />Ok now on to the review.  I loved the fact that we saw both P.O.Vs of the story, not just the female perspective, like in most books in this genre.  The characters were not just one-dimensional and bland, but full of self-doubt and wonder.  They were both allowed to grow and organically come together and not forced too quickly, say if it were in only one book.<br />This set of books may not be for everyone due to subject matter, but for those who can get past that, this is a great series.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|Looks like a bunch of art students in college made this as a project.  Too stylized and the story is poorly retold.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|This was an awesome movie...kept your attention every step of the way! I can't wait for the next segment to come out...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love playing this game in my free time! It is addictive and thrilling! If you have the original Temple Run you will love this one even more!
0812983459|5.0|A surprising book, as will find out as you slowly read and aren't quite sure how this book might end. And end it does, to the last page, a very appealing read. Very thought provoking.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love love love this app and it works great on kindles...and also on any other devices I have tryed enjoy!! &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|Great sound from the Kindle Fire 1st Edition. Generous selection of titles. So glad I found this. Trying to figure out if I can save some of the songs to listen to, offline. If you like smooth jazz, you'll love this streaming audio.
B004WGIXX4|2.0|For a RomCom, there was not much comedy and romance was not very believable. Happy I did not spend money to see this at the theaters.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This game was on the display of a Kindle Fire in our local Staples. Every time I went in the store, I had to play it. This game is what led me to own the Kindle Fire. Since owning the Kindle Fire, I have found it to be a useful tool, as well. Very portable if you don't want to carry a laptop around.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good summer read at the camp. Bring a snack a drink and some attitude. You will not put it down.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I you liked &#34;Myst&#34; you'll love this! You have to use your observational skills and memory to unlock a series of &#34;puzzles&#34;. Finding trap doors, collecting odds and ends for later use, and keeping you eyes open for secret panels, levers, and patterns. It only takes a few hours to get through, but if you like brain teasers then go ahead and try it out! I can't wait for the next Room to come out.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am not a Stephen King fan by any stretch of the imagination. That being said, this novel captured and held my attention from beginning to end. It is one of those stories that you wish would never end.
076115678X|5.0|Great book on how to work with all types of curl, all the do's and don'ts are in this book! The how to talk to you stylist and how to cut it yourself is a big help too!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I will read anything put in front of me that is written by Hugh Howey. The Silo Saga has been so fun to read and I can't wait for more!
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|This movie was AWFUL! Do not watch it. If it is free, still do not watch it. Watching this movie is like watching paint dry. Lately Bruce Willis seems to be walking through movies, rather than participating. There was zero chemistry between father and son, zero excitement or surprise. I can not even think of the right words to express just how bad this movie is. It definitely ranks in my top 10 of all time worst.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I remember seeing individual shows on cable but didn't. Really get it until I started watching the episodes on prime. Very entertaining.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|The book kept me entertained. It read it in 24 hours. I waited what felt like an eternity for this book...only to be left wanting more. I'm kinda annoyed there is another book that I have to wait for.
1401203078|5.0|I thought this was stronger then the other ones personally. Loved the Tempest and Virginia Woolf references. Orlando is one of my favorite characters and glad to see him/her in the League books. Having the name Vita as a woman was just perfect. I thought this one was the strongest because Moore reference books you would have read in English classes both in high school (such as 1984 and the Great Gatsby) and ones you would read in college such as (Gulliver's Travels and the Tempest). I would say this volume is really more for people who actually read more English books that aren't in the horror or science fiction genre. Maybe the reason I like this one better.<br /><br />My only issue with this volume is that it jumped around too much. It made the volume more confusing. However this had more of my favorite literary characters such as Gulliver, Prospero, and Orlando. So giving this a 5 star for the usage of the English novels, but should be 4.5 I think.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Very detailed book!  Learned a lot about Lincoln and the others. Provides some little-known facts about Lincoln's rise to the  Presidency.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I will be honest I too was upset about the release date being pushed back from May to June. But it was only a month, it was better than waiting another 6 months for this book. And for the people that are giving this book a bad review b/c of the way it ended, and the release date: SHAME ON YOU! In my opinion this is by far the best book to me so far in this series. I am totally not upset that there is going to be 2 more books. Why? B/c I am in love with Gideon and Eva! I don't want their story to be over! Sylvia did say that it was going to be a trilogy but she also said that if she couldn't get it in 3 books then there was going to be 4 books. There are still questions that need to be answered! I wanna know more about Gideon's past and about the new \\"twist\\" in Nathan's case. So to sum up my review I will read every every book that she puts out about Gideon and Eva! Oh and if you are going to write a review on something make sure you at least have read the book. Don't write a bad review b/c you don't like that you had to wait and month longer for this book and didn't read. It wasn't Sylvia's fault. Keep them coming Sylvia!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This series had, by far, been at the top of my list of favorites before this. The closer I got to the end and realized that things were not rapping up the more upset I became. Day could have easily ended the story and given the readers closure in 3 books. I am beside myself as to why she didn't. 2 more books....REALLY!!! I think she made a huge mistake. Setting proper expectations and then meeting them is the first rule in any business. The readers were expecting a trilogy and then were left hanging, very upsetting! I really cannot say if I will read the last 2 books. I would love to have closure but right now I am so upset about having to wait and purchase 2 more books that in the end of I might just let this one go. Sorry, Day, but this was a huge miscalulation by you, or your publisher, or maybe both of you.
B003UD7JEE|5.0|This is a remake of La Femme Nikita and way, way better. While the acting in La Femme was fine, the casting was poor. Also the background music was never quite right in the original series. All that is fixed in Nikita. And while I say this is a remake, it's not an exact copy. The people have the same names, and the agency is the same from La Femme to Nikita, but the episodes are all different and up to date. La Femme is okay and just barely worth watching. Nikita is riveting with each episode leaving you begging for the next. And don't let the cover picture fool you, this isn't a raunchy skin flick.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|This film came highly recommended and I wasn't disappointed in the least.  Great characters and music.  The make up was also incredible.  I almost didn't recognize Samuel L. Jackson.  He was another person entirely.  Of course, a Quentin Tarantino film never disappoints.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|A revealing exploration of the human psyche and the indomitable human spirit they the story of a young man with a buried memory.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I had already started to reduce my wheat consumption before starting to read this book, but it has scared me into wanting to go totally wheat-free. I have already experienced some lessening of joint pain, and if even half of what Dr Davis says is correct, I look forward to other health improvements. The information he presents appears to be well researched.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I must say I do enjoy Gideon & Eva. What's not to love of two people so madly in love they would do anything, sacrifice everything for each other. Gideon commands presence, it's undeniable. And Eva, she is just a firecracker, love her sense of humor and great comebacks. Once again were taken on a sexy, lustful adventure with Gideon & Eva and what a fun ride it was. I enjoyed the characters although I felt the storyline was rather empty, it was missing the depth of the first two books. Enjoyable anyway, you will not be disappointed.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Cool game and I can see why the franchise did so well.  Keep up the good work Gameloft.  I think that you are doing a great job with your apps.
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|This book was worth the waiting and did not disappoint.  I polished it off in two six hour sessions.  It got the main plotlines moving again, in a way they have not moved since Lucas and Hawke's books.  While some of the plot twists were not wholly unexpected, they were most welcome, and I look forward to the next book, maybe Aden or Vasic meets a nice Changeling girl?  And the interaction between all the different races was phenomenal.  It was also nice to see beloved members of the changeling packs again.  Very good read and I wait breathlessly for the next instalment.
B006RXQ2CY|4.0|This was well worth watching. I was impressed by the smooth integration of news footage and newly created scenes about the death of Princess Diana and the royal family's response to that tragedy. The acting was very good and the cinematography had plenty of eye appeal. Loved the Corgis.
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|It was exactly what I needed, ordered, delivered in a timely fashion, no damage.  I would order again if the need arises.  Too bad the others haven't been released extended.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|Funniest book I've read in a long time. The oatmeal is a comic genius. A must read for every one
B0041D843M|4.0|The China Study provides a rebuttal to diet plans such as Atkins and South Beach, but tellingly it's not located on the same shelves as these books. You'll find it in the nutrition section. Campbell is to diet and nutrition advice what John Gottman ([[ASIN:0609805797 The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work: A Practical Guide from the Country's Foremost Relationship Expert]]) is to relationship advice (a scientist who provides a reasoned analysis of what works after investing a lifetime of the research in the subject and walking the talk in his own life). It's sound advice not sensational.<br /><br />The China Study won't tell you anything you probably didn't already know or intuit about what to eat. Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are good for you. Eat a variety. Don't go hungry. You can't get enough of these healthy foods.<br /><br />\\"Eating should be an enjoyable worry-free experience, and shouldn't rely on deprivation,\\" Campbell says.<br /><br />What is startling though is how good these good foods are -- so much so that the preventative effects of these foods trump genetics. They stave off heart disease and cancer. These and many other diseases are not inevitable, but can be prevented, even treated, by eating only healthy foods. Campbell makes the case in chapter after chapter of compelling research.<br /><br />For an interesting comparison read this with Ray Kurzweil and Terry Grossman's [[ASIN:0452286670 Fantastic Voyage: Live Long Enough to Live Forever]]. Kurzweil also argues that illness and infirmity are not inevitable with age although his approach relies on a barrage of supplements and technological innovation. Kurzweil says technology will save us whereas Campbell says nature provides. Noting the appetizing color of fruits and vegetables that contain the antioxidants, which shield our bodies from disease, Campbell says, \\"Whether you believe in God, evolution or just coincidence, you must admit this is a beautiful, almost spiritual, example ofnature's wisdom.\\"<br /><br />Campbell also offers some behind the scenes insight into how nutrition information gets researched and passed on to the public and why we get mixed messages and confusing information about what to eat (Read his book [[ASIN:1937856240 Whole: Rethinking the Science of Nutrition]] for details).<br /><br />But \\"good food and good health is simple,\\" Campbell says. He boils all the studies and research down to one sentence, \\"...eat a whole foods, plant-based diet, while minimizing the consumption of refined foods, added salt and added fats.\\"
B00CDT41RY|3.0|It started with a good story but then disintegrated into a shabby action picture.I simply can't recommend it to anyone.
B00AYB1TP0|3.0|Any advice? I bought the app after my daughter told me she loved it but now after paying for it I cant download it.
034580404X|3.0|So many people saying it's a great book that I went ahead an ordered it...<br />If I would'nt be living on an island, I would of borrowed it, never bought it.  Ordering books to D.R. comes out expensive for the weight.  And reading it is a big deception!  &#34;Holy Crap&#34; and &#34;Holy Cow&#34; seem to be the only vocabulary in this repetitive book!!<br /><br />Of course I'll go through the 3 books because I paid for them, but definitely not on my &#34;favorite books&#34; list.
B00130UFY2|2.0|This movie's photography was very poor, it was so bad it gave me a head ache. one of the worst Damon film's I have seen.
B0058SNKNS|5.0|I ordered them because some girls that came to stay at my B & B each had a pair and they told me they were very comfortable and practicle.  I live in Dom. Rep. and I guide tourists in many muddy excursions and I needed something lighter than a boot and better than a sandal.  Regular imitations of Crocs exist but there is NOW WAY I would be seen wearing those big cloggy shoes for retards.  So it really surprised me that Crocs made these cute niceley designed shoes.<br /><br />They came in in less then a week and the package was so light for shoes that it cost me no more than taking a letter at my CPS counter!!  And finally getting to wear them; perfect fit and walking on a cloud and cute looking on top of that!!! Now I have to admit that I NEVER would of thought that of a croc!!!  Very, very satisfied.  For a shoe that cheap in cost, you can't go wrong!!!  I'm a Croc fan now and just can't believe it myself!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read this whole series  One of the best if you liked action packed, suspenseful books.  Can't wait for the next one
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved this trilogy it was amazing! I believe that Suzanne Collins is the best writer ever and she has the best way of putting 26 different letters together.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|Saw the show in person in savannah..great evening..DVD is a reminder of how great the show was!!Recommend it to everyone,ESP.if you enjoy Irish music
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|When I downloaded this app all you could do is pet the cat and hit the cat it didn't do any of the other things it was meant to do.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is the best game I have ever played. All y'all hayrrs out there been drinking some haterade and it probably tastes nasty.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|It's pretty fun and it mostly guesses the right answer. This game is also really difficult sometimes because it will repeat something it has already said.
B006IGZX0C|5.0|This was a great movie! My fiancé and I thought it would be great to watch this at home.  We were not disappointed.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This is a very thorough and easy to read  dictionary. The descriptions at the very beginning explaining the pronunciation for the alphabetical letters was most
B008FTAAG2|4.0|I heard one of the songs a few weeks ago so I downloaded this lp and wow... Her voice is amazing.
B00CFO7PK2|3.0|I had others expectatives, I know her style. I like her music more slowly, I like her more siging in Spanish
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I always wanted my own horse and now I have it lol. Lots of fun, very realistic. Definitely recommend it :)
B0063GORYU|5.0|Lots of fun and never boring. An addicting game that also will work with or without wifi on my Kindle
B007N31YH0|5.0|I purchased this DVD to replace my old worn out VHS.  My family and I just love this movie. We watch it over and over again.
B009PAETCG|3.0|fun. tough to score!! I like when guys scratch their nuts! Beer and pretzels like verbs too. right? Who's with me on this?
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I loved this book.  A little slow to start but definitely got going and is totally worth it!!!  Would give more than 5 stars!!!
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|Another absolutely amazing CD by the Piano Guys! I am a proud owner of both their CD's now and both are worth every penny! I bought this CD and have not stopped listening to it since I bought it! I have to say that my favorite song on this CD is &#34;Happy Together&#34; but all of the songs on this CD are worth listening to over and over (and over!)
B004G0SJU8|5.0|this has to be one of my favorite movies.  i really enjoy both Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan in just about anything they are in, but this one was especially touching.
B00CDXOXB4|4.0|Romance and Suspense .The story engaged you enough to entice you to anticipate the next scene , development of the characters as well as the ending of lhe story.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|This movie probably isn't for everyone. But being a mom of adult children and one teen on his way, it was a good laugh. Touching movie, great actors. I enjoyed it!
B00985E3UG|4.0|If you read this book you will never again be duped into believing the food industry has your best interests at heart.<br />This could be just the information you to need to free yourself from your addiction to salt, sugar and the bad fats that sicken us instead of supporting our health.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Great movie about people facing personal challenges and overcoming them with the help of others. This movie was also rather funny.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|Not enough time and the game is kinda boring. Some of the stuff is pointless and you die too easily
B002MCJZHS|4.0|Great album and a great band. I listen to them before bed. I am a hip hop type of person but I like the minimal approach of the XX when I just want to kick back and relax.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|A VERY enjoyable game, everything from the storyline, graphics, mini games and video footage are excellent. It kept me going whilst of work due to illness. I look forward to a sequel.
B005RAO0GS|4.0|Florence is a great singer. Powerful voice and vocal range. You buy this album for the whole album, not just a few songs. Amazon was selling the MP3 download for $5, an absolute steal.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This is a great introduction to Jack Reacher.  I was drawn in by the movie and even though I think Tom Cruise is a little short to play Reacher the personality is dead on.  Killing Floor is a truly engaging story.  While a tad predictable the best part about any of these books is learning about Reacher himself.
B00821OX98|5.0|It feels a little like a soap opera but it is a GREAT soap opera! Good writing, action, and special effects. Definitely worth watching!!!!
B00555X8OA|5.0|I have enjoyed this read. I see myself having to adjust my thinking so as to not jump to conclusions because of this work.  Has really helped me professionally and personally.
B004UPANGM|2.0|I did not see Evil Dead original but this movie was &#34;B&#34; rated horror at best. Maybe Evil Dead original is better??
B0074EIQUG|4.0|Bought it for a preview because going to see Sonny Landreth and Dr. John is the headliner.  Can't say that I loved every song on the CD but I like most songs.
8866130915|3.0|I thought I would like this little handy planner. I found out soon that it was a little too small for my needs. If I didn't misplace it I was struggling to write in such a small area. Good quality but just not right for me. I ordered the 81/2 by11 size and love it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book of the Hunger Games trilogy is even better than the first, although Katniss, the protagonist, seems to be more of an emotional liability than a take-charge heroine. 04-2012
B009CF7GRY|1.0|If it had close captions I would have enjoyed it.  I was not able to enjoy this movie even after trying to view it several times.<br /><br />captioning would have given it a five star.
B00COMLLX2|4.0|Great graphics and  each pinball game is unique but it needs to remember my initials for high scores continuing to reenter them kinda annoying
B000PMG16U|5.0|I-III are good they just do not compare to the original three.  This is the best deal I have found on the prequel though.  You can not get a better deal.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|But it takes too long to gain energy and the bigger your town the less you can do with it because you run out of energy. I was enjoying it but now it costs too much to fix things including people animals and buildings. It is becoming frustrating. Considering uninstalling.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Pretty disappointed. I found myself skimming parts (yes, even the sex scenes, which is why I buy these kinds of books). I didn't really care as much about the side character storylines, it just felt like they were filler stories. And I found myself really disliking Eva after the whole Brett thing. Seriously, she invited him up to her place where he hits on her and she plans to see him again? She even let him nuzzle her neck. And yet near the end of the story when Gideon took Deanna out for a drink to smooth things over, he at least took her to a public place, and Eva was still upset!<br /><br />The only real upside to this book is that Sylvia writes quite beautifully. These are the first books of hers I've read and so I may venture out and read something else that she's written.<br /><br />Will I read the next two? I dunno...I'll likely forget about them by the time they come out, but we'll see.
B00006JSS8|5.0|Bought it for my fiancee. She loves Stevie Wonder and there's a ton of songs on here. Definitely a nice gift.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game I am actually addicted to the game. I like the people that are on the game they are funny....
B007JNWQZS|5.0|great movies and an even better deal when they come together. these are classic movies to own and tarantino fans must own.
0345533054|5.0|This book was insane! Just when you think you know... you couldn't be further from the truth. I couldn't put this book down. It grabs you and tosses you around like a rag doll. In the end you will be blown away! READ THIS BOOK!
B00AK57N00|5.0|AWESOME GAME. ITS SO AWESOME.....I LOVE IT AND IF YOU THINK ITS BORING THATS JUST YOU BUT I LOVE GAMES LIKE THIS
B004P8K1WU|5.0|'Poor Economics' should be required reading for anyone who complains about homeless people wasting their money on cigarettes and alcohol. It's easy to look down on people with low or no income and pontificate on the ways they ought to be behaving. Banerjee and Duflo take the path with more moral and intellectual integrity, developing an analytical picture of why people in poverty (all around the world) make the choices they do and what policymakers and NGOs can do to help them improve their quality of life most effectively. It's an enlightening read that has also shaped my own choices of which charities to support.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Worked great makes life much simpler. Able to work from the couch rather than the desk. Would definitely  tell my friends and have them install.
0156027321|4.0|I'm not a regular reader; I'm just starting to get back into reading, and this book was a good place to start for me.  It's an easy read, teaches some good lessons, and is even humorous at times--why not read it?<br /><br />Like some others have said, I loved the beginning background probably more than the lifeboat story, and wish there was more comparative religion..<br /><br />However, the book was good and definitely worth reading.<br /><br />**POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD**<br /><br />I was drawn into the book.. I didn't realize the author's note wasn't a real author's note (it was in italics like the \\"author's\\" words in the rest of the book) so I honestly believed it could have been at least based on a true story.  I still don't think any total impossibilities were contained in the book...<br /><br />Other people said they knew from the beginning it was too crazy to be true, and these were people who take much of the Bible literally.<br /><br />Personally, being fooled into believing such a story may be true made me realize just how easy it is to convince people that the events of the Bible and other religious texts actually occurred.<br /><br />After reading this book and watching the movie \\"The Man From Earth,\\" I have to say that I really don't believe very much of the bible anymore.  Fairy tales build churches (from TMFE, and people don't want to believe stories about god(s) that aren't extraordinary, so that's what gets passed down for generations.
B00CTEMQLG|4.0|Fun, great music, entertaining. some predictability to plot and character interaction which is aggravating. But generally just great fun to sit down to this show after work
B00BESM14U|3.0|I enjoyed the movie! Was surprised by the ending and saddened. but I would recommed it.  Though again when I am watching it th emovie stops have way through and buzzes. Last one i rent. every one does that on my brand new TV.
B004BRQYJ4|5.0|This movie has it all: music, dance, Great vocals, intelligent plot, romance, a handsome &#34;villain&#34;, and a happily ever after ending. Just plain fun and enjoyable to watch over and over.
1781162646|5.0|One of King's best books. Set in a small North Carolina coastal town in the early seventies, Joyland is an amusement park of the old sort before corporate entities took over amusing children.<br /><br />Devin Jones is a college student who takes a summer job at Joyland and gets more than he bargained for. Already in a strained relationship with his girl friend, something he knows inside, but not ready to admit. He makes lifelong friends, gets involve with a murder mystery haunting the track, and meets a young mother with a crippled, really dying, young son.<br /><br />Four years before a young woman had been murdered in the horror house and it was still unsolved. It was said her ghost still haunted the place, never seen by a customer, only the occasional employee after hours.<br /><br />Dev desperately wants to see this ghost, but only his friend Tom sees her. He stays on after the summer to work full time, taking a year's absence from school. That's when he meets the mother and her dying young son. The boy has the sight and during a special visit sees the ghost. Dev doesn't, but it leads him on the right, dangerous, path to find a killer.<br /><br />Most excellent. Technically this would be a horror novel, but it's so much more.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I enjoy watching the drama of the story.  The costumes are outstanding.  The dynamics of the characters interactions are complex.
B008KP6ENE|1.0|It's buggy made my kindle freeze up and I am having a hard time getting it off the device. So I  you have  a kindle don't get this app.
B0059XTUEK|5.0|I saw it in the theatre the first time.  Michelle Williams does a great job of capturing Marilyn Monroe.  I like Eddie Reymayne in this film too.  Check him out in Birdsong.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|We love all of these episodes! Great acting, drama, funny and interesting! I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!
B00465I17E|5.0|I replaced my DVD of this movie with blu-ray.  I really like Denzel Washington in this movie.  It is inspiring and captures a piece of the 60's and civil rights movement that wasn't as well known.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|I have an introvert for a husband.  He enjoyed it and is really trying out the tips, which were informative and really common sense.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I've enjoyed other Ken Follett books, but this is my favorite so far. I was glued to every page - and there are a lot of pages! My husband read the hardback version but it was too big and heavy for me. I bought the book for my Kindle. Fabulous read, and I learned a lot about pre-WWI and WWI. Can't wait to read the next one in the series.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I can't wait for the movie to come out just to see how much of the book they put in it
B002C949KE|5.0|I cannot say I was particularly interested in the subject this book treats, but I enjoyed every part of it. The experiments described by Dan Ariely proved to be very interesting and the manner of writing makes them easy to follow and extremely enjoyable.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I really LIKE this game but I can't spend money to get gems. Is there anyway to get free gems...like by watching videos, downloading other apps/games, or doing offers? When it becomes easier to obtain free gems, then I will give it a 5.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|A delightfully sweet and quirky fairy tale that reads easy and smooth as mysterious buttered rum. .Like a cinematic version of<br />\\"Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell\\" meets Cirque de Soleil...
B00AEFY3MC|5.0|Loved when it first came out.  Loved seeing it again.  Delightful parody/homage of the original Star Trek.  Sweet, funny well acted movie.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|I laughed, cried, shook my head in dismay, and felt anger.  It is a memoir that touches all the emotions.  Just about the time I was feeling depressed by the poverty in McCort's life, I would come across a passage where I had to laugh out loud.  The story about his communion and throwing up God in his grandmother's back yard was so funny I had to read it to my husband.  By telling the story  through the eyes of a child, the reader catches a glimpse of the innocence of childhood. Sometimes that innocence is funny and some times poignant. While McCort's life was very difficult, there is always a determination to keep moving on , a determination not to give up. It is a wonderful read that I highly recommend.
B0029EDMEG|4.0|Homicide cop, divorced and drinking, interviews for a position as small town police chief. They hire him, not knowing what is inside. Murder and shady doings follow. Selleck establishes a baseline for droll, savvy and unpredictable detective work. No, you will not figure out who draws on Jesse at the end, or how he faces them down.<br />Watch the interplay between him and Boomer.<br />Great start to a clever series.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Nice app, just wish you could change the clocks color  instead of just being blue. Other than that this app is worth the purchase price.
B008YZ4RR0|5.0|Although films are known for abbreviating the author's work, there are multiple threads anyway. No car chase or CSI magic here, just assembling the puzzle pieces. In this, the bodies are piling up, and they interrupt the pursuit of a rape thread to follow the killers as they stalk.<br />Viola Davis really comes into her own here as a strong support to the chief. Orla Brady continues as the chief's love interest. This time, you know who kills, the problem is halting them. And the ex continues to call him and interfere in his life. Selleck really makes this character his own during the interaction with townspeople and suspects....
B00821OX98|4.0|This is an entertaining show, I think the plot is very interesting, but some dialogues and acting are pretty s***ty, I still can't wait to see what happens next though, and overall it's been getting better and better as the show goes on.
B00AATFJK2|4.0|Westworld is a science fiction movie from the early 70's about things gone horribly wrong at a robotic theme park of the future.  How wrong?  Well, unfortunately a few of the park's guests don't leave the way they had planned.  Westworld was derived from a story written by Michael Crichton and the movie was also his directorial debut.  Westworld was produced in a time before filmmakers felt the need to club moviegoers over the head with graphic violence and foul language so if you need these to be entertained then Westworld may not be the theme park vacation you are looking for.<br /><br />I'm going to assume that most people who are reading this review already own a copy of Westworld on DVD and are wondering if buying it on Blu-ray is worth it.  To those folks I can happily say YES!  I found the Blu-ray transfer of this movie to be much cleaner, sharper, and the colors brighter than the one on my old DVD copy.  It's actually kind of remarkable considering how old the movie is.  Seeing it cleaned up and in HD was like watching a movie filmed today.  Also, there are 2 short special features included on the disc.  They are 1) On location with Westworld and 2) a 1980 TV Pilot, Beyond Westworld.  These are both offered in standard def and look pretty terrible but at least its something extra.  The disc menu is functional but rather plain.  If it had been a smidge more interactive I would have been tempted to give this Blu-ray 5 stars.  I hope this was helpful.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|Charged well but I would not use on a plane due to RF. At 10 feet it will stop a digital TV using an antenna.  The charge rate indicator lights are a bit confusing also, i.e. is four dots full or empty, nothing printed by them to indicate.<br />It will charge a 4G iPhone from flat to full in just a couple hours.  RF issue aside, it's a great device at a good price.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I simply loved this book! I cherished each and every page and was sad when it came to an end· The story telling was sublime & the characters are sure to leave an indelible mark· A must read!

B00915G6WQ|5.0|If you love the previous Dexter episodes, you won't be sorry with this one.  There is only one more season to go.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I was extremely excited to start this book. I believe that whole story line was good with some turns that got your heart racing and made you think \\"OH MY\\". Eva & Gideon, yeah they're a cute/dysfunctional couple that you just want to see where they will end up. But sometimes the over dramatic scenes are enough. I would recommend anyone who has been following the series to read this novel, but I'm going to be honest and say you won't fall in-love with the characters in this novel. And the way Ms. Day left us hanging, just not right. Hopefully the next two book will be way better than this one, or maybe she should have just ended it at this novel. Guess we will have to wait and see.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|Ellie's &#34;Lights&#34; song has become so over played and has gotten old, but the rest of the album shows how much more talent she has. Some songs more mellow and each song different.

B00D6BQPMM|2.0|I had seen the trailer several times, and it always got me curious about the movie. It seemed wit, funny and nice. However, all the jokes that were shown in the trailer were seen in the movie within the first ten minutes, after which the movie start to seem very dull.

B009G3T01M|1.0|Didn't have explicit content on music or song. Be careful before you buy or  download. My daughter asked for this song. I have deleted the very explicit song. I did find & purchase the clean version, & I would recommend clean version of this song.
B0083Z614S|4.0|with its vivid images and Elizabethan voice.<br /><br />My favorite passage that I can remember involves the wind rolling off of the moor, and the sky seeming 'ever so blue'.<br /><br />I still remember when my step-mother read the book to my brother and me when we were children.<br /><br />It was a transformative experience. Secret rooms. Pictures of a world that is almost right.<br /><br />This is one of those books that is certainly a classic for children, and does a good job of expressing that viewpoint with an indomitable confidence, so it's very hard to break the illusion.<br /><br />I gave the book four stars, because it is possible to be more imaginative, or to make a better impression on children.<br /><br />An alternate route would be to go for Lord of the Rings or Newbery Medal books.
B009CGYO0K|2.0|This book does not show up well in Kindle format. Mostly comic book photo-style. Office setting and NOT funny - Very disappointed!

B009TKMOY2|1.0|It's a very poor quality DVD.  And about two hours into the movie, it would no longer play.  It was like it was having digital errors and could not continue.  This copy comes from Thailand.  That means it took for ever to get and wasn't worth anything once it got here.  DON'T BUY THIS DVD.  And I would not buy from this seller again because of it.

B000URWYTS|5.0|I was on a trip to Scottsdale, AZ and had the pleasure of touring Taliesin West.  While there, I had a conversation with a woman who recommended I read this book.  I downloaded it to my kindle on the plane ride home. I couldn't put it down.  This book is a true love story. I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Frank Lloyd Wright.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved the book! I was perfect. It proves to people that even imperfect people can find there Silver Linings.
B0090SI460|5.0|Quality is great, film is fantastic never a disappointment. I can watch this film on every form of media. Pretty awesome!
B0093Q8W0C|4.0|Me and wife found this movie to be more of a comedy than a thriller.  It has all of the signature Hitchcock elements like a cameo from himself, a blonde leading lady, fancy camera work and special effects(for the time).
0786956291|5.0|Great for a starting group of D&D players. Eases players and the DM into D&D comfortably, so no one will get overwhelmed. And the mission inside will keep everyone interested until the DM can get his stuff together. I would recommend going to the Dungeon Masters Kit after this to bring the players from lvl 2-3 and then the monster Vault.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|This reminded me of an old school arcade game,  but much prettier to look at.  It is a lot of fun but it is annoying to control if you do not use the motion control setting because you finger makes it hard to see.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Raiders of the lost arc, Temple of doom and the last crusade are classics which have stood the test of time. Unfortunately not all scenes seem to be touched up to Blu ray clarity. Still 5 stars for the quality of the films and the presentation. (The fourth movie is 1 star AWEFUL! First three 5 stars!)
B002M2T1UO|5.0|I woudln't put it up there with The Wire, but for those who like cop shows, this is a good one. Maybe a great one. It does take a few episodes to really pick up steam, but if you stick with it for those first few episodes, you won't be disappointed.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|Agnetha's latest musical endevour is about a good a sound as can be imagined. A truly wonderful selection of music that suits her superb voice.
B008C20TDG|5.0|We enjoyed the clear explanations of how the body works and how food affects those processes. The humor was fun and kept you reading. My husband and I have been following the plan for a week now. We really aren't supposed to weigh ourselves, but gosh, he was looking different. So we got him in the scale.  Twenty one pounds in a week. I lost 2.2 pounds. It's so unfair. But I did lose and probably the right amount. The truth is, he has a lot more to lose than I. So it's been a good start.

B00AZMFK3K|3.0|My first introduction to the world of Star Trek was not the original series but the second television show, Star Trek: The Next Generation.  I may have seen reruns of the original series before I sat down with my family to watch the pilot episode of TNG, but if so it has been lost to memory.  I do remember watching reruns of TOS after familiarizing myself with TNG and trying to wrap my head around the fact that these two shows were supposed to comprise the same fictional universe.  As I got older, I eventually came to understand the shared philosophy between each iteration of Star Trek: a secular humanist view of the future.  Star Trek exists in a world where the limitless optimism of the 1960s never died.  I continued watching Star Trek shows and movies for years after my first introduction, but eventually I bailed sometime in the middle of Voyager's run (my zeal for Star Trek had its limits).  Still, the first three television shows found a unique way of exploring and commenting on creator Gene Roddenberry's image of the future: TOS presented us with the dangers and surprises of exploration; TNG constructed a lived in image of different worlds attempting to share what sometimes seemed like a small galaxy; and DS9, freed from Roddenberry's creative vision, actually started to question some of the mid-century zeal for the future that characterized the first two shows.<br /><br />I started this review with this brief sketch of my relationship to Star Trek because no one goes into a long running series like this unencumbered.  Even those who have never seen an episode of any of the many series have an image (right or wrong) of what Star Trek stands for.  But you should know that I have an emotional, intellectual, and personal connection to the franchise, and this of course colors how I watched this movie.  When J.J. Abrams first decided to reboot the series, I wasn't sure what to think.  I was cautiously optimistic that he would be able to capture some of the fun of the original, but I in no way expected him to mimic the same pop-philosophy that had always characterized the series and made its way, in abbreviated form, into the movies.  (I can't imagine that Abrams is much of a Herman Melville fan, for instance).  Keeping my expectations in check helped me to really enjoy 2008's Star Trek.  Abrams transformed the movie into a series of sometimes enjoyable, sometimes dumb, and sometimes exhausting action set pieces, but he also managed to capture the relationship between the principal characters surprisingly well.<br /><br />But where Star Trek had the benefit of low expectations, Star Trek into Darkness had the burden of showing where Abrams could take this series and the anticipatory build up of five years, a long time in-between movies.  While it's no unmitigated disaster, Star Trek into Darkness is a mixed bag.  It suffers from the usual problems that plague J.J. Abrams work, like the fact that it works when the gears are moving and the audience has little time to reflect on what's happening, but it starts to flail when things turn serious.<br /><br />Typical of a J.J. Abrams joint, STiD begins in media res, with Kirk and McCoy fleeing a group of natives after stealing a religious artifact.  They hope to lure the island community, a burgeoning society of sentient beings, away from an active volcano long enough so that Spock can set a cold fusion bomb that will deactivate the volcano, allowing the natives to live long enough to enter the Bronze Age.  Kirk soon has to decide whether he should leave Spock to die in the volcano or if he should reveal the Enterprise to the natives and beam Spock out of danger.  Obviously, Kirk decides on the latter, and in doing so he breaks the Prime Directive, a central tenant of Starfleet that says explorers should not interfere with the development of alien civilizations.  Kirk leaves all of this out of his official report, but Spock doesn't, which leads to Kirk's mentor and senior officer, Captain Pike, dressing him down and relieving him of command of the Enterprise.<br /><br />Shortly after Pike has taken command of the Enterprise, a mysterious terrorist played by Benedict Cumberbatch blows up a building used by Starfleet and later attacks a meeting of senior Starfleet officers who have convened to decide how best to tackle this act of terrorism.  In the attack, Pike is killed, sending Kirk into revenge mode.  It's discovered that the terrorist, John Harrison, has fled to the Klingon home world, a warrior race that is on the brink of war with the Federation. So Captain Marcus, played by Robocop himself, Peter Weller, tasks Kirk and the enterprise with tracking Harrison's location and killing him with a long range torpedo.<br /><br />The clear modern analogy is drone strikes, a policy where we often ignore the sovereign space of other nations in order assassinate individuals suspected of terrorism, even if they are also American citizens.  The crew of the Enterprise is naturally uncomfortable with the idea of assassinating a Federation citizen without a trial.  Spock makes his disagreement with the assignment clear and Scotty goes so far as to stay behind rather than to be implicated in the assassination.<br /><br />It's obvious that this plot is attempting to address criticism that Abrams's Star Trek is just dumb fun without any of the original show's notions of philosophy. The use of science fiction to comment on contemporary politics was integral to what made the original series so memorable.  Gene Roddenberry wanted to do more than entertain; he wanted comment on the civil rights movements of the 60s.  In the end, Kirk decides to push aside his desire for revenge and captures Harrison.  I have to commend Abrams and his screenwriters for not only addressing moral quandaries surrounding terrorism, but also for clearly coming down against drone strikes.  It's common for large blockbusters to throw in an allusion to terrorism now and then to give themselves an easy sense of gravitas, but for every film that handles the issue with intelligence (Batman Begins), there are many more films that drop the ball (The Dark Knight Rises).  In fact, I would argue that STiD is better at handling the themes of terrorism, revenge, and justice than more overtly \\"real world\\" movies like Zero Dark Thirty.  And while we will never know for certain, the film's condemnation of assassinating our enemies would have been embraced by Roddenberry himself, who always came off as a bit of 60s radical.<br /><br />It's too bad, then, that the moment Kirk captures the terrorist, Harrison, the movie begins to fall apart. Fair warning: from here on out there are heavy spoilers.  I avoided all spoilers before seeing the film, but I had heard the internet whisperings that Cumberbatch would be playing Kahn, the most notorious Star Trek villain.  Well, he is Kahn.  How a Mexican pretending to be Indian in the original Star Trek universe becomes a Brit in this universe, I'll never know (perhaps they'll explain this discrepancy in the sequel).  Perhaps one of the most potentially exciting aspects of the first Star Trek was that Abrams and company had come up with a way of starting fresh without completely overwriting the long history of the series.  All they had to do was construct an entirely new parallel universe.  But it seems wrong headed for Abram to give himself all of this freedom, to tell the audience that we are now entering a world where anything can happen--we are not bound to continuity; this is my playground now--and then go ahead and retread characters and events from the old universe.  There are so many possibilities in the world of Star Trek. Why give us more of the same?<br /><br />But wait, it gets worse.  Perhaps the most inexplicable moment in the entire film is a restaging of a famous scene from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, but this time the characters are flipped.  Fans of the Star Trek series will almost immediately guess what scene I'm referring to: the death of Spock.  But here it is Kirk who sacrifices his life and restores power to the Enterprise.  At best, this comes across as mistaken fan service, cosplay on the big screen.  Abrams understands, rightly, that the death of Spock still has a strong emotional pull for geekdom.  So he thinks that restaging it will conjure up the same sort of emotional memories.  Instead, the scene plays out as rote.  I felt like I had to endure the death of Kirk in order for the real film to resume.  At its worst, this scene plays out as cynical miscalculation.  Abrams, unable to conjure up something new, tosses out pre-masticated remains for the public.  In my review of Super 8 (a film that has some fine moments), I said that Abrams was like a piano prodigy who can recreate the notes of a piece of music perfectly, but somehow the results are devoid of emotion.  I can think of no finer example of this than STiD's death of Kirk.<br /><br />I don't think Abrams understands what a disservice the death of Kirk did not only to his audience, but also to himself.  Star Trek II is such a taught, well crafted piece of entertainment that to intentionally draw comparisons between it and STiD causes the latter to suffer.  But it also shows how little Abrams understood what made the death of Spock work.  Star Trek II smartly drew on the fact that the characters were getting older for dramatic weight.  Early in the film, McCoy gives Kirk his birthday presents, including a pair of archaic looking spectacles.  Death is becoming real to these characters.  Sure, there's element of survivor's guilt--that these characters have survived trouncing through the galaxy while others haven't.  But it's also the sense that age and death catches up with us all.  This dread hangs over much of the film.  But STiD takes place when Kirk and Spock are just beginning to understand each other.  They don't have the same history, and as young men death is not yet real to them.  In order to understand this, a director has to know not only how to stage action, which Abrams does well, but he must also know how to weave thematic weight into his narrative, which Abrams has yet to learn.<br /><br />But despite my rant, the movie is rather enjoyable until about two-thirds of the way through.  It's not a complete loss.  The greatest boon this new series of movies has going for it are the actors.  Abrams must get credit for assembling a great group of young actors who manage to fit their roles well.  This is especially surprising, because the single greatest aspect of the original Star Trek was the relationship between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.  It was easy to ignore the chintzy 1960s special effects when these three characters and the actors who portrayed them were on the screen.  (I still wish that Karl Urban could get more screen time as McCoy in the new series).  I sincerely hope that this crew has plenty of adventures left, and I think that one day Abrams might even become a great director of blockbuster entertainments.  Until then, I'm happy for someone else to take over for the next installment.

B00BGIC2J2|1.0|This was supposed to be a comedy. The \\"jokes\\" were crude and dull, the plot was seriously lacking, the acting was mediocre, and all the characters did was yell at each other. It just gave me a headache and made me sad that this is what passes as humor.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|This movie is a real &#34;white knuckle&#34; experience.  Highly recommend it for a very enjoyable evening of entertainment and suspense.

0802473156|5.0|Easy read.  Highly recommend this for any dating, soon-to-be-married, married, or in trouble relationship.  Often times, we forget the reasons why we feel in love and find ourselves later in an unhappy relationship because you have never learned what really makes your partner feel loved.  I completely agree with Chapman in his theories of different love languages.  Reading it will make perfect sense and you will immediately start saying \\"this is us\\" as you read the stories in the book. Chapman gives you ideas on how to improve your love and even provides a quiz for you and your spouse in order to determine what language each of you are.<br /><br />Whether you've been in a relationship for 1 year or 30 years, this book will encourage you to improve your relationship.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Quite addictive agree with the tedious tapping grating on you when you upgrade the buildings. Not bad none the less.
1623420148|5.0|I love this book it was very entertaining; Drew was your typical alpha male who thought he could get what ever he wanted, until he met his brown eyed beauty, however the story is told from the males point of view , which by the way is hilarious. I love the  relationship between Drew and his 4 year old niece Mackenzie, when she repeated what Drew said at the table on Thanksgiving, I thought I would die, I laughed so hard tears cam out my eyes. Seriously if want to laugh you must read this book.

B00CL50KDY|2.0|I was excited to watch this movie since I saw the first trailer and check on amazon regularly for the rental version to be available.  Finally it was available and I planned a night in just so I could watch it.  What a let down.  It was a waste of $5 (HD version) and a waste of almost two hours.  Save yourself the money and time.<br /><br />The movie has a novel premise but that's where the novelty ends.  It jumps right into an internal zombie monologue and thereby skips a lot of potential character development and humor.  Ok, fine.  Then we are introduced to the female lead and it's love at first sight.  Again, skipping a lot of potential development and that really defines the movie.  It's just a lot of sudden and discrete changes with no intervening development.<br /><br />As with most Rom-Com movies they is a big \\"couple conflict\\" set up.  And when the male lead finally reveals his big secret.... nothing.  It's accepted and dismissed.<br /><br />Seriously, waste of time and money.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|Fantastic movie showing the trials and travails we transgender people go through in our lives, the fact that it's laced with humor, makes it more accessible to people from all walks of life.  Highly recommended.

B00005JO9J|5.0|I began watching this season and was very interesting. The most amazing things are the special effects in the OR, the medical language and the procedures, everything looked so real, that was awesome. For that reason, I will continue with the Artie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a brilliant game for all the family. You can play and win different characters. If you have kids or enjoy playing games this is perfect. It is basically a more child friendly version of temple run.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I've read all the other books by him, but this one felt trite and rushed and predictable. Plus the ending was anti-climatic. But, still okay overall.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Timeless classics. The heart of adventure is captured in flawless prose.  Magical. Loved it as a child, love it now.
B008OM0EDO|1.0|This movie is stupid and not funny at all. You might find some funny scenes here and there but nothing that you might be expecting. Do not waste your time.
B00CWVFPGO|4.0|Dialogue was sub par. But it was a ton of fun to watch. Lots of great action. Classic Arnold style
B0063GORYU|5.0|When my grandpa first showed me this game it was tricky but when you get the hang of it you WILL never want to stop its so much fun the adds are a little annoying but hey that is my opinion you have youres
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Would recommend reading this book. Great story line. Will read again.next. hope the story continues. Will read more books from this author.
B008LUM25M|5.0|This book is probably one of the best book I have ever read. It keeps you clung on to it the whole way through.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Finally read this and wasn't disappointed. Timely read for those hooked on fantasy/sci fi novels for teens and young adults.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|It's always a cliff hanger ending!! Hopefully it emit be 6 months to year for the next one! Please Sylvia
B004SOR4H6|4.0|relatively simple to use app for Kindle's that links me straight to my twitter . Very much like the app used on my DROID phone , nearly identical in fact .
0156012197|5.0|This is a timeless book, for kids and grown ups. I've got it since I was a kid and this time I bought it to give away as a gift to the people who have been supporting me on my pregnancy, and of course my little girl will have her own too.
B0035JNRXU|5.0|Crew gets their due . The series Next Generation are now on the big screen and are making massive big screen moves , i only wished there were more in the pipe line because they are the best !
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Easy to read and I couldn't put it down. Going to look for another Nicholas Sparks book to read next.
B001XULSG6|5.0|The end of the film series for this crew . The Next Gen gang were my fav's and this short series of big screen movies were good , real good but i sorely miss them and would've loved to see more BIG screen flicks with that crew .
B00992CF6W|4.0|I personally love the game, just not that Apple and android both have gotten the 0.7.0 update AND the bug fix and kindle has not even gotten the 0.7.0 update yet. Be a little faster, Amazon.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|FINALLY !!!  A version we can play against friends and others via the web . Loooooong over due ! Love it and simplicity and enjoy it as much as any other AB game i've played and i've of course played them all  ;)
B00A429YF6|5.0|Saw it back in the eighties ... finally visited Newberry Springs this year, had to buy the DVD to watch it again ... even more fun. The acting is ... is ... well, droll? Just a good story of redemption.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|i hate how the FB apps keep changing and updating only to get worse and worse it seems . Perhaps one day they'll leave well enough alone and let it ride instead of continually finding new ways to frustrate the user and irritate you in every possible way !
B000ID1J0E|4.0|Beautifully acted and faithful to the language and spirit of the book.  However, it's difficult to care about these characters.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|For anyone who has lived with the aftermath of abuse, this book will strike raw nerves that should have been buried long ago.  The author presents Catherine's/Cathy's story alternating between past and present.  We get a clear picture of who Catherine was before she was seduced by evil and her decline into the helpless victim.  As Cathy, we watch her struggle with OCD and PTSD as she learns how to shed the skin of the victim.  Haynes does a great job of painting a picture of a person who has lost nearly all control in her life and her fight to regain control in a healthy way.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|It is definitely a great game to play.  It is addictive like candy crush and I would definitely recommend this game.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I'm not really in to mushy love stories but i have to admit this book I could not put down!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Green gives teenagers their due by letting us see what brilliant creatures they are when adults aren't watching. When you work closely with teens for many years you know how resilient they are, how deep their thoughts really can go, and you learn that they do &#34;notice&#34; more than we can ever imagine. Thanks to Green we can see their &#34;thinking&#34;! But.....what happens to Hazel? Do her parents stay together? Does her mom become a &#34;Patrick&#34;? And what about Issac? I'm booking a flight to Indiana tonight!!
B004UID2LC|3.0|This app is great j can watch videos download music from this app but it always tell me FREEdi YouTube has stopped I go back it works also it freezes and sometimes ruine my kindle. But everything else Is good
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|Talking about taking it to the next level! This is the surprise album of the year. BMTH really have made a creative product that will move them to the  next level, and away for all these mediocre metalcore bands
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Nothing like dragging a series out and destroying its credibility. Day should have ended this series the way it started, FANTASTIC! Characters were brought in that no one cares about, \\"I love you\\" takes up 1/2 of the space in this book and Eva is now a whiny cow who only cares about herself.<br />The ending of the book was like a slap in the face. Haha, you need to buy two more! Thanks for spending $30, now give me more money.<br /><br />I was looking forward to reading this and wrapping up this series. You've destroyed it Sylvia Day
B00BD07SGU|5.0|First let me start by saying that I have been listening to metal for over 15 years and rarely review on here, and this is one of the best albums I have heard in a long time. This is by far the best Amorphis album to date and one of the best of the year. The have stepped up in every area, but especially in the melodies in the choruses. Extremely accurate with just enough power and catchiness to keep bringing you back to the album. In addition, the overall production is top notch....One of the year's best and will go down as the best album Amorphis will release
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Enjoyed it very much.<br />Like the previous seasons the story is great. The Acting  is superb and I can't wait for season 4.
193700788X|2.0|This was awful. Characters did not stay true to themselves, none of the funny irreverent humor of the other novels and strange appearances/disappearances of characters. I really expected better from Harris who usually doesn't disappoint.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|What????? Written for the money only?????? Plot development, to little.  Character development, was there any????  So disappointed. Do I want to wait for the next two books to find out - perhaps I have lost interest.  Don't be a Sylvia Day wanna be.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|It's awesome but I don't extremely love it. I wish there was more to it. But I do like the app.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|If you know Iron Man from the comics and from The Avengers movie, believe me you are going to hate this movie. This is the worst marvel movie ever, this is not Iron Man. :(
B008KP6ENE|3.0|In order to play the game you have to be signed in to amazon app store. Big ding on star rating. Otherwise a fun game!!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Cheap and does the job. I don't need the PhD version, this is quick and easy and so far accurate.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a really fun game to play! I play it all the time and cannot put it down! Although, there are quite a few ads that come and go. :/
B00992CF6W|5.0|you can get 0.7.1 go to Minecraft PE 0.7.1.apk it will take you to dropbox or wait for 0.8.0 jdjdjjdjdjx
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I just started playing it and I'm not sure I really understand all the moves, but I'm having fun doing the basics.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this is a good game and I had a lot of fun sometimes it gets hard but you will get it. wonderful game
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|its a great world war 2 gun simulator. I especially like all the attachments you can put on the guns. great game over al.
B000I9WWCM|5.0|The comedy part of this story is the lead actor and that's the way a romantic comedy should be. The supporting cast is simply superb and although Hugh Grant brings the same character he has played so well any many films, I think it works best for him in this film. Good stuff.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This app is Incredible even though it can be a little challenging<br />I 've rated it 4stars becuase I've seen better but when u can get an app like this for free than it really lucky
B001JIES4Q|5.0|I originally saw this movie and I liked it okay. But then I saw it on television a few years later and thought to myself, this is a great movie, why didn't I like it more the first time I saw it. I think it is one of those movies that you have to see multiple times to really get the nuances of the characters and their stories. Not only that, but it has actors who are now mega-stars. They have tried to steal this formula with some American made movies, and they have failed miserably. This movie is a masterpiece.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|enjoying this game so far. you should give it a try. some what simple. mindless adventure. I would give this a whirl if I were you.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I love the characters in this book. Supernatural?yes. Screwed up? yes again. Very entertaining. Cant wait for the next uh oh moment for the crew.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I love Mrs. Flynn's writing! This book is thrilling and captivating. As a psych major, I really enjoy the intensity of each character.
B000001EL7|5.0|Sounds as if it was brand new and I can listen to it anywhere, while I drive, in my house, anywhere I can play it. Thanks!!!
1451688091|5.0|DKB  does what she does so well, and that is telling the complete story while not getting caught up in page after page of boring details.  The period of time this book covers is not that long in terms of years but it includes multitudes of characters and events which needed to be addressed for the reader to get the full picture regarding the impact that Lincoln had in the unfolding of our nations history.  Her choices of stories, footnotes etc. were perfect in emphasizing the importance of Lincoln and his influence on this particular period of our history. It's a long read but a good one.  I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to know about the inner workings of our country during this particular period.
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|Pee U! This movie doesn't deserve to be counted as part of the Die Hard series. From the start the story was almost moronic with a very lose plot and a bunch of one liners (bad one liners). The term \\"I'm on vacation\\" became redundant. I wouldn't even tell some one to rent this.....
B0091REZMW|3.0|It is a fairly complex game that has many different layers. So far I have discovered very little help in the way of explanation. The graphics and storyline are pretty good but I find myself just stumbling around trying to figure out what to do next.
B00122G00Y|5.0|If you heard the samples and are still debating whether or not to buy this album.  Do it. You won't be disappointed.  I was on the fence and finally just bought it. Now I own all their albums.  Theres not a bad song inthe bunch
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is for you if you like military games. This game is in first player shooting. You could change characters and buy guns or other stuff. You could upgrade too. You could play online or train solo. You could also invite your friends to play with you.If you are in to all these then you should get this game, you don't have to but I think that this is the game for you.
B0091REZMW|5.0|At first the game may seem slow, but you get to the level where your friends can send you food and the.rest is much easier.
B009AMANBA|5.0|This is an excellent movie and one of the best I've seen in a long time. I hope everyone has a chance to watch it.
B009G41CG2|4.0|I like to play games and wanted to try this one. Altho,<br />I like the one that has the option to play this one (Classic) or the (Simple.)<br />Yes I would definitely recommend this item to others.
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|Heart of Obsidian is counsilor Kaleb Krychek's story and I have to admit that it's my favorite along with Judd's and Hawke's. Yes it seems I have a thing for bad guys...<br /><br />This installment is actually more than Kaleb and Sahara's story as there is a real development about the situation with the Pure Psy's claims, the debate about Silence's meaning and involvement of the 3 races. It's a real turning point and I am really excited to read the next books to see where Nalini Singh will lead us!<br /><br />I have always been so impressed by Nalini Singh's writing style, so smart, so moving and this time is definitely not a disappointment. We are learning a lot about Kaleb's childhood, his powers which are totally incredible and what happened to Sahara, whom he has been searching relentlessly for 7 years. Their story is so painfully dark and pure at the same time that it makes your heart throb for them. The identity of the Ghost is revealed as well (heheheee ^^)!!!<br /><br />We also learn that Father Xavier Peres has someone he loves but does not seem to be able to face her for some reasons... I hope that next book will tell us more about him, though there's Vasic and Aden whose stories I am equally looking forward to!
B0063M22QO|2.0|I don't care for this game very well. I like the one with the numbers much better. And also on the Kindle tablet the symbles are too small to see which ones matches. Others may like it just tine.<br />Thank you so much
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I find this book is so beautiful.<br />I love the way he see all religions and the way he talks about them.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game a lot, I play them very often must every night. I know other people would love them too.<br />Thank you so much.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Love the way Gillian Flynn write, this books have a lot of twist and turns.<br />You are never going to guess the final.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Entwined With You is my favorite out of the Crossfire series so far.<br />Gideon is so incredibly romantic and loves Eva with such incredible passion.<br />I did not fully appreciate him until this third book.<br />Their relationship has come full circle.<br />The two have done some growing up and trust seems to be playing a major part in their relationship.<br />The passion between the two is still quite hot and insatiable<br />So very happy we will be getting two more books!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have to say that I'm becoming a Gillian Flynn fan.<br />What a great way of writing she has, she really master thriller.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|This app gives you a nice status bar number and, when you pull down the shade, a button to take you to a detailed battery log. One wish I have is that the percentage in the status bar would include the\\"%\\" sign.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I would not have sought out this novel on my own. One of my students gave it to me, and I'm glad she did. I continually tell my students \\"if you want to be a writer, you have to be a reader.\\" Adam Johnson is clearly a reader. First, the genre of \\"The Orphan Master's Son\\" defies description. It is a wicked mix of so many different types of plots. Second, it's a little bit of \\"Polar Star\\" by Martin Cruz Smith, a little bit of \\"1984\\" by George Orwell, and a lot of \\"Shutter Island\\" by Dennis Lehane. There are even props to Terry Gilliam's \\"Brazil.\\" I don't know how else to describe it. Once you pick it up, it's very difficult to put down until you finish reading it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Google Play Store And App Store (Apple) Have The Updare<br />And Also Theres An Bug When You Quit The Game Your Map Gets Deleted Permanately On 0.7.1
B00515M23M|5.0|My daughter and I were discussing who were the greatest authors and poets of any age....and of course Poe's name came up. There is no generation gap when it comes to great poetry, suspense and terror. Had to download this for my kindle and now the problem is I can't find it because she has it!
B008M7JODC|5.0|I love the that Walter and Peter have a goofy sense of humor like me!<br />This show kept my interest from episode one thru till the last one. LOVE IT
B0098A1TEE|5.0|Was introduced to Miss Emerald through my daughter...how did my kid find my kind of music? Great beats and wakes me up in the morning. Miss Emerald is a wonder.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cute and adorable!<br />It is also definitely worth the 99 cents (or amazon coins)!<br />If you buy it, always remember:<br />FEED WITH CANDY!!!
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|I was enthralled with this book from star to finish.  Having met many Africans in America and Europe, and traveling to Nigeria frequently I am always intrigued by their perspective of us.  This novel gave me a fresh perspective and a new view into their culture. I can't wait to discuss it with NABs and ABs alike.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game I have on my kindle fire. It is so interesting that I want to play it all the time it changes city's and places and with each city there is an item you have to get at least 20 of before the city switches if you don't don't sweat it it doesn't take your points. Add your Facebook to it and try to get a better score than your friends I've been playing this game so long that I'm at the top of my friends list I have 1,325,967 points any it is an awesome game get it it's worth it !!!!!!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Any Solitaire devotee will love Spider, since it becomes increasingly challenging as you add in more decks.<br />Tons of fun!
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should download pocketinvediter to help you out it helps you cause you can get anything available in pocket edition
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As always, Grisham is a great writer.  Very interesting how the &#34;jail house&#34; lawyer uses his trade.  A must read for any Grisham follower.
6304498969|4.0|I'd give a &#34;5&#34;, but this DVD is an import from Asia, based on the opening screen - the usual FBI warnings are nothing but a page of Chinese characters.  The quality however was just fine - a good transfer from the original VHS and the DD5.1 sound is acceptable though not great as it came from a stereo master. I used to own this concert on VHS long before DVDs came out.  It did transfer well, and the 16 x 9 looks fine.
B00821PCJS|4.0|How do you retain civility while fighting for your life against an alien enemy?  This series tries to show our better sides while being as ruthless as they are. Skiittery do's and don'ts. Don't mess with Massachusetts folks!
B008V20PDQ|5.0|this was a cut i always  grooved to back in the day and i use to roller  skate to it.  the groove was tick on the groove and  the melody was direct.  George Benson and Rod Temperton  hit it out of the park with this jam which still brings the goods.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was really looking forward to the final book of Eva's & Gideon's story.  Now I discover there will be 2 more installments - that is unless Sylvia Day decides to string readers along again!  Really fed up with series books.  If I want to watch a  story drug out in a series, I'll watch a soap opera.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this for the first time almost 20 years ago and loved it then.  I recently read it again, because the movie is going to be released and found it impossible to put down.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Excellent graphics and gameplay.  Controls are easy and intuitive.  Abundance of weapon and armor choices.  Varied enemy design and the settings look great.  Very addictive!
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|I enjoyed the movie especially being reminded of some of my favorite video games from childhood including Tapper and Q-bert. I appreciated the interaction between the old and new video game characters and loved Jane Lynch's character. The plot gets a bit convoluted in the middle but has the typical happy Hollywood ending.
B000A0GP18|5.0|Great story, great players, great stuff! Inspiring just like the original! Adam Sandler, Chris Rock and Burt Reynolds are great actors and truly [portray football players.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Delightfully dark, moving, articulate.  We are truly fortunate to have had him with us for so long to share his vision.  Remarkably, he still creates fresh and haunting lyrics and melodies, and there are no words to describe his road weary voice.
B00BESM14U|5.0|It was a great story. Even though the characters in the film had troublesome events that happened to them, I'm glad no one died and the were able to get help
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Interesting plot line. The subject is a little too unbelievable lucky but then there would be no story if he wasn't.
1603427244|4.0|This is exactly what I was looking for.  The pictures and directions are easy to understand.  Just a smaller version of the larger book.
B00380URIO|4.0|A good movie that I had never heard of before. It is hard to find sifi that isn't just another horror movie.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I play it all day long it is so fun they keep adding more cars I love it so much.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This isn't the last of this \\"love story\\" Day is stretching into two more books! This is a filler book with no real advancement for most of the characters. Just day to day boring s***! LOVE Gideon though, no matter what but DON'T BUY this book, there is NO resolution just more boring drama! Forgot how insecure Eva could be. I WILL NOT buy any more of Day's series or her other books, it's such a blatant money grab. DAY, should have done yourself proud and wrapped up this TRILOGY in three NOT five. OMG how much more boring can the plot get??
0743233832|5.0|I enjoyed it.  Very inspiring and thoughtful insights.  Would recommend it to anyone who wants to grow and find more meaning in life.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Best game I have played in forever! Earning points to upgrade has been challenging and fun. Easy to understand how to play and you never know where you will drive next.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I don't want this to come up on my screen I've tried to remove the weather channel , but i'm not able to
B006M4RN3U|4.0|I do like this album, but need to listen to it on shuffle with other music intermingled, as it does get a bit &#34;samey&#34; and for me, they overuse the techno voice enhancer.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Amazing find. Read this as soon as possible. I could not put it down. I can't wait for the continuation.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|My 10 year old and 5 year  old asked for this app after seeing the movie.Great time waster. No complaints.
B00CATSONE|4.0|It is a great overview of a genius who is seldom recognized.<br />I would say that this is a great start to discovering Tesla.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Great game.  Lots of fun.  Kids enjoy playing it in the car or while waiting in restaurants or other places.
B00122VD3S|5.0|I enjoyed this album from the first listen, but even so, all the tracks continued to grow on me even more until I became completely hooked on the whole thing & couldn't stop playing it on almost continuous loop. I don't expect to ever tire of it.<br /><br />There is an amazing and unique quality to Morten's voice that is unlike any other I've heard. The sustained note of that voice can quite literally make my whole chest feel like it's about to split open in an almost painful feeling of wonderfulness. Beautiful, intense tones - high low and in-between - perfect clarity, intonation, articulation, musicality and an incredible ability to convey sensitivity and emotion with just the right level of intensity are what make Morten's voice my favourite of all time.<br /><br />There are harmonies in songs like Los Angeles that make me feel as though every single nerve in my head is lighting up. Brodsky Tune is intense and beautiful and carries a powerful message. I love every single other track on this album, they're all outstandingly good.<br /><br />Please buy this album! You deserve it, and Morten deserves to be heard and recognised as the incredible artist that he is.
B000QCTNIW|5.0|Fascinating.  Can't believe the stories in this book haven't made the news. Could change our lives, especially those with debilating diseases such as ALS, MS . . .
B000XUBFE2|3.0|I was put off at first by the writing style. But soon I was carried away by the story and overlooked the flaws in its telling.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I love these guys, will purchase everything they come out with.  Am waiting for original dvd to go on sale.  I listen to them for hrs everyday, and still don't tire of them.  There is no such thing as too much piano guys!
B003JH8LPW|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Brown writes intriguing novels that hook the reader quickly. A fun run is guaranteed. Brown does it again and again.
B00821OX98|5.0|I don't know why I didn't watch it sooner.  Its fast moving and action is at a good pace. Loving it.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Good continuation of the first book, with a twist at the end to keep you hooked  now onto the third book
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This was a well written story told with truth and depressing details of what life in N.Korea is truly like.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Amazon is always late getting the updates! If you don't update you can't play multiplayer with someone with the most current update. Minecraft 0.7.1 released on June 7th and Amazon has yet to update.  Your best bet is to buy from the Google Play Store is possible.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have read every book in the series and am very sad to see it end. I really enjoyed this book and felt that she ended the series very well.
B00821OX98|5.0|Love the show but every episode takes almost two hours to watch like everything on Amazon due to buffering. Don't have this problem with Netflix or Hulu+.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I'm only giving this a 3 because it's missing some things;i.e., in the computer game, there are more monsters, blocks, and weapons. it's a good game, it just needs to be updated.
B00514HDNW|3.0|I went in thinking this book would be like the movie, it is far from it. It didnt keep my interest for very long but i muddled through just incase. I read it more out of boredom then because i truly enjoyed it.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|After enjoying the Ring trilogy I thought that the hobbit would be just as polished. I was wrong. The adaptation seemed to be lacking, something that the Rings seemed to accomplish without fail.
B004RL9T50|5.0|Love the movie, kids watch it all the time.  Not your normal hero bad buy story, nice twits to it.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada follows Naval Commander Ian Fleming as he attempts to gain control, on behalf of the British Government, of the French Fleet after the German occupation of France during World War Two.<br /><br />This was an intriguing look into the lesser known side of Ian Fleming. A well researched and brilliantly written novelisation of Ian Fleming's experiences during the early part of World War Two. Filled with scenarios that feel familiar, as Ian Fleming had used his own experiences, such as those featured in this book, as inspiration for his world famous Bond novels. The Ian Fleming files are filled with detailed descriptions and fast paced action. The author's attention to detail in regards to setting the scenes and describing equipment and authentic WW2 attire really helps to place you into the historic era in which this book is set. I hope to read more from this author and follow Ian Fleming further into his wartime experiences.
B00992CF6W|5.0|On Amazon app store get PocketInvEditor<br /><br />It's works with minecraft<br /><br />If you have an Apple product get Pocket Tool. I love both of them
B0088X7YMS|5.0|Bought this dvd to complete the series as a present for my son.  Came quickly, well packaged, and in great condition - all for a good price ! CAN'T BEAT THAT !
193700788X|1.0|Thank you reviewers!<br /><br />I've enjoyed reading your reviews far more than I enjoyed the book.<br /><br />And Charlaine Harris,  shame on you for ending this series in such a crappy way.
6305308659|5.0|i absolutely love this movie and have been looking everywhere for it. soooo glad i was able to get it here because i got it for a great price.
0793518326|4.0|I have been learning, and performing, songs by the Beatles since I was 14 years old (and that was in 1964). In those days I always tried to learn the pieces note perfect. In later years I began doing interpretations or arrangements of these songs, but when someone asks me to play a song by the Beatles, I usually grab \\"Norwegian Wood,\\" or \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away,\\" because I know people want to hear these songs like the originals.<br /><br />Recently, a group of high school students asked me if they could learn, and perform, the entire Abbey Road album. So I bought a copy of these scores to help me along.<br /><br />These scores were an invaluable tool, but I still had to do some extra work to communicate what was in them to these students.<br /><br />Here are a few things that come to mind:<br /><br />1. These songs are not in album order, and that includes the \\"medley\\" songs on Abbey Road. What a pain, especially when the transitions are not accurately notated.<br /><br />2. Sometimes the chord name is not accurate, so I had to tweak a few of these.<br /><br />3. I did not always agree with the notation or tab on the guitar solos. In one song, they attribute the solo to two guitars, when it is clearly one on the recording.<br /><br />4. The vocals are written an octave higher than the actual range. This is fine for people who can read treble clef, but I had to renotate some of the vocals so that the singers could see their parts more accurately.<br /><br />I'm not saying these things as a complaint, but as a way of saying this is an excellent guide to the work of the Beatles, but it's not perfect, and will still require your attention. The book has been an invaluable tool, and I plan to use it more in the future.
0811879542|5.0|This book is fun to read yourself and you will want to share it with others. I bought 4 and gave copies away to family.
0385349947|5.0|I was an invited panelist (the only man on the panel) that reviewed this book and talked about what it really means for women and their lives and careers.  The panel was sponsored by the local chapter of Women in Medicine and Science (WIMS).  I felt a little out of my comfort zone, as the audience was large and essentially only women.  Many learned lessons from this book, but MY take home message is that both women and men need to Lean In at times and Lean Out at others, and we need to support and facilitate others so that this can happen.
B005HSL626|5.0|I have downloaded this app about a month ago, and it is entertaining.  My 12 and 14 year old children love it.  It is hard to keep them off of my kindle.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I recommend this app. This gives hours of fun and challenging. You will be impressed!  It's very interactive. It'll keep you guessing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun puzzle game that gets more challenging as it goes on.  In the beginning, it is simple  Fill all the squares by connecting the colored dots to the corresponding dot.  No biggie.  As you get deeper into the game, it is really a thought game.  Fun and entertaining and challenging all together.  My kids like this when we are on long road trips, short road trips too.  It is fun.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|There is something really great about knowing what these characters are about already. Then mashing them to 'work' together, and every food scene is cringefest because - is there or isn't there something in the food?
B003DNN0L2|5.0|I feel like this film did not receive as much attention like it should have when it originally came out, but I'm happy to see that overall it has received favorable reviews now. The script is well written and clever and there are a number of funny running gags throughout. The animation is wonderfully smooth and delightful to watch.<br /><br />I purchased the BluRay, DVD, Digital Copy version which is a great bargain considering the Digital Copy is an actual disc and not a code that expired like you run into with some Digital Copies. I highly recommend this film as it has plenty of humor for younger viewers as well as a compelling story for older audiences that can get all the film's subtleties.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this book almost non-stop. Like many movies, the story line is not followed, once again. I am glad I read the book before seeing the movie. I felt like I was getting to know the character on a personal level. Each one was so well developed, including the obnoxious father.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|One more for the money?  Come on Ms. Day, you are losing fans; what a cheap shot.  I don't really care about Eva and Gideon anymore.  You did that.  For shame, I liked them at one time...
B0052RDHTM|4.0|It is entertaining. Mixes romance, history, stories, places in a way that makes it very interesting and not boring at all.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|As I have  read every novel by Mr. DeMille,  this one did disappoint.  The plot was too predictable  and the characters  were  thinly developed.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Anyone looking for a great show, This is it !! I recommend to start here at Season 1. If you don't you will be confused !
B009LDMJBU|5.0|Great music, great singer !  I always loved Italian music and Eros is one of my favorites. Hope to get some more CDs.
B000Y1H7VA|5.0|good music. like the new perspective with some videos included in the album. been a sp fan ever since early 90's
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|All the great old Fogerty songs redone with a fresh new sound --- even if you prefer the old way still a great listen
B00AK57N00|1.0|This game is super boring I use test drive and let me tell you it was the worst time of my life. This is what you do you get a rope and you jump on different platforms. I had to download the app to get it . WASTE OF SPACE!!!!!! If you ask me one star is took much way to much.
B003O86FMW|5.0|this is a page turner.  i can't wait to finish #3, and see #2 in the theaters.  it's a wonderful trilogy.
0345315227|3.0|This book is pretty good, but I was somewhat unsatisfied with the conclusion of the legendary Space Odyssey series. It's by far the worst book of the series, but it's okay.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Not as quick a read as the previous books.<br />You absolutely would be lost if you had not read the first four books. I am enjoying it, but that is mostly because it continues the story,
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Finally I can listen to my favorite talk shows and my varied music tastes AND work on a project or read my new book with just my kindle. So easy to figure out
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love Gideon and Eva!!!! I can't wait to see where their journey goes next! SYLVIA DAY you rock! :)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I could tell you how much I loved this book, how I covered my mouth and shouted at just the right moments or how much it hurt when Augustus died. However, I can't do justice to the feelings I felt. All I can tell you is that being someone who reads a few books a week when left alone long enough, that this is the best book I have ever read, invoking emotion and thought just like a good book should.<br /><br />Read it. You'll love it.<br /><br />\\"It's a good life, Hazel Grace.\\"
B009X1398C|5.0|We got interested in this series late.  But we love having the complete first five to catch up with now.
B0015AARJI|2.0|the controllers don't hold a charge they have to be plug in to work and the did not come with a charging cord
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|The book itself is great as usual but the end was disappointing. Really leaves you hanging. All I could say was &#34;you've got to be joking!&#34;
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Plot is similar to others he has written: Reacher gets into a town where strange things are happening, becomes friendly with a woman, there is a strange barn in the outskirts, etc,.etc. I think Mr. Child needs to vary his plots more
B009IJJ5B4|1.0|It would have been better if the back ground music wasn't so loud that I couldn't hear conversations in the show<br /><br />I wont my money back
B005LAII3A|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. everything was spot on to make it 2 hours of brainless action-fun.<br />Colin Farrel is always a good action hero. Jessica Biel actual was more believable than usual (dont usually like her). Finally, Kate Beckinsale is fantastic, beautiful, full of energy, believable. Seeing her in this and having loved most of her action rolls absolutely no one can or should play Wonder Woman than Kate Beckinsale.<br /><br />Is it a dream.<br />is it real.<br />Who cares.<br />Its a fantastic movie that will entertain you for the full time its on.<br />that is everything a film should ever need to be.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|A lot of songs that I didn't know were on the CD that I liked. Kids and I enjoy jamming to this in the car.
B00992CF6W|5.0|my mobile phone has the 0.7.1 update but amazon has yet to get it I have rated the app with a five because I have the updated version on my phone and if is SPECTACULAR please get the update for amazon! thank you
B0085G0DH6|4.0|Belonging is one of my favorite albums (I've only listened to it a few thousand times over the years),  so this was a real treat.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Jeffery Archer is a buperb writer.  I have loved every one of his books, just wish I didn't have to wait until next April for the next one in the Clifton Cronicles.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Very cute game. I don't know if it's just me or not, but some of the games you play while in this game is difficult to understand how to play. Overall cute game for all ages.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This seems to be such an easy game until you get into the higher levels. My young grandson likes it because of the colors he doesn't realize he is learning as he plays. It takes a lot of thought and being able to find odd patterns to solve these puzzles. My husband will even play this one and he doesn't like any computer games. It think it reminds him of designing circuit boards.
B0041KXOVC|1.0|I was not satisfied at all. The DVD would not in USA. I would not recommend it to anyone in USA
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|If you want a story about a middle school, ordinary kid the right book is diary of  Wimpy kid third wheel.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|I love this movie. It showed up when expected in good shape no damage. I would recommend this to anyone
B008RLTUUA|5.0|I practiced medicine for the last 52 years.......Dr. Goldacre explained plainly, tersely  and gallantly what is going on.<br />I would recommend this book to all MDs, PhDs, Patient organizations, nurses ,reps, and so on
B009R659L8|5.0|this book was great, it kept you guessing until the end. I really enjoyed  reading it and I have alwaysl loved the author.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|as the title said there's not much to say its a good movie same way the director made it almost 30 years ago
B005KR6NS6|5.0|The dancing is fantastic, the story very clever, and theres no big Hollywood  overkill.<br />children could watch it too.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed it
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Amazing game. It is so much fun I can not stop playing it! I could play it all day long.
B008QPCCQQ|4.0|I really would give this 4 7/8 stars.  I love having all the books in one place at such a great price.  The only problem I see with it, is that there are quite a number of typos in it, which is not too big a deal, but a little better editing would help.
1469220725|2.0|OMG! I cannot believe Sylvia wrote this installment. It was PLOTLESS!!! Yes, I like the romance, but it seemed as though the sex took over the book instead of tying up some of the loose ends. I hated the ending. So, disappointed over the this installment. Sylvia you have got to come better!! Please, don't wait another six months to finish this series. Complete the story in book 4 for the fans pulling for a Gideon and Eva happily ever after TOGETHER ending.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I'm speechless... this game is the best the missions are great they give so much money and you can rob a freaking bank
B006CHML4I|3.0|the watch has to be re-set if it sits for more then 1 day. the blue dye on the canvass wrist band comes off when wet and gets on other material, such as a towel.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|It a lot of fun for my kid and I love it to now I can't tell a lie about that. :) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!$$$$$$$$??????$$$$$$$$$$$!!!!!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game to play.  I like this game because my four-year-old can even play and enjoy this game.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|this is okay for 45 year old but it's way too slow for anything over that. there for I didn't need it right away because I found no pleasure in this game.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Great game to play in your spare time.  Would like to see this game on Xbox or Wii someday soon
1781162646|5.0|Looking for a good summer read or two? From the New York Times list of sixteen worthy candidates (June 7, 2013), I chose two. Glen Orbik's pulp fiction cover of an amusement park Hollywood Girl with her Speed Graphic drew me to Stephen King's new novel, \\"Joyland.\\" Janet Maslin's praise for Rebecca Lee's first collection of short stories helped me settle on \\"Bobcat\\" as my other choice.  Here's my take on \\"Joyland.\\"<br /><br />Nothing here not to like. Lincoln Park in North Dartmouth, Massachusetts,the amusement park that set the standard for me a generation or so before the action in \\"Joyland\\" takes place exits today only in photographs and in the memories that snap into focus every time I drive by the site. Not a bad way to approach \\"Joyland.\\" The narrator, Devin Jones, speaks as of the present about his experiences as a twenty-one year old \\"Happy Helper\\" at \\"Joyland,\\" in Heaven's Bay on the North Carolina Coast back in 1973. My research could track down neither the park nor the place for King's fictional analogs. One possibility, Lumina Park (1905 to 1975) in Wrightsville Beach, N.C. A better guess might well be Palace Playland in Old Orchard Beach, Maine, which is much closer to King's present stomping grounds. Because Stephen King is not your run of the mine Hard Crime Case series author, the book was released in two very limited hardback editions each with a marvelous artist's conception of Joyland by Susan Hunt Yule. Track it down on Google by checking out \\"Joyland\\" on the Hard Case Crime web site.<br /><br />To work at Joyland, the Happy Helpers had to learn the language, the lingua franca of the amusement business, and you will learn right along with them. For one thing, it was a firing offense to refer to the customers as \\"rubes\\"; they were \\"conies. When they hear it they think Coney Island. We know better. They're rabbits . . . hopping from ride to ride and shy to shy [attraction] instead of from hole to hole.\\" The narrator and two close friends, Tom Kennedy, a Happy Helper,  and Erin Cook, hired as a Hollywood Girl (aka \\"Merry Chicks\\") photographer, carry the action. At work Erin wore a short  green dress  and used a Speed Graphic  like the one pictured on the book's cover (see illustration). The three worked together on Team Beagle  and often spent their free time together.<br /><br />It was a Hollywood Girl's  enterprising work with her Speed Graphic, snapping pictures of couples and families at the park attractions,  the Carolina Spin, the shooting gallery and the Horrow House, that get the who-done-it plot moving. Her work the day of the crime turned up several photos of the attractive young woman murdered, presumably by her  boyfriend, during a trip through the Horror House. The boyfriend's face is sufficiently concealed by his cap and sun glasses to prevent easy identification, but the photos are not without clues. It's not long before Erin and Devin are on the case. This being a King novel, the paranormal comes into play. There is a delicious moment, too,  when Devin's status as a virgin comes totally undone. So, if this new King novel is nothing more or less than a good beach read in the best pulp fiction tradition it's entitled to five stars on that ground alone.<br /><br />End note. Fairgrounds,  Caribou, Maine.  Summer of 1950.  My date and I went from shy to shy at the  touring carnival. At one, I blew my ward on game of chance that I became convinced was stacked against me. So, pleading my minority and a state law against gambling, argued for my money back and settled for half. King, on p. 66 of \\"Joyland\\" makes clear that there is word for that: \\"A cony who loses at some shy and wants his mooch back is a mooch-hammer.\\" Now I know.
B0026QC0TA|4.0|Good storyline told by veteran actors.  Very enjoyable and entertaining.  Would recommend.  Included at no charge with Prime membership.  Worth the time!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Nothing can increase the enjoyment of a Hawaiian vacation like having an excellent book to take with you.  This was that book.  Thank you Mr. Howey for a thoroughly engrossing tale which was indeed hard to put down.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Very good show along the lines of Downton Abbey but not quite as good as that show. First season was very short though.
B005PK57NU|5.0|so typical of politics.<br />almost as sleasy as the real thing.<br />Politics corrupts.<br />Read the newspapers.<br />Just like real life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because it is addictive and really fun. I like the characters that are used in this game because they are all different and personalized.
B007Z58RLC|4.0|Although this was written, in literary terms, eons ago, it remains quite readable and is probably the best single introduction to Buddhism there is in the literary world. Start here and you'll be well on your way to understanding Buddhism.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|so fun play it everyday and once you start playing u cant stop it isn't hard its easy and great game
B000HKYBXA|5.0|Hamlet deals with many important human themes: death, love, lust, loyalty, power, God, the afterlife, the effect of the universities' philosophy, fathers and sons, fathers and daughters, mothers and sons, the art of acting, the folly of revenge, the wheel of fate, and many others. This particular screen adaptation is certainly one of the most beautiful films ever made. Branagh is brilliant and his wonderful supporting cast sparkles. Special effects are tremendous in portraying the power of the spirit world and the appearance of Hamlet's father's ghost. Billy Crystal gives a hilarious rendition of the grave-digger and Charleston Heston delivers a rich and powerfully skilled performance as the leader of the players in Shakespeare's play within a play, in which he uses Hamlet to give acting lessons. The richness and realism of the set, the well spoken and blocked lines make the meaning pour forth. In every sense the movie is a triumph for &#34;the bard,&#34; hence my decision to buy a copy for myself so that I will have it handy to view again at a whim and use it to tutor my students. Kate Winslet is a winsomely beautiful and haunting Ophelia. I highly recommend this Hamlet for all who wish a clear understanding of the play and a spectacle to behold and experience.
B00932A4XE|4.0|I watched this movie 10 days postpartum and just about laughed until I cried!  Recommended that my hubby watch it too :)
B00AK57N00|5.0|its a really great game to pass the time if your on a road trip or mabye stuck in the office Mr.AahH is pretty fun :D
B00932A4XE|2.0|Thought this would be a good movie looking at  the cast, but found it to be slow moving, so turned it off about half way through..
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|i love it. I want the next stage of the game.  it was kind of scared at times. want the next game. hope its just like this one
B00005YW4H|5.0|My first CD of Norah Jones, it won't be my last. The recording sounded very good. I'm surprised at the soundstage, it was immense!  Perhaps my speaker tweaking efforts finally paid off! Can't say I love all the songs, but well worth the price. Curious about the HD Tracks version if the CD is this good, can the HD version be that much better?<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Freshmen going through the ten adjustment cycle finds friends with some high school seniors dealing with adjustments of their own.  I think it is a well crafted slice of the American high school experience for many of us from the 1970s time frame.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|It starts with this book not being released until six months after it was to be available. I pre-ordered because I thought I would be able to read this TRILOGY in a few months. There was no explanation for the delay.<br /><br />Finally, I read the book. Not a trilogy after all. This whole book was a poor attempt to stretch out the story so Sylvia Day could get two more books out of it.<br />The story lost it's edge becoming repetitive, boring and uneventful. This is a huge disappointment. Gideon and Eva's story should have ended with this book and with some class.<br /><br />I don't respect an author who has no respect for her readers. I won't be buying anymore of her books.
B00CT2P6VA|4.0|Why 4 and not 5 stars? Only because there doesn't seem to be enough 'help'. Those hidden levels are sometimes very difficult to find and there isn't always a hint or clue as to how to find it. Other than that... great game!
193700788X|5.0|I love all of Charlene Harris book series but especially Sookie Stackhouse. Dead Ever After did not disappoint and I can't wait for the next one.
B003QP4BJM|5.0|The book is exactly about what its title says. The reader will finish it completely convinced that our current world is much better than the past. The evidences, once organized as in the book, are too strong and too obvious. A must read.
B003SPCYP8|5.0|Funny, Sad, Romantic awesome story! Watched it with my classmates during a discussion about aspergers syndrome and everyone absolutely loved it!
B0000025ZF|2.0|I read in the Pink Floyd bio that when deciding their next project, the members of Pink Floyd were presented by Roger Waters demos for 'The Wall' and demos for 'The Pros and Cons..\\" Apparently Pink Floyd voted hands down for 'The Wall.' Good choice. Being the Pink Floyd fan that I am,  I'll give Pros and Cons another 20 listens. Maybe I'll grow to like it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I read The Lincoln Lawyer about a year ago only because it was coming out as a movie. The moment I opened it, instant vacuum. I had my nose in it until the last page. Since it's so rare to find an author that pulls you in from the first page to the last, I put his whole collection on my Kindle and blazed through it. Just finished the last one, and, truth be told, was a bit sad on turning the last page. I already miss Harry Bosch!
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved the books -- wondered how the story could be told on screen.  Was not disappointed.  Never once got bored watching, and I am an OLD person!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. Everything about this game is splendid mystery boxes,coins,keys,players,obstacle course playing this game is NOT a waste of your time!!!!!!!!!!
B006TF6WAM|5.0|The most enjoyable book I have read in years.  I was gripped early on by the apparent simplicity of the story and of Harold's character.  The second half of the book loses the powerful simplicity of the first half but gains in other ways.  A hugely rewarding book in my opinion.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|This game doesn't make any sense. All you do is watch your horse run around. The graphics are great and awesome and it never freezes pauses buffers. This app os just ok.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is a lot of fun! I play it more than any other game. I think there should be more ways and easier ways for getting the jewels though... or make the armors a little cheaper.
B00992CF6W|3.0|It's a really fun and awesome game for all ages, but they need to update or already. 2 days ago Johan berhansson (the person that made the game) said If came out already for android.<br />But if hasn't came yet :(
0743289684|4.0|An honest and haunting memoir, unashamed to be itself and unbeholden to the fashionable strain of political correctness that so often stifles critical thinking among intellectuals today. Some find that aspect of the book problematic; I found it courageous, even refreshing at times. Despite her harrowing life story, Ali shows an impressive amount of restraint when discussing those who once so heinously persecuted her. She's generous with her sympathy but refuses to compromise the truth - all with the goal of helping the oppressed woman escape a life of violence and abuse, even though doing so has nearly cost her her own life. Although we would disagree on a few issues, I found my respect for Ayaan Hirsi Ali increasing with each page I turned, and I'm glad I finally made my way to this unpretentious and affecting memoir.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This games awesome is the best game I have on my kindle I love it so much and I will never delete it
B000FC1MCS|3.0|** spoiler alert **<br /><br />Someone on the back of my book compared this novel to The Catcher in the Rye. I'm having a hard time seeing how that's an apt comparison, besides the obvious fact that both novels are narrated by teenage boys. People are always trying to compare things to The Catcher in the Rye. In my eyes, that book stands alone.<br /><br />But, in terms of my subjective experience as the reader, these two books have one more thing in common: they both made me really sad. The Catcher in the Rye is a far more masterful book in my opinion - and therefore more compelling. But there were poignant moments in this one, too.<br /><br />Things that made me sad in this book:<br /><br />1) I did not enjoy reading about the murder of Wellington. I'm one of those irrational people who can stand to watch a movie in which hundreds of mobsters shoot at each other all day but who then bursts into tears when someone steps on a dog's paw. I can't bear to read about or see the suffering of animals - especially dogs. I did not enjoy the recurring image of a poodle with a pitchfork sticking out of its side. I don't like rats all that much, but it also made me sad when Toby died.<br /><br />2) It made me sad that Christopher's favorite dream is one in which he wakes up in a post-apocalyptic world as one of the few survivors of a deadly virus.<br /><br />3) It made me sad that Christopher's parents did not get back together in the end. Yes, I know, I remember what Mrs. Doubtfire says in response to the little girl's letter at the end of that movie, but I was still hoping to see the parents reunite.<br /><br />4) The dad made me sad from beginning to end.<br /><br />5) I'm still trying to figure this one out: I felt sad when Christopher got a puppy at the end of the book. Maybe because I worried that the dad would strike again???<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad I read this book. I found some parts to be tedious, but the execution is clever. There are lighthearted and funny parts, but be prepared to get sad.s, but be prepared to get sad.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|There isn't anything wrong with this dictionary, but it's a little out of date and present have a lot of words that are common
B00064WSNW|3.0|I'm a little surprised at the almost exclusively glowing reviews for this album on Amazon. It's a good album, but to me it doesn't stand with King Crimson's best work. Some argue that the band had to change and progress. Fair enough, but this seems like a few steps *back* from their earlier work to me.<br /><br />There are even a few parts that even annoy me (all of \\"Elephant Talk\\" for instance), but most of the songs are good. This is merely a decent album, in my view.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 10 year old son recommended that I buy Subway Surfers. Very fun. Very high energy. My kids love the different characters and love to challenge each other.
B002RXZF6C|4.0|This black and white 1931 movie was the start of the frankenstein movie series. It a &#34;must have&#34; for collectors. Best entertainment ever.
B00116FT6M|5.0|This is my new favorite movie! Great casting and storyline... I love the Turnblad family's casting. It overall has a wonderful message and makes some really good role models. Zac Efron is amazing as Link!
0345529057|5.0|This is a great book.  I couldn't put it down.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy.
0316010669|5.0|I made the mistake of reading Predictably Irrational at the same time as I was reading Blink. This is a problem because although both books are great, they advance virtual opposite concepts and both have solid research and sociological/statistical evidence to support their conclusions.<br />I often make Blink decisions - like the man I married, but then sometimes I spend extensive time researching. According to Blink, that extensive research may result in the wrong decision, but according to predictably irrational, people often compare apples with apples, or so we think and come out with a conclusion that isn't logical.<br />For example, we purchased 3 properties - 2 rentals and one residence. They are each in a distinct economic sector of the US. One of the rentals was the price of a car, the other, a small down home, and the third in a major metropolitan region. In each case, we pretty much matched the median price for that economic region, based on research about the local housing market, crime trends, flood zones, etc. However predictably irrational says that people tend to pay the same amount for each home regardless of what geographic region it is in and what the local market forces are. So, apparently, we dodged the bullet there, by doing extensive research.<br />However, Malcolm contends that people need to listen to their gut and feel a decision. I don't know that he would argue that this is the only way to make a decision, so much as that we shouldn't let extensive research and scientific study overwhelm or silence our own intuitive sense of what we know.<br />So, the challenge becomes how to blend the two remarkable and contradictory books into a guideline for effective decision making. Regardless of where you come out, I do recommend reading them both in a relatively short time frame, so you can compare the concepts side by side. Fascinating and intriguing ideas in both, doubly so when read together.

0061353248|5.0|I made the mistake of reading Predictably Irrational at the same time as I was reading Blink. This is a problem because although both books are great, they advance virtual opposite concepts and both have solid research and sociological/statistical evidence to support their conclusions.<br />I often make Blink decisions - like the man I married, but then sometimes I spend extensive time researching. According to Blink, that extensive research may result in the wrong decision, but according to predictably irrational, people often compare apples with apples, or so we think and come out with a conclusion that isn't logical.<br />For example, we purchased 3 properties - 2 rentals and one residence. They are each in a distinct economic sector of the US. One of the rentals was the price of a car, the other, a small down home, and the third in a major metropolitan region. In each case, we pretty much matched the median price for that economic region, based on research about the local housing market, crime trends, flood zones, etc. However predictably irrational says that people tend to pay the same amount for each home regardless of what geographic region it is in and what the local market forces are. So, apparently, we dodged the bullet there, by doing extensive research.<br />However, Malcolm contends that people need to listen to their gut and feel a decision. I don't know that he would argue that this is the only way to make a decision, so much as that we shouldn't let extensive research and scientific study overwhelm or silence our own intuitive sense of what we know.<br />So, the challenge becomes how to blend the two remarkable and contradictory books into a guideline for effective decision making.

B00C2VIA52|5.0|I love this game. It is a virtual card game that looks stupid at first but is really fun. You can play for hours on the campaign, multiplayer, or just pillaging other people for coins. You don't have to buy stuff with real money, but if you do, you get really good cards.

B002GZQYMK|5.0|Having grown up in the 60's and 70's, I seen everyone from the Who to Jefferson Airplane and Big Brother. While I would call myself a rocker and MUSE does rock, their blends of other genres from symphonic to electronic makes Bellamy and crew a band I wish I discovered 20 yrs. ago. Just returned from seeing them live in Montreal and they are a great live band as well as accomplished studio musicians.

B007QPFGJW|5.0|It is difficult to write a review without touching on the plot which has surprises at every turn. Harry has greater realization of the complexity of his personality but remains a flawed character.  The plot intertwines his personal life with his gift of solving complex crimes. The result is an excellent tale of love, hate, deceit and despair.
1575666286|5.0|This book really changed my life! I was going through a lung illness and other symptoms and no one could figure out what was wrong, but since I've been on the Gerson diet, my symptoms are diminishing and I can breathe regular again!<br />The Power in Living foods are amazing! Doctors and researchers always talk about Living foods and say they \\"could\\"prevent cancer or they could prevent this and that... But what they won't say is if they can prevent these things...can't they cure them also. I am so empowered reading this and I am exited for whats to come in my Life! Perfect health! Now, let me go juice some carrots and apples! :)
B009GED3HS|5.0|My husband and I have been following this show for years now and season eight did not disappoint. I just love these charaters. The season finale will keep us hanging all summer! Can't wait for the ninth season to start but I will be sad when it ends!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Found this to be an interesting read.  A guilty pleasure read.  I really enjoyed how this was written, more of first person interviews that start us from the beginning of the Zombie war and takes us to the end of the Zombie war.  This book is not for all.  I would recommend to those that enjoy zombie movies or tv shows or those that like this kind of genere.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|No problem so far, good replacement for OEM paste. Easily applied, no mess. Rather more than enough, I've used it for 2 laptops and still have extra.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I like how tough and lightweight the case is, it's very protective of the Kindle Fire. That's the reason for the four stars. The easel of the cover really is difficult to use, keeps slipping and I don't like the color black but that's the only color it comes in.
B00004XQ83|3.0|I was prepared to NOT like this at all but it's okay. I just cannot get my brain wrapped around a couple of the actors' roles as they did not fit -- for me.
B002Q9MZF6|5.0|I loved this cinematic version of &#34;La Boheme&#34; !! Also, the great performances of Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazón. The best version I've ever seen of this romantic opera,
B0011EVSGE|5.0|Our family loves this film. It is a classic, family friendly movie that has good acting, catchy songs and fun scenes.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|story was weak mostly violence and shoot-em up. some of the story was out of place and did not make some sense. But I like Bruce Willis but also the movie before this was better and the story was good. Also being in Chernobyl for so long without a hazard suit it made it look like they were Supermen and didn't get cancer or sucome to the radiation. And when they were in the water that was ridiculous and unbelievable.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I cant stop playing this game. I mean who wouldn't want their own Iron Man suit to play with? I would recommend to anyone who likes games and not simple apps.
B008Q0D9DG|4.0|Sports fan's and comedy fan's if you love to laugh out loud then you are going to enjoy the movie!!
B0093ST02E|3.0|Im sure this story has a lot of hidden meanings, but I didn't really get it. To me it kind of made divorce ok for any situation.
B007NZQU72|4.0|I found this book valuable for understanding that I am hard wired as a sensitive person and that it is not a character flaw.  For much of my life, I thought there was something wrong with me, but now I have more peace around my temperament and understand how to care for myself to feel more comfortable in our culture, which does not value these temperamental traits.
B00992CF6W|5.0|OMG I absolutely love minecraft so I bought minecraft on my computer but it was so laggy that I couldn't play it then when I found out that it came out on the kindle fire I bought it instantly. it works amazing but I wish they would have more updates like with buckets.

B004132HZS|5.0|One of the best shows on tv. Benedict Cumberbatch is the best Sherlock I've ever had the pleasure of watching. (And one of the best looking men I have ever seen, ha ha). Martin Freeman is the perfect Watson to Ben's Sherlock. He's a sweet, thoughtful every man who brings a sadness and caring to Sherlocks craziness.<br /><br />  The first episode perfectly sets the tone for the rest of the series. It's funny, exciting and full of surprises. Each season has 3 episodes and each episode is about an hour and a half. Lots of good extras and the re-watch value is spectacular. I've watched each season like 3 times and I still find/see things I never noticed before.<br /><br />  Watch this show now!!
1607066017|5.0|One of the most amazing comic series I have read in years! If you get a chance you absolutely MUST read this.
1849904251|5.0|Sherlock quickly has become my favorite show and this book is a great companion to the series. It digs deeper into the series and provides some interesting insight into both the classic Sherlock and the show. You also get some interesting facts about the actors and the process for making the show.<br /><br />  Just a side note: if you're a &#34;Cumberb*tch&#34; you will love this book too. Lots of great pics and you learn a ton about Ben. Definitely worth it.<br /><br />  Also shipping was super quick. The estimate was several weeks but I got it in about 5 days.
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|Great cast, funny one-liners, and lots of pretty people. Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters is an action-packed flick that will keep you entertained the entire time.  Sure it won't win any Oscars any time soon but if you're looking to be pulled into a fantasy world for two hours, this movie is it.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|What's there to say that hasn't been said already? Hands down this is one of the best made shows on tv. Benedict Cumberbatch is the best Sherlock I've ever seen. Martin Freeman is an amazing Watson and the perfect level-headed companion.<br /><br />  Each season as 3 episodes and each episode is about an hour and a half. This season is a little more serious the the first but serious suits this series just fine. Get ready to have a heart-attack on the last episode.<br /><br />  All in all, awesome acting, awesome series, awesome awesome. Buy it NOW!
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|My kids loved  the movie, I sat and watched it with them and enjoyed it, it had funny scenes the only issue is the effects aren't so great.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I usually only read mysteries but this book was recommended by Gillian Flynn (author of Gone Girl) so I decided to give it a try.  It was interesting because it helped me understand some aspects of myself as well as people in my life.  I was surprised when the book came to an end around the 80% progress mark on my Kindle then pages of notes and citations followed.  It's a book that I recommend and feel it will be valuable to me moving forward.

B000AP04L0|5.0|I first saw this when I worked for a broadband provider. More true to life then one would expect. I've met all the characters portrayed in this film.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Such well developed characters with interesting intersecting storylines. The story is written in such a thoughtful and considered way and with an understanding of human nature and people's need for mercy and not judgement. It reads like a long poem.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I normally enjoy most of John Gresham's books. I know there cannot be a happy ending to all true to life type of books. Delving into a very interesting and believable young boy is tops for reading enjoyment.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The reason I rated wonder a five star book is because it was so detailed I think that R. J. Palacio did a fantastic job writing this book
B0085YOD1A|1.0|This app does nothing by itself, other than show a pretty icon. I was expecting some sort of battery management, or the ability to make some programs be low priority, given that this was a paid app. It was just a waste of time. Thankfully, I tested it out from the free app of the day and did not have to waste any money on this useless garbage.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|How can you not like this movie--one of the best.  I will never tire of seeing Grace Kelly on screen
B000H305U0|5.0|This CD was worth every dime that was paid for it. CD was smooth and clean. It was received within the time frame that was promised and service was spectacular.
B0038P80CO|5.0|As others have mentioned, if you enjoyed Alien(s), The Descent, or Event Horizon, you'll probably like this as well. Scary and suspenseful with only a necessary and sufficient gore level. Though I'm a very amateur judge of this (I could barely name you the actors, if asked), I'd say the acting and dialogue are at least above average for the genre. Set design and ambiance similar to Aliens. The only mild criticism that comes to mind, though not during the movie since I was on the edge of my seat, is that few elements of the set or plot struck me as very original. Maybe that's an occupational hazard for sci-fi lovers and novelty seekers. Nevertheless an 'A-movie' in my book!
B000O1799U|5.0|This DVD was worth every dime that was paid for it. DVD was smooth and clean. It was received within the time frame that was promised and service was spectacular.

B00BD2DRHW|5.0|I thought since my husband worked construction many years ago, I could show him I could what I learned with just some common sense. Well, I have faired well in the beginning. BUT, this game is so cute and fun and frustrating at time. And I am not as smart as I thought I was. I am still learning and it is a challenge at times. But, I determined to build these bridges no matter how many times, I have to rebuild each and every segment. So there. Anyone want to challenge me?<br /><br />Just kidding. I really love this little game. It keeps my mind free of some stresses of the day from time to time. I have used other products such as Hidden Objects, all are rather boring, but this one is fun and I always have to come back to it and &#34;Try, Try again.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I highly recommended this book to anyone and will probably read it more than once.
B0083Z6AH6|3.0|Very slow to get into with many unnecessary detail in parts. Overall good read by Jane Austen that embraces hope in love lost and found again.
B003WE9TU8|3.0|Max brooks sets this plot up perfectly.... And then just wraps it up in a neat bow... Was five stars up to the middle...
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|This game is okay but it wasn't great.  I  don't really see any challenges so I don't play it to often
147674355X|5.0|One of the very best books I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Such a beautiful story. I was in tears multiple times right along with these characters. Read this book! Colleen Hoover does not disappoint!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett is a great writer, and like his previous series, once you start you must read every book.  Great!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great game! It is very fun and is a great way to just take time to relax but it gives me a head ache after twenty minutes. But I'm kind of a baby. Everything gives me headaches basically.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sheryl's book is a must read for girls 16+yrs old. I'm recommending to my young adult daughter today. Thank you Sheryl, I admire the strength it took you to share!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's the best game on my kindle fire. If l would rate this game I would rate it a  10!!!!!!!  I love this game it's great
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Really? I waited how many months for this?? What a waste - not enough substance to keep us interested in the plot and wonder of trying to figure out 'who done it'... Not sure I'll bother with the next one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this a long time ago but I'm doing a review now, it's a good game and I love the pc version and this was almost the same, but honestly why doesn't it update its been 4 days since the 0.7.0 update and I still haven't got it, even when my kindle updated it still doesn't update, please do Somthing about this!!! I'm really angry about this and I hate that it doesn't update when it's SUPPOSED to Update! Please do Something about this. Please...
B00A81MV3U|4.0|...liked it, third act saved it.  Big fan of Robert DeNiro and like his work in most of his films, like the actress who plays his wife, she was good.  Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are appealing actors and enjoy their work, thought most all the other actors were good. Regarding story, I understood why the Bradley character fell in love with Jennifer, she's young and beautiful and spent most of the film trying to engage and interact with him; wasn't clear in the story why she fell in love with him; he showed some kindness to her when he defended her honor, but thought story could have shown more the quality of his character when he was with her.  After Bradley's character begins taking his medication, he is kinder and better able to connect with his family, but Jennifer doesn't witness that.  He begins the story as a young man with mental problems, almost but not quite stable, initially refusing medication, jobless, living at home with his parents after leaving a mental institution; the story begins with him in the institution, and being sprung by his mother before he is really ready.  Story doesn't really explain why a gorgeous young woman would fall for him; he's handsome, he's somewhat kind to her, but the romance is not proved strongly enough in the story - she enters the story caring for him, and the story never explains why.  As I said, act 3 saves it, and the tender scenes between Robert DeNiro and Bradley's father and son help sell Bradley's character as a good guy, and other parts of the story help that portrayal as well (he finally begins taking meds after a wrestling match/fight with his parents), but I think it would have been better had she not entered the story already liking him; left the audience out of the loop on her character motivation.  3 and 3/4 stars, rounded up to 4.
B000FC13MM|2.0|I expected to like this book. I mean hell, hundreds of people gave it good reviews, even the sample was intriguing. This book was horrible. I made myself finish it. I'm so mad that I wasted my money on this book instead of buying a more intriguing read. Maybe I'm missing something that everyone else is seeing or I don't know but I just couldn't get into this book. The whole Abhorsen idea is brilliant, the author just didn't do a good job delivering. The author goes from being extremely vague to overly descriptive. Sometimes it was just too much to comprehend. Especially scenes involving the bells. He just focused on the wrong things. This book has so much potential, but unfortunately it reads like one of those horrible books you're assigned in your literature class. It's torture. Sabriel and Touchstone fall in love but we have no idea why. They hardly even speak to each other. The most they've ever talked is when they pronounce their love for each other. That was very frustrating. I just didn't get any enjoyment from this book, it was a task to finish it. Maggot did make it a bit bearable. I enjoyed his character but there's so many unanswered questions about him. You never find out what he really is, how he survived or how he wound up being a servant to the Abhorsens. Maybe the answers are in the other books of the trilogy, but I, for one, will NOT be finding out.
B008R6MI8G|5.0|Great movie and enjoyed it a lot.  Don't miss out on this one for sure.  Liam N did an awesome job.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I absoulutely loved this movie the actors were great the story line was great except i missed the openening of the loric chest from the book not being in the movie but watever still a great movie,5*
B009MYARIK|4.0|This book seemed quite different from Sophie Kinsella's other work. As a long-time fan who has read and absolutely loved every book of hers, it took me a little while to realize what the difference was for me: in all her other books, the main characters are usually very likeable, however imperfect. Lottie, on the other hand, often times got on my nerves with her stupidity and foolishness. (However, I do realize that this may be because she bears some resemblance to my mother who tends to make foolish choices with men)  : )<br />Despite Lottie's foolish choices, I grew to like her, and she made the right (if not predictable) choice in the end.<br /><br />I will always love Kinsella's work and always eagerly await any new novel she comes out with!
B009EP3DJM|4.0|I really didn't become a big Ke$ha fan until the tail-end of her \\"Cannibal\\" period, but at that point I fell hard for the all-out fun music that Ke$ha brings. After what seems like forever, Ke$ha finally released her 3rd album (not counting the remix album) in December, 2012.<br /><br />\\"Warrior\\" (12 tracks plus 4 bonus trakccs; 59 min.) starts off with a brooding title track, and then jumps into the lead-off single \\"Die Young\\", an infectuous song and one of the better tracks on here. 2nd single \\"C'mon\\" is alright, but a curious choice for a single as there are quite a few better songs on here. Such as 3rd single \\"Crazy Kids\\", another highlihg on the album. \\"Dirty Love\\" features Iggy Pop, not that you would notice as such as I can't hear him at all on it. Supernatural\\" is another upbeat track. The album closer \\"Love Into the Light\\" is a fantastic send-up/trobute to Phils Collins' \\"In The Air Tonight\\" and a great way to close out the album. The \\"deluxe edition\\" comes with 4 bonus songs, most of which are great: \\"Last Goodbye\\" is a touching break-up song, \\"Gold Trans Am\\" is as sure fire Joan Jett as anything Jett has done herself, and \\"Out Alive\\" is a massive dance tune and the very best song on this entire album. \\"Past Lives\\" is unnecessary.<br /><br />In all this is quite the album. The more you play, the more you will like it. But to see it live is better yet: I Ke$ha just played here in Cincinnati this past weekend at the Shoe, and Ke$ha and her band and dancers put on a non-stop gigantic dance party, it was so much fun. She played a ton from \\"Warrior\\" (9 songs, including \\"Supernatural\\" for the first time ever, she announced), along with the greatest hits from Animal/Cannibal. If you have a chance to see her in concert, do not miss it! Meanwhile \\"Warrior\\" is definitely worth checking out.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I like the monster part. I like the game the best because it is the first kind of monster game I have ever played and now it is the #1best.Look at the game and give it a try and If I do it so can you. So try it . I did it so can you.
B001DF68MA|1.0|My boyfriend bought this for my son without my input.  Has to be returned.  It wouldn't even fit my son's toy doll(let alone him)!  He's in the 10% in weight, 50% height, so he is certainly not a large kid.  He just turned one and if I could score this less than one star, I would!  We can't even use it and it needs to be returned.  I'm not sure what child they were designing this for, but I know they say to be at LEAST one before getting in a bike seat.  May work if your child is in the 1% height range.  I would only recommend if you are buying an overpriced toy to put a cabbage patch doll in.  Totally worthless!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had great hopes that people who do evil things pay for their sins. How disappointed I was to see that this evil woman was able to permanently manipulate and torture her spouse. But maybe after all, he was a masochist and they both deserve one another.
B002I9Z8B2|4.0|I wasn't really hoping for much, just a good copy of the movie, and I got it and then some. Some of the extra features were nice, especially the commentaries. I just wish the movie didn't open on a couple of ads every time I put it on. It's a bummer clicking past them to the movie.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I love Trespassing, the whole album is great, and in my opinion, so much better than For Your Entertainment. Trespassing is more edgy, fresh, original, creative, artistic, take you to another level. Is different to the current pop music (very boring for me in general). My favorites tracks: Cuckoo, Kick in, Shady, Trespassing... Underneath, Outlaws of love... and I am totally obsessed with Runnin, his voice in this song is... like a drug for the ears. I can't even describe it. Ah Nirvana! is great too... and Pop that Lock!<br />I guess.. the only song of the whole album that I'm not crazy about is Never Close Your eyes.<br />So, even if you are not Adam Lambert fan, you would love this gem.<br />This is the kind of work that deserves awards.
B00AOCLWF6|2.0|I realize I'm in the minority, however this series to me is just another &#34;one of many&#34; that tells the same story, in a very lengthy manner,  that's been told many times with a few revisions.  Aliens invade and the few humans that are left must scramble for their lives, group together and attempt to defeat them etc., etc. . . .  Think about it. . . a ninety minute movie would be enough to satisfy ones appetite for an old story told yet again, but a series on it?  Oh yeah, and the aliens still miss a lot when they shoot. . .you'd think light years of technology would give them an edge.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|It certainly wasn't what I expected (taking the previews at face value), however the message was much larger. I liked it.
B005ZB91KY|3.0|Sure it's another super hero movie from the past done with the technology of today.  I like it and was entertained.
1573300403|5.0|MJ was so talented. This dvd shows the range of his talent and imagination...and the lucky people he chose to work with were the best of the best. Every time I see the DVD I thinks of how excited the dancers must have been to work with him.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Short and somewhat surprisingly so, The Room was worth the price and the few hours it took to solve. Make sure you play with earbuds in. The audio is not germane to the game, but what you hear adds to the game's experience. The puzzles are challenging enough without being maddening, and more experienced puzzle gamers may be disappointed.

193700788X|2.0|Spoiler free section:<br />The best part about the series has been how it draws you in and makes you feel attached to the characters and the events. However, it is hard to come up with new events book after book - many an author has started to fall flat when they just couldn't come up with a way to 'top' the previous books in the series. I felt like this series was really just getting stretched to thin. The whole book felt extremely detached, and well, rather predictable.<br /><br />There were several events that should have felt emotional - but they didn't. They just sort of occurred. In an odd way, Sookie going on a random shopping trip seemed to have more emotional pull than the actual plot of the story. Not only that, but characters kept popping in and out to make sure you knew they were there, but aside from displaying how Sookie started the series as an outcast, but then came to acquire and recognize tons of friends & supporters, didn't really add to the story itself. And the story itself was rather dull - again, I think the lack of focus made it seem too detached. There wasn't even really a villain to hate, or to see in shades of gray, or even any moral choices.<br /><br />In fact, one of the biggest failures of the book in my mind was that Sookie really didn't make any decisions. A bunch of stuff happened, and she went with it, but she didn't really choose anything. (More in the spoiler section below)<br /><br />It was also rather predictable - I had stopped reading the series a few books back, but a friend handed it to me, and I thought why not. I cavalierly gave him my prediction for the ending - which it turned out was correct.<br /><br />That said, while the story was lacking, the writing itself was still good enough that even though I had originally flipped to the middle and started skimming, I actually went back to the beginning and... well, started skimming. But I did read the entire thing. The ending itself wasn't bad in theory, it was just not a well executed, engaging story.<br /><br />I wouldn't say don't borrow a copy and at last skim through to see the author's view, but I couldn't recommend buying it in hard cover, and now that I've skimmed my friend's copy, I don't intend to purchase it myself. YMMV<br /><br />**SPOILERS BELOW**<br />** SPOILERS BELOW**<br /><br />The last thing I really remember reading in the series was the announcement that Eric's sire had engaged him to some other vampire, and somehow there was a vampire law that if your sire engages you, you have to go through with it, even if really makes no sense. So at the time I came to the conclusion that the author wanted Sookie to end up with Sam, with whom she could have babies and who's been the guy 'waiting in the wings' the whole time. It seemed rather forced. AND it takes the 'choice' away from Sookie. Instead of making a morally ambiguous choice of turning away from her love because of her own desire for children and a 'normal' life, instead of Sookie having some hard soul searching about whether or not these things really were more important to her than Eric, she gets an easy out. She doesn't choose a life in the sun over Eric, Eric chooses... to essentially go into a loveless marriage for political reasons and/or survival over a fraction more of his life spent with Sookie. Thus leaving Sookie to have a happily ever after guilt free.<br /><br />Now, there are some complaints that Sookie ends up just a barmaid - again, the ending I don't mind. I think it's a perfectly acceptable \\"hero's journey\\" to show that someone went full circle, and ended up where they started, only they have learned that THEY have changed, and therefore didn't need to change their circumstances. But at best that was only hinted at. Sookie is more or less passive the whole way through. Unlike previous novels where she's been out making things happen, she's been solving mysteries, she's been triggering events, instead she's just a hapless bystander. She doesn't haveto be a badass battle witch like Pam or the newly added Karin, but if the author is going to imply that Sookie is like them, and if she'd become Eric's child would have been peas in a pod... then she should at least act like it.<br /><br />Likewise, Sam seems like a perfectly acceptable choice for a love interest. He's been with her from the beginning. He's been her friend, there's been hints the whole way through that he was interested, but I kind of got the impression that he was too chicken to act on it. And in this book he STILL hardly acts on it. Instead of comforting Sookie on her ordeals, instead of having emotional scenes where  Sookie & Sam discuss what their friendship means to them, or Sookie's decision to save Sam's life (a choice not made in this book), or where Sookie reveals the emotional turmoil she's had in her dealings with Eric, Sam just hides through most of the book, until wham, suddenly it's seXors time. Maybe that's not too unrealistic, but it doesn't make for a very satisfying story.<br /><br />That and the main plot seems to be the wrap up of Sookie & Eric and the transition to her happily ever after relationship. The 'mystery' seemed somewhat randomly thrown in to help along the relationship plot, and had an anticlimactic wrap up. If the book was really supposed to be about the relationships, just accept that, make it about the relationships and do it well. Instead it just felt like a bunch of words on paper without the excitement or emotion of the earlier books in the series. Farewell Sookie, it seems it was time for your story to end.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|The author really developed the Bailey character throughout the entire book.  But when it got to the end he was barely mentioned.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Love love loved this book. Bought everyone in the series after reading the first one. Has everything, angels, vamps, the food bad and the ugly  ...cant wait for the movie....but trust me books are always better!
B00BUAEYVK|1.0|Despite the gratuitous destruction, violence, blood and non stop action--this movie is BORING!  I fell asleep in it twice--and I never do that. It was cartoonish, despite the serious nature of the thin plot. Bruce Willis' character was soooo cliche as a bad father out to win the affection of his son, I caught myself rolling my eyes--when they weren't closed.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Read in order.....a gotta have . Excellant author. You will love this book! Buy all in the series. You will be craving the next one.
B00A8M7H42|5.0|got it right away and in great shape I will defiantly buy from them again for my next statue cant wait
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I got this for my wife to watch on the Kindle. She loved it. Only thing is to watch the earlier versions first, watch them in order and the story line is easier to fallow.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|His best book. If you liked his others, you will love this. You can't put it down and it is the kind of book that will stay with me for a very long time.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|While I quite often found myself torn between anguish and intrigue, tears streamed down my face this entire read and I loved every second of it!
B0063IH60K|1.0|The game itself is good but sometime, you can not get rid of those ads that come suddenly in front of you. You have to close the app and sometimes the entire program. I do not recommand this game unless you like being invaded by the pub.
B0076UXKDG|1.0|Wow!! Come on NIKON!!!! Really! How do you justify the price of this grip. The 35mm 1.8 prime lens does not cost this much! Get a grip on 'Reality'!

B000J670ZI|3.0|It was a great movie! Enjoyed the instant streaming technology available to me. Cary Grant was very attractive man in his day.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm having crossfire withdrawals already!!! Please don't make us wait too long. So looking forward to a happy ending for everyone.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|Great product, been interested in this for a while and finally got it for a great price. I appreciate the quality and service provided.
B008BM9L72|3.0|I didn't think it lived up to the hype. In-fact the main character kind of got on my nerves always talking about her &#34;inner goddess&#34;.
B006LA6IW2|5.0|Great book I would suggest it to anyone interested in the armed forces. Thanks for our freedom troops!!!!! Keep up the good work.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Have you ever wanted a look inside a guy's mind? Well here you go. This book is funny, romantic, sexy, and insightful.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Me and my little sister love this game. It takes up time and I like it because you can make it any way you want it. I suggest to get it.
B000001F5A|4.0|This album is COLD ! Vangelis' synthesizer work captures the utter chill and desolation of the continent, complete from crystalline ice to howling wind. I have three copies of this on three different vinyl pressings and never tire of the sonic depths this music contains. The CD never arrived - someone in the USPS system decided they needed it more than I, so all I received was an empty bubble wrap envelope with a &#34;Delivered without contents&#34; stamp from USPS. I bought the CD elsewhere - from a dedicated music outlet online service.
B006BQM762|4.0|I watched it with my teenage daughter and 7 yr old granddaughter. It kept them both entertained. I'd watch it again.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Once you get used to the how the game works it is a real blast. Try it, it will really work your brain.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|decent game play, but many logic flaws and &#34;this should work, but doesn't&#34; situations that are kinda annoying. It bugged me. Advertisement was annoying too.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|When I first started watching the series, I didn't think I was going to like it. BUT, by the end of the first episode I was hooked!  Love it!
B009NY43NY|1.0|There's little doubt Charlaine Harris has been writing these last few novels under duress; you can tell she has had it with these characters, this story, this series.  (And by &#34;duress,&#34; I mean she's under contract to write for big bucks on a topic she founds uninteresting.)  The plot is primitive, the writing uninspired (to say the least), and the outcome random.  Although I understand her frustration and dilemma (to continue to make money off a &#34;hot&#34; intellectual property vs. spending her time writing something she has come to abhor), I wish she would have just said, &#34;I'm done&#34; sooner.  It's sad because she really is a talented writer.  I hope she has made enough money that her next series can play out the way she really wants it to.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|i likes that is was not predictable.had me jump a couple of times, any movie that can keep me watching is a winner.
B009KWU6Q2|4.0|The movie was great quality.  My kids loved it a d it was good to have a flash back to the past
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I use this app to remind me to change the laundry to the drier, time my sweet potato fries and loads of other stuff. Works perfectly on my Kindle Fire.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I didn't expect it to do everything in the world, just what they said it would, and it does that perfectly. I especially like that it estimates the amount of time I have left on this charge.
B008GOG98Y|5.0|Great coming of age movie, even if it is dated. It is the age old story of rich and privileged verses poor
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Loads of fun for my whole family. Thanks for bringing an old classic to the digital age! We play as a team with the multiple card feature. Even our 4 year old enjoys playing.
B004IAKU9O|2.0|This was a boring movie and very predictable. Even as I write this I don't remember the movie anymore...totally forgettable
B00COHAUD4|4.0|I'm the type who prefers a good drama or a suspenseful thriller to horror movies, due to a bad experience once.  I have a vivid imagination and I'm prone to nightmares, so I usually stay away from this genre.  However, I was in the mood for something different so I gave this one a go.  I figured a PG-13 rating rendered it fairly safe.  Let me just say that I was plesantly surprised.  The storyline is one that tugs at your heartstrings, which is rare in horror films.  The performances delivered by the two youngest members of the cast are superb, especially the older of the sisters.  If they stay with it, I foresee a bright future for these two girls.  The rest of the cast is also amazing as a family coping with the challenges that come along with taking in two feral children who had no contact with other human beings.  Some very tender moments ensue.<br /><br />The unveiling of the \\"Mama\\" character and her true identity, and her desire to keep the girls all to herself propels the film forward.  It's interesting to discover how she came to be, seeing as how it would be almost impossible for a toddler and a pre-schooler to survive in the woods alone for five years.  Although she is the typical sinister, other-worldly being in films of this type, she wins some cool points from me for protecting the girls for so long.  However, she is also what detracts from the scariness of the film.  Although I am not a big horror fan, as previously stated, I feel that if a movie is meant to scare you, the appearance of the scary creature should at least be somewhat frightening.  We went most of the movie without seeing her face and for good reason- her movements are much more frightening.  After seeing Mama for the first time in all her glory, I was no longer unnerved.  She only became truly scary when angry, which only happened like two times.  I watched the rest of the film unaffected.  CGI is just not very scary, in my opinion.  I actually miss the days of stage makeup and the creativity and skills of a really good makeup artist.  The \\"Thriller\\" characters gave me the creeps as a little girl and are still quite horrific to look at even now.  Since this is a PG-13 movie, I understand the creators may not have wanted to go too far, but moviewatchers should still jump in anticipation when the music changes at the very least.  Maybe some still did, but I watched in peace knowing there was no reason to truly be afraid.<br /><br />Overall, this was a really good movie with great performances by the main characters and a great storyline.  As stated by another reviewer, I too was not a fan of the ending, but I would still rewatch this movie in a heartbeat.  If you are looking for a real scare, this is not the movie for you.  If you're looking for a scary movie for the whole family to enjoy, this is a good choice.  If you prefer a good story with superb acting and a darker theme, sit back and enjoy!!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Ok, I have read the mono vs. stereo, the review/star rating debate going on.<br />Have listened to both, and lemme tell you, the Mono is IMHO better.<br />The stereo mixes of the 60's were not that great, songs like drive my car, hey bulldog, to name a couple, sound way much better than the (left-right) stereo mix.<br />I was born in the 70's, so there is no nostalgic feeling in this review, just simple, plain, point of view.<br />In all, the mono sounds better.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|James Altucher is an oddball. If you've read his blog or receive his emails, you know this. And if you keep reading his work like me, you probably love that he's an oddball. We've got enough normal lemmings running around. I'm tired of normal.<br /><br />James makes a lot of uncomfortable observations about the global recession, American laziness, habits of storing up temporary treasures on earth, and more. Observations that you may completely agree with or completely ignore. It doesn't matter. That isn't his point.<br /><br />James hits on a ton of practical ways that he thinks bring stability and sanity to a person's life. No get-rich-quick or easy ways out. But plenty to inspire if you're willing. If you're not willing, that's fine. James will sleep with a clear conscience because he did his part by sharing what has worked (and failed miserably) in his life.<br /><br />Read this book. I'm pretty sure you'll release some oxytocin at least once during your reading.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|In reading this it took my breath away. Looking forward to reading more about Gedion and Eva and a wedding. Crossfire novels is one of the reasons I have been reading non-stop. I do hope their is more to come I wil keep checking your web site, to see when and if their will be more on Gedion and Eva..  Was a fast read,But great story. Thank you
B00B2V66VS|5.0|addicting is all I will say.  my son got this and I am playing it more than he is.  you will not regret it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this an ok game. it glitches a lot for me and it aggravates me if it doesn't work properly. it is a really fun otherwise I really like to play it if I don't have a good book to read or I don't want to play another game or even if I don't have wifi.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Although there have been a ton of space-related movies since this was released, this still holds up wonderfully.  If you enjoy the slow-pace analysis of finding the treasure, you should definitely enjoy this movie.  Jodie is also a pleasure in this one.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|This is a wonderful book. It is unpredictable, yet still interesting. There is many twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. I would recommend this to any one who loves science fiction or mysteries, although it is a great read for anyone looking for a good book. Some parts are confusing, and I had to reread them, but other than that, it is a great book! I will be looking for other books by Rebecca Stead to read.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|The book's underlining idea was pretty great and the writing overall was smooth and I liked the charactes too a lot. The biggest problem with the book was with suspension of disbelief. For me implementation of the concept was a bit too in-your-face and the way the characters reacted to it felt unplausible.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I didn't expect to enjoy it much, but was pleasantly surprised. Tom Cruise does a good job in the role.<br /><br />PS - Haven't read the book. Don't know if it is a good representation of it or not.
B00005MP58|5.0|I loved this series and have watched it every single time it has been on TV.  I finally just had to order it so I could watch it whenever I wanted to.  The story never gets old and the actors (especially Colin Firth) just make my day a little happier just by being around for the few hours I can escape into the story.
1878424319|5.0|The author teaches us how to live better without worrying what the world thinks of us ,how to truly be free to be our self and not what society has thought us to be.
193700788X|5.0|I was both sad and happy to hear that the Sookie Stackhouse series was coming to an end.  I loved it!  The ending was everything I wanted it to be.  Sookie ended up with the person I had hoped she would.  Thank you Charlaine Harris for the perfect happy ending.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Nothing but great things to say about this app!<br /><br />Nice look to the graphics.<br /><br />Works well, just as advertised..<br /><br />Worth the price. I would purchase again, and again..<br /><br />I have tried a few battery apps, this one is the best!
B00AK57N00|5.0|I play this game everyday and love to get a new highscore everytime. its function play and the audio is fantastic.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I need more of Gideon and Eva!! Does anyone know when the next book will be released. I just can't wait.
B0090KZDSK|4.0|U know how to makes us feel alive sylvia day now i cant stop thinking about it who was the 2nd person.mysterious .loved it anyway
B00CW665VI|5.0|I read a lot of fiction.  This book captured my attention on many levels.  It's an unusual move for a woman to write from a man's POV - and my field research with men says she nailed it (no pun intended!).  This is well written, fast paced, very human in its examination of relationship foibles, and Funny!  Very very funny!  I'm only sorry there aren't yet other books published by Emma Chase and I am genuinely looking forward to her future stories.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I just couldn't put it down....amazing doesn't even begin to describe it !!! Can't wait for the second one !! Losing Hope
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|It's a clever movie.  Enjoyed watching it.  Good movie over all.  Only a few required words left in my review.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Took over an hour to initially load game data but once it was done it was<br /> fine. Great graphics and story. Not finished it yet but happy so far.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|The game takes some time to get used to and time to build up. But once u get into it it gets really fun.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Quick fun read for a vacation- interesting approach but most of the story was predictable...most but not all. The good part was in the details. The writing quality/language is quite simple. Would read again, but would only maybe recommend to a friend.
1936608898|5.0|This is a great book, haven't finished it as yet, but what I have read is absolutely fantastic, this is going to change my life, thank you. Lill
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It works for me to wake up on the morning to do exercise and for school to so it's really awesome for me and my family
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a fun game. It passes the time. I first started playing this game on my phone. It is nice that they change the versions of the game every now and then. Great graphics on the Kindle
B008JJM88Q|1.0|I downloaded this app thinking it would be fun for a party with my friends.  It wasn't.  It asks you so many questions about your person so that it's almost obvious who the person you're thinking of is.  Also, a few days after i had gotten this, I couldn't get onto my kindle without restarting it and letting it update, however, that may have been another app that I had downloaded a few days after.  Do not pay the money for this one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i really cant wait for the next update (0.7.0) for some reason my two friends got the update before i did? oh well... its suppose to come this week thats all i know! The new version us just like the computer version, it has water buckets, lava buckets, ACCESS TO THE NETHER AND AETHER PORTAL :DDD and animal/mob spawners!!! Omg cant wait!!!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|It was a movie filled with action and a good story line in the years of slavery.  Good cast, well performed.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Excellent book... The author shares his experiences in Auschwitz and his observations of the human being behavior when submitted to extreme conditions.<br />Really, the human being is this creature who always decides what to be and how to proceed.<br />I learned a lot about the nature of men.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|A well told story of escape from tyranny.  It is possible that the lion was imagined or maybe not. You decide.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|This show had you wanting more at the season's end.  Would like to see the life events of Henry's heirs as a continuation.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The family dynamics and the look into the staff activities is interesting.  It is good to have a clean, family entertainment choice.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|can't stop playing... then the game ends.... seems too short... but fun nonetheless... scenes are neat, finding tools isn't too challenging, just the right amount of difficulty.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Very funny and very true. It touches on many real life issues that patents have when child's and child birth is involved
B001VLXNLU|5.0|Brilliant, absolutely brilliant. finally a book series that keeps me up all night. Completely had me in a fictional trance!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This story is an unapologetic look into one man's experiences in the ongoing GWOT.<br /><br />I picked up this book because I saw Chris Kyle on History's Sons of Guns last season and wanted to learn more. After reading, and with all we are heard regarding his untimely death, I encourage everyone to at least give it a read.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This is a great show.  The acting is good and the characters are fun.  One of the best on Prime.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Actually its more like a 6.<br />I didn't think I would enjoy this game as much a<br />I do! Love the challenge of driving in different roads.<br />Wish they offered a female driver...most people will find many hours of entertainment from this game!
B00992CF6W|1.0|As if we didn't wait long enough for an update kindle owners now get to be the absolute last people to get an update?  I am so sorry I didn't get an ipad.  I have never been so frustrated.  Poor service Amazon!
B009JBZH54|5.0|I think the title says it all.  Watch them back-to-back-to-back and you'll sleep hanging upside down, maybe.  The second movie is still the best though.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Great insight to live your life fully. The guide made me realize we are all blessed with so many gifts.
B00867GHS8|4.0|I don't know how much the 3D added to the show, but it forced me to see it again and it's still fun.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|its really fun for all ages I hope every one enjoys it as much as I do and it can be played by both genders
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I was not sure what to expect of te movie since I have never been a Capt. A.  fan but i have to say that it was Full of action,
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome because you get lots of games and choices<br />its just so awesome you could really play lots of games
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Despite the many reviews that only give this book an overall rating of 3 starts it is still a great book and I look forward to seeing what the future holds for Gideon & Eva.  I would highly recommend reading the third book regardless of what the hundreds have written and given the book a bad rating.  The story itself is well written and most are just put out that they have to purchase further books to get the rest of the story.  Sylvia is a great writer and it is her story to write for us whether its in one book or five books.
B00AK57N00|4.0|The game is addictive and fun but not worth a dollar. Luckilly I got it for the free app of the day
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|I started this movie way too late one evening, but once I began watching it was impossible not to finish in one sitting. This is very well done crime story and psychological thriller. A How-and-Why-done-it rather then a Who-done-it. Tom Cruise is in top form in a mission-impossible (i.e., mentally and physically superior) type character who is requested by the sniper suspect in a seemingly open-and-close multiple-murder case immediately before the suspect is beaten into a coma due to being under-supervised in transport with other prisoners. It's a very odd request since Jack Reacher is the person who in the past had relentlessly pursued this man and attempted to imprison him for a similar crime committed as a solider.<br /><br />This is a smart and well-executed fast pace movie that will make you think as you try to figure out who is behind the murders and why and what is Jack Reacher's deal anyways.<br /><br />The one aspect that was not to my personal liking is that the last 30-40 minutes after the crime was solved it sort of switch-genres and turned into pure action-adventure-chase-and-shoot-em-up. This may appeal to people who like both crime-thrillers (which I do) and action-violence (not so much). In my opinion a \\"less-is-more\\" approach to the movie would have made it even greater.
B000FA675C|5.0|I never loved art or cared to learn about artists until this book.  It is so intense, and creative.  Then, I loved watching the movie to follow it.
B00BN0BZVY|5.0|Pat People's has lost track of time in the months or years that he's been in a neural health facility aka \\"the bad place\\" with presumably some sort of head trauma. Now he's living at home in his parent's basement, obsessively working out in the home gym his doting mother has bought him, and he's hoping to end \\"the apart time\\" with his estranged wife Nikki. Pat relies on an assortment of pills and many routines, including kissing Nikki's freckled nose each evening from a picture he keeps on his bedside, to keep it all together. His father is emotionally and physically distant and pretty much an SOB; his Dad's mood for the whole week is largely determined by the outcome of each Sunday's Eagle's football game. Pat Sr. has little to do with his eldest son other than leaving the daily sports page at the top of the stairs for him to read. Tiffany, the sister-in-law of his Pat's best friend, seems to be stalking Pat on his daily runs or perhaps scouting him for some special mission.<br /><br />This is the story of an optimist who is able to feel very deeply struggling to stay positive, believe in the impossible, and practice being kind rather than right despite struggles with depression, anger management, a troubled home-life, and overwhelming odds. It is the story about facing one's past, finding friendship and love after-love, and seeking, recognizing, and appreciating life's silver lining moments.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Don't watch the timer at the bottom of the screen because it will only serve to distract you.  This is a fun game that gets to be addictive as you go through each level.  The game seems to have an unlimited number of levels which keeps you interested and the layouts for several of the levels vary.  On some of them, just when you think you will win the level you run out of time. I like the sounds and how they make the screen jiggle from time to time so it throws you a bit off balance when you are playing and trying to focus.
B00D2CYV9E|5.0|This is an intriguing and bizarre story of Liberace told through the eyes of his many-year companion Scott. I read an article about this prior to seeing it and wish I'd been more surprised by the unfolding events. This a the kind of story that is better to come into blind, without reading plot-spoiling articles or reviews. So if you are thinking about watching his film, do.<br /><br />The A-team performances of Micheal Douglas as Liberace, Matt Damon as Scott, Debbie Reynolds as Liberace's controlling mother, and Rob Lowe as the vain, doctor (painfully over-done with plastic surgery) are flawless. Dan Ackroyd as Liberace's avaricious agent is excellent as well. The two main performances are riveting - Oscar performance worthy, though with the HBO distribution I guess this film will not be eligible for an Oscar. Douglas unwaveringly nails Liberace's voice and mannerism, and the film seamlessly intersperses footage of the real Liberace as a young man; Damon once again shows his incredible range as an actor playing the polar opposite of the tough guy, bad boy, heart throb role. The makeup in this movie is simply amazing. Micheal Douglas is transformed into the spitting image of Liberace and various characters age, gain and lose mass, and go through other appearance-changing life issues.<br /><br />Scott is a naive and talent animal trainer and aspiring vet who meets Liberace through a friend and starts to treat Liberace's poodle. As a child, Scott had been through many families in the foster system and as a young man is seeking a acceptance, love, and a father figure. He quickly becomes drawn into Liberace's flamboyant public life and bizarre private life; after the elderly poodle dies Scott even takes on the dog's nickname. A great film that I'd love to see released on the big screen.<br />PS - I have to disagree with some of the other reviewers on one point: Matt Damon was well cast given the age range of his character throughout the movie.att Damon was well cast given the age range of his character throughout the movie. Also I think he's looking  mighty fine!
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|why wont this game update. apple updates this game so much quicker. why wont you update your apps amazon?<br />update amazon!!!!!

B0094BB4TW|2.0|I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but the FB that came up from this app looked nothing like the regular FB page.  I was hoping I could take pics and directly put them on FB , but the FB icon doesn't come up in my choices to share.  So, I uninstalled it and just go to FB on the internet.

B000QDA7OU|5.0|I saw this movie when I was about 10 years old and I have seen it countless times since then.  I still speaks to me as a small-C catholic when I look at some of the struggles that are going on in the Catholic church today over authority and ritual.  But even if you do not have a Catholic background, you can find yourself so absorbed in a woman's struggle to find her place in life, while being true to her inner voice.  Audrey Hepburn does such a wonderful showing such a range of emotions in Sister Luke and the movie, like the great book from which it was taken, do not slip into the obvious of making her run off with the doctor and live happily ever after.  She wants to be a good nun and live up to her vows and she does not treat them lightly.  Her decision to live was not so much a rejection of the convent life, but a desire to fulfill herself in a way that was meant for her.  I still get new insights into the idea of &#34;commitment&#34; every time I see this movie!
193700788X|5.0|I was so sad when Harris announced her final book, but I just read it and it was the best one yet.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Sadly, this is yet another author who doesn't understand what good serial  fiction is. \\"Eragon\\", \\"The Dragonbone Chair\\", although a bit verbose, are great serial fictions. \\"A Modern Witch\\" and \\"The Wizard of Bright Isle\\"  are examples of good serial fiction. What do they all have in common? The answer is simple, each book in  the series is a complete work.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the \\"Sorcerer's Ring\\" series is yet another in the recent trend of authors reaching a certain word count or number of pages/chapters and saying 'ok that's good enough' and publishing it as a \\"book\\" in a series. If you put all of pieces of this series together you might have a decent book...<br /><br />If it wasn't  for the fact that the author needed  to at least get a good proofreader, if not a good editor. It's clear that the author doesn't have a firm graspe of the meaning of quite a few words in her vocabulary, and it's quite jarring at times. You'll be reading an otherwise creative description of events and characters and creatures to stumble into a word use that is off the mark or completley inappropriate for the sceen/situation being described.<br /><br />If you can muddle through all of this and are willing to pay for an  overprice \\"serial fiction\\" it's not an entirely bad read.

B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I think I expected more from this album.  It's actually my first Justin purchase.  I've always been a fan, but never purchased his albums.  Still deciding if I like it.
B00D6BU8GG|1.0|I'm a huge fan of the Die Hard series, and this is why I was hugely disappointed by this iteration.  It has none of the elements that made the first 3 installments so enjoyable.  I quit watching after 15 minutes.  Stay away from this one.
B008220C38|4.0|If the creators of this movie had made this in a more traditional Masterpiece Theatre manner many of the objections on this thread would not apply.<br />I have decided instead to take the bad with the good.<br />Most agree that 1) It is not inclusive of all the events in the novel because it is only 2 hours long and 2) Why the artifice in which periodically we see events unfolding as if they are on a stage?<br />Be forewarned that this seems to be, inexplicably, an attempt at an avante garde touch that detracts from the story.<br />However, enough elements remain to make it a legitimate and poignant interpretation of a complex and sprawling novel about \\"relationships\\" and human moral limitations.<br />In the course of only 2 hours running time inevitably many threads of the story lines are confusing or just plain missing.<br />Some adaptations of great novels like this - Vanity Fair comes to mind - are much better suited to the superior extended mini series versions that preceded them on Masterpiece Theatre.<br />In this case there were two more coherent and well done previous series. One an extended two part miniseries fairly recently and a much longer 10 part series from 1977.<br />And then there was a quite beatiful movie done of it about a decade ago with Sophie Marceau and Sean Bean but with the same unavoidable defects due to limited running time but mercifully without all the \\"stage\\" artifice.<br />And two classic ones also with Garbo and Greer Garson. Garbo of all of the actresses playing this role is the best cast perhaps.<br />But Keira Knightly's performance and her ability to express an impressive emotional authenticity grew on me in this beautifully filmed, highly cinematic and imaginative version.<br />The lasting appeal and greatness of the novel pivots on the honesty of the characters involved.<br />Anna quite suddenly comes to a realization that she is infatuated with the somewhat mediocre Vronsky and blurts it all out to Karenin, her much older husband.<br />Whatever Victorian restraints existed in 1874 didn't apply so rigidly in Moscow Society in 1874 except in its insistence to keep up appearances.<br />When Anna asks Dolly, the wife of Anna's cheating brother who Anna had previously asked Dolly to forgive, \\"Do you blame me for what I have done?\\", Dolly unhesitantly says not at all. I wish I could have done the same but no one asked me to.<br />And then Karenin, badly stung by Anna's infidelity, admits his own uncharacteristic hatred of her but overcomes it by gratiously deferring to both Vronsky and Anna in separate scenes.<br />Though he too is dilatory in his committment to grant a divorce consistent with Tostoy's casting blame on ALL of his characters, refusing to ignore their moral failings and defects.<br />No one is quite up to one's own ideals and standards in the end.<br />And then there is Levin, whose story is not fully articulated. He is the \\"idealist\\" but in the novel he too is overwhelmed by circumstances and becomes far less saintly than he appeared to be.<br />Tolstoy's novel is astounding in its candid portrayal of his characters, warts and all.<br />The \\"webs we weave\\" he compassionately whispers to us. And all of us despite our better angels are susceptible to the cruel twists of fate and our own vulnerabilities he seems to be saying.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Unbelievable....Are you kidding me? I was very disappointed with the ending of Entwined With You. About two thirds through the book I stopped to read some of the reviews because I thought it was me that was so lost with the story line. Even though I lost interest at a certain point, I continued on because I wanted to get to the ending. I am an avid reader and I have never experienced an ending such as this. It seems the author stopped the story abruptly so that we would buy the next book to see what happens to Eva and Gideon...NOT... I'm done! and I'm mad.
B004S5FW1U|5.0|Luckily I read this before seeing the movie. This story is bitter sweet and gives an insight into mentally ill Pat and the effect of his illness on his family and friends. Part comedy part tradgedy. I laughed and cried on the journey to find a silver lining. I found the characters in the book far more believable than in the movie. Beautifully written we experience the trials and tribulations of a man who is finally free from a mental institution. He is lovable but frustrating at times.I read this book in a day.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|While it will never be the same without the late great Layne Staley, BTWTB proved that Alice In Chains have staying power and still sound like Alice In Chains. The new album, The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, further proves that point. The make up is a bit different in that the songs are longer, but I love that they have gone back to a darker, more sludge oriented sound that its predecessor found somewhat lacking. My favorite songs on the record, like \\"Pretty Done\\", \\"Hung On A Hook\\", \\"Lab Monkey\\", and the title track definitely have a sound reminiscent of what achieved on Facelift. Others like \\"Phantom Limb\\", \\"Hollow\\", and \\"Stone\\" are less comparable to their Staley Era material but still have that unmistakable Alice In Chains sound. Some of the acoustic songs like \\"Voices\\", \\"Low Ceiling\\", and \\"Choke\\" have a sound comparable to Jar Of Flies. Will Duvall is let loose singing lead on the songs \\"Hung On A Hook\\" and \\"Phantom Limb\\", the latter of which he also is playing lead guitar on. While I didn't like every song on the album, I can say the songs I did like are bound to be ranked among my all-time favorites. This album is absolutely worth the buy!!! \m/
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|i LOVE this app. it is good for random ideas, and organizing anything. creating new notebooks is really fun, and all u have to do is click on the + sign! i would avise people not to use the password. i typed in a letter wrong, and had to go to my kindle settings to delete all my notebook data. but now i can use my notebooks again. :) I LOVE THIS APP!!!!!
0345525558|5.0|I got more than I looked for in this novel.  It surpassed my expectation that I would enjoy it -- I loved it.  And I learned about something I had never thought about before, the Language of Flowers. I was fascinated by the aspect of communication demonstrated by the story's heroine, the ability to send a message without speaking, if your intended recipient shares your knowledge of that &#34;language.&#34;  The tragedy of abandonment, &#34;orphan&#34; care, and of homelessness are vividly and realistically portrayed.  And although some parts of the story may stretch one's credulousness, it remains an engaging piece of writing.  The characters are full-bodied and believable within the context of the narrative.  The love story that emerges is both painful and artfully created, and unconditional love is demonstrated is many ways. I found the ending satisfying without being trite or theatrical.  This book was a very enjoyable read for me, and I recommend it to you if you are interested in the symbolism of flowers, in societal issues, coming-of-age stories, romance or redemption.
B00992CF6W|2.0|So i got this game and I've had it for a while. The game updated the first time but it won't updates again... why
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I loved her first two books in the Crossfire series.  The characters were exciting, passionate and the story was fast paced.  This book is definitely none of those things.  While I has happy to read more about Eve & Gideon, I was extremely disappointed with the storyline and the author.  There are so many established secondary characters from the first 2 books yet she introduces other characters and does not focus on the previous storylines.  What was once an exciting story for readers has turned in to a never ending series purely for the author's profit.  What a shame!
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|As I played the game I got a water pump station but it wasn't there when I got back. The same goes for a dinosaur I got. When It said it was ready to hatch, it wasn't there. The missions I completed are still there. I am disappointed by the problem. Other than that the game is great.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Calculator Plus is a really great App; and its free. So much for the old adage that you get what you pay for. I highly recommend downloading it.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I'm a big Clancy fan, so I'll admit that right up front. This latest book builds on characters that are well known to Clancy fans, especially focusing on Jack Jr. and The Campus. Once I start his books, I find them hard to put down, and that was definitely the case once again with Threat Vector.
B007R6X9IK|5.0|I listened to a couple of the songs on YouTube and didn't think it was for me, not my kind of music, really, sounded too slow also, but one day I decided to order it.  I was blown away.  Dave's vocals are some of the best of his career (not an understatement), and the songs are really catchy in that they don't drag and are very melodic, which some of Dave's solo work is missing sometimes, melody.  Dave's songwriting is really strong on here.  I am surprised at how much I go back to this album to listen to.  The sound production is great.  He should be very proud of his collaboration with Soulsavers on this album.  YouTube has a 30 or 40-minute set they did showcasing some of the songs as he didn't have time to do any concerts supporting the album due to DM heading back into the studio.  Definitely worth watching.  Professionally shot.

B0050DZN4K|5.0|I picked up freely along with a couple of other reader apps as google reader was being discontinued and and this is the one I stuck with.

It has become a truly great app.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Ok, so I immediately had this in my wish list when it was available. I pre-ordered the book because I wanted to dig right in. I seriously had to wait a day after I finished the book before I wrote this review because if I had it would have only gotten one star. I waited far to long to find out this isn't the end. I wanted closure and feel abandoned. The first two books had me salivating, this book had me sighing with frustration. Why drag on the Brett story line, why drag on the Corrine story line? What happened to Cory? He's different in this book. I wanted to love this book, but I barely liked it. Will I buy the next book? I doubt it.

B008JJM88Q|5.0|As a kid, I had one of those round, purple 20 Questions toys. We and my friends would sit in tight huddle, excited, giggling, trying to trick the little ball into guessing wrong, and shriek with an almost frustrated delight when it didn't. We had all come to grudgingly respect the Orb of 20 Questions when sadly, it passed away in it's sleep. (I.E. Lack of battery power)<br /><br />Akinator the Genie is like 20 Questions, only it exchanged the question limit with a narrow focus on just characters throughout all mediums, instead of a broad anything like my old toy. But that doesn't make Akinator any less fun or entertaining!<br /><br />Fascinated by Mr. Akinator, a friend and I huddled together on my bed and set off on a mission to try and fool the genie. We were thwarted many, many times. Akinator starts by asking you broad character questions to narrow down the field, before stunning you with very specific questions -- anywhere from the name of the show/game your character is from, to describing psychical traits your character has. What impressed me the most is that he truly knows just about every character imaginable. My friend and I tried many times to trick him by using obscure characters from obscure works -- we even used anime characters and characters from Korean Manhwa. (It doesn't get less mainstream than a character that died after 3 chapters in a Korean Manhwa about the Wizard of oz). One after another, he guessed correctly. I managed to fool him a few times to the point he had to guess twice, but besides that, he always managed to guess my character.<br /><br />I would also like to point out that I heavily enjoyed the genie's humor -- if you constantly press &#34;yes&#34; or &#34;No&#34; in an attempt to fool him, he will guess something along the lines of &#34;You! A person who thinks he can trick me by choosing no all the time!&#34; He even has a guess for the person who tries to describe their own original character.<br /><br />All in all, Akinator is an extremely fun way to pass the time. Let's see if you can fool the genie~an extremely fun way to pass the time. Let's see if you can fool the genie~
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Loved the ending.  However, that was the best part of the book.  It was a little slow in places.  It was though worth the read, as Collins found a great way to end the series.

B00735HGQ6|4.0|I really should give this book  5 stars as I loved it from beginning to end.  It is well written and I felt O knew both Harold and his wife as they travelled along their path.  I am highly recommending it to all my friends.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This is the most engrossing, deep, innovative, and vast fantasy book I've read in ages. I finished this book with absolute regret that it was over. I haven't felt this way about ANY fantasy book since I read the first Wheel of Time book and became a fan. I loved the Mistborn series, but this is even better because I can't believe how original the various races and vision of the world is. It overwhelmed me with a sense of wonder that I'm not used to at my age.<br /><br />All I can say is this is another one of the few books I'll be able to read over and over and enjoy & find new clues in it every time.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Great in the aspect that, as the viewer, I find it to be a lot more believable and realistic than all the &#34;&#34;supposed reality&#34; shows out there. keeps you interested and nailed to your chair..This could be a great one!!
