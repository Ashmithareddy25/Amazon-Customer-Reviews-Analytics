B00DW3X07M|5.0|For those of you who aren't familiar with Virgil Donati he is one of the most amazing innovative drummers around. Period. His ability to play multiple time signatures simultaneously is rivaled by none that I've ever heard. I discovered him while listening to Steve Walsh's Glossolalia album and then rediscovered him playing with Derek Sherinian on some of his solo works and also with Planet X. I've been a devout fan ever since. This dude is freaking SICK!<br />On this record he really stretches the limits of my musical sensibilities which by most standards is miles beyond insane to begin with and has of course surrounded himself with the talent to pull off these maneuvers with seamless ease. It is simply mind blowing that someone can conceptualize & compose this kind of stuff let alone perform it to this degree. The compositions on this album are extremely complex and never really lets the listener get too comfortable with the deep grooves before the piece moves to the next tantalizing yet tension filled musical theme. This album is truly a prog-heads dream! After a few times through it all starts to make more musical sense and the ideas start to take on some relative familiarity. So as a colossal prog head I highly recommend this album to all the like minded freaks out there looking for more brain candy. If you think this might be a bit too radical of a place to start perhaps Planet X's Quantum would be a more musically friendly introduction to the world of the brilliant \\"Thunder from Down Under\\" Mr Donati.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Funny, smart, I hate that I love it!  Brings me back to high school, very fun.  Watched seasons 1 and 2 in straight succession, couldn't get enough!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Bought this book off the reviews I read! Thanks everyone loved it!<br /><br />fun easy to read and yes I did laugh out loud - got back on to see if there were more to the series but there isnt... darn!<br /><br />Buy it its very well written - funny and has great characters
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it so much so fun and the closest you can get to having a real horse if you have a horse this is still fun
B008JF8O9M|1.0|unfortunately this did not work on my LG  Escape phone although I don't know whether it was the phone or the printer that didn't work
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game is fun an mined using it drives me crazy. pisses me off an I love can put it down.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|The fantasy genre is sort of an inverse of the western. The past is inevitably a golden age: more powerful, more magic, more mysterious. On the other hand, westerns refer to the future. People are on the frontier because of its potential: the promise of future land, natural resources, wealth and so forth. Combining the two seems like a natural progression, but it's rarely done well.<br /><br />Abercrombie pulls it off in his latest installment of the First Law/Circle of the World series. The setting is the Old Empire, last seen in the original trilogy with massive ruins from an ancient and mysterious civilization. At the same time, Abercrombie has added Ghost People, a tribal population that may or may not be descended from the Old Empire. On top of it all, the Union is expanding into the region under somewhat dubious pretenses.<br /><br />I lay all this out because there are a lot of moving parts to this book. The world is complex in a way that it previously was not. It's not a criticism to say that the basic setup of the world was easy to grasp before Red Country: the Union as England, the North as Scotland/Ireland, Styria as Italy and Gurkhul as the Ottoman Empire. But the Old Empire, or Near and Far Country, is a lot murkier. There are obvious similarities to both the &#34;New World&#34; and old Europe, but it doesn't feel forced or shoehorned.<br /><br />The cast of characters is a familiar one, and the new ones have familiar traits- lousy pasts, lousy habits, obsession with vengeance, self-justification that borders on delusion. It might be a formula, but just as Monza Murcatto was merely similar to Glokta, so also Shy is somewhat similar to Monza in good ways while diverging in good ways as well.<br /><br />Abercrombie is the first fantasy author I've read to take a serious stab at modernization, and his take on the western expands those efforts. He's frank instead of nostalgic: progress is a specific, palpable thing. Capitalism displaces feudalism. Technology displaces laborers. Standing armies displace mercenaries. The conflict hits all of the major characters, and is essentially the main story conflict. I've written that he has a strange optimism before, but I think &#34;progress&#34; might be a better term for it. Things don't necessarily get better, they progress. That might mean the near-anarchy outside central cities is reduced. It might also mean firearms are developed for warfare. There's an ambivalence without any favored conclusion, and he writes it beautifully.<br /><br />As with the previous &#34;sequels&#34; to the original trilogy, the book fully stands on its own. Reading its predecessors illuminates some of the characters, but it is not necessary to understand what's going on. Suffice to say that when Abercrombie tells you a character has an ugly past, that character is going to have enough of an ugly present that you get the idea without any need for exposition.<br /><br />It's an outstanding and amazing read and I hope to see more.y displaces laborers.

1452126577|5.0|It's a fun book. I always loved \\"Tarder Sauce\\" and her attitude. The book has her history, memes, games and a \\"how to\\" develop a bad attitude. :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The actors were extraordinary in their parts.  Each season has drama that could fit in modern day.  We could all learn how our own decisions affects others.  I would recommend this season to anyone who likes drama.
B0083DJUMA|4.0|This caught me by surprise. The future is already upon us, and I didn't know it. My dentist has one of these 3D printers and made me a new tooth while I sat in his chair. Amazing.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This app is the bomb! I love it. I think that this game is not just for kids! I'm a grown woman and my kids play this with me. I recommend it to everyone. Thank you disney! We love the movie and now the game! :D
B0034G4P26|5.0|This video is wonderful.  Where to begin.  It is very, very funny and you have to watch it several times to catch all the gags and read all the signs--it is worth it. The animation is spectacular, so be sure to watch the Special Features to see how they do it--you will be amazed.  The story is clever, and the actors do a great job.  A treat for all ages
0439023491|5.0|This sequel is as good as or maybe slightly better than the Hunger Games. Of course, I am reading these books between movies. I did not read this until I'd seen the Hunger Games, so while I am reading it is easier to picture the actors from the movie. I really enjoyed it and can't wait to read Mockingjay - but will wait until after seeing the movie for this one, of course. I think I will be sad when I finish this trilogy...that it is over.
B003O7I6L6|2.0|Those two stars are simply there because this is a five star movie.  Don't expect any deep social messages (there are social messages, but you don't need to be a literary student to figure them out; I'd say you don't even need to be educated past the sixth grade).  What this movie has is atmosphere to draw you in, character's to keep you interested, and a story to make you want to see the finish.  I love this movie as well as the remake...I mean sequel \\"Escape From LA.\\"<br />Why only two stars?  Because I've bought this movie a number of times now, whether it has been on VHS, DVD, or now Blu-Ray.  Which version should be the best?  The Blu-Ray.  It came out in 2010, so it's the most recent.  It has the best technology behind it.  Instead, what we get is a barebones mess that makes me picture MGM executives spitting in every case as it comes off the manufacturing line.  In 2003, a deluxe edition came out which featured the deleted opening scene, a retrospective featurette, two audio commentaries, and a bunch of little other extras.  How much of this got ported over seven years later?  NONE!  Not even the commentaries, which, if you are a John Carpenter fan, you know are always very entertaining.  The biggest feature you get is audio in French!  WTH, MGM?  Essentially, this Blu-Ray disc is more than half empty!  It could've been a mini Blu-ray.  The deluxe edition is even done in a High Def transfer, so if you put the DVD version into your Blu-Ray player, you're getting the same quality as the Blu-Ray!  Do Not Purchase this load of excrement that MGM put out to make a dollar on cult film fans.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app! I have a Google Nexus 7 tablet and find that the books available through the Google store are severely limited. But now I can access all of the great deals on Amazon for Kindle.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The game keeps you busy and exercises your brain.  I just do not like the up extra loaded junk that come with the free game. They confuse the kids and they wind up klicking on them.
B004W4N55C|4.0|Great transposing flexibility,  but need to be able to be able to email or text the transposed version. I would give it 5 stars if the program had this feature.
B005HSL626|5.0|The games keeps you occupied. I just do not like the up extra loaded junk that come with the free game. They confuse the kids and they wind up klicking on them.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is amazing a friend of mines little girl showed me this game and I thought it was amazing. I have never seen a game that resembled taking care of a horse so well. I love this game. If I could have a real live horse it would be a dream come true. But alas life doesn't always work out that way. And this is as near of owning a horse as a person can get.
0321934946|5.0|Absolutely great book and every photographer below professional should have a copy.<br />Excellent explanations in simple language with easy to follow tips and guides. The book is worth every penny.<br />Makes you want to dash out and do the projects.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|Easy to use. Full features.Same as my regular Gmail account. Well worth the 0.99 cent investment.<br />Would definitely recommend.<br />Great app.
B008QPCCQQ|5.0|I love Louisa May Alcott's writings and to find this many works together for such a great price is amazing!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|A must see before you see reds 2 also a good movie. No issues with prime, watching the movie or the payment process.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Love Love Love NCIS!<br />Wish I could give it 10 Stars... Been waiting to see this episode after the cliff hanger of the explosion & Ducky on the beach.So glad everyone survived.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|I was really surprised by this book. It has some bad language it gets the point through. I would recommend the book to many.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Overall this is a great book if you are looking to appreciate the mindset of people who love to run.<br /><br />The author is able to use the stories of ultra-marathoners to give an in-depth physical and mental picture of the ability of humans to run.<br /><br />Going beyond the ultra-marathoner stories is a side story into the research being done into the evolutionary advantages that humans have because of the ability to run. This side story could really change how you think about yourself physically and mentally.<br /><br />Sometimes the book lapses too close in tone to a 'Runners World' magazine article. This flaw can be forgiven due to the interesting introduction that this author is able to give into the innate and evolved ability of modern humans to run.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I wish I had not updated this.  Terrible to use now on Kindle.  Just like updating so many apps.  Leave well enough alone.  Sooo annoyed.
140006922X|5.0|Well written and extensively researched. I enjoyed reading this book! Some of the negative reviews leave me wondering if the writers actually read the book or if they merely watched Fox News' embarrassing (for Fox News) interview with the author.
B00CU8OVIM|3.0|1-I believe this is the CD we J. Cole fans wanted the fist time.  I have no problem with the disc.<br /><br />2-My major complaint and it's gigantic to me is that I ordered the CD to be delivered on the release date to me.  At the last minute it was noted I wouldn't be receiving until a day later.  Tremendous disappointment.  Delivery and fulfillment let me down, I could have gotten the product from a brick and mortar instead.  Major foul up.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I love all the songs on this album by Adele. I regularly purchase music here on amazon. Appreciate the selection
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Such and imagination and such a way with words..I'm totally addicted. Just wish you could publish more..and faster.  Everything else seems boring. Thank you so much!!
B009U9S6FI|4.0|First part is great, second part becomes somewhat theoretical perhaps due to the fact that Victor Frankl himself was a psychotherapist. But the theory gets supported by some great examples which makes it easy to read through.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|Make 'em Laugh has got to be one of the greatest slapstick moments in the history of musical comedy. I love Gene Kelly, but Donald O'Conner is the unsung hero if the film!
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Best year yet! Cant wait to see the upcoming season. Will watch as long as the series in on.. okay
B001NA6096|5.0|Bought it for my wife to enjoy but I sorta fell into it too.  Everyone else seems to recommend it, so what else can I possible add.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun happy, different. At times really irritating because there is no instructions or  ,hint button but sometimes that is half the fun!
B00275EHJQ|5.0|I can't believe I got it at this price. And for Blu ray? My daughter was thrilled when we bought it and its a great buy at a great price.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Even though I am a big fan of Pinterest on my computer, it was so much fun on my Kindle!  Time passed very quickly.  It is mostly set up the way it is on the regular internet site however, I still haven't found a button to sign out of the app.  That is the only thing I can say wrong about this app.  It is so much fun doing Pinterest this way.  So glad I downloaded it to my Kindle.  I highly recommend it.!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Great continuation of the story. It is a fantasy tale about life and growing up, punctuated with adventure. Pages 800 to 900 begin to drone on but it is hardly noticeable. Looking forward to seeing what happens next. To Rothfuss, please continue to take your time, I love the heart you put into your story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My daughter loves this game! I never thought battery life would be an issue but before I know it she gives me the kindle saying it's dead!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Got this game for my 6 year old but I had to get it for myself too!  Very fun and addictive!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I've have been playing this game for years, and I still, never get bored. Great game.  I would recommend this. Game to everyone, it is truly relaxing.
B000NMY7CM|5.0|I watched this movie for a college class on group therapy. Thinking it might be boring but trying to stay open minded I watched it. This is an excellent movie, it has humor, believable real-life situations, and drama. This movie really takes an up-close personal look at 28 days of rehabilitation in a way that changes one's perspective. This is a must see for anyone who enjoys a good movie and highly recommended for those individuals taking Psychology courses, Chemical Dependency Courses, or any group therapy related courses. Glad to find it here I checked other movie accounts that I have and only Amazon had this available.<br />Thank You Amazon!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Ordered they day it come out, used my Prime, with next day shipping.  Easy to setup using my HP chromebook, and was \\"casting\\" within minutes.  The second evening we had a youtube music video party with 3 android phones and 2 folks with iphones, we were able to keep the chromecast hopping..  very cool how all the devices seemed to work together.  Only issue we found was that the iphones couldn't add videos to the \\"tv querry\\", but all others could.  play on one device, and pause or skip from another.  You can even control the video volume via your phone.<br />a few cool features that we actually used.<br /><br />1.  if you use the provdied power supply, the TV can be off, and you can cast to it, the TV comes on all by itself.<br />2.  the box comes with an HDMI extender to fit TV's with tight spaces, and it also improves the wifi connection.<br />3.  google music works quite well.<br />4.  Browser casting doesn't work well for streaming sites, at least not on our network.  hopefully amazon, hulu, and others will get on it soon.<br /><br />Have fun, totally worth the money.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Was sad to get to the end.  Looking forward to a new version.  Hope the wait won't be too long.  Thanks.  Was mentally entertaining and visually pleasing.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Did hold your interest but seemed to drag out a bit.  Found if difficult that mother did not convey concern she had about Jacob to his dad.
B00407PNY2|5.0|Bought this for my son.  He likes Mustangs and a good car chase movie.  Met both expectations!!  Wish they made movies like they used to.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|fun game to pass the time. woo who . fun fun good times fun for all ages yea sweet. good graphics tons of cool gems
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This game is sweet, lots of fun and thus the love. It is so addicting that before you know it, hours have gone by and thus the hate.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This was a great story until the ending...I was sooooooo diasappointed. Just to give you a heads up! It was a page turner and then it was over!
B00BESM14U|5.0|Fantastic coming of age story. Makes me want to read the book because the movie was so good, so the book must be wonderful.
B0092S4WLY|2.0|Don't play this one. Can You Escape is so much better. The graphic is better and the game play is more fun.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Mile 81 wasn't a long book but it packed a lot of action inside of it. I would definitely recommend this book as a good read.
B00BMUVW5O|5.0|Another fantastic book from James and Bob.  A real life adventure.  Well written and thought provoking.  Take the time to read this heartwarming true story!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I wish it was like pc and xbox, its a fun app. All you do is build and build and you should get that app.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I have read a number of books on religion but this one helps to put those others in a better perspective. It is very difficult to believe anything in the bible from a historical point of view but this book helps a great deal to clear up the mystery of the man ,Jesus.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Well its already outlasted my friends razer headset so it has good sound deep bass and i cant ask for a better headset
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is perfection in every way.  I can watch every episode over and over.  Beautiful settings for superb actors to tell us exquisite stories.  Particularly endearing is the fact that so gifted a family endures so many terrible trials.  The poor and well to do suffer equally...and need each other equally as well.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book describe the life of a child who experiences hard times. Even though his trails aren't the same as others, a reader can still relate to the protagonist in more was than one. This is a novel that you can't put down till you read the end.
B000FA675C|5.0|Once again, Dan Brown has written a novel I couldn't put down until I was done with it. I know he has his critics, but if you keep in mind that this is a work of fiction, I think you will enjoy it.
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|As an academic scientist who studies prosociality, I highly recommend this book for demonstrating how giving can be a highly successful strategy in workplace settings. The idea that selfishness is required to succeed, much as we might wish otherwise, is a toxic narrative that causes people to act against their own and everyone else's interest. Of course giving is vulnerable to exploitation, but this danger is exaggerated and there are many ways for people employing giving strategies to protect themselves from people employing taking strategies, especially when norms and institutional arrangements can be brought into play. Although there are temperamental differences in one's tendency to give and take, to a large degree it is anyone's strategic choice. And giving and self-advancement can go together.<br /><br />The author reviews a management literature that was largely unfamiliar to me and a psychology and game theory literature that was more familiar. The evolutionary literature was under-referenced, but it is highly supportive of the basic thesis.<br /><br />Finally, the book was a pleasure to read, combining entertaining stories of people with scientific studies that are well referenced at the end. I hope that it is widely read and contributes to a new narrative that will make the workplace more humane and productive at the same time.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|Wireless is simply better. Now that is out the way, this headset is great. It might get a little hot or uncomfortable after wearing it for a very long time but honestly its just part of the style of ear cup/headset there is no way around it.
B001EN71CW|5.0|That's it, I endorse this product. They should NOT have cancel it, specially when the actors were willing to reprise their roles.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This game is more interesting than most.  The puzzles are better and fun.  You have to think a bit on these and can't just jump ahead with the same old game.  Have fun.
0345803450|5.0|SWEET TOOTH is the fourth Ian McEwan novel for me, picked up because I find his writing extraordinary.  Each phrase, sentence, paragraph seems as finely worked as folds in a Bernini sculpture or tones in a Rembrandt oil.  What is it about the British?  Why do they seemingly have the best turn of phrase at every moment?  McEwan is masterful in alliterative phrases, adjectival descriptors, paragraph pacing, in short -- scene-setting.<br /><br />SWEET TOOTH is written in the first person, as the memoir of protagonist Serena Froome.  Serena describes her childhood, her education, and the novel takes off with the early days of her career in the famed British Secret Service, MI5.  A boon to this book is McEwan's detailed descriptions of just how bad Britain was during the 1970s.  While Americans often think of Watergate, gas lines, rising interest rates and a hostage crisis, the Brits faced a near collapse of their society.  A broken economy, crippling industry strikes, IRA terrorism, and ever-creeping socialism.  McEwan takes us back to a London that was filthy, unsafe, and generally dank and gloomy.  Between McEwan's Cambridgian academics and intelligence wonks, we get a good dose of British politics in the pre-punk, pre-Thatcher days, and a reminder of gender inequity in the professional world.<br /><br />The tale involves our young heroine's dalliances with a number of gentlemen, and an unusual intelligence assignment, codename:\\"Sweet Tooth,\\" involving a writer.  What a device!  Here writer McEwan crafts a number of story-inside-the-stories.  Again, he drops the reader into a highly visual, well-defined and interesting tale, not once, but multiple times.  As the novel closes in on end-page 301, Serena's story weaves several puzzling loose ends together in a typically clever narrative from this author.  If you are a McEwan fan, as am I, you'll enjoy indulging your SWEET TOOTH.
0393314804|5.0|You will laugh, think, want to cry, and want to look away, but you will not be able to stop reading. Youth/drug culture is merely the canvas upon which Welsh paints this masterpiece of Thatcherite Scotland (which, by the way, you don't have to know anything about going in to appreciate). I would give it 7 stars if I could.
0385349947|5.0|This book is packed full of ideas and points that you will reference for a long time after reading the book.  This book was enlightening and great to help you think about things you never would have considered.  Highly recommend.
B00847KFDS|5.0|I love talented people playing great songs. I had listened to old CCR songs until I knew every note. This album is almost the same as a &#34;live&#34; album of the old songs. Everything is extremely familiar, but freshened up enough to feel new.
B009AMANBA|5.0|We saw this movie on opening night, and I enjoyed it so very much that I had to purchase it so that we will be able to watch it again and loan it to close family members.
B003VANOFY|2.0|The headset has perfect sound.  However, I am hearing impaired and must wear hearing aids.  The headset goes over the hearing aids, nicely.  However, the headset turns itself off, randomly.  Apparently (User community board), the problem has been known to Logitec for two years and they ignore it.  I've been waiting for a fix for over two months and now the return time has expired.<br />FIND ANOTHER PRODUCT.  DON'T BUY THIS ONE ! ! !
B006TF6WAM|4.0|Slow burner but really enjoyed it the further I got into it. Harold becomes more likeable as he travels and its a touching story about a couple torn apart by grief. Highly recommend it.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|These books got me back into reading this year.  What a fantastic writing style.  I would highly recommend, great read even if you don't like fantasy.
B005544TRQ|5.0|My first tv show on my kindle fire. Wow. Great picture and audio. And I really liked Suits and will continue to download more episodes.
B0091REZMW|1.0|Not really free. If you want to advance you have to pay. Also very blurry w/ close ups no matter what device you use.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Well written historical fiction.  Characters were true to the period. Story line held my interest and I will be looking for other books by this author.
B000I3W1XS|5.0|how logical and intelligent.  The growth progression was interesting too.  I had to &#34;buy&#34; this episodes whereas all the other movies were free on Prime.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The app updated a couple of weeks ago and hasn't worked since, big disappointment.  I'll also say that even when it did work, the text was too small (no way to adjust in settings), an  the pictures show up way to large in proportion to everything else, making it difficult to eve know what you're looking at.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Simply put its a series about the Crowley family from 1912 till???<br />We see how the English royalty live, think and behave.<br />I didn't think I would like it, but I found it fascinating and addictive.<br />The characters are interesting and believable, the acting excellent<br />Try it for yourselves, and i'm sure you will agree.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Another hit to go along with your other series of The Birds. This one and others are great as my grandson and I like to compete against each other to try and set a higher score.
B008Y768XO|4.0|This is a sweet movie about a great dog.  There isn't too much that happens in the story- the dog really carries it.  Richard Gere is good, too.  It would have been nice if the story had been kept in Japan, or at least answered the question of who Hachi was intended for.  It remained very odd that no one ever looked for him. But if you look past that, this would make a good movie to watch in a relaxed mood while knitting or doing paperwork.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is like subway surfers but more fun I love it and I think everyone should get it because it is so fun!!!!!!
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Movie needed to be edited, condensed. Acting good...love Dench and  Craig. The new Q was good also, and the bad guy up to the part. But I was weary of movie long before the end
B004IV5AKM|5.0|WATCH THIS MOVIE, you WON'T be dissapointed, it actually inspired me to become a film maker! Everything is fantastic. I LOVE ED WOOD
B005FQ2H8W|4.0|A strange, but engaging read.<br />I have familymembers who worked in one of the American shipyards during WWII and they had heard stories, back then that something explosively peculiar had happened at the Philadelphia ship-yards.<br />Wonderful, &#34;Gee-Whiz!&#34; reading for summer gatherings and discussions at the lake cabin.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book does an excellent job of separating what is known from what is merely surmised and places each element in the appropriate historical context, rather than trying to separate action and event from that context and evaluating it through a modern perspective.  A really fantastic read, with excellent documentation.
B008HJGPVO|3.0|I like the stylus because it's more accurate than my fingers when texting.  I just wish that it also made it easier to write.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo Blitz is fast moving and never lags unlike other bingo games (Z).  The daily tournament is free and you can win lots of powerups
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|Great condition and delivery.  Wasn't able to finish watching this with my son when it was on television one day...boy was he surprised when he received this in the mail.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Have seen it twice, love it. The effects are great and the inteaction between characters was well done. The &#34;flying aircraft carrier&#34; was a bit over the top but that was taken right from the comics. I thought Robert Downey Jr stole the show as Ironman but all were very good.
1781162646|5.0|One of Stephen King's milder books, but I still thoroughly enjoyed reading it as a summer read while on vacation.
B0096HL33G|1.0|The movie story line was terrible and not likely to happen. I didn't like it at all... The streaming quality was good.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|time consuming but worth it. wish pearls were easier to get and there were ways besides waiting three days or purchasing them.
B005MHI0QM|5.0|Finally able to read this.  I read the original version and always felt as if something was missing.  Now the book is complete.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|This scanner is so easy to use!  I scanned over 500 slides in one day.  One click and it is done!  The one problem I had it that some of my slides had larger frames and were hard to get in and out.  Keeping a pair of tweezers handy solved that problem.  Overall I would recommend this to others.

B008AK8FHM|3.0|A lot of the book dwelt on the author's past growing up.  I had to get through that to get to the experiences mentioned in the title.  I understand the difficulty in explaining what he saw in terms we could understand.  But it took a lot of reading to get there.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The settings are amazing and the character development is exceptional. Addictive and a must see. I eagerly await season four.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|This was such an interesting read for me, and it left me with many complex feelings. So I apologize in advance if this review rambles as I try to explain my reaction to it.<br /><br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower reminded me so much of a book I grew up with, Catcher in the Rye. It's one of those books that leaves you with such an intense, almost indescribable, feeling that's hard to shake. Unfortunately, that feeling was a hollow emptiness that I felt much more often when I was a teenager. There is nothing wrong with a book that makes you feel what the author probably intended, but from a personal opinion standpoint, I didn't like feeling that way. But this is just a side point. On to the review.<br /><br />The book is beautifully written. The voice is incredibly interesting. In fact the character sounds so much like the protagonist in The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time, that you cannot convince me that Charlie is not high-functioning autistic. I kept waiting for that to be revealed, and it never was. Perhaps it says more about me that the book felt a bit incomplete for never telling us. But it could also mean the author never intended for it to be seen that way, which would NOT be a good thing. In fact, the author goes on to tell us at the end that Charlie is actually gifted. Obviously, a person can be high-functioning autistic and intelligent at the same time. But the fact that the author only revealed the gifted part is a real curiosity for me. Charlie's voice is clearly emotionally immature for his age, as well as being unusually formal. I don't buy that the ultimate reason revealed toward the very last few pages caused this state, so I'm just not sure what to make of it.<br /><br />I thought the evolution of all Charlie's friendships was beautifully done, and the theme was incredibly shown. I am big into themes, and this one did not disappoint. I take some exception to the title itself, as I never for a second thought of Charlie as a wallflower. In fact, I'd say he was an extrovert. The title is very misleading to me.<br /><br />The only other part I didn't care for was the ending. I won't reveal anything here. I just want to say that it felt Scooby Doo-ish to suddenly have Charlie figure it all out and explain it so articulately in the last few pages. I wish that the author had allowed an extra ten pages to slowly evolve Charlie's understanding of what happened, so it would be more in fitting with his character. Instead, I felt like the author was hearing a voice in his head saying, \\"Okay, Chbosky, you've reached the climax of the book. The resolution has to happen quickly now.\\" This is a flaw of many books, and one that I will try to remind myself of as I write my next book, no matter what editors or plot books advise. Especially in a case like this, where the ending is so intriguing and different that we really want to know how it affects the protagonist.<br /><br />So that is why the four stars. This book could not be more artfully written or constructed (ending excepted) and the characters are wonderful. I especially recommend this book for anyone who writes for young adults.r.

B007SZ0E1K|2.0|Okay, I'm a veteran for shopping on amazon. And I personally think that amazon overcharged for this processor. I went to Microcenter and got the same processor for $189.00 on sale. I don't understand why amazon placed a high price on this but that's my opinion. But hey, I upgraded from a i3 to a i5 for Virtualization and my i3 was more like a \\"temporary\\" processor. But ill keep the i3 as a spare, always good to have a spare CPU. 2/5 for overpricing, and I'm not trying to be negative about it but 5/5 for the processor overall.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|Did not meet expectations. All of the prior movies were better. Some good action scenes but all and all a yawn.

B005LAIIQC|4.0|I think this movie may not actually appeal to people who really enjoyed the prior films. I happened not to like those primarily because Jason Bourne was a bit more of a macho character. If you come to this movie expecting that... you may be disappointed.  This movie takes off with a bit of an older / wiser / more human lead character caught up in the CIA game. Aaron Cross. Aaron was in the army and presumably killed, but really went to CIA and became an agent. The movie starts a bit slow but I think it was necessary to telling a new story. The twist here is that Aaron was not exactly bright prior to joining the CIA. He is a hero that has been largely created via medical science -- given medication that made him smarter and more physically capable. There is a humanity to Aaron Cross that was missing with Jason Bourne. Aaron kills people for sure but you get the feeling he would have better judgment than Bourne. I believe it is also suggested that Aaron's fellow agents in a program called \\"Outcome\\" are trained to be more human than the typical CIA killer.<br /><br />The movie starts as the CIA is in complete crisis mode as the events surrounding the first three Bourne movies convince the CIA that they have to kill all the current tredstone or treadstone like agents to cover their tracks. They kill a lot of them but Aaron manages to survive and realizes what is happening. Aaron has one large problem though he is out of medications. He goes after the doctor who has been treating him in the program... Dr. Marta Shearing who is currently being targeted as well. They both go on the run and try to get the treatment that will allow Aaron not to be dependent on the medications.<br /><br />Clearly Marta is the love interest but the good news is that any romance was largely pushed off to future movies. They largely suggest that Aaron has a bit of a crush on Marta and she may have liked him too. But in this movie they are just friends that need each other.  They have bigger concerns the entire movie. I found the chase scenes interesting and intense and I think the soundtrack helps a lot with that.<br /><br />For me it was quite the surprise and I was glad I watched it. I didn't go in hoping to see something like the prior films and I was happily surprised.

B004J4WN0I|4.0|There are far too few books looking into the celtic side of magical myths so this is a welcome addition to my fantasy library.  Also the cheeky humor of the main character keeps me drawn into reading, plus it's not a difficult read in the slightest.

I am now un-installing what used to be a fantastic app.  How an app could go so far backwards in an update is mind boggling.  I hope The Weather Channel takes note!

B0049J0CTM|1.0|Although Finding Nemo is a delightful video, the quality of this was horrible! It stopped, and re-loaded about 10 times. We lost the picture, but had the sound part of the time. I gaven't had so much trouble with an Amazon Video before....truly disappointing, especially for my 3 year old grandson!
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Excellent book. David Baldacci never fails to entertain and keep us on the edge of our seats for the entire story.

B008602KQI|5.0|This was an Excellent video.  The story held fairly close to the novel.  The only obvious deviances came from Katniss receiving the gift of the mockingjay pin, and Gale's jealousy merely being hinted at.  I'd definitely recommend the video to others.

I have contacted customer service several times to have my original profile merged with the temporary one and have still not had any responses session from them. I enjoyed  play in  the game but I guess it will be a lesson learned to stay away from all Disney games in the future since they obviously don't care about their customers.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this game one star was because  I had to. I wanted to give it ZERO!

B008JFUO0Y|5.0|As far as 21st century horror movies go....this is awesome. Yes it takes a lot of it's material from the original...but if you a fan of the original do you really want to see anything else? It's pretty bloody, but at least humanity comes out on top.
140006922X|5.0|Resa has given us a gift.  Reading the gospels and appreciating the substantial differences between them indicate to me that these writers each had an agenda as well as a story to tell.  The story of Jesus that Resa portrays is one based on what was going on at that time and the people who experienced life then in Roman Palestine.  I've learned so much about early Judaism, the Romans and the culture of the people who lived then.  I'm half way through the book and can't put it down. I highly recommend it.

B00DHNBPA6|1.0|Typical remake.  Not even half as good as the original.  Bruce Campbell has a lot of explaining to do for promoting this movie.  He must have been possessed by a big paycheck.  STAY AWAY.
B00CL50KDY|2.0|I don't know why I thought this was going to be a good movie.  I guess someone from the younger generation would find this movie appealing, but if you're looking for some serious zombie horror action, don't buy or rent this film. Wait for it on HBO.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Saw the monie in the theatre and loved it . Maggie smith and the rest of the cast are excellent. Had to own  it
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|I actually like Tom Cruise and up til now have never seen him do a bad movie. Not all of them were great but none were truly awful. Jack Reacher is an awful, awful movie. The writing is terrible, the plot is incomprehensible, the acting was terrible and cheesy, and I want those two hours of my life back. Not one thing about this movie makes any kind of sense. It had potential but then it just went nowhere fast. The \\"mystery\\" of the crime is idiotic and is never explained. There's this villain that is somehow so bad no one can even look at him but his motivation is ridiculous. It basically comes down to \\"We take. That's what we do.\\" Except we're supposed to believe there's this huge conspiracy going on. My brain hurts. I'm ashamed of both Tom Cruise and Robert Duvall, both of whom must have lost a bet.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I enjoy playing. this game. my 3 year old isn't to interested in it. I think if he was a little more patience he like it

0307352153|4.0|This book was recommended to me after I interviewed for an Executive Director position and realized that I would be working with a  senior management group that most dominated by introverts.  I am a Myers-Briggs ENTJ and was asked by the panel how I would handle working with introverts.  I gave an acceptable answer but realized that I should probable think about this a little deeper.  A friend had watched Susan Cain's TED talk and recommended Quiet.  I was hooked by the introduction and found it to be engaging, enlightening and an all around good read. Really changed my outlook.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|The game was too short, but a good game nonetheless. It is a fun and very challenging game. If more levels were added it would be even better!
B008NW67E0|5.0|The acid test for any music, for me in the end, is how it makes me feel. The stuff I repeatedly listen to transports me to a higher place and touches me at the soul level--the kind of music that creates its own atmosphere, grabs my attention and won't let go. And that kind of music is rare these days. Mumford is one of those rare bands that grabs on and pulls me in to a place where I experience a depth of sound and voice that interact and result in a transcendence that lifts the spirit. Cannot recommend more highly.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I played around with the Chromecast for a day and it works very well. Setup was quick and straightforward. YouTube and Netflix played nearly flawlessly. I was able to cast videos to the Chromecast using my iPhone, Macbook Air, and an Android tablet. I could switch among the different devices and the Chromecast will play the selected video on whichever device I was using without delay. I could not find how to queue videos on my Macbook Air, but I found the TV queue on the YouTube app of my iPhone and Android tablet.<br /><br />I will mention some of the issues I noticed when using the Chromecast. On rare occasions, when I changed the YouTube video being played, the video would not play on the Chromecast but the audio would still play. Refreshing the video on the device I was using would fix that problem. I didn't play around on Netflix long enough to see this problem occur. Private videos on my YouTube account will not play at all on the Chromecast. I'm assuming it's because the Chromecast does not have permission to access my private videos. Unlisted and public videos will play fine. Casting a Chrome tab on my Macbook Air would result in a laggy and blurry display of the tab on the Chromecast. The text was unreadable and scrolling on a website was delayed by a second. I also found no way to set permissions on which devices can cast a video to the Chromecast. I can see that being a problem on a public WiFi or a shared WiFi with the Chromecast.<br /><br />Buy the Chromecast for YouTube and Netflix. Don't buy it if you want to mirror your Chrome browser tabs.<br /><br />Update: I got my Netflix 3 month code on July 30, 2013 and after I used it, a discount of $23.97 was applied to my Netflix account. Awesome!

B004V7EXO2|2.0|I don't think Paul Simon has ever made, or at-least released, a beautiful album. He's made plenty of beautiful songs though, which made for a steady stream of albums that were at-least good. That was until a little over a decade ago when, after the release of Songs From The Capeman, perhaps his most melodic set, the quality of his music suddenly declined. He's been stuck in an artistic rut ever since. This new album, only his third in all that time, is no return to form.<br /><br />The first song; a Christmas anthem, oddly enough; suggests it might be. It's better than every song on his last album and most of the songs on the One before it. But So Beautiful Or So What is a wonderless mess from there; all the way to the title song, which is barely good enough. Most of this set, all but the first and last song, is a drag. The poetry and storytelling is vintage Paul Simon, but the vocal melodies, an element the artist used to master, are boring and bland.<br /><br />Brian Eno is replaced by the long-awaited return of Phil Ramone as producer, but his work offers little help. What these songs needed were to be scrapped for better songs, \\"simple\\" ones, as Paul Simon himself described during a Barnes And Noble interview in 2008. He played demo versions of Love And Hard Times and Questions For The Angels that day, music he described as \\"complex\\", before strumming an experimental groove he described as going back to something \\"simple\\".<br /><br />That groove was loopy, bouncy and instantly catchy. It didn't need drums or even vocals to sound marvelous and I hoped he'd make a full song out of it for this album, but it's nowhere to be found. In its place are songs it takes repeated listens to even grasp the forgettable melodies of. The whiny guitar riffs on Love And Blessings are funky, yes, but it's not nearly enough. I want a beautiful Paul Simon album, or at-least another good one, before he's dead and gone.<br /><br />marcellee.com

If you are lucky enough to place your quarter in the right place, you can cause an avalanche of money to fall into your bucket or whatever you are using to catch them in.  They even tempt you with folded up $5 and $20 bills folded up.  Of course the money you win on this version is virtual, it's just as fun.

B00908DDZM|5.0|I bought this album based on some singles of I had heard from Macklemore, specifically Thrift Shop, Can't Hold Us, Wings, and Same Love. The rest of the album lives up to the stregth of the singles. Macklemore is witty and cocky when he wants to be, and heartfelt and sincere when appropriate. Starting Over and Jimmy Lovine are two of my favorites. Macklemore is my favorite Rapper since Eminem.

B0099RFVXQ|5.0|My kids, ages 13, 11, 6, and 5 loved it! My youngest boy wore his Thor costume while watching. Lots of action so it keeps their attention!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't usually read books like this I usually read book more along the line of the Immortal Instruments. So when I read this book I didn't really expect to enjoy it that much I just needed to read it for my summer reading. I had read a few reviews for the Fault in Our Stars before reading the actual book and I thought oh it's just another live story type thing (like dear John, The Notebook) but it was so much more then a love story. I found myself actually in Hazel's shoes experiencing everything as if I was Hazel herself. By the time the I finished the book I had laughed, felt true love, guilty for having eyes, crying my eyes out, and most of all I felt pure pleasure in saying I found my Imperial Affliction. I promise this book is no let down! I will more than likely read this book over and over again.
B006N9XHLQ|4.0|I have read many of Josh's books and will continue.  Good story line and character development and an easy, enjoyable read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very entertaining. Great way to waste some time. Better when using a stylus. It can be addicting if you are not careful.
B002LANLDK|4.0|Just a simple movie, like all the others. No need to think or plow deeply into the movie. Just watch and enjoy.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Book 3 seemed a little slower than books 1 and 2, but I still enjoyed it very much. You have to read these books. I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B0018OFN2W|4.0|Just a simple movie, like all the others. No need to think or plow deeply into the movie. Just watch and enjoy.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Back in April I started watching the on demand version of the HBO series Game of Thrones. I started watching on a whim because nothing else was on. I got totally hooked on the series and would watch several episodes at a time. I finally decided to start reading the books. I am really enjoying this series of books. I started reading book 1 sometime in May, I think, and I'm now on book 4. I'm absolutely hooked! The book has everything to keep me entertained. It has mystery, fantasy, comedy, action, war, love...everything! I especially like the character Tyrion. I haven't actually started reading book 4 because I'm trying to pace myself because after book 5 that's it...the author hasn't finished the final two books. Also, I purchased each book separately instead of the 4 book box set, mainly because I wasn't sure if I wanted to commit to all 4 books. Anyway, now I'm kind of hoping that when books 6 and 7 are released that maybe Amazon will offer books 5-7 as a set. that's another reason I'm trying to pace myself.<br /><br />This is a really creative series of books. I haven't read anything like it before and I highly recommend the books.
B005TBWN0K|4.0|still learning how to use skitch but so far its helped me out with my homeschool projects while connecting to evernote.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|See my book 1 review. The books are great so far. on book 4 now. Lots of twists and turns in book 2. The setting created by George Martin is amazing! Fantasy at it's best.
B009NY43NY|3.0|For the final book of the series, I was disappointed. Its a quick read like the rest, but lacks a lot of the characters and story line that I enjoyed reading about in previous books. Good to finish the series, but I wouldn't rush out to buy it.
193700788X|4.0|So as an &#34;end&#34; to the Sookie novels this one comes in as Meh. It's still very well written in that it's funny and detailed but there really isn't much of a plot or a &#34;closure&#34; for this being the last novel of the series. I feel that maybe Mrs. Harris just got tired of expounding on Sookie and crammed this novel together to be done with it. I would also hate to think that there will be many multiple short stories to follow up with this book because I don't know about you but I'm darn tired of having to buy multiple short story collections that usually only have one or two good short stories in them in order to find out Sookie plot points. Mrs. Harris, you need to be done with Sookie and move on.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Tangled by Emma Chase<br />5 Stars!<br />\\"Most men can't multitask. It's true. That' why you won't catch many guys trying to make a full-course Thanksgiving dinner.\\"<br />There are hero POV books and then there is this book - I LOVED it.<br />Drew Evans is quite comfortable in his life.  He works hard and enjoys his free time on his own terms, no connections, no ties to any women.  Then one night in a bar he is mesmerized by the \\"endlessly dark\\" eyes he sees at a bar, and for the first time in his life when he turns on the charm he goes home alone and without her name. On Monday, Drew's father introduces the firm to the new associate, Katherine Brooks.  Drew now knows the beautiful woman's name.<br />Tangled is a romance told by the hero's point of view.  Maybe calling Drew a hero gives the wrong impression, Drew does not do anything heroic in this book - well unless you count the fact that I was laughing throughout most of the book heroic. Not only is this book from Drew's pure male point of view - but he takes the time to \\"explain\\" things to the reader.  Remember the movie \\"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\\", Ferris would stop a scene and talk to the audience - that is exactly what Drew would do. Sometimes he was letting you know something about himself, sometimes he was funny, and sometimes irreverent, but you always know how Drew thinks.<br />\\"I once heard my mother tell my father that she shouldn't have to explain why she was pissed. That if she didn't already know what he'd done wrong, then he wasn't really sorry for it. What the #$@ does that even mean? Newsflash, ladies; We can't read your thoughts. And frankly, I'm not entirely sure I'd want to. The female mind is a scary place to be.\\"<br />The plot of this book is simple, nothing complex and really no real surprises.  I enjoyed the character interaction and dialog. The comedy of some scenes reminded me of \\"I Love Lucy\\"; especially the scene at the table Thanksgiving Day.  This book is good, and my 5 star review does not mean this book will change your life, impact the world or be the topic of a book club, the 5 star review says it's a book that entertained me, that I enjoyed and I can recommend without reservation.<br />I purchased this book after a bunch of friends raved about it - go download it now for when you need a good laugh or a mindless beach read this summer!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Very very very disappointed in the end, she taking it to long for it to end and but I like it.
B008NABUU8|5.0|Awesome game , if you like physics games this is the one to get in my opinion tough I'll admit I haven't played that many. Very good graphics as well!<br />I only wish it didn't drain the battery that much but it's understandable
0525953728|5.0|One of the best SEAL books I have ever read, I have reviewed the one star reviews to be objective and fair but found nothing but pure personal bias against the author or the SEAL teams.  That is not the point of these reviews, and that is why I am telling anyone who is wondering if any of the lower reviews have anything to say and I say don't give those people any of your time.  If you are looking for a story about courage, honor and sacrifice then you will love this book.  The author writes to set the record straight for the world for an event that is so well known, and as usual you can't trust the media to get anything right.  But this story is awesome, inspiring and holds you at your very edge till the moment you read about Bin Laden's death.  A very good companion read is Lone Suvivor which brings you into the world of the SEALS and helps understand and get a sense of just how tough and good they are.  I suggest reading Lone Suvivor first then this one, this way you get to digest the story and it makes perfect sense.  It's not a hard read at all but just a fun and awesome filled adventure.  May God bless and grant eternal rest to all those who serve and give their lives in the name of freedom.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|The quality of this episode was great. I did not have any glitches or interruptions. Thanks for having the season finale.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|A very nice game.  Graphics were ok. Some of the puzzles were very easy. What I liked was you could play it and it didnt require too much effort. It was challenging just the right way. My only problem with it it was bit too short hence only 4 stars.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great weather app on my Android tablet.  My favorite part is the widget I use on my home screen!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|It a good game, especially since its free. My grand babies would like this one, their only four years old, their twins might have a problem sharing it.
B007P06DOK|5.0|If you need some music that will set your feet to tapping and your heart to pumping out a rhythm that is sheer joy, this is the CD for you.
B00CL66FEQ|4.0|I personally thought this was a rather funny movie.  It's been a long time since I've seen Barbara in any sort of movie.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Before I took my trip to Gettysburg I wanted a refresher on the battle so I could appreciate and understand what I would be seeing. This movie held close to the storyline of the book &#34;Killer Angels.&#34;  The musical score gave me chills throughout the movie.  A must see is the Special Featues at the end of the movie where the director and actors shared their thoughts on making the movie. The actors took their parts very seriously and honored the individuals they represented with great performances.  When I took my trip and walked through the battlefields at Gettysburg, I had a profound appreciation of the sacrifices made by the men on both sides.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|Sci-fi that involves Cruise or Travolta can be suspicious at times, but I thought this movie was worth watching.  I paid full price to get it here on AMZ, but it's better than sitting in a theater with noisy dolts.  The non-main characters are flat and quiet, but at 2 hours, there wasn't much time to get other characters yapping as well.<br /><br />I love disaster movies and often think that earth would be better off without us, some of what I saw in this film reminded me of personal ideas and it's nice to see them out there in parallel.  Some reviews said that this movie was confusing and it had me wondering if the movie critic had any good brain cells left. If you want confusing double up on Inception and 12 Monkeys. Oblivion is fine, but it's not Memento or Butterfly Effect for worthy plot twists.<br /><br />Don't look for a super tight story line, and I'm sure you'll find the same holes in the story that I did.  Some things can be explained if you just fill in the blanks yourself. For instance the life pod that gets reused for Julia, says \\"Harper\\" on the lid. They got it by going back to a site to reuse it. I'm leaving out the spoiler bits, but you get it. If you pay attention or watch it a few times, you'll fill in the questions. MM
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|We chose the 5 stars because we had no discipline about watching slowly. We never pay to watch any amazon prime, until now.  We watched season one and two 2 or 3 episodes at a time! We thought the casting was very well done. The graphic violence is too much for me visually, so I watch with my hands over my eyes in those scenes, buy it is not a problem for my husband. I definitely would not allow anyone under 16 to watch though.
B008OE05IG|5.0|Loved this movie! It was heartwarming and interesting at the same time. What a fascinating man. I will watch it again.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|One of the greatest games I have played in awhile! So addicting! You don't need the Internet for most of it.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|This is one of my Go-To apps. If I dont know what something is or what it means. I go to wikipedia. You can search for the most random words, things, objects celebrities, movies & more.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This book was great from start to finish.  Kaleb and Sahara were good together. It was good to find out what happened to him that made him the person he was.  This book was completely filled with great scenes. I enjoyed this story immensely. I can't wait to see what happens next.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works Great! What else could you ask for for a free calculator. Comes in really handy too if you have a kindle fire.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is fun why because you can play slot game's and lot of rooms that I did not stop playing for one minute
140006922X|5.0|Refreshing read...I'm more than a bit disturbed from all of the \\"so-called\\" Christians who have decided to judge this distinguished author because of his faith without even reading his book.  He is a scholar.  Read the book.  Then critique.
0062238868|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book, cant say enough great things about Chris Kyle and the debt our nation owes him and his family!
B003MC5N28|4.0|I love the suspension and the excitement of this book. It's one of the best books I have ever read.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|too long, could've wrapped it up in the second book.kept reading, though, to find out who katniss ended up with
B004CES7DM|5.0|Excellent ensemble cast with riveting story and subplots.  Gritty,  raw,  down and dirty,  but somehow you end up routing  for the bad guys hoping that they will complete  the their last grand heist and ride off into the sunset. Affleck  and Renner make believable pals and have good chemistry. Definitely  recommend this film if you enjoy the mafia and gangland genre.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Ahhh, first love. A youth's first love experience is incredible enough but for both teens having their first love experience together...that's magical. And that is exactly my review of this book...magical. I loved it, every part, even when the pages were difficult to read. If the stressors of adolescence and being misunderstood aren't enough, throw bullying, domestic violence, feeling unwanted, and poverty on top of the mix. Eleanor and Park save each other and have a first love experience that they will remember for all of their years.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game ensures that the player learns there is a lot of work involved with owning a horse. There is enough chores mixed in with fun activities to keep the hopeful equestrian engaged and much more convenient than a real horse. Lost a star because it is not easy to come back to after a few days - too easy to forget the required actions.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Great movie for kids. Dr. Seuss is such a classic. Fun for entire family.
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|Absolutely fantanstic CD. Don't be put off by a female fronted band. Lzzy is incredible and has a great voice. This Cd is better than the first one, but that doesn't mean the first one stinks. It's why I bought the Strange Case. Mz Hyde is as creepy as a King Diamond song and Here's to Us is unbelievable. So good!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a quick but challenging game. I loved that I was able to figure out all the rooms without having to resort to a Youtube walk through. There are ten rooms, as soon as more rooms are added I will improve my star rating to a five.
B0050DIWHU|4.0|I appreciated the authors' approach to laying out a career development plan and how to use your social network that is always held in high but typically abstract regard.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|I missed Jet Li being in more of the movie (understanding his retirement from films), but it was nice to see Bruce Willis, Chuck Norris and Arnold Schwarzenegger say each other's classic one-liners.
1476734941|5.0|Actually cuts your appetite on days you can eat normally, some fast days are harder than others but with a little willpower it is all worth it in the end.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful incite into the lives of the aristocracy and their servants pre and post WWI.  Well written and great character development.  Eagerly awaiting next season!!!
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I totally enjoy this game. Graphics are done rightt,  game play and controls are great, and even the retro song fits! I've finished the game and continue to play just to beat myself! It's that fun. I've downloaded new games and still pick this game as my first  choice. I don't know how the devs can top this, but I'll be waiting for the next edition! Great job guys!
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I tried a few other apps but settled on this one. Easy to use, and doesn't try to sell you something else every 30 seconds. I have an 8\\" Coby Kyros Android Tablet. I wish this was available for the B&N Nook.  This also works on SD Mounted Cards if you have one. Good little app and its free. So far, so good!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Excellent read-sad-involved-emotional<br />I wish for one more chapter on the doc his mom and the friend<br />This book wants us to examine our relationships and look inside our selves
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This game took over an hour to download because I had to archive 5 games and uninstall 3 more games to provide enough memory to install it. Once installed, it played the opening intro, then proceeded to DOWNLOAD even more crap. Finally, the game was ready to play! You need to be signed in to Amazon & connected to internet to play so they can sell you updates $ upgrades. I was not going to waste a memory card on a game I have to play at home. Its free but not FREE! Make sure you have lots of memory and a 24/7 internet connection & money in the bank.
140006922X|5.0|From the internationally bestselling author of No god but God comes a fascinating, provocative, and meticulously researched biography that challenges long-held assumptions about the man we know as Jesus of Nazareth.<br /><br />Two thousand years ago, an itinerant Jewish preacher and miracle worker walked across the Galilee, gathering followers to establish what he called the \\"Kingdom of God.\\" The revolutionary movement he launched was so threatening to the established order that he was captured, tortured, and executed as a state criminal.
B00005AQE7|4.0|I purchase this vinyl to add to my collection.  I loved this project when it dropped in the mid-90s but I've lost the CD since then.  The only complaint I have is how the records do not fit well in the jacket.  It's a 4 album set/double jacket with 2 albums fitting in each jacket.  It seems to me the manufacturer should have increased the width of the sleeves. It was hard to get them out and darn near impossible to get them back in,  But the albums play great!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book was so good that I'm afraid to read the next one because I don't want to be disappointed. Great twists and turns and great set up to make you want more more more
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|Really cute and funny movie, not too much gore it was great! Really quite a cute love story too a must watch!!
B00821OX98|5.0|I love this show. I think it is as good as Walking Dead, except with Aliens!!! I am already addicted to what is going to happen next. I have just started watching season one. :)
B00CL151G4|5.0|so I was very skeptical about this show at first.  The only think I know is that I was forced to read Hound of the Baskervilles in high school.  But a friend encouraged me to give the show a try and am I glad I did.  The show is smart and you cannot say that about a lot of shows today.  Jonny Lee Miller's portrayal shows Holmes to be uber intelligent yet humanly flawed.  I like that.  I can get behind a person like that.<br /><br />At first a female Watson seemed weird to say the least.  Could they truly be intellectual partners without the dreaded sexual undertones.  In my opinion YES they can.  Jonny and Lucy have such a wonderful chemistry that leads me to think of them more of being connected by their souls as opposed to any part of their physical anatomy.<br /><br />Sure it may not be classic Sherlock Holmes and I will be the first to say that I'm not a fan of different interpretations of something that is clearly black and white, but this polka dotted adaptation seems to work marvelously...
B00CH26TL8|5.0|this is one of the most challenging games I have played.  each level keeps you guessing and you have to pay close attention to what you are doing.
B008JFUPPI|5.0|I don't know why so many people are saying bad things about this movie I loved it. It was a perfect mix of comedy and action. The cast is amazing and i can't wait to buy it:)
140006922X|5.0|This book is a well-researched, wonderful narrative of the life & times of historical Jesus. I had read another good book on this subject (I believe it was written by a professor of Theology at DePaul) years ago, but Mr. Aslan's book is so much more interesting and enjoyable to read. Putting Jesus' life in perspective to the environment and politics of the time was very educational for me. The many pages of \\"endnotes\\" and reference sources included at the end of the book added much to Mr. Aslan's credibility on the subject. I will check out other titles by this author for sure!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game. This is better than temple run and subway surfers by a long shot. At first I thought it was going to be lame, but since I've downloaded it,I can't put it down.
B0051HNMTI|5.0|This is a great and effective app for those of you who don't have time for an intense workout. I love it!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Good game,nice graphic detailing...some checkpoints are bit hard to play in a tab though..still a nice game to kill or enjoy your leisure tim
B003JUGQ38|5.0|This is my favorite David Tennant season.  Donna and The Doctor have a great dynamic and the season has many interesting episodes.
B0000C1733|5.0|I love this band! And when all the cd warehouses closed in my area I turned to online shopping. I was surpised when the cd got here like 2 weeks before the earliest delivery date! I will be buying more cds from them again!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|It's jam pack of tons of amazing puzzle that will eventually stump you. The game's difficulty curve is perfect the puzzles always are at the perfect difficulty making you want to keep playing.
B00000J0O2|1.0|Will never purchase again. Terrible ink quality. Waste of money. Need to purchase replacement. Really borders on fraud. No more.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I played for 5 minutes before realizing that it is not as good as the console version. I mean really. Great for people who are easily entertained with five legos. No, not even legos. Five linkin' logs. Thats what this felt like.... You can't even use the TnT properly. What's the point if you can't play with the TnT.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This album is great and it was so nice to have it immediately at the time of purchase through my iOS devices.  Thank you
B005KELW26|5.0|i love this case....i bought it at target....it does function as a stand if you flip the front cover over....kindle is secured in by straps....purple color is nice....no complaints so far
0812982622|2.0|My book club selected this book because it won the Pulitzer this year...what a disappointment.  This was one of the most confusing and slow-paced books I've ever read. I forced myself to finish reading it, only to find myself let down by the ending.  The author frequently changes points of view in the book, so you're not quite sure whose perspective you're reading from!  Too many incredulous events occur (specifically Commander Ga)that I found myself wondering what was true and what was fiction.  The author's portrayal of North Korea was horrific, but I didn't find it that terrible compared to my complete puzzlement over the story line.  I've read many great Pulitzer winners, but this one was a huge let down.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|This game is so addictive I go to it when I have some spare time. It's not complicated but keeps you planning ahead to obtain the best score. I've been having a lot of fun with it. I highly recommend this game.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Actually, this app will do the math for you. The buttons are big, good for people like me who have broad digits, and speaking of digits, the display screen is huge. No need to squint; plus which the &quot;free&quot; thing is amazing for a quality app.<br />For more advanced features, see another review or just try it. I did mention the &quot;free&quot; bit, didn't I?
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|I LOVE THIS ALBUM SUCH A GREAT ALBUM I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD GET IT I AM A GOD IS A GOOD SONG
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Several things must be kept in mind before reading this book. One is that the author is an associate professor of creative writing, and he explained that it was like creating the picture of a jigsaw puzzle with many of the pieces missing...consequently a lot of it is guess work. Although he has earned a Ph.D in sociology of religion he is not primarily a historian even though he documents many secondary sources in the lengthy epilogue of references. What he is though is a very talented writer and he deserves the earned honors for his work. However, those who acclaim this work as some new revelation and those who condemn it as a new issue of an old heresy both are wrong. It is neither of the above, but it is a good read. The subtitle says it all, the life and times of Jesus of Nazareth.<br /><br />This book is about events and not dogma. It distinguishes clearly between Jesus as zealous for the work of God and the political group called Zealots that only emerged two decades after his death. As an ordained deacon and long time Sunday school teacher, I found nothing about it that should upset Christians in any denomination. It is based solidly in scripture and also the history books of Josephus. But it is Jesus through the admitted perception of a Muslim scholar. When you take the details with a grain of salt it becomes a very engaging read and likely would make a great movie. However, it leaves a lot of questions about the transition of Jesus the man into Jesus the Christ which as he documents took place several decades after his death through the writers of the gospels - which is what you might expect from a Muslim.<br /><br />So we are still left with the mystery of it all. Why did the first century Christians think they needed a savior and why was Jesus bar Joseph from Nazareth chosen as the one in their minds and what power enabled them to endure and survive the persecutions of Rome to birth the new religion. Having just finished reading The History of the Churchby Eusebius around 340 CE it still leaves a mystery as to what force must have been at work through three centuries that culminated with Rome hijacking the gospels for its own political purpose which changed from rule by the sword into rule by the word by the end of the fourth century. The only plausible explanation is not explored in this book, that it must have been God's will or it would have been different. Some might call it the holy spirit. Although Aslan does conclude that it is all a matter of faith - whatever that is. Of course,that applies to Muslims who are devotees of Muhammad too.<br /><br />In religious history it is difficult to separate fact from fiction and reason from faith, so we must assume it is all God's will. Also, one may wonder how much of his confessed teenage Christian indoctrination influences this work. So, read this book as a work of enjoyable and interesting creative documentary but google Theofatalism to learn what really controls everything from insects to galaxies.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|Helps me sleep and focus. So easy to pick your own sounds and you can save them. The binaural tracks help relax my brain.
B000MGATTE|4.0|I've been a faithful reader for years and years. I haven't read all of King's books but I've read enough to know his style and his voice well enough and this book is another animal entirely. There's terror here, of course there is, but for all that it's more tragedy and hope than anything else. Beautifully written and wonderfully heartfelt, it's one of my all time favorite King books and I recommend it very highly... even if it is a little hard to get into.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I had my doubts, but upon playing, it quickly changed my mind. A lot of action and the updates keeps surprising you with new things.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I wasn't sure about this game, but I have been pleasantly surprised that it is actually fun to play. I have enjoyed it with my family and we get a lot of laughs from playing it.
B0079IEPHA|4.0|This series is fun and light hearted. I enjoy it so much on television that I just wanted the seasons to add to my library. Any one who watches this show will have a nice time.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|a different world or a world of difference. I found myself walking slower, moving more quietly about the house for a few hours after this one. My husband read the book and he liked the movie as well. He also told me I should read the book too.

B005723JSQ|1.0|With all the words available in the English language, why did Ms. Kinsella find it necessary to use the f word on almost every other page?
B006LSZECO|2.0|Found this style of writing very confusing and difficult to follow. Would never read  other books by this author again.
0606267255|2.0|I wish book dimensions would be given.  I was under the impression that since this edition was a &#34;school & library binding edition,&#34; it would be in a fairly large format.  This copy was tiny and the print was tiny as well.  As a middle age reader, it's important to me that the print is not minuscule.
B005LAJ212|5.0|AFter being in the Hamptons last Summer this series really brought that visit back.<br />If you are not from there, it's definitely worth a visit.<br />Great series.<br />Soo many BAD women :-(
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Great story with lots of twisty turns.<br />The main characters are interesting and the facts all seem well researched. Worth watching.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I became engrossed in The Maze Runner from the first page, and raced through the book in a matter of days. Dashner has an amazing ability to create suspense and kept me turning each page yearning for answers about the Gladers and the Maze. However, I would like to have seen more time spent on character depth and growth. Admittedly, this is harder to accomplish amongst a group of boys (and one girl) that have had their memories wiped, but it's what would have really knocked The Maze Runner out of the park. Regardless, the novel will pull you in and keep you guessing until the very end, and which point you will want to immediately delve into the next.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I got this for a little robot project.  I plugged it in and it just worked.  Its easy to import the data into other programs and use it however you want.  A super strong magnet on the back keeps it in place.  Just what I wanted, and a great price.  Now my robot knows exactly where it is.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|It figures that Quentin Tarantino would make the most violent western once he turned his eye toward that genre. But if you can get past the violence (which is actually not gratuitous given the context), you really owe it to yourself to see this surprisingly touching tale of how a small handful of very different individuals intersect in the last days of slavery in America. And as an added bonus, you get proof that Tarantino can indeed write a great love story while still sticking to the best of his movie-making craft.
B00AZMFO9U|5.0|The wife and I loved Maggie Smith in Downton Abby, so were eager to see her in this little gem of a movie. We were not disappointed. This is a great story with a unique setting and real human drama.
B00AK0X5VQ|2.0|a decent game but tries to confuse with big words and such i guess that's too make the people who invented it feel smarter.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|way too many ads for my taste, seems like they didn't put a lot of thought into it. it's a real shame loved the movie
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is the best way to send 90% of videos that i watch on my tablet to TV. It is unique in its own way as it doesn't drain your phone / tablet battery when streaming to TV unlike airplay. Airplay is worst , Chromecast is best. If you already has google tv then you can do all this device does. But $35 common you guys have to like it just for aggressive price. Bring on competition. I like Google's new pricing strategy. Stop winning about Google tracking your data, everyone tracks your data and it ends up in NSA hands.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|need more levels puzzles are great very addicting would like more of these great game add more levels need more levels
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I love this game in part for it's versatility.I can change the speed of play to adept to my energy,skill or mood.The tempo of the music will also change accordingly.Interesting concept and nice graphics-easy to relax and lose yourself in-or race around the universe absorbing and avoiding being absorbed.The music is well-suited to the theme of the game.<br />Excellent buy for the money!
B008PZZUTS|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this older action/suspense film. Robert DeNiro was fantastic! The movie really pulled me in and kept me intrigued the entire time.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|Although not a past Ann Rand fan this was an amazing match to decisions being made today. It definitely makes you question if we are on the correct path.
B005M0X078|5.0|This is one of the best Phantom of the Opera performance yet. I loved it, so I purchased two dvds, one for me and the othef for my daughter.  We did enjoy it first on netflix, so we knew we were sure to buy.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|I love this app it's really fun and you can comb there hair choose a hair Color. you should get this app.
0307346617|5.0|As an avid zombie fan for years now, I had become accustomed to poorly-written, sci-fi literature.  This book changed the game.  The writing is very intelligent and does not stoop to gore for gore's sake.  With each chapter being a different story/interview of a World War Z survivor, the book has a political flavor.  We get to see the efforts of nations as they try to shore up their borders, contain the infection, and protect their own.  My favorite chapter is an interview with a U.S. solider who describes an epic battle in which American military might is defeated by the relentless march of the undead and our own inevitable hubris.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|As an avid zombie fan for years now, I had become accustomed to poor-quality, B films.  Let's face it, they're bad, but have a charm of their own.  This show FAR exceeds what have admittedly become low expectations in this genre.  The zombies are AMAZINGLY done (make-up, effects, whatever) and the character development is, in some cases, complex.  This show is about so much more than the end of the world -- it's about who WE become when civilization dies.  Do we regress to being animals once more, cling to what's left of our humanity, or evolve/adapt?  You name it, this show covers it.  If you haven't seen it, BUY IT.  You will not be disappointed.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I enjoyed the book and even enjoyed to &#34;new&#34; setting but missed Harry's usual haunts.<br />If you are a Harry Hole fan it is certainly worth a read.
B004J713JW|5.0|No extras on BLU RAY -it's the same disc in stunning detail with a mix that some don't like because Billy's voice is way up front and hot - believe it or not - that' s the reason I LOVE IT - I want to hear BILLY more than the band - although the band is spectacular and the CD somehow has a slightly more mixed balance - but in 5.1 it sounds amazing and it's an amazing show.  No-brainer if you are a BJ fan.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This little app lets me stay up to date on my watch list, etc, just like the mobile app does.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I always enjoy David Baldacci's books.  I really liked the main character, Will Robie. The action and the plot kept me going and I couldn't put the book down.  I hope that there will be more books with this character..
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|It never opens it just apologizes and says it was forced to shut down, so haven't played it. I uninstalled and reinstalled and still doesn't work.
B0081I08CI|3.0|This is the second book I've read in the series. The writing and story line are very good, but there is too much brutality against children in these books.  For example, in the first book \\"Game of Thrones\\", Bran, a young child, is thrown off a tower by an adult and becomes paralyzed from the waist down as a result. Another young boy is brutally murdered for a trival reason. In the \\"Clash of Kings\\" a man tells a horrible, graphic tale of being castrated as a child. Also, Sansa, a young girl (12 or 13) is beaten and abused. I am not sure if I will continue reading the series or not at this point. Although I realize these things are often reality, I chose to read fantasy fiction - not tales of abuse and horror, especially concerning children.
B008HRZ4TK|5.0|This is a great app! The easiest, by far, of its type. But I have a question I hope someone can answer: how do I download the &quot;calculator widget&quot; that allows me to hide the photo locker app?
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|True to the spirit of the original superhero.  also good family movie with wholesome script.  I would watch it again.
1589269071|4.0|This book completely changed my perspective on relationships. Different people have different love languages. It is important for one to be aware of one's own love language, so one can tell one's partner what it is so that one can receive love in the &#34;language&#34; one needs. It is important to know the love language or languages of one's lover or partner. If not, one might not be able to communicate and give love in a language the partner will understand. One might be trying very hard to give love, but if it's not in the love language one's partner needs, one will get tired of providing the love and never getting appreciated.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The app works good like the old app version did but the only thing I dis like is the adds and stuff that's asks you if you want to earn points so you can get stuff . Yep that's about it and if you don't like the app just delete it .
B00AFEX83C|5.0|This is an excellent film for people of all ages! I highly recommend it to fans of pixar as I feel it is one of their premier works.
B006RXSW5O|3.0|Yes, this movie is a cult classic. Yes, this movie has some iconic lines. But, the more times I watch this movie, the more I realize that it's terrible in so many ways. Bad acting, pretty bad direction, zero production value. Don't get me wrong - I will watch this movie again, but I can't keep pretending that it's good.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a nice backpage.  It is well built and holds a lot of camera equipment.  It is also the best value.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We watched many times, listened to Mar-Jess' singing and bought the book, fascinating stories and excellent performance. Highly recommened to all.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Glorious music and voices.  Emotional encore with former performers.  I had seen Les Miz on Broadway, but it was only by listening to the DVD that I truly appreciated the lyrics.  I wish a little more effort had gone into DVD packaging so that one knew who was performing.  Tiny print on package was not helpful.
B008JFUR10|2.0|Pacific Rim is a messy brawl between gigantic monsters and robots piloted by BAD actors ready to save the world. If you demand an illogical premise, marginally original characters, badly delivered dialogue, one over-the-top monologue after another  -  then this movie is for you! The ending of Pacific Rim reminded me of the end of Independence Day when they uploaded a virus to the alien mothership. Thrilling, but you can't help but ask yourself what the hell just happened and did any of that really make sense? C-, D+
140006922X|5.0|This book is an excellent historical account of Jesus and his life in the context of the sociopolitical world in his day.  Those who did not grow up with the propaganda of the Christian faith and who can look at it objectively will appreciate it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was confused at the end of the first book, it seemed so Final!!!  I really thought it was over lol, that this was some anthology of a bunch of different stories.  I was  wrong, I feel that there  five books were sewn together in a Wonderful manner.  though there is much dread and a pretty scary realization that knowing people this c would actually happen there is hope in the end (nice ending btw I was kinda worried there)!  All in all a great idea  I highly recommend it.
6304498969|5.0|I believe the greatest set from the greatest guitarist.  As a guitarist myself I spend most of the time watching his technique.  As a fan, you just need to set  back and let it wash over you.
159413586X|3.0|When I first read Mockingjay, I loved it.  Fast forward five years and I know longer know why I liked it.  Probably because I aged, but with alot better-written novels under my belt, I decided to re-read the 1st and the 3rd novels in the series (I don't have 2nd novel).  This time, I came away disappointed, because alot of Mockingjay is questionable and inconsistent.  My biggest gripe is with Katniss and her narration.  In the previous books, her perspective was right in the middle of things, as a Hunger Games participant or as the symbol of the rebellion.  In the 3rd book, she becomes disconnected with the actual events of the world, making it difficult to understand what is going on.  In Mockingjay, she spends most of the novel as a mentally broken, irritable, and dislikeable  shell of her former self.  She is in a constant state of confusion and anxiety, nothing like her previous self, a strong, intelligent woods girl.  Because of her constant detachment from reality, you never gain an actual sense of the massive civil war.  You hear it mentioned, but it's on the back burner for most of the novel while Katniss' personal problems take center stage.  Don't believe me?  Go look at how much of the book Katniss is an active participant in the war she created, and how much of it she is sitting in District 13, fighting her own demons.  You can claim that the destruction of District 12 and her PTSD from the Games are catching up with her, but if so, why is no one else having a complete melt down?  With the exception of Peeta and Jonas because they were captured and tortured, everyone else seems to be mostly alright.  Gale, who witnessed the massacre of his city, uses his thirst for revenge to keep going.  Haymitch, and all of the tributes from the 75th and previous Games are also keeping it together, even though they all know that the slaughter of District 12 was brought on due to their actions.  She stayed strong through the fear and paranoia of the Games, only to fallapart when she was needed the most.  In the final nail in the coffin, she proves that she is no better than the capital and President Snow by voting to create the 76th Hunger Games for the children of the affluent Capital citizens.  For a character created to be the opposite of Snow, she becomes him by allowing the senseless violence and cruelty to continue.  All in all, I felt that the novel was rushed, and in that rush quality was sacrificed.  The main character I disliked wholeheartedly, and with several story inconsistencies this novel went from being the dramatic finale to the firework show to a couple of wet bottle rockets that you buy at Walmart.
B008JFUPFI|1.0|Please do not make anymore Superman movies ,they have gotten worse since after no.2,  I'd be ashamed to be involved with this movie. Hollywood is brain dead!
B00136LVEO|5.0|Sade is the epitome of unusual, sensuous music. i am giving this DVD to one of my brothers as I know he will appreciate it.
B003ZMF26W|3.0|Obviously this isn't a dedicated MMO mouse but it still is marketed as such.  For regular computer use and MMOs it proved to be a disappointment.  It's programming software is unrefined and a slug compared to the competition.  I had to return it once for a warranty replacement and now the scroller wheel squeaks.  This maybe a shooter's gem but to me it's mediocre compared to other choic3es out there for both purposes.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|Can't seem to get enough of this show.  Each season is better.  Delighted to be view at my leisure.  Great show.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|This app is good to clean the phone of unnecessary files and clear space. I would recommed it for any one.
B005TBN3EU|2.0|Don't waste your time with this movie...........but I heard that Hangover Part  III rocks!  I'm looking forward to seeing that one!
B008Y212PI|5.0|I have several of the apps in this series and I love them!  So well done that even the 10x10 grids can be challenging!
B000G6R7B8|5.0|Love this watch. Note that the bezel is heavier than it looks despite being a smaller size. Consider a battery watch if not intending to wear or wind it regularly since it will stop running after 48 or so hours.
B008XG1X18|5.0|LOVE it! Very addicting! I think with an artist's brain and Pinterest feeds my need for beautiful pictures along with a boatload of info. I hope it never goes away.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Absolutely without a doubt the finest series to come out in the last 10 years. Too bad the suits at FOX are clueless and cancelled it.
B000054BF2|5.0|I've been hoping to find this record organically but realized it had been nearly ten years of flipping through records at various stores with no avail. Biting the amazon bullet and picking up this masterpiece was a no-brainer......it's spectacular on wax and comes with a couple bonus tracks (as opposed to the digital version)! Stoked.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Time flies when your playing bingo blitz!  I like how  they call the letters and numbers in the accent of the country where you are playing  ( like Austrailia)  It even has slots too!
B002NN5F7A|5.0|A cast that would be impossible to assemble now brings to bleak, riveting life David Mamet's compelling inside look at the slimy world of commission real-estate sales. It's hard to pick who stands out. Alec Baldwin, of course, has his tour-de-force five-minute turn as the hot-shot motivator. Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino (Academy Award nominee for his role), Ed Harris, Alan Arkin and Kevin Spacey in one room together is a scenario a director now can only dream of, and Mamet's sparkling script gives them ample opportunity to flex their considerable acting chops.<br />There isn't a better character piece around, especially out of Hollywood. Easily one of the best American-made films of the last 25 years.
B00BD62X14|5.0|I heard a couple of snippets of this CD on NPR and simply had to have it. It is wonderful and upbeat. I may not know exactly what she is saying in the lyrics, but that's ok because the melodies are fun and uplifting!!
B0042KZJ5K|5.0|The extra songs are a nice addition to an already excellent CD.  Very nice compilation!  Highly recommended for bluegrass buffs.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|I originally saw this film in the theater and was very impressed. The colors are vivid and the story is simple, yet compelling. The blu ray does not disappoint. I still haven't seen a bad Pixar movie.
B00002DE4E|5.0|I bought this as the everyday copy as not do chance messing my deluxe edition up. Music is five star.  I got the German import , no problems.  But why is the cover yellow instead of white?  It looks like someone peed on it.
B000FA5STS|4.0|This story kept me on the edge of my seat. Lots of twist and turns and keep me interested. It was hard to put down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE it WHENEVER I have free time I play this game my parents have actually gotten anoyed because I always am playing this game
B008XKSW7M|2.0|With such a huge cast, I was expecting much more.There were funny moments, but it was more goofy than funny.  Would not recommend or watch it again.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|it sucks everytime I download it it just stops and wants me to start over and it takes about an hour just for one tiny little percent to move up
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Good read.  Went through this one quickly and enjoyed it.  The story line is fun and full of surprises.  I would read this one again.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I loved this game on my iPad and way super excited that I could finally get it on my Kindle fire.  Start out with this free one then upgrade to the .99 one.  My even got my husband addicted too, but that wasn't very hard.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Not a great work of literature but a lot fun and a great summer read.  Liked this one enough to order the next.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I wish there was a more extended variety instead of the same repeat level over and over and over. It becomes so mundane. Which is a bummer because when i first got the game, I thought it was sooo fun!
B001NLL93W|4.0|This was a fun follow up to the first book, City of Glass. I will order the next in the sequel.
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|I've watched this movie many times (dozens) and it seems each time I pick up another double entre or spoof of the 1950s/60s mindset.<br /><br />Excellent writing and acting is what has set this movie apart over the decades. Enjoy it today.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|I have three of their Cd's and this one is really good. They are more talented than they're given credit for.
140006922X|4.0|I'm a little bit conflicted on this book.<br /><br />Mr. Aslan lays out the difficulties of studying Jesus in his introduction, namely that there is almost no historical mention of him outside of the bible.<br /><br />Because of this, while the book contains tons of really interesting historical insight into the time period, it is still forced to accept some portions of the bible as....errr...gospel (sorry, couldn't resist), simply because no other historical record exists.<br /><br />At the end of the day, the book ends up laying out what is _likely_ to have happened based on the intersection of the bible with other known facts.<br />If anything Mr. Aslan was a bit more deferential to the bible as history than I thought his own analysis rated (ie if you just disproved three statements from the bible, why should I accept this biblical quote verbatim as the basis for your next argument?).<br />I found myself yearning for a bit more classical history as I was nearing the end of the book.<br /><br />To be fair, I have not gone through the extensive notes at the end yet.  I suspect he may have moved a certain amount of scholarly work there (for example, why that particular quote is considered to be highly authentic).<br /><br />So that's one star off there, though honestly I don't know how someone could have done a history of Jesus better given the lack of historical sources available.<br /><br />For the good points, which I do think earn 4 stars, I found the history of the period absolutely fascinating.<br />In particular, the relationship of Rome towards the Jewish population and how Christianity went from a Jewish religion to become a roman religion was extremely interesting and laid out very well.<br /><br />I would recommend this book if you're interested in the subject and don't hold too many pre-conceived notions about the bible.<br />On the other hand if you either consider the bible to be literal truth or complete crap, you will probably be pretty frustrated with this book as it positions itself pretty cleanly in the middle.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Wish there were more programs like this, there was a lesson in each episode... very good for the entire family!
B004INNRFK|5.0|You don't realize how much David shaped modern music until you spend time with this. Easy listening, of all you grew up on.
B003EYVXTQ|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence is the best film actress to come along in a generation.  Never saw her work until Silver Lining Playbook, then went back and watched Hunger Games and this one.  All I can say is -- wow!
B002APU580|5.0|This movie is amazing!! The actors do an amazing job and the characters are very believable. If you haven't seen this movie before you really should see it.... You will love Mr. Darcy!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This storyline was becoming a bit redundant imo but this book shot into a different direction totally unexpectedly. Now eagerly awaiting what is coming next!!! Bravo Nalini!!!
B007EECSFA|5.0|The author is absolutely gifted the way she portrays her characters, places, time periods, but most importantly the mood. The atmosphere. Amazing storyteller, she puts her heart, feeling, spirit in it. The Forgotten Garden was beautiful as well; both books had unpredictable, very touching endings. She is one of my favorite authors. Kate Morton thank you, you are inspirational, keep on writing!
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|I read this before they made the movie and it was so compelling lost a lot of time and sleep before finishing it.  When they made the movie I bought the book as an August birthday gift for a family member, and also included the DVD made from the story.
B005DNPKSQ|3.0|i sometimes wonder if life is just one big television show, it's possible Right? This is one of the few Jim Carry films that i found tolerable because of the main theme of life being for entertainment purposes. i enjoyed &#34;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&#34;  more than this film, although this movie is still worth watching.
B0086700CM|5.0|don't play it but the kids love it .it is a fun game we love it its an aWSOME GAME
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|I am very involved in music and this app has opened up a new side of me. It has lots of dj effects that are fun for me to play with and its all free.
B002FQOI0A|4.0|I was not expecting this book to be like this. I recommend it to kids 9 or 10 plus.  NOTE: this review is from an eight year old.  I am now 10 and 're-reading this book. I understand it a lot better at this age! I can make some connections I couldn't have done when I was eight. This is a brilliant book!!!  Please note: This review was written by a 10 year old.
0062267787|5.0|love it!! i loved getting to know a little more about the charterers i feel in love with in the books
B0042J6VUS|5.0|This thing is small and compact! I use it often for recording piano videos and just about anything else. It doesn't have the annoyance of larger tripods when filming close up videos. Good buy for the money!
B00633W614|5.0|Another hit by Jeffrey Archer.  As with Book 1 in this series, this one is a pageturner.  Archer just never disappoints.  Don't miss this series.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Season 2 was better.  They do have me hooked waiting for season 4...  The Governor was very psychotic... Well acted
0307346609|4.0|Bring on more sequels, Max!  The personal perspectives of the book lend itself to fun reading.  It almost seems that it could happen in real life.
B00D23GXB2|4.0|G.P.A has coined this poetry book his erotic biography.  It allows a glimpse inside of his life with past lovers.  Although erotic, it was done tastefully.  G.P.A has a way with words and they were dripping off of the paper. I enjoyed the read.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|There is a reason why this shirt book is considered a classic masterpiece. The story of Scrooge would make the coldest heart reconsider how they live not just around christmas time but all year round.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This was a very imaginative book. If you've read Neverwhere, you'll find minor references to that novel if you watch closely. I'd love to see the author write another novel to bring the realms together in a big picture. I enjoyed the interesting themes about adults and children in this book. It also made me reflect on my own childhood memories and how they look to me now as an adult.
B000OVLINI|5.0|The words, the imagery, and the tale are just magnificent. Can't wait to experience Barcelona one day for myself. What a riveting story.
140006922X|5.0|The 1 star reviews are written by those whom have yet to actually read the book,<br /><br />do not be discouraged by them.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book, and I recommend it to anyone interested in the topic.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I count on The Weather Channel's accurate forecast. The app for IPad is a little cooler because it has animated weather scenes to mimic what's happening outside. But special effects won't help you dress any more appropriately...
B003I55BIA|5.0|This was a amazing book.I would recommend this book to everyone.I really enjoyed reading this and the characters also.I did cry some.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I love it , its like surround voice<br />Clear voice<br />Nice cable length more 5 m<br />Its great brand name
B008JFUPZI|5.0|best movie ever super funny and action packed must see our your crazy totally worth the money id go see it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is tons of fun. Addictive too! The only issue I have, is that on my tablet he doesn't move as quickly as he should when I swipe the screen.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love how realistic this game is. I would highly suggest for the avid horse or pet owner. I would give more than five stars if I could.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I just assumed this was another love story but there is so much more to this book.  Love, suspense, and sorrow.  Absolutely loved this book, it's a must read.
B002W7J3SO|4.0|I like movies from this era because It was a time before America became the morally bankrupt cesspool that it is today.  Plus chicks knew how to be chicks,  they could be slutty and still pull off the Sunday school teacher look.  I wish women today had any clue how to do that.  Anyway,  to the movie.  It's a Hitchcock film so as usual he does a masterful job of weaving a suspenseful story together.  Unlike many movies from this era they jump right into the action.  No boring lead up.  I mean like 5 minutes in the crap hits the fan and it doesn't slow till the end.  It was a little hard to watch Grant slobber all over this blond knowing that he was gay and probably didn't like it but he's a smooth actor with a great delivery.  It's a little funny to me to see guys wearing suits in some very inappropriate situations but I guess that's how things were done in movies back then.  Even modern movie goers will enjoy this movie thanks to it's quick entry into the action and great story.
B003XRELGQ|4.0|Cat's Cradle is a very Vonnegut'ish Vonnegut novel. It has his light flowing style, and cynical humorous satire which is in many ways is him at his best.<br /><br />It is a quick read, few central characters and very short chapters. Some may be turned of by the superficiality that they may find in the style of the writing, but I find the distance from the characters a strength of the story as the deeper commentary is obviously what Vonnegut is aiming for in the story, the characters are vessel for that and are used very well as that for the most part.<br /><br />There are parts to the story I think are less eloquently handled, I think the relationship between the 3 Hoenikker siblings are changed somewhat through the book, and there are some lose ends in that which I think could have been handled differently so I would not sit with that feeling.<br /><br />To me this is not a Sci-Fi story, so readers who are not fans to that particular niche can (and should) read this one without having preset misgivings.<br /><br />I recommend this book, it has not dated in it's base premise and can be read today 50 years after it was published without that being apparent. I do know that the review title is from the 'Cat's in the cradle' thus nothing to do with the novel I am reviewing.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|any of the one star raters are zealots. what are you afraid of?! I'm guessing the people who gave this book one star also believe the earth is flat and is the center of the universe and the so called notion of American \\"exceptionalism\\" could you imagine being so obtuse?!
B00A6WSTIW|3.0|There are some good action scenes and picture quality was good. It's an obvious take off on Jaws. My time would have been better spent watching Jaws again (for about the 20th time).
B008KS4DR0|5.0|Want expecting much when I started watching this, but it was actually hilarious...as long as u don't take it too seriously.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|And some good stuff to think about, but not a lot of depth. Neat mix of new world and traditional tech.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|Vampires, werewolves, steampunk, and romance that includes tension with good love scenes.  You can't go wrong with this read.  I'm looking forward to her new book's release in October 2013.

B004YR8AJI|4.0|This is a nice product, works quite well on my macbook pro (late 2008, running OSX 10.7). I got however the computer stuck a few times when inserting or removing the memory card.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved how the book incorporated drama as well as steamy love scenes.  It was a really good triogy and I would recommend it to anyone!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this has to be by far the best app I have downloaded yet. it freezes my kindle at times but I don't mind. if you have kids I highly reccomend.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very good read!  I loved the emails ... they were really funny ... and a different style of writing!  Most of us communicate with texting and emails anyway ... brilliant idea to add to the book!  I loved the way Christian learns more about himself and starts to love ... for the first time!

B008AK8FHM|4.0|Daniel Boorsin in The Discoverers said that the greatest impediment to the discovery of the new world was illusion of knowledge.  Dr. Alexander makes the same case for our understanding of this life and its ramifications.  We are indeed bound by our perspectives, and understanding (or ignorance).  His experience broadens our minds if we are open to the possibility.  He certainly helps many people rationalize and better understand what we do not know for certain but accept by faith.

B00B8M4IMK|5.0|If you have iOS devices and/or power hungry smartphones, this is the car charger for you. It is slick, small and well built. And more importantly, delivers enough power to rapidly charge my Galaxy S4 while using my Nav app with screen on.<br /><br />Only drawback is that there is no light to indicate is charging but the phone does so who cares.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Very touching and worthwhile reading. Although I did like his 2 previous books better. Hopefully a new one will be out soon, I will definitely be looking out for it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It's an amusing if simple physics based &#34;race&#34; game where you have a gas and a break peddle with varying types of hills, valleys and gravity.<br /><br />The goal is to get as far as you can without killing the driver, any hits to his head will kill him but you can successfully pull flips and back flips and get extra points.  Based on distance you get points which can be used to buy upgrades, new vehicles and new levels.<br /><br />Given enough time you seem to be able to get really far in the game without buying anything but if you want to throw a few bucks, you can as well.  It's simple and addictive and a session doesn't last long so it's a great twitch game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think it is a great game for horse lovers. It gives you the idea of how much work a real horse can be. I would definitely recommend this game.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I had quick reading  King as most of his books  were filled with language I found offensive.  But this one I could hardly put down. It had a great story line. Loved it

0316010669|4.0|The book came in a good amount of time for me to need it.  I've liked reading it so far.  I haven't been able to read A LOT of it though but I plan to.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|For anyone interested in learning about North Korean prison camps and what it is like to live (and be born into) in camp, you must read this book.  It is the story of a child born in the labor camp, and who eventually escapes.  It is astonishing what he went through and what he had to endure, even after the escape.  It is a real eye opening book to a situation that is not given much attention.  It will absolutely make you more aware of what is going on.  It is well written, easy to read, and it never drags.  The pace is perfect.
1558908382|5.0|I loved this movie when it came out and I still love it.  A comedy with an irreverent look at love, the class reunion and murder was amazing.

140006922X|5.0|Dear Jeff Besos,<br /><br />This is a GREAT book.  Extremely well thought out.  Makes me impressed with Jesus in a whole different light.  Not an anti-Christian book at all.  Very much a historical book.  Not so much for your review system<br /><br />Please overhaul your book review system.  Make reviewers prove that they have actually purchased the book by submitting their amazon purchase info before the review is processed. What has happened in this case and many others is that people who have not purchased or read the book get on and write a review and give it a poor rating because right wing media tells them to do so.<br /><br />My idea will actually improve your sales and keep frustrated people who can't trust your review system from finding another place to buy books.

1451626096|4.0|Philippa Gregory knows her English history, and she is brilliant at creating completely human characters from what history tells us.  I thoroughly enjoyed this latest novel in the Cousins' War series.  I don't agree with other reviews that say Elizabeth and Henry are one-dimensional; I found these two characters to be complex in dealing with the obstacles they face in their marriage and in Henry's relentless attempt to hold the throne. Elizabeth especially shows a wide range of emotions from hatred to love, forgiveness to contempt, all the while struggling with her place in Henry's life.  He loves her, but can he trust her? He battles himself with that question while all around him are rebellions trying to displace him from his throne.  Add in two mothers-in-law that would make any marriage crumble, and watch how Henry and Elizabeth dodge each obstacle thrown in their path to happiness.  My only complaint is that PG ends the novel rather abruptly.  I mean, we are right in the middle of something, and she ends it. I certainly recommend his book to lovers of English history, especially dealing with the War of the Roses.  Also, if you like surprises, PG throws some shocking moments in there!
B0026S1XD2|5.0|It's unbelievable that Mike Oldfield was only 20 years old when he wrote this - even more unbelievable that he figured out how to turn a stereo tape deck into a multi-track recorder. The whole thing is clever from beginning to end and is timeless. Recently remixed, it has a splendid clarity - well worth a new listen.

B00C33M2EE|5.0|After watching the Piano Guys on PBS I had to order these discs.  I play it every day and I can see them in my mind performing.  Music is soothing and upbeat at the same time.  Glad I found these Guys.<br />The passion  comes through with every song.
0394818237|2.0|My 3 year old son likes the Richard Scarry books and characters, but this book and some of the occupations/processes it describes is quite outdated.  I should have checked the copyright date before I bought it.
1490313370|5.0|This book is good enough to read twice. James provides insightful and funny revelations about some of his business startups and failures. His writing sytle is easy to read and conversational and I can bet you will enjoy reading this book!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is amusing, it is more for kids but it is a clean, fun, game for everyone, I would reccommend it for all ages.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This product fails at every turn. I thought \\"For $35 and 3 months free Netflix what do I have to lose?\\". Well $35 on a total piece of junk that I can't even give away and a flat out scam with the Netflix promo. I call it a scam since at the time I bought it Google advertised the \\"3 months free Netflix\\" offer. Then after they sell out google released this statement \\"Due to overwhelming demand for Chromecast devices since launch, the 3-month Netflix promotion is no longer available\\". Really?!?!? Keep in mind this was a day after it went on sale. I bought it prior to the \\"cut off date\\" but like all google products customer service is non-existent and I was never sent a code. Now on to the device. Bottom line it pretty easy to set-up but so is any non-google streaming device. Sometimes it works well sometimes it's a nightmare with horrible picture quality. I have a very fast internet connection and never had an issue running 2 apple TV's, ipads, cell phones, and a roku box all at the same time n the past. When I tested this it was the only thing running. Like similar devices it's always \\"on\\" but this thing gets insanely hot even when not in use. I have used my Apple TV and Roku 3 non stop all day and neither ever got remotely as hot as the Chromecast not in use. I have already disconnected this $35 piece of junk from my TV since that heat 24/7 against (or close to with the HDMI adapter) the TV can't be a good thing. Overall it is yet another google/android device that was far from ready to be released with limits that leave you bored after using it once and with the added Netflix scam I will never make the mistake of purchasing another Google/Android product in the future. Ironically I canceled my Netflix account a while back and have kinda missed it so I was going to keep it after the three months but I am so disgusted with the scam promo Netflix can go right on the list of products/services that I will never buy or use again next to google/android.

B008R96NIY|4.0|The outstanding strength of this excellent work is the portraits drawn of the protaganists.From Pasic of Serbia,Wilhelm of Germany,the unfortunate Franz Ferdinand, Tsar Nicholas - 19th Century men of power in a rapidly and radically new and bewildering<br />world. These men and the cohorts of politicians and diplomats instrumental to this story are depicted with complexity and are more sympathetically drawn than expected.<br />The failures of the diplomats have eery connotions for today, the same sententious arguments, the same blinkered and self defeating nationalism.<br />This is a must read book for anyone wanting to grasp how the great tragedy of the Great War happened.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love this book. Nicholas Sparks is my favorite Author. I can't put this book down. Can't wait for the next of his books.

B00884GR0W|5.0|I was a little skeptical at first when I played the lite version (a little cluelessly) and I was surprised when I found out all these unique features! This is definitely not ripping off Minecraft (which I so dearly love to death) instead, it is using the same idea of blocks to make generating worlds and also making gameplay easy while making it Into an rpg game. However still managing to make unique mob and box models. I have not seen anything surpass it. Survivalcraft is in my opinion, a little bit of a ripoff of Minecraft to be honest. Anyway, I rated it five stars because a full star for graphics. One for ideas. One for nonminecraft related content. One for simple combat. One for the ability to fly, even at the beginning of the game and levelling up and upgrades. And one for a game that keeps me entertained whilst giving me tasks to constantly do.
0544104404|4.0|Superb because of its internet links and verification...<br />Not as relevant to my middle-class family as to those lower class situations; nonetheless extremely insightful.
B00CDCIQX6|3.0|It was okay. it wouldn't be a first choice of a movie to watch. the actors were great. story line wasn't that interesting.
1781162646|4.0|Mr. King has a flair for a good yarn. Not that anyone has EVER said that before. Be it a horror novel or a more even keeled one, Mr. King remains one of the best storytellers of my or any generation, for that matter.

B008HSJVCK|3.0|There's a lot to love in Century 2009, and unfortunately there's also a lot to hate. The novel opens with Orlando, who has undergone a pretty major personality change from how she appeared in 1910 and 1969, and it doesn't feel earned. I would argue that it's impossible to have a 40 year time skip and have character changes feel earned, as a matter of fact.<br /><br />One thing I noticed in 2009 is that Moore starts to use fewer book references and begins to start making a lot of TV refereneces, and I'm ok with that. TV has long since been replacing literature as a source of entertainment and artwork, with shows like The Soprano's, The Wire and Breaking Bad deserving of being hailed as iconic pieces of pop culture like we now view Sherlock Holmes to be. The only problem is that these shows are not in the public domain and Moore obviously couldn't secure the rights to use them, so he has to engage in a lot of narrative gymnastics to avoid being sued.<br /><br />That being said, the main plot of the Antichrist involves a pretty major literary reference, and one that I loved. If you read 1969 and have any knowledge of modern books, you know which one I'm talking about. This plot line saved the novel for me, and made the one's that came before a little more enjoyable. As an overall plot breakdown, I would say the first 50% of the novel is Moore resolving the consequences of the previous novel in a somewhat dull way, the next 40% when the hunt for and confrontation with the Antichrist is pure gold, honestly probably my favorite part of the entire league history, but then it gets resolved with a massive Deux-ex-Machina in the last bit that tarnishes the book as a whole.<br /><br />Like Watchmen and the other League novels, Moore ended this story with a companion piece called 'Minions of the Moon'. This piece provides plenty of interesting back story on the characters, along with it's own worthwhile League Adventure in it's own right. Unfortunately, Moore decided to write it at a Nathaniel Hawthorne level of overly-complicated-and-pretentious writing. Still I wouldn't recommend that you skip it.<br /><br />I went back and forth on a two or three star review, but I decided to be a little forgiving of the way this series ended. Still, I probably won't bother with League for a while.t at a Nathaniel Hawthorne level of overly-complicated-and-pretentious writing. Still I wouldn't recommend that you skip it.<br /><br />I went back and forth on a two or three star review, but I decided to be a little forgiving of the way this series ended. Still, I probably won't bother with League for a while.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this application because it makes me perform math equations when I wake up.  By the time I'm through calculating I am awake enough to quit the app and brush my teeth and all that good stuff.
B008HSJV7A|4.0|Alan Moore begins his Century series in 1910, and the League, while not what it once was, is still a powerful organization of the British Government. They investigate murders and a shadowy cult they believe is planning a global catastrophe.<br /><br />The highlight of 1910 is the coming-of-age tale of Janni Dakkar. Seeing her evolution as a character was a thrill. In addition to her, Moore has written a ton of music into this novel through his side-characters that do a good job of illustrating the themes of the novel, though they can be a bit heavy-handed. And while the literary references have started to get more obscure, they're still fairly recognizable.<br /><br />The main problem with 1910 is that it's too short. And I don't just mean that as 'I wanted it to go on forever'. I mean it as 'Moore rushes through several plot points too fast for them to be satisfying'.<br /><br />Like Watchmen and the other League novels, Moore ended this story with a companion piece called 'Minions of the Moon'. This piece provides plenty of interesting back story on the characters, along with it's own worthwhile League Adventure in it's own right. Unfortunately, Moore decided to write it at a Nathaniel Hawthorne level of overly-complicated-and-pretentious writing. Still I wouldn't recommend that you skip it.<br /><br />All in all, I thought this book was enjoyable and worth the money, but they were downhill afterwards, so if you don't like this one, don't bother with 1969 and 2009.
B00DRDVHA4|4.0|So glad Marc Anthony has come out with another CD. Totally enjoyed it.  Doesn't matter what language he sings in,  he always sounds amazing.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Can you escape isn't that hard, and as it stands now, there are only 10 levels with 5 more in the works. Most of the puzzles seem to just involve clicking on every object until you find something you can either pick up or move to reveal a clue. Other escape games typically have puzzles to help pad out the game, but the puzzles in this game are way too easy. It's decent for a free game, but I wouldn't spend money on it.
B00553U3HM|5.0|Well done Ken.  I really enjoy the depth of this book as it helps me rediscover history while being totally absorbed with the fictional characters. It's a book that's hard to put down.

B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|A friend recommended this movie to me. It was very watchable and it held a good story line, although it jumped around a bit. I plan on watching this a couple more times as I'm sure I missed a few things.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|I have been a fan of Craig Ferguson for several years now but was reluctant to buy this book. I finally purchased the it last week and finished it yesterday and really loved it. It was funny, touching and gave me more reasons to become a fan. What a wonderful story.

B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Which means book 18 is soon to be released.  I am looking forward to this around September 2013.  Jack Reacher has been a subject of our fascination for some time.  Wonder if, one day, he will ever feel remorse for killing so many, 'deserved' or not?

B0038LB4TE|4.0|Never a dull moment with Jack Reacher.  Lee Child always produces many cliff hanging moments that keep you going on.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is really a lovely book - especially if you are a gardener/flower lover.  I wish I had read it before I got married.  Would have chosen my bouquet differently!
B005AVIZ6U|4.0|Then you realise you do not know Jack at all.  Jack Reacher books, mostly forumlaic, but never obviously so, provide an ever entertaining read.

140006922X|5.0|amazing.Stop arguing, shuttup and read it.Seriously, its a great book and has a lot of descriptions,details and historic account. I dont know why everyones so worked up about it. Read it first, then critique.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Everything about this book was fantastic. It sucked me in and I finished the whole thing in less that 3 days. However the ending, although very good, was not very well written. Almost feels rushed and crammed into way too few of chapters.
B00004YA66|5.0|love it its a great movie and it was in great condition and i got it on its pretty awesome
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|Great story about a strange community that tries to avoid conflict or strife by controlling every aspect of it's citizens' lives. Very relevant to today's society where freedoms are slowly being taken away in the name of governmental control. Pretty frightening when you think about it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very KiD friendly game. It's great for ourselves and equestrian. I play it whenever I have nothing else to do.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't and wouldn't put it down. Christian Grey is the ultimate dream guy. Anastasia Steele is a mirror image of my subconscious. Amazing plot, amazing sex, what a kick ass book!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app makes me feel like this is my real pet horse. It's the best. I am so glad to have her and if any of you guys want to get this don't worry it's not a rip off. That'll I have to say because this game is so amazing. Have fun and goodbye.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun to play fun to Care  for your horse easy but not to easy. If you love horse play it if you don't like horses play it you will like it no matter what!
B00B769XB8|3.0|others have done it far better. I enjoy these different takes on fables, history, whatever.  They're usually very entertaining like Abraham Lincoln.  But they let this one slip away, lot's of potential story that went untapped.  There's the same entourage of witches throughout (what kills these things?), in what seemed like repeating futile battles for nothing. And when you see what does kill the witches off, well, it's a letdown.  Had high hopes for this title...
B00BI5J9BC|5.0|I am always so glad to see a clean movie.  The music was just an added bonus - well done!
B007N8RULO|5.0|I can sit here and play all day. It is a good brain work out. I would definitely  recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very enjoyable. challenhing but not too much so. looking forward to more rooms.  did have a lot of trouble with drill in room 10.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I read this book primarily because some of the negative reviews were so hysterical in their fear that I was curious what the big deal is.  I still am.<br /><br />I am an ordained pastor with 15 years experience and five advanced degrees in theology.  Aslan writes like what he is, a religious historian.  His job as an academic is to present a thesis, develop it based on both evidence and his theories of meaning and then let the reading community judge it. He does this well. This is a good and thoughtful book.  I disagree with some of Aslan's conclusions. His thesis makes sense but it is not without problems.  And at times his writing became tedious.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I give it four stars because it is an honest book from a gifted scholar that engaged me in a new way of thinking about the topic.<br /><br />That the author is a Muslim matters to me about as much as the fact that I as a reader am a Preabyterian matters to him.  He is a scholar. That is what matters here.
B008602KQI|1.0|Wow... that was pathetic. I didn't read the book but it had to have been better than this cardboard movie. Acting was not believable, nor were the situations / characters.
B006QPX7UI|4.0|Some movies need periods of dialogue to reflect the inner feelings of the characters. However, this movie takes the need for dialogue to an extreme. The story is compelling enough - Gettysburg really was the pivotal battle of the Civil War and I loved the focus on J.L. Chamberlin during Day 2. Also, the story of John Buford's stand the first day was great, I'm glad that they covered what a lot of books and movies glossed over. If Buford wouldn't have held, it could have spelled disaster for the Union. So the story doesn't need a lot of dialogue to reflect the feelings of the participants. But for some reason, the director chose an almost 2:1 ratio of dialogue to action. And some of it is totally gratuitous, like the exchange between Chamberlin's brother and the rebel soldier. By 1863 it was pretty clear to everyone what the motivations were for each side, there would simply be no need for such an exchange. In any case, great action scenes nearly spoiled by excessive dialogue.
B00DM0XXCM|5.0|Really surprised at how much I liked this movie - watched it twice on a 48-hr rental. But I'm a sucker for a good love story...and yes, I'm a guy! 'Course it doesn't hurt to have Spiderman's main squeeze, Kirsten Dunst, beaming great looks as usual. Great premise, fantastical scenery and such a mind challenging setting. Enjoy the &#34;Fantasy&#34; of the environment and don't let your practical mind dig into how this could really exist - many rules in planetary physics broken or bent. You have to pay attention, though, throughout to get the ending...the very end! If you don't, it's still a good love story.
B007C12RDS|4.0|My girlfriend is very sad that she won't be able to watch more of this now that she's watched every episode.  Who do we talk to in order to get more of this show created!?
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Fun little game, plus it has a nice path to acquire upgrades in game that keeps the game interesting.<br /><br />Bit of a learning curve but that's part of the hook that keeps things interesting.
B004U8VWLE|1.0|i actually turned it off after an hour.  I didn't care about one neurotic cast member.  Not a one.  the end.
B00DHNJGCU|2.0|Given the cast I was really hoping for better.  Unfortunately my wife and I got bored with it about half way through.
B00BCMT4RA|5.0|Cruised for an hour down to Santa Cruz early one morning,<br />this CD made it really  enjoyable. The Bonus tracks with the horns?<br />Ah man, they bring it! What a tight CD.  Born, one good Album!
B001HLZMUE|5.0|I originally saw the Rocky Horror Show on stage in London in 1970s as a student and it blew me away.  More latterly this superb movie came out and really has become an instant classic.  Tim Curry rocks as Dr. Frank N. Furter and the rest of the cast are just as magical.  I really can't say much more than has probably been said better a thousand time.  Let's all do the 'Time Warp', smile and get on with our lives a little happier for the experience.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|This is my husbands all time pick of dvd's.  What a wonderful story I would like to travel there just to see the statue of<br />Hachi.  Dogs bring such joy to the lives of their owners and this story is what that is about.  JOY
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Every once in a while, an author imagines a new world or future that has little or nothing in common with works that have come before.  Author Hugh Howey does that in \\"Wool\\".  Without giving away any spoilers, in \\"Wool\\", a remnant of humanity is living in huge silo, and has been for perhaps hundreds of years.  The climate outside of the silo is supposed to be highly toxic and doesn't support life ... or can it?  The author weaves a good tale that explores life within the silo, replete with good guys and bad guys, believable in an almost-science fiction sort of way.<br /><br />Mr Howey is able to create sympathetic characters in a short time frame, which is good, as several of them meet with untimely ends.  (This is a plus for the book, as knowing death stalks the protagonists sharpens the sense of tension.)  The only thing even remotely negative is that I felt that the book was a bit rushed and uneven toward the end.  But overall, the writing was excellent and the plotting strong.<br /><br />In this \\"Wool Omnibus Edition (Wool 1 - 5)\\", author Howey collects all five of the \\"Wool\\" books into a single book.  I rate this collection four stars and strongly recommend it.
140006922X|5.0|Well I've NOT read the book yet but look forward to doing so.<br />See how the review figures are so polarised? You can see instantly what's going on, especially since the recent \\"in-depth\\" interview from Fox's ex-pageant queen confirming concerns (somewhat over-persistently) that, as a Muslim, Aslan can't possibly be qualified to comment on the [so-called] truth value of Christ's virgin birth, miracle works and resurrection with quite the same authority your average relijuss s***-kicking red-neck emminently can(!) ;)
1401310672|4.0|Considering how much this book costs, the time spent reading it was minimal due to the brevity of each page. However, there were many autocorrect incidents that had me laughing aloud, and that's why I bought the book.  I found this to be very entertaining and will probably pass it on to friends and family who have a sense of humor.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Very fun especially if you are a fan of dinosaurs and the Jurassic park series every cool<br />To really like the game and so does my son

B0044C5SCU|3.0|We decided that Fringe was a series we wanted to watch from season 1 episode 1 all the way to the end (season 5). Just finished watching season 3 and it's getting a bit confusing and not as exciting as seasons 1 & 2. But we're still enjoying it.

B000FC1MCS|4.0|Sometimes when reading a book, I don't want it to end.  This is not one of those books.  I was ready for it to end, as reading it was enjoyable but not one of those.  However, as far as books that will linger- this is that type.  You will have a difficult time getting the story out of your head.  It is also a great understanding of Austin/Asperger thinking.  They are all unique but this was very well done.

I will have to say the first half of the book is a little  boring with all the studies however the last half makes up for it.  I would recommend this book to anyone that is serious about getting rid of fat (my love handles are slowly going away) that exercise can't remove.
B0094K1PW4|5.0|A good movie that is a good sci fi movie if you stick with it so it can grab you

B0013TXA5Y|2.0|Too much all at once. Its like the author decided to see how much info she could cram in the book. Don't get me wrong, the info is important. But dang, the info to actual story ratio is not about 3:1.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|I Love This Movie. I Don't Know Y A lot Of people are against it. It's a good and fun movie. When I saw the Main title to film I was singing with the song. A very good Pixar movie I think. Can't wait to see it again on DVD. :)

B003V1WXKU|3.0|Some of it resonated with me, most did not. No physics whatsoever which was disappointing, seems he avoided as much as possible talking about science.

B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The headline says it all. This show is incredibly well written and the cast (while relatively unknown) is genius. Funny, poignant, and they all have great chemistry - especially the two male leads. I HIGHLY recommend Season 1 and 2 of Suits!!

B000X1T7MS|5.0|This book is very intense and to the point.  I hope that it does not lead to hating Muslims, that is not the point!  Their religion is based on hatred and supremacy, but the people can be very warm and caring.
B004Q8LDL2|5.0|Good story line that is well acted by a strong cast. Sean Connery is always entertaining and it is fun to see Ed Harris in the villain role. Even though this is an older movie, picture quality stands up to today's standards.

B00BH0VSM6|2.0|I'm still somewhat new to the world of crime fiction, so I find myself gravitating toward whatever novels have been spotlighted by newspaper reviews and websites like Amazon. The results can be a bit mixed, but I've steadily made my way through some classics like Raymond Chandler's The Long Goodbye and bestselling sensations like The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. So while the pleasures of crime fiction's esoteric corners are still to be discovered, I'm developing a happy acquaintance with the genre in general.<br /><br />In the past few years Jo Nesbo has gotten a lot of press for his novels, which have been translated from Norwegian and published in the United States at a pretty rapid clip. This sort of immediate wealth of material is great once you're entrenched in the author's world, but figuring out a place to enter, at least for me, can prove a little daunting. So when I read the first Harry Hole novel, The Bat, was finally being released stateside, I decided to begin at the beginning with Nesbo's most popular creation.<br /><br />Because Nesbo is a Norwegian author writing about a Norwegian protagonist I, for some reason, expected The Bat would take place in Norway. So I was more than a little surprised when the novel opens with  Harry Hole making his way through Australian customs. While this jarred with my expectations of the book, it wasn't a problem in itself. What was a problem - the first in a laundry list - was the way Australian characters constantly slipped into tour guide mode, dedicating large swaths of dialogue to fun factoids about Australia and indigenous folklore. At times it was borderline ridiculous; with characters interrupting, say, a high intensity chase to share some \\"fascinating\\" Australian trivia.<br /><br />But my biggest gripe with The Bat was the mystery at its core. The crime, the clues, and the culprit were all in place, but for some reason the murder of a young Norwegian expatriate fell flat in the telling. The plot turns and revelations never felt well set up or earned; just clunked into place to keep the plot moving. It was as if Nesbo assumes a murder is prima facie interesting, and when he does try to dress up the story's crimes, they're inadvertently silly. Speaking of silly, when the murderer is finally revealed the book nose dives into cartoonish absurdity with a final act so over the top it is positively groan inducing.<br /><br />The Bat's only real saving grace was Harry Hole, who was an interesting enough character to hold my attention through the story. As a sleuth he's of the standard deeply flawed, genuinely good natured variety. And although his vices are pretty run of the mill, I found his back story and the unpredictability of his character really fascinating and worth following through an otherwise less than dazzling story.<br /><br />It wasn't surprising to discover this was Jo Nesbo's first published novel. In Harry Hole Nesbo evidently found a character strong enough to sustain a series of thrillers, but it seems pretty evident why US publishers weren't in any particular rush to release The Bat. So as ridiculous as The Bat was, it was enjoyable in a perversely hammy sort of way. I'll certainly give the Harry Hole series another shot, but next time I'll rely on reviews rather than chronological order to make my pick.tions never felt well set up or earned; just clunked into place to keep the plot moving.

B00AHXIC50|3.0|Not a bad album by Bruno Mars. Very talented. My 3 year old daughter loves his 2 singles, &#34;Locked Out Of Heaven&#34; and &#34;Treasure&#34;<br />Thought album would have a little more R&B feel to it, but instead It definitely seemed more &#34;Pop.&#34; Doesn't make it a bad album. Again, He is talented and it shows on this album. Could have done with out the expletives for such a pop album. Again, my 3 year old loves to dance to those two singles....I could do with out hearing saying &#34;your sex takes me to paradise&#34;.....LOL!
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Great movie, as are most directed by Tarantino.  Disc played well.  I didn't see the original, though, so I'm not sure how it compares.
B008220DIC|5.0|Well I guess people who rate this film one star are not the type of people who like to see actors at their best. It at least deserves two for that alone. I do happen to be one of these people and I still feel this film is not quit as mind boggling as others do and beyond that feel it did most things quite right.<br /><br />Dianetics and Scientology are clearly at play here but to what extent I'm not even sure, and nor is it totally clear what is good or bad in the film. PT Anderson seems to mix up a lot of real life events into this film. Hubbard had a lot of Navy experience and lied about a lot of it. He was sexually deviant no doubt. Freddy at times almost seems like another version of Hubbard created to show the differences between Man and Myth. Dianetics was changed or melded into Scientology later on, as Hubbard was worried about losing the rights to Dianetics, and a certain scene kind of reflects this in the film as well, though, this film is definitely no biography more a summary of the events through a different filter. I implore people to give Wikipedia or the like a spin about Hubbard and then watch the film. You might be amazed at all the connections you make.<br /><br />The Master, and any film like it, is going to experience the same exact criticism from the growing number of people who simply cannot watch a film for two hours without a large payoff. I credit all the digital happenings in our lives with leaving a culture unable to grasp the beauty and grace in a vision like this. And it isn't just this film. Many films which leave the viewer to ponder the events rarely set the audiences on fire these days. I honestly did not feel this film was slow at all as opposed to something like Lincoln which at times I felt needed to be edited better.<br /><br />Now this doesn't mean people need to rate this 4 stars or even 3. But 1 to me says a film is worthless, a bottom tier mess with no value. That cannot be further from the case here. I dare say that any supposed cinema lover who can't at least enjoy the spontaneous energy that runs through this film is off their rocker and should stick to Spielberg and the like who give you what you want at face value. Go watch a film you know will have a payoff, a happy ending, a quirky twist and good acting. You know where those films lie.<br /><br />What really gets me is all the people who feel the need to start off their one star reviews with personal anecdotes on how they love cinema and obscure films. It makes me think they don't believe in their review or their intentions are somehow not going to be understood by others. Almost like they are pleading to be heard and followed themselves. And in that voice you know you shouldn't trust them. I think everyone should at least view this film on bluray as it is meant to be seen to make up their own minds about its so called payoffs or not, all in all. Not unlike Malick's Tree of Life film, which in my mind needed two more hours to express all it had going, this one may have been edited almost too much but it certainly has enough going to explain itself unlike the other which simply felt incomplete to me.<br /><br />This is a tough film but obviously not as surreal or hard to crack as Lynch's Inland Empire or something of that sort. Even going into this I knew there wasn't going to be an ending that wrapped things up tidy but I was satisfied. Freddy seems to be the invocation of the rebellious and timeworn human spirit in all its flaws and addictions. The mind is left to wander and question the juxtapositions in the film but I feel they are fairly spot on in many instances at least from my point of view.<br /><br />Pertinent questions still remain of course but they do in all of PT's films. We still in reality don't know all that much about Scientology, where from the film gets a lot of its input. But like all questions we can piece them together to come up with answers we can be satisfied with. I compare this film, at opposite ends, to the masterpiece Inland Empire in that people who go into the film knowing what they want, needing something from this director based on passed appearances, could possibly be heavily disappointed. Time moves on. PT Anderson wants his viewers to think in abstract ways and to make symbolic connections. The party with the guests is HEAVILY dependent on your ability to recognize the symbols and so is the so called sand sculpture bookend with the film. If you can't do this or simply don't want to you might as well stop watching his films. There Will Be Blood and Magnolia were no different.<br /><br />The film is a work of the ensemble in that everyone here helps sell the vision. A true piece of passion that lives and dies by the moment. I had a wonderful time being introduced to these characters and settings and for that a director and cast need to be complimented. Is it my favorite film? No. But I lean towards a 4.5 rating. It's an enigma, unsettling, gracious, and pointed in its ability to keep my attention and make me think for myself at the notions it subtly reveals about human psychology and enterprise.<br /><br />I take one scene in particular to heart. The jailhouse scene where the two male leads are vociferously arguing against each other. How Freddy just for a minute pulls the master into his own world. Where the first and possibly only signs of a crack in the armor of his philosophy show themselves afoot in a world he is still sure of but may not be able to fully control. There is a lot to think about in this one scene away from the film. How people speak of this film as empty is beyond me. It certainly got me thinking about the way Scientology has produced a large swathe of followers. About how different people view time, personality, memory, leadership/friendship, and cults among other ideas.<br /><br />After this scene we are treated to a personal dining room scene with the master and his family and their concerns about Freddy. When he shows up the two male leads are wrestling friendly in the grass. The master is determined not to fail his friends and initiates. But in the end the master himself cannot reach into everyone's life and cannot control them for the sake of being guided and 'bettered'. Scenes like that described bring a smile to my face as they are played perfectly and yet still get you thinking deeply about the characters, about their lives off screen, about what else hides behind the veil, and about how it all might connect to actual people and ideas in reality.<br /><br />Look, I don't need a stop sign in front of me to know I need to stop for a child crossing the street. And I certainly don't want or need a handbook on screen to divulge everything but apparently a lot of people do. What they wanted was an edgier Spielberg type of pic. A Lincoln without the schmaltz and the boredom maybe, although, that film wasn't too bad it certainly was pretty straightforward with a decent ending. Another rather talky film but I didn't have nearly as much fun in that one. This film to me is purely a spectacle. I think it stands on its own. More a character study of the human than a biopic. I find it interesting among the many ideas it shifts and sifts through. It could have been longer even, containing more information about the characters, more detail into its philosophic ruminations, it could have been many things. For what it is I appreciate it. And I for one do not think Daniel Day Lewis deserved the award over Joaquin Phoenix. His portrayal of Freddy is amazing. As good as the former star's role in There Will Be Blood nearly.<br /><br />Anyway you have it this is an easy 4 star film. I am at about a 4.5 here. I have no problem recommending it and quite honestly have no idea why people didn't enjoy this one. All I can say is the attention spans are dull and intellect in this society is thread bare on the whole if this is a one star film. It isn't. Give it a try at least. And for god's sake don't watch a low-res DVD of this film.<br /><br />Note: The bluray hovers around 24Mbps and looks good to my eyes but could be better. A very fine layer of grain and great detail throughout the 2.5 hour runtime.leads are wrestling friendly in the grass. The master is determined not to fail his friends and initiates. But in the end the master himself cannot reach into everyone's life and cannot control them for the sake of being guided and 'bettered'. Scenes like that described bring a smile to my face as they are played perfectly and yet still get you thinking deeply about the characters, about their lives off screen, about what else hides behind the veil, and about how it all might connect to actual people and ideas in reality.<br /><br />Look, I don't need a stop sign in front of me to know I need to stop for a child crossing the street. And I certainly don't want or need a handbook on screen to divulge everything but apparently a lot of people do. What they wanted was an edgier Spielberg type of pic. A Lincoln without the schmaltz and the boredom maybe, although, that film wasn't too bad it certainly was pretty straightforward with a decent ending. Another rather talky film but I didn't have nearly as much fun in that one. This film to me is purely a spectacle. I think it stands on its own. More a character study of the human than a biopic. I find it interesting among the many ideas it shifts and sifts through. It could have been longer even, containing more information about the characters, more detail into its philosophic ruminations, it could have been many things. For what it is I appreciate it. And I for one do not think Daniel Day Lewis deserved the award over Joaquin Phoenix. His portrayal of Freddy is amazing. As good as the former star's role in There Will Be Blood nearly.<br /><br />Anyway you have it this is an easy 4 star film. I am at about a 4.5 here. I have no problem recommending it and quite honestly have no idea why people didn't enjoy this one. All I can say is the attention spans are dull and intellect in this society is thread bare on the whole if this is a one star film. It isn't. Give it a try at least. And for god's sake don't watch a low-res DVD of this film.<br /><br />Note: The bluray hovers around 24Mbps and looks good to my eyes but could be better. A very fine layer of grain and great detail throughout the 2.5 hour runtime.
B001M4YZ90|5.0|Great movie, great director.  I would definitely recommend anything Guy Ritchie (except for Revolver - the horrible exception to the rule).  I really liked Mark Strong in this, as well.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Simply put this is the best super hero movie ever made. Definitely worth watching more than once. Any super hero fan is sure to love it.
0312857063|4.0|Great series.  I would double check the size of this hardback first.  The one I ordered wasn't the standard 9+ inch hardback the rest of the series is in.
B004VD3YIM|4.0|allows you to see what you need and control your cameras wherever you are (with access to the internet of course).
B002NZK5QY|1.0|While the movie itself is a classic, the product was horrible.  There was a &#34;made in Mexico&#34; stamp on the back the movie just stopped and went black.  This has happened with some other movies, so I didn't bother asking for an exchange/replacement.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I'm enjoying it so far. Cool cards, great interface. What more can u ask for in a free to play game.
B003ITZBVI|4.0|Never read the comic storyline but I like the movie. I'm sure that now this story is no longer relevant after the DC universe wide reboot. However, this is still a great movie with great animation, voice acting, and plot. Well worth the $.
B00947N6D8|5.0|Love this movie. Reminds me of why being a kid was so special. A must for any family. If you don't love this movie then there is something wrong with you. Also I ordered and my DVD was in my mailbox the very next day, extremely impressive even for AmazonPrime
B00846REIS|5.0|This is a great book to read for those that are a fan of the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy. I would argue that it is even better, not just in terms of plot but definitely in terms of writing as well. Day is a seasoned author and that reflects in her work.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Juliana is AMAZING in this series!! This is the best of LA Law-era courtroom drama blended with modern day family and romance challenges.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Strong characters, clever plot twists and good acting make this a must watch show. Lets hope there are many seasons to come.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|One of the best new, and unexpected, albums of the year. Reminds me at times of Mumford, at others of a more pop influenced Dave Matthews.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Great game on train home. Passes the time nicely.<br />Love the music and variety of puzzles. Fun time. Would highly recommend.
B003TSEL7S|1.0|This book is a sequel to the perfect Jackson series and it is great. You should read this great book to find out for yourself
B00BESFWBY|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie from start to finish. I just love true life movies. I loved both  Jonny Weston and Gerard Butler in this movie. They made you grow to love these characters.
B005TBWN0K|5.0|it is really interesting, love it:)  i have used it for many things and i love drawing:))  i like how they have everything ordered.
B005COO1X6|3.0|It's been a while since I read King's books. Not being an expert, but I would say this was normal King, nothing spectacular. End came quite fast, could have been better.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I am so very addictived I can't believe it. Hours of great fun. I like the breeding part  and visiting other lands. I just love it.
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|This is a well-written book, remarkably short in length (another reviewer said that you could read this under 4 hours, which is correct). There is sufficient data to support the authors' premise that technology will lead to ever-widening unemployment gaps for the majority of people, while giving technical minds an elite position with society (which they term superstars). There isn't a specific panacea that will solve this dilemma. That said, there is surprisingly strong imagery within the book, especially revolving around the archaic puzzle of the chessboard.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome and I think that everyone should play it<br /><br />He vs d no sunshine Suffolk south civil Citicorp custodial v Tyson quip Pam Alan also grammatical hedoNistic shakiNg fish bc chicken chicken Irish trial iron
B000JLTRIG|5.0|such a good show I wish it was still on. love love love this show. all I need is season one
B0087IT8FK|4.0|I love this movie. It is a great story. I have never cried and laughed while a movie as often as while this one.<br />Unfortunately it does not exist with English dubbing. Only with English subtitle.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|The characters are fantabulous! I give each book two thumbs up! If you have not read these yet then you must!
B008C20TDG|5.0|I have bought a lot diet books, vegan, vegetarian  and low fat books. I've read a lot of other books regarding celiac disease, building bones for people with low bone density, arthritis, heart disease, cancer,ulcerative colitis and ect. This is the first book that put everything in prospective for me. This book had helped me understand why a Paleo lifestyle would be healthier choice and would  enable me to lose weight.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I just could not stop reading these! They are so well written and exciting! More people should read this most definitely!
0143036424|5.0|I can't wait to read the next in the series!  I loved the show and the books so far have been great.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book was awesome!! I enjoyed reading the whole series! I cannot wait to see book one in movie form!
B004SB60OC|5.0|The Music is awesome!!! I love it!!! If you like Christina perri , this is a must buy! Jar of hearts is a wonderful song.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book could be sappy...but it wasn't ! I loved the subject matter in  a sad sense of love and watching the characters unfold and develop a sense of self and other was quite interesting. The right to be in control of how you live and how you die is timely; but it's the relationships that make this book a good read!
B00CDY6HW6|5.0|basically this is a &quot;bunny&quot; version of the classic Lemmings game. Fairly straightforward ifnyour familiar with Lemmings. No suspicious permissions either only the one that prevents phone from going to sleep
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|I gave this book 4 stars...hard to love it...the scenario is, as said...possible and as we have seen probable. The relationship angle is interesting and can be befuddling at time. I loved the Mom, hated the Mom...worried about the Mom...same with Dad and then there is Kevin...inborn or? You decide...it is gruesome and somber and maudlin but the insights may be worth taking to heart!
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Fantastic CD! I watched this special on HBO several times and finally went out and bought the CD. I am impressed with Gaga and this musical arrangement.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|ALOT OF TROUBLE LOADING PAGES AND VIEWING COMMENTS.  FRUSTRATING WHEN TRYING TO GET TO HOME PAGE....SEEMS TO WANT TO GO TO PROFILE UPDATE INSTEAD OF MY WALL
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|A lot of 80's trivia that was super obscure and I have never heard before, but when there is something you recognize it brings back memories. Pretty good story overall even without the reminiscing factor
B0029LCJJS|4.0|I have never watched The Tudors although it's years old.  A rainy weekend of scanning the Amazon Prime offerings got me started and now I'm hooked.  Highly recommend.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved the way this book was written.  I really felt like I was inside the minds of the characters, and what they were thinking felt real.  I would absolutely recommend this book!  It's sad, but also hopeful.  Great read.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Love this show so i had to get the next season. I wish there had been a package deal, buying them seperate is a little pricey
B00CH87HF4|5.0|It. Is. Awesome! You get to fight monsters, explore valenthia, find LOTS OF TREASURE!<br />it also has a story unlike DH3 which was a not as good as this.<br />I recommend this to anyone who's played the BGDA series.
B002WJI63A|5.0|Looks great, it's a bit smaller than the other ones, but the dress is surprisingly flow-y.  Is a must have for anyone who... wants it?
B00BLF9FOK|4.0|Yes, Arnold is getting old, but he acknowledges that in the movie.  Much of it was filmed a few miles from where I live, so I was predisposed to liking it.  The action is fast and furious, if sometimes a little over the top, and if you like cars, you'll love this movie.  I'm still not sure if the good guys didn't kill more bad guys than had actually shown up in town in two SUVs, but maybe I'm miscounting.  Like all action movies these days, at the end the hero and bad guy end up fighting with bare hands, having used up all their various guns and explosives, but it is almost believable here.
1616550414|5.0|It's got a lot of really cool artwork in there, and really fascinating little notes from the artistic directors of the games.  The actual timeline is just kind of thrown in there, and is somewhat interesting.  However, the main draw is all the artwork. Ballerific.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I never used this app once so i can not sya what is good and bad about it. So yeah
1401219268|5.0|Don't make the same mistake I did, and judge that this book might not be able to hold your interest if you've never read graphic novels before.  This book was complicated, satisfying, and long!  (Long in a good way, don't worry)<br /><br />READ IT.
B004SIIBGU|1.0|I never used this app once so i can not sya what is good and bad about it. So yeah
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I thuoth that it was cool but I payed for the map pack and I came back to play it and it was gone
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I like this app, I am able to take my digital books anywhere with my phone app. Good little app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fantastic game with great graphics and all sorts of brilliant stuff I think it's the best game on the planet I play subway surfer 24/7!!
B004GFN11A|1.0|I never used this app once so i can not sya what is good and bad about it. So yeah
1582701709|5.0|Change your mindset and your life for good with The Secret. The way to living the life you've always imagined that no one will teach in a school.
1609611543|4.0|I haven't finished the book, but find it very interesting, so far.  My PT recommended it to me, that is why I bought it.
0425263924|5.0|Sylvia Day is a fabulous writer. She tells a story in a way , you can really understand how the characters think and feel.<br />I can't wait for the next book in the &#34;Crossfire&#34; series.
0425263924|3.0|I really enjoyed the first 2 in the series.. But have to agree, the story is being stretched out. Eva seems so immature for Gideon. I really like Cary but come on...
B003O86FMW|5.0|I absolutely love this book! I didn't think anything could beat the first one but this did. I recommend this book to everyone. Seriously you should read it.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This story was so compelling, holding your interest completely.<br />There were many twists and turns in the story that the reader kept thinking he knew what was going to occur, but it was always a surprise.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It was a good fast read for the beach, it was good to have it on the Kindle so I didn't have to worry about who would see what I was reading so intently!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I love this app it is very realistic and has the main guns of the Americans and Germans but this app would be even better with more guns such as the mp40 or mg42
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like the size  of the buttons and the display, and that it keeps the running total of your work.
B0064NTZKI|5.0|Frank self-portrait of the usually reclusive Allen is surprisingly revealing and insightful. Allen uses no artifice in discussing his life and art very unpretentiously
0316227706|5.0|This book has some truly unique photos that really capture the essence of dogs. Perfect coffee table conversation piece for animal lovers and photography buffs alike.
B00BOXZAG6|4.0|I enjoyed this film. The love story was simple, even too much so.  However, it served as a platform to have a completely different set of physical laws. I have to admit that I enjoyed the mental exercise to see things happening on both the floor AND ceiling, as well as in 3D.<br />Its cheap too!
140006922X|5.0|... that are writing reviews without reading the book. It is really sad to see such non Christian behavior. Please read it, form your own opinion and then provide a review. If not, you are lying.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My husband ended up watching and he enjoyed as well?  Love the era of clothing.  Some of the home furnishings are still popular today.  Look forward to season 4 but not the wait.
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|Maybe its just me, but I can't seem to get rid of the constant low-level buzzing sound when I use this mic.  So far I've been able to mask it with low music during post-production, but still its a hassle.  Other than annoyance, the sound quality is excellent!
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I became a fan of Follett after reading Pillars of the Earth.  I did enjoy Winter of the World but I found the first half of the book a bit slow and it has taken me a long time to get through it.  That being said, It was very interesting portrayal of what the lives of the people may have been like during the war and Hitlers time.  For that I recommend it
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is the best game ever. I just started and it looks like I'll be having it for a long time.
B00E6D4HHO|3.0|So another special limited collector's platinum edition gets to see the light of the day.<br />I'm not going to lie: this one looks really awesome BUT there are of course some things I don't like about it.<br /><br />1. The name: Okay, this is just me being a nitpicker but on June 18, 2013 Marvel released a boxset called Wolverine: The Adamantium Collection which includes the most important stories about Wolverine. The X-Men universe is so diverse, why couldn't they come up with a different name hence both collections are released within half a year from another and it may confuse some people.<br /><br />2. The claw: I don't have anything against the idea that they used the Wolverine claw at all. I like the character and I understand that he's one of the most famous characters (or did you see a movie which was just about Cyclops, Storm, etc?). The thing is, and I speak from experience because I bought the [[ASIN:B0083SBMGW Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One - Avengers Assembled (10-Disc Limited Edition Six-Movie Collector's Set) [Blu-ray]]], how they are going to implement it. With the aforementioned collector's set at first you got to see a nice suitcase including an imitation of the Tesseract but once I finally received it (I'm living in Germany, so I got it like 3 days after the release, thanks to Amazon!) my heart dropped a little... The case was smaller than I expected, made out of hard plastic - which wasn't that bad though, and the tesseract is just a chunk of white plastic which lights up.<br />It's comprehensible that a bigger case made out of metal would be much more expensive to produce but most of the people who buy such things are collectors as the name states and therefore ready to pay a little bit more if the quality is right.<br />I don't want to talk excessively about that collection now but I'm just worried the same thing will happen to this one: a fake-leather glove with silver plastic claws.<br /><br />3. The movies: First of all I don't have anything against the X-Men movies. I think some of them are great while others are not so great but you have this problem in every movie franchise. I'm just happy that they are still making movies about the X-Men. BUT if you are going to release such a collection and you know that another movie is coming out a few months after this release WHY couldn't you just wait some more months to make this collection a definite complete collection or at least make THIS one a special edition for the new Wolverine movie? I hate having 5 different complete collections just because there are a few things different from one another (i.e. the Bonus disc from Iron Man 2 which is omitted from the Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 1 Collection for whatever reason..).<br /><br />Enough ranting for today. I'm sorry for any mistakes I made but English is not my native tongue ;)
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I got the game for my son, he really enjoys it. A bit buggy when fast pace action happening, otherwise good game<br />.
B0072HDP9M|5.0|Bitter-sweet and captivating. If you enjoyed the movie, you will probably love the book. The characters of the book seem to linger around for a long time after you have finished reading.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Best show I have watched in a long long time!  It grabbed me at the first episode and hasn't let go yet!  I'm up until all hours of the night catching up on past seasons.  Now that I know what I know I cant wait to start over at season 1 again!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Kids who like despicable me and the minions will love this game.  This is also a fund game for adults.
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|I had a great afternoon viewing the movie Tangled with my grandchildren. WE sang and clapped.  What a Great Saturday afternoon!
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|I liked the movie and found the subject to be an eye opener.  They say old age is not for sissies, and this movie shows<br />some of the obstacles to over come.  I feel the movie is suitable for seniors and a little slow going at first but ended on a very positive note. The cast was believable and perfect for their parts.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I love this series so much I honestly can't put these dam books down. wink wink. I started only 3 weeks ago and now I'm about to start the 6th book!<br />-Camille
B001OL4TR4|5.0|This is a beautiful love story.  Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfieffer are perfect as the two star crossed lovers and Matthew Broderick's conversations with the Almighty offer just the right amount of humor.  I have always loved it and was happy to find it on Amazon although the visual quality is not as good as I would like, especially at $10 for a movie that has been around for such a long time.  However, with no sex and no profanity it is simply a really good story that the whole family can enjoy and that's worth a lot these days.  If you haven't seen it, take a chance, I'll bet you like it.
B0009P66TK|5.0|love my new watch, great design. i'll buy more invicta watches, size it's not to big, perfect for me. recomended
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This game has a lot of great puzzles in it. I have not finished it yet, but I know that when I do, I will most definitely want more! Bring on azada 2
0062068415|5.0|One of the pleasures of my teaching job is that I am sometimes asked to teach a class that is out of my \\"jurisdiction\\", and \\"Film and Literature\\" is one of them. The last two times I taught it, I used Dennis Lehane's [[ASIN:0062068407 Mystic River]] followed by Clint Eastwood's adaptation. This summer I thought I would change things up and use Lehane's \\"Shutter Island\\". It turned out to be a great decision; the class ate it up.<br /><br />Many of my students remarked that they were chilled while reading it; one even compared it to reading a Stephen King novel. And this jibes with my impression (and the impressions of many reviewers here) that \\"Shutter Island\\", at its core, is a Gothic/horror novel. The elements are all there: the lunatics; the killers; the evil doctors; the raging storm, etc. Lehane does a wonderful job of making an island feel claustrophobic and a mind wide-open to possibilities--not all of them good ones. Unlike many of Lehane's other works, especially the Patrick and Angie series, this is not really a whodunit. This is more of what exactly is happening and why. Like all psychological thrillers, the path is dark, frightening and full of unpleasant surprises.
B004I9CXHW|4.0|MMI interface is Audi/VW's horrible quest for royalty..but assuming that you are able to overlook the proprietary nonsense, the adapter itself is pretty well built and works well.
140006922X|5.0|Okay, actually, haven't read the book because I just ordered it about 20 seconds ago - in hardcover.  I bought this book for one reason and one reason only  - because of the fake one star reviews here and the head explosions all over Fox and the rightwingnutosphere.  Happy to add to Professor Aslan's income from the book!  On the other hand, having read the helpful reviews (both Amazonian and editorial) I am actually looking forward to digging into the book when I receive it later this week!!
B005QYKE2Y|5.0|I really love transformers movies and they still don't dissapoint the acting a good and its just not cheesy.Hope they keep making them good. So far so good
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Loved it and I think it will be great for my son when we go camping.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Just like subway surfer only it has minions from despicable me. Your character wants to win minion of the year and get a big award
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love this game, besides using a lot of diamonds very fast and being asked to buy them is a great game,I haven't spent any money yet and I don't plan to, but it may take a lot longer to advance
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|This is the first I have played the Metal Gear series, and it lives up to its name. Great games. Quickly becoming one of my favorite series of games ever. To answer a lot of concerns I am seeing in other reviews, MG1 and MG2: Solid Snake are in the main menu for MGS3. Also, the code for MGS1 and VR Missions are in the documentation near manual, by the konami store ad. In addition, you are getting 8 games for $50.<br /><br />Very fun games, and 8 games for 50 bucks is never a bad deal.
1594200823|5.0|This is a must-read for anyone wondering about the health crisis in this country; nevermind the disappearance of small farms from much of the landscape. The good news is that the word is out about corporate agribusiness and its downsides, and we largely have Michael Pollan to thank for waking us up to some stark facts.
B00594XOZU|5.0|you can text lots of people and even group messages.which is great. text all your friends .talk any time .
B008602KQI|4.0|I loved this movie. While at times cheesy and gorry, it was a great film with high entertainment value. A must see.
B004Q0R7FG|5.0|My nephew loved it! He was jumping up and down as he was unwrapping his birthday gift! Little boys love trains!
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Don't think too much into the movie. It is what it is, you see some of your old action movie stars shooting everything in sight.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great book not liking the ending there better be another one soon. I want to see what happens to them next.
B000JWTX3Y|2.0|Lindsey Lohan is main character, need I say more?  Clearly done when she was starting to go off the rails.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Love the convenience of weather on the go. Shows areas I choose at the touch of a finger. Easy to read and love the graphics.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Full of intrigue suspense, drama, action. A historical thriller that has so many twists and turns you are never sure where it is going until you get there. Jawdropping and addicting an excellent read!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|A compelling continuation of the game of thrones saga. If you liked the previous volumes you'll love this one. Enjoy!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Well it is a very good for the time to use the word American and grownups for kids and grownups.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I have only gotten as far as level three but I absolutely love this type of game.  So far this is great.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like this because it is so much fun, it remind me of subway surfers battling bad guys. I approve!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is awesome. its soooooooo addictive. I played on my step mom's phone and after one level I thought &quot;wow. I'm getting this game when I get home.&quot; then when I got home I did it.I knew it was awesome but I didn't know THIS awesome.I use awesome a lot. I DO recommend this game 100%. but it can be stratigetic I think. it means you need a strategy. GET THIS GAME. P.S. (IT WORKS ON KINDLE FIRE ; I KNOW ALOT OF PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THAT. IT WORKS.) BYE -BYE.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is no more than a period drama soap opera, but the lavish sets, stylish costumes, and stellar acting place it in a category far above normal soaps. A series to be savored.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The story is interesting. I read this book back hears it was going to be a movie. Would make a great movie
0345803493|5.0|I discovered this series through my sister. I am so glad that she told me about these books. I absolutely loved reading them. I couldn't wait to order the second book. The price was great and I actually didn't have to wait too terribly long for shipping.
B0087GF8ZG|3.0|I bought this night light because of look and ratings. I cannot put on wall like my slimmer previous one, which had velcro. It came with a double sided black sticker, which you would have to pull off to change batteries and put on a new one.  I think that would be messy!  I had to return!
0307593525|5.0|I use this all the time. First, she is hilarious! It's just plain fun to read. It's easy to look for a recipe. The table of contents make it a quick and easy reference. This would also be ideal if you just wanted a fancy cookbook to make your kitchen look awesome. It's pretty and practical to use.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Fabulous acting (needless to say) but what really sold me was the dialogue.  They don't hit you over the head with the obvious as most network dramas do.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I hope that doesn't sound too arrogant, but I am disappointed with the difficulties of the game. There should be an expert level or something that is a little more challenging. Even still it's one of my favorite games. The sound and controls are very relaxing. A good way to pass time when you have some. Though it's limited in the amount of brain power it requires of you.
B00DURGZHW|5.0|This movie did not get released to theaters in my area, so I have been anxiously waiting to buy this. I was not disappointed.<br /><br /> This movie has a lot of coming-of-age moments, intermingled with the harsh realities of life, for a young boy growing up in Arkansas. It was beautifully shot, and water played a huge role in the plot. The boat in the tree, I believe, represented Mud's life up to that point in his life. Once it was lowered, and out on the open water, represented his future with his \\"dad\\".<br /><br />This movie is excellent, with all of its deep undertones of what love really means. Some of the lessons Ellis learns are hard-won. Wonderful acting by all. It seemed that they were all just \\"being\\" the people they played in the film. I really hope this film wins some awards...it truly deserves to.
B0041KKYCY|5.0|$10.00 saved my friend's bacon after Roscoe the rottweiler ATE a borrowed movie. I never got to watch it just bought it thru my account to help her out so I dont know if the movie was any good or not, but her stepdad didn't kill her so it got the job done, was brand new in plastic as described and only took a week to get here so I give the transaction an A++
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Such a beautifully written book.  It made me want to visit each country the story was based in and to share the love of all the characters.
B00005LK94|5.0|I had forgotten all about this movie.  I ordered it for my 4 kids.  Even my 12-yr old son who initially gave me a hard time about seeing the movie loved it.  I recommend the movie for all ages.  It is definitely an &#34;uplifting&#34; movie.  Enjoy!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|If you are a Batman fan, it's nice to have all three of the movies in one set.  Very good price.
B00CDV4RS0|5.0|i watched this movie a long time ago some movies do not stand up to time but i feel this one does if your looking for some action and horror this movie is one for you
B00B7VPKMY|5.0|Listening to the Eagles brings back great memories, but it was a hassle to listen on vinyl. Finally I got my whole Eagle collection on CD.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I agree with a previous review ....This would make a great movie.<br />The characters felt real to me and I didn't want the story to end! I am definitely going to check out more from Mr Howey.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I am amazed that something so captivating and entertaining can be so much fun. And it's free. I wonder what the paid volume can do?
B00B2YH7D6|4.0|It´s hard to find here in Mexico, so it was worth it.<br />About the movie it´s really good, a little bit of nostagia and a great sense of what music should be.
B005EHILV4|5.0|I now have full control over speaker, mic and headphones volumes from this mixer! I wanted to get the more expensive one and I kinda regret not buying it. This is worth the money, but if you're like me you're gonna want more then the 2 eq bands.<br />This is GREAT! But if you want a little more get the next step up or a few steps up and you'll have a decent basic 3 band eq & basic compressor which can come in handy if using a microphone over the music and want to manage the output levels. (Of course this is assuming you know what a compressor is & how to use it)
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|The first hour was painfully slow. I thought character development was choppy and dialogue between characters was lame. I would have turned it off after the first 15 minutes but my husband wanted to see it to the end. I am not a fan of Jude Law but his character, to me, was the worst of all, uninteresting and boring.  Next disappointment was Catherine Zeta Jones. I think she is talented but wondered after watching if she still wants to be an actress. In addition, you see very little of her in the movie. Rooney Mara to me was the biggest disappointment. The word that comes to mind that fits everyone's performance is flat. I admit this movie could have been something if it wasn't slapped together with little focus on character development.  Movie probably had bad direction. The story line was the best thing about the movie. The best scene played was the one near the end between Ms Jones and Mara. Now here is where you saw some genuine emotions! Other than that a pretty bad movie IMO.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|A required blu-ray to have if you are a movie buff.  Interesting cut, and nice bonus stuff as well.  No-brainer.
0307730697|5.0|More than a war story,the molding and development of an outstanding warrior :relentless,determined,very courageous.A story of redemption and transformation.I highly recommend this book.
B0031TZ8TU|5.0|I love this book.  I read it when it originally came out.  I had a copy of the printed book for a long time, but gave it to a friend.  Wanted to re-read it, so I bought the Kindle edition.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I ordered my Chromecast on the day it was announced and just received it today.  My tv is a 2006 40\\" Samsung LCD, so it's an older set and not smart.  Before the Chromecast, I was using my Blu-Ray player for YouTube and Netflix playback, but it was a cumbersome enough process that I hardly watched either of those on my tv.  It's not that it took a super long time to boot up, but it was a multiple remote control process that took enough time that I'd rather just watch videos on another device.  In just a few minutes with my Chromecast, I was swiping through movies and videos on my tv and was immediately extremely pleased with my purchase.<br /><br />First, the price made it almost a no-brainer to try out.  When I received it, the packaging was simple and nice.  The scant directions on the box are all you need to set this up.  It took just a few minutes to plug in and set up with my laptop.  I was guided along the process with very simple, easy to follow instructions.  Within five minutes of taking it out of the box, I was loading up my first Netflix show.  I set it up to work with my phone (DROID Razr Maxx HD) and tablets (Nexus 7 and 10).  Using my phone as a remote was cool.  When waking my phone up, a nice fullscreen showing my current Netflix show with options to pause, stop, and rewind were displayed.  Being able to make calls and send texts while controlling playback was amazing.<br /><br />This is a great little addition to anyone who doesn't have a smart tv and would like something easier and seamless to view Netflix with.  It doesn't take up any space on your entertainment center and it makes watching videos a breeze.  Because of my Chromecast, I'll never have to juggle three remotes or wait for my Blu-Ray to boot up and load.  That in itself makes this purchase a winner.  I'm excited for the future apps and compatibility that will surely come in time.  For now, though, I am extremely pleased with my Chromecast and would highly recommend it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Very entertaining and addictive! Only downsides are the in-app purchasing and that your energy doesn't refill as quickly as I would like.
B009WUBERW|3.0|I would call this B grade entertainment without much of a story.  Action Filled for many looking for escapement from their daily chores.  However it was nice to see action heroes that are all over the age of 50, gives us all a little hope.
B000EXZI1E|5.0|Okay, and their 90s, and 00s, and 60s, and even 70s. Bee Gees rock. All time favorite songwriters and band.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Enjoyed the movie.  It you want something that is filled with action and a good family film to watch with children, this one would be a good choice.
B000HL0EEE|5.0|liked the series because it helped explain some of the workings of the shows.  ( transporter etc.)  wish they would renew the series
B0009XNUK0|5.0|There are many, far more qualified people who can tell you how amazing Michael Jackson was.  Every song is amazing.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Long and drawn out. I love the suspicion and thriller affects but it's so boring when it happens over and over. You can almost predict the outcome. Great love scenes though.
140006922X|5.0|Reza Aslan's decades of scholarly work bears fruition in this well-researched book on the founder of Christianity. There have been countless books already written on the father of one of the world's three great religions yet Dr. Aslan manages to breath new life into a topic that is decidely familiar to over a third of mankind.
B00CSR2J9I|2.0|Not what I expected; expected something more than running a road.  Plan to delete it unless my grandson wants to play it.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|Sorry, don't try to put this album in context and say it's great. An album should stand on its own. This one sucks. Straight up.
B00A757EFW|3.0|The game appeared smaller on the screen than I figured it would be.  Maybe I missed the scoring info, my grandson had to tell me what to do.
B000FZETIO|5.0|This might be old school but its good school! Love molly ringwald can't get enough of her! This is a funny movie I would tell anyone to get this movie!
B004SIP6BI|1.0|Wish i could rate zero. Have never had problems when ordering. Was charged for this movie, says it was delivered but unfortunately, and sad to say, i have yet to have it.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I really like this game because it entrances me, making me want to keep going to solve the side puzzles. Great entertainment, and the puzzles really make you think!

B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I love your game its fun because I play with my friend all the time and we both play together
B0063IH60K|5.0|SIMPLE and fun. Passed a lot of time while ill. Still a challenge to improve score. Some of top scores listed seem unrealistic.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Every summer I reunite with Harry Hole, and this summer was not a disappointment. The recently released first in the Harry Hole (pronounced holy) series, was by far a welcome respite from some of the beachy reads that have not exactly lived up to expectations. One of my favorite flawed characters, it was awesome to FINALLY be able to read the first installment in the series.<br /><br />The Bat follows Detective Hole to Sydney where he is investigating the death of a Norwegian citizen. As someone who has spent considerable time in Australia, I enjoyed reading about my favorite character in a city I knew well.<br /><br />Expect the usual exciting plot twists and turns that will keep you reading until the early hours of the morning. The only disappointment I experienced with The Bat was when I realized it was over. Alas, see you next summer, Detective Hole.<br /><br />(This review was also posted on my Goodreads account!)
B009AP2G26|5.0|Every episode of this season makes me laugh and cry through every emotion!!!! I have never enjoyed a show as much as this one! The creators of Glee have saved my life!!!
B00DYEN5QU|4.0|This is a theatrical review of \\"Man of Steel\\" and may contain spoilers.<br /><br />Like Spider-Man and Batman, Superman gets a reboot as director Zack Snyder, with a big assist from producer Christopher Nolan, conjure a darker setting for the Krypton immigrant. The film opens on the doomed planet Krypton where Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer) have borne a child, conceived the old fashion way which is illegal based on the government's genetically manipulative mandate. Consistent with Superman lore, the planet will soon self-destruct mostly due poor management by the government.<br /><br />In actuality both Jor-El and Gen. Zod (Michael Shannon) have beefs with the government, but Zod acts on his own authority which gets him sentenced to a lifetime of floating in space. Jor-El and Lara manage to send baby Kal-El into the void destined for Earth along with some magical codex which will allow Jor-El to materialize later and provide fatherly advice. I was quite impressed with this original act. The artwork is excellent and there is a nice mixture of advanced science mixed in with rides on flying dragon-like creatures.<br /><br />As the scene changes quickly to Clark Kent working on a fishing boat then a young Clark having to \\"save\\" a school bus that plunges into a lake, I'm wondering where all those earlier years went. We do get to fill in the gaps as the film occasionally goes into flashback. What makes this second act compelling is that we understand Clark/Kal-El's dilemma. His adoptive parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent (nicely played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), believe Clark (a bulked up Henry Cavill) should keep his super powers a secret. They are rightly concerned that this \\"difference\\" will ultimately be detrimental to his growth. Mankind has a history of not always accepting others who may be different.<br /><br />Clark eventually leaves Kansas searching for the right answers. This leads him to the Arctic where he finds his biological father in the form of a codex hologram. Jor-El suggests that Clark was sent to Earth to improve human existence where they failed on Krypton. Lois Lane (Amy Adams) has entered the picture by now. She's a prize winning reporter who is searching for the mysterious man who has saved many lives.<br /><br />\\"Man of Steel\\" does depart from familiar legend in several ways. First, Superman is only spoken once that I recall. The \\"S\\" on the eventual suit is a Krypton symbol, not an \\"S.\\" While Superman can indeed be weakened, it isn't by some glowing green rock. Most interesting of all is that, there are few secrets between Clark and Lois. We don't have to ask ourselves why Lois doesn't recognize that \\"Sup\\" is Clark with horned-rimmed glasses.<br /><br />So where does this movie begin to falter. In the final act, as Superman must deal with Zod who was freed when Krypton exploded. Zod, and his hot lieutenant and man hater Faora-Ul (Antje Traue), want the illegally conceived Kal-El destroyed and wants to take over Earth for his own species. The movie goes into full out \\"Transformer\\"-styled destructive mode. While some will feel this adrenaline rush is needed after the cerebral middle section, I found it tedious, loud and frankly, pretty boring. We've all seen it before in \\"Thor,\\" \\"The Avengers\\" and many other movies. It goes on forever. It's as if the producers said, \\"Hey, we've still got some budget left, let's get the computerized wreckage in high gear.\\" Those looking for romance and humor will find little of it here. I suspect we may see more of that in the next episode. A final note. I saw this movie on a big screen (not IMAX) and in 3-D. I found the 3-D to be very good if conservative. That's the way I like it.ther in the form of a codex hologram. Jor-El suggests that Clark was sent to Earth to improve human existence where they failed on Krypton.

B00BFUUMO8|5.0|this game a wild amount of fun and entertainment, Successfully tied the film with the game as never before a combination of thrill.
B0094KTBBG|5.0|Watch it, watch it, watch it and then watch it again! This on and &#34;Up&#34; are our families all time favorite animated movies…ENJEOY!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Ever since I bot the game I have been addicted to it. I highly recommend that you play this game you will fall in love with it instantly!
B005544V6A|5.0|I started this series because I was looking for a show to hold my interest while I exercise.  I was instantly hooked.  I even find myself looking forward to my workout (well almost) so I can find out what happens next.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Fun and entertaining. I play 2-4 x a day. The game does lag at times. I will complete research buy the dinosaur.. i place it and log out.. come back later like 20 min or hrs later just depends on when I'm back to check.. an  every thing is gone my moneys back the dino is gone and I've got to research all over. Other wise if that gets fixed this a. Fantastic game for all ages
B005544TRQ|5.0|I was immediately hooked after watching the first episode, that I'm now already on Season 2. It is a must see!
1577314808|5.0|An amazing transformational tool, particularly for those ready to grasp his concepts.<br />Learn what peace really is, and how simple it is to live in the now.<br />Eckhart speaks directly to each of us, and  will guide you in every step of your personal journey.<br />Duane
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|The game is very cute. Very popular with friends and family, however I personally have not much luck playing it. I would recommend it to anyone.
140006922X|5.0|As a Christian, I was fascinated to hear Reza Aslan interviewed on a radio show recently and hear his historical take on Jesus of Nazareth (in my life, of course, he's Jesus Christ.  To Aslan and other historians, he's Jesus of Nazareth.  Works for me).<br /><br />Aslan's ability to place early Christianity in the historical context of the upheaval in 1st century Judea and Rome gave me several new insights into the New Testament.  I haven't yet finished the book, but as a history major I have really enjoyed the look back at the times in which early Christianity was developing.  I had read Josephus's writings before, but have encountered as clear an explanation of how they said a lot about they way Jesus was viewed in his own time.<br /><br />As for the silly, silly criticism of a Muslim writing a book about Jesus, it's strange that one didn't hear the same hue and cry when Noah Feldman (an American author who is also Jewish) wrote his outstanding book on Islam, \\"After Jihad: America and the Struggle for Islamic Democracy\\".  I'm sure some of Feldman's views on Islam would be different than some Muslim's views, but it takes nothing away from his scholarship and his excellent arguments.  Same goes for Aslan.<br /><br />Read this book!  It's extremely well done and there's a lot of great stuff in there!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham is a good storyteller.  He introduces colorful characters, he injects a good amount of wry humor, and the surprises in this one were of a new and different sort.  I gave the book 5 stars b/c it delivered a good story in a good way.  Great summer read.  If you want heavy literature you will have to go to a different list of books.
B003ODL004|4.0|Hanzs Zimmer is the best in the business, and he shows it here.  The movie is great too, and the music is a great fit to the scenes.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|Sudoku on the kindle is a little easier than in the newspaper because you can put all the little &#34;pencie marks&#34; in the squares which is a bit difficult in the newspaper.  BUT it also keeps your solving time, so besides solving the puzzle, you can see how fast (or slow) it took you.
140006922X|1.0|Truly one of the most offensive books out this year from an actual scholar.  What garbage.  Almost every premise is based upon a twisted representation of facts.  The author should be ashamed.  The only ones praising this must be band-wagon anti Christians and specially anti-Catholics.
B001P42YCC|5.0|I am a BIG fan of James Lee Burke and Tommy played the part well.  But sometimes one must divorce themselves from the books and just see the movies as a separate entity.  I works better that well.<br />I truly enjoyed the movie.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series. It is intriguing and I love the English. I like learning about things I am not familiar with and being in an Elite position in life is something I find interesting.  There are a lot of stories for all of the family members and their servants. Its a great soap.
140131046X|4.0|This story captured me from beginning to end....engaging, creative, and inspiring. This author goes beyond the rules of religion, to demonstrate that all of us are truly one, when we believe in a Divine Spirit, a Higher Power. And, many of us come to know that faith when we face death. I highly recommend this book, from a very gifted author.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved it, Loved it, Loved it. Very well done. Sets are great. Characters are great. Maggie Smith is always a delight.
B000002JEV|5.0|I bought BBC Sessions over a year ago but only got to listen to it recently. I was literally blown away with the rawness. I warn you it's addictive.<br /><br />Joey Ramone in 1976 claimed that the Ramones trademark sound was partly  based on Zeppelin's Communication Breakdown. This is the version he must have heard. The three versions of Communication Breakdown on BBC Sessions are extremely raw. The first version -  the 3rd song on CD 1 -  is pure punk.<br /><br />The songs are ADDICTIVE.<br />If you enjoy the raw Zeppelin sound you will will be hard to go back to the studio sound from the first 4 albums. In addition, the song Travelling Riverside Blues - a genuine diamond - stands out as it bridges the  rawness of the First 4 songs - Whole Lotta Love, Communication Breakdown, Dazed and Confused - with the southern blues of I Can't Quit You Baby, You Shook Me and How many More Times, begin the last 4 songs on the end of the First CD on the BBC Sesssions.<br />(NOTE: One reviewer writes that he can only listen to THIS version of Stairway to Heaven [found on the second CD. I warn people that its addictive].<br /><br />Jimmy Page the Magus;<br />Jimmy is at his best. His work on I Can't Quit You Baby, You Shook Me and How many More Times.<br />at the end of the first CD is breathtaking. Keep in mind, that they were not millionaires when these songs were put together. Zeppelin were relatively new and hungry. I am currently exploring the Rolling Stones. Stones fans like to brag about the so called \\"greatest rock band\\" and their BBC Session box Sets. The Stones lack the harsh rawness of Zeppelin as well as their sophistication.<br /><br />I played Never Mind the Bollocks (Sex Pistols) just prior to listening to the BBC Sessions. The Zep songs are actually rawer than the Sex Pistols ... even Dazed and Confused. It would have been magnificent had Zeppelin released BBC Sessions instead of The Songs Remains the Same in 1976 as it would have given Mclaren something to worry about.<br /><br />5 STARS for a true hidden Gem. Enjoy
0316228583|2.0|I had to go back many times to finish reading this book. Altough well written the different characters are very depressing and a little too harsh for my taste.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The recent changes are at best, a step backwards.<br />I have enjoyed this app in the past, but feel recent changes are not what I want.<br /><br />Maybe someone will look at changing it to something better.<br /><br />I will be waiting.
B00DP3IGJ6|1.0|I was prepared, after Minority Report, to be grudgingly impressed with Tom Cruise working in sci-fi. I was prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, the writers on this one were purely awful. So while it's a very pretty film indeed, it has plot holes big enough to fly a spaceship through, and that ruined it for me.  I won't spoil it here in case someone else decides they want to watch it and ends up liking it, but honestly, it was an awful plot. About 10 other sci-fi movies have done these individual concepts better. It felt a bit like the origin of the term \\"hack\\" for writers: someone took a dozen other, better films, chopped them to bits, and randomly stuck those bits back together to make this. When it's done well it ends up being a \\"mashup\\" or \\"x meets y\\", but in this case, \\"hack job\\" is what comes to mind.<br /><br />But - it's very pretty. Very visually atmospheric. Sadly, not good, but very pretty.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|If your a Sherlock personality fan you should like this.  It's a pretty good mystery type and the insane genius is pretty even not too much but quirky in a fairly believable way.
B009CS0VNW|2.0|I received the book in a timely manner, but the quality of the book was poor.<br />It was a worn paperback with stains and marks throughout.<br />I was very disappointed in the quality. I was hoping for a used book in<br />Very GOOD condition that I could add to my personal library, but I am<br />giving this copy to goodwill.
B00886XQO0|4.0|Turtle Beach Call of Duty Black Ops II Ear Force Tango Sells at Best Buy  For $130.99<br />It's worth the $130 price tag but not the $200 plus that everyone else is selling them for.
0307352153|5.0|I've known for a long time that I am an introvert.  What I didn't realize was the extent to which it was affecting my work life.  Susan Cain's book gave me insight into my own challenges, as well as a way to effectively communicate them to the managers to whom I report.  Well researched, readable and useful!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|I really liked this game.  It was easy to navigate and puzzles were not bad. Worth the $2.99 . THERE were not any glitches with my Kindle Fire.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this app constantly. Lots of fun. I recommend it for anyone that enjoys Solitaire. When I'm reading a book, I enjoy taking a break and playing a few games.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|If you're like me you love adrenaline pumping action flicks with lots of explosions, chase scenes, and killer robots.  Well, fear not young man, for this is a very solid super hero flick without all that emotional hogwash that permeates some other failed attempts at the genre.<br /><br />It's about saving the world from the forces of evil, what's not to like?
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|the game is okay for passing time but it can take away lives that are not used before you tat a chance to use all five. example will be using the fourth one and when ready for fifth it has disappeared!
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Great product, works well in the car with little interference. Clear phone conversations and is easy to use  while driving.
0142421715|1.0|And that's all there is to it. Except I need to write more so... It's bad. It's everything bad every bad review has written here. If I could, I'd ask for my money back. The first one was already like: Okay... Let's give it a chance, maybe it'll get better... And in some - minimal - ways, it did. This one?<br /><br />Wish I could hold the persol who wrote the whole 'wuv' review 'cause it's the best one so far.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have seen both movies and I loved the comedy in them. When this game topped the free games chart I had to take a look at the spin off of my favorite movies. I wasn't disappointed at all with the game's initial first impression and I dodged rockets and mines and electric fences and Vector's robots in no time flat. Then I reached a stasis point: all of the missions required Facebook. I don't have a Facebook account, nor do I want one, and I found I had to grind for Gru Coins through achievements and daily free tokens to complete the challenges I couldn't pass because I don't have Facebook. It would be nice if those challenges only came if you had Facebook active and not if you don't. Still, it wasn't bad otherwise and I'm not going to have one little thing remove a star or two. A good job overall, and definitely needs the update for El Macho's Lair. I can't wait for it come out! :)
0061978078|5.0|Don't get me started on the third book or I might punch someone... But THIS ONE, the second installment, it's hands down the best book in the trilogy. Best writen, best plot. Of course, I loved the first one -- or I wouldn't have read this -- but Lena grew stronger and all the awesome people she got to meet... It'll be a favorite in my heart. Forever!
B00448SE4S|5.0|Really enjoyed watching this one. I love comics and I love video games, and this movie took both and mashed them together.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Fun movie to watch.  I saw it a few years ago and wanted to familiarize myself with it in planning to watch the RED II.
B0033VUH6A|2.0|the plot of this movie is so unrealistic as to border on the absurd.  Without giving away anything, the final &#34;act&#34; is totally unbelievable.
B00CDY6HW6|5.0|I'm not sure what devices and carriers others have, but game downloads in less than 3 sec on ATT and plays very fast on my Note 2. I've been waiting for a game like this and it is cute for the kids too. The hint screens seem to duplicate a lot and often aren't for the level, but not a big deal.
B002KKCVT6|5.0|got this for hubby, and it came fast shipping and fit like a charm, hubby is very picky about shoes and other things that i got him, but this one so far he hasnt complain a bit, great product, will buy agian when this one need to repair.
B008P9M614|5.0|I don't generally like TV Series dramas or comedies, but this show is the one exception. Hugh Laurie, the star, is a genious. I get into medical stuff, which is why I started watching it, then I became fascinated with the Dr. House character. Not like any other TV show. I didn't catch the first years of episodes, so now I can watch them all from the beginning. I like the fact that it has a little comedy in it, too.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book is a favorite.  It is the best. I think it is better than the movie. This is my favorite book I ever read
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|please hurry with the fourth book...i am having eva and gideon withdrawls....love this series....it is a must read. cannot wait til next book.
B005LAII80|5.0|DREDD is objectively the greatest comic book film ever made. Buy it so that they might make a sequel. Please.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|As all of Nesbo's Hole books (that sounds weird), his writing is engaging...his books are the kind that keep calling me back;&#34;READ ME some more!&#34; This one kept me very interested and in that world. There is SO much about the drug scene in Oslo, but needed for the story. When oh when will they make the &#34;Snowman&#34; movie? He is such a fabulous author.
158270208X|5.0|very pleased. came fast and in mint condition, and i would reccomend this book to everyone who thinsk and likes to think positive
B007WCJSWA|5.0|Wonderful album. The \\"I love you\\" rewrite (ocd) alone is worth the price of admission. Great tunes, lots of variety - yes it sounds like Mike Stern's writing, because, well, Mike Stern wrote it. Not sure why some reviewers find that to be a problem. If you are reading this you are probably a Mike Stern fan. Heck, if you can even read, you should be a Mike Stern fan.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Great game, highly addictive. Recommended for anyone over five years old. It's a challenge. When I get 3 stars it motivates me for the next level.
140006922X|5.0|Aslan writes as a scholar and offers a fair and balanced account of the life of Jesus.  I'm not concerned with his faith tradition; I'm concerned with his scholarship.  Great book.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Great Movie Loved it some of Thor's acting was a bit ehhh but Natalie Portman made up for it :) Great movie my son loved it..
B0053TMP24|5.0|I'd recommend this to everyone in the world. Not only that but also to my friends Lance and Logan.:)!<br />Done
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great Movie Loved it Can't wait for the next movie... :)  Great movie my son loved it.. I would recommend it
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book was so well written and the included history makes it even more of a page-turning novel despite the indulging story of Diana and Matthew and all of their troubles. If you are interested one bit in supernatural stories, read this one!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Book was so much more than I anticipated, very good.<br />Downside? I would have loved about 10 more chapters! Thanks
B001ANSS5K|5.0|This book was amazing. It may just be my favorite by John Green. He's an amazing writer and this book did not disappoint me. I've read his other work before this and I loved it just as much as I've loved his other books.<br /><br />I fell in love with the characters. Especially Ben. He had me laughing through the entire book.<br /><br />It's a great and easy read. Fun. I couldn't put it down once I started!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This book wasn't exactly what I expected but it was certainly an interesting read.  I found myself sneaking in a few pages whenever possible.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|This book is not as good as the last three, as it seems to be a slower pace, but just as captivating with its character development and continued gripping plot lined. This is one of the best book series of all time.
B005N09L5C|2.0|Bad acting, as well as poor video, don't bother with watching this diatribe.<br />Forget it,you will waste your time once finished
B003NS2T9G|5.0|Love it- anything related to Dr Who & w/ Capt Jack in it is a winner in our house! Cheers !
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|i am a fan of anything wizard of oz,Wiz,Wicked, I was not disappointed. The quality of the DVD was splendid.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Very good read. A different take on the Zombie genre . In fact, a different take on novels in general .  Brooks is certainly talented , imaginative , and individualistic . I had problems reading the beginning of the book, but not because it wasn't interesting , it was the short learning curve you must go through , (1-2 segments).  After the assimilation , the book is a must read, and possibly a must reread .
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed this game a lot. Very cleverly done. Would be good for many different aptitude levels. Nice graphics!
B00BMUVW5O|5.0|It's impossible not to be touched by James and Bob's story. You will feel like you want to protect them both....the world is a dangerous place and they are both so fragile...but the alliance of two fragile beings can become an invincible force. This and many other things is what this book is about. James and Bob's story has forced me to confront my prejudices and to discover how many good people there are out there, despite everything - so many people who care, and James and Bob are catalysts for a lot of good will and kindness. Also, nobody can convince me that Bob is just a cat...there is something otherworldly about him! &#34;Who can believe that there is no soul behind those luminous eyes!&#34; ~  &#34;It is difficult to obtain the friendship of a cat. It is a philosophical animal... one that does not place its affections thoughtlessly&#34; - Théophile Gautier on cats
0307740919|1.0|I read Beloved prior to this and admired Morrison's skill with language. (Good prose is far more important to me than a good story.) Home seems like it was written by a different writer, and a novice writer at that. Closer to the quality of an MFA student than a professional author. I couldn't take any more and stopped at about 40 pages in. There were some nice sentences, for sure, but also some that made me cringe. I have no idea what she's up to, but this is weak writing. It's like listening to Stevie Wonder from the late 80s after all those great records he made in the 70s.
034580404X|5.0|I ordered a set of books that were used, good condition...I received new wrapped in plastic books...more that I had expected.  I was hoping that I would get them before leaving on a family vacation but was doubtful because the approximate arrival time was when we would be back from vacation...but to my surprise they arrive within a week of ordering them.  The price, the quality, and the speedy delivery are the reasons for me giving this product 5 stars!!  I would order from them again without a doubt!
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Great show obviously, but my viewing quality was great and I love the convenience of being able to watch it here!
B000GYI32M|4.0|I bought this for my bf because he loves this show and already owned the first 2 seasons. I have to admit, it grows on you.
140006922X|5.0|This is a Scholar who loves history and puts out scholarly work. The Zealot is one of the true and thoroughly researched book that I would recommend to anyone. On Fox TV, a question was very stupidly asked by the interviewer who had not read the book, Why would a muslim be interested in Jesus. The ignorant interviewer did not know that accepting Jesus as prophet of God, is one the basic qualification to be a muslim. A muslim that denies prophethood of Jesus would not be considered a Muslim.
B000I3P3EM|4.0|One of the best I've seen not counting the newer star trek movies that just came out this year and in 2009.
B0051SDM5Q|5.0|really happy I bought it, acutally I did got the salary raise I hoped for, altough I had to modest my request, but the book really helped me understand what is the dinamics I should aspire for.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game.  I like that you rescue and nurse the animals back to health and rele&agrave;se them. Everything is reasonably priced. Not like other games where you pay outrageous amounts to expand or buy things. Great game! I highly reccomend it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Every story needs star-crossed lovers, and this Season 2 has plenty to share.  Get the Kleenex ready for cross-class love, above stairs conflict, and the pain of World War I.  Who  could ask for more?
B003VANOFY|4.0|I bought this headset 8 months ago and it's been FANTASTIC!  I only deducted 1 star for battery life, which is going to be an issue with all wireless products.  I generally get several hours on one charge, thankfully the cord is plenty long so i don't have to stop playing just because the batteries are dead. The Mic has excellent quality and sensitivity.  If you've never had a nice pair of headphones that fit \\"over the ear\\" then make sure you give these bad boys a few days to break in, as you'll likely notice some discomfort in the area just below your EAR, but this subsides once you adjust to wearing a headset. The whole thing is surprisingly lighter than I imagined and there's plenty of padding to make the band rest comfortably against the top of your head.
B009O2XY12|4.0|this game is way better that the other bubble games available in the Amazon store. moves from easy to quite difficult levels. very nicely thought out levels.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Very fun. Kept me up late. Trying to remember the puzzles of my childhood. I think this game to help keep your mind young.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Awesome game... Like it...!!! The &#34;bann-aa-nnaa&#34; character is really cool and this game's a lot of fun to play anytime.
B0000266T2|5.0|Everything I expected it to be and more.  It was just like being in Central Park, front row, at the concert!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|one of the best games yet i have played. the difficulty level is good enough for completing and the missions are reachable, of course, with some efforts. but then that's how a game should be...
140006922X|5.0|Top top book. Christian zealots trying to take this down without reading a page, so here have 5 stars. I have not read a single page either :3
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is much better than the 1st version. the levels are better and the graphics are a tad improved in this second version.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Hosseini has once again written a well-crafted story.  I found the story line a little hard to follow as it shifted between the lives of the many characters.  I did not feel that it had the impact of his two earlier books nor the depth of development he usually has.  Having said this, I did enjoy the book as a window into a troubled part of the world.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|UNO is one of the best card games. However, this version's restricted use through an internet connection limits its rating to 4 for me.<br />it would seem it would get only a rating of 3 in general.
B0069JBKHI|2.0|My brother bough this monitor and I tried it and really liked it.<br />It was a little overprice, but having the iPhone app as an interface was really handy and comfortable.<br /><br />I ordered one for me before our baby arrived and couldn't setup it.<br />I'm kind of a techie and tried several times with several iPhones and iPads and could not get it work.  Also tried contacting customer service, but the manufacturer does not have any contact phone, just an e-mail which I'm still waiting for an answer after three days.  I figured that such a pricey item might have a good customer service, but it doesn't.<br /><br />I will replace it and try a new one.  Hopefully this next one will work.<br /><br />Btw, my brother tripped with the charger cable (kind of short cable, and very ease to trip with) and the his charger broke, It's a mini usb charger, so it's very easy to find a new one, but I've read some other people having the same problem.<br /><br />Once you get it to work, the video quality is very good, the lullabies sound good too and there is a little bit of white noise from the mic.  If it'd really worked for me, or the customer service worked better, I would rate it 4 stars.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I'm a girl, and a phd student<br />I found this book changed some of my perspectives<br />the book touched several questions that worth our time

B000PMLFRA|2.0|I purchased this set and the prequel set because they got better reviews than the all-inclusive set.  Unfortunately, I didn't read any of the reviews beforehand.  These are not the original screen versions.  They are the &#34;updated&#34; versions.  I did a little research online and I could not find the date on which, if ever, the original screen versions will be released on blu-ray.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This is an awesome puzzle game. I am amazed by the way the music sounds and the graphics are great. It is hard enough that it isn't short but isn't hard enough to make you frustrated. I see no questionable material and I am going to continue to play this game for quite some time.

B0040JHWKS|5.0|I hadnt heard of this album yet I am a Springsteen fan...................must of slipped under my radar..............<br />This album is different but iconic Springsteen with a little of old and new in there, almost Darkness on the Edge of Town sounding love most of this album but it has some country feel in it to which I am not a fan but you cannot please everyone all of the time.<br />You wouldnt be dissappointed with some concert songs in there which have not been previously been available in audio format.<br />Do yourself a favour and listen to it not once but three times and you will love it as much as me!<br />I love listening to this album in the car and thinking I am back in my teens!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Great fun, enjoyed the games, but was disappointed with the lack of opposition.  Didn't lose many matches against computer.  Would recommend to anyone who loves magic.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Oh comon.  How can you not love the great special effects and kitschy banter of the 1960'?  Just forget about all the science fiction movies you've seen over the last forty years and Capitan Kirk's adventures are the stuff of legend.
140006922X|5.0|loved the book - heard the writer speak and thought he was a thought-provoking, sensitive, and intelligent human being. Highly recommend this book.

B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I heard about this program on NPR and was curious enough to order Season one.  BIG mistake, I watched the whole season in one week,  I was so amazed on so many levels, I could not stop watching.<br />Now the hard part, withdraw, till Season 2 comes out.
B004YM6JP0|5.0|This season wasn't the best but it was good nonetheless thanks in part to the talented actors especially to Nina Dobrev, Ian Somerhalder and Candice Accola. These 3 I believe made this season cause of the emotional highs and lows their characters experienced and the way they played it to the tee.<br /><br />Recommend for fans of the show and newcomers
1781162646|5.0|Not your usual scary Stephen King., but it was still good and held the attention of the reader.<br />Couldn't put it down.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Well I have played all you have for PC, and I am glad that you have given me this to play on my Droid. At first getting started was misty, but the misy passed fairly quickly as seeing the way each mission is expedited. Still playing so a better review will come.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not the best but as always an enjoyable read.  Ending somewhat predictable it still a good Grisham read.  Can't wait for the next one.
1490313370|5.0|Highly recommended read! The author and his blog are amazing.  He truly breaks it down and his words offer comfort in these scary times.
B00368PSN2|5.0|I ordered 5 different Blu-Ray movies and was told I would receive them within 7 to 10 days, well I got all 5 movies 4 days after I ordered them.  I haven't played them yet, but I have high hopes.  I have never bought a DVD that did not play. I love Amazon!
B009PNQUXO|4.0|The one small thing that should be improved is to download HQ videos, just that small issue, but everything else is 10/10.
B002PEP4C8|4.0|definitely worth reading.  Author takes a topic that is uncomfortable and helps reader to understand what a victim has to deal with in all aspects of life.
B00D2K40WY|3.0|This is amazing you get to dress them my friend can't put it down she loves it and so do I
0920668372|5.0|Love you Forever is a very touching book-I read it on Mothers day at church and there were tears in some people's eyes. It is as much for adults as for children. It is refreshing to read something that makes you think about how families love each other and work together.I first bought this book several years ago when my son had his first child. He still has it. I plan on keeping mine for another grandchild.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|More than I expected.  I've begun watching the series on HBO as well.  Mr. Martin's writing style is amazing.  Descriptive doesn't even scratch the surface.  You become totally immersed from the first page.  Kudos, George.  Looking forward to many more amazing hours absorbed in your work!!!

B003XDXVXO|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of JLo but she does a great job in this film, and of course the leading man is a hottie so that helps as well.  This movie is funny and keeps you entertained and all of the characters, both the main and the supporting, are well written and will keep you laughing at their witty one liners.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I'm dismayed by so many copied-and-pasted near-identical \\"reviews\\" by persons who read a certain commentary at FoxNews.com, so I thought I'd add one that's also from Fox News, but with the author's credentials included:    -------------------------------------    \\"You're a Muslim, so why did you write a book about the founder of Christianity?\\" Fox News' Lauren Green demanded of religious scholar Reza Aslan, author of \\"Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth,\\" on Friday.    Aslan responded, \\"Well, to be clear, I am a scholar of religions with four degrees, including one in the New Testament, and fluency in biblical Greek, who has been studying the origins of Christianity for two decades, who also just happens to be a Muslim.\\"    The answer did not seem to satisfy Green, so Aslan added, \\"Because it's my job as an academic. I am a professor of religion, including the New Testament. That's what I do for a living, actually.\\"    [...]    -------------------------------------    Most folks reviewing this book haven't read it, nor have much in the way of credentials other than a passing familiarity with the Christian Bible, so it's my opinion that Reza Aslan's credentials trump all.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Great soundtrack, package is great and the bonus it came is just medicine to ears<br /><br />Zimmer has proved once again to be the Williams of this era
B00CRS88IO|2.0|The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada is based on an interesting premise, the James Bond author as a Bond type character in WWII, but after a promising start it falls down on the execution.  The book starts as an Alan Furst kind of espionage tale and ends up as a sort of Bond parody.<br /><br />The story begins with Fleming serving in British Naval Intelligence, a position he actually held, in the early days of the war.  The author does a good job establishing the character and setting the stage for his subsequent adventures.  His descriptions of the time, place and characters are detailed and interesting.  Fleming's mission is to ensure that the French fleet doesn't fall into the hands of the Nazis and he's sent to France to try to negotiate with the fleet's commander, Admiral Darlan, to join the British or at the least move the fleet someplace out of the Nazis' reach.<br /><br />When Fleming along with a young British soldier are parachuted into France to meet up with French Resistance fighters things start to move from Furst to Bond territory.  Other reviews have mentioned historical anachronisms particularly regarding the weapons used.  I'm not an expert on the subject but still noticed some fairly glaring examples.  At first I was willing to suspend disbelief but it got increasingly ridiculous as the story went on.  That sums up my feelings about the book in general.  The situations become more outlandish and the characters more cartoonish as the story goes on.  If the author had stayed on the track he started with, i.e., a fairly realistic WWII espionage thriller with a protagonist who happened to later become the Bond author, he could have had a gripping tale with an interesting twist.  In the end, it was at best a second rate Bond imitation.<br /><br />Apart from all of that, the book suffers from lazy writing and sloppy editing, if it was edited at all.  I wonder with a lot of books published in e-versions only.  For example, when Fleming meets the Resistance one character is named as Rene and a few paragraphs later he becomes Raoul which he remains.  In a British naval attack, the same ship is sunk in consecutive paragraphs with slightly different descriptions.  And while the dialog is almost entirely in English, naturally, the author occasionally has the characters' dialog written in French or German.  Bad German.  Grammatically incorrect and sometimes completely incomprehensible.  And those are the Germans speaking.<br /><br />At least the book was cheap and short.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book spoke to me in ways Young Adult books haven't in years. I thought it was funny, touching, and horribly sweet. But not so sweet that it gave me diabetes. For all of those saying that the way that Augustus and Hazel spoke isn't how teens spoke missed the whole point. Of course teens without cancer or some serious illness do not speak that way. Augustus and Hazel and Issac for that matter spoke that way because they HAD to grow up quickly. The whole reason that Hazel's friend even exists is to point that out to the reader. While teens are faking adult hood these sick, amazing kids are just trying to feel some semblance of normality.<br /><br />I thank John Green for writing a book that is seeped in reality for the YA genre.
0062280228|3.0|I've been a big Neil Gaiman fan ever since I first read Neverwhere years ago. (I'm still hoping for a sequel.)  I've read most of what he has written and loved most of it including the stories aimed at younger audiences such as Coraline and Mirror Mask. I would say that this is the first book or story of his I have read that I think is just \\"OK\\". I've come to expect a certain quality and atmosphere from a Neil Gaiman story. I love the deep sense of macabre, the dark humor and the interesting and well developed characters. I didn't get that in this book. If I had read this story without knowing the author I would never have guessed he had written it. The book almost seemed like Neil Gaiman trying to write a Charles De Lint book and not quite getting it.<br /><br />Not to say the story was bad. It was just OK. The characters were reasonably developed but I didn't really find them engaging as I usually do from Mr. Gaiman's works. The mythological world was not really well developed in my opinion and almost seemed kind of shallow. The plot was OK but not particularly gripping or engaging.  In short it was a kind of cute fairy tale with a slight sense of macabre.<br /><br />I wouldn't say you should avoid the book but, sad to say, I think there is a heck of a lot better fantasy out there, such as the other books and stories by Mr. Gaiman.

B009XIXVU6|2.0|This book was an overall disappointment for me.  I thought that the Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns were two of the best books I have ever read, but this one was a confusing array or character profiles.  When I finished the first reading, I actually went back and re-read it documenting the characters on a sheet of paper.  I wanted it to be another stella work.
B0061QD82E|5.0|I purchased this movie classic to watch with my family during family time. I received the product in a timely manner and the condition of the excellent. I am truly pleased with this product and I would purchase from this seller in the future should an opportunity arise.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|Good cinematography, acting, and concept though a little confusing at times.  Being that the story unfolds over the course of 500 years it's somewhat a given that plot would be scattered about.  If you have the ability to pay careful attention to details you'll enjoy this movie but don't go into it half-heated or you'll miss a lot!
1451695195|5.0|For years I've believed that when a person dies, that's it;  dust to dust, ashes to ashes.  But after reading Eben Alexander's Proof of Heaven, I'm a believer!  There have been many others who have experienced life after death, then come back to tell about it.  This is the first time I read about one man's experience of the afterlife.  It's a very scientifically and technically written book, and after reading it, I started talking about it.  I've had several people, including my own dad, tell me of the same experience that Alexander had.  This is a wonderful book, very well-written.  I highly recommend it.
B000002JSJ|4.0|So..... Many slam this album for odd reasons. The band was on tax holiday, Robert had a broken leg, they rushed, etc... etc. Yes the band faced a fair amount of adversity during this time. Maybe their foundation was a little shaky. But they approached this album as a band. They intended to do it quickly from the start. They intended to keep it kinda stripped down. They knew they were having a hard time in various ways, as a band, and as individuals. So instead of going epic in scale, they respectfully decided to just pound out a straight ahead stripped down rock and roll album. There is not one thing wrong with that approach. The playing is killer, Robert is not a lifeless as some claim, the lack of keyboards is not a crime. They are just doing to the four piece rock band thing. Awesome in my opinion! I think it's great it's great to have this album representing this point in their career. They had reached so many inventive heights in the studio previously. Always besting themselves. And here they scale it all down. But you still end up with my favorite Led Zeppelin song....the epic Achilles Last Stand. And the nearly as epic, Nobody's Fault But Mine. For Your Life is a killer jam, as evidenced by it's first live unveiling at the reunion concert. Hots On For Nowhere is am fun little song that really showcases some nice Bonham licks and shows that things weren't all dismal for them.  Royal Orleans kinda sums up the whole Munich basement studio vibe and has really good interplay between Bonham and Page. Tea For One is in my opinion their best blues effort ever.  And Candy Store Rock might be the weakest track of the album, but is still very strong. The little groove changes in that song are really cool. And it has a very live feel to it.<br /><br />So I don't quite walk away from it with the lackluster feeling that many have ascribed to this album. I have been a huge Zeppelin fan since I was a kid in the 70s. And I have enjoyed every bit of their music. But as I get older and frankly get a little worn out by the radio standards, I find myself digging into the last three albums. And of those last three albums I dig into Presence the most. I guess there are two types of Zeppelin fans. There are those who only get into things like Stairway To Heaven, Whole Lotta Love, Black Dog, Kashmir, and the other radio staples. And there are those like myself who dig into each and every bit of it with the same enthusiasm. But if you are hesitant about this album, don't be. Buy it. Put on some good headphones (not ear buds), and lay back and really listen. It has truckloads of vibe to it. You can sense some of the difficulties the band was facing. And you can also see that they still had a huge sense of adventure musically.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|The music, the actors play, the decorations and the plot - it's just great!!!<br />Can recommend to anyone (over 16yeo)
B00846REIS|5.0|I have read some of Sylvia Days historical romances and I thought they were awesome  but these contemporary ones are fantastic I cannot wait to read the next book in this series. Eva and Gideon are so messed up they belong together. It makes me think that they could not be happy without each other. They both have major problems. But it seems they are almost the same problems. But since they know there problems they seem to work on them together. Yes I think that's why they are perfect together
B001BWQVSG|5.0|This woman certainly does have interpretive soul. Her playing is magnificent. I've been listening to a lot of piano music lately, Richter, Rubinstein, Moravec, Horowitz, Serkin, Arrau, Uchida, Ohlsson, Perahia etc. and you know what? When I started listening to Argerich I had to put the others away. I can't stop. This woman is special. Her music is special. I'm now on a quest to listen to everything she ever recorded. Beautiful, incredible performances.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is what a super hero movie should be. The cream of marvels heavy hitters on the big screen. Good to see the hulk in form ans steals some great scenes. Funny thrilling and a great story amonst jaw dropping special effects.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|I read this book in my school class and it was a great book. Defiantly a older book but good!
B005S9EKCW|4.0|well directed film of musical. Well acted and a deserved oscar performance from a leading lady. A film you have to see.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Being a medical professional, I enjoyed the science-based point of view of the author.  This book answered some questions for me about how it is possible for the soul to reside in the mind (it is not), and how consciousness (or spirit) is outside the body.  I have read several books about heaven, and was fascinated by the new perspective.
B002ZG9968|5.0|I had to own this for my DVD library, It was an excellent movie, cute and funny and common sense too.
1401324649|3.0|goes on way too long.  The historical allusions and the plot coincidences are fun at first, but get repetitive and less amusing about half way through the book.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I had very low expectations of this show. My friend had recommended it about a year ago and I didn't bite ~ I saw the commercials and thought it looked cheesy. The CGI for the aliens isn't top notch, but they're working on a tv budget so it's understandable. That's about all I didn't like. You can get behind the characters, and while some of the storyline can be a tiny bit predictable here and there, it's overall very engaging. I tore through the first season in a matter of three days, and eagerly moved on to season 2.
B0018QOIXU|2.0|I thought I ordered Adele's 21 CD, and received 19 instead.  I didn't complain about it and bought the 21 CD at a store.

B007N85POS|5.0|This is a good game. I play it way too much but enjoy every minute of it. Good job people!
B003CFBQBW|3.0|It is okay, I personally like the soundtrack to the first Twilight movie but it is representative of the third movie
044024613X|4.0|This book reminded me of a John Grisham novel. It almost seems that a sequel could be written to continue on with Andy's story.
B0032O6S4I|4.0|My son Loves this set, he loves animals, we set kit up on a large table, it is quite long when it is put together, some of the pieces were hard to snap in
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a good story that is not predictable. Noah Wiley is great in this as the father of three boys he's trying to keep together in a crazy time. The special effects are awesome!
B001ED7C58|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this !!!!Muse &#34;Supermassive Black Hole&#34; is sensational(Love them), &#34;spotlight&#34; is a great running song, I actually use alot of the music on this to run to, but absolutely love &#34;Bella's Lullaby&#34;
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it. A fast read, which continually held my attention! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys an action read.
B0029O08WA|4.0|Loved this one becaus of&#34;Possibility&#34; and &#34;Meet me on the Equinox&#34; also love anything by MUSE, &#34; Done All wrong&#34; is good too.
B00607EWYC|5.0|Some books remind you that everything is singular--about one thing, really, no matter how many times that one thing is refracted or modified or how many songs we sing to distract ourselves from the dominance of it. For this novel, at least the way it left me, everything is about death. While that was devastating, I wasn't completely without hope. The salvation of this novel came in almost silent moments, like Howard looking over the plate-glass surface of the pond, the mercy of a new life, the developing of callouses to stave off what pains the innocent once suffered, and money stuffed in lock boxes all over town--moments of particular resonance because they, like Howard, are submerged in the darkness of the inevitable. Good bye is the last word of the novel--I hope that I haven't given too much away--and the word felt heavy when I read it, a groundswell of significance now plump in its ebbing.
B004P7CNE0|1.0|If a cartoony conflation of Fahrenheit 451, 1984, THX 1138 with special effects and art direction cribbed from The Matrix appeals to you, then have at it. Christian Bale is a great actor and here is sadly wasted in this pastiche of much better films and literary sources. Ditto Emily Watson, Sean Bean and Taye Diggs. This is as hollow a movie as can be made on a fairly large budget and no more than a by the numbers and for the money effort.<br /><br />The plot, such as it is, concerns a post WW3 society where emotion has been outlawed as a way of controlling the population and ensuring peace. So in order to ensure that no emotion is expressed all artwork, puppies, music, color, freedom, etc has been outlawed. To enforce these laws the population are forced to take emotion supressing drugs and a police force with shoot to kill authorization is employed to eliminate anyone without purely Vulcan emotional control. These uber policemen also have some sort of special emotion detecting power and employ a form of martial arts involving the ability to shoot and kill dozens of people without getting scratched themselves. A sort of \\"gun fu\\" if you will. Plenty of Matrix like special effects are used and of course the elite police wear black dusters just like Neo! Yay! Christian Bale is one of these uber cops, one of the best actually and he decides without much prompting to stop taking his emotion supressing drugs and the games begin. Sound familiar? It should. What was immediately apparent to me was that if all emotion has been supressed why is everyone dressed in black, why is the leader surrounded by armed guards and protected by a glass cube when talking even tho he is a hologram? Why is murdering the population considered peaceful? Why is it that characters who supposedly are emotion free consistantly express negative emotions? If everyone is on emotion suppressing drugs why would you need to ban artwork in the first place? If noone can react to it, who cares if it exists? Oh forget it, logic is not this idiotic movies strong point.? Oh forget it, logic is not this idiotic movies strong point.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great book. The ending is wonderful. Its written well. Definitely worth the price in my opinion. :)
140006922X|5.0|We live by stories...its the way of humans, but often those stories have far separated from any grounding in fact. People get upset when facts intrude on the story. This book does a wonderful job of helping separate the facts of Jesus time and life, from the fiction of the religious story. Aslan does a great job saying that one can look at facts and still have faith in the story of Jesus. It is readable and intelligent. I hope we see more such efforts around all kinds of \\"stories\\" that serve to divide us...
B0046B3QTG|4.0|Despicable me is a good movie that is very enjoyable.  The ending is predictable but the antics of the minions make up for any short comings.
B002L5KKK2|4.0|I had to rent this for a class I'm taking. I didn't think I would like it, but it turned out to be a good movie!
B00BH0VSM6|3.0|Not organized. Jumps around without warning clues. Good plot though. Don't think I will be reading this author again. If you read it good luck.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Very well cast movie! It has all the elements for a memorable movie; great characters that stand on their own, very well scripted, and a storyline that strings it all along. I really liked it. Great action spy comedy romp!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Fans of sci-fi, dystopian fiction or simply fantastically well crafted story telling, you've just discovered your next good read! Tense, haunting, foreboding, suspenseful, by turns action packed and philosophical, inventive, imaginative, fresh, Wool will hook you in its first pages & not let go. A thoroughly & thoughtfully conceived vision of humankind teetering on the brink. Ending this review to start book 2!
B00A2DIW3C|5.0|Well written book about the history of Skunk Works.  Walks you through Ben Rich's career there and give you a behind the scene look at how the experimental military aircraft development process works.

B00COGXGNQ|1.0|This movie is lame, I didn't watch it but I didn't need to. I can tell this movie is a chick flick because my wife was the one that rented it.<br /><br />In all fairness, this isn't a real review.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|I've enjoyed watching this movie many times. Glad I finally found it for sale. It's one of my favorite musicals.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|There's nothing like a good twist. Excellent script-reminiscent of David Lynch- but.much better.<br />I needed to see the last episode twice to make sure I understood the ending.<br />Looking forward to AHS: Coven
B000GPIPD8|5.0|This is my favorite album of theirs yet! I like all of their albums but this one takes the cake by far! I HIGHLY recommend this album to anyone wanting to seriously ROCK!
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I learned many facts about this period in American history.<br />Not your shoot-em-up movie but serious topic. It's no wonder that Daniel Day Lewis received the best actor award.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|Everything these guys make seems to be golden. I enjoy all of their albums. This particular album is still growing on me.... This is not my fav album of theirs but a very strong album nonetheless. Yes, I do recommend this album.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Interesting view into how things were in England in the early 1900s.  Aristocracy at its finest and worst.  We enjoy watching.
B0014QABX0|5.0|Killer stuff!!! These guys ROCK!!! This is a very easy album to listen to and enjoy no matter the mood or state of mind.

B000002GYR|5.0|If you like Tom Waits, you should fall in love with this album. This is a &#34;classic&#34; album of timeless pieces of work. You can't go wrong with this. Enjoy!
B005NFWCSK|3.0|Much better than the last 2 X Men movies. This reboot of sorts takes us back to the 1960s, giving us the origins of Magneto and Dr. Xavier, along with the other key characters. Good performances and writing make this one of the better superhero movies of the last few years.
B0015KO52S|4.0|I totally digg Jack White and his unique style of rock/music. I have another album by these guys and like it LOTS. This one is still growing on me though. It's good rock n' roll that's for sure!
B0036TGSJ4|4.0|I have a home theater, it plays in my home theater... The only downside is the number of attached previews (I began skipping them at 3), it really makes you feel like you are in a theater with all the previews. Otherwise, what is there to complain about? Its a movie on a disk.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|My 7-year-old son says, \\"I wish I could give this game 1000 stars. It's the best game I have ever played.\\" He is literallhy screaming as I type because of something new has done on the game. Great game!
B005HSL626|3.0|A way to pass time while dropping a deuce.  Will also suffice as a way to ignore the person in front of you in line to use the john.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|So much fun! One of the best games I've downloaded so far, and it is free! Much better than some of the ones I've paid for.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|AccuRadio has several &#34;channels&#34; or &#34;stations&#34; based on a genre of music.  Each station has &#34;sub-stations&#34; that play a more specific genre of music.  It randomly chooses a song within this genre.  If there is a band you don't like in this genre, you can block it.  If there is a song you don't like, give it a bad rating and you won't hear it again.<br /><br />Why is it better than Pandora?  Rating system uses a five star scale allow for more accurate rating of a sound.  New music is more readily available; by that I mean there a stations dedicated to new music.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I seriously think that this should be the app of the year.It's so epic and fun to play you scrunched up your own kind like Die Humans lol
B008EKMB82|5.0|I liked the concepts presented, like &#34;up from up is down and down from down is up&#34;, right? I never thought about it before, plus a good story well written.
B00AESN8XY|3.0|The game was great and really fun and good dlc but most of the gameplay cost money and that is why I give it a 3 out of 5

B004XDYJRU|2.0|The reason to get Pro is to access recordings. But this function is completely broken in the current version.<br /><br />There are two main problems: fast forwarding through recordings and battery drain.<br /><br />Fast forwarding was removed in a recent update and only just put back in. But the functionality is still broken. You can't sensibly fast forward, you can only stick your finger along the bar at approximately where you think you want to be. But that could be 20-30 minutes away from where you want to be. And it takes so long to start playing that trying to get it closer to where you want is a thankless task. As a matter of urgency, we need buttons to rewind 10 minutes and forward 10 minutes to complement the existing &#34;rewind 10 seconds&#34; button.<br /><br />And this app sucks down the battery, even when it's doing nothing! If you pause while playing back a recording, it continues to chew through the battery as if you were still playing it. This is ridiculous, as you often need to pause a long recording; you certainly don't want to &#34;stop&#34; it because, as detailed above, it'll take you forever to get back to where you were beforehand.<br /><br />These bugs need to be fixed URGENTLY, please.

B00D6B4PUG|1.0|I have no need for Gmail.  I prefer to receive all of my email in one place.  It is easier to keep track.
B004GYY714|5.0|Works great!  Easy to use.  Listen to stations all over the country, excellent reception.  Create favorites list.  Highly recommended app.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love twitter.  It allows me to read about people that I have high regard for.  I sometimes send messages to others on twitter.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Works well, would like more creative selections but it is worth the trial to see if you would like it.
B00C5GZKVQ|2.0|I guess since I am not a &#34;gamer&#34; and not male, this game eluded me. I downloaded it by mistake really. I  tried several times to play it but I just could not really understand how the guns worked. It seems I managed only to blow up the kitchen. I really needed to shoot down something too as I am very stressed out. If you are familiar with these types of games I suspect it will be easy for you. The graphics were pretty good. But I uninstalled it. I am almost 60 and definitely not a boy. But I still like to shoot things (non-living things thank you) down. I was hoping this would be something different I  could have played.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Easy to use.  Very useful when traveling, runs in background.  Highly recommended for anyone who travels with their Kindle or just needs an alarm clock.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Works awesome, saves so much time typing and it corrects most of the spelling mistakes you have.. It can even predict what I'm going to type. Great app.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|You have to love this quirky group of nerds and their antics.  Sheldon is my favorite.  Who would have thought that a show about nerdy scientists would be soooooooo great!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|A good book, full of surprises making a thought provoking read. I do not read a lot of books as time is short, however I am pleased I read this one. I recommend this book to anyone and will now check out the authors other books.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great legal drama with good sub plots that fit with the overall story. Gabriel Macht is very convincing. Excellent - five stars
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|You either like this film because you're a parent with a child with no sense of a good story or you're a child. I like many Disney movies because they often have fantastic plot, humor, cleverness, and comes with a message. This movie provides none of that. The actors sounds fake, the jokes are boring, the plot is predictable; there's nothing to like here. Please stop supporting films like this.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|It locks up constantly on my Kindle Fire.  I couldn't do any posts on Saturday because it couldn't &#34;confirm my location&#34;.  Not terribly pleased.

B00AVFO41K|5.0|This game is alot of fun.  I play it all the time and I am improving each time I play it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I first got th his for my kids but I'm so addicted to it! I can't help the feeling of wanting my horse to be the very best. So I'm constantly doing everything to improve all the stats.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast is a big product in a small package. The YouTube and Netflix apps work great. Actually the ease of how it works with my phone, tablet, and laptop pushed me to purchase a subscription to Netflix.
B0089LOG02|5.0|The story is wonderful, but I could not recommend it to my teenage children or grandchildren due to the bad language used,  I feel words  could have been changed and the story would have been just as effective by better language.
B006N0YWGY|1.0|not a game that I can describe as fun to learn or master.  tried on Kindle fire and after multiple attempts....dumped it.
B003U4ZQUM|3.0|Just way out there!too much! Not sure how to describe I just wanted them to get to whatever and end it
B00821PCJS|5.0|not speilberg quality,,,but still a good series.  I'm on season 3 and will continue to watch it as long as it lasts.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|Quintessential Le Carre'; except for his extraordinary talent for telling a tale one gets the feeling he has told this tale before and has changed the names and locations to unintentionally(of course) protect his royalties. I enjoyed the tale but it may be one novel too far.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|very convenient for shopping trips and quick answers when needed when you need a calculator.  I like it and will use it.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Great Series that I wished wasn't canceled after only one season.  The movie was a very nice touch for the fans though
B00BB8UJKG|5.0|This movie was very entertaining. A great cast and a storyline that was light and deep at the same time. I would recommend this film.
B001BANK32|5.0|this book is so good I though the movie was good but this book is so much better it left me on the edge of my seat the whole time and towards the end. was biting my nails I was so anxious
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|I love games! But not this game.  While the controls were easy to use (on my Kindle Fire), the game play blows.  Its just boring.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|this is a great app that I have been recommending to friends. it's easy to use and keeps on track. the great thing about it is if you're needing to read a passage in a different translation, its simple to do so. as to the running in the background and permission &quot;hog&quot;? haven't  seen or experienced evidence of slowing down or &quot;spam&quot; from 3rd party sources.
B0055D3EFU|5.0|as a lover of true scary movies i can say that this is a truly creepy movie; not just gory trying to pass as scary. hubby and i both loved this movie!
B005H9B44A|4.0|This movie was as fast of a pace movie as it could be from the beginning. The pace kept right on up to the very end.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is my favorite game to play to pass the time. I just found that you can customize the backs of the cards so now I get to play with a deck of cards that has custom art from my five year old. It makes it even more enjoyable.
0812983459|5.0|Touching and endearing story.  Interesting characters and great plot.  Enjoyed very much.  Couldn't put it down.Will recommend to all my friends.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|It isn't as good as the original but overall it got the job done with kick ass action and humor. Chuck Norris hobbling out at 9000 years old with that awful rug was worth the ticket price.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Great. Book! Keeps the story moving with no pauses- didn't want to put it down....if you liked his other books your sure to like this one...
068981528X|5.0|This \\"backwards fairy tale\\" is not only hilarious, it has a great message within it-- Strongest isn't always best, sometimes beauty conquers the beast, and a bully can become a friend. Your kids will giggle and want to read it over and again.
B008P9M614|5.0|For the price, you cannot beat the value. 130 hours of top notch, intriguing television with characters who endear themselves to you. A must have for puzzle loving drama watchers.
B003EEMIV8|5.0|This toy is great.  My son is in heaven playing with this toy.  He loves that it has actual working features.  I did find that when you go to dump the trash, if you pull it all the way back, it does sometimes stick and is really hard for him to push it back down.  I had to do it for him and I was worried I was going to break the toy.  He has had so much fun playing with this and the other Bruder toys he has.  The are larger then other vehicles he has gotten - which becomes a space problem, but they are made very well and have true to real life features.  After playing with this toy, he has added a ton more Bruder vehicles to his wish list.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This the best game ever and funny it's so cool and nice like the movie  and the minions look like them
B002I0J5FG|2.0|Never played either of these on the PS2, but i bought the HD Beyond Good and Evil for the PS3 so I thought these two would be great, given all the accolades. Spent like 19 bucks on it used, and feel RARARA-RIIIIIPPPED OFF! Ico is just plain bad. There isn't a single fun aspect about it. SOC is better, but jeez, that's like saying a D- is better than an F.<br /><br />If you've played these two, why are you even reading this? Your mind is made up...go for it man...if not, heed this warning...<br /><br />Cons<br />---------<br />(-) Controls are ass, just plain clunky<br />(-) Graphics are bland, boring, and often down right ugly, and that's by last gen (xbox, dreamcast, PS2) standards.<br />(-) Story is just, seriously starts interestingly enough, but once you realize what the game is, something you will realize in like 10 minutes, you won't care. You'll just be mad at how gay the game is.<br />(-) Ico, I don't understand. It's established that most people HATE escort missions. They're annoying and you just try to get through them to get back to the real game. Ico is nothing but one long escort mission.<br />(-) Ico A.I. is broken, that stupid B***** doesn't do what you tell her, she's always dying or making you back track to get her because her AI is so bad it won't follow. God...I hate this terrible game<br />(-) Colossus - is much better, but should be a 5 dollar download. Graphics are ugly, PS2 they may have been passable, but even with the HD treatment, you're looking at a middling PS2 title.<br /><br />Pros<br />----<br />(+) some of the collosus are kind of cool I guess.<br /><br />Bottom line. These games are only for those who played them, and have some happy nostalgia associated with them. Sadly, neither held up over time. Ico is so bad it's unplayable, and it's lame boredom inducing game play will get a capitulation from even the most strident of completists. If you are curious and have disposable cash and still feel compelled to buy, LOWER YOUR EXPECTATIONS (I mean like a lot.), you have been warned.S (I mean like a lot.), you have been warned.

B00CEZJT2E|5.0|This battery is great for someone on the go or who prefers to not be tied to a wall outlet.  Especially in today's age when smartphones barely last a day this is a must so that you are never stranded without a charged phone.<br /><br />Description:<br />The battery came in the packaging with an instruction manual, a small cord with a usb output on one end and a micro-usp output on the other, and an iphone charger adapter that plugs into the micro usb. The battery is a little larger than my Droid Razr M and I am guessing it is a little smaller than the Samsung Galaxy for a comparison. It is also slightly heavier than my phone.<br /><br />When I received this battery it was at 3 bars so I charged it fully to 4 and started charging devices until it emptied. Here are the results:<br /><br />3 hours 50 min to charge Droid Razr from 0-100% - Dropped to 2 lights just as the charge finished<br />2 1/2 hours to charge ipod touch 3rd gen from 0-100% - Dropped to 1 light 10 min before charge finished<br />1 1/2 hours to charge Droid Razr M from 23% to 91% - Charged until dead<br /><br />The battery sizes of these devices are:<br />Razr - 1780mAh<br />iPod - 1030mAh<br />Razr M - 2000mAh * .68 (amount charged) = 1360<br /><br />Which means this battery supplied 4350mAh of 6000mAh before it died<br />Adding an extra 10% (which is very generous) accounting for the power of operating the devices during charging brings the supplied mAh to 4785.  This means there was a loss of 1215 mAh which is not too bad but I would like it to be a bit better.  However, some of this may be due to the fact that it was the chargers first use.  I will redo these tests as soon as I can and update my review if the numbers are significantly different.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Size: This battery easily fits into your pocket so it is no huge burden to carry.<br />Built in micro-usb cable: It doesn't require you to carry extra wires with you throughout the day.<br />2 outputs: the ability to charge 2 devicesat once is very nice<br />Power: The battery supplies a decent charge and is powerful enough to charge most smartphones 2 - 2.5 times<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />No wall charger: Not a big deal since most people have a usb wall charger but still a small inconvenience to those who don't.<br />Heat: Yesterday while charging my phone the battery started to get relatively warm. Not a huge issue but worth mentioning. It would probably happen with any external battery.<br /><br />*Edited to remove a comment about phone compatibility as commented by another user.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This season of Downton Abbey was a small comedown from the previous season's froth. There was a lot here to keep a busy viewer occupied, especially the massive shake-ups that occurred in the cast. I enjoyed the season's overall theme of the inevitability of change and the simultaneous need to honor tradition. The cast is excellent, of course. UK actors just seem to have the innate capability to speak these scripts beautifully.<br /><br />I'd recommend to any fan of the series, though I'd also recommend anyone just getting into Downton Abbey to start at the beginning to get the best flavor of the times.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Book was easy to read, easy to follow, but I kept waiting for something big to happen and it never really did. It gives you a lot of build up for what you think will be something spectacular and that just never happened. In the end, it's still an ok book to read if you want an easy read for a week.
140006922X|5.0|Brilliant scholarship binds history, faith and unique perspective. The criticism of this writer and implications of his having an agenda are ignorant.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game my boyfriend and I have been playing it for an hour and having fun with it strongly recommend this game
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This wonderful story is not one where you sit, and watch it like it is eye candy. Nor is it one that you can let your mind stray away from it.<br /><br />It engulfs you totally to be there, not in your living room, not in a theator. It's full, and rich, you believe all the characters are real.<br /><br />I believe you have to really get into this movie with all of you.It's not just entertainment,it's in its' way magical,fantasy, yet it is real.<br /><br />If you are not into paying attention, and want only to be tickled then do not watch this movie. But if you want a full journey into many thoughts, ideas, and more, enjoy!<br /><br />Debilyn in Oregon watched on Amazon

1781162646|5.0|I am a passionate reader of King's novels.<br /><br />As soon as I got the book, I descended this world of carny, a totally new entry for my personal experience.<br />Carny has always made me shiver, in a way I cannot explain, and Joyland captures the essence of my fears.<br />In his latest novel King creates a mix of pranormal activity and crime, and you don't see the light until the very end. A perfect crime story with thrilling and spooky elements that mingle together in this masterpiece. A novel full of ghostly presence, childish moments, thunderous moments.
B008Q0AJA2|5.0|This is a great example of how Jim Carrey can not only do silly comedy but show real acting ability. It's a heartful touching story as well as being very funny. Highly recommended
B005EVVESM|5.0|Wonderful CD I play this in my car all the time. I really love this CD This a  CD that you do not tire of. Good listening music.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|I really felt bad for the kids.  Their parents were silly and stupid.  The author made the story hang together well,  I thought.  What else can I say?  I recommend it as interesting and something different.  The book was well planned out.  The characters were realistic.  The boy somehow made it through to wholeness inspite of the quirky adults around him.  Canada was distant is miles and scope.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|This is one of my favorite of Maroon 5. There is not a song that I don't like on this CD. A great CD!! I received two by mistake and I gave it to my son and if he did not like it he would ask my grandchildren or one of his co-works that had been to see Maroon 5. Love this CD!
B0056CUZRA|4.0|A great story of life before and during world War 1. About a blending of rich and poor families and the difference between their lives as they are affected by the impact of war. If you are old enough it will bring back memories of living conditions at the time which you may have experienced as children. Although only a novel it contains many real situations.
B00AYB0YFQ|1.0|I know this was a parady but could not keep my interest.  I never finished the movie, wasn't keeping our attention.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|The complete version added a lot of new scenes to help tie in the storyline which would be extremely helpful for people like my wife who had no clue what was going on.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|Khaled Hosseini is a master storyteller of enormous proportions, as those of us who've read any of his past novels already know. He spins a well crafted yarn that draws the reader in with ease, gently dropping one heart breaking tale after another, then leaving us with empty anticipation for neat, happy resolutions that never appear. And the Mountains Echoed does not disappoint. It reads pleasantly and with little effort, like honey dripping from a jar. Anybody looking for a long, enjoyable book that will keep them eager to read the next page will find this tome to be a solid choice.<br /><br />The novel takes place in several places: Afghanistan, Greece, France and the United States. It also skips back and forth in time some, but the author is kind enough to point out the current year in each chapter's heading. Hosseini paints beautiful images wherever he takes us, and the details in the settings alone make this book worth the read. Every scene has its own ambience, with specific sounds and scents that conjure lovely or dismal stages. It takes very little imagination on the reader's part to feel and see his descriptions, they're so vivid and well thought out.<br /><br />In an apparent effort to stray from the less than flattering image Afghanistan currently enjoys in the West, Hosseini mostly steers clear from talk of the Taliban He speaks very little of terrorism in general, for that matter. Yet a good portion of the novel takes place in post September 11 Afghanistan. The result is a less skewed view of a volatile region than the one we tend to get in the media, which is a refreshing change. Despite all the violence that is taking place there, most Afghans continue to live their lives one day at a time, doing what they need to get by. It's fairly easy to lose sight of that when you're merely peeking in from the outside.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this book and I highly recommend it to others.
B00C28J2VQ|1.0|I held out quite a bit of hope for this movie after the first one literally blew me away; however, I found the technology in the movie to be 50 years back from what it was in the first - I felt like I was watching at best a 20 year old action flick for the first half of the movie; I knew I was watching a 20 year old action flick when they threw Bruce Willis into the mix.  The movie was extremely boring, the characters were shallow, and the plot point seemed weak.  Don't waste your time & don't waste your money.  This movie has zero replay value.  Go watch the first one and maybe one day they'll come up with another movie deserving of the title \\"G.I. Joe\\".
B001BKVWYG|4.0|First, see the amazing  DVD &#34;Searching for Sugarman.  Then you will know why you need this record of a musician who is bigger than Elvis Presley in South America, but unknown in his own America.

B009XIXVU6|3.0|This  book had many different characters weaving in and out , and you never learned what happened to them and how they related to the main story.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Classic Bruce Willis action with some great characters and a plot that is more than blow everything up and kill everyone the explosions didn't get.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Great movie, the villain was cool but could have been better, waiting for #3 to come out on Blu Ray

B002RPR6DU|5.0|The little robot drones are hilarious & so adorable! Their interactions with Bruce Dern are amazing! The eco message is timeless & makes this story current for our times as well as when this movie was made. Anyone who is a SciFi, OuterSpace &/or Eco-conservation enthusiast will love this film! Take a lesson humanity!!
B00101ZOTA|5.0|Never heard of this movie till a week ago. Watched it, and it was great. You really don't expect the ending, which is awesome. It's a great movie that's not new but still thrilling to watch. Very cool.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A great way to pass the time...it is fun and addictive. The challenges are great too. It is a great way to kill time on a plane or a bus.<br />Definitely worth getting.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|THis book cycled through our family and generated lively conversations.  The first few chapters were heartbreaking and caused some author dislike initially by our 12 year old...must say he redeemed himself.  Can't wait to start the next book.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|SPOILERS<br />Ok, right off the bat lets just say I think all the bad reviews were unnecessary. This book was not my favorite in the series, but then again the last one in a series rarely is.<br />My favorite is probably Delirium, but then again there were some great moments in Pandemonium. I love Lauren Oliver, and she definitely is one of my favorite authors. I loved the transition between Hana and Lena, even though at certain points I was skimming the pages just to get back to Lena. It definitely gives you great insight on the inside of the walls, just as well as the outside.<br /><br />Spoilers ahead<br /><br />Lena has definitely developed throughout these books and I loved that. Seeing her change really makes me feel as though I am seeing through her eyes. She transforms from this obedient innocent girl to a woman who stands up for what's right and will kick some butt if you hurt those she loves. She is now strong and independent, while still being sensitive and loving. She now understands the world is full of lies, and you must find the truth among it all.<br />One of the clearest points in Pandemonium was: The past is dead. She did abide by that rule for a long time... Until Alex returned. She can't run anymore, and memories start to resurface. I love Alex. I really, honestly do. He is a great character, and like  many other books, I find myself crying in the end because the book is over and he's not actually real. When Delirium ended and Alex \\"died\\" BOOM Julian shows up. Many readers were horrified at the idea of Lena loving another. I was one of them. Yet, the more I got to know him, the more I loved him. And then Alex comes back from the dead. Readers also didn't  like the idea of a love triangle but the book would be incomplete without it. And, what can I say, I'm a sucker for love triangles.<br /><br />Now, in one of the first scenes, Alex and Lena are alone in the woods. Lena attempts to apologize for falling for Julian. He tells hers he never loved her, and he still doesn't. That scene right there, ripped my heart out. I set the book down, and cried and cried until I was soaked and I was all dried up.<br /><br />Lena has proven, life is hard in the Wilds and freedom comes with a price. Food can be scarce, water can be as well, shelter isn't so easy to come by, and survival in general is a huge challenge.<br /><br />Hana on the other hand, has got what she considers, a great life. She is soon to marry Fred Hargrove, the mayor of Portland. He's rich, sweet, good looking, and smart. She thinks everything is perfect. Then, she begins to crumple with guilt. I honestly. Could. Not. Believe. She. Was. The. One. Who. Told. On. Alex. And. Lena. Anyways, after that heartbreaking shocker, she figures out life isn't so good. Fred is evil, and cruel, and a killer.<br /><br />As far as Julian and Alex are concerned,  who I would have chosen would be Alex. I was just drawn to him. Although, I did love Julian too and telling him I loved Alex more would have broken my heart. So I was split pretty evenly until that scene with Alex at the beginning when he said he didn't love Lena. That made me realize how much I loved him and there was no comparison between the two anymore. I just hadn't realized it until then. I was very happy to find Lena felt the same way, and Alex eventually confessed he lied and he REALLY does love Lena.<br /><br />When the end of the book comes, I was on the edge of my seat. Lena found Grace, had declared her love for Alex (and vice versa thank God) Hana had left Fred to die, Raven had died, they had taken down Portland, Julian is totally oblivious to the fact of what had happened with Lena and Alex, and everyone is tearing down the wall that separated the Wilds and Portland. Then it ends. Right there. At first I could see why readers were upset. Then I realized Lauren was letting you draw your own conclusion. You could decide what happens. No author has really had the guts to do this before (that I know of) and she really put herself out there. She was being brave with her writing, and a brave author is the best author. I admire her for this and I think this was a beautiful series with great lessons, humor, heartbreak, betrayal, standing up for what's right, and overall love.) and she really put herself out there.

B0068RHSCW|5.0|I rarely watch new movies as they are so horrid.  I like Daniel Craig and was impressed with his presence in this movie. There are some interesting reality checks that make us question the nature of reality.  I thought the psychological inferences were well done.  It captured my attention for the duration, although some of it is mediocre in comparison to Daniel Craig's good acting.

B0080SW3CC|5.0|This book was on my son's required Summer reading list.  I got a it's OK.  I think it was because he HAD to read it.  I heard nothing but great from the 20 or so Manga books he has read so far...

B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Why would a muslim write about Jesus Christ?  Nothing but more pure hatred and spreading of lies.  They don't want their Totalitarian Political System written about or talked about in any way, but they somehow feel they have the right to disrespect what anyone else believes?  Seriously?  This muslim is nothing more than a bigot parading his views as a hypocrite.  The lack of mentioning his own background is shameful and purely deceptive.  It's always nice to know what lies your enemy is spouting... makes it easier to point out the duplicity.<br /><br />I would suggest that if you want to read a book about Jesus Christ of Nazareth that you should pick up the Bible.  Jesus' entire life, from beginning to end, is captured there in it's entirety.<br /><br />Keep in mind, mohammed was a murder, pedophile, child rapist.  He didn't get his way so he set out to kill anyone who disagreed with him.  Why would ANYONE in their right mind want to associate with a psychopath that is well known to history to be mentally disturbed?

0553106635|5.0|George R.R. Martin faces a bold new challenge thus far in the series: that of keeping his sprawling story from crushing under its own mass.  It takes Martin the first hundred pages of A Storm of Swords just to bring us up to speed on his characters, the lives of all of who have been shattered by the ravages of war.<br /><br />The reader is given no fewer than ten story threads to follow, which can be cumbersome when switching between characters.  Depending on who your favorite characters are, readers can become nitpicky about certain chapters.  I’m sure that Martin must have become tired over trying to balance all of the characters at a certain point, specifically keeping in mind that some readers prefer certain characters to others.  However, with that being said, you should give the author the benefit of the doubt, and just trust his judgment in regards to who should get the most chapters.  It all works out in the end.<br /><br />Whereas some other fantasy novels are long, but shallow, Martin goes through painstakingly detailed story arches, characters and world building, to develop his novel into one of the best books in recent memory.  The reason that Martin is the biggest name in fantasy right now, is that his characters, and plots are multifaceted.  His characters are all powerfully conflicted individuals who actions, although troubling at times, are motivated by things we can all relate to: love, honor, justice, etc.<br /><br />What separates Martin from everyone else in the genre, including Tolkein, is that he likes to focus his characters right in the heart of darkness.  If the ending of A Game of Thrones surprised you and got your blood pumping – throwing all of the “good will triumph evil” themes that fantasy fans have gotten used to – A Storm of Swords has scenes that will likely leave some readers in a catatonic shock.<br /><br />In this saga, nothing is what it seems, including some of the most hated “enemies” of the novel.  Indeed, you might well wonder how the series will continue to out due its predecessors, and who will be left alive when the dust settles.  It is in this manner that Martin strips the fantasy genre of its usual naïve romanticisms of good overcoming evil.  Nothing is fair in life, especially when life consists of living in the perilous realm of Westeros.  Loyalties mean nothing, and true love only consists within songs and dreams.<br /><br />You might sit back and think that Martin is a pretty damn cynical man, and perhaps you are right.  Sometimes reading this book felt like it was just too much to take in.  The series without a doubt becomes taxing, specifically with the addition of this book.<br /><br />If you are interested in any of the usual fantasy tropes, this series is definitely not for you, especially this book.<br /><br />Five Starsight well wonder how the series will continue to out due its predecessors, and who will be left alive when the dust settles.
