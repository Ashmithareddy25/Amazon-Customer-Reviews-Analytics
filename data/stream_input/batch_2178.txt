B009FZHYKU|3.0|Andrea a leader?  Kinda has a John Wayne swagger so why not?  That may be the first chink in the armor of this super show. This and the whole show needs a little more plot development, or they could switch to an animated format. Developments aren't convincing me that the zombies, or what they represent, are a real threat, more of an irritating situation, like bad weather. Once all zombies are laid to rest, the real threat to civilzation must be what it always has been, the lack of skills needed to build it. None of this is depicted, for example, what about basic agrarian interests? Industrial needs? In this season the show is focusing on the survival interests of two deranged men. All the while the storehouse of manufactured supplies is dwindling. If this show is about the thinking vs unthinking, it could go much further.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|i saw this on the computer version and i had to get it. excellent app well worth $3 so go and get it
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Loved this story. Landay keeps you guessing up to the last page with 2 twists that no one will guess.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the entire series, sad with the new ending of season 3 but looking forward to seeing how they continue it.
B003R4ZMNQ|4.0|My husband really enjoys this as it is convenient to take with him when he travels and may have just a short rest period where he wants to watch something.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|Copy of Glee or vice versa. Seemed like minutes and minutes of blah with moments of acual comedy that might make you laugh.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Great movie, really good acting, Sandra Bullock is one of the best. Love the story, not just anybody would take a person in their home and care for them, like they did here.

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|A great game with cool graphics and story line. The puzzles are tricky and fun. I've really enjoyed the hunt and seek games they are very detailed. It's worth the three bucks to play for sure. Looking forward to the next one.

B00APUQRPC|4.0|There were parts that were predictable, but the overall message of family, trust, forgiveness, and love really resonates with this movie and the ending makes it a great choice for a date night or by yourself.
B00005LIN0|1.0|It is obvious this has been poorly stored.  It arrived with pieces of the case broken off and rattling around inside rhe case - with the label placed over the broken parts, as if to hide it.  In addition, it wouldn't even play!  Amazon refunded quickly, though.  Thank you, Amazon.

B0053O89IS|5.0|So this is the shortest bones season that's y the price is lower than other seasons<br />  There is 13 episodes on this season :( I should have waited to see if they did a different release of this season or something. Other than that great packaging once again, the season came well wrapped and protected, no scratched sic and with all the opening prevention stickers and all.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Didn't know what to expect as I didn't use IMDB before watching with kids and was a little concerned it may be too much for the little one in my house, but ended up loving this movie and we watched it again the next day it was so much fun.

B008QPCCQQ|4.0|Some obvious words misspelled.  Not sure if it's the authors fault but thinking probably not.  Otherwise this is a good collection of Alcott's works.  I had not heard of some of these works that are included on here.  Lots to read and choose from plus two other books!
0446581356|3.0|Soo let me start by saying this is an amazing quality book. The pages are thick and semi glossy the pictures are astounding and the quality of it all is great. The writing is clear and to the point. The sections are well labeled and helpful. My issue was it feel like there is more of a pre professional vibe to it. There a lot about cleaning and what to carry or bring and how to start in the business. There's awesome sections on moisturizing and a taking care of ur skin but I personally was hoping for more of a &#34;look book&#34; so to speak with color combinations and tips and different styles and ideas wench there's was some of but not a majority for sure. Also she does &#34; for Asian eyes/ faces...&#34; which is awesome I feel like to talk about diff tones and such

B000Q76K24|4.0|Mature, intelligent and thoughtful. I wish there were more like it. I can't add anything more than previous reviewers have already said, except to criticize those who questioned Damon's character's ability to ignore his wife, played by the beautiful Angelina Jolie. Of course he could. She trapped him into a loveless marriage and took him away from someone he truly loved, a girl who was authentic and with whom he had established a deep bond. The emptiness of the marriage, his dedication to duty, both towards his family and his country,  pushed him further inward and made him a grim amoral bureaucrat in his mature years. There is a scene where he is united with his old love ( who I actually find much prettier and fresher than Jolie)  where she describes what could have been --'We would have married and you would have been a professor in a college town, publishing your poetry.' I found it poignant, tragic and very moving--a completely unlived life.

B000QCS8TW|2.0|I would have given this book 4-5 stars if Martin would have been able to condense his stories. His books are way too long in length. I enjoyed this book so I purchased his next 2 books in this series. Martin needs to take a lesson from Tolkien and learn how to write a book that is manageable to read. I quit reading the second book about 800 pages in when I realized there was still over 500 pages to read.

B000LTAY1U|5.0|Simply put this is a solid watch and I'd recommend it to anybody looking to get into automatics, or add to their collection. It's elegant, sturdy, and conveys sophistication.<br /><br />I'm a student and work part time at Starbucks. All of my personal effects take serious abuse while I'm at work (via cleaning agents, heavy lifting, hot liquid spills, bumping into things, etc.). This watch has yet to show any wear. In fact I spilled bleach on the band and watch just today while I was doing laundry. After drying it off and washing the band in water, it still looks like I just got it out of the box.<br /><br />Most negative reviews fall into one of three categories: user error, unrealistic expectations, or user negligence. I've found many reviewers comparing this watch to more expensive automatics, which is unfair given its price. To this point I still believe this watch to be a bargain for what you get. There are also some reviewers who seem to have taken this watch into water and been shocked to learn it's not a diving watch. It's not and the instructions that come along with it clearly state you shouldn't take it into water like you would a dedicated dive watch. With that said, I haven't had any problems with the watch when I wash my hands, or when it incidentally gets splashed with water (or bleach for that matter).<br /><br />On another point some reviewers have talked about, I don't find the watch to be small. I have a medium to large size wrist and the watch does not at all look small, or feminine. I don't think Seiko had overweight girthy American wrists in mind when they designed it. However it does not have the oversized look that many fashion watch makers are opting for these days.<br /><br />If I could note something about the watch that could be improved, it would be the band. It fits the overall look of the watch, but I'm afraid it won't prove to be as durable as the watch itself.be the band. It fits the overall look of the watch, but I'm afraid it won't prove to be as durable as the watch itself.
B001HN694K|5.0|Saw this in 3D at the theater.  Watched it on Netflix until they no longer had it.  Withdrawal for a year?  Well, maybe six months.  But I had to have it.  Tim Burton at his best.

B00BGZ8OLA|3.0|I wish there was more after the boat story but still a good story. I think this movie would be good for animal lovers but there are some animal death scenes that are sad. They did a good job otherwise. Now, I want to read the book.
B001GXNBJW|5.0|If you love The Black Keys for their upbeat grooves, for rockin' guitar play, for their grassroots feel then you are going to love this album. It's dirty and raw, it's self-confident and bluesy, it's a feel-good romp that will get you clapping your hands on \\"Just Couldn't Tie Me Down\\" and pausing with the pauses on 10 A.M. Automatic- only to drop again once the beat drops. More professionally arranged than Thickfreakness, more coherent and with a bit more focus on clear vocals for Auerbach, but much less moody than Magic Potion. Pop this one in (or kick to it on your mobile device) to pass the time on commute, to rock out at home, or to drown out the repetitive, uninspired nonsense pop and rap that others try to pour from their rides. This is real rock and roll.

1572814349|5.0|Love the gilded edges and sturdy case design. I had planned on using them for bookmarks but am now hesitant- they're just too precious for that kind of treatment. I love tarot and am glad to say that even though art from a lot of christian-themed works are included (big surprise considering the majority of surviving European art was commissioned by the church) it isn't off-putting in its imagery for those who are not a part of the faith. The symbolism is universal and vague enough. If you're worried about quality of pictures don't be- they're spectacular and the piecing together is almost flawless. One thing I would note for the creator is that in the Swords suit it is often obvious that the hands of the figures were not originally intended to hold the large sword that is re-used in each image, although you could as easily attribute that to the failings of medieval artists who had a tendency to depict figures in unrealistic and awkward poses. A gorgeous artistic set.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|To the avid reader, once in awhile you stumble upon an exceptional read and treasure the experience. Goodwin covers the whole journey of Lincoln from cradle to grave and lays a foundation for an understanding of &#34;Honest Abe&#34; in a way I've never experienced before. It's hard to write a historical novel that reads like a story but Goodwin achieves this feat with this book. Warning: If you read this book before you see the movie, you might be a little disappointed in the limitations of the movie. This book is that good.
B009AMANBA|3.0|Caution: May Contain Spoilers. I saw \\"Lincoln\\" yesterday with my two closest friends, and... Before I get into that, I just have to mention that the show time I had planned to see the film at was sold out (I'd expected that for the final installment of \\"Twilight,\\" but not for \\"Lincoln\\"), and the theater house where the 4:50 show of \\"Lincoln\\" was playing was almost entirely packed, I kid you not. I was surprised, as I thought most people wouldn't be interested in a historical drama, but at the same time, I was pleased at the turnout for the movie.<br /><br />Now to what I think of the movie. \\"Lincoln\\" is a well-acted, well-directed and more or less well-written depiction of the days in January and several days of April 1865 where President Lincoln struggles with his divided Cabinet to get the Thirteenth Amendment ratified. The opening scene is all the glimpse we get of the Civil War. The remainder of the movie is straight-up talk. Don't let that stop you from experiencing this monumental motion picture, though. Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones play Abraham Lincoln, Mary Todd Lincoln and Thaddeus Stevens very well. I think we can expect Academy Award nominations for all three of them come Oscar® time. Other actors who give good performances in the limited screen time they have are Gloria Reuben (ER) as Elizabeth Keckley, confidant and dress-maker to Mary Todd Lincoln, Jared Harris (\\"Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows\\") as General Ulysses S. Grant, Joseph Gordon-Levitt (\\"Angels In The Outfield,\\" \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\") as Robert Todd Lincoln, S. Epatha Merkenson as Thaddeus Stevens\\" housekeeper, James Spader as W. N. Bilbo, David Straithairn as Secretary Of State William Seward and Hal Holbrook as Senator Preston Blair.<br /><br />The music by John Williams is excellent and perfectly captures the mood of the era. There are some light-hearted moments to balance the heavy drama, which includes grieving over the loss of a beloved son a few years earlier. Younger children who see this film may find those moments difficult to understand. Content-wise, though, the film has some problems. The intense scene of war violence and a brief scene of severed limbs being thrown into a pit, along with several uses of the N-word are historically accurate to the time period, and were, I felt, not thrown in to shock viewers.<br /><br />The combining of God's Name with a mild curse word is unfortunate, however. That may be how people spoke back then, though infrequently, but it can always be implied (a sound like a whistle or a mill or somebody falling muffling the blasphemy) if necessary. The throwing in of an f-word or two is also unfortunate, but the one time it's clearly audible it is done in a humorous context, and I felt was not thrown in for shock value.<br /><br />With the above-content enumerated, I recommend this film, which may be of particular interest for history buffs. For those interested in a film that depicts the Civil War, but without the gory violence and pervasive language so prevalent in war movies these days, I recommend \\"Gods And Generals\\" and \\"Gettysburg.\\" Both films have excellent acting, gripping storylines, well-written characters, beautiful musical scores, a strong commitment to historical accuracy (both movies were produced by Ted Turner, a Civil War buff) and most importantly, respect for God by both sides, North and South. \\"Gods And Generals,\\" the prequel is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of war violence. \\"Gettysburg,\\" made almost a decade earlier, is rated PG for intense war sequences and some language.<br /><br />2nd Note: I have since found out that President Lincoln strongly disapproved of profanity, and I regret going to view this movie in the theaters. Plus, the screenwriter likes men.<br /><br />EDIT - 3/4/13<br /><br />I stand by everything I said above. I just want to add something. The f-word was rarely, if ever, used in the 19th century. In fact, it was so infrequently said that the worddid not appear in American dictionaries until 1965, 100 years after the end of the Civil War. Plus, Lincoln rarely, if ever, used profanity, and I very much doubt that he swore, as depicted in the film (ie. combining God's Name with a mild profanity, thereby turning it into a strong religious profanity). The fact that the screenwriter, who is a man, is living with a man is also a huge issue for me, which I am not here to debate or discuss. However, I bring it up because that's been pointed out in almost every news article and one Q&A video about the film. It also means that those who pay money to view this movie, as I stupidly did, are thereby contributing to their perversions.did not appear in American dictionaries until 1965, 100 years after the end of the Civil War.

0345803485|1.0|Every bad review that you will read about this book is 100% accurate.  Kudos to the readers that could actually read this book all the way through..I could only make it about 100 pages before I felt the need to dip myself in sanitizer.  Just yuck.  The writing is awful - words are repeated multiple times within the same paragraph (and throughout the entire book), the author doesn't know how to desribe anything without telling you what color it is, and the plot is just horrible.  I can't understand how women fantasize about Mr. Grey (just guess what color his eyes are), as he is a controlling a**hole.  But wait, that's right.  Anastasia can change this man and make him fall in love with her if only she keeps doing what he demands.  The intimate scenes that I did read were just gross to me, not sexy at all.  I guess if reading erotica is your thing, you might be more into this book than I was.  I usually skip over sex scenes in books because they always seem so cheesy to me.  *shrug*  Do your brain cells a favor and skip this book.

But if that doesnt bother you its a great roller coaster of a read that had me sorry it finished. I almost felt the author rushed the final few chapters to finish it off... but it didnt detract from the overall experience.

0547884591|4.0|loved this book for its awesome section on survival very cool!! my hubby loved it as well!! great read and helpful tools
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Well written and enjoyable, and as with most of Clancy's works was difficult to put it down, but anxious to quickly get back to it.
B0059R5Q08|2.0|Of the four adaptions of the novel by Charlotte Bronte that I have seen this one is my least favorite.  The biggest flaw, for myself, was the casting of the two main characters, in particular Mia Wasikowski as the Jane Eyre.  To begin with, in the novel, Jane Eyre was small in stature.  This is a vital apect to the story as her physical demeanor is in direct opposition to her great principles and strong character.  In this adaption her stature was of medium size and the fact that Dame Judith Densch was so much smaller than she made it even more obvious.  The fact that Michael Fassbinder is a handsome man was less distracting because, in general, most of the actors playing Mr. Rochester were in fact very handsome and he did an adequate job in his portrayal but Ms. Wasikowski kept the same expression on her face the entire film.<br /><br />Another problem with this adaption was that, as in other adaptions, two hours in not enough time to do full justice to the film.  One of the best and most interesting parts of the novel are the conversations between Jane and Mr. Rochester.  While Jane is not equal to Mr. Rochester in money they are equal in intelligence and in strength of their convictions.  That is what is so appealing to him about Jane.  Although obviously coming from a difficult childhood Jane Eyre refuses to believe she is any less an individual and never feels sorry for past shortcomings.  The conversations are imperative as Mr. Rochester tries time after time to break down Jane's hard exterior to no avail.  In this film there is only one strong dialogue between the two making their ultimate love story less plausible.<br /><br />I will say give kudos to the cinematography, set direction and costuming as they were all very well done.  The gothic almost ghostlike quality of story was almost achieved.  I did not, as in other adaptions, ever feel put into the hypnotic trance that actually brought me, as the film viewer, to feel swept away to the moors and castles of England in the mid-1800s.<br /><br />My favorite adaption is the 1983 ten part BBC miniseries starring Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton.  If you have not seen it I would most highly recommend it as the adaption that most mirrors the novel.  I have yet to see any actress play Jane as well as Zelah Clarke.  She is petite yet composed and at times fierce in her convictions.  The fact that the mini-series is great in length does the novel its most justice.  Timothy Dalton was quite young at the time but I believe it is his best work to date.  Although exceedingly handsome his composure is perfect for the role.  Their conversations are the most intense and genuine.  Without continuing to make this review more of promotion for the mini-series I will end by saying that if you want to see the best the adaption of the novel the 2011 one is not it.f England in the mid-1800s.<br /><br />My favorite adaption is the 1983 ten part BBC miniseries starring Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton.

B009CF3MEK|5.0|I finally saw this 1974 movie by seeing it on my Kindle Fire.  Enjoyed the movie a great deal.  Glad I finally saw this classic.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Does the job. I would reccommend to anyone with an IPHONE. Directions a bit confusing but overall great product.  Price is great.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|After watching season 1 and 2 had to get season 3, great tv show, after very first episode, easy to follow and  understand what is going on. Very enjoyable. I am watching it with my 18 year old daughter and she is getting just as much joy out of it.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is so much fun you won't want to take a break.I usually play these games in casual mode,but decided to try advanced, which the only real big difference is you dont get the little sparkles for areas of interest.I think its much more rewarding to try to figure it out on your own.Be sure and use your map a lot. It shows you what areas you need to go next for an activity.The graphics are fantastic.This is one the the best hog games out there.You dont want to pass this one up.Get it now for some great fun.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I had a hard time putting it down!  Very engaging. Filled with lots of good action.  I recommend it without hesitation.
0345803493|5.0|Well written and kept reading til I was done. Don't know what else to say, it was just good reading.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|After watching first season had to start watching season 2 right away, addicting story lines, well done. Love all the history...
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Such a great read. It will definitely leave you with the feeling of being infinite. A highly recommended book for sure!
1416511946|5.0|It's a book so no need to worry about the packaging. But classic tale of a rock star who has too much too soon and doesn't know what to do with himself
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is really cute and fun to see your kids laugh and talk to Twilight. Also, the fact about rebuilding ponyville the kids own way makes their imagination run wild.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A fresh if troubled version of a who done it and WHY????? Complex, unlikeable characters but a plot that won't quit! A page turner<br />'til the very end!
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|There was way too may things they tried to cram into a single season that won't continue. That being said I'm excited to see what the next installment will bring
B007HACDLK|4.0|I liked the book. I had just finished \\"Kill Shot\\" and this was a good followup book. I did feel it was a little slow in the middle. Lots of action at the start, then it seemed to bog down a little. It ended well, but not as much action in between. I will read more of his books, since I enjoy this type of story.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Great book. I loved it when I first read it and as the saying goes it only gets better with time.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Great book with an unexpected ending! I love Spark's books even though they can be a bit predictable they make for a great short read.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|This book was just not as good as I thought it would be.  I didn't love the characters especially the main male love interest.  I really did not like the twist at the end.  I saw it coming about half way through the book but was hoping the author would not go there.  He did.  Ultimately, just a disappointing book.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game met my expectations and was the most similar game to Super Mario that I could find. I was very satisfied with the results of this game.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book was not as exciting to me as the first two, katniss was not as strong as expected.<br />Fair.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am addicted to this show.  Love it. Now I see why everyone is raving about this show.  Don't miss it.
B0058O84G0|5.0|This book was well written and researched.  The book uses non-fiction with fictional characthers and is cleverly integrated.  I really enjoyed reading this book and could not wait to read the second trilogy &#34;Winter of the World&#34;.
B00111YM5G|3.0|Well, the angels all became very human. The movie throws you an unexpected twist towards the end, and then falls flat at the very end with a stupid supposedly dramatic ending twist.<br />If you love Andy Whitfield, it's a nice watch; however, he's wearing clothes for most of the movie. If you don't care, then save your two hours of life for something else.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Was easy to understand, and easy to play!<br />This will be a nice addition to the games that I can take on the go, whether I am on a trip or just going some where for the day.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Son told us this was on sale at Amazon. Brought it and glad we did. Watched with grandkids. We enjoyed the movie.
B000FCKC4C|3.0|I don't know why this book received a &#34;RAVE&#34; category.  I found the book in some parts truly far fetched which spoiled the story.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Chose this series because a friend recommended it.<br /><br />Although I know they are just telling the a story. I sort of disliked how towards the end of each episode they don't give a glimpse of what is to happen on the next episode, like a small trailer. Because some times the next episode would be something that occurred way back in the characters past. So at times I would get lost as to what is happening until I find out, &#34;okay they are explaining something from there past&#34; But other then this everything was fine. Really liked the series.<br /><br />I would recommend this to viewers who like to watch movies or series about detectives or investigators. But are also into sci-fi. Sort of like X-Files and CSI type of mix here. Those who like Both X Files and CSI I think might like this. If not, sorry if I'm wrong.<br /><br />Thanks<br />-O
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is easily my favorite game to play on my kindle fire hd. There is a lot of progression to look forward to, there is also several difficulties and all sorts of different maps. I never get bored with the game but it is still easy to walk away from, it has both a pause and save feature. It is an easy enough game to get into whether your at home or in a waiting room or something, but it is also really challenging too! My favorite thing about it has to be the sheer cuteness of it all, there are so many different monkeys to choose from. The game overall is really very nicely put together and the graphics and music are great. I have no real complaints although it would be nice if it asked me to confirm when I wanted to sell one of my monkey towers... you have no idea how many times I accidentally hit the sell button! I definitely recommend this game.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|cool thing to use with an android phone or pc we like it and feel secure using it on our home network
B0071BGOJC|5.0|This book truly complements the first trilogy &#34;Fall of Giants&#34;.  The book was well written and enjoyable to read.  Cannot wait for the third trilogy!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love this movie of Downton Abbey. the scenes of the old house and the costumes are wonderful. I love the story so much I cannot wait till the next one.<br />It is refreshing in our time of awful movies on TV and Netflix.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|Ghost Protocol was very actioned packed as per usual with Tom Cruise,Paula Patton was very refreshing and a great addition to cast as was Jeremy Renneir & Simon Pegg,loved the movie a lot!
B0073PPNE8|4.0|This is one of my favorite movies. The actors are great even though I'm not particularly a huge Renee Zellweger fan she did do a good job in this. The score is also very good in this movie as well. Its not a feel good movie is sad and poignant.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|At this point in time, there's not much to say about this film that hasn't been said yet. It's brilliantly acted, directed, written, shot, etc. Much like Zero Dark Thirty, the audience knows how the film will end, but Affleck manages to keep us on the edge of our seat until the very last shot. Affleck has really become something of a Hollywood icon. After years of being known as that one &#34;pretty boy&#34; in horrible romantic comedies or stupid blockbusters, he now has three phenomenal films under his belt. Gone Baby Gone, The Town, and now Argo. I was a little worried when I first heard of this film because I was worried he peaked with The Town, but boy I was wrong. Although it wasn't my favorite film of 2012, I'm more than happy that it took home Best Picture at the Oscars. After a couple years, in my opinion, of &#34;Oscar bait&#34; films winning the top prize, here comes a smaller film that manages to provide hope for this country we live in. Recommended for anyone looking for a good story peppered with drama, humor, and tense moments. Sorry, I'm rambling and barely anyone will read this, but to those who do...BRAVO.
B000I9VZJ8|5.0|Napoleon Dynamite is one of those movies that you either love it or can't stand it.  It is so corny that I love it.  My Granddaughter who is 2 LOVES it!!  Napoleon has babysat her for many hours.
B0031RS2HC|3.0|The story, style and even technology are bit old fashioned. Checked the publish date, back in 1997. No wonder. A good book for entertaining.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Falling Skies Season 1 hooks you from the very beginning! It appeals to the sci-fi fan, the American history buff, and the romantic! Not just another doomsday series, it's one with a lot of heart!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is the best. You draw something and your opponent tries to guess it. When they do then they draw and you guess it.
031237674X|3.0|I actually personally prefer the books by Brian Weiss - and there is another book called &#34;Soul Survivor&#34; that everyone should read.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its an awesome game I would download it if I were you.its basically Mario though.but I would get it and the 2nd one
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I ordered the book because it was up for some Oscars and the movie looked good.  I loved this book.  I really got involved with the characters and I also saw the movie.  I like the book better - it was a great movie, but when I read Tiffany's letter to Pat it was so raw and honest, it was neat.  And I loved the ending as well.  Recommend it highly.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers and its very fun to play when I'm board. I hope that that there can be a subway surfers 2.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Spurred by. Chris' s gruesome. murder, I am not disappointed with my purchase. In his matter of fact writing Chris recounts a challenging life well lived.
0767847431|5.0|It has great sound nice viewing for all ages nice animation juust which I had more to watch loved this move
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Do not like the recent update at all.  Deleted it and went back to the app version prior to the update.
B00A861QMM|2.0|This was very disappointing. It has too much conversation and no adventures . Also the graphics was not up to g5 quality.<br />Quite disappointing and. A big waste  of time<br /><br />Pattic2u@yahoo.com
1401207529|5.0|This is Genesis. Its the prologue to one of the greatest characters ever conceived. It's a must have for any library, and needs to be shared with all. Frank Miller crafts a great tale and handles the character in a very unique way. If you don't pick this up based solely on the writing, then you will love the beautiful artwork.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|It was a great read even for this very old child. Lots of adventure without guns or gratuitous sex. A book I could give my grand kids.
B00969PR18|1.0|Couldn't even pinpoint my house... Not even my street!<br />Showed up as our neighborhood clubhouse!  How reliable<br />can it be?
B000VOC90Y|5.0|One of the best purchases I have made to date.  I priced the backpack at local stores and wasn't willing to pay the $110 price, receive the item promptly and it is well made and will last me for years to come.
B007R0WHMK|1.0|The acting was good but the story was too weird and not terribly interesting. I didn't find it plausible that a scent would cause people to bow down to its creator.
B0094K1MH2|5.0|Can't wait for Sequel! ......with a dynamic cast of voice actors, superb graphics and a story line full of surprises and intrigue, this movie keeps you glued to your seat. Just a really fun movie to watch and you never end up bored! Ten Thumbs Up! :D
B000007MVM|5.0|The sublime, divine and ironically rough-as-guts audio shining, of rocks craziest diamond. Syds genius may have apparently declined, but 'twas certainly evidenced right to the bitter-sweet end. This album is a testament to that.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This is a decent little bag for the price paid.  Wish it was bigger though.  Good quality product, came quickly, and the price was ok too!
B000UB915Y|5.0|Everyone should read this.<br />Children might like the story, but for them they don't need the lessons that are taught here as much as adults do.<br />The most important lessons of life and love are in here.<br />They are simple and yet in it's simplicity so profound.<br /><br />I think Antoine de Saint Exupery had it right.<br />I believe we're at our best as children. It's as we get older that we forget all the wisdom.<br />In life we should strive to stay young instead of grow up.<br /><br />I bought an old used copy, the Katherine Woods translated version, to give as a gift to my little brother when he turned 18 and wrote a note in it. I hope he keeps it for his lifetime and passes it on to his children. It is that type of book.
B009MJU69U|3.0|Beautifully made, but not in tune with the rest of Schleich horses in terms od proportion. Good quality, though. No regrets
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Not old plot best of all not much filler like most writers put in the middle'<br />He kept the plot moving forward better than some of his books,
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was told about this show by my daughter and ended up streaming all 3 seasons and watched straight through. My favorite characters are Mary, Lord James and the Dowager (Maggie Smith). All the actors are great. I think Matthew is kind of dorky but he has his moments, Another thing I really enjoy are the costumes. The storylines are great. I like the upstairs, downstairs view of life back then, I would highly recommend it and can't wait for season 4.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I downloaded the demo to see if my insomniac husband to find something to help him sleep.  Being able to build your own sounds and the levels of the various noises makes it the most unique setup I have encountered.  I have recommended the app to three friends to help with relaxation and as a sleep aid.  I know at least one of them actively use the app.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Ok the book was awesome.  Come on ladies who doesn't want a gorgeous rich man even with a kinky mind. The book was great it had romance, sex, you were happy, sad, mad it was like a rollercoaster of emotions. I wanted to be the one to comfort him, help him deal his problems. In the end they were right for each other.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am extremely pleased with the ease if using amazon instant! I will continue to use it for life. I love walking dead awesome show. I'm totally hooked. Hope it never ends!!!
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Really enjoyed the development of Reacher's relationship.  Seemed more focused.  At one point I thought she was the murderer.  Good mystery and an excellent read.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|There was something to like about this movie for the whole family ... our children ages 12 to 16 really enjoyed it.  My wife and I thought it was better than most of the teen movies we've seen recently. If you like shows similar to GLEE you'll really enjoy this movie.
B007V4530A|4.0|I served as a preacher for about nine years in a small, rural church in Southern Ohio. I know what it is like to craft sermons to persuade, convince, edify, correct, inform and reinforce, but being a big fan of TED, I wanted to read this for an upcoming sermon I have been asked to deliver about God's presence.<br /><br />What public speaker doesn't want to give a TED Talk? So, even if I could replicate Jeremy Donovan's research and dissect the top talks, I figured why not pay a few bucks and take advantage of his efforts.<br /><br />Because of my experience and education in public speaking, I felt like Donovan was just rehashing a lot of public speaking basics. If you read some of my other reviews, you will notice I often do not have a great first impression of books. And this was the case here.<br /><br />It wasn't as if what Donovan was writing or the ideas about speaking he felt were worth spreading were bad ones. The information was good, but I had heard a lot of it before.<br /><br />However, as I continued through the book, Donovan started giving an example of why this is good, consider doing this for your transition and other insights.<br /><br />What I found interesting, I just finished working on a book my wife wrote, [[ASIN:B00BFNRHFW Princess Grace: A Tale of Faith, Hope & Love]], in it, she found herself rewriting it to match up better with the Hero's Journey, well Donovan talks briefly about this story structure in the book.<br /><br />In the end, I was glad I read the book. It is well-rounded, and it covers all aspects of giving a presentation. The work continues to build throughout, and it is definitely worth the price of admission. Donovan's book has helped me craft the sermon I am delivering, and it will truly be a TED TALK -- To Encounter the Divine: Think about what God's presence means for your life; Accept God's invitation; Live in God's Presence; Kindle the spark of the divine in others.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Awesome you wouldn't  want to know how many pages I<br />highlighted for my favorite pages! so much ! I love it
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I hated it it was the worst book I have ever read newsreels . . . .<br /> . . .
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Super insightful,intelligent,sweet,sweet book.Admittedly, I hesitated because I thought the book would be depressing but it is well worth the tears.
0880796863|5.0|Great set of cards for beginners or long time readers! Artwork is gorgeous and comes with a small pocket guide to help during a reading.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Beautiful story, have read it many times and will continue to do so, love Jane Austin the title tells the story.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This was a good book that really lets you know her true thoughts before during and after the kidnapping. I recommend this book.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My son showed me this game, and it is very difficult to put down...so it is his fault I don't get enough sleep now!
B001FB55Y4|4.0|I like Guy Ritchie movies (except Revolver) and this one delivers.  Like &#34;Lock, Stock & 2 smoking barrels&#34; & &#34;Snatch&#34; a good cast with a move around story line.  Choice.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this game every day.  It's fun and it's better than watching some of the programs that are tv.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a very fun and exciting game. and you  can always improve your score. and its great to compete against each other.
0812416503|5.0|The writing , especially the descriptions was exquisite.  The characters all seemed very real and the story developed very well.
B009POCG2C|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  A bit predictable, but good nonetheless.  Clint is great; John Goodman does a good job, Amy Adams is really good (first if seen her & love her red hair), Timberlake was also very good.  With baseball as the background, it hit a Grand Slam for me.  BTW - Bryce Harper should see this one.  hahahahahha
B00571F26Y|5.0|Excellent resource.  Explains the reasons for a lot of health issues in this country and the lack of response to current dietary recommendations which have been an abject disaster.  Highly recommended.
0345525558|3.0|the writing was good, It was very predictable, and I really got tired of the flower commu;nications.  Also it would be nice to have a story about a somewhat normal person.  I lost patience with her.
B00AESN8XY|3.0|it will be fun at first then you relize ghat it is really stupied and a waste of time........ don't wast your hard earned money on it
B004YSDT4I|4.0|Missed it when it was in theaters.  Great cast, complicated story.  Need nine more words to finish minimum word count.
1446303314|5.0|This  is a beautifully done book by tone Finnanger. I love her designs and wonderful sense of colors and patters she uses in her designs. I own some of her previous works and have enjoyed them all. She puts together easily understood instructions for her pattern designs and the beautiful photos of the completed works encourages me to make my own. I enjoyed this book very much.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|this game is a must for the star wars fan + angry bird lover.  princess leia buns?  cute on the bird.  i wanna hear them say luke i am your father lol.  same principle as the other angry bird games.  easy to play, fun to see bits of star was integrated in to the familiar angry bird settings
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Impressive first hand account of the motivation, selection, training, hardships, and the incredible skill and endurance of our most elite and most lethal fighting force.

B0010DGYJW|5.0|What can i say...Blackie Lawless has outdone himself on this project!<br /><br />One of the greatest concept albums of all time...just brilliant!<br /><br />Lawless is very underrated but clearly one of the best songwriters ever!
1608871452|5.0|I really wish they had waited to release this until the end of Season eight because of everything that's gone on with it, but this is a wonderful book for any fan of supernatural.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|its been a while since I've run into a singer with such power in her voice. her songs are well written, too.
B006QS0KO6|4.0|I thought this was going to be a children's book and though I'm sure children would enjoy it, it also had some some themes that adults can learn from too. It's a super easy read and definitely worth picking up if you don't know the story. Also, this book is beautiful and a great copy for the price.
B000SLP4SE|4.0|Old Markie Mark does a great job with acting in this movie and the story is pretty good too. Gotta watch it!
B009GEAPYW|5.0|I read the graphic novel when it first came out. So, seeing the novel made into an animated movie was priceless!  I highly recommend.  The animation was good but the storyline is fantastic!
B00AU15HPC|4.0|Love the new album, especially the bluegrass influence rework of \\"cold outside of your heart\\".  BUT...could somebody tell me whats going on with track 13 \\"rising\\"?  its nothing more than a song fragment... what a waste.  I downloaded the album and was in heaven until I heard this.  I wondered if it was meant to be an intro to track 14 the disco'd \\"out there somewhere\\".  There is a gap between the 2 songs... Track 13 ends abruptly and there is a silent gap before track 14... very disappointing.  Otherwise, great effort by Justin... worth a listen.
B008M721MS|2.0|I don't understand how it works.but I . can't wait until it is easy to work.I am so lost. it looks like a lot of fun.
B00821OX98|5.0|This show has solid action, a great story and characters that are believable. This is a must see for any Sci-Fi fan.
630469878X|5.0|A real oldie but goodie.  Great to revisit this movie now and then.  Bought 2 copies for a friend and myself after a trip thru the canyons of AZ and UT which is where some of this movie was filmed.  No, we did not go off a cliff in a convertible.
0679890475|5.0|This is an excellent choice for toddlers.  Not only is there repetition, but different animals and, of course, P.D.Eastman.  His books are always excellent.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I found this book (Kindle Edition) through an Amazon recommendation and thought the title and setting intriguing. Plus, I couldn't beat the sale price of $.99. I really wanted to love it, but I didn't. Although I enjoyed the story, I felt the pace a bit slow at times and the ending too abrupt. I wanted more of a payoff than I got. Parts of the story were a bit formulaic and predictable. I was interested in the characters and I liked the overall subject, but I think the story could have gone further. I don't feel as if I learned that much more than when I started. Not a bad book, but I've read better.
0689835604|5.0|I love this as it is a peek-a-boo type.  The section that lifts is durable and easy for babies to manage.  They learn terms such as under, over, inside etc.  A great starter book.
B00AYB0SX4|2.0|This was a true horror film. The most horrific scenes are when Jennifer Lawrence sings. Right about the third time that she sings I had to shut it off. Oh the horror!!! Glad I only wasted a $1.31 to rent it. Do yourself a favor, if you insist on seeing this film, have earplugs in hand. You've been warned!!!
B002NOAF9W|3.0|I have the Cd<br />I was hoping for a Concert DVD not just a few songs<br />The Cd is my second all time favorite<br />the DVD was weak
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I prefer playing on the kindle fire or the ipad, ipod touch is just too small with the larger boards.

B0055SWM08|5.0|good way to pass idle time and excercise your noodle lots of free levels i will likely buy more levels soothing graphic very zen
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Very interesting concept.  Plot was well thought out making you care for the characters.  My only complaint is that the ending was relatively predictable and similar concepts were used too many times in other time travel novels.  This is all that stands between this being a good novel ad a great one. I still reccomend this book.
B003Y2XI8W|5.0|This band re sparked my love for music. It made me want to explore and discover non radio Top 40.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is an awesome game. I think that ypi should be able to change the seanery a little more often though because the same seanery is getting old. But other then that it is a cool game.
B00AR83PN4|4.0|Terrific puzzle - it keeps you on your toes and<br />makes you think and its alot of fun also.  Thanks<br />Amazon for another good puzzle.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Movie was great from beginning to end. Loved the photography, it was beautiful. Daniel Craig did a good job as 007.
B0097HSS4M|3.0|Effects selection and overall customization choices are somewhat lacking.  I think that picsart is better.  However, I have not finished a picture in this yet so cant speak to the quality of the rendering.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Yes, it was a good movie, but immediately after reading the credits (where it admitted it had been dramatized), I had to get on the internet and read up on the IRANIAN HOSTAGE CRISIS to put it in historical focus re: Carter and Reagan. At least it made me &#34;do my homework.&#34;  So for that I gave it a &#34;liked it&#34; rating.  I was mostly interested in Affleck's character's background that reportedly made him the best &#34;exfil.&#34;  (ex-filtration versus infiltration specialist), and then about the rest of his character's life afterward.  I was reminded at the end just how different our country is from foreign countries, and so far how lucky and relatively safe we are to live here and not there.
B00A8307BG|4.0|This is a very good 2013 album of Robin Trower doing covers of blues standards.<br /><br />Robin Trower's guitar playing is excellent as always. He also does vocals on this album; he's not as strong a vocalist as the late James Dewar was on those early 1970s Robin Trower albums but Trower still handles the vocals well.<br /><br />While this is a very good album I don't rate it quite as highly as Trower's last two albums, What Lies Beneath and The Playful Heart. I've rated those two albums as 5 stars so, by comparison, I've given this one 4 stars.<br /><br />But don't let that deter you from buying this album. If you like Robin Trower, you'll like this one.<br /><br />Another great Robin Trower album.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Wish you had close caption. English accent is at times hard to understand. Will you be offering close caption soon?
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|Could have used less of the romantic, but the pure Trek content was excellent. The story flow from episode to episode kept me on the edge of my chair.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I got this and beat evrythig but the last levels to hoth why is there no update IM GETING TIRED OF WAITING ITS REALY ANNOYING JUST URG GIVE ME A UPDATE
B0044DEAUA|1.0|When I first received the Supertooth Buddy it seemed to work very will. Pairing was no problem, and the sound was great. Then I noticed that several times a day, when I got back in my vehicle that the Buddy would connect with my Android but I could not place any outgoing calls. The phone would indicate that I was connected to the Buddy, however when trying to make a call I would get only silence. The call would never go through. I could turn off the Buddy and place the call through the phone without bluetooth and the call would go through. Then if I turned the Buddy back on and let it connect with the phone again, I could once again place calls through the bluetooth Buddy. This would happen 3 to 4 times a day. After one week I got frustrated, threw the Buddy in a drawer and started using my trusty old Motorola t505 again. When it worked the Supertooth Buddy did have much better sound then the Motorola t505.
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I have seen the Swedish films and loved them, and I love this movie. It is one of those that no matter how many times I watch it I get completely into. The pacing and acting are amazing. So do yourself a favor and buy this film.
0312330537|5.0|This novel is amazing. It took me several months to read, but I enjoyed every moment. It is adventure, love story, philosophical, travelogue. I would highly recommend.
B0029QRA1U|2.0|This turntable works alright as a turntable, but the Vinyl to MP3 part is absolutely terrible.  It sounds like you're recording underwater when you plug the USB cable into your computer and try to use the &#34;EZ&#34; vinyl converter software they supplied with the turntable.  According to the other reviews, this piece of junk should crap out on me in a few months, so I'll probably be sending it back.  Be warned, the transfer quality to Mp3 is awful, and a lot of reviewers are saying this thing just falls apart after a while.
B00992CF6W|4.0|this is a great game! so creative! it is a must have! I recomend it to everyone. I am 13 and I love it! my sister is 11 and she loves it too! you must get this app.
B003TTMFCK|5.0|You like Drama?  Then you came to the right place.  I can highly recommend this show.  Try it out you won't be disappointed.
B003VS0CX8|1.0|Don't order this!  It doesn't work.  I ordered it for a birthday present.  It didn't work.  Lovely.  Not only did I give a gift that does not work, I get to return it.  Skip the grief.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Although my daughter and son-in-law talked a lot about it, their preferences in entertainment are far divergent from mine. After about three episodes, it was apparent that I would have to see all the seasons in order. Great acting, graphics, and stories. Well thought out with hidden hints and references that become prevalent as the season progresses. The episodes should be watched in order to get the most out of it.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Keeps me connected to my friends and authors.  I Love this app on my new kindle fire...  I highly recommend to those who have the kindle.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Slightly predictable, I feel I knew the ending half way through the book. But I still could not put it down and thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. A page turner and an easy read.
B005DNBDXM|4.0|Definitely worth the watch. We watched it right at the time of the real-life close asteroid fly-by and also the meteorite hit in Russia.
B007REV4T8|5.0|i like this movie for one I am a big fan of bond. there  was lots action.<br />I was very sad to see that the em was killed off.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love this game, find myself playing this after my son goes to bed, not just for children,better on tablet than computer
B00006FDCD|5.0|My family was looking to watch &#34;IT&#34; on netflix and no success in finding it. So I went on amazon and found it for sale and a good price. It arrived as quoted and my family was excited to watch it. Good quality product.
B005HSL626|1.0|I have tried multiple times to download this game, each time it downloads and then it gives me&#34;oops, fruit ninja has stopped working&#34;
B00BHMF578|4.0|The movie is worth 4 stars.  The Amazon picture quality of this &#34;HD&#34; stream is not.  The first 5 minutes I was missing frames, lots of skipping.  The compression is fairly extreme.  I have 50Mbps internet and watched on a PS3.<br /><br />Ben Affleck is a topic I could write a lot about.  His career has been very interesting - it is starting to add up to a top tier of the &#34;A&#34; list.  He has always been an A list star... but has effectively separated to an elite tier.  For several years I thought of Matt and Ben together of course because of Good Will Hunting as well as other films.  After seeing the subsequent post GWH Oscar path Matt took (Rounders, Talented Mr Ripley, Finding Forrester, Bourne, Syriana) vs Ben (Phantoms, Armageddon, Reindeer Games, Pearl Harbor, Surviving Christmas, Gigli), it fell into the ignorant position that Matt was the brains of the GWH outfit.  Now as I examine Ben's entire list of work, what he has been part of, directed, produced, etc, it is extraordinary and fully recognize that GWH was a totally shared collaboration.<br /><br />Agro itself, good.  Is it classic, I don't think so right now.  I felt sometimes the period music segues were a bit forced, the dramatic music theme a bit forced.  I enjoyed watching it and respect it.  It wasn't my personal choice for best picture but I have no quarrel with its selection.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|It is very funny to me :D It is so absurd mąny times I can only laught.<br />I like it very much :) It's real fun:) And has lots of Orgasms :D Who does'nt love those?
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The set was a gift for my son.  He really like watching these movies when they first came out.  A great price on the product.
B00AHGH6XQ|4.0|The only reason I gave this 4 stars was due to the significant shelf wear present on an item that was brand new. Makes me wonder if was re-sealed before delivery. (the product came from a 3rd party seller here on Amazon).<br /><br />I have seen most of the previous Batman movies and was not that impressed. Especially with the Batman character being played by different actors as it went along. Very disconcerting. This trilogy is the benchmark for classic comic heroes brought to the big screen. All the others should be judged by this trilogy, IMHO. (your opinion may vary, but that is your right).
B000PHNHMQ|5.0|I bought this from the local orange box store after trying a really cheap brad nailer from another store.  I should have tried this one first.  The build quality on this nailer is supreme and it nails anything I give it.  If I could afford Makita's bigger nailers I would buy those too.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|I found the book difficult to stay with, and ponderous to read....and I didn't get very far - maybe if I'd gone further I would have stuck with it, but I couldn't seem to care about the characters.
B00821OX98|3.0|I like this show as it gives us the thought that the world could be full of others that do not see us as wonderful. The disappointing part is the complete disregard the survivors have for doing things safely, by always being out in the open. But I do appreciate the way they study their enemies to defeat them . Overall a good show
B004LUS390|5.0|Amazing it almost seems like your drawing on actual paper! There is an unlimited amount of colors and different kinds of drawing utensils to choose from.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|As usual Nicholas Sparks writes a great story. I really enjoyed this one. Great ending, I will probably watch the movie too.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Makes we want to start my own biker club. Only if I knew how to ride a motorcycle I would get one.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Thank you for taking the time to package your process into an understandable process. John's method should work for promoting almost any product.
B004I9CXHW|5.0|I purchased this for my 2012 Audi Q5 so that I could listen to music downloaded on a USB drive.  It works great!
111846446X|5.0|Se los recomiendo si estan empezando con el raspberry pi, les dara una muy buena guia para usarlos correctamente y sin arruinarlo.
034580404X|5.0|YuMMY... YuMMY... YuMMY is what I can say & describe for this trilogy!!! Oh yes, Christian Grey where is he? LoVe this Trilogy, been a long time since I read something GreeaaaT!!! Thank You
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|This book is a great read that takes the readers through the journey of life. It's more than about love but also about finding one's self and learning to truly forgive others. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a good funny and uplifting story.
1574214276|5.0|This book is a collection of tangles. For a beginner (like me), it gives step by step instruction for 101 tangles. A great reference book.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Incredible! I just loved it. I have seen different versions of Les Mis in theater, novels, love  stories, but this is it. Recommended!!!
B00785P2QC|3.0|very addicting game that will me hold me over till the new Sim city and I do understand they are running a business but to complete goals this early (like build big ben) and be 75% away on invest points.. which are hard as hell to.come by free while completeing other tasks but instead making you pay for it is crazy. this isn't a full fleshes Pc game so it shouldn't cost me 100$ to get enough credits to get me thru two weeks then have to pay again.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I couldn't put the book down. The troubled teenager tells his story through anonymous letters to a \\"friend\\" who cannot write back. It's a story of finding yourself through experiences with friend's and  family, and learning to live life instead of watching it go by. The story touches up on some serious issues, I'd recommend this book to mature readers.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|really loved this season of Fringe, looking forward to the next season.  Very creative show and exciting to watch.  Also being able to watch it one episode after another made it possible to better understand the characters.
B0067Q04AM|5.0|The dearth of artistic talent is painfully evident upon the tuning of one's dial to top 40 stations NY to LA. Enter Glasper, and his refusal to stay in one lane as he masterfully weaves among the crowded field of the less talented to take Grammy gold and challenge convention as Miles, Byrd, and Hancock have done before him. Glasper's reimagining of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" is nothing short of brilliant. In a time where popular music has been reduced to digital effects and anthemic hooks, perhaps Black Radio will reawaken a love of INSTRUMENTS & real music.
B005H9B44A|3.0|Good movie.  Nothing I couldn't have missed.  I liked it but it was over done with special effects rather than acting.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|Had me captivated from the first episode all the way to the end. I definitely recommend. Spartacus is a hunk!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book kept my interest the whole time ...Was so true to fact of how many women are abused by men that they marry and feel so helpless and frightened when they feel there is no safe way out of it ....God Bless those who have found the strength to leave that type of relationship and make a new life....<br /><br />Nicholas Sparks please continue to write more these type of books ...It is an eye opener for many who have never been in an abusive relationship....I also saw the movie and was so happy that they stayed close to the book version...
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season definitely is the best so far. The twists and turns of the surviving groups is so random yet juiy. AMC definitely didn't disappoint
0312945973|3.0|This could have been an exciting, interesting novel, but it never fully engaged me. I like historical fiction and descriptive language, but the long winded descriptions throughout the novel did not hold my interest. The story line is creative and interesting, so I stuck with it for the 650 pages, but I won't pick it up again. The story is told by an Egyptian slave named Taita. And, good lord, is he awful! Using first person narrative, he, naturally, refers to himself throughout the entire story. Unfortunately, he is THE most intelligent person in the world and will remind you of it on every page. His genius encompasses medical practice, battle strategy, architecture, finance, mummification, sexual prowess and counseling royalty. The only better people on the planet happen to be his mistress, Lostris, the princess of Egypt, and her love, Tanus. All of the action, romance and adventure was lost on me, because of the unbelievable nature of these three characters. I'd look elsewhere for an Egyptian adventure.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Excellent show.  We cannot wait until the next season comes out.  It is so convenient to be able to watch this show online when according to my schedule.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|A Keeper. Denzel Washington is great but Kelly Reilly as Nicole is simply an unbelievably convincing actress!  A must see movie.
B008Y73940|5.0|&#34;The Lincoln Lawyer&#34; we loved it. Matthew McConaughey was awesome. I loved that he treated the people around him with respect while using humor. Awesome movie. I highly recommend to anyone.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Took a little while to get engaged, but had enough twists and creepy moments to make you want to see the next episode.  There were enough suprises to make it interesting.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Very challenging and addicitive little game. Enjoy it very much.  Will probably purchase whole set once I'm done practicing on these free ones.  Thank you.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The HD aspect makes this version of England's best soap opera wonderful to watch, even on a tiny Kindle Fire screen.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I hate/love that ending for season 3.  Pease don't stop filmng this story.  I can't wait for the next season.  Well done and well cast.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|This is a good escapist movie with lots of action.  Tom Cruise and company have lots of &#34;James Bond like&#34; gadgets.
B00AJLHULW|2.0|I would have to agree with the others that gave it a two star review. A disappointing uninspired new release from Robben. And it's a shame with the caliber of musicians that played on the album. Robben is an amazing guitar player and an award-winning musician and there is no doubt about his talent. This album just wasn't his best. And I have everything he ever released including collaborations and appearances. Even the KISS album Creatures Of The Night that he played in! This is disappointing for me as I feel that Robben is going in to the \\"mellower\\" side of things as he age and I don't think this is what the fans want to hear. There are no stand out songs on this album and I even fell asleep at one point. It got one play and just like another reviewer said, it went to the CD file collection. Hopefully this is not the last album we hear from Robben. He needs to crank up that Dumble Overdrive Special and burn some hot jazzy-blues licks he's known for! I'm your biggest fan Robben but sorry, you're better than this.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love the episode!  I obviously recommend it!  Although they take way too many breaks during the year and it would be nice to have more...
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book is a thinker. i read it i about 4 hours it was so hard to put down Great BOOK
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest = awesome and addicting! You can get many ideas and be humored. My friend got me hooked. I'm addicted and I can't wait to actually use some of this.
8866130923|1.0|I'm giving one star for this product page.  I see no indication of the size of this product.  What is &#34;large&#34;?<br /><br />I wish I could purchase this - but I can't without knowing how big it is.<br /><br />Am I missing it?
B007IK44CK|5.0|Great movie!  Tom cruise hasn't lost his knack. The acting and story line are both great.  You are pulled in quickly.  Good ending too - of course!
0345529057|2.0|It was a Christmas present for my daughter and she just got to book 3 a couple of days ago and found about 100 pages missing, Some pages were printed twice and after page 240 the pages that remain are not in any numerical order. It is a fact that  I will have to go out and buy book 3 again even though I've already purchased it once.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book was a page turner. I wasn't sure what was going to happen next. As the ending approached, it seemed what was inevitable, would happen, but instead I'm just left thinking, but not in a bad way. People stay together for crazy reasons.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Gillian Flynn's writing. Loved the pace, humor, and sarcasm.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|if i could give 10 stars i would  i could not set it down, it  interfered with  mydaily chores  love to have more of this quality  thank you kathleen
B006YM9JSW|5.0|Upgraded from an LGA1366 2.6 GHZ i7 and have been extremely happy.  Being the cheapest LGA2011 chip currently it definitely does not let you down.  I have mine overclocked to 4.0 GHZ with no problem using just the multiplier and a Noctua heatsink.
B006LSZECO|4.0|i was absolutely unable to see where this was going.  highly improbable but than that's what made it a great read
B00992CF6W|5.0|BEST FRICKING GAME I EVER DAMN PLAYED BUY OR U WILL BE IN SHAME!!! Im joking brov lollololv l l
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love the game. However, I would love to be able to complete all games in the  level, even if there are enough points to advance TO the next level. Still an excellent game. Highly recommended. :-)
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Wanted, wanted, wanted.......'out of stock'.....waited, waited, waited.....'available by xx-xx-xxxx' **frantic beating of the keyboard** 'your order has been processed'....proceed to party!!! Definitely worth the wait!! Met or exceeded absolutely every expectation....and I am INSANELY picky about my knives!!! Just buy it already!!!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I totally love this book. its a sexy,fun thriller that adults and children will love.ive never read a book so good in my entire life.cassandra clare is my all time favorite author!!!!!
B002HRQLXE|5.0|What else needs to be said, it's Mel Brooks....another perfect example of comedy before 'political correctness' destroyed the movie (and every other) industry. Buy it before some idiot 'PC Nazi' has it banned!!
B005PK56TA|5.0|Well written, engaging story, check it out, you will like it, acting is good, and there are some good twists.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Definitely worth every penny, shouldn't have waited so long! Stop looking at it and make the purchase! You will not be disappointed!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Excellent graphics and there are many levels of play possible.  The pieces are easy to recognize and the squares are clear.  In addition, there are no glitches in how the program runs.  Great for beginners and intermediate players who want to play a quick game.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Very adventurous and interesting, I en<br /><br />joyed it a lot considering that it was different from all the other same old same old books I like. I think this book is made for ages 16 and up I also recommend this book for people that like mystery/adventure books. You will find this book very different and probably the best book I have ever read. I can`t wait to read the rest of the series. I also recommend people to watch the pretty little liars tv show.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|Answered many questions about US Foreign policy from before WWI to present. Like how the thousand and more military bases the United States have manned round the world, are used to enforce our policies on the rest of the world.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|Wow what a ride!  Life as a rock star isn't all that great!!  The second book is just as good.
B0013FDM7E|1.0|The reason why I give this particular movie such a low rating is simple: it ends different from the version that I originally saw. I first rented the movie on Amazon which had a good story ending, so I purchased it. The dvd ends up with the main character dead, and a stupid death at that. I was thinking &#34;Wow, only people as dead headed as those in Hollywood would come up with such an ending!&#34; Why is the ending different when I rent it online?
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is very fun don't want to give any spoiler alerts. I luv this game i hope u have sooo much fun like i do cuz it is fun fun fun!!!!!
B00571F26Y|5.0|Although this may be difficult ,my husband and I are trying this change. The book is very convincing. Glad for the received.<br />The info is appreciated!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a totaly cool and adventurous game. I have a hard time turning it off at night.  I recommend this game to everyone.
0143038419|5.0|The movie does not do the book justice AT ALL!  This book didn't make me want to leave my husband, but I felt like I was right there with her in her travels.  Wonderful read.<br /><br />Love you Julia Roberts.... that movie was no more than a shadow of the book.
B00AFEY354|5.0|everyone should watch this movie. it is truely fantastic. when i was watching it i was laughing, and crying it was a perfect mix of both.also this movie is SO inspiring, it says to follow your dreams do what you love and be yourself. everyone needs to see perks of being a wallflower you won't regret it!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I work night shifts which means I watch a lot of TV shows and movies. This is by far one of my favorites. Great character development, plenty of thrills, drama, mystery, action and comedy. Its my go to no matter what mood I'm in. You won't be disappointed.
B00008ENTJ|1.0|I have an original 1979 pressing of this album that is showing its age and I thought I'd give a new one a shot. Boy, was I disappointed! This version sounds dead and lifeless because the bristling high end that made this such an exciting album in its day has been totally EQ'd out. The vocals are down right muddy on most tracks. Plus, whoever actually cut this to the master disc obviously doesn't know how to read a set of level meters because the channels on side two are way out of balance. The left channel is at lest 5 dB louder than the right! To make matters worse, all of the treble is gone from the right channel as, well. Why didn't somebody hear this? People are going back to vinyl looking for quality, not a shoddy job of mastering like this.... I'd send it back but I got so frustrated trying to listen to it that I ripped it off the turntable and threw it across the room.  At least one copy won't be able to torture anyone else's ears now. It's in the trash where it belongs!
B00B2166BS|5.0|Works well, allows me to free up the micro-USB port for plugging in my mouse, keyboard and flash drives. Good choice if you need that other port.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|A GREATEST Series from HBO.  Hope they continue with it and not end it to soon like they did with Carnival.
B008K8X0IS|5.0|This package is beautifully packed and the quirky little egg makes it adorably awesome. Definitely a must have for anyone who enjoys this series!
B007REV4YI|5.0|One of the best Bond movies since &#34;From Russia with Love&#34;  Thanks Daniel Craig for keeping it up to snuff.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|The second season of this series of epic proportions is just as amazing as the first. The packaging is decent for a non-collector's box and it includes a few HBO promotions, etc. Warning: you will hate Geoffry more than ever.
B00271HAK8|5.0|I watched this movie when it was new and I was pretty young.<br />My kids watched it recently and laught their tales off, Great movie .
B007L6VR12|5.0|Such a cute and quirky movie, something I will probably watch again. Everything came properly, and I will be watching again!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Great book with distinct echoes into our present time. The portrait of Chase throughout the book and Lincoln's relationship to him is fascinating.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|I love Jo Nesbo´s novels and this one was outstanding. The insights into the past and the current case combination was quite interesting.
0452298482|5.0|After reading this book for a Book Club discussion, I took it to work and one of my co-workers was ao enthusiastic about it that I bough another to give it to her as a present. I am planning to use the material for one of our talks in Marriage Encounter. Very wise advice, simple, touching, the summary of great experiences
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|This was the second scariest film I've ever seen (the first being the American version of \\"The Ring\\", the gold standard for horror films). Many horror films about the supernatural start out well, but devolve into absurd wrap-ups (e.g. \\"Insidious\\", \\"Mama\\"). By contrast, \\"Sinister\\" has a tight story and excellent editing. Really well-done. The dark, shut-in atmosphere -- and Ethan Hawke's rather unlikeable character -- didn't lessen the suspense, which gripped me throughout the film. An excellent, super-scary ending. Recommended for fans of scary, supernatural horror.

Before taking command on the Intrepid, he command the battle cruiser Griffin.<br /><br />Q'eeng is a Commander in the the Dub U Navy and the Executive Officer of the Intrepid.<br /><br />Kerensky is a Lieutenant in the the Dub U Navy and the Astrogator of the Intrepid.<br /><br />West is Chief Enginner of the Intrepid.<br /><br />Hartnell is Medical Chief of the Intrepid.<br /><br />In this story, Dahl meets Duvall in the in a Dub U space station while waiting on the shuttle from the Intrepid.  Then he introduces her to Hansen.  Later Finn and Hester appear in the company of three MPs.<br /><br />When they arrive on the Intrepid, Dhal is assigned to the xenobiology laboratory.  He soon learns that any away team lead by the principal officers has a high casualty rate.  When he lunches with the otther newbies, he learns that everybody on the Intrepid is afraid of away parties.<br /><br />Then everybody in the xenolab except Dhal vanishes just before the Captain and the Xo show up.  Q'eeng hands him a sample vial and tells him to put it in the Box for analysis.  Dhal is told to produce the results in less than six hours and the senior officers. leave.<br /><br />When the xenolab crew return, Dhal learns that the Box is a piece of advanced technology.  Basically it is magic for all the xenobiology crew know of it.  So Dhal stick the sample into the Box and pushes the start button.<br /><br />Slightly less than six hours later, a ding announces that the Box has completed the analysis and results show up on a lab tablet.  Dhal is told to take the tablet to the bridge and show it to Q'eeng.  He is also told to say that the results are not fully complete.<br /><br />Dhal runs out of the lab and almost knocks over Finn.  He is also on his way to the bridge to deliver a manifast.  As they hurry toward the bridge, Finn mentions that he likes the relaxed atmosphere on the ship.<br /><br />After Dhal delivers the Box results, he and Finn leave the bridge.  Then a hairy creature appears before them and tells Dhal to stay off the bridge from now on.  He also suggest that Finn do the same.  Then he vanishes.<br /><br />Finn asks whether the creature was a yeti because of its hairy body, but Dhal declares that it was Jenkins.  He tells Finn what he knows about Jenkins.  Dhal wonders where has been hiding.<br /><br />Later the newbies get to participate in an away team led by Kerensky.  They find killer machines within a space station.  Only Kerenshy and the newbies return from that excursion.<br /><br />Then Jenkins presents his theory that the Intrepid universe is based on a television show sometime in the past.  He thinks that the red shirt factor is a gimmick to heighten suspense before a commercial break  He also believes that the show is poorly written.<br /><br />He show statistics about other ships in the Dub U fleet.  Then he shows the UFPS Enterprise and describes Star Trek.  Jenkins believes that the show about the Intrepid was a copy of Star Trek.<br /><br />This tale portrays a situation fraught with danger for the crew of the Intrepid.  Dhal searches for a way to reduce the risk.  Everbody else tella him that there isn't any way to change things, but Dhal keeps looking.<br /><br />The story terminates with a literal bang (although soundless in space).  The main tale is strange enough, but it is followed by three scenes featuring people connected to the television show.  In some respects, these are better than the main tale.  At least they aren't as morouse.<br /><br />With this conclusion, there won't be a sequel.  However, the author promoses to write more works the readers continue to buy his books.<br /><br />Highly recommended for Scalzi fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of armed conflict, plot twists, and interesting characters.  Read and enjoy!<br /><br />-Arthur W. Jordin
B008602KQI|5.0|This was so entertaining. And the actress is of course very talented having one the Oscar this year for her follow up performance in her second movie. Not part of the Hunger Games series.
B004PGO25O|5.0|Simple, clear, concise, and effective outlook and strategy for any and all projects and ventures -- whether personal or professional.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|sets, costumes, pacing, dialogue....you name it and this show has it...just be sure to ONLY catch the unedited UK version...luckily we read reviews first so we knew not to see the PBS version which is not very well edited...we just started watching this last month and are two shows from being caught up...we will definitely be going thru withdrawal waiting for the new season....if only all TV were like this....
B008602KQI|5.0|I have to be honest. Thi first time I saw the movie, I was a tad disapointed, keep comparing it to the book.  I watched it a second time puting the book out of my mind. The movie poped then for me. Loved it, would recomend it to all.
B004D23BRU|5.0|Beautiful animation. A mix of modern and timeless art direction. Once the music starts in earnest, the synchronization of animation to music is wonderful. Moments of humor. A lesson in dealing with bullies. A bit of food chain. And a nice lesson in humanity.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'm not entirely sure what it is about Americans' obsession with shows about the British.  Whatever it is, I count myself among those who enjoy it.  It's easy to get involved with the characters and the plot is always twisting and turning.  I wonder if the British are obsessed with American reality shows and try to talk in an American accent for entertainment??
1881273377|5.0|Excellent tool to use to understand yourself and others and the potential to bring you closer to your loved ones.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 2 has more unexpected happens than season 1.  Maggie Smith still provides the wit and wisdom that keeps you waiting for her next scene.
B0017HEX76|5.0|Really liked this movie I don't think the kids of today would get into it though.<br /><br />Will definitely watch it over again.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I do not normally like &#34;video&#34; games,but my son and I kept handing his kidle fire back and forth as we were playing.....I felt like a teenie bopper....we laughed and laughed...priceless.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I read this book after recommendations from multiple friends, and in the end, it was much better than I expected.  Partly a study in cultural anthropology, partly an adventure tale, this story is amazing, and hard to believe, except that it is true.  I would recommend this book to any athlete, but especially anyone who runs, at any level, any age.
B007JNWJMI|5.0|Not like most photo editing apps I've seen. There's not only many effects to choose from but also the amount you would like to apply them, frames, captions, word bubbles, etc. On my phone I have to mix about four different apps to get what I do on here (I'm using this on my kindle fire) and its less time consuming. Worth the money!

B004W2UBYW|5.0|It was an absolute pleasure to read and a very interesting look at the history of a very interesting man.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great writing love this book, and the movie is great too. Nicholas Sparks know just how to capture the female audience.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I am very happy I finally read this book. It was an enjoyable read and if you enjoyed it I would also recommend the film!
1616550414|5.0|For anyone who is a Legend if Zelda fan, this book will entertain! I couldn't out the book down and I love the comic art the end that ties into The LoZ: Skyward Sword. Color pages and concept art are sure to be enjoyed. It's very interesting to see what was set aside and not put into the games. I find myself paging through the book frequently. This is a must buy!
B009MJU9RE|5.0|This grizzly bear seems to be giving a warning to anyone coming his way. His coloring is very realistic and I love the way he is styled. His feet look good on top but flip him over and they are great. He has wonderful soles of his feet. They are silver in color and show exactly how a footprint track would like. I have only one complaint. He seems a little small in stature but he may be a young bear.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|I like this app, but there are some small details i find annoying. First, it asks you if you want to upgrade EVERY TIME you open it. Second, when the alarm rings, the snooze button and off button are kinda small and right next to each other so it is easy to hit the wrong one. Third, i wish it would light up when it rings so i wouldn't have to search for the power button on my kindle in the dark. Like i said, small details. Other than those, this is a very good, effective app. Especially for free.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|classic movie purchased new & was shipped very timely. would def. purchase this again. this movie is a classic the entire family can enjoy
B00A80SHFM|5.0|have played this every day since purchase and only wish they included more of the songs from the original movie soundtrack
B003NS2T9G|5.0|Enjoy continuing the Torchwood story line after having it introduced in Dr. Who.  You never know what plot will come up next.  I have made it half way through the season and look forward to finishing it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Simple....yes!  But most addictive......this game keeps me up very late at night!!  So hard to put down!!  One of the very BEST Solitaire games out there!!
0618871713|4.0|Alison Bechdel is clearly a very poignant and insightful writer, a maverick chronicler of the gay experience. Her relationship with her father is conveyed throughout Fun Home with exceptional poise and using the medium to her full advantage (shrinking panels for an important car-bound conversation late in the book for instance really works the tension). Each image is carefully rendered to provide an emotional punch and for the most part the narrative stings with mordant and merciless wit. There are a glut of literary allusions: Fitzgerald (with whom Alison's father is notably infatuated), Joyce (whose magnum opus Ulysses carries the book to its stunning circuitous conclusion), Wilde and Proust (for obvious and rather ham-fisted reasons), and a host of lesser-known queer writers like the indispensable Kate Millet. While this is certainly a story packed full of academics, most of them cruising between clandestine encounters (a house full of autistics, Bechdel playfully laments), begging for something more , there is an implication that the writer in question is maybe, possibly, a tiny tiny bit too in love with her own voice. As I read Fun Home (devoured it really in one long sitting, smiling, crying, etc), it began to become obvious that the narrative track was going to choke-slam every panel, allowing very little room for interpretation. I don't know if I've read a comic that was so light on stand-alone imagery. With the exception of a lonely three, every panel gets a description, most of them incredibly alliterative. To make matters worse, some of these panels are jammed full of language which is doubtlessly verbose, even a bit, dare I say, pedantic. Words like ledgermain and demiglace are fine, the latter used cleverly as a way to describe congealing NYC odors, but when, for instance, the locusts descend on suburbia, it is a stretch to refer to their mating as both &#34;the ambient noise of their conjugal exertions&#34; and &#34;some collective libidinal impulse, unleashing it into the atmosphere.&#34; Elsewhere, referring to a drive home from camping as &#34;a postlapasarian melancholy&#34; seems a tad grandiose. Of course, this is a story about language, about linguists (the dictionary is drawn up more than a few times), and, as I've said, academia (Oberlin graduates should look out for a panel containing a certain library hallmark) as much as it is a story about death and gay life and father/daughter relations, so the inflated language can, to a degree, be excused, particularly when the narrative itself is so rich with identifiable themes, interesting characters, and pictorial emotion. Bechdel is without a doubt a masterful of her form and this kuntstlerroman is a perfect example of her genius. Compact but bristling with delicious prose and themes that wouldn't feel out of place in all of those books the author shamelessly name-drops.
B001UTW7QU|3.0|Good enough.  It's not the most believable story line and over-acting is distracting.  We haven't made it through the first season.  Hope it gets better.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|Some (OK, most!) trilogies are hard-pressed to create a third movie of quality. Heck, sequels are rarely that great. That said, the Men In Black series definitely lost its charm by the third movie. I know that the original should be applauded for it's cheesy humor and weird aliens, but the novelty fades when it's the same &#34;gimmick&#34; by the third movie.
B0074V3712|5.0|This book relates observational evidence of behavior to animal and human nature  convincingly and then integrates the findings of the author and others in a coherent look at life. It comments on why we behave as we do, and shows that some behaviors have ancient origins.  That is why we have a hard time changing behavior. Some things that we often wonder about are looked at critically, such as the warlike behavior of homo sapiens. There are enough surprises to keep the book in hand for hours. I suspect that the people who ought to pay attention will never read this book.
B003ES5ZPK|2.0|This device is a novel concept, but it's pretty much destined to fail. As with all &#34;machines&#34; (or technology), moving parts are problematic. The less of them you have, the better. Bends in cables are especially problematic, because it directly interferes with signal transfer. There's (presently) no way around it. It's simply the law of physics and modern science. With how cheap these were, I figured I'd go ahead and try a couple for my new home theater setup.<br /><br />The first one I received was faulty out of the box. The signal would come through totally interrupted (e.g. solid green and random &#34;pixels&#34;). If you were *lucky,* you could wiggle it enough to randomly see the actual image. Even then, it was typically off-colored. No prob! Amazon offered their usual awesome customer service: no-questions-asked return and free replacement. However, it goes to show the quality you're going to expect with this kind of product.<br /><br />After getting my replacement, I (theoretically) had two fully functional adapters. I installed them right away with my setup, and I experienced no noticeable issues. Now, it's important to note that I'm not utilizing them for some type of setup that involves frequent movement. I'm simply using them as &#34;customizable joints&#34; of sorts. I want the HDMI cables coming and going in/out of my receiver to be able to &#34;L&#34; in various directions – to allow me to store the unit more flush against the wall. That said, the very minimal movement they experienced over the course of about two months already has the second adapter malfunctioning. On occasion (e.g. random days), the signal will cut out intermittently. I have to play with the adapter a bit to alleviate the issue. After I get it &#34;situated,&#34; it will work fine the rest of the day and for a couple of days. It'll randomly act up and need readjusted a few days later.<br /><br />The product is still within the return period, but I'm not going to deal with it. I'm fairly confident it's just the nature of the product. I'll continue to use both of them and see how they work over time. We'll see how long they last before being &#34;useless,&#34; and I'll share what I find. The one is still fully functional with no noticeable issues, so they're batting 50/50 right now.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book brings you into the world of Mental illness and the trappings that surround it. When family members pretend or ignore the realities created by this illness they too become sick and now the whole family is negatively affected. Mathew Quick did a great job of bringing the characters to life!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|awsome game to pass the time with I use it when I'm trying to get my grandkids to sleep at night
B007SGM084|5.0|It's a must read.  The only disappointment is that it ended.  I would highly recommend this book.  It's at the top of my list.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Great actors, far out plot and good entertainment.  Sometimes it may be too real.  I am not surprised it won an oscar.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is just an excellent author. You can't get enough of Mitch Rapp.  No idea how Flynn get's the details that he has in each book, but it is super cool.  President Bush 43 once asked Flynn how he had so much information about the CIA inter workings.  And Bush apparently commented that &#34; yes, there are real guys like Rapp in the CIA&#34;.  Can't wait for the next book.
B008HK3XYK|4.0|I wish this cover had a deeper ripple to hold upright otherwise it meets all expectations.  Love the color! I would recommend to my friends.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|I already love this movie and it was nice to be able to rent and view it so easily. Great!
B008HK3XU4|4.0|This case is perfect and the price was great.  I looked at the more expensive ones and thought I would try this one.  I love the color and the ease of use.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Although the book kept my attention most of the time, I felt it was better for the teenage reader. It touched on bullying, premarital sex and promiscuity, and parental issues. However, the story jumped from adoption, kidnapping, parental sexual abuse, and on and on.<br />There were so many social issues covered in this book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is everything from romantic, to sad and about faith and love. Didn't want to put it down. Loved it
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Daniel Craig is far and away the best Bond ever. I loved this movie. The writers are doing a good job of giving us glimpses into who Bond is and why. Very well done.
B001HC8516|4.0|A fun, interesting & informative look at what we all suspected. Definitely worth reading. It'll help w heartbreak. Every girl/woman should read this.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Really enjoyed it. Can't wait to view the rest of the seasons. Would highly recommend this to anyone interested in sci-fi or fantasy themes.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It is slow and had too much narrative, but it was good. Do not know why I have to write more.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Fantastic!  Easy to see everything you need to know.  Simple to navigate.  Easy on the eyes. You can add any number of cities.  Accurate to boot!
1401937519|5.0|anita moorjani has had an experience that is phenomenal!!  i have read almost all of it and it has given me a much better outlook on life and after...thank you anita!
B00A2BTCXI|4.0|I love 2112, Im not a huge Rush fan, but I do like 3 or 4 of their albums a lot.<br /><br />This one is made in 5.1, whichs is a veru good mix, not amazing, but good, its involving, but its not as adventourous as it might have been, or as I may have liked really.<br /><br />Just as the band says, they didnt want to alter the mix, they just wanted to upgrade the soundfield and that they achieved.<br /><br />Like a friend that is also into multichannel music says: &#34;Live is not in stereo, so why the F#%& should music be in stereo&#34;<br /><br />Music is a great experience and feeling being in the middle of it is something you have to try. I wish there was more and more music, specially modern music, made in multichannel, but I guess the market is still too small (although you can see more and more bands going 5.1, but usually its older bands remixing theri old albums)
B008476HBM|5.0|I had never read this book as a young person and am really enjoying the author.  The version of writing is slow to read and comprehend, but the story is captivating.
B0057MFA42|4.0|This performance is great. The setlist is great. The video is great.<br /><br />There is nothing on this BluRay you wont like. It just brings yhou back to the early 90's to show your kids what good music was. No sound effects, false rythms or that kinda of crap. Just drums, a bass, a guitar and the best cigarrette damaged voice your ever hear. Oldschool rock how its supposed to be.<br /><br />If you ever liked Nirvana, even a little bit, get this Blu Ray and dream of better times, I never was a huge fan of Nirvana, but I enjoy every minute of this show!
B005P1YCNK|3.0|I understand the theory behind the concept, but it's delivered a little too arrogantly for me.  Lots of name-dropping...which irritates me to no end.  You shouldn't need to name-drop on every other page if you have a solid product/idea.  I do appreciate the ideas though and if you can get around the delivery, it could work well for you.
B0009PVZWI|5.0|This is what im talking about!<br /><br />Moder rock bands have to do this more and more. 5.1 or 5.0 or 4.0 is what they need to do! Live is not in stereo, why should music.<br /><br />I like Foo Fighters a lot and this recording is great, specially disc 2 which is in glorious DVD-Audio. I still cant understand why they didnt do both discs in multichannel, but at least its a step forward for the industry and the bands.<br /><br />I hope this goeas on and one and more bands release the albums in multichannel. There are some great songs (like La dy Gaga, Seal, and others) mixed, so Im sure the mixes are there and the record comapnies only have to give them a go, and, of course, people have to buy these so the make more and more.
0345803493|5.0|Good book, not what I expected though. Went from being a descent into S&M to a love story.  Quite q switch!
B009CGYO0K|1.0|You won't be able to read the e-book, download the sample and pay attention to the text, you'll notice it is small and you can't zoom in to the individual boxes. This was my second book from the same publisher with the same problem
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is a fun and colorful brain exercise that is very easy and quick to play. Different every time!
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Liked it a lot... Not perfect but a great read and easy on the kindle app. I would recommend this series.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I could read these books over and over again. Every time I read them it gets better<br />If you have not read all of them you should.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|the twists and turn were unbelieveable.  I was intrigued by all the new technology they came up with. Very unexpected.
B007U5OOT6|5.0|This movie is great. I will recommend this movie to all. Samuel Jackson is a very good actor. Great Movie; hoop-we
B009CF7GRY|4.0|Although we enjoyed the movie and felt it was entertaining, it was not nearly as good as the original.  The movie lacked that pizzazz that the original had.
B005LAII1C|4.0|Vulgar but funny. This one is definitely not for kids. Once you get used to the bear, the novelty wears off. But you do get to look at Mila Kunis throughout the film. One of the few comedies in my collection.
B007BVOEPI|2.0|I was so looking forward to seeing this, I've read all the books and loved them. The director of this series has thrown way too many naked boobs in this and no real passion to any of the sex. The acting is good though as are the costumes and sets. I will probably watch one more installment to see if makes a difference, but all and all, I think HBO could have found someone else to direct this.
B002SQFZ68|4.0|The concert is ok, though they only include some of their best songs as bonus cuts (Runaway, You Give Love a Bad Name). I mostly bought this for the documentary - love music documentaries and this one's really good. They may not be your favorite band, but Bon Jovi has been around for the better part of three decades and has some stories to tell. Great film.
B0017XD3OY|5.0|This is coming from a person who only saw the movie. Will Smith is such a great actor. Movie has a great story and was well put together.
B00BHMEALA|5.0|Great movie a must see. WINNER of best picture. I can't say enough about this movie. You have to see it for yourself.
B0013D69YE|5.0|I chose this Album because I had it a long time ago, but lost it when my first laptop crashed. When I saw it for $5 I knew I had to get it again. Its a Beautiful Album done by Beyonce, I wish I had them all.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is the best weather app out there. Most accurate one too! Makes the weather channel look like just looking out your window and guessing what the weather is going to be in the next day or two!!!!
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Some content doesn't always open. I am learning the kindle has some shortcomings or maybe I need to learn more.
B008BD9SI8|4.0|This is another followup in the world created by Joe Abercrombie following up the story from the last book in the series &#34;The heroes&#34;.<br /><br />This book is focused on the story of Shy and her mission to save her siblings from child-abducters through harsh unsettled lands. As usual Joe Abercrombie presents new proganists but include characters from previous books. This book give you an adventure where you follow the protagonist tackle obstacles and dangerous situations. Unlike previous books there isn't much facts about the outside world, you get a picture that something is happening (as it always is) but then the primary focus is on the quest.<br /><br />I enjoyed the pace and the adventure theme, the characters are livid and dialogue is good. If you enjoyed the previous books you should definitly read this aswell.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|we don't often get a view of this type of subject without Hollywood being the driving force to tell the story.
B008MPQ0R2|5.0|Classic Chinese film with some great actors. A very classy movie without skin scenes or excess violence, very enjoyable to watch.
0446343129|5.0|This book has been around for a while, but it very simply explains the damage that processed sugar is causing to us NOW. No gimmicks, nothing to sell, pure good intentions on the part of the writer.
B009G9Z08S|5.0|This was, to me, a great homage to the original &#34;dark knight&#34; lineage of Batman. While many would agree that Batman/Bruce Wayne not only has issues but an entire subscription, this feature does a fantastic job exploring those along with how Gotham has changed.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|Slow development. Paper thin characters and just as thin execution. Tommy Lee Jones might as well have been in a one man play and it probably would have been better.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|Part II picks up where part one leaves off. And if you ever wanted to see how Batman would fare in a fight with Superman, then this is a must see.
B005HSL626|5.0|Great game for all ages. Great way to pass the time. I would highly recommend this game to all gamers
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The twist in the plot was nice. I won't give away anything here but the decision on Kat's part to do what she does is revealed in a surprising way and that was good. Her conflicted feelings in the final synopsis of her life lend a depth to the story. It is not a happy ever after end, though she does have some bit of happiness. It is bittersweet and hard to fully enjoy. That gives the whole plot more &#34;meat&#34;.
0307454568|5.0|It is a shame that Mr Larsson passed away because he is a wonderful writer! I have enjoyed the trilogy very much. I am very satisfied with my copy of &#34;The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Nest&#34;. I will continue to purchase books through Amazon.com in the future.<br /><br />Lisa Coutinho
B003E8P9G0|4.0|The book was awesome but for some people it is hard to understand all the gods artifacts and amulets add well as all the stories about the gods and their hosts
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book. I hope she continues with a book from Christian's perspective. This is a must read. It's a spicy romance novel. Dealing with a life style frowned upon by many. I like the tasteful way everything is exemplified in this book. Just read it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like the game. it was free and for free it isn't bad at all! I would reccomend this game for people who like hidden object games and puzzles.
1601251505|5.0|I have been playing Dungeons and Dragons for 10 years. I have played 1st, 2nd- amd 3.5. My group decided we wanted to try our Pathfinder. The only problem was we didn't want to spend the $50 on it at a bookstore. This was a very cost effective solution. It came in quickly, was in perfect shape, and was exactly what I was hoping for. I have already ordered another and will return for all of my Pathfinder needs.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|This is a great follow-up to 'Slammed'. Shows  that life isn't easy, and the hurdles are what make it so special.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|Pros: It is very quick, lets you get into basically everything.<br /><br />Cons: The icons on the app are so small that you have to zoom in every time to make sure you click/touch the correct icon. I also wish it had instant messenger.<br /><br />Will be trying other facebook apps to see other options.
B009738XXM|5.0|We all jammed to Call Me Maybe, but I don't think anyone expected her album to be any good.  At least I didn't.  I didn't think twice about her full album until someone described it as &#34;the best pop album since old school Britney.&#34;  I think they got it exactly right.  Every song is catchy.  I listened to it on repeat for a full month after buying it.
0143036424|5.0|Anything in the Longmire series is a good read.  Craig Johnson does a great job with the characters and it is a book you won't want to put down.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|The audiobook is 33 hours and the first season is only 10.  The show does a great job of whittling the story down to the most important elements.  If you are thinking about reading the book, the show is an excellent taste to see if you'll like the story (and there is sex and war and political intrigue, so you will!).  If you enjoyed the book, I would definitely recommend the show.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Great book about the Apple founder.  It takes you through his vision of the World and how he was able to achieve so much.  It does make him appear somewhat of an a*^hole, though.  Definitely worth the read.
0375842209|5.0|I didn't think I liked historical novels, but this one blew me away.  If you ever wondered what it was like to live in Germany during the holocaust for the majority of the poor population... this is your book.  This book is narrated by death, which sounds gimmicky, but it works.  This book is heart-breaking and thought provoking, but not depressing.  It gives hope and explores love.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Purchased this book to see what all the &#34;hype&#34; was about.  It's definitely a book that grabs your attention and doesn't let go.  Good read, very entertaining, adult concepts.
B0099G3I96|2.0|I grew up on No Doubt and was very excited about their new album.  I bought it when it was on sale for $2 and I wish I had only bought the single, Push and Shove, for $0.99, because that is the only song I like.  Stefani's last solo album was far better.
B003IWRE3I|4.0|I start off this review by openly admiting that this is probably one of my top favorite personal movies. I've also ready the book by Cormac McCarthy as well so I have an extensive knowledge of the comparison and contrasts between the two (which pleasantly is not much contrast).<br /><br />Lets Begin:<br /><br />The Plot:<br />An apocalyptic disaster has struck the face of the earth to such a degree, literally everything has been destroyed. An un named man and his also un named son are seeking warmth as the climate continues to grow cold from lack of sunlight. This is their journey to the south as they attempt to try to survive in this god-forsaken world.<br /><br />**Potential Spoilers**<br />The plot's exciting enough, and I suppose the plot is also one of this movie's (and the book)'s biggest flaws. Unfortunately, for most media related folks, if you watch the trailer for this movie, you are being mislead. This movie is not an action film. (Fallout 3/Book of Eli fans should not expect action of this caliber). Instead, Cormac McCarthy offers a \\"spiritual\\" story that evokes emotion within a sad and bitter world via the plot.<br /><br />The situation is so hopeless, even the man's wife decides to commit suicide in order to end her agony instead of trying to survive. This is one of many depressing scenarios that The Road has to offer viewers and believe me, this movie is extremely depressing.<br /><br />The story plot is unfortunately very dull otherwise though. Despite having to deal with cannibals and generally surviving, other than the interactions between the father and son, there's not much that happens in this movie. You will probably find yourself bored (especially if the trailers influenced you to watch this film). The film also ends pretty abruptly in such a way that you feel a little empty when you finish the film. However...<br /><br />There are several means of interpreting this ending. Because the movie is so depressing, we find that there are some key points in presenting the themes in this movie. The idea of \\"what remains of 'humanity'\\" is central to the plot of this film and I feel that again, it's a spiritual experience in what viewers will take from the poetic set up of characters. Which leads me to the next part of the review.<br /><br />Characters: **MAJOR SPOILERS**<br />All characters in this film are un named. The only names we receive during the credits are even generalized to \\"the man\\" or \\"the boy.\\" All characters also play a central roll within this movie as well which I feel are the movie's magnificent strong points and to a certain degree, makes up for the seemingly lacking plot.<br /><br />The father is the strong figure who (as we come to find out) is the backbone for his family. He is to the viewer the deteriorating \\"human\\" voice-of-reason who is quickly diminishing as he continues in a world of blank turmoil. He's boisterous and determined to keep his family safe and alive, but eventually even he succombs to hopelessness and eventually to other things as well. He is the dying humanity looking to pass on what's left of human reason and compassion over to his son. The son acts as the \\"hope\\" and the sole bearer of his father's legacy to be human in a world where humanity is no more. Eventually even the son, as young as he is, realizes this and the movie ends as soon as he is faced with this charge.<br /><br />While most of the important characters remain prominent, a lot of the background characters are very almost \\"ghost\\" like in their presence in the film (even to the effet of the film). All the actor cameos hardly seem worth mentioning because of this as most everying (besides Robert Duvall who has maybe a 15 minute role in the film).<br /><br />Themes:<br />The above mentioned themes of humanity are discussed heavily in this film. However, it's sad because the father and son seem to be the only thing left of the proverbial \\"family\\" and that's what makes this so depressing. The father is trying toindoctrinate his son with the means to survive after he's gone.<br /><br />The relationship between the father and son are also sub-theme for this movie and provides for a slightly heartwarming (and in some ways, heartbreaking) scenario.<br /><br />The idea of the entropy of humanity is also discussed and presented. It makes anyone wonder \\"How can I survive when the world runs out of food and resources?\\"<br /><br />Differences Between the Film and Book:<br />Pleasantly there's not many differences. I feel that the few scenes that were cut from the film were most likely due to length reasons. (I believe a few of these are included as extras in the DVD film) but for the most part, the plot, characters and story arc are all the exact same way.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />The Road is not for everyone. For those looking for an action film, look elsewhere. The Road is not for you.<br /><br />For those looking for a heartwarming happy story about a man and his son, DEFINITELY do not look here.<br /><br />The folks who are looking for a poetic, moving and psychologically involving movie, look no further. The Road has a nice blend of melancholy with a realistic look on how things migh turn out via the aftermath of some apocolyptic disaster. I would think of no better movie to use as an example to discuss the ideas of \\"what would remain\\" of humanity at the end of the world, and this movie does enough justice to create a very chilling environment and experience to have you as the viewer question your own ethics in times of turmoil.<br /><br />Peace Out!!indoctrinate his son with the means to survive after he's gone.<br /><br />The relationship between the father and son are also sub-theme for this movie and provides for a slightly heartwarming (and in some ways, heartbreaking) scenario.<br /><br />The idea of the entropy of humanity is also discussed and presented.

B003INBOE2|5.0|One of the best martial arts movies of recent times. Donnie yen, who plays IP man really shows us something in this one. Spectacular action. There is also a sequel and a prequel which are both great also
0393327345|4.0|I got this for my son and he says it's awesome. Maybe I should check it out because it does sound like something I would like.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I love this book...it is great...I would recomend it to all my girlfriends<br />The story line is interesting and it is a love story ....very good writing..<br />I love all of Nicholas Sparks books and movies..<br />To me he is a great writter....
B00328G4Y8|5.0|This is classic Jimi Hendrix!! I am so glad I was able to get this and have in my collection.
B008M7BQHE|5.0|Great science based show. Great characters and their interactions are very well written. You do have to follow episode to episode to catch all the references but well worth it.
B004IYISSK|4.0|I love how this is told in the points of view of all the characters. I loved the conflict and the resolution.
B000093FLA|5.0|I saw this movie when it was originaly in theatres and I must say that I enjoyed the film tremendously. I was enthralled by the fast paced action, the characters, the setting and everything in between.<br /><br />Brad Pitt's performance was incredible and unintelligible (I Mean That As A Compliment). I had to use the subtitle option whenever he was speaking as I could barely understand any of the words he anunciated. While the film shares a similar theme with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, it has a bigger budget and a faster pace than the aforementioned film. Too, its ensemble cast really compliment one another and the movie itself.<br /><br />I won't go overly into detail on the film suffice it to say that I enjoyed it and will say that anyone who liked Pulp Fiction or 2 Days In the Valley or Get Shorty will love this film.<br /><br />A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr.
B001QKSWOE|4.0|I don't like this half-story as well as the full stories. But, it was a silly little story that had me laughing.
0399230033|5.0|My two-year old loves reading this book at bedtime and laughs at the silly gorilla with the keys. Its a great Bedtime story!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This was a gripping tale of slavery in the south. I found it very good. Towards the end, I couldn't put it down. I love how it is told in the voice of two of the main characters. Very well done!
B008K9UZY4|5.0|I 1st played as classic sonic in gems collection. then some time. later I got sonic genarations for xbox and loved both sonics<br /> you must downlod this
B000FA6720|5.0|This is much more beautiful than the movie. I loved it and could not put it down. It had me in tears.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Christopher Eccleston really kicked off the new series of Doctor Who(s) and without him the current pop culture would be lacking.  While the production quality was really kind of lacking in this season, I believe that's what started making it great.  It was the fantastic stories and character development as opposed to Hollywood trickery with bright lights and flashy things.
B006O5YI7G|5.0|This was a great movie for me.  I loved the western feel and the scenery as well as the twists of the story.  entertaining and well shot movie.
B007REV4YI|1.0|Tried to play on two different blu-ray players in my home, freezes at 7 sec mark.. Cleaned Blu-ray, no change.. Very disaapointed.. should have bought locally..
B002N5N4MG|5.0|This series is a great one to watch if you are tired of reality tv and want to see something at least a little bit intelligent.  I didn't think the blu-ray version of this season would make a difference, but it really does.  I will be purchasing future seasons in blu-ray instead of dvd.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Since John C and Paul B are involved how can this miss catching the bad guy.<br />Looking forward to another story of these two.
B008Q08IV4|3.0|I purchased this movie earlier this week as it was one of my all-time favorites and after the purchase was complete I found out that Amazon streaming does not contain subtitles.  My husband is hearing impaired and needs subtitles in order to hear everything in the movie.  Great movie, but I will not be buying many Amazon Instant Stream movies in the future because of this shortcoming.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|Please believe the negative reviews, people.<br /><br />The plot is terribly simplistic - which, by itself might not be a bad thing if done properly, but unfortunately, it's not supported by any sort of human interest or clever perspectives.<br /><br />The one good thing about the film, is Dredd's noble &#34;uphold-the-law-at-all-cost&#34; attitude, but such a theme can (and has been) wrapped in better, more entertaining packages (see 3:10 to Yuma with Christian Bale, for example).<br /><br />I'd be willing to forgive the shallowness if, in return, we were given incredible action sequences, but there, the movie falls flat as well.  There isn't even a decent fist fight the entire time (for those of us who love watching choreography).  Nope - Dredd just walks around (stiffly, I might add), shooting people with his little gun.<br /><br />At one point, some rouge judges are called in to take out Dredd.  He nonchalantly shoots them, without much trouble.  Then nonchalantly shoots the rest of the bad guys.  His partner, the &#34;rookie&#34; has psychic powers but that interesting characteristic is never developed.  They literally just walk around shooting.  The end. No high-flying hover-bike chases, no insane, death-defying leaps, no major explosions, no incredible martial arts ... nothing.  Just a little bit of uninspired gun-play.<br /><br />Hollywood must think we're all a bunch of whores who have to accept whatever they shovel our way.<br /><br />So, don't be a whore.  Save your money, because this movie isn't even entertaining.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Excellent, maybe not quite season 1 but I burned through the whole season in about 3 days. Can't wait for third
B00119ZMKW|5.0|This was better then I remember! I will be watching all these! Then I will have to hit up Mcgyver!!!
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I purchased this on my Kindle HD, and watch any time I get a free 5 minutes or more. I have watched all but the last episode of the season in a week. Can't wait for the day to be over so I can see the last episode!
B001HM1PFO|5.0|Such a fantastic film. I joined the shadow cast for rocky horror so now I can watch it all the time :D
B00BGDQNLU|5.0|Finally Warner Bros has given the hidden gem of the Coen Bros the Blu Ray treatment that I'll certainly add to my collection. This film will have you laughing all the way to the 44th floor...45 counting the mezzanine! It's a wonderful tribute to the classic working class comedies of Preston Sturges and Frank Capra from the 40's. Jennifer especially gives a knockout performance in a great Katharine Hepburn impression as a fast talking girl Friday type undercover reporter Amy Archer. It tanked in theatres but die-hard Coen Bros fans love this buried treasure. If you love the screwy comedy of the Coen Bros less so than Raising Arizona though still one of their best then order The Hudsucker Proxy. You'll really love it. Sure, sure!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I can usually figure out the plot pretty early on but this book had me on the edge til the end!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Good, clean and entertaining. Doesn't insult your intelligence. You observe people from several walks of life. You hear what they really feel, think.
B00A757EFW|3.0|IF YOU PLAYED THIS WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER YOU WILL GET A KICK OUT OF IT. .MAYBE YOU CAN MASTER IT NOW IF YOU DIDN'T IN THE PAST.
B0050Q3TDY|3.0|okay, could have more of a selection.  i listen to it occasionally, as long as it doesn't take any room on my reader its ok
B004JZBGWI|4.0|VERY CONVENIENT I'M GLAD I FOUND IT, ITS JUST WHAT I NEED. I'M ALWAYS RUNNING AROUND DOING A MILLION THINGS. THIS HELPS KEEP ME ORGANIZED.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|We used to play this in middle school. This version is different, but I like it.  The only things I do not like are at several points in the game you must use REAL money to build things or you can not grow your town, also you need energy for everything and it takes 3 minutes to get 1 energy.  I left the game for almost 24 hours and only got 28 energies.  Oh well fun game to pass the time.
B008L1DNGI|2.0|I'm sure it's me but I just didn't get it. I actually think angry bird which the kids are hooked on is much better.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|Nice reading! If you like a good thriller that hooks you till the end, than this is the book for you.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|One of the best tv comedy series of the last decade. If you're a comedy fan, How I Met Your Mother is &#34;LEGENDARY&#34;
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like the game but it needs flint'n'steel in create mode because I want to blow things up I tried in survival mode but the zombies came and got me when I was about to light the TNT so I want it in create mode.
B00594XOZU|4.0|This app is good but it really needs to support kik cards. Update please!! If it had kik cards life would be complete.
B00821OX98|5.0|If you like sci-fi and alien invasion stuff this is good show. I also like the \\"government\\" issues in season two.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love this game, it's so cute and very fun to play!!!!!!! I love horses, it's so addicting. I'm sure you will love it too.
034580404X|4.0|After hearing so many comments I was glad I could find it. I had to order off the Internet as every place was sold out. If you like kinky sex you will like these books.
B003EVWDR0|4.0|I think I'm the only person on the planet that hadn't seen Avatar.  I can't believe it took me so long.  It was imaginative, inventive and breath-taking.  The Cinematography was gorgeous.  I've had to control myself and not watch again this week, because the kids can't wait to come over on Friday night to see it.  DONT MISS IT!!!
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|I'm a fan of the Bourne series and this one just doesn't measure up. The first half is exciting and fun and interesting, especially while in Alaska--the wolf thing was pretty creative. I was just about buying this guy as a 'Bourne' type and then they hop a plane and end up in Manila, and then it just gets stupid. Lots of holes in the plot. Chasing pills/drugs and 'virusing out' is just hard for me to believe the way it was presented. The villian in Manilla with his sunglasses and white pants was just ridiculous and i didn't buy it. And it didn't all come together at the end, the ending was weak. Didn't leave a cliffhanger for another one like past movies in this series. Not that I would see a follow up to this one.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|My expectations may have been too high, but this film was boring and didn't make sense from start to end. Two stars for Javier Bardem.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Takes lots of time for things to load and has annoying pop ups. Also you can't earn as many coins as you have to spend.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I was expecting an over the top action movie but it was a thoughtful well acted movie.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have seasons 1 and 2, and season 3 was super.  This series is one of my very favorites.  I love the characters, and the costumes.  The British really do a great job with period pieces.1
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love having books on my phone.  I always have my phone.  Any time I have  too wait for a Doctor or have a lapse at work I just pull out my phone and read.  I lost my book off the phone once and was able to sign in my amazon account and retreive my book without any problems.
B004H4XL7E|3.0|Well, this is an OK book. Some things you can definitely use.<br />But you have to get through tons of too much high self indulgence done by the writer.<br />It is a bit of how to be a cowboy, mixed with little bits of pseudo neuro-science.<br />Saying that... the book depict some situations that you as a reader, really don't know what to do with them....<br />The chapter with the author getting bak his friend's money is just.... over the top. Obviously he didn't meet any alpha male on that situation, or he and his friend will be taken by the back door.<br />Not a bad book, but certainly you will find better material out there<br />You better red \\"Thinking fast and slow by Mr. Daniel Kahneman. Will take you more time, but you will get your money back for each minute you invested.<br />Another better and shorter option is \\"You are not so smart\\" by by David McRaney..
B009CCBCU4|5.0|Could not put this down. Despite some need to look at the map of the territories a few times to keep the various people sorted out , I enjoyed it and need to read more in this series
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I really enjoy comic book movies. This on was phenomenal and held my attention to the end. If you are a fan - watch this one!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use and works well.  I have used it several times.  It has several useful functions as well.  I like this calculator very much!!
B0093Q9SCS|5.0|I love, love, love this movie.  Gerard Butler AND Jeffrey Dean Morgan in the same movie and in Ireland. What more could I ask for?
0062238868|5.0|i had a very hard time putting this book down. It gave a great perspective into his life. I reccomend this book
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I wasn't sure how it was gonna be because I have all the books and this is the first one I got on my kindle fire and I have learned it is just as good if not better!
B0023S50DO|4.0|One can watch this while half asleep and still enjoy the popcorn. I enjoyed watching the actors grinding out the script with their practiced skills trying to make their characters believable. Worked, somewhat.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I just finished watching this movie, and it made me cry. It's a beautiful film, explicit but tasteful and based on true story and an article published in The Sun Magazine (May 1990) by Mark O'Brien entitled, &#34;On Seeing a Sex Surrogate.&#34; Throw away any preconceived notions and watch this film.
B00A32CKKI|5.0|I just watched this movie for possibly the tenth time since the late forty's.  I even read the book during my Steinbeck period in junior high.  Too bad, the circumstances  and the social stigma of the time are ,at present, completely unfathomable to most people.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I never did watch this when it was first on TV, but now that I am hooked on Downton Abbey, I thought that I would watch Upstairs, Downstairs.  Needless to say, I can't wait to watch the next episode.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|The case looks cool but the the plastic piece at the bottom that helps seal the cord charger already broke! (Had it less than 3 weeks).
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Gripping story but sad to be reminded there are folks so wrapped up in self-medicating activities. And it's hard to imagine that a pilot could get away with flying drunk very many times. Denzel did his usual great acting job.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|Awsome game me and my son fight to play. Graphics are really good. Works great on kindle fir. Its a little challenging but worth it and great to pass time.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I haven't read a book yet that I didn't like from Nicholas Sparks and this book was no exception.  I loved it and couldn't put it down.  I think I read it in record time.  What's not to like.  It is just a good book.  Yes I would recommend it to friends and already have.  Not sure I should have read it before going to the movie.  Both movie and book are good, just different.  Go to the movie and YES still read the book.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is a really fun game. Its great on kindle fire graphics are awsome. Only bad thing is not enought levels.
B005JR47R6|5.0|I won't belabor my point. I'm 59 years old, as I write this,  so I'll simply say that &#34;House&#34; is and will probably remain my favorite medical drama of all time. Hugh Laurie was brilliant, the supporting cast flawless and many of the stories delighted the inner &#34;Sherlockian&#34; within me. I doubt it, but if David Shore ever brought House back from the &#34;grave&#34; I'd be right there watching.
B009MCRHH6|3.0|its really fun but a little difficult. works great on kindle fire and graphics are nice. Good app to pass time.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault In Our Stars is, by far, one of the best books I've read in a long time. John Green has really outdone himself.<br /><br />This is a beautiful story of life, love, and two young people trying to figure out what is life.<br /><br />I give this boom a million stars. Truly amazing!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of the best books I've read in sometime.  Nicholas Sparks has done it again.  Great Book!!  Highly recommend this book.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I have always been a James Bond fan. Daniel Craig  does a good job. Sean Connery  will always be my favorite
B00BIQU1K4|5.0|A great philosopher once said: \\"The principal mark of genius is not perfection but originality...\\"  and STEVEN WILSON'S new album THE RAVEN...is both perfect and original!!!  From LUMINOL (one kickin' cool song) to the mellow, climactic title track, this is one fantastic ride!...Reminiscent of the best in Prog Rock: King Crimson, YES, ELP, Genesis, Jethro Tull, Pink Floyd AND some Mahavishnu Orchestra for good measure, this here LP is a masterpiece!  Truly one of the greatest Prog Rock albums ever recorded.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|Great page turner and definitely worth reading but I must say that I liked some of the earlier Harry Hole novels better. Sill a good book.
B00821PCJS|5.0|A great diversion from the cop shows on TV.  Realistic and thoughtful with family basic's, a bit of action and romance.
B004OC07GM|2.0|I got bored halfway through the introduction. Not sure if I've ever read a book that gave a lengthier overview of the latter chapters of itself. I found myself wandering off. When I finally got to the meat of the book I thought way too much time was spent going over the intricacies of the disk drive market and not enough was spent supporting the book's thesis.<br /><br />Graphs also were hard to read on the Kindle.
B0072OFM28|4.0|Having watched HBO's \\"Rome\\" a few months back, I had to get \\"Spartucus\\", & its follow-up \\"Vengeance\\", the production values on this one is awesome, you really feel like you are back there in 70 B.C. watching the action unfold,  this one is more action packed & quite different from the first one, although many feel Liam McIntyre struggled to replace Andy Whitfield, I felt he did the best he could do filling Whitfield's shoes & made the character his own, I didn't have a problem with his performance, as many have pointed out, the arena destruction is awesome & well done, this one revolves around the freed Gladiators fighting & trying to overthrow the Romans, with many action battle sequences, & yes, we get more nudity & sex in various scenes, one thing this one does quite well is show us how brutal the Romans were, whereas in \\"HBO's Rome\\" we only got a touch of it, where two Roman soldiers were unlikely heroes, here the Romans are anyyhing but, Graig Parker's portrayal of the Roman general Gladus is parallel to Jason Isaacs' brutal British general in Mel Gibson's \\"The Patriot\\", I don't know which is more brutal, like that one he kills anyone who gets in his way or challenges him, Viva Bianca returns as his scheming wife as does Lucy Lawless who parallel Joan Collins & Linda Evans on \\"Dynasty\\" as they constantly try to out manuever one another, I was disappointed that Mira (Katrina Law) & Spartucus' relationship didn't go anywhere, & Dustin Clare returns from the prequel \\"Gods of War\\", & is this show's anti-hero who is a loner that plays both sides to his own advantage, all in all this one delivers the goods, however there are some things that really bugged me about this one, the blood & gore scenes are a little overdone as if the filmakers got a little bit carried away with the CGI blood  shots, & did we really need to see a innocent slave girl crusified, an orgy massacre, one by Spartucus & then one by the Romans, or a captured gladiator tortured & skinned alive by some aritocrats at a party function, another pretty girl crusified off camera & the big whopper....a new character (won't spoil it here) gets her throat cut & spills a waterfall of blood( come on, man) , I realize that the filmakers were trying to show us the brutality of the time, but these scenes were overkill in my view, HBO's Rome\\" carefully avoided going overboard with scenes like this, why couldn't \\"Spartucus\\"? even the previous season  \\"Blood & Sand\\"  kept it simple, other than these rants, it is a great conclusion & every one of the villians get what they deserve in the end which is quite satisfying, don't know if I will care for the next one \\"Village of the Damned\\" which features a young Julius Ceaser who looks nothing like Ceaser in \\"HBO's Rome\\", I know the filmakers don't have honor \\"Rome\\", but this is the same audience that has watched \\"Rome\\", it couldn't have hurt, instead \\"Spartucus\\" Ceaser is a rip off of Brad Pitt's character from \\"Troy\\"..(watch the trailer)....don't know if I will even care about the next one, but \\"Blood & Sand\\" & Vengeance\\" are worth owning & highly recommened & a good companion to HBO's Rome\\".
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I walked into this film knowing nothing of the story line.  By the end I was stunned, knew I had just witnessed a life so special. Certain  circumstances of Rodriguez life broke my heart but what is interesting is that it didn't break his.<br />A must see film.
B009K0OL06|5.0|Season one is still my favorite and season two there are a few things that leave you with &#34;OH COME ON&#34; and it feels as if they are working too hard to stretch out the series.  I still watch each episode as it airs and I encourage you to watch this series.
B005K17RU0|4.0|The daily forecast is very skimpy.  A little more detail would make it one of the very best apps out there.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I love the book and its perfect for kindle fire Greg is very funny and I think you can read it easily
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great series, with all the humdrum repeats, its nice to have something new to sink your teeth into.....................no pun intended!!!
159413586X|5.0|Very good ending to this trilogy. Enjoyed all 3 books. Characters are very believeable. Would recommend series for any age groupl
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was AMAZING! I loved it. It wad very inspirational. I have to say it's been the best book I've read.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|So enjoyable to listen to. Her songs are unique. It is nice to understand the words to her songs and not hear screeching.

B003INBOEM|5.0|Donnie Yen blew me away with his performance in this movie.  I am a huge fan of Yen's and although his acting skills in previous movies have never jumped to the top of the list of what I love about him, they are on full display here.  For most of us that crave Martial Arts action in movies, we have to lower our expectation of plot and character development, and we know there probably isn't going to be an award winning dramatic performance by the guy going around kicking people's you know what.  There are a few exceptions to this and Ip Man is without a doubt one of those.<br /><br />I didn't know much about the real story of Ip Man so I can't say too much about the historical accuracy of this movie.  I can guess that some creative license was taken but in the end I wasn't watching this looking for a documentary.  What we do get is brilliant acting, awesome fight choreography, character development, and a very moving story.  This is easily my favorite martial arts movie moving Jet Li's Fearless into spot #2.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I enjoyed season 1, but Season 2 was even better. Thanks to amazon Prime for offering this great series free. Season 3 is currently only available for a cost, so prepare yourself to pay or wait when you finish this season.

B001UGB1X8|4.0|Well acted. Confusing ending but enjoyed getting there. The visuals were beautiful and the dialog sharp. How many more words do I need?
B0081336FO|5.0|Absolutely amazing!!!<br />The first season was already outstanding, but season 2 upped the ante considerably.  Even though they're all standalone stories, each one is on a new level from Season 1.<br /><br />A Scandal in Belgravia - Absolutely amazing, possibly the best of the three and the whole series so far.<br />The Hounds of Baskerville - A lot different than other eps as it takes place outside of London.  Was a great watch.<br />The Reichenbach Fall - My favorite... the ultimate showdown :)<br /><br />If you've watched Season 1 you don't need to be told that you should watch Season 2 as you already know how great Sherlock is.
8866130974|4.0|This is a great calendar...high quality cover/pages. But I was not aware it was going to be that small. Even looking back at the product description, I don't see any dimensions listed. I know it says &#34;X-Small&#34; but would be nice to have the actual size listed more prominently in the description.
B003NRYMZQ|4.0|Had the chance to see this series on cable tv in 2011. I later found out that is was a popular series over in Europe. I found it on Amazon Prime and love it.
6305754969|4.0|Just as I remember it.  Got here in a timely manor and was well packaged.  It was a bit scratched but worked.  Brought back memories from childhood.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great for knowing how much battery you have left, and not just in general, but in specific detail: music, video, reading, etc.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|The streaming quality even on Amazons own player was very poor.<br /><br />It will be a while before I purchase another instant video.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Outstanding program in all respects. The only problem is sometimes the show stops in the middle for several seconds before resuming. Gave it five stars anyway.
B00130UFY2|5.0|We downloaded this and enjoyed it immensely.  Love all the Bourne movies. Great action and mystery. Its a must see.
B0095P29EG|4.0|A lot of fun.  Another in the great series of Marvel movies.  One of the films that was a lead up to the Avengers.
B007TK77QE|4.0|I really liked this book.<br />From her descriptions of the characters you can really recognise J.K. Rowling from her excellent Harry Potter books.<br />It's an intriguing book, with great and compelling characters.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very exciting. a real page turner. looking forward to the movie.<br />a good book to curl up with. all nicholas sparks.
B008JOLG7U|2.0|I looked high, I looked low; I even looked in-between each track, but still couldn't find them.  Find what?  Her other hits.  Her many other hits.  Her many, many, many other hits.<br /><br />This was supposed to be a HITS record, right?<br /><br />Well, the producers placed B-Tracks, Filler Tracks, and should I say, Tracks that should have stayed in the Recording Studio - and for what?<br /><br />To make money?  Not sure about that since Miss J. Lo is already a wealthy woman.<br /><br />So I'm going to wait for a TRUE Hits record by one of my Favorite Artists of the day, my Favorite Dance Recording Artist of the Day - Ms. Jennifer Lopez - the AMAZINGLY WONDERFUL, and MULTI-Talented, \\"J LO\\".<br /><br />K
1400052181|5.0|The true life story of Henrietta Lacks.  The science part wasn't too overwhelming and the parts of her life were very interesting.  My heart ached for her and her family.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I don't normally read romance novels but after being recommended this book by all my girlfriends and finally my sister, I decided to give it a try.  Personally, I found the sex scenes hot and exciting but not over the top and not offensive.  And the book seemed more a girl's coming of age love story (and redemption story for the hero Christian, etc.) and not just some trashy sex story.  I highly recommend to others.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Even though I knew the ending, it was still gripping.  Very interesting true story.  There is  a reason it won the Academy Award!

B00BHMETKC|4.0|Argo was a very good movie and the drama and danger came through in a very gripping way.  Best Picture.....no but at the top for 2012, absolutely.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Entertainment, suspense, and enchantment all in one show!  Be sure to view seasons 1 and 2 first.  You will love it!
044024630X|5.0|I do not want to have to enter x-numbrer of words just to provide a rating on a book.  So there.
B0095P29EG|5.0|What can I say! If you like the Hulk, Ironman, Captain America, and Avengers, you will like this as well. This movies is a good test of you DTS system. Worth watching since it is a key part of the Avengers Movies. Hope to have many more in the future.
B004WGIXX4|1.0|stopping, I decided to move to Netflix which played the movie without any pauses for through out. I'm sorry but that proved to me that your servers are not very good.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Gillian Flynn has a great talent for giving us flawed heroines, who we never feel sorry for, but wind up caring about. Libby Day certainly fits that description. At the end of all the twists and turns, the truth is revealed, but the ending is not a happy one, all tied up with a big bow. The path is littered with the lives of many.<br /><br />I gave this book 3 stars, simply because I read her other books first, and feel they were better than this one.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Being a fan of some of the actors in here I was not disappointed and enjoyed this movie.<br />Sent in great condition and sent very quickly I would order from this seller again thank you.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this version. At times the adds are difficult to get past. The game includes popular versions of solitaire.
B002CAWNEM|5.0|Good Movie I enjoyed it Beyonce was not bad in it I have recommended it to friends<br />If you have not seen it could provide some fun entertainment for the night<br />Sent in condition exactly as seller stated and sent very quickly I would order from them again thank you
B007EECSFA|5.0|Very easy reading. enjoyed the story from one story teller telling the story then the other. The book seemed like this could of happened in the war. Very exciting ending. Would recommend this book
B00006LSHO|1.0|I ordered on the 17 still havent recieved it . On top of that I just saw the thing about it being  region 2 . I looked it up and it says it might not even play when I get it. Not happy at all. Maybe you can explain that it might not play on all players do to region . I guess this is fare to say thanks for nothing.
B00821OX98|5.0|everything about this series is fantastic. the story line the acting the writing cinematography everything. let's hope it continues. wonderful just wonderful.
0071766588|5.0|Absolutely, it is the most comperhensive book for preparing for TOEFL Test. Don't lose your time looking for another material. It is the best, because it is authored by the people who make the test.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|I didn't have this in my collection of Depeche Mode CDs.  I guess I have a few more to purchase.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read many books about trips to heaven and this was by far the best. I come from a science background and the science it this book to it to another level.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Love this series! But, is this it?? There are so many characters yet that need the rest of their stories told. Please, say there is more to come.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Love how the flowers all had meaning.  I will do more research on The Language Of Flowers.  Will/have recommend this book to family and friends.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful acting, costumes and great period period show- the English know how to produce a series. Hope you have  season 3 on soon!
B006WQLH7G|1.0|See above reason for explanation.<br />There are no pros and a very large con.<br />I downloaded a weak- weakened Norton app.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|While the story was well-woven, it was a bit light on actual scares.  My small pet peeves include when people are searching a darkened house and simply refuse to flick on a light switch to see what is going on ( this movie had a case of chronic darkness ).  I know it's for effect, but I just couldn't get around it.  Also, the local deputy was a bit of an inept charicature who ends up delivering more solid information in the movie than anyone else, not sure why they designed him that way.  I enjoyed Ethan Hawke ( although they never give him a wardrobe change ), and it was good to see Fred Thompson and Vincent D'Onofrio included ( albeit uncredited ).<br /><br />The ending did tie is up neatly in a bow, but it's like the whole movie was designed just to deliver the ending, and kind of missed throughout.  The key pieces to the story, the local police's warnings, the son's night terrors, and the girl's 'friend', were all kinda glossed over, which left the substance of the story somewhat light.  Ironically, it is not a short movie, checking in at just under two hours, so I felt there was time to deliver more.<br /><br />The violence itself was graphic and suspensefully delivered, but it wasn't enough to make it genuinely scary.  Granted, it avoided some of the pitfalls of other supernatural horror films, but it felt like The Believers meets Blair Witch, and the result was just 'okay'.
B00008OP0H|5.0|I have seen the series several times and had to have my own set. It is very well done and authentic.
1401938906|5.0|If you think, like I did, that this is another book just like all the others you have read about inspiration, spirituality, and self-improvement, you could not be more wrong.<br /><br />Heck, even if it were  like the rest, that in itself would still be awesome support and reinforcement.  But. It's. Better.<br /><br />This is support for moving from theory into action.  From knowing to experiencing.  I can learn all I want about the field of potentiality (FP), but until I live it I haven't yet understood it.  This book gives nine simple experiments that anyone can do, using scientific processes so that we can prove to ourselves that we each have an active role in our relationship to this energy.<br /><br />Pam's writing style is very down-to-earth, relaxing, and funny.  It's a great read, a series of truly scientific experiments disguised as a conversation with someone you discover you want to spend more time with.  E-Squared allows an individual to successfully prove the following, and I am not kidding:<br /><br />1. There is an invisible energy force or field of infinite possibilities.<br /> 2. You impact the field and draw from it according to your beliefs and expectations.<br /> 3. You, too, are a field of energy.<br /> 4. Whatever you focus on expands.<br /> 5. Your connection to the field provides accurate and unlimited guidance.<br /> 6. Your thoughts and consciousness impact matter.<br /> 7. Your thoughts and consciousness provide the scaffolding for your physical body.<br /> 8. You are connected to everything and everyone else in the universe.<br /> 9. The universe is limitless, abundant, and strangely accommodating.<br /><br />These are ideas that you may have read about and even experienced; this book will prove it for those that need it, and for those who may just need a reminder.<br /><br />I received this book from Hay House in trade for my unbiased opinion of it.  Way to go, everyone--good group effort!
B0006GVJEE|5.0|I am not a big movie reviewing type person, so nothing on the plot or cinematography, but seriously a great movie.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Es un increible album de tool, me encanto el diseño de alex grey y lo hermoso que esta organizado. lo recomiendo totalmente.
1416955070|5.0|The book is great im not much of a reader but im enjoying this book ,I purchases the other to books,gant wait to read them.
B00170I7GG|5.0|We felt nostalgic about this movie and decided to watch it again, after not having seen it for years. It is a funny, interesting movie about a weatherman who is bit of a jerk, but who gets the chance to redeem himself, over and over again until he gets it right. It is set in Punxsutawney Pennsylvania, where he and his crew are covering the Groundhog Day story. We enjoyed it as much this time as in previous years. It's a sweet comedy with some depth that points out that everyday gives us the opportunity to get it right.
B0049P1N3K|4.0|Good followup to The Secret.  Byrne's theory makes much common sense and is helpful on many levels.  A few comments such as the Ancients stating humans used to live hundreds of years seem out of place but overall a very interesting and enlightened book.
B003B02PF4|4.0|Something a bit different for one of his attorney novels.  Well wrtiien and very engaging.  After several mediocre attorney stories, Grisham has hit his stride again.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is great for adults & teens.  It's a real page-turner and I loved it from beginning to end.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Usual Bond twists and turns.  Not my favorite of the series but quite entertaining. Always enjoy a nice Bond adventure.
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|The movie was okay and the streaming was pretty good.  Only one interuption and that could have been my internet connection.
B000HF6ZR0|3.0|Pretty good movie for a slow night when you want to watch something on tv and nothing is on.  Kind of cool to see Samuel L. Jackson, Sharon Stone and Dustin Hoffman in this sci-fi flick.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I have tried almost every weather app, and I keep coming back to this one. It is visually beautiful and simple to use and access. I use it both on my phone and tablet, and works great on both devices. Even the Status Bar weather forecast is perfect (just need to add option to invert the High/Low :)  Very responsive developer as well. Give this one a shot.
B00A3CVFMM|5.0|Love love love this soundtrack! Howard shore delivers a great listen yet again! It has an obvious theme, but still has the charm from the original trilogy. In my opinion, better than the first three!
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Love the 'tap-n-move' feature. Just tap the card(s) you want to move and they go to the most logical position. If there's an alternative position you prefer, tap again or drag manually. Nice uncomplicated game.
B00170MYIS|5.0|This is a spare rechargeable lithum ion battery for my Sony digital camera.  It holds it cager for a long time without having to recharge it.  I love this battery.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It was ok but did not help with homework, but it was pretty good. It was pretty cool, but I am doing accents/stress.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|The Trasformers Trilogy blue ray is an excellant movie because picure and sound quaility is second to none.  The price for the trilogy is a good buy.  I love these movies.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This was and still is a book about a great American who just recently dies doing what is right. Not enough people are trying to do what he did in helping Vets re-adjust to &#34;normal&#34; life.
B00028HBKM|5.0|the DVD was great...we showed it on a huge screen to a group...so the wide screen version was like being at the movies.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|We're sortta weird when it comes to weather in Western Pennsylvania. Are way of living here is we check the weather constantly even on a perfect day. Whether we check our daily or the place we go to we check it. This app will definitely be over used.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|It was obvious a lot of work went into this story. Everything - the script, characters, visuals, comedy timing and storyline were exceptional. A definite favorite.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I liked this  book because of all the suspense and action that takes place. Rick Riordan makes you want to know more even after this series comes to an end.
B006TJXZ30|2.0|Overall, I like Hotmail. I am not a fan of the black with white font. What is really frustrating about this version (and the one on my phone) is that it will only pull up some e-mails in different folders and they are ususally random. It hasn't been able to pull up e-mails I do searches for. In summary, though these are frustrating, I can recieve all my new messages and respond to them without issue (so far) and I do like Hotmail.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Take to work with me and helps me get through the quiet times and speeds the end of the day
B0000AM6IY|4.0|Has been modernized and restaged, but when it comes right down to it, you can't improve on perfection.  A little hokey, a little over the top, but still one of the better modern musicals on stage or screen.
B008PCVGKI|3.0|All progress is associated with various risks and this of course also applies to drug discovery and development. However, where would we be without the drugs that have been developed by the large western capitalistic researching pharmaceutical companies? As far as I know not a single useful drug has hitherto been discovered in the leftist (communistic) countries, neither the USSR nor China despite all their resources and manpower. And what about the author´s own profession? I would like that Dr Goldacre's next book would be devoted to this subject, e.g. with the title Bad Doctors. After all the doctors are responsible for diagnosis and treatment of diseases including drug prescribing.<br /><br />Reynir Eyjolfsson PhD pharm
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|Love the quality of the film.  One of my favorite movies to watch over and over again.  It's definitely one of the best musicals produced.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|I have to admit that I stayed up until 2am in the morning to finish this. After a little bit of a slow start, this book really takes off, capturing exactly what it is to be young and in love. Just reading it made me feel giddy.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Albom reminds us of our humanity while spinning a touching yarn. A great and powerful read for any age or gender.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|As a kid, I think I was led astray a bit by the phrase &#34;Fun for the whole family!&#34; Could be true, but I have little hope for a family consisting entirely of toddlers.<br />Rango is a movie that's fun for the whole family. And I say that because I mean it, not as a standard marketing phrase. There's plenty of wit in the dialog aimed at any age, really, and the performances of the characters (two of which taken straight from Pirates of the Caribbean) are very enjoyable.<br />I especially like the stylization of the animals. They're not meant to be cute in the least, even the furry ones. At the least, it makes for a stylistic break from anything you might be used to, and settles you much further in the rough, wild, and often cruel land of the West.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I half expected a Bruce Willis action movie, which definitely has its place- but this has some twists and turns, even a moral dilema! Bruce doesn't have a lot of lines, which may have helped...
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|As I have said befroe this series is wonderful, very well done and I can't get enough. It is the best television I've watched in years.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|This movie is what a horror film should be, scary and creepy. It does not rely on special effects or buckets of blood and guts; instead it plays on the deep dark fears that many of us have. The use of grainy, super 8 film to show the various murders was very effective. The tilted camera angles and faded color did more to send a chill down my spine than any computer generated effect or gory scenes of blood and guts.<br /><br />The acting is great. The filming , lighting and imagery are all done perfectly to add to a very atmospheric and creepy movie. The script isn't anything new, but the story manages to have a fresh feel because it is handled in a fresh way.<br /><br />If you like to sit in the dark and get a good scare, this is the movie for you. Just don't watch it alone.
B00571F26Y|1.0|this is just another Atkins in sheeps clothing. The diet is very restrictive and a set up for failure as craving will kill you. The feeling of deprivation and limitation makes this a tough one to follow. The authors findings about wheat and nutrition are suspect and I also doubt the results in curing so many conditions. Skip it.
B00A9X9VAI|4.0|...I had the ending figured about somewhere around the halfway mark. I even paused the movie and told the kids I was going to send them an email with the ending so they could see I was right. Sure enough, i was right on almost all points of the ending. It's not so much that the movie is predictable... I can't explain it. Overall, it's a good thriller and it was entertaining enough I figure it was worth the cost of buying it to watch. My adult children both loved the show. It is one you want to pay attention to or it can get a little confusing when they start moving back and forth through time. Other than that, it's a good suspense thriller with a lot of action.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this story and these characters. Can't get enough. It is so well done! Some quality television for a change.
B002ZBN13A|4.0|.... but when I am, this album is amazing. It's soulful and moving, with orchestration and noise and emotion all mixed into each song. I can relate to the words when I'm in the right mood, and can sway with the music when I'm not in the mood for the words. The one downside is how high-pitched her voice is. This can get a little tiring to listen to for long periods, and after a while, I find all the songs start to drone a bit and sound alike. I have to break it up with other music.
B0099114WO|5.0|This movie is so funny...especial if you are over 40 and in a long term relationship...couples of all ages will be able to relate to the starring couple.
B00448SE4S|5.0|...will likely laugh and laugh at this show. I wasn't expecting to like it. My children forced me to watch it. About 10 minutes into it, I was hooked, and I laughed through the whole stupid show. I call it a 'stupid show', 'cause that's the type of humor it means to be. There are tons of references to 80s-style video games, midi players, pizelated graphics, beating video game levels and fighting the bosses and the final boss, etc. It's fast paced, and there are a lot of quick, sarcastic jokes you have to pay attention to in order to 'get' them. I'm a 'middle-aged woman' and found the show hilarious. My kids are adults, one is 18 and the other 25, and they died laughing through the show. If you have any geeky video game nostalgia, you'll probably like the show too. Otherwise, it might not be your thing. We watched it twice...LOL and I don't usually re-watch movies.
0756407125|4.0|expands the characters more, though it still pretty narrative<br />looking forward to the final book in this trilogy, hopefully it will transition into the &#34;present&#34;
B007UXSPK2|5.0|This is the best of the franchise. It's non-stop action from start to finish. The cast all has chemistry and work great together. I'm adding this to my exclusive favorites list.
B008UG0JJI|5.0|I dug Hiromi's music when she debuted her first CD. To have Telarc be in love with you and sign you to your debut CD  is also no small feat. It seems that she is evolving with each successive CD release, and as the music evolves it maintains that signature Hiromi sound. We're are witness to a very special and talented individual that will continue to impress year after year. Thanks for the great music Hiromi, everytime we listen it make us enjoy life a little better.
B001EN71DG|1.0|This is a vote for the original theatrical release because the ones being sold now are the altered versions. Giving the impression that these are the original theatrical releases of the films in the last 70s, early 80s is a scam and great way to alienate fans.
0345525558|1.0|It was so depressing, I didn't finish it, nor did I send it as a gift. Wouldn't reccomend it to anyone.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Bought this one cause it's my most favorite christmas movie. Love the special feature section too. Great DVD.Good price to!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app. I would like to have more to play and more challenging. Highly recommend this to all.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|Can not find the down load button to load so I do not know if it works.Help on this any one.I do not hate it yet due to this is why the rating in there.
030796664X|5.0|The best book i have ever read, or listened too actually. So informative, interesting and very scientific. A must read.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|One of our favorite games.I introduced this game to my husband years ago he enjoys it a lot.Now it is on my Kindle Fire.I have to fight him for my Kindle Fire some times.Not saying that is a bad thing. ;)
B000EHSN9Y|5.0|This adapter cost more but comes with peace of mind that it will function properly. The construction feels solid and the connector fits in perfectly, not loose nor tight but with a good feel. Recommended to those who struggle with knock offs that don't deliver any signal.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|It was late, could not sleep and saw this on my Kindle Fire HD.  Love the parade scene so I thought I'd watch it.  Great way to get relaxed.
B0045EJY90|4.0|Love the quality and the price. The only reason for not rating 5 stars is for lack of Unicode support
B0095P3ULC|5.0|It is just as good as the previous Transformer movies. Like the humor, action and drama. Wish I had a Bumble-Bee protector or car!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Lots of levels. Interesting twist going in between worlds. Worked great on my Kindle Fire. Controls simple to use and puzzles and games easy to work through. Would def recommend. I did feel that $4.99 was 2.00 too much!
B009RH9HDS|4.0|Love this case.  Thick leather, the color is exactly like the picture.  One issue I have is when reading in bed, i have to hold the Kindle in one way so that it doesn't swing out.  I wish there was a way to lock the Kindle into the case.
B00A9V2JSG|3.0|The concept of treating love like a disease and the root of all society's issues intrigued me. The sample offered by Amazon drew me in further. So, I purchased the full book. That's when the narcoleptic fits started. Normally I can't put a book down but this book was putting me down... for about 2/3 of the book I found myself either falling asleep or putting the book down to get a break from the repetitive passages and overload of descriptive language. There were some intense scenes in the book but not enough to carry the whole story. I didn't hate the book but I wouldn't recommend paying full price. If you can get it for super cheap or borrow it from someone, then it's worth a read... at minimal you'll get some good rest.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I do not like how when there is too much garbage or such that it replaces the upgrade button because I went to click that button as it got dealt with and it made me buy the upgrade when I had been saving money for something else and there is no way to undo it...lost a star for that.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|to get a watch of this quality I would expect to pay several hundred if not thousand dollars, so when I saw someone wearing this watch, and picked it up, I was shocked and had to have one.  I wore the rolex Daytona for several years before having to sell it under pressure from the economy.  This is a similar watch in weight, size, and feel, if not a rolex, as nice a feel.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This book is really good! I am reading the series in order so it helps to know what is going on in the story. In the middle of the book, it kind of gets confusing. But once you understand what the words are talking about, the book is good! Lots of action scenes at the end!
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I took a chance ordering the first season of Homeland. I don't receive HBO and had never seen an episode. But noticed it won Emmys and thought it must be good. I wasn't disappointed. Now I'm hooked. I have to order the next season.
B002C949KE|5.0|It was very interesting and thought provoking.  I love learning about how the brain works, and this book was full of explanations.
B004I744AS|5.0|I found way more than I expected to find on this app. I love it and use it all the time. Thank you for making such a wonderful learning tool.
B0058W74UY|5.0|Love it it is the best I think it comes in handy when I need it so. I wont delete it
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the show, can't get enough of it. Finally Mary and Matthew get together, we see what Season 3 brings.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I would recommed this app to everyone who loved to cook.<br />I rate it the best cooking game ever.<br />I like that it has different cultures in ityou learn more about the food of other cultures ok<br />Its the best way to learn how the cultures work
B0056CUZRA|5.0|loved this book.....great story woven through historical fact.......deals with the great social change that was happening at the time<br /><br />just as good as pillars of trhe earth
B009DKCBM8|5.0|i would like that in package of the CDs there also came a spanish subtitle, or the letter in spanish.<br />thats all thanks
140123755X|5.0|What if all the characters from your beloved fairy tales lived here in our world, in New York City? Welcome to the world of Bill Willingham's award-winning Vertigo series Fables.<br /><br />The premise is simple. Centuries ago* all of the Fables were driven from their lands by The Adversary, winding up in our world. They congregated in the New World, setting up their own community among us where they have been living ever since in relative peace. As a founding principle of their community, all sins commited in the Homeland are forgiven--you start out in Fabletown with a clean slate. No one embodies this fact more than Bigby (Big Bad) Wolf, sheriff of Fabletown and the main protagonist of the series (or at least this first volume, anyway.)<br /><br />Boring as this job usually is, Bigby has his work cut out for him this time. Rose Red--sister of Deputy Mayor Snow White--has been murdered, her apartment trashed and splattered in blood, and everyone is a suspect, from her estranged sister to her ne'er-do-well boyfriend Jack (of Beanstalk and Giant-Killer fame) to Bluebeard, the richest man in Fabletown with a reputation for murdering his wives. No one can be trusted and nothing is as it seems as Bigby tries to get to the bottom of the case.<br /><br />The bonus prose story at the back of the collection, A Wolf In The Fold, was also excellent. It details the backstory of Bigby around the time of the Invasion, his first meeting with Snow and Rose, and how he came to be a mostly-accepted member of the Fables community, as well as the origin of his lycanthropy.<br /><br />Willingham has created something truly awesome here, taking characters we all know, as well as less familiar ones like Bluebeard, and putting a different spin on them. I'll avoid spoilers, for the most part here. Some memorable characters we are introduced to here include:<br />-Bigby \\"Big Bad\\" Wolf: Sheriff of Fabletown and a werewolf (or more accurately a werehuman, as a wolf is his original form.) In the Homelands he was a feared beast before the Adversary came, at which point he became a severe thorn in the enemy's side.<br />-Snow White: Deputy Mayor of Fabletown, first ex-wife of Prince Charming. King Cole, the Mayor, handles the ceremony and gladhanding; Snow handles the dirty business of keeping things running.<br />-Prince Charming: A serial womanizer and ex-husband of a number of Fable princesses. He has been spending most of his time in Europe, mooching off of the royalty there, but seems to have outstayed his welcome....<br />-Jack: Rose Red's feckless boyfriend, always up to one get-rich-quick scheme or another. Former owner of some magic beans, among other claims to fame.<br />-Bluebeard: The richest man in Fabletown. In the Homelands he had a habit of killing his wives on their wedding night. He can't be charged for this given the General Amnesty that holds the Fables community together, but everyone can't help but wonder if he has returned to old habits.<br />Other characters drop in and out, possibly becoming important in later volumes. Beauty and the Beast make an appearance, still together although when Belle gets annoyed with him Beast's curse will begin to reappear. Little Boy Blue shows up as Snow's assistant. Cinderella shows up briefly, being trained in swordplay by Bluebeard. Assorted other fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters make up the supporting cast, from goblins to one of the Three Little Pigs.<br /><br />Content: This is a series from DC's Vertigo line, intended for adults. Its firmly rated R, though maybe not so much as others from that house such as Preacher or anything written by Alan Moore.<br />Language: R. Not on the level of a Tarantino flick, but assorted uses of the \\"F-bomb.\\"<br />Violence: PG-13. Some fencing, the aftermath of a grisly murder (though no body is in evidence), and references to a character being tortured. Not too bad.<br />Sexual content: hard PG-13/mild R. We see a couple having sex, but there's no nudity.<br /><br />*It would seem that the Fables are functionally immortal, though they can be killed.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|So, if you want to watch doctors act like high school students and torment each other and fight.....this is the movie for you. It was a bit slow in the beginning but the pace picks up after a while. Even though this movie wasn't for me I watched it to the end and I was entertained so.....3 stars.  It wasn't horrible but not my thing.
B00BETX5PS|1.0|Very dissapointed would not play on Roku or Sony DVD player with 12mb cablemodem connection. I had to purchase the movie again in regular definition in order to watch it.  Didn't appreciate having to pay twice for the same movie, wish there was an easier way to play the NON HD version once you pay full price for the HD version but there is none.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Ok, yeah.....you would think these movies are getting a little old but......NOOOOOOO!!!!<br />It was a ton of fun to watch.<br />Exotic locations an inventive plot and great acting made the movie a great \\"watch\\".<br />The special effects were great and Tom Cruise was great.<br />I'm looking forward to the next one in the series.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is the BEST GAME EVER . It may be 7 dollars but it's WORTH it.<br />It has updates that gives armor and stuff . But gold is hard to find.<br />I LOVE THIS GAME.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you are looking for an excellent series, Downton Abbey is it.  Once I started season 1 I was hooked and couldn't stop until I had watched as much as I could get.  I highly recommend Downton Abbey.
B004GTOKJS|5.0|This series provides a window into the lives and times of the inhabitants of a small English market town in the mid 19th century. The surprising social morays and precision and exquisite use of language is a far cry from the familiar and pedestrian use of verbal communications of the 21st century. While watching, I was transported to the village and sometimes forgot I was watching a video. Bravo PBS for carrying such fine programming.
B0041G683W|5.0|Stunning...moving...heartbreaking and uplifting all at the same time.  Wonderfully produced and directed.  Mr Boe is simply a show stopper.  It brings tears to my eyes.
B00170I7GG|5.0|You will enjoy this comedy movie and afterwards ...you will think about life in a new way.<br />Many memorable scenes and great lines in this movie.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|This one is more difficult to do than the Angry Birds games.  It tends to frustrate my youngest grandchild.  I don't play these things so I have no comment on my end.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very entertaining , keeps you engaged. We hate when the hour show its over. .. keep it coming, love each and every character
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am not a gamer but all three of my grandkids love the game.  It has good graphics and sound effects.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|The only character that has color is the bad guy and he saved the movie. You feel sorry for Bond all along and hope someone helps him and then offers him retirement. Long are gone the days when Roger Moore saved the day with charm and without too many technical explanations - just ...Bond. Try to answer to the question - who is old and pathetic and if the answer is the main character maybe the movies should have been about a new Bond raising to the power!
1616550414|5.0|I choose that ranking because the product it's great and it arived before the planed date!! Everything it's ok!! Thanks
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Download all the great classics possible. They are usually free and can be a nice change to our current library.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|Good case, high quality.  Kindle snapped right in with a good fit.  I like the interior is non-skid, I can set the kindle at nearly any angle for horizontal viewing.  I wish that there was some non-skid on the outside.  When listening to music, it takes two hands to change the volume when the case is on a desk.  One hand to hold the Kindle, the other to press the button.  Not slippery, but not sticky either.
B001G9FFIQ|1.0|I normally do not go out of my way to write reviews, but I simply had to share my experience. My one star rating is not for the Music itself, but for the condition that the new LPs arrived in. I want to be clear in saying that the Amazon LP packaging is VERY good, and I want to praise Amazon for thier customer service, and amazing return/refund policy.<br /><br />I was excited when my brand new 2xLP Vinyl &#34;And Justice For All&#34; record arrived. I broke the seal on the shrink wrap, and closely examined the LP surfaces (just like I do for every new record I buy). To my dismay, I saw that there were a series of fine scratches and scuffs running from the label, to the outer edge of the LP, on BOTH of the LPs in this 2 LP set. Ok, no big deal, I will send it back for a replacement. A week goes by, and I receive a minty fresh copy once again. Break the shrink wrap seal, and... I see the SAME types of (very obvious) scratches that run from the label to the outer edge of the LP, on BOTH of the LPs. OK then, I will give it one more shot. I returned the record to Amazon, and they sent me a replacement, and... you guessed it, once again tons of scuffs/scratches and imperfections on the vinyl surface of both of the LPs.<br /><br />My theory is that either the LPs are somehow shifting during transit, and the cheap, sandpaper like sleeves are rubbing these scuffs into the surface of the vinyl, or Mobile Fidelity has horrendous quality control. Mobile Fidelity toots their own horn about how amazing they are at pressing reissues of LPs. so this is absolutely unacceptable in my opinion. I can't even believe that Mobile Fidelity would even put an LP in a paper sleeve to begin with - why would they not put thier LPs in thier own MoFi anti-static/anti-scratch sleeves? I am now hesitant to purchase any LPs from Mobile Fidelity going forward.<br /><br />I have never seen anything like this when buying brand new LPs. I recently ordered 5 other bran new LPs from Amazon (none of which were from Mobile Fidelity), and all of them have pristine playing surfaces that are scratch and scuff free.<br /><br />So this is just a friendly heads up for those of you who may be considering the purchase of this 2LP set from Mobile Fidelity.were from Mobile Fidelity), and all of them have pristine playing surfaces that are scratch and scuff free.<br /><br />So this is just a friendly heads up for those of you who may be considering the purchase of this 2LP set from Mobile Fidelity.
B002SS8S7E|5.0|Really enjoyed watching this on my Kindle, great movie in the new Batman Trilogy.  High quality view on the HD Kindle, great example of a fun movie on an Innovative device.
0439023521|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book!  It may be for young adults but \\"regular\\" adults can enjoy it as well.  It was the story of 16 year old Katniss, who lives in a post-apocalyptic US where a new government rules and their laws are very different from ours.  I think the point on the author was to have us take a good look at how we live since in many cases we can be no different than many of the villains in this book.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I thought Matched was one of the great books in the dystopian genre.  Then came Crossed.  I like this better than Matched!  I like seeing the story not only from Cassia's point of view, but it was nice to see inside Ky's mind too.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Very well done. Special effects were first rate. Plot line was good. Only a few glitches where I said to myself, &#34;why the hell did they do that?&#34; It's hard to pick up a story in the middle, but they did it nicely.
B0076DELIG|5.0|a detective novel that keeps you interested. I enjoyed the book, well researched , thought out story with real like characters.
B003YFIUW8|2.0|My book club just loved this book.  There were two of us that hated it.  I was one of the two.  It's been a month since I've read it and I can't say that I feel as strongly of a hate as I did.  I think I had to step back and get perspective.  I have a boy that is the same age as the character in the book and it was really hard to separate that while I was reading it.  The story is written from a child's perspective so the grammar made it hard to get in to.  It was a disturbing story.  Again, it made for a great discussion in our book club meeting.  I think it's going to be one of those you either love or hate.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I had seen the movie and wanted to read the book. The book was a little different then the movie but still very good.<br />This was a case of seeing the movie first and reading book 2nd. while reading it I could picture all the characters, that where in the movie. It made the book more fun.<br />I would tell all my reading friend's to see the movie first, then read the book.  That is completely backwards but fits this book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Absolutely loved this trilogy.  Liked the first book the best.  Reread the entire series twice.  After I finished the third book, I was disheartened at the state of the main characters.  I needed to reread the first to catch their zest for life again.  By the end of the third book, it is understandable that they are but a shell of their former selves.  Still loved it though.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Great album with amazing music and vocals and meaningful lyrics. The music world should be proud of this newly developing band.
B000FCK65W|3.0|Another depressing book picked by my book club.  I didn't hate it.  I didn't love it.  It gave a really moving story of what it was to be poor in this country in its early years.  Really made you think how much we have now.  Also, gave you much insight on the struggles that immigrants had when they first came to the land of opportunity.  It was not a face paced book.  Took me awhile to get through it.  I finished it so that says that I liked it somewhat.  It made for an interesting book club discussion.  However, it was just too slow for me.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|I'm enjoying Season 2 very much. The story is intricate and I think better than 3. I had a problem with video quality but that may be a function of my connection speed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this game.  More challenging than the first.  Cool graphics.  More challenging sequences than the first.  We try to get to the mine.  Like that you can restart the game with a gem.  Very happy with it.
B0018RC7QE|5.0|Describes the awkwardness and honesty of the power of love. Something we should never forget.<br />It demonstrates the difference between the casualness of lust and the incredible draw of love.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved this book so much...it's one of the best books I have read for a very very long time.. :-p
B00AREIAI8|4.0|good game. great graphics. can get a bit choppy but overall a fun game. would definitely recommend it to others.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It was very difficult to stop reading each night and go to sleep; like turning off a good movie at the best part (the whole book was the best part).  I was fascinated right up to the very last page.  No boring scenery descriptions or rambling/unimportant dialog.  The ending was very abrupt and I was disappointed only because I didn't want the story to be over and I wanted to find out what happened next.  The book was fantastic.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It's your basic spider solitaire game. If you like spider then you should get this app!! Fun without too much thought
B000QCS8TW|5.0|LOVE this series (this is my second time through) from beginning to, well, NEAR the end.  A large and various cast of characters, all of whom are fascinating and memorable, a great and interwoven story, surprising and shocking turns...what's not to love? Not for the lover of the short novel, but a prize for those who hate to see a story end.
B000002JEV|5.0|Any true fans of Zeppelin will like this one.  The songs are some of their best and the sound is decent on it too.......I love it, but then, I love them.......
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love this game.  Once you start playing you can't stop because you always want to get a higher score and run farther!
B008KO8KZ0|5.0|we laugh the whole time while we morph our pictures<br />we even did the dog and mon and dad lol
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am addicted to solitaire so this game is perfect to me!  I can't stop playing it!  Time just flies by playing this game!
0823003590|5.0|a definite must have for any artists library collection, glad I purchased this book. Provides great information of the anatomy and of course comes with step by step images for proper visualization.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I usually prefer death and destruction but this is a close second.They're real characters in real situations (given that it's the near future) and well written to boot! just enough flashes of brillance and nail-biting to make it a very good read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator. Fits in whole screen. Easy to use. Has basic math uses.  Easy fast download. Must have
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Nothing can be taken for granted in this show since even the lead characters can die or be eaten. At the end of each episode I am always left wanting more. A truly great series.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|There is no better entertainment that can be had than that made in England.  I am now on Season 2 of this series and love every minute of it!  Pure entertainment and not the constant physical conflicts of American films.  Give me more like this!
1476712042|1.0|If I could give this book a score of 0, I would. I have no idea why it is rated so highly. To me the writing is terrible; the characters are unlikable and silly; the plot is disturbing, but somehow also boring. I gave up on actually reading it halfway through because I found the writing style (bizarre use of first person) too irritating. I am seriously rethinking my reliance on Amazon reviews and ratings for buying books. I know some people loved it, but it was just not for me at all.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The best game ever but once you find diamonds and Don`t use the right pickaxe it's gone never going to find it again in less you get lucky but the DIAMONDS you do find there are a lot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|This is a very exciting series to watch.  It's full of drama, suspense, a little &#34;Out There&#34; stuff, but always enjoyable to watch.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Pro: several levels to challenge player<br />Con:  addictive<br /><br />Entertaining and challenging.  Finding it difficult to put down after completing each level.
B00BEL4P9Q|5.0|First Sybil now Matthew!  I mean really......He survived the war, not being able to walk, the death of his fiance' and finally helped to save Downton Abbey as well as finally marrying the woman of his dreams and have her love him back and have a son & heir. I hope they find a way to salvage this, please. I do love this show.
B002RVCD0U|4.0|Lot of action - continuing from the previous movie. A little dark throughout the movie, but indicative of the war on earth.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked this book very much. It is the final book in the Hunger Games trilogy. It had some powerful moments, and although I was vascillating on the writing quality for a while, in the end, I thought it was well written. For me, it is a dark book, delving as it does into the wrecked minds and lives of the victors in the games. Of course, all the books deal with the horrors visited on the population by the Capitol, but it comes out in a different way in this last volume. It has exciting moments, and you won't lose interest. Beware the dark side. But life finds a way, and that is the note on which this book ends.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Of a much-beloved series. Crazy-complicated story line, but so well executed I was happy to just strap myself in and go along for the nonstop thrill ride. The casting and characterizations of the original cast are near-perfect; my only quibble is with Scotty,one of my favorite characters in the original series. He has lost his quiet, stoic sweetness in his new incarnation as comic relief. But Kirk, Spock, and Bones are so spot-on that I'm willing to overlook it. Can't wait for the next one.
B006LA6IW2|5.0|WOW! Chris Kyle is the epitome of GUNG HO.  Thank God for him and others like him.  There were huge amounts of combat and this is a glimpse into the mind of a SEAL at the tip of the spear.  One man can make a difference and Chris Kyle made an impact on me, thousands of American Marines and Soldiers and Sailors and a huge impact on hundreds of dead terrorists. It's exciting, funny, sad, and enlightening.  It left me wanting more.  My only disappointment is with Amazon or Kindle.  I bought the (Enhanced Edition).<br />There were still photos that displayed on my Kindle.  There were videos that would not play on &#34;my equipment&#34;.  They would not play on my PC with a Kindle reader either.  That is why I bought the Enhanced Edition.  What does it take to see the video?<br />Jim Cauthen
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It was really entertainning even though you could guess how it was going to end.  It was a great cast.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I love this mic! I do a lot of interview work with a dslr, and I hate having to do separate sound. With this mic I can just plug it right into the dslr and get excellent quality sound for such a cheap price! Always a great thing for anyone to have in their camera bag.
B0010OIN90|4.0|Neat little watch and kid seem to enjoy it. It did come apart and was a little hard for him to keep together but with a little adjusting, it seems to be working out fine.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Great product. Super easy to download. Loved this episode.  Love the ease to download movies from Amazon.  Forget red box
B000QCS8TW|4.0|This is an excellent read in a genre similar to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series -- a huge cast of characters to keep track of set in a wholly imagined world.  The biggest difference, which I was not expecting, is that Game of Thrones was quite a simple read.  It moves quickly between events without overloading you with description and superfluous narrative.  Each chapter comes from the perspective of a different character, which is interesting and helps blur the lines between good and evil characters as readers learn the motivations and concerns of the main cast.  I like the realism of that blurred line; the world is never quite as simple as we try to make it, and Game of Thrones takes that to heart.  I am not impressed overall with George Martin's use of his female characters, but fortunately there was some improvement as the book continued, which gives me hope for the rest of the series.
B005T87QCI|5.0|My eight year old grandson really loves this game and loves showing me the different fighters and their abilities. For the 8-15 year old range it's a great pasttime.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I very much enjoy Downton Abbey.  I am one of the late comers and only started watching it a couple of weeks ago.  I started at Season 1 on Netflix but then moved to Amazon Prime for Season 2.  Now I'm on PBS.org for Season 3.  I won't watch the season finale until I get caught up with it.<br /><br />Love it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|if they would just lower the price...id totally buy it. oher wise its awesome. but the XBOX version is soooooo much better. get the XBOX version ensted. cool cool cool cool cool cool. go go go go go go go go now now now now now.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This novel was impressive to me for the way in which it brought the life and times of Ireland to life through these characters. It was heartending to read the flashbacks of the one of the characters' early life experiences, but also helped to teach me something I had not known about, until now.<br />Possibly the twist at the end was too coincidental - or maybe not? But it was totally unexpected to me, and I was so taken with the characters and setting, and their lives, that I thought about this book for long afterward.<br />A great read!
B00821OX98|5.0|Having never seen one episode of Falling Skies....I was floored by how good and well done this TV series was.<br />It gripped us to the point of watching the entire series in like 2 days!
B008X8QCTO|5.0|This game surprised me, not because of the cost, but because of how intricate it was. The story and background scenery was great. I was prepared to pay.  You can't expect something for nothing. I can't even rent a old B movie for this price.  Very affordable entertainment, really.<br /><br />When I first started this game, I thought, \\"Uh, oh\\" because it seemed pretty simplistic.  The ho games seemed juvenile.  But as it progressed I was very pleasantly surprised.  Just when I thought the game was ending, a whole new aspect would open up.  This happened more than once, too. Plus the hogs  improved. Zoom, hints and skip if you need them. The puzzles were fun and mildly challenging. Just right! I also didn't need to print up a walk-thru in order to make some forward progress. (The extra bonus chapter was good too! I think it alone was worth 99¢)<br /><br />I play alot of the adventure games, and usually lean more toward the realistic, serious problem solving types. But to be honest, most of them have been using that paranormal format to well....death.  I'm about zombie/ghost/ghoulied out. True, this had its share of creepy, but it was so outlandish that I could hardly wait for what came next. This game turned out to be loads of FUN.  Just what entertainment is supposed to be.  And would be well worth an even higher price.<br /><br />And my Fire HD had no troubles. The download wasn't too long, but I did it via cable tv/wifi. Your only as fast as the equipment you use. Some people seem as if they want a PS2 or X-Box type of experience, but with a free or 99¢ price tag.  Even with the extra charge, it's worth it. And G5 changed this purchase so there are no more surprises.  Cut them some slack. It is, after all a business.  AND.... This is a great game!
B0031Q0XCA|4.0|Cute movie, a little bit annoying trying to keep track of the different time periods, but once you give that up and just enjoy the movie it's pretty nice.
B00B2Q9NM2|5.0|Great movie, great cast and great fighting scenes!!! Watched it three times already and still stay glued!! Hope they make a second part!!
B00174TKGI|4.0|A very good movie that is unfortunately a little too long. I'm sure that it would keep me 100% engaged in a theater, but at home I zoned out several times.
020530902X|5.0|The best book of its kind regardless of length.  I recommend it to everyone who comes to work with me to help them write scientific papers accurately and fluently without excessive verbiage.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|I was kind of scratching my head the first few minutes into the movie asking myself if I made the mistake of buying it since it starts off with a nude scene and lots of swearing... I was worried it would not have much story content.<br /><br />But it turned out to be a typical drama type movie, but with a nice twist and action sequence.
B00B8PMWJI|2.0|With exception of A is for Apocalypse, you see all the other good deaths in the preview. Most of the others are so Corney and stupid you just sit there wondering why the heck you are watching this. My advice, if you want to see this wait for the dvd release. It will be in walmarts $5 bin within weeks of release.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|The story and the scenery with using those classic cars from the 70's and 80's was a very nice touch.<br /><br />I am glad Ben Affleck is back in business with this movie.  :)
B003H8WSLQ|5.0|This album is one of the intresting bands of this generations,Their genere is new wave, with some math rock, more likely. All songs are quite deep base on the &#34;Total Life Forever&#34; concept ,kind of athing.Some of the songs descripts as a melanchoical , unsustified, and betrayel.However, all the songs had depest sounds as a sci-fi-experimentation. and the melody's are well develop. Even for the best critic-musician can agree in musical richness. Coolest song are Miami,Spanish Sahara, Total Life Forever.
B00973902K|5.0|If I hear this song one more time, my head might explode.  But it's a cute little song, and I love listening to my kids sing it.
B0054LVP3Q|5.0|Good story line which kept me guessing. A very engrossing read. I would recommend this book if you like suspense.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I'm a 42 year old housewife and I can't get enough of this show.  Campy and dramatic, but fun and suspenseful.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|What's lost in business today is simplicity.  This book removes the business clutter and gives you very good insight into keeping it simple.
0380018179|5.0|I loved this book.  Was a bit hesitant to read &#34;another love story&#34; when I started it, but it is so much more than that.  Memorable characters, great setting, beautiful writing.  Highly recommend.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|This movie tried to do too much.  It tried to tell too much of the story (with Tolstoy you kind of need to pick and choose) and it tried too hard to be artistic.  If you have seen Dogville, you know what they were trying to accomplish with the minimalist set at times, but it was nowhere near as effective.<br /><br />The plot also jumped around quite a bit without any explanation.  I imagine that the unedited version of the film could be quite good, but is also probably about 8 hours long.  This version is definitely for someone who has either read the novel or has seen the Vivien Leigh film version, but I can't imagine being able to follow anything if you have done neither.  I spent most of the film explaining to my friend what was happening and what had happened (in the book) from one scene to the next so that it would make more sense to him.<br /><br />I only gave it two stars.  It felt like there were too many hands in the pot trying to make it something different all at once.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV.  Intelligent writing, brilliant acting.  Definitely worth watching...can't wait for season 6!
B00992CF6W|3.0|this kind of hurts my head so their lucky that I gave it 3stars but I do like it and this is niall horan
B00821PCJS|4.0|It said a 2 hour season premiere but actually it's only 47 minutes long . That must mean it had over an hour of commercials ? Anyways , good story plot and plenty of action to follow and keep me interested in what was to happen to next . As I think I read what other reviewers mentioned , it would have been great to see the aliens arrive and take control instead of after the fact . I've watched this one plus the season 2 beginning . I have never watched any series on tv as I am a movie person .
B00007E7K0|5.0|I was a bit skeptical about how this replacement cover would be compared to the original (which I lost at a party). I was glad to see it is exactly like the original. Fits perfectly, looks authentic Canon (even though the packaging it came in did not look like it was packed by Canon).<br /><br />But on the whole, does the job and works great and reasonably priced. So 5 stars!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|ONE OF THEE BEST ZOMBIE, POST APOLCALICTED SHOW'S EVER !!!!<br />CAST IS GREAT!!<br />DIRECTOR IS GREAT !!!<br />WRITERS EXCELLENT !!!<br /><br />NOT TO MENTION LIL'ASSKICKER !!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have read ;many books about NDE and out of body but this is the best.  I always could find a reason for the mind itself to have these experiences, This makes me think we do have a consciousness not explained by science,
B007IXWKUK|2.0|was hoping that this book was better than the 1st.  maybe e.l. needs to add a lil more content and not just stick to the tacky stuff, we get the picture.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am shocked at  how much I enjoyed all three of these books. The writing is done so well that all I wanted to do was READ. I was sad the books ended.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|this is not the book for anyone who is interested in expanding their minds through reading.  hopefully the next one is better.
B008ER9QLK|5.0|This is The Ring cycle staged in a fresh bold way! I saw this Metropolitan Opera production first on PBS last year, and loved it, but knew I had to have it on blu-ray! I was glued to my seat watching it.  It's beautifully staged, the Met orchestra is amazing, and the cast superb!  Kudos to Bryn Terfel and Deborah Voigt and to our own Texan Jay Hunter Morris as Siegfried.  I have shared the collection with a friend new to opera and she has caught the bug. Thanks to Mars as well, they put the collection into my hands so quickly.  I'd definitely order from them again.
B003QSJVV2|5.0|I love the action in this movie, as well as the emotional aspect of it! I've watched this movie millions of times! Super!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a very good app. I have it on a Kindle Fire, and its working great so far! At first, its hard to build up your town to get more villagers, but I like how its challenging. You purchase animals to provide food for the townspeople and you build shops to earn cash. The town just keeps on building! You pass levels and earn cash by creating certain things or doing special missions. It teaches you about life back when America was just beginning! I like going fishing and when I get new townsfolk. Even though I wish it was a little more interactive- its basically just tapping- I like this game very much and I'll continue playing!
B008CP93S0|4.0|Paul Rudd is always amazing, as well as jennifer aniston! The movie was pretty funny.. not the best but definitely not the worst.
B009UMTMKS|5.0|Well structured, easy to read, basic and sound advice. It tells it like it is and it is good to keep handy just as a reminder to stay flexible.
B003SI9WYG|5.0|This movie is a Great for halloween, great for christmas. It used to scare me when I was younger, but I absolutely love it now!
B0013TTLDE|3.0|A complex story with a good level of detail.  A surprise and emotional ending.  Characters well developed so that you felt like you knew them and experienced their lives with them.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Not as interesting as people made it. Just a whole bunch of interviews and short stories. No main character to follow or climactic points.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Its captivating good television with out violence, or sex.  I love the clothes, hair and overall decorum the staff and family share.
B0042UGMYW|5.0|In this movie, cutie pie Zac Efron loses his brother. He has a very hard time moving on after his death. And rightfully so, Charlie made promises that were kinda hard to keep. Anyway, the story is about him dealing with the loss of his brother and how he finally gets to move on. It makes you tear up toward the end, but it is a great lesson in how to handle death and how to get on with your life. It is ok for younger teenage daughters - no cussing, no sex, no violence. It was very well made and recommended for ages 12+. Zac not bad to look at either :)
B0055G9L9U|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, very funny. I have been telling everyone about it. It uses a lot of cursing and adult humor so not good for kids.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|A must read even if you're not that interested in zombies. Very well written and thought out. A must read!
B00512S7U2|5.0|This Version Is The Only Complete Version on Page One Of Amazon's Kindle Master Key System options.<br />I did not search through the other options on following pages.<br />It contains the introduction, the foreward, the Q&A after each chapter, and links to take you to each section.<br />There are versions with some, or all of these aspects missing.<br />There is one version that is not even the Master Key System, but a different Haanel book.<br />There are also versions that have been modified.<br />Just a caution to other seekers.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|John Grisham is the man when it comes to this kind of story. the plot moved along at a good rate and the characters were well developed. I was pleasantly surprised with his choice of protagonist.
1451627297|5.0|It's been years since I've read much Stephen King (loved his books from the 1970's).  Recently, read this and two others (Duma Key & Under the Dome) and really enjoyed them - it's like reconnecting with an old friend.  Obviously, these are not high-end literature, but King spins a good yarn in a colorful, easy-to-read way.  And speaking of easy to read, love that this edition is the larger size paperback (it's not &#34;large print&#34; but it's also not the tiny print in mass market paperbacks - this is so much easier on aging eyes).  Would recommend to his old fans from back in the day.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I would recommend this book as a quick and easy read. It has a special twist that stole me heart. I love romance and love stories but this one was a little more special than I gave it credit for. I read the book and then watched the movie... I liked both but felt each were their own stories. So, see both!
0525478817|2.0|I had high hopes for this book, based on all the reviews, but for some reason I never really got emotionally attached to the characters.  They didn't seem real to me for some reason.  So, all the sad parts were sad, but not tear worthy!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I did not enjoy this book in any way. It was torture to read and impossible to believe. I had a few moments where I got sucked in but only because I couldnt believe that someone would fall for the story line. I will not read the 20 other books that follow as I did not enjoy this one. I have heard a lot of people like it so please do not disregard this book if it does interest you. I just have other books that I enjoyed way more.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I got this mp3 for only $1.99 so I was very happy. I love how catchy the songs are. Perfect for just relaxing.
0142407542|3.0|The Gruffalo is one of our son's favorite books.  He requests it often and sometimes even insists on sleeping with it.  I ordered this book hoping it would be as good as the first and, well, it just isn't.  Our son isn't as interested and in all honesty, neither am I.  The story just isn't as good.  But, if you have a Gruffalo fan in your house, it's worth a shot.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A great 3rd book. Keeps you wondering what is coming next after all that came before! Enjoyed hearing the final words.
B0097BY3K6|3.0|a good cd;;;but not great;;;;;though i am glad i did get it;;;;he is an amazing musician;;;one of the best i have heard
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I think you should play it. I think it is so so so so so so great $$$$!!!!!########!!!!!!!!!!!! Play it now!!##!!!!!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|The Pact is another sad story that pulls at your heart.  The reader will enjoy the suspense as Piccoult again keeps you waiting for the end of the story.
B00486070K|4.0|This adapter works as expected (simply plug it in and it works). The only caveat is it runs a bit slower on my MacBook Air than the built-in ethernet on my MacBook Pro.
B00846REIS|4.0|It was very good I thought it was a little too much like fifty shades but that might change with the second book
B002SAS26E|4.0|While this two player trading game seems simple on the surface, it really is complex. The first few times you play, the game may seem like it is mainly based on luck, but once you get into it, you will discover all the nuances and strategies that make this a fun, fast-paced game.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is fun. But some people might cant get some of the  missions cuz they don't kno how.it should have different boards or rather different places to ho instead of the train tracks(boring) but all together it is fun.
B0096A9QXC|5.0|It's a game for kids or adults! I love the simplicity, the sound effects, yet it challenges my mind and concentration! I just wish there were more levels to open to.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My 14 year old daughter and 3 year old son will sit down and play this game for 45 minutes each!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was real page turner. One of his best books by far! People think sparks is overrated but I thought this was different from his other books, I would recommend it to anyone.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Denzel does a very good job portraying an alcoholic airline pilot. He saves the plane and ultimately himself after watching his own life fall apart.  Not a good showing for  the airline industry.
B00130UFY2|3.0|Solid installment in series. Not great art but good action..If you liked the other Bourne movies this will not disappoint.
B000IAZ5HK|5.0|So many salad dressing shakers try to do too much. They are covered in measurements, or recipes, or have fragile plastic mechanisms for mixing the dressing, or lids that are impossible to remove when oily. Or they leak. All of that stuff just complicates what should be simple. This shaker gets it right, and looks great on the table.<br /><br />The shaker comes in three pieces: the bottle, the central stopper/spout, and the top cap. To fill, remove the stopper. To mix, replace the stopper and cap and shake. To pour, remove the top cap and pour through the spout. The spout even has a double rim to catch drips. If you have a chunkier dressing that won't fit through the spout, pull out the stopper and pour directly from the bottle. Since the cap is flat on top, you can turn the stopper over on its cap and set it down without getting anything oily.<br /><br />I clean mine by putting in hot water and soap and shaking it. Rinse the parts with hot water and you're done.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Great potential but poor execution.  The plot seems to stall then dissipates. Good action however this film leaves you hanging. This might make a series if developed further.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Expiration July 2017.  A really good bargain.  I am very pleased with my purchase.  I am glad that I took the chance.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|This is the first Angry Birds I've paid for, and it was not worth it.  If you need a space-themed version, I would recommend Angry Birds Space.  It's a lot more fun, better levels, and you can get it for $.99 vs. $2.99 or whatever the Star Wars version was.  The birds in the Star Wars version are difficult to control and just plain dumb (I'm not a Star Wars fan to begin with, but I was willing to put my dislike aside for the purpose of Angry Birds). Way to put out another disappointing product so you can make a buck, George Lucas.
B00005OWIU|5.0|Well.....we all know this is good.
B0040I09RM|5.0|First season was awesome! Could not stop watching it and spent many late nights watching episode after episode. Highly recommend SOA
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Argo is worth  the rental, this Oscar winning film packs tension, suspense and a greats story into less than two hours.
1449410243|5.0|The book contains some of the funniest stuff I have ever seen from the Oatmeal. My entire family enjoyed reading this book, and while some of the stuff in it can be found on The Oatmeal's website, there was plenty of fresh material to laugh at.<br /><br />Buy this book if you are looking for a new humorous way to look at your cat.
B00BETX5PS|2.0|I rented this movie but it was so terrible I never finished watching it. The story line skipped around so much it was hard to keep up with at times. I love the old Bond movies but this one doesn't compare.
B0006LZPLC|5.0|Built to fit the shape of your feet these are the most comfortable sandals I own. Good value for good quality footwear
B005G5PPGS|5.0|This was a great book. It was very entertaining and Michael Lewis does a great job yet again. No need to be a sports fan - This book is for everyone to enjoy.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|I mean, this is quite possibly the best comic I have ever read. To this day, nothing has matched it's epicness.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Perhaps I have simply reached some sort of a personal limit on Pendergast-style stories because \\"Two Graves\\" simply did not satisfy me the way previous adventures did. All the familiar elements are present, but this time around they seemed so predictable. In truth, though, the issue here is not so much Douglas Preston's writing as my demanding attitude. I just expected too much from \\"Two Graves.\\" My judgement is that for most appreciators of the FBI agent this book will be a worthwhile investment of time.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|This was delivered on the right date stated it came in excellent condition. Having viewed the dvd already I have no complaints on the quality of the product.I'll add it to my library and will probably purchase more in the future.thankyou
B00BESM14U|5.0|What a good movie.  Emma Watson was wonderful as were the other cast members.  This isn't for family night, but is well worth the watch.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love this game , my kids are always wanting to play they keep fighting over who,s turn it is to play.  You don,t have to purchase any thing if you don,t want.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|It's a good show.<br />Amazon makes it easy to have entire seasons without all the dvd packs to lug around every time you move.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It is cool it has action what more do you want I love it without the app I do not know where we would be
B0074JODEY|5.0|if you like samurai mayhem.get it.this is a classic.even the extra with samuel l jackson stuff is very cool.i would like to see quentin tarantino redo this,or was that kill bill

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this addictive game my kids.turned me onto. Our favorite thing.is to have total wars. Love love Really wish there. Were more.games like this one.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I actually got this app before I bought my Kindle, but it's even better with both! I can leave the Kindle at home, and read my book on the go right on my phone. It syncs up nicely, so I can pick right up where I left off!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I bought this because of a $1.00 special and didn't expect too much from it.  I was totally taken away by the excellent writing and sad/tender story of a man who thought he would never be loved.  I have recommended it to my book club members.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|Another great Wes Anderson movie.  I love the way his movies are filmed and the sarcasm of his characters.  Makes me feel like a kid when I watch them.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Major question: why did this perfectly crafted, intelligently written and acted, touching little film not get nominated for an Oscar? It has all the ingredients of one of the finest films of the year - script based on the writer's own novel by the same name and directed by him, too - Stephen Chbosky - and a superb cast of young actors (and some excellent veteran actors such as Joan Cusack and Dylan McDermot and Paul Rudd, all playing against the slot roles into which others have stuck them), and makes many points about teenage angst and how the schism between teenagers and adults has become a chasm rarely navigable. But, as in current terminology, `go figure!'<br /><br />Very briefly, the story set in the early 1990s in Pittsburgh is about 15-year-old Charlie (20 year old Logan Lerman), an endearing and naïve outsider, coping with first love, the suicide of his best friend, and his own mental illness while struggling to find a group of people with whom he belongs. The introvert freshman is taken under the wings of two seniors, Sam (22 year old Emma Watson) and Patrick (19 year old Ezra Miller), who are step-siblings and welcome him to the real world. Into this m&eacute;nage enter Brad (Johnny Simmons), the football hero who happens to be a deeply closeted gay boy in an affair with the openly gay Patrick, Charlie's sister Candace (Nina Dobrey) and her abusive boyfriend Ponytale Derek (Nicholas Braun), Charlie's parents (Dylan McDermott and Kate Walsh), the influential English teach Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd) and the psychiatrist Dr. Burton (Joan Cusack).<br /><br />The story is complex as Charlie writes to his `friend' and slowly reveals the secrets of his background that make him a loner `who finds loneliness unbearable, a friend who feels his friends deserve better than they get but cannot bring himself to feel that he does too. He can rise fiercely to the occasion when his friends are threatened but is as fragile as glass when the secrets he carries buried deep inside threaten to overwhelm him.' The manner in which each of the characters change in the course of this story manages to be at once credible as well as entertaining. This is a deeply touching film that deserves a very wide audience. One of the finest films of 2012.  Grady Harp, February 13reaten to overwhelm him.' The manner in which each of the characters change in the course of this story manages to be at once credible as well as entertaining. This is a deeply touching film that deserves a very wide audience. One of the finest films of 2012.  Grady Harp, February 13
B008M7JODC|5.0|This show is beyond creepy but its one of the best shows that I have seen yet. Walter and company are so much fun to watch. Cannot wait to watch the other seasons.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Where does one start with Downton Abbey? It's wholesome, humorous, dramatic and just entertaining. Just love this show and Season 2 was the reason I upgraded to Amazon Prime.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great movie keeps moving i liked how the beginning set up the movie and  the rest is history. Bike 300 miles to the border in the winter in Iran??? gimme a break lol. this was all they had in mind at the time besides special ops.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|We really enjoyed Skyfall--lots of what you'd expect in a James Bond movie, but not as campy as the older films.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a great show.  I can't believe I waited this long to watch it.  Definitely start with seasons 1 and 2.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Game is great, but seems to lock up or not turn when playing on kindle. Not sure if this is game issue or kindle issue, but reboot fixes the problem. Game is intensively addictive.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This entire series kept me coming back for more.  Love the descriptiveness of Mr. Martin's  writing while he still manages to allow my imagination to wonder at the same time.  Several stories going on at the same time keeps you interested and when he switches from one to the other it makes you hungry for more.  AM anxious to watch the mini-series just to see how they attempt to put it on film.  Thankx Mr. Martin.
B006X5L6VS|3.0|Difficult for me to orient properly, stays fixed on one compass point even when I move it around. Nice graphics though.
B007Y612KA|2.0|Take a modern audience used to thrills and action and bore them to death with a 1950's style movie, to add insult to injury the science behind this was pure fantasy with no connection to reality.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|This is a series that was recommended to me and initially I was not too impressed. The subject matter is just quite a ways out there. What pushes it into the &#34;like&#34; category for me is the very good acting and character development. Without those I doubt that I would have kept watching the series. This is one of those series that grows on you.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I love the Harry Potter movies and have purchased all of them.  Avoid this product due to the digital copy with Flixster.  No way to get this into iTunes and very difficult to get over to iPad.  2/3 of the time I can't even access my account because of the deal they have with ultra-violet and how the login process works.  Because of how awful Flixster is I am going to have to repurchase the movie throug iTunes so that I can get a digital version.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The attention to detail and accuracy of this production, the massive cast of wonderful actors, and the artful character development make this a must see.
B0055D3EFU|5.0|I had to keep looking behind me every few minutes to make sure no one was there, I was so scared. If you are a fan of the horror genre, this is a must watch! Tops the paranormal activity series by far!!! :)
B0095P31L6|4.0|Great fun- definitely not aimed at kids though- There a lots of the winks towards other movies, and the target audience seems to be 420 friendly grown ups...
B000001ESJ|5.0|Bought this for my husband, who like me, grew up with this group. He is the bigger fan of us both, so bought this for him, as he loves to play in his vehicle to/from work
B00B3EVNEE|5.0|He is still rocking it after all these years.<br />Great piece of work and long over due.<br />Cant wait for the next one and I sure hope he swings by my neck of the woods . I missed him last time he was near.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|It was great that Amazon Prime offered this movie with no additional charges.  It is a cross between Indana Jones and Sherlock Holmes, and it feels so life-like!  It is easy to forget that it is animated.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Movie was ok but watching it at home was very irritating. The sound level between dialogue and music was way off. I constantly had to adjust volume.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I wish they had filmed more than one season. It is more entertaining than most of the stuff that is still on TV.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Easy to use.  Dims.  Good volume control.  Haven't had any issues with stopping  Doesn't seem to use too much battery power.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Great season, the show is really written well this year. The acting has been terrific and the stories well thought out.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a must see series...a PBS spectacular!  If you haven't watched, catch up before Season 4 starts! It will be worth it.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a very interesting autobiography by a very interesting person who, sadly, is no longer with us.  The book is written in a conversational tone, and while you are reading it you feel like Chris Kyle is telling you his story in person.  It offers insight into what it takes to be a Navy SEAL and what their lives are like, both on and off the battlefield.  I recommend it to anyone interested in current military affairs.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|THis book is not one of his best.  It has a great twist to the story line though.  Great read
B0053O89WY|5.0|I never hear about this show until just recently and watched a few episode from season 1 and before i knew it i was up to the 5th season and in love with this show<br /><br />The 5th season is just as good if not better than the previous 4 seasons of this show!
B004UID2LC|5.0|Its great and i didnt get any virus or whatever its fun to get free movies and music from youtube. i suggest this.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|very addictive! I love and care for every character in this tv series (even the mean & nasty ones). Cant wait till season 4
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Die hard fans of the graphic novels/comics may have issues with the differences between the two different media, but I like to think that this is what Kirkman would have wanted to show, and built into The Walking Dead U-verse, if he could have found a way to extend the graphic novels.  I like the differences because even though I've read ahead, it still keeps me guessing, and I want to know &#34;How are they going to do that?&#34;  I am really excited to see how season 3 plays out, knowing how the novel left it.  Who is going to die and how?  Keep in mind that out of the characters on there now, SO MANY of them didn't make it out of the prison alive.
B0077EBWVI|2.0|This movie commits the worst crime: making footloose boring and unoriginal. Instead of re-imagining the movie we get the exact same one with poor covers of the songs. Why not just watch the original?
B004JC16LC|5.0|This series of collected works is entirely complete, but you've got to really want to hear this music, or it might be worth it, financially. I bought it as a Christmas gist for my son, a Clarinetist obtaining a Master's Degree in Music Performance. But he was quite uninterested, much to my fatherly disappointment. But Amazon cheerfully allowed me to exchange it for another gift he really wanted.
B003NTSBUG|5.0|I rented this for my nursing class to watch. Best mental health movie I have seen in a long time!

0385536828|5.0|Serena Frome is an intellectual sort. A true lover of contemporary fiction as well as the classics, yet when she attends Cambridge she studies math at the insistence of her mother. This is a fail in many ways as it's definitely not her subject and because of it, she seems to find herself drawn to writer types which is how she ends up in an affair with a veteran of the British spy agency, MI5. Tony Canning is older and a skilled lover, which is an improvement over her orgasmically challenged ex-lover.<br /><br />The days and nights spent with Tony are blissful as well as stimulating, but when he breaks it off abruptly, she chooses to focus on her career and ends up working for the MI5 as an entry-level spy assigned to a project called Sweet Tooth. The project involves secretly funding left-wing anticommunist writers and the first writer that she is assigned to work with, is Tom Haley. Haley, known primarily for his short stories is working on a novel. Serena, quite taken with his work agrees to meet with him and shortly thereafter, the two become lovers.<br /><br />At first, Serena doesn't see the harm in the relationship. They enjoy each other's company and the weekends she spends with him mean quite a bit to her, but she doesn't see it as a permanent thing. However, as he begins to work on his novel, she finds herself more involved with the writing itself and in turn, begins to see a side to Tom that she has not seen before, that of a permanent figure within her life and this of course causes her great stress because if he were to find out that she actually worked for MI5 and has been secretly funding his project, there's no telling how he'd take the news.<br /><br />I adored this book. It's a romance for sure, but McEwan's handling of these characters makes it so much more sophisticated than a traditional romance and then there is the added detail of espionage and the secrets that Serena must keep from Tom. The tension runs high for much of the book and I found myself flipping the pages eagerly to find out the outcome. But what I did not expect, was such a surprising, well-orchestrated ending! I can't say that it took me totally by surprise, but the way in which it was written sure did. Once I saw where McEwan was going with the ending, I put the book down and saved it for when I could read the ending straight through, uninterrupted. It's THAT kind of ending. You have to read it straight through to feel the impact of it.<br /><br />If I were to compare this one to his other books, I'd say it was very similar in feel to On Chesil Beach. It's a very intimate look at a couple in love and all of their imperfections and insecurities are laid out for the reader. I really enjoyed it and now want to buy a hard copy to add to my McEwan collection. Readers who like to read about the writing process will also enjoy this book because there is a lot of writing and re-working of the novel that Tom is working on.self flipping the pages eagerly to find out the outcome.

B00B935SUY|5.0|This movie really brought back memories for my husband and me.  Not only was it cool to see how many of the really greatest greats recorded there and to hear the inside stories, but it got us reminiscing about our own days in a band together.  I would think I'd died and gone to heaven to record on that Neve board.  Fabulous soundtrack (superbly mixed, of course!)  Music fans, musicians, Foo and Dave Grohl devotees will all love this work!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I continue to be impressed by how real the surroundings, decor, and costumes seem.  I love the story lines too.
B008Q0D9DG|1.0|Trite and Stupid. One would have to be awfully bored and/or drunk to find any humor or entertainment in this.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|An inspiring book  to keep going<br /> back to. I was never bored with wondering if he'll ever find hid personal legend:-)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Often by the third season of any series I can find myself becoming bored ether with a single character or a plot thread. Sometimes, by the third season characters have moved on or been killed off and the show just isn’t the same without them. I haven’t found that to be the case with season three of Downton Abbey. In fact, I’ve enjoyed the changes and been intrigued by the way all plot threads are woven seamlessly together. The ups and downs for the overall show and the individual characters are unpredictable enough to keep you watching. Yet, at the same time, the characters and plots are just predictable enough to feel make them feel genuine.  Unless you have lived through the 1910s and 1920s we only have our books, movies and mini-series to rely on to provide us with the style and flavor of what life was like then. Some shows do it more entertainingly than others. Downton Abbey does, good entertainment, very well!
0764141201|5.0|A perfect way to learn the phrasal verbs. I am very happy with the product. It is clear and easy to use and to read.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|We love this movie, especially my 3 and 5 year old kids. The colors are amazing and it's a really sweet story.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Its a good game but not for a young child. My daughter is 5 and its tooo advanced for her.would love to have a my little pony game for younger kids that watch the shows.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|Not a great horror movie and it really felt like a B rated budget movie as 90% of it takes place in a single house with the lights off. Like others have stated already alot of reactions to the \\"bump in the night\\" doesn't make sense as a normal human would flick the light switch on. 2 stars because it was really bad but I've seen worse. If you want to see a great horror movie watch The Shining.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I found it light and enjoyable.  Far fetched, but a fun book.  Easy reading.  First book I have read by this author.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Wonderful wholesome story without vulgarity.  Easy to follow and understand.  This movie emphasizes good honest values rather than shallow outward appearances.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|This movie kinda drug on and on. Slowwwwwwwww but sure to get to Mr. Boogie.  Suspenceful at moments. The lighting was way too dark for me. Couldn't make out much. Broad daylight outside and it looked like midnight thruout the whole movie.  It was ok.  Give me Pinhead anyday over this movie.
B0094K1WZE|1.0|The movie is a boring collection of action sequences connected with shots of Tom Cruise sprinting.  The action scenes overwhelmed the plot.
B003CP72QK|5.0|As violent as this movie is, I felt for the law abiding citizen, But I felt for the young secretary burning in the car explosion too. This movie definitely has you going back and forth emotionally as to whats right and wrong.  Excellent movie.
B0052AC8C6|2.0|Wanted a fun movie to watch with a 5 year old and a 6 year old.  It's not a children's movie...it's not an adult movie.  After they wandered off to do something else, I watched the entire movie wondering who thought it was a good idea to invest in making it.  I would not recommend it for anyone.
B0047SHEAK|5.0|For a SciFi Alien gotta survive kinda flick, this was GREAT!  This one was right up there with Arny in the first Predator movie. This movie had a great cast. Adrien definitely spiced this up,  along with the spicy latina freedom fighter. Great movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this Omnibus. I always end up finding a series I like after the series is all complete and that's the way I like it. I love being able to read through everything without waiting for another (see Game of Thrones series). I read through these in a couple days and wanted more! Luckily, I was looking at other works by this author and found that he wrote three more books that pertain to this series so I immediately bought them as well and just finished the first shift. Needless to say, I love this series. I love the concept. I love the ideas. I love the stories within the silo.<br /><br />I've always been a fan of books I can immediately get lost in, and then when they are eventually over I always find an empty space inside me because I became so involved in a character's story then suddenly it's done. I feel like the characters are still living far away, underground, in a silo and I want to know how they are today. What was their last month like? How is their family? As if I could actually send them a wire and find out the answer to these questions. As if I'd waste a chit on questions like those anyway. This is one of those stories you will immediately get lost in and it's so worth the money! I mean heck, it's like stealing!<br /><br />I've recently come into exploring this genre of books even though I can now see at a young age I was drawn to it through the White Mountain series by John Christopher. My dad is and always has been a member of the Science Fiction book club and I always thought that was sort of lame, but now I'm finding myself recommending books for my dad to read! As soon as I get done writing this review I'm going to go ask if he's read this yet.
0307408833|2.0|About half the recipes (and the ones I wanted like scones, pie crust, etc) were all made with spelt flour which is not gluten free.<br /><br />There are numerous comments from 'famous' people in adoration of Erin and her baked goods.  They all say 'follow the recipes exactly as she tells you'.  Well I did and I think her method of only using agave nectar and coconut oil does not end up in a good product.<br /><br />Not to mention $$$$ if you think you're going to make these things on a weekly basis.<br /><br />You may have success with her recipes, but I found them to be flops from someone who is so highly acclaimed.<br /><br />Good luck gluten free compadres, all your hard work in the kitchen will pay off- keep using your noggin- keep at it!!!  Don't give up!
B008XG1X18|5.0|If you love Pinterest as much as I do, you will love this app. It's so easy to search and pin things using the app that most of what I do on Pinterest is done from this app just because I prefer this layout and interaction to what the website provides. I enjoy Pinterest as much as the next gal, and this app lets me take that with me. I'm not sure if this is a good or a bad thing, yet, but I'm definitely enjoying this app! Go for it, you will not be disappointed.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Period.  need more words, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah hablah blah blah blah blah blah<br />ok bai
B008M87GJK|4.0|I enjoy being able to read the BBC News on my KFire, but wish that it updated the stories a bit more often. That is my only complaint. Other than that, the app is fabulous and I use it about three times a week.<br />The sections are categorized and you are able to choose which ones to display. One of my favorite features about this app is that the content you have updated is available even if you are not connected to WiFi. You cannot get updated content, obviously, but you can read the last round of story updates you got. This makes for excellent commute or plane reading when you do not always have WiFi available.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey is absolutely wonderful! Even my husband loves it! Once you start watching it, you will want to watch them all! So I suggest you buy every season!!!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I only gave it a 1 star because I haven't been able to play the game on my kindle fire

B003O86FMW|5.0|If you like romance and action this is your book it's good because u can't predict what's going to happen because that's too easy
B009FZHYKU|5.0|this show is awesome the makeup and sets are so well done,you could almost beleive the world has fallen to the zombies
B0080M3OGW|5.0|Simple story made great by two of the best actors in Hollywood. These stories are lost in todays crashing cars and explosions.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|This story is delivered through a series of letters from a boy named Charlie. He never reveals to whom he is writing or if the person got any of his letters.<br />Charlie takes you on a emotional rollercoaster of love, hate, and sadness. He vividly depicts his freshman year of high school and the world around him. He is sort of a lonely guy, but when he meets two seniors, Sam and Patrick, he finally feels as though he belongs.<br />This book is amazing and inspiring. Charlie explains high school with brutal honesty, all of the gentle and sugarcoated events thrown out of the window.<br />I do not recommend this book to the faint hearted or anyone who shies away from true high school parties and what events may happen at them.<br />I loved it and I hope you will too.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|a movie about Germany rebuilding and living after World War Two using the lives of the two main characters to show the storyline
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book - really enjoyed it! Couldn't stop reading once I started and completed the book in no time at all.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I fell in love and I can't get enough! I could watch this season over and over and over again! The characters, the story line and the whole development is done so superbly. Finally, ABC actually produced something AMAZING!
B00881VLCE|1.0|Bought and paid for metro series and download never occured ):Free game was a lot of fun and easy to use.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|I AM SO HAPPY THIS IS FINALLY ON BLURAY! PLUS A DIGITAL COPY! I AM IN LOVE ALL OVER AGAIN. MY FAVORITE CHARACTER HAS ALWAYS BEEN CAPT. HOOK AND NOW I CAN RELIVE MY CHILDHOOD FILM IN HIGH DEFINITION.
B003R5C5JE|4.0|I ordered this for my SO because he absolutely LOVES the Back to the Future series (already got him the first one).  Unfortunately this one came with the windshield popped out, so I had to glue it back in.  I did a pretty good job of it but I'd have preferred to not have to do it at all.<br /><br />Otherwise the car itself is pretty accurate to the movie I think.  Will be getting the third eventually.
B008K8X0IS|5.0|This show is incredible. I am a huge Sean Bean fan which I why I started watching this series. This season blew me out of the water. From the acting to the directing to the lanscape and costumes, this show nails it. This collector's edition version makes owning this truly monumental.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Very good Calculator for Being Free And it has all the Functions a Real Calculator And it Has a lot of Functions
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|My 7 year old has watched this video I don't know how many times now!  Would highly recommend for any Monster High fan.
0743289692|5.0|I have to say reading Infidel was journey itself. The book is very moving and my admiration for the author remains as good as the time I was immersed in The Caged Virgin.
B00AEFVRB2|4.0|This film isn't for the faint of heart.  It is sick, twisted, and at times disturbing, but it is well made and all the actors are great.  I was entertained throughout and the ending...I didn't see that coming.  If you can stomach it, I definitely recommend.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love all the Angry Birds Collections. This game is so much better then the others because there are no ads, and you can now see the whole screen. I like playing anywhere when I am waiting or a riding in a car.  This loads of fun, my whole family plays and we all love it as well.
B009ME47H2|1.0|I tested the recorder.  but it failed to play back what I recorded.  No sound.  If it is that complicate to use it.  it is not a easy voice recorder.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|Glad I just rented it than seeing it in a movie theater.  Okay to see once, though if your having a down day, I'd probably see it again.
B003Y2BMVC|4.0|This is a fun movie! There is a five minute montage set to a GooGoo Dolls song that you'll want to mute.
B004856SQ8|5.0|I loved the A-Team back in the day.  This movie was true to its story.  I hate it when the have a great show then make a movie and its nothing like the show.  That is not the case here.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|considering the constant stream of drivel that the pop music market offer to us... this is the best thing Ive heard in years.  Honest american rock music with soul!<br /><br />maybe there is hope for the future :)
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I have been a fan from day one.  I think that the second season is even more Awesome then the first.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very nice game I love how it is your own horse. Competing in horse games the is very competitive. I think this is a five Star game.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am a big fan.  The third season is the best so far.  I wish that i had AMC on my tv so i did not have to pay for it tho.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the app! the numbers are big and I can easily get everything that I need to get done done fast. its great!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I enjoy watching this program.  The situations the characters get into are a little over the top, but is does depict life at the begining to the 20th century.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I've always been intrigued by neuroscience and after losing loved ones, curious about an after life. This book was extremely informative from a medical perspective and really touched on the spiritual perspective that often goes unspoken. It will make you look at life, and the after life, through new eyes.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My friends got this game on their tablets and I enjoyed it so much that I downloaded it to my Kindle.  We have a competition for high score going on, there are 5 of use; the age range is from 17 to 43.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Same concept as the origional, but the artwork just seemed more like a cartoon. The idea works but i liked the first one better
B0086700CM|1.0|My son downloaded this for the Kindle, he is 17.  He likes it somewhat but I found it to be boring (I am 43), I left it on the Kindle for him but I don’t play it.  By the amount he plays it the game must only be about a 2 star for him.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This was a real, heartfelt, true, uncensored peek into what it takes to become and continue to be a US Navy SEAL. Maybe more importantly what it took from them. We all owe them a debt of gratitude.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Basic free calulator, nothing fancy.  I needed an extra calculator and this one was a free addition to my Kindle so it is great.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Is a good game but at the start it does it all for you and your just pressing buttons and then when it's done on tutorial your left thinking what do I do now? But I got the hang of it and I like it now

B001NLCBJI|5.0|Parts of this movie were wonderfully funny and sweet.  Other portions were nothing less than achingly beautiful.  The film is well acted, the script is excellent and the direction was fantastic.  I keep thinking about it and want to watch it again.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|This book was a great story, kept me reading well after I needed to be somewhere else! I read it after watching the movie and really enjoyed the extra detail that the movie didn't have time for, especially the relationship between the two main characters.
B006TJXZ30|1.0|I still think yahoo mail is better. 1 star. Downloaded this for the girlfriend she still uses hotmail and yahoo but think she uses her yahoo more.

B006AZZPCM|4.0|Have used several other downloaders in the past...but this works better & faster than any of the others I tried.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Great movie and I am glad the wife and I got to watch it before the academy awards show came out.
B0011E9LBI|4.0|Great movie, the original. I wanted to view the first two movies before I watched MIB III that I just purchased.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|It's like snow crash but different in amazing ways.<br /><br />If you are a geek, you'll love this!<br /><br />I couldn't put it down!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Puzzles are easy to do if you have a quck moment of boredom. The are pretty easy but its a good time waster.
B009KHBDUU|3.0|Johnny Depp is funn to watch in almost anything (except for what they did to Willy Wonka)... but this definitely has shades of Beetlejuice and is worth watching once if only for the fun references to the '70s.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|ive only read a chapter of the book but i didnt think it would be this long of a book
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|It's tough to come up with something unique when making a time travel movie - but they did it.  Watch this movie - you'll dig it!!<br /><br />**spoiler alert** - although, it is a bit puzzling to wonder why they didn't just &#34;loop&#34; the bad guys directly into the incinerator to avoid all the potential liability.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Flipboard is FANTASTIC. It gets you to the content faster so you can spend time on what you want not searching for something you want.  GET it
B001DTPZNY|5.0|I loved this movie. You cant go wrong with Indiana Jones. A A A A A A A A A
B004SBS8LA|5.0|So if you've played other angry birds games, you know the score. It's fun, plus I got it for free. Double bonus.
B0040I09RM|5.0|What a debut season!  This show will suck you in!  We couldn't stop watching episode after episode.  I hated having to go to bed every night, I just wanted to keep watching!
B001NLKWLW|2.0|This book is just okay, it is rather long and since it flips between three different time periods and several different characters, it is at times, extremely difficult to follow. It had a good plot and theme, but the characters could have been more developed and the story could have been shorter. I did' want to stop reading it, but I was glad when it was over so that I could get a book that was little more engaging.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Overall I thought the movie was pretty good.  It was pretty action packed and kept me on the edge of my seat.  However previous 007 movies have been better.
B00873GRU4|5.0|loved it, couldn't put it down. I'm looking forwas to the last of the series to come out in Australia.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I often describe this show to others as X-files without aliens.  Such an overly simplistic view doesn't do the show any justice I am afraid.  The first season introduces the characters and throws them into many strange situations.  I hate to give away anything even though the show has finished.  I will say that the things that all seem unrelated often lead to a greater understanding as the seasons progress.  This is definitely a show you want to watch a second time through now that it's over.<br /><br />The biggest thrill for me is the stellar performances by John Noble as the incredibly complex Dr. Walter Bishop.  His presence alone raises the level of even the cast that might be otherwise forgettable, Jasika Nicole as Agent Astrid Farnsworth is one such example of a supporting actor that flow so well with the rest.<br /><br />If you missed episodes or fallen out of watching, having the first 4 seasons on prime is a great opportunity to see what you are sorely missing.
B0094K1K42|3.0|It was just ok! It didn't make the female gender look very good. She looked like a fool for her age.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book started slow. However when it picks up pace it is great! I really enjoyed book two. Can't wait for the movie!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Enjoyed all of it the acting and the story line. Have watched 2 seasons and intend watch all of the seasons.
B003B02O14|5.0|Having read everything that John Grisham writes, I was not surprised that The Partner was captivating from the very beginning.  However, I was not prepared for the ending!  This is definitely one of the best novels, meaning in depth planning and research, that I have ever read, from any author.  If the ending to The Partner is meant to be a prequel for another, then get writing Mr. Grisham!  Your fans await!
B0084670FU|2.0|The starting of the movie wasn't interesting, so stopped watching it. Didn't get to the point where Brad Pitt had his part.
B0095P31L6|4.0|I couldn't stop laughing this movie was so cute. Good job to the artistry of cartoons. Very detailed & worth watching.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I needed a show with a lot of series to start watching, and I really wasn't interested in biker shows (anything about MC's in the past has been a flop), but several guys recommended this to me. Boy do I love this show. It is absolutely amazing and so entertaining.
B004ISVH7U|5.0|This is an outstanding value for a real collector's piece. The music speaks for itself and the DVD is worth the price on its own
B004GHNIRK|4.0|It was not the best translation to read and that made the book less in tune with it's poetic beginnings, but hey, it was free so I really don't have much to complain about.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Fun game but extrememly frustrating.  Sometimes the items you need to find to open rooms or charge collections are almost impossible to get.  Some can't even be requested from &#34;friends&#34; and it gets to the point that if you want to progress in the game you have to buy the items for &#34;diamonds&#34;.  But, you only get diamonds by advancing up a level--and then you only get 5.  Or you can buy them with cash--real money, not the coins you earn.  This &#34;free&#34; game can get expensive very quickly.  I would rather &#34;earn&#34; my way through the game as opposed to paying cash to advance, but there are times when it is just flat impossible.<br /><br />Also, I'm playing on a Kindle Fire and while there has supposedly been an update available since before Valentine's Day, it's still Christmas at my Manor.  Last time the game updated itself, before that I was given the option by an &#34;Event&#34; that told me to upgrade.  This game can be played across many platforms and it seems as though each version is a little different.  Friends playing on iPad or Smartphones have options I don't seem to have.  Plus if you start on your Kindle, you can't pick up where you left off on your iPhone.  It would be nice to have the game be consistent across all platforms.<br /><br />It would also be an improvement if diamonds could be purchased with the coins earned within the game rather than being continually asked to purchase more diamonds.  I'd rather pay a few bucks for the game upfront than have the game wanting $2, $6, up to $99 every time you run out of diamonds.  To me this game is not really &#34;free&#34; as it's billed.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I skipped this when it originally aired not knowing it was from JJ Abrams. With LOST being my favorite show I can't believe I missed this entire series! I'm so glad I was able to watch it on Amazon. Simply amazing show!
B00A12VW86|5.0|A really good outpouring of punk music. I am not surprised that Greenday could come off with another classic album set. when they are creative they really have an outpouring of good tunes. Make sure to purchase all 3 albums in this set.
0385344228|5.0|I throoughly enjoyed this book.  In addition to its being  a good story, it also raised issues worth<br />thinking about.
B00AH34AUQ|5.0|I like the whole set. I like the way the songs flow from one album to the next. Genius. Bravo.
006074815X|5.0|What a book!  What  read!  I loved it!  THIS is a thriller and a memorable one.<br />Haven't found one to equal it yet.
B008NR8YTQ|5.0|A great performance by Gary. Reuniting with the original members from Jimi's Bands makes this album that much more special.
B00197YZ7M|5.0|I love this movie. I can watch this movie over and over. This is a must for any movie collection.
B000EHSVSC|2.0|This movie gives quite an objective view on what happened during the attack on Pearl Harbor, and that perspective definitely makes it worthwhile to watch. Yet what is missing is strength in character and acting by the cast, and an exciting storyline to support them. I was really disappointed that the \\"spark didn't jump\\" - the movie leaves the impression that the script was written by a civil servant, that the director was an accountant, and that the actors were postmen (not that I hold any grudge against these honorable professions - just as a matter of speech).<br />So: good to gain some insights in the attack (also the Japanese viewpoint) - but poor in excitement.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|My daughters love this movie! I would recommend this movie to anyone's movie collection. This will be a long standing favorite in my house!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|No other television movie has come close to Downton Abby. Sunday evening has been set aside since the first showing of Downton Abby.<br />Can hardly wait for season 4.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|First of all, this movie surprised me - in a good way.  It has some &#34;heart&#34; behind it, which I really appreciated.  I am a fan of the American Pie series so I am definitely not an update movie viewer, but I have to say - some of the jokes in this movie pushed the line a little too far.  Without giving away too much, the part involving poop was really distasteful and totally unnecessary.  Other than that, there are some pretty funny parts.  Ted is kind of a jerk but loveable all the same.  I wouldn't go out of your way to watch it, but if it happens to be on or you're bored - go for it.
B009ANP4F4|3.0|i really love the step up movies however, when i bought this one, i liked the fact i got a free download for it for i tunes although i had already bought the movie from i tunes. the others did not. which would've been nice. my biggest complaint is the others ones i bought came in a nice case with a movie cover that is a part of the case as to where this one has a plastic cover that slides off and when you take it off its just a clear plastic case with nothing- not even a scene selection that is usually on the inside. it just looks like a bootleg without the cover, there just nothing to it. in the picture it looks like the other ones i bought, but its not. i love amazon, i use it ritually, but i should have bought this one in person.
B0027P2ZWC|5.0|I absolutely love this soundtrack; this is, by far, the best cast that I have ever heard. I love having it on my phone; now I can listen to it all the time!
0743270754|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  From beginning to end, I was engaged and fascinated by the characters and what motivated them during this period in history. This is one of the few books I have read that I did not want to end.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Growing up in the 60's meant that James Bond was Sean Connery. I have to say that &#34;Skyfall&#34;  is one of the best so far.Sure there's alot of action & gadgets, but the STORY was well written. I guess I am getting old when Daniel Craig ,who I would consider<br />the &#34;NEW&#34; Bond, is portrayed in this film as old. I didn't care too much about seeing the original Bond Mobile totally wiped out.OUCH! Let's all hope that Bond will live on. I'm sure he will. As Linda Ellerbee always use to say at the end of her news show back in the 70's &#34;and so it goes&#34;.
B001XUKFAQ|5.0|Tried to watch this on a censored movie channel. When Downey went into the Never Go Full Retard speech, and they changed it to &#34;Full Special&#34; I knew it was time to rent it. What is wrong with America? What happened to free speech?
B00ARAO720|4.0|Interesting movie, didn't like the cop as an actor, fun movie to watch and keep you on the edge of your seat
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Well another very good on the edge book.I hope the third one is just as good as the first two were.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|it wouldent let me search anything. google is there to help you find answers. not this app.don't get it! I hates it.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app made my selling on e bay much easier, I couldn't get my photos on without it. GREAT DEAL!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|It was not what we expected.  There was a lot of sweetness and laughter, given the sense of humor and spirit of the main character.  What an amazing life in a gurney and iron lung.<br /><br />The entire cast is excellent and Helen Hunt is wonderful as the sex surrogate.<br /><br />Very explicit. Suggested for adults only.  Not for children.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game it's really fun I love it. It was so fun. I hope they can make more games like this
B00471TLZS|3.0|It's a fun watch from a movie history and special effects perspective.  The actors are great and believable and the special effects are fun.<br /><br />Not as scary as I remembered it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the series and wish that it was ongoing, this book had to be the best I've ever read. I'd recommend this this book to anyone, it's amazing. I loved the thought detail and the choices of adjectives in this book. I recommend you to read this, as It's truly amazing.
B002RI9QJE|5.0|Well written, interesting and really quite a fun read. I had actually noticed some of the behaviours described when I worked in advertising many moons ago - in Singapore.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Well done,  showed how calm, cool and with it these folks had to be to get out of Iran.  Depicted the plight of Iran and it's people.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|007 does it again!<br />Great action.  Great pace.  Plus it's nice to see that James Bond is human.<br />Want to watch it again!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Every time I've read this book, I've devoured it. Each chapter is like another bite of a savory dessert and I enjoy every morsel.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great way to watch past seasons of a favorite show! Been meaning to catch this one and now I can because of amazon!
0374214913|4.0|I liked the premise of this book and the way it incorporated the old with the new.  Fun and upbeat storyline. I would recommend this book to young adults and book lovers.  It made me want to write my codex vitae!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|A great story-very well put together-the best series I have read in years! The characters are very well developed and are integrated into the flow in a very masterful way. The plot-as well as all the subs are very well put together into a flow that happens in a very straightforward and normal fashion. As far as I'm concerned, they don't come any better than this!
B00BGDQNLU|5.0|I felt I had to post a review to counter the 1 star given this astounding film! It's an affectionate homage to Capra style comedies with great performances and an incredible production design. It's been one of my blu-ray \\"holy grails\\" and I'm thrilled to own it in HD!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved the detail and their perspective about married life (as warped as it was).  It wasn't predictable and kept me guessing.  Awesome book!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down...it consumed my day from the first page to the last.<br />I can't wait to start the second book!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved it thought it was a great read. Would highly recommend it. A really enjoyable story. My sister told me about it and have suggested it to several friends who all loved it.
B001JYEMOQ|5.0|The first time I saw The Talented Mr. Ripley I really liked it.  When I purchased it and watched it again, I liked it even more.  Tom Ripley (Matt Damon), by way of mistaken identity, is paid to go abroad and bring back home to America the son of a wealthy shipbuilder.  Jude Law plays Dickie Greenleaf the heir to a shipping fortune and his father wants him to stop wasting his life and come back to the family business.  Tom decides to take up the offer using his &#34;talents&#34; and the money from Dickie's father to insinuate himself into Dickie's life.  When they first meet, Dickie has some suspicions about Tom but they wind up bonding over their shared love of jazz, and along with Dickie's girlfriend Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow) the three enjoy a relaxing life in Rome.  Things are going great, especially for Tom who is living the life of his dreams.  They party, sail, and Tom ends up eventually living with Dickie and Marge. However, the relationship begins to take a turn by way of some strange behavior on Tom's part.  Dickie has already decided he is not going back home and he begins to tire of Tom and his constant presence.  When Tom realizes what is happening, things take a turn for the worse and Tom begins to use his talents for survival and a new life.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I read this because it was impossible to miss and everyone was talking about it.  I found it addictive in some ways and it was very easy reading.  I also understood that it wasn't intended to be sophisticated and classy BUT some of the writing was just plain embarassing and cliched not to mention repetitive.  If I read &#34;He's just so freaking hot,&#34; one more time I'd have screamed.<br />I don't know what I expected of the writing but I really didn't think it would be that bad.  Any potential titillation for me was just gone as I cringed at the corny dialogue and non existent plot.<br />I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoyed reading Danielle Steele but wanted it ramped up a bit.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Challenging fun. Good for whole family. Really makes you think outside the box to find the best route and fill the board.
B009VB97EY|2.0|I thought this movie was a big disappointment. Although there were some top-name actors in this, it seemed to be lackluster.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|We've seen this mulitple times, and I love it as much as my teens!  Even my husband got a kick out of it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great when waiting for my car to be serviced or any other type of waiting. Like it and it seems to work well.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was the February pick for my book club.  After reading the summary on Amazon I was not very intrigued.  I do not think the summary does this book justice.  I got attached to the characters very quickly and more or less flew through the book.  It evoked many emotions and the discussion at our book club reflected the complexity of the characters and situations in this book. Would certainly recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|the whole family loves this game..my son loves to feed and train the horses and cant wait to level and buy new horses.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|What a welcome change from the espionage/thrillers, murder mysteries, shlocky romances, and other formulaic storiees that crowd the bookshelves these days! This book is a brilliant concept.<br /><br />Others here have already discussed the premise. I'll just add my voice to those praising the book as a riveting story, told wonderfully well. I found myself anxious to get back to it, something that doesn't happen very often for me. I can enjoy a book and finish it, but I seldom find myself as engaged as I was in this book, starting on the very first page.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and read \\"Room\\"!
B00AC8ZJ6K|4.0|For the budget and actors, I thought this was so well done. My wife knows nothing about Halo and she loved every minute of it. Wish they could have explained it a bit more because you may have questions if your not a gamer.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|very good, the main character was very interesting. It is hard to say if he was good or bad. Good overall
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Enjoyed it but some parts are tough to watch. You really get a sense of how tough and dangerous times could be. Title says it all!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Really enjoyed Argo and was glad it won Best Picture too! Well done and keeps your interest. Also takes me back in time to the 70's when it was actually occurring - all of those memories...especially the other hostages (not in this movie). Argo really cpatured the times and America living through the crisis...I have never forgotten it.
B004EK926K|4.0|Kids will not care for this film but in truth its one of the most accurate portrayels of Dickens work!
0446585041|3.0|This book is an fast and easy read.  In the beginning I truly laughed out loud, and was so happy that I purchased the book.  But then as you read on it's like she ran out of ha, ha's and just threw the words onto the page to fill them up.  If you really want to read this book, don't buy it, go to the library or borrow it.  I'd just give it an okay, and was a bit disappointed.
B0095R64AO|3.0|Thought this would be a horrible waist of money when my wife chose it for movie night. Not good but not awful
B003F9G8B8|5.0|Based on a true story .  Loved everything about this movie. The acting was commendable.  It's a good family movie.
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|I am not a big surfing fan, but I have to say that this movie was very inspiring and fun to watch and enjoy as a family. It has a strong message that is good for the whole family and one that I want my kids to learn from. The acting is strong and though I never saw this in the theater by where I live, I wish it had gotten more theater time as I know that others would have enjoyed this as much as my family did! The movie is based off of a true story, and I have to say that these are the type of movies that I typically do enjoy and this did not disappoint. The movie was well done, and definitely stirs the emotions in many places throughout the film. The movie makes me want to go to California again soon as the scenery is simply awe-inspiring! All-in-all this was a great movie that I would encourage all to see!<br /><br />*I received a copy of this for an honest review as written above*
B002VHI8FE|5.0|I finally got around to reading this after several friends suggested it. I was highly impressed! The story kept my interest and had the right amount of ebb and flow. After reading it, I had the same tingling in my loins that I had after first reading GRRM.
B008ROZAQU|5.0|Great action & story, fantastic animal shots in this movie & of the land.  Everyone will enjoy this classic movie. .
B0037NVM1I|5.0|It's the best action move of all time, people. Do you really need to read my review to believe this?
B008O037RG|5.0|Awesome vinyl. It just won a Grammy Award what more do you expect? Works great with my record player too.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Epic Adventures, Cursed Onboard.  The game moves slow, graphics are ok. The sample was very short, it took longer to download then to play. It is cheaper than other games.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Finally feels like a true to form Bond movie. Also a badass action film of its own. Definitely recommend it.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|it dose a lot of things it works for me on my kindle fire the first day to use it scares u probly if u are not use to alarms till u found this awesome app plzz get this app and make ur on review about it plzz
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Awesome movie. Not as good as the last one but that is an unfair comparison. It is a great movie on its own.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. It's great to pass the time and it is very easy and fun to play. The graphics are smooth ans beautiful and there is no lagging that I have seen.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this show !! Just started watching Season 3 now I am all caught up..<br />I want to see more its so additive. The fashion is wonderful.
0375842209|5.0|Do we need another telling of lives affected by World War II? Yes. We do. As long as Marcus Zusak is doing the talking. \\"The Book Thief\\", Zusak's latest novel, isn't like one you've read before. It's as if C.S. Lewis' Screwtape met up with Lois Lowry's \\"Number the Stars\\" cast, of youth fiction fame. The result is a smart and endearing story of a preteen who, although she steals a few books, is thoughtful and selfless, and the alternating curt and empathetic narration of Death - yes, Death - who despite our preconceptions of the reaper, makes for a good tour guide, reassuringly stating, \\"I urge you - don't be afraid. I'm nothing if not fair.\\"<br /><br />Liesel Meminger is a foster child in Molching, Germany during the Third Reich. She is cared for by the Hubermans, empty nesters who can barely stand each other. Hans is a house painter and accordion player. Rosa takes in laundry, makes inedible pea soup, and calls Liesel mostly \\"saumensch\\", a German insult relating to the word \\"pig\\".<br /><br />It's a rough start for Liesel, with daily nightmares and foster mom Rosa's cold demeanor, but the young girl finds friendship in the quiet and patient Hans, whom she calls Papa, and the delightfully deranged kid next door, Rudy Steiner, who thinks he's Jesse Owens. Zusak uses the characters to pause the larger and more dismal picture and focus on small joys. In one such instance, Rudy and Liesel find a coin in the street and take it to do what kids do when they find money. \\"Mixed candy, please.\\" Being that the coin was only a pfennig, they end up sharing a single piece of hard candy, taking ten sucks each before passing it back to the other. They walk home, red mouths and all, smiling along the way. \\"The day had been a great one, and Nazi Germany was a wondrous place.\\" The diametric theme drives the shaky graph-line of ups and downs. Death even delineates the book's thematic quakes, \\"the contradictory human being. So much good, so much evil. Just add water.\\"<br /><br />Circumstances soon bring \\"Papa\\" Hans face to face with a promise he made during the First World War. And so the Hubermans hide a Jew in their basement. \\"Imagine smiling after a slap in the face. Then think of doing it twenty-four hours a day. That was the business of hiding a Jew.\\" The layers of friendship and family are made rich by Max's arrival, and the range of life and death is deepened.<br /><br />Zusak's creative format and precise language provide interest and momentum. The narrator, with quick bites like, \\"A fire would be lit. A book would be stolen,\\" seemingly gives everything away, only to carry the reader to the next beautiful moment when nothing was actually spoiled but everything is realized and the rhythm of the book beats on in its steady, throbbing, idiosyncratic way.<br /><br />Although the full effect of Nazi book burnings, the marches of emaciated Dachau Jews, and Hitler Youth rallies are not hidden from view, \\"The Book Thief\\" is not gratuitous; after all, it is a young adult fiction, albeit one that should be read by adults, too. It assumes the reader to fill in the blanks, and is as much a story about life as it is about death. Just as the characters all find their diversion somehow - Death in colors of the sky, Max in weather reports, and Liesel her solace in words - so the reader finds wonderment in the worthy hearts of those pictured in \\"The Book Thief\\", if only to temporarily distract from the backdrop of atrocities that must also be told.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|This was one of the longest, dullest, and least interestng films I've seen in the last few months. Between the terrible soundtrack, the hero/drunk pilot and his live in heroin addict girlfriend, his estranged son, ex, and super nutty dialogue from John Goodman's character, I found myself compelled to fast forward to the end, which was, predictable.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Looking forward to seeing the film. Love the characters. Very well written. Reminded me of my youth. Great read. Highly recommended.
B00364K6YW|5.0|the best mini series in the history of the world!!  this has got to be my favorite movie of all time- i already have a copy- i bought this one for my sister.
0446582778|3.0|I have read all the Bosch novels (except Nine Dragons) and have been very impressed with most of them.  Many of them I've listened to as audiobooks, which heightens the enjoyment of the story.  I could not buy Angels Flight as an unabridged audiobook so I read the paperback.  I think by the end of Angels Flight Connelly finally pulled off a credible story of who killed Howard Elias, and why, and I didn't see the end coming seventy pages before the end, when you think you know who killed him but of course there are plot twists still coming.<br /><br />Where I have issues with this one is the murder of the girl, Stacey Kincaid.  Spoiler Alert:  There is no way in the world Stacey's mother, Kate, would have lived in a household for long tolerating that her 11-year-old daughter was being sexually abused, (and finally, killed). She would have taken the girl to safety, gotten protection, sued her rich husband for divorce and saved herself and her daughter.  After the girl's murder, it was so lame that she had to contact Elias using silly cryptic notes.  All it would have taken to tell him the story of what happened was a trip to the grocery story and a phone call on her cell.  That whole part of the story just didn't hold water and interfered with my enjoyment of the book as a whole.  I also did not like the overhype of LA's reaction to a cop having killed Elias when an African American had been on trial (and acquitted).  Connelly didn't need to tighten the tension of the book by making LA a tinderbox.<br /><br />Also, I think the bad guy would have taken Bosch out early (or at least tried to), as the two of them hated each other and the bad guy would have known Bosch wasn't going to let go until he found out the truth.  So all of these faults are why I gave the book 3 stars instead of the usual 4 or 5 I give Bosch novels.
B008EL25LE|5.0|Love this game!!  Plus it is great for my children also.  Makes them think outside the box when playing it.
B003U4UPHG|4.0|Fine acting but the &#34;I wonder what it all means&#34; bit gets real old real fast. Might check out some of season three but not with a lot of enthusiasm.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Absolutely wonderful site! Happy Pinning :) It is well worth every bit of your time to utilize all of this info~
B00A0SJ1RK|5.0|It's Annie Hall. Who doesn't like Annie Hall? Really good movie. Important to have in your collection. ... ... ...
B000ZI8E5K|1.0|might be good for americans,  quite annoying for all other english speakers i would imagine.  Guy speaks super fast and difficult to get into it.
1594487154|4.0|Dan Pink takes a subject, unfriendly and scary to so many and makes it approachable and yes, human. He creates a new ABC of sales. Instead of Always Be Closing, he applies the new attributes of Attunement, Buoyancy and Clarity. He offers some great exercises to practice these skills, several of which I have been using in the class in Digital Marketing I teach at NYU, for the explicit purpose of reinforcing how selling must be understood to be a better marketer. He makes a very good case for what is inherently human in the selling process and how all of us, every day are using these skills to some degree.    But is \\"the surprising truth\\" surprising? Not to me.  As a seasoned sales professional, I could not help noticing that so much of what the author speaks to as new to the sales process in the 21st Century, was what I had learned  in my early days in Radio when we had something called the RAB Consultancy Sell.    For more on my take on this book please visit my website. [...]
B004KBSQOW|5.0|listen to it all the time love it  too bad he isn't around anymore  I liked the way he sang the songs- put new into them
B00B7XGFO4|5.0|I have seen all versions of Jane Eyre with actors galore all good but this one has the best version not melodramatic as some have been but it's merely kind hearted and beautifully told. George Scott is excellent.
B001DCZ4IW|1.0|same old story- liked the first one better (actors)I really dont think I orderd this- got two of the other one
B008YWY0HK|5.0|this is a great movie i want my grandchildren to watch /be careful what you wish for!!!! a good learnig experiance  for all children
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I read the book in a week. The story is told so most non-military people will understand.<br />God Bless Chris and his family for their loss. Such a shame to survive the hell in war to lose his life back home while trying to help others.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I didn't think Taylor Swift could outdo her last album, Speak Now. I loved every song on it, as did my daughter. I was not afraid to let her listen to it either. I loved the innocence of it. However, Swift's Red album is perfection. My daughter and I love it. She loves the more pop sounds of We are Never Ever Getting Back Together. I love the somewhat more mature sound of songs such as Treacherous and The Lucky One. We love this cd so much that we bought the cd and the MP3. We can't wait to see Taylor live in concert this fall on her Red tour!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A visual treasure; rich, strong characters, engaging story lines....what else would you desire from television?<br />You will hang on every word from the Dowager Duchess, fall in love with the leading men, and covet the wardrobes of the Ladies Grantham.  The interiors alone make me swoon.  It's creator Julian Fellowes has given us a Masterpiece.
B003L77GRO|3.0|season 1, 3 and 6 are the best ones.  i was not impressed with season 5 at all after watching it....but its still needed to complete the series ion my collection
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Although, I did not buy from this seller the movies are beyond incredible! I've already watched them numerous times. I recommend buying it if you're a total nerd like I am. =)
B0049P1VHS|5.0|this show is fantastic.  season 1 is still my favorite.....the latter ones get into charcter definition waaaaay too much .  season one will remain the best because the apoclypse is so new and hectic and scary and real. more zombies less people problems!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Gives great insight into the life of our courageous navy seals.<br /> Lots of action. Love the detail and attention to reality.
B005FISBTO|4.0|this one is behind season 1 and season 3, but has some good spots.  some of the characters are gettign a little old, i think they need to die off some how.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|They pulled it out a third time, I loved this movie, I can't wait for it to come out in Blue-ray so that I can buy it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app. If you like horses you will love this app. You get to buy outfits for your horse and groom it. You also can buy other horses. Like a zebra. unicorns. and a lot off other horses. You feed your horse and you even can name him. The price is great too. FREE. I spent 5 hours playing it the first time I played it on my Kindle fire hd,
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I didn't think I would like this show when I first started watching it but I am addicted to it now. The characters are great and I have a couple of favorites that I really like. I wouldn't recommend this series to small children because it is very graphic. The effects look so real.
B0052BZ6X8|5.0|I thought this was an excellant movie.  The intencity level just kept building & building until the Fantastic conclusion.  The special effects were \\"way cool\\".<br /><br />The couple of bucks spent to rent this movie was well spent, Unlike the epic disaster of a disaster movie That I watched before this one; called 40 days & 40 nights. What a total waste of 5 bucks that was.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|My granddaughter got this movie for Christmas and absolutely loves it. She watches it over and over. This is a classic you never out grow!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I'm a KJVer as my pastor puts it. This Bible meets my needs and the NASB leaves so much out of the word of God I won't recommend it to anyone.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|They needed to button up the whole series so its only 13 episodes. Honestly, the last season is fairly depressing and rushed but as a Fringe fan of course I loved it and had to know how it all ended.
B007N9FKCY|2.0|I can certainly live without this game. My grandkids might enjoy it, I'll have to run it by them. Would difinitely not go out and buy it.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|I guess if you liked alien then go for it.  The whole thing was one disaster after another and it wasn't pretty lol.  I felt like the actual story was a little weak.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|It is not the best I have seen. They can not find my zip code. They allso do not show live camera shots.
B00AU15HPC|3.0|I don't think this was the best of Justin Hayward's solo efforts but &#34;The Eastern Sun&#34; may be his best solo individual song.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I just couldn't stop reading. Very erotic that keeps you on edge. I highly recommend this for all ladies :)
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Great season, hope for many more to come.  Read the books!  If you're not you're missing out, the only problem is you know what's going to happen in advance when you watch the series
B000I3UMLQ|4.0|A great &#34;old&#34; movie.  The quality was good and for the cost.....free with prime makes this &#34;rental&#34; even better!  Prime is the way to go instead of renting/buying your old favorites.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Very nice graphical upgrades to the first one. Just wish that loading screen in the beginning would be a shorter.
B000HZGNDG|4.0|A great &#34;old&#34; movie.  The quality was good and for the cost.....free with prime makes this &#34;rental&#34; even better!  Prime is the way to go instead of renting/buying your old favorites.
0060555661|5.0|This is an excellent book for anyone who invests in the stock market.<br /> It provides the keys to successful longer term portfolio management.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|Amazing Album! I would recommend this to anyone that wants to listen to good music. The Weeknd should def perform in my town.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|There's a reason they won tons of awards, this is such a funny show.  Season one is very funny!  Love it!
B00122Z9DS|4.0|Really good record like ti much better than clockwork angels more powerful and rocking songs some songs like faithless really dont resonate with me but thats their opinion.
B00782O7NE|5.0|I saw all of the movies nominated for the 2012 Oscar movie of the year before the Oscars last year.  I knew hands down that it would be The Artist, because it is truly an original film.  I bought this because it is a movie I will want to watch every few years for the rest of my life, it's an instant classic.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|The craftsmanship on the full tang blade is what you would expect from a reputable manufacturer and with a made in the USA emblem on the box. This is one seriously hefty piece of rugged metal. I even liked the presentation of the box it came in.<br /><br />The handle of the blade feels pretty thick in my medium to large hands. Not uncomfortable, but I wouldn't want it to be any bigger. The edge on the blade is sharp, but not as sharp as my ESEE 6 came, but not sure if I would want it that sharp. The plastic grip is ergonomic, but still plastic. The blade is thicker than the ESEE 6, and is probably more equivalent to the ESEE 5. Both the ESEE 5 and the BK2 definitely feel like knifes you want to use to egress out of a downed aircraft where you need some serious blade strength.<br /><br />I would echo some of the comments here about how heavy this knife is. I could see how I really wouldn't want to carry this for an extended period of time on my belt (it would be more comfortable in a bag), and it seems like something I wouldn't feel comfortable using in a hand to hand combat situation (I also own the SOG Seal Team Elite), nor would I feel like its the right tool for dressing an animal. The best application I would see with this knife is gathering firewood, and take care of basic survival and camping cutting needs.<br /><br />What really makes this a buy in my opinion is the cost ($59) as of Feb 2013 and the value you are receiving. I would personally take this knife if you didnt want to spend over $100 on a ESEE, didn't plan on lugging it for extended periods of time on your belt, and needed something heavy duty with great craftsmanship.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This was one of the most riveting movies I've watched. I would definitely watch it again. My wife loved this movie also.
B006PIXKVW|5.0|solid storyline, entertaining but not over done, moral with a satisfying ending. A nice movie for children over 10 that can possibly gain from the hope in this girl that never was defeated
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really enjoy the show Downton Abbey, but I was extremely disappointed in the season finale.  I don't think they will completely cut Matthew off of the show, or at least I hope they don't. I like the role that Maggie Smith plays because the things the character says are always hilarious... :P
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love it I just wish Luna was in it and that it wasn't so laggy and stuff like that
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game keeps me busy for hours! The different types of characters are awesome. Earning coins to buy power-ups is really fun! I really recommend this game to any one who loves too play unpredictable  games with fun graphics
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is a great app. Love the game! Very entertaining and addictive. So far the best I've played on my kindle fire!
B005HSL626|4.0|fun for my 4 yr old grandson he can play it by him self, and i liked that it was free
B00BESIKWM|5.0|Never thought that a part 2 could be as good or better than the original. But this one was. If you are a Silent hill fan you'll love this chapter.
158270208X|4.0|Overall it is a acceptable product, however there is highly detectable wear and tear on the surface on the front cover of the book.
B0068LYEHA|2.0|It was amusing but, for me, but not very thought provoking!!!  Maybe it is a good read for a woman who has not experienced being a woman yet!
B008Q08EV8|5.0|This movie and story line are EXPLOSIVE!!! I've watched the movie more than once and enjoyed it every time. Great acting and it will keep you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens.
B0085KGGHI|5.0|With all the great blues artists appearing on this dvd you can't lose with this one.  Muddy Waters is appearing and all of a sudden Mick Jagger and his part come in as guests and wind up on the stage - then Buddy Guy and so many others come into the club and up on the stage.  This is a keeper.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love playing this addictive game.  also good for integrating visual processing issues.  great if you have a minute or an hour.  safe for kids and no violence.
B008B3GP2A|5.0|Pretty much just what I expected. Great album for $2.99 on sale just before the Emmy's. There's a reason they're as popular as they are.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Really helps you to change your mindset from misery and enduring to enjoyment. Looking forward to implementing some of the lessons
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is adictive.  It is also educational in that the clothing and hairstyles and even bedlinens change as time progresses.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I would recommend this show to anyone. I really enjoy it. The actors do a great job, in my opinion.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|There are ready for me whenever I feel like blowing up green pigs.  Also, it entertains my husband when I don't want to.  :-)
B008HT4FUW|5.0|love the series and the discs are great and the quality is fine too. stop killing off characters!! i'm so bummed!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is filled with enough characters and story lines that make it relatable to everyone.  It will challenge and inspire you.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I believe adobe reader is required for any computer or tablet for opening PDF files. It works without any issues.
B0082FPIY8|4.0|I was recommended this book after the death of my mother. I found it a brilliant read. I loved Cheryl Strayed's honesty. She writes beautifully and I had the book finished in no time.
B004UIOUHC|4.0|I liked download. very useful and was good to use. met my needs and is worth the use. thanks amazon.
B001CW7MFQ|2.0|Seriously, this CD cost more than 3 normal cd's would at any store.  Bragging about it's Gold disc and &#34;Original Master Recording&#34;. Well, it's crap.  The original sounds better to me and didn't cost 1/10 of what this did.  What FNM needs is to REMASTER this glorious work and forget this OMR ever happened.  Dissappointing. Angel Dust is one of my top 5 &#34;can always listen to anywhere&#34; cds and has been since it's creation back in the 90s.  To do this disservice is just sad.
