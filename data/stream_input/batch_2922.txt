0788859544|5.0|It was great because it starts itself over when it gets to the end without having to do anything. It is really helpful for my 94-year-old mom who cannot get out of her bed.<br />Thanks, Helen
B00E5Q1LTY|2.0|If this is Star Trek, then I'm a Hottentot! Star Trek has always been better served as a TV series than a movie franchise, but these last two movies are the pits. The characters, the plot, the action - not one bit of it is believable.<br /><br />Maybe it's time to let Star Trek rest in peace.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I like what I have discovered, but know there is more to it than I know.  I haven't figured out yet how to get more short videos to watch yet.  Need someone younger, to explain to me how it works.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|There is a chance that one of your favorite albums from back in ze day was recorded at Sound City.  This movie is worth the watch, just because of that fact.
B002DJSBMA|3.0|The movie was okay but the original movies from 1934 death takes a holiday was much better.  It gave me much more to think about in regards to the present world I live in and the things I chase after and the spiritual world where non of these things will matter.
B007ZYJT1U|5.0|This movie packs a punch.  I like movies that make you feel.  This was one of them.  Worth the watch.
B003D5X3VM|5.0|One word....amazing. I had the pleasure of hearing him sing at a jazz festival I attended and he was phenomenal!! His voice/music moved my soul!! His music....I love it!! His voice...powerful and strong. A cd I would definitely recommend.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|While anticipating viewing this movie again at home on the 50&#34; panny plasma, I did not do one thing. I did not look to see if it was available in DTS. Why Paramount did not give the home viewer the option to watch this movie in either Dolby Digital or DTS is a real bummer.
B000I9WW6I|5.0|If you havent seen it you should. I'm sure you will love it as much as I did. They picked the best actors for this one.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|I was hoping this was similar to the gem drop at the casino. I got bored really fast. So sorry
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book was really good. Although, it was slightly hard to follow at times, but had an unexpected yet great ending. I highly suggest reading this book along with the whole series!!
B004BJMEO6|5.0|Why do lesbians sometimes try and be &#34;Straight?&#34; This one, Elena, not only tries to act straight, but she marries a minister and has a son.  However; destiny calls when her son is a teenager (so about age 16) when she meets............well I won't give it away..........
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Musical fans should really see this, but about the blu-ray itself - it is perfectly done all the small details are so crisp and colors are not misplaced so it makes a beatiful movie totally shine on a proper tv set :)
1608862801|5.0|I have enjoyed the book very much. The book was fantastic and funny. It was just like watching the show.
B002UD56I6|5.0|It's the last piece of Michael Jackson presented in all the blu-ray glory which is so memorable rewatching it it never gets old
1451695195|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK!  It is the most compelling read.  It's my little \\"go to\\" book when I really want to feel good.  It's my special little gift to myself that I look forward to.  It's like having a little treat treasure that's all mine when I want to have something sweet.  Its the best!<br />I keep learning more and more about the private life of a very brilliant man that I actually find interesting.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|A fan or not, this perticular album is really well done and i enjoy listening to it even without being a fan
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Even when you realize God listens to every thought and prayer we have, its great to hear from Him as we go about our daily lives!<br /><br />God is awesome, and provided a way to know Him via the written word.  Verse like Romans 10:9, John 3:16, the book of Revelation are so readily available  by this App.
1933492287|5.0|Really great inspiring artwork from the master. IF you are into cars and sci-fi this is the book to get!
B00B7ERH04|5.0|When I first received my kindle fire I was excited. Needless to say the ability to watch porn on a bigger screen then my Samsung galaxy was exhilarating. I immediately began cruising my usual porn sites and started sexting as is tradition, But soon the gravity of the situation would reveal its self. As I began taking my selfies I would soon realized there was no timer setting!?!?!?! (  WTF hasn't this been like a standard feature since like digital cameras came out???) ?!!?!?! Crushed and Dismayed I took to the app store and found an app capable of handling those responsibilities..... that's when I found your app. Now I can stand proud and naked without my huge arms in the way of my baby leg!!!!<br /><br />THANK YOU &quot;MAKING ART STUDIO&quot; FOR MAKING THIS POSSIBLE AGAIN!!!<br /><br />P.S. You have made allot of women happy, and that`s something we can all be proud of.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|Now a bad album, wouldnt say it's his best, could've had more original titles on it :) Anyway bought as a present for a fan, who really liked it.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I had seen Eleanor and Park recommended several times on my twitter feed recently. On Friday night at 10:30pm I found myself wanting to start something new. Fast forward to 3am with me finishing it with both tears in my eyes and a smile on my face. I couldn't put it down! Beautiful writing, characters I couldn't help falling in love with, and a love story that was fresh and unique. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll want to take Park home in your pocket. Highly recommend!!!
B002SHD9E2|2.0|Not very good. Pretty much pure schlock. Apart from Music of the Night mostly third rate music, poorly cast, grossly overdone.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Kept my interest throughout the entire book.  Took awhile to put everybody in there places.  Loved the ending.  Just goes to show you what might happen . If your not born.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Im here because they told me to rate it. It's an ok game I guess. Average. At least it's free.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|this product is new features. but has great potential. you can stream video from your phone while on the phone making a call, of course only through YouTube for now, and I guess from Netflix but I don't have it I wouldn't know. 30 something dollars is worth it .
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I gave this book a 5 star rating mainly because of the explanation at the end for the missing characters. Otherwise it would have been a 4. As usual I'm ready to start on the next book to continue the story but didn't like this one near as much as the first three. Still a good read overall though.
0743420373|5.0|Everyone should &#34;read and heed&#34; this book if they want to accummulate wealth.  You may not become a millionaire like the people they profile, but it shows through case studies that the habit of living below your means will put you in a much stronger financial position.  Unfortunately in today's society, the marketeers have convinced people to accummulate debt rather than wealth.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I can play this game for hours! It's very addicting, you don't have to be an expert card player, it's very easy to learn. Highly recommend it.
B0084B5TK8|3.0|I love Dracula, but I think it was a one time read for me. Great book, but just not what I was looking for.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love angry birds! Talk about being hooked on seeing little chubby birds kill piggies for points! It's very addicting so have your charger close by!
B005ZMUZDU|5.0|This was a favorite movie of mine growing up and I am so happy I bought it because its a movie that I can enjoy with my kids. Great family movie.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|Really enjoyed it, I watched it with my family. I recommend renting it's not a movie that I would purchase.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is very nice. The layout is simple and easy to grasp and the options for the type of format you want are cool too. Mostly what I loved about it was that it gave you just about all the info that you would want in the morning when you wake up, such as the weather details and ( most importantly) the time haha. I thought in was nice that I could use the 24-hour format rather than the 12 hour one myself. As well as all the other options it gives you to customize your clock such as whether or not you want Fahrenheit or Celsius. Digital or words or whatever you feel like. It's a good clock if you don't have one already.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|Lynne Olsen's story of America's debate prior to WWII, characterized in the persons and drives of FDR and Charles Lindbergh, is breathtaking in its pace and detail.  The intensify of the debate was as fierce if not more so then the divide we feel today.  What was especially revealing to me was the great reluctance of FDR to demonstrate leadership beyond a cautious, almost lethargic drive toward war was stunning. It make our present occupant in the White House very decisive.  We also see another president, FDR, using national security agencies to spy on, harass, and destroy his enemies.  It show perhaps how little we learn from our own history.
B002RI9R4S|5.0|I read this book as a teen in the early 1960s,as teens read A Catcher in the Rye, to try to anticipate adulthood.  I loved the book then, but knew only a bit about Oscar Wilde and was not looking for more than a veneer of the story.  Now that I am in my 60s, I am re-reading classics to find out what I missed.  Both readings of Dorian Gray impressed me with its imagination, the author's control over words and character, sheer delight of England.  Of course, as a teen, I didn't recognize all the homosexual references, or how many phrases Wilde used that later became immortal for their wit and sensibility.  This time, being very familiar with Wilde's life and work. it was a joy to run into these phrases over and over again.  In the book I read just before Dorian Gray (& Sons by David Gilbert),  a character posits the irony that Wilde didn't name this novel the Portrait of Dorian Gray; such title would be more in keeping with Wilde's poetic writing.  A title can offer great clues to a work, and &#34;Picture&#34; does here.  My opinion about &#34;portrait&#34; vs. &#34;picture&#34; would be a spoiler, but I think many readers would agree with my answer and find it quite obvious.<br /><br />Wilde's writing is some of his best.  Lean prose and colourful description, combined with strong verbs, but no verbiage, combine to make a quick read with great insight.  As a 21st Century reader, I was amazed that the theme of abuse of homosexual lovers applies equally to heterosexual abuse.  I hadn't remembered the book for more than its homosexual themes.  As we have evolved at last into a more tolerant age, A Portrait of Dorian Gray seems all the more relevant,  and deserves a place among required reading for teens.  Also for adults!
B002PYW26O|5.0|This was a great movie.<br />It was well made, fun, and nostalgic.<br />It really brings back memories of yesterday's TV.
B005LAIIMG|4.0|I never liked zombie movies before but this one is different, the story is both novel and has interesting twists which keep you interested till the end. I think more could have been done to make it better, but what was there was good. I did like the ending which I think will lead to a sequel.<br /><br />The characters are reasonably interesting. I am getting a bit tired of a reluctant hero but still..<br /><br />The acting is good, I do not think brilliant but more then good enough.<br /><br />I would see it again and I would recommend it.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|The graphics are great and nothing beats swinging a sword and killing demons. Excellent. I highly recommend it. And it's challenging enough to things interesting.
B006BFK5DK|5.0|Earth, Wind, and Fire has had many, many great songs and hits over the years. But in my opinion, this is the best ALBUM. Here's why:<br /><br />As I said, EWF has had so many great songs, and yes, some of those songs are better than anything on this album. BUT, when this album is taken as a whole, this is their best effort. There is not a bad song on this album--the only thing you'll get here is stellar, great, and good. The thing is, any other album of theirs contains a hit or two for the most part and some great songs besides, but there has always been some \\"filler\\" that hasn't caught my fancy. This album, on the other hand, keeps my attention (and doing a fair bit of head-bobbing) through the whole thing. And the ballads are jaw-dropping gorgeous (like Got to Be Love). They are all tight and grooving.<br /><br />The instrumentation is great--Verdine White's bass tone (and playing) is to die for. Production is great. Vocals stellar (can't believe Phillip Bailey can still hit those notes in the stratosphere). Song writing top-notch. I just cannot find anything about this album that strikes me as anything less than nearing perfection, especially considering the musical wasteland we live in these days. Although this is certainly the familiar EWF sound, it's a breath of fresh air from the garbage on the radio. This music is crafted by talent, not thrown together choppy, annoying sequences from wannabe musician/composer DJ's turned technicians, sporting gimmicks like runaway warble-heavy pitch correction used on tone-deaf, talentless pretty faces and cheesy Casio-sounding drum machines. Such garbage. This music, on the other hand, breaths. It moves. It's real. Alive.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|pretty good, decent depth definitely worth it to kill time has interactions with the characters from the movies for missions
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book was interesting and very engrossing the more I read the more compelling the story became.  There were several times I had gotten so into the story line I actually had to stop and think about what it would have been like to be there...
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Took a while to get all the characters & stories, but then was awesome! Pulls you in to all the story lines.

B000FC1MOQ|5.0|I gripping account of a young addict and his desperate attempt at rehabilitation.  Anyone struggling with an addiction or wanting a first-hand account needs to read this book.  The book is longer than i expected but reads very quickly.
B00AQ71FLK|2.0|Nothing different from the other MMOs that I have played and I think that's what really kills it, The lack of originality. Not a bad game, Just didn't care for playing the same thing over and over and over again.
B00422LESO|4.0|Loved it and read it in two days, even though I saw the movie first. An easy, fun read. Get it!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love this game, very addictive and well worth your time to play it. This is a great game to anyone you like to find things, and people who like mysteries. I love this game so very much. I highly recommend this app to all.
0385474547|4.0|I bought the book for my ten year old to help him appreciate the setting in Africa pre-colonial era. A story of a man (Okonkwo) who would not want the weaknesses of his father be his portion and thereby overdoing things (by our modern day standard); a man who went to the extent of killing his beloved adopted son to prove that he was a &#34;man.&#34; A depiction of a traditional African man.

B00AYB0TOW|4.0|fun not really for kids under 14-15 on the violet side lots of blood and gun fire<br />beyond that well done good remake
B005EHQGTS|5.0|This app is one of my favorites.  It does exactly what it says and does it efficiently and cleanly.  I am able to completely control my PC from my android devices and watch streaming video from my computer on my android devices with beautiful clarity and sound.  I got this as an Amazon faotd, but think it is worth every penny it costs.  5 stars!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use this app for meditation, for background music while I am working as a massage therapist, for soothing ambiance while writing. Love this app!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini's has yet to disappoint as he unveils still another valuable insight into lives that most of us do not<br />witness up close and personally. He is a rare and wonderful word-painter.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I am a huge fan of puzzles and escape games. The Room is one of the best by far. Clever but logical puzzles and a hint system that does not give spoilers. This game will stump you, enrage you, delight you, and make you beg for more. I can't wait for part two!!!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I was hooked on this since the beginning. It's one of the best series and I  can't wait for next season to start
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|What a delightful way to combine two of my favorite pastimes!  Realistic sewing graphics add to the fun of out-of-the-box thinking.
0399213015|3.0|While I appreciated the cost, I did not realize I was ordering a small book. Read more thoroughly than I did.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|series 5  was one of my favorite series  from start to finish. seeing amy from her frist meeting the new DR . and then seeing him 12 years later as an adult and then feeling like the doctor had to make things right for leaveing her  when she needed him, then them going on adventures together  felt right. I miss the ponds . and wish matt smith all the best in life. Thanks for alot of good memories.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|I truly couldn't put it down! the characters were vivid, and the story believable even if it's not in my world.
B007CFL4WO|5.0|I loved this book. It deals with two subjects, firstly, with the love story and seconly with the socio-anthropological analysis of the post war german people. The two themes blend together magnificently, and they are both as interesting. this book has a lot of soul, first of all it is very well written, and it s also bittersweet, sexy, heart breaking, touching, and very informative at the same time. I m not a fan of world war two (dont mean in a &#34;yayyy this war was awesome&#34; way, but in a &#34;wow this war is so friggin intesting), but it managed to keep me glued to the story. Also, i read the last few chapters at the beach and i started sobbing uncontrollably, and my husband had to give me the &#34;people are staring, please stop reading or hide&#34; look. So i just chose to hide under two blankets and continued reading instead.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Excellent music.  I just keep playing it. I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the play or movie. Very enjoyable.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I use this app to download study books and magazines. It's easy to use and stores all my completed material for future reference. You can highlight in various ways and add notes. You can change font sizes and styles. Works well for my needs.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|OMIGOD. That's all I have to say. IT WAS SO AMAZING!!!!!!!!  It was definitely the best movie I've ever seen in a loooooooong time.
0470601787|5.0|Great tools,  I never imagine drawing can make a big difference in sharing ideas, your business or ministry will be really benefited from the books. To read the whole series available is much better,
3836538725|5.0|It´s one of a kind. Just marvelous. It´s a keeper. I saw the photos in Rio and bought a book in portuguese for myself. Later on I bought the english version as a gift.
1118156315|5.0|Very practical, easy to implement, deep info, nice looking pages, recommend to read other books available from the same author.
B002KVZBGA|3.0|Didn't live up to the hype. Some good scenes but some of it was just dumb and pointless.  The chase scene getting out of town is worth watching the rest of the movie for.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I have grandkids that are ages from 6 years old to 11 years old.  They really enjoy this app.  Fun watching them try out their many different hairdo's and laughing over what they created.

B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I absolutely loved the story, but I HATED the ending. I mean common WTF was that? I couldn't wait to finish the book and see the happily ever after of Eva and Gideon, but was very disappointed to find that there will be another book. And after reading some review I come to find there will be TWO more books! I'm so done with this story, and with Sylvia Day. So upset.
B0058SNI94|5.0|I wasn't sure what to anticipate.  I am traveling to India and wanted something comfortable and easy to wash and wear and I slipped my foot into the size 8 (normally wear 8.5 and once in a while 9's) and 8's were great.  Thanks for all the other reviews to help me decide on size.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Very good book for some who like me don't have a lot of knowledge, well written and very interesting. Recommended
B004N44SOI|5.0|They released a great record as usuall. No filler songs with this band. Hopefully they get together and write another.
B009C7ZQM4|3.0|It's ok but not good. It says it cleans it but I don t see any difference. Could use alittle more work.
B003G4W49C|5.0|My youngest sister and a nephew recommended this series and read book one in one week.  Fast reading, interesting, author got inside of the childrens' heads with the insight that children are people too.  The intro by the author explained so well, which I can never explain to anyone, why the &#34;genre&#34; opens up a whole new world of imagination that can very well become reality.  I am now reading Book 5, out of sequence as recommended, to keep the natural flow of the series.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|You cannot go wrong with this album! I only wish I could preorder the second album, Perhaps Love.  Jonathan's vocals are amazing!  ♥

B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was awesome and it kept me wondering what was going to transpired nex I will read it again
B000002KB8|5.0|a few years back the UK got remastered versions of the original run of Ozzy era sabbath albums. thought we'd get them stateside shortly after. never happened. so often remasters sound so similar to the previous cd pressings that they're not worth replacing your old copy. not the case here. the remasters sound incredible. these albums will always sound a bit muddy, it's how they were recorded, but it no longer sounds like your speakers are under a blanket. You already know the albums, I strongly recommend going to the Amazon uk store and order the 2010 remasters.

0988178532|5.0|Outview is a coming of age adventure that takes its hero, Nathan Ryder, headfirst into a conflict with a hidden government agency, and the shadowy villain at its head seems to know more about what Nate is capable of than Nate, himself. Nathan learns he is one of the `Seven', psychics born to his generation who are the hope of a great awakening to the power of the soul, and the story takes off in brilliant flight.<br />There is a lot to digest in the story, and it is an intellectual challenge to keep up, to learn, to grow with Nate and his friends. Personally, I love stories that ask me to participate on this level, to teach as well as entertain me. Outview is well worth the investment. There is a lot of truth here, too, a powerful message about the interconnectedness of all life that people today are missing, which transcends the adventure itself. This is a series everyone should read.<br />I've started the next book in the series, Outin, and it is already as engrossing as its predecessor, and I can't wait for the final installment.<br />I received this copy to write a fair review.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Very easy to use love the gradual wake up option would recommend to anyone too busy to be bothered with a normal alarm
B0007LGCB8|1.0|You read reviews where one person loves a product and another hates it. Some reviewers conclude that some products are very different even though they have t he same name and manufacturer. Perhaps that's the situation with thee Keen sandals. Mine looked great but were uncomfortable to the point that I knew I would never wear them. I was looking for a second pair of sandals in addition to my Tevas for walking and hiking. I am not heavy or out of shape, so I don't place extra stress on shoes. These Keen's were advertised as designed for just this purpose, but it was clear from the soft, unsupportive heel strap and the lack of arch support, that they would have been a disaster on a hike. If you only want shoes that look good, and don't really care how they feel or support, then they are the sandal for you. Otherwise, try something else.
0671449028|4.0|this book is alright, it's short and to the point, it could have some more wording though, but its alright.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Very good season, great episodes and in my opinion the best season so far. Maybe this will be something that stays good after a 5th season.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is one of my favorite series ever. I can't wait for Season 4. I love that I can stream it via Amazon Prime!
0399165274|5.0|As usual, Forsyth writes a spell binder. He never disappoints and this book is no exception to that tradition. I recommend the book.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|This story is just very well told.  There is a lot of driving - which seems to be the new thing with Lee Child; he seems to keep Reacher in the car a lot in the last couple of his books I've read, other than that it is a story that is compelling and make you yell out loud a couple of times.
1905783965|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3H2TXWY36TRNO]]THROUGH THE IP COMPLEXITIES OF GLOBAL IT<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />If you are not an intellectual property specialist lawyer, you may well have wondered what mechanisms or instruments are available to protect inventions -- and inventiveness -- in the area of IT, encompassing electronics and software.<br /><br />Or, alternatively, you are already an intellectual property practitioner with considerable familiarity with this area of law.  Either way, you will find this new title from Globe Law and Business incredibly useful, particularly if your practice is international, which it inevitably will be if your clients are involved in the development of innovative IT solutions and strategies.<br /><br />The book is, after all, `a global guide to rights and their applications' as the sub-title clearly indicates.  And certainly the protection of these rights has become a core activity in the unceasingly innovative and competitive world of global IT.<br /><br />Providing practical guidance on a vast range of IP issues in the major jurisdictions worldwide, this multi-authored work under the able editorship of Nicholas Fox places the collective expertise of at least thirty-five international contributors at your disposal.<br /><br />As a solicitor and patent attorney at Simmons & Simmons, Fox points out that the development of a forward looking, alert and workable IP strategy `can act as a litmus test' on the part of electronics and software companies for demonstrating their business competence in other areas of business.  With the needs of such companies in mind, there is no doubt that this book, with its rich resources of international expertise, can help achieve that end.<br /><br />It is the international orientation and approach sensibly favoured in this book which makes it especially useful.  As the editor explains, `the boundaries of what can or should be predictable under trade secrets law vary in different jurisdictions, as  does the approach of various countries to the protection of computer programs by copyright and the extent to which copyright and unfair competition law can be used to protect against the copying of the design of physical products.'<br /><br />For ease of use, the book is divided into three sections, the first, which focusses on global issues, starts with an introductory survey of international IP instruments relevant to electronics and software.  Parts II and III emphasize respectively, a European focus followed by an overview of IP issues in the major non-European jurisdictions, namely Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, South Korea and the United States.<br /><br />As appropriate, various IP-related challenges are discussed throughout with impressive technical competence, including patent strategy, standards setting, licensing and other issues such as unfair competition, design rights and much more besides.

1452126577|5.0|the ultimate cat book for cat owners, it explains the world cats allow us to live in, dog owners should have one too
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter is having so much fun playing this game. This is the first time that this type of game has held her interest.
B00AEFY0F2|5.0|Tom Hanks is just the right person to play Forrest Gump, Forrest receives the credit for creating a lot of our modern society
0399165274|4.0|I just loved this book...while I agree with other reviewers regarding extreme technicality, lack of character development, etc....If you have ever wondered how a worldwide manhunt is conducted this is your story. I loved the search for the perfect agent for the job...the uncovering of the Preacher's identity...the involvement of the various clandestine services here and abroad...and all the equipment necessary for a job of this sort.<br /><br />I loved it!!!!!
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I was shocked when this movie was a good as the first. Usually in a series of on going movies the second is a let down. This is really good. The new ongoing early years as they introduce familiar characters from the Enterprise's travels when they were younger. Good flick.
B00C5R8364|2.0|An interesting story, but I found the lack of dialog and slow paced narrative unlike Forsyth's other efforts.  He has done better.
B00CXQL828|5.0|Great rock music from start to finish best I have heard in a long time hope they can do another cd
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Loved this book. It was jarring to read accounts of orphanage cruelty among the lightness of a bachelor farmer looking for a companion, but necessary to lend to the story. Interesting that Christina used brand names throughout her descriptions. It wasn't a canvas chair, it was a Parker Knowlea. It wasn't bluing, it was Reckitts Blue. Etc. There was a moment of horrible suspense of the outcome and one clue that gave an important part of the story away, but all well done.
030758836X|5.0|Wow this book....<br />I don't want to ruin it, but you should read it.<br />Keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time.
B0060CX8F6|5.0|good music, funny animals, happy ending, new orleans setting...what's not to love about this movie<br />(beware, though, the voodoo parts may be a little scary for little ones)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't personally play this but my kid does and they love it.<br />I've seen a few of the things they've built and wow. Not only is it a game for adults but kids too.<br />Very fun game for their creative minds.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I'm the same age and lived in Detroit and suburbs all my life but had never heard of him.  Great tearful story of a well deserved comeback
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Love the movie the sound track is just fun to have. I can play it on my phone and run around to listen to my hearts content
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|down loaded  and have never had occasion to use it. Have no idea one way or another....beep beep beep beep
B003TYFG8K|5.0|I am in my mid twenties and i am seriously a huge fan of star wars and have always been a huge fan of legos. I had this set when i was younger and it got accidentally taken in a bin full of other star wars legos when some people came to clean out the garage..  i was very upset and now have a job that can support the cost of my obsession with legos and star wars!  i had to get this set again. it is the newer model with a jedi and the first set of the ARC fighter that came out just had two clone troopers with it. its just as good as i remember it!  its a fun build
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Awesome show. The characters will have you attached with all the left and right hooks that are thrown at them throughout the season.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I love British Television and this is a great show that really feels like you know the characters! The only sad thing is that there are only 4 seasons... I can't wait to read the books!
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|The music has a good beat that sticks in your head.  I love singing along with it, even when I listen at work!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|love it. it is very good game to play love finding things. an clues. i have a lot of thiese game.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I love these especially the multiple tips on this stylus.  These were given as door prizes at a local educational conference and were a big hit.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Great book I love this book it is so cool I wish I were a demigod. It would be so cool because of all the adventure.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is a very good book and well written I thought. I would recommend it to everyone. I will read it again
0307454568|5.0|I loved the tension and plot of this novel.  I am devastated that this author will never write another word.  I would have read everything - and did so - but I wished for more.
B0002HZSE4|5.0|My niece loves this! It is just the right size to use with Barbie Dolls. Would be great if it included a little info on the breed since this breed is not seen much in America.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|You're on the edge of your seat the entire series.  It is the best of all the 24 series produced.
B002N21UKM|5.0|this movie is one of my all time favorite movie, I think I watched this movie more than ten times!  great theme, great actors, great movie!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|i like this game it is very very challenging and also it is a<br />very very fun two thumbs way up
B00170F0WU|5.0|I absolutely love this movie!  Jean Reno and Natalie Portman should get oscars (or did they?)  Thrilling, exciting, caution some violence
B007THA4FI|2.0|I was disappointed with how she made each character out to be some kind of perverted monster, then everyone was fine and dandy at the end.  It was just a bit unbelievable to me.  I felt like I needed to wash my mind after I was done.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I must say that I love Despicable Me. This is the perfect game to complement the movies. It is based on the principles of Subway Surfers, but has many more things added into it. More goals, worlds, better graphics. The only bad part is that it takes a little bit to load, but the great gameplay completely makes it worth it.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|I really wanted to like this movie, but it just wasn't very good. The story was interesting, but too many plot points just weren't logical. The suspense was a bit forced, there were just too many moments meant to make you jump, so I thought they became less effective as the movie went on. Also, if Mama looked a little more human I'd have found her scarier. The performances were good, despite the ultimate lame-ness of the plot. The end was so-so; I don't think I'd call it a \\"cop out\\" like some of the other reviewers, because it wasn't what I expected, but it was definitely not satisfying.<br /><br />Also, several reviews mention that this is not up to Guillermo del Toro's usual standards. That's because, despite how it is made to appear in the official description, he did not direct it (he was a producer).
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie, plan to buy it when it comes out on Dvd. Tom Cruise does a good job in the movie!
B00BP29SAA|4.0|Fun and interesting for the kids (5 & 7).  It's not really a game.  You cannot get points, beat levels, or win the game.  It has lots of fun little activities in and around the supermarket.  It is cute.  It runs very well.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|This is the best App I have found for word and excel on my kindle fire. It takes a while to figure out how to use it properly but I am learning. I recommend it to anyone looking for this type of program. You just have to be patient in the learning process.
B0087EACJK|4.0|Interesting concept, implemented well.  Sliding puzzle pieces make up the layout of the level map.  Not only do you need to rearrange them to finish the level, but you've got to beat the clock too.  I like it, my kids like it, and it is challenging enough that we'll keep it installed for a long time.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|No spoiler here.  We just weren't as enthralled as we were by the first one.  It's Star Trek though, so for any die hard fan, it's a must see.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me after he gave me my Kindle (NICE friend!) - it is by far one of THE BEST BOOKS EVER!!!!<br />READ it - I mean READ it - it says so much about what so many of us have lived: &#34;...it's the good we did that can save us. But then, when salvation speaks, the secrets we kept, and the motives we concealed, creep from their shadows. They cling to us, those dark motives, for our good deeds. Redemption's climb is steepest if the good we did is soiled with secret shame.&#34;<br />There are so many places in the book that we can all relate to - about love, life, experience - it's SUCH a good book!! Hard to explain, but you'll get it.<br />It's a fast read too - hard to put down.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|I bought this for my husband. He's watched it so many times I'm surprised it still plays.  Good gift idea for super-power fans.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|BAD DIRECTING, BAD ACTING, BAD PLOT, BAD BAD BAD BAD  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY...DONT WASTE YOUR TIME. THIS WAS TRUELY TERRIBLE
B000SE0OYA|5.0|very good product, perfect for what I needed it for.  Arrived on time.  Just as described. I will order this product again when needed.
B00ARF92HK|2.0|Nope.  Wouldn't waste my time on this movie.  I did no hate it but it was a waste of my time.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|very good product, perfect for what I needed it for.  Arrived on time.  Just as described. I will order this product again when needed.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great book can' wait to read more of this story. It is hard for me to get evolved in a book this captured my senses.
B000IZ6FLK|5.0|This movie is creepy in a good way.  It is a really interesting story and can be a little hard to follow at times.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I have watch DR. Who for decades. Started watching while living in England.  This is a Show that is always interesting. We Love it.
B00499QUK2|5.0|A smart and savvy adaptation of the books.  Some might say in these re-makes that Holmes' brilliance coupled with arrogance is beyond realistic possibility, but I say it's somewhat possible.  It is fiction, after all.  This is fiction that keeps you on your toes; not wanting to miss a word, which is difficult at the pace in which Cumberbatch will blaze away with his rhetoric.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Gave me something to do. Its the only game I could get that my friends had to. Not many apps connect to other company phones.
0374214913|4.0|This is a fast and fun read.  It's not a book that's meant to be taken seriously, but a lighthearted book with humor, a bit of mystery and intrigue, and likeable characters.  Its themes include \\"old technology\\" versus \\"new technology\\", the lure of the book, and the value of human interactions in an age of computers and machines.  This book can also be enjoyed by younger teens since it doesn't contain profanity, violence, sex, etc though adults may appreciate the book more than teens would.
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|Not enough information to show you how this works.  Don't have enough time to spend on this game.  People have really gone crazy on this electronic game of concentration.
B00BIR381W|4.0|this is a twist from the other seasons because certain things happen to certain people at certain places. CANT WAIT TILL NEXT SEASON COMES OUT.
B0015DWJ8W|5.0|Murakami's book about running, writing and life reveals some interesting facets behind his life -- but not too much. Although the book focuses on the role running (and, latter, triathlon) has played in his life, he also shares some fascinating stories about how he was inspired to become a writer, how he made the transition and how he works. This is a really unique and enlightening book.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I was anxious to see anything related to The Wizard of Oz, since I have seen it every year since I can remember and I am 51. Great job on this movie. Kept me entertained with fantasy and adventure. Great special and sound effects.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|Review on boxset, not content:<br />Wonderful boxset with a beautiful map. I really enjoyed all the commentaries, the director and writers especially since they talk about the process of the series, and little facts you probably wouldn't catch elsewhere. The opening menus for the discs are great, and not too annoying to navigate through with a keyboard (which is a plus lol).<br /><br />The only lacking part was that the HBO digital files were only available through itunes, and they were HUGE. I was excited for this so I could throw these on my smartphone to watch on the bus or while traveling, but some of the files being 1-4Gigs each, meant that will never happen. There was also no way to remove the 'special features' from these files (probably why they were so huge), which is unfortunate, since I'll watch the blurays for them....not so important while watching on the run.
B005T87QCI|1.0|I bought this game, and then I purchased some robots. After a while, it automatically updated and i lost everything I paid for.

B00EQUP3Q6|2.0|I've heard and read a lot of complaints about how this is a bad album because it doesn't sound like a Nine Inch Nails album.  That's not true: It /does/ sound like a Nine Inch Nails album, but a really bad one that was rushed and produced as an afterthought.<br />Most of the songs feature whisper-singing and very minimalist and poppy percussion.  Some of the guitar sounds like it was recorded from a tiny Danelectro amp being played in a shower.  The lyrics are silly--I get that Trent said that he's grown up and that that's a lot of what this album is about.  But I got the feeling that that's what With Teeth was, thematically: That he'd freed himself from the clutches of his various addictions and that he was an adult and didn't need destructive vices.  There's one really good track and I can't remember which one, at the moment, because I'm a little afraid of finding out it's not really that good after all.<br />Anyway.  Michael Trent Reznor, honey, it's getting late.  Please come to bed.  You're almost 50, sweetie.  It's ok.  Put the synth down.  You're scaring me, honey.
B0044C3RB4|3.0|the first two were pretty good. You wanted to see where is was taking you. The problem is it was on a stupid ride. It lost my attention when it went back in the 20's and then into cartoon world. Just stupid.
B0097EWK3A|3.0|does what it is suppose to do and does it well. No worries with buying this product of from this retailer
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I finished the first quest/challenge in less than 30 minutes. Well done, but I don't think I'll be spending $5 on the full version for that little entertainment.

B009J3K4MI|3.0|Update 10/29/13 I wrote the below using a 12 year old Harmon-Kardon CD player. Since then I have played the CD's on a Marantz CD5004 and a NAD 515BEE with no problem at all. So it appears that for some reason a few of the CD's in this collection may not play on some older players.<br /><br />This collection contains wonderful performances with excellent audio quality. However, of the first 7 I have played, 2 are completely unreadable by my Harmon Kardon CD player. Very disappointing! Another however, is that my JRiver Media Center PC audio software can read the 2 defective CDs perfectly with zero error correction required (the software reports all error correction) and the CDs play correctly using the PC and JRiver software through a DAC to my stereo system.<br /><br />So, buyer beware - these CDs are not manufactured very well as far as disc quality and some are very difficult for some players to read.<br /><br />MY boxed set was in original sealed packaging from a reputable source so they are not \\"rip offs.\\"
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Great app does just what it suppose to do.  I hate having to write mandatory word requirements. Just let me rate it and be done with it. blah, blah.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I've been enjoying this relaxing game for a while now and SUDDENLY there are commercials throughout the game!! Frustrating to say the least. Shame on you Amazon, Disney, and Microsoft; You've convinced me not to buy your new tablet!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|The humor and the mix of real life make this a great read. Proves the soldiers are why we are the best not the commanders.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|My wife and I see many Broadway shows but this one was one of our absolute favorites.  Because of this we bought the CD right away.  Yes, Cindi Lauper's songs are spot on but they mean so much more when you see the action on stage associated with each song.  Some of the &#34;pow&#34; facter is missing without the visual.  But we did enjoy the CD.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|It is such a cute movie3.  Really enjoyed the movie that's why I bought it and sent to my daughter.
B009WUBERW|3.0|Just didn't really care for choice of one liners. I guess I just expected more from the cast they had.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I just finished, while in my favorite coffee shop....tears in my coffee and worth it. Beautiful book! I will carry quotes in my head for time to come.
B005PK56TA|4.0|I gorged on the show and watched all episodes in a few days.  So many of my friends love this series, and while I did like it, I thought there were a lot of plot holes, introduced ideas that were never developed, and had jumped around too much.  If you watch it only once a week (as designed), you might not be bothered by that, but when you watch them all in a short amount of time... you an see a lot of the inconsistencies and such.<br /><br />However, I love the horror genre (which does not necessarily pride itself in realistic and consistent plots), and it's great to have a TV show do the genre pretty well.
B009O07NBQ|5.0|I was so happy to get this CD, the music is amazing. However, the cover was cracked. That wasn't a big deal but it would have been nice to be intact
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I don't have Showtime, so I always look forward to when the newest season comes out on video.  Now that Amazon streams it, it is that much easier to get!  If you have not watched this show yet, you are missing out!  The third season is a bit of a hiccup (it was during the writers' strike), but otherwise, it has always been strong with interested characters, plots, and villains.  Dexter is a true anti-hero drama and a thriller to watch.
0316216453|5.0|I'm only about halfway, but so far I like it. He rambles a bit, but it's well written, and I'm learning a lot of new words lol. His scene changes are so smooth that sometimes you don't even notice it. I look forward to the rest. The book is new, and came quickly.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was amazing. I could not stop crying at the end. This is a good book for kids 10 & up because it is kinda gory and there is a lot of deaths.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I hate that I need to write something it makes me not want to review anything. Next time I won't if this doesn't change
B00000I8UF|5.0|First of all, the CD was delivered in less than two days...yeah!<br />The music is wonderful, &#34;old school&#34; or not, this music is second to none.  These guys were so ahead of the times.  My only wish is that more people would recognize what truly gifted artist they are/were.
B00362DRN6|5.0|Excellent double CD for anyone who enjoys original DD and a must for us Duranies! Makes you want to get up and dance........ Fantastic 80's sound and excellent quality.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|As this book has been so highly publicized, I finally decided to read it. Unfortunately, I found that it did not quite live up to the hype.  Although the characters were well defined, they are typical male and female characters that we have seen in many stories.  Christian is the enormously wealthy, godlike attractive male and Ana is an innocent but feisty virgin who totally captures his heart.  The sex scenes although very well done and erotic become a little too much around the middle of the book.  Oh, if only sex was this earth shattering In real life. Without the sex scenes, there is very little story to this book. It is just too predictable.  I found it really disappointing and lacking.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Absolutely wonderful stuff... of the temple run genre... the minions are smashing as usual... my only issue that my kindle has crashed a few times while playing it...
B005JABSB6|5.0|I recently purchased a SHARP LC-60C8470U 60&#34; 3D TV. These glasses work perfectly with my system. They fit comfortably, including over-top my friend's glasses. I love how quickly they recharge too. I found the price to be fair in comparison to other glasses available for my TV - these were slightly cheaper :) and I have had no issues or complaints. Very happy. Highly recommend.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Tracks relative space time without distorting it thus making one less way to destroy the earth. I say that's a win.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This really makes me think and it gets harder every level. It is a great way to pass the time.
014241011X|2.0|This book really wasn't what I was looking for. If you are looking for a novel or story its ok but not what I had in mind.
B004R63MWQ|5.0|My kids all loved this movie. It was very captivating to them. Lots of fun action and intensity for them.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|One of my husband's favorite movies and  bought it as a surprise.  What the biggest surprise was that I ordered it Thursday evening and it was in my mailbox the very next day.  Movie night was a no brainer this weekend!
B0037DGH4A|5.0|This is an amazing work of musical art. Carlos santana shares his fame with other artists to create a true masterpiece,WOW! I listen to all types of music , still I find this is truly one of my favorite albums,I can listen to this album over&over / have been for years now,never seem to get tiered of it. A soul moving - feel good experience. hope youll love it to!  elmarlord
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Like a title says i never write reveiws or rate things but this book was so well writen it was great. The book was well writen and the topic was outstanding.  It drew me in and i was unable to stop reading it.  Now i'm just sad that it was done.  The references were well though out and placed as well.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Found game during an illness.  Helped passed time n lowered stress.  Great for kids and adults during long recoveries from illness or to pass time during treatments.
0316228583|1.0|Simply awful. This book only sold because of authors name. So sorry I payed for this book. It's about a bunch of complaining people, hateful people.
0805047905|5.0|All children will love this classic book from childhood on into adulthood.  It's so good to have something traditional that keeps it's emotional value over time.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|Fast paced- fun movie. It has good special effects and the story line keeps moving without leaving any gaps. Good end of days flick.
0064430170|5.0|A beloved child classic that I read to my kids - now for my grandson.  What a treat to return to.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|A refreshing difference from other match 3 games. Well worth the price. Outstanding graphics &amp; animation. Fun &amp; challenging game. Definitely recommended to all.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It's a love story but it's so beautifully written in some parts that it's almost like poetry. It's also very intelligent, it makes you think about life in ways you might not have before.
B0072GPPNC|5.0|Terrific story, and it's  movie that the entire family can enjoy. Loved it in the theater, and happy to own a copy now.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|ITS HELPS ME SEE HOW LONG I HAVE TO CHARGE IT OR PLAY GAMES AND ITS AWSOME CUZ IT LETS U SEE WAT APPS R STILL OPEN SO DOWNLOAD IT NOW WAT R U STILL HERE I SAID DOWNLOAD IT
B0064MGU98|4.0|Having only watched a few episodes, I am hooked on the wife who is thinking of her family. A struggle of political life and family pride.<br />We will see what happens...
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pe is the best game on the appstore . If your a minecraft fan then get this game .
B004VMVTNU|5.0|It has always done what it's supposed to do.  Fairly basic and has never failed me. I would recommend this to anyone who wants an alarm clock.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|im addicted to it. It would be more fun if the guy screamed when you wrecked. i enjoy this game
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I started to watch the program on TV and was confused but reading the book it is becoming clearer and I am enjoying both the book and the show
0525478817|5.0|First off, after having sixteen surgeries, and spending much of my early life in a hospital, and now being a healthy high school guy. I never thought I would want to read a book about two teens who were medically flawed, like I am, and emotionally, well, teenagery.  However John Green hits the nail smack dab on the head. I was not only impressed by his accuracy of medical terms and devices that I share in common, but his accurate reflection of the teenager. Not all teens are just trying to slide along in high school, some think deeply, into what life is, and what to appreciate. With the witty, and flawed characters of Hazel and Gus green crafts a beautiful novel out of a terrible disease, much like hazel and Gus craft beautiful lives out of a terrible situation. One of my favorite books.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Reacher  is always a winner and this book is no exception. If you aren't a fan this book will do the trick.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun and addictive game. My daily exercise. Lol. I don't normally play games, but I am totally addicted to MINIONS. Super fun! I only wish there were more coins offered.
B00DDXJRJG|1.0|It was free so I gave it try but I have uninstalled it.  Not sure what the problem was but it didn't work with my my Galaxy S3 & Google's music app where I have all my music stored.  It seemed to suppress the sound rather then enhance it.
0375805613|5.0|This was the &#34;board book&#34; version of the story, it was part of a babyshower gift and the small size was perfect.
B0076HNMU0|4.0|Remember when this was the talk of the water cooler?  Step back and revisit Twin Peaks. Tongue in cheek, it's a thriller-mystery with laughter. I missed most of this series the first time, but have enjoyed watching it and am really thrilled that I started my Prime membership.
B002361MLA|3.0|The book warns at the beginning that it is repetitive.  That was certainly the case for me, to the point where I simply couldn't spend any further time reading it beyond about a third of the way through.  What I did glean was interesting, but not for me.  It's worth checking out I believe, but do understand the author hammers the same points over and over again.
B003LZ5B7S|5.0|This was the first Doctor Who that I have ever watched. The first few episodes didn't really pull me in. Around the 5th episode I was hooked and I definitely wasn't ready for him to be replaced at the end. But I love David as the Doctor :)
B00CX7TOOG|1.0|Here's something plausible: take De Niro as a geriatric patient and make him an ex-Marine living in the woods sometime after the Bosnian War. Take Travolta looking in his mid-thirties and outfit him with the lamest \\"Serbian\\" accent you could possible imagine. Now send Johnny Travaltovitz on a mission to kill Travis Bickle Sr. with a bow and arrow. Now, before you mistake this story for the plot of the greatest comedy since Mel Brook's Blazing Saddles remember this is a \\"serious\\" film about war. For this reason the characters (who are constantly untying the knots holding them while the other character stands with his back to them reminiscing about the horrors of war) break into long, long meaningless soliliquies that would make Col. Kurtz in Apocolypse Now blush. Finally after several totally meaningless hours of knifing, stabbing, drinking, and telling stupid jokes the two give up, sit on a cliff edge, and call it a day. Bickle Sr. then goes to see his son and make nice nice, while Travoltovitz goes to a bar in Serbia, shoots down a shot of brandy, and stares meaninglessly into a misty mirror. The horror, the horror... P.S. The only good part was watching De Niro strung up by his bleeding leg. For this movie they should consider a similar treatment at the Academy Awards. Travolta can follow. P.S. If you've ever wanted to see De Niro piss on his own leg to heal a gaping wound this is your chance. You won't get another.
B00BEIYLAW|1.0|From the minute I saw the trailer I knew I wanted to see the film - and oh boy I wish that thought never crossed my mind. Bad acting, bad story. There is NOT one scene I liked. NEVER SEE THIS FILM. watch[[ASIN:B0009NSCS0 Pirates of Silicon Valley]] for a more accurate representation of Jobs
B00EL8JCGU|2.0|Not to be confused with the fantastic book \\"World War Z,\\" which it's \\"sourced\\" from. I can handle that the movie version of a book has to be altered/adapted for film, but Pitt went a made a different movie altogether -a rather generic zombie movie with a formulaic ending that has nothing in common with the source material.<br /><br />The main element of the book that is missing in this film is the morality/choices the world was forced to make in order to save itself from an unstoppable zombie invasion - i.e. - no magic solution as is presented in the movie.  It would have been way more exciting to see Pitt running around the world advocating for or against policies being enacted by governments around the world- Redeker plan anyone?<br /><br />A real shame - such a cool book reduced to a generic film (and I am a HUGE Brad Pitt fan, so double whammy).
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Just started watching it after hearing everybody talk about it.Good show I would surely recommend it.Wee need more shows like this to keep people interested.

B00BMNM4H6|3.0|This game is very simple in concept - draw lines to get grains of sugar to fall from the top of the screen and land in coffee cups. However, after getting only a few screens in, it does get very challenging. There is not a lot of exciting graphics and the music is only a recent update. It is a basic game - nothing terrible, but nothing exciting either. It is a good time waster.<br /><br />What several people have commented on already, though, is the fact it is available on computers for free at coolmath.com. I understand this is a different format, so there may need to be a price above free, but it may irritate some that a free game on one site is not free on an Android device.<br /><br />Overall, it is fun for a while but gets a bit hard to play after a few levels. It can be a good time waster, though, especially in the sandbox mode. then, you get to draw any shape and it can be fun to watch the crystals move around swirls and other shapes. If you get this as a free app of the day, it is a fun download.

B000HWZ5WE|5.0|When this album, yes album, first came out, I remember playing it often. Such a different take and style than what is out there. Had not heard this in many years. Played the CD in my car on the way home and sat in the driveway waiting for a song to finish. My 17 year old neighbor asked who that was. He had never heard this type of music. Now he is hooked and bought a copy. If you are not familiar and looking for something a little different, give this one a shot.

B00AZMFJYA|1.0|The plot and backstory of this movie deviate so much from the orginal series and all the other star trek movies and series that I absolutely hated it.  Yeah, it's PRETTY but after a while that Enterprise bridge looks like a 1990's version of a 1950's diner --what with all the white surfaces and colored lights.  And the uniforms, I counted at least five different styles --including that Star Wars, pseudo Nazi, uniform worn by those at Starfleet. Geez! And the &#34;lens flares&#34; (you know the light streaks from the lights as the camera moved), someone must really like those because they appeared so much I felt as if I should be wearing sunglasses.  It looked so bright on that set, in fact, I'm surprised the actors were not wearing sunglasses themselves.  In addition, what was up with the lower portion insides of the Enterprise looking like the lower insides of the Titanic?  I bet someone used old photos of the engine room of the Titanic to design the set of this movie.  And, what about the personality of Captain Kirk?  He acted so reckless and immature, I wouldn't loan him my car much less let him captain a ship.  The original Kirk could sleep around, flirt, drink a little, but he acted like a grown man, not a high school senior just experiencing sex and alcohol for the first time.  I think it is cool how the producers were able to match contempory actors with those of the original series, but after a while I thought I was watching Saturday Night Live caricatures.  I felt that through much of the movie the editors had run the voice sound tracks through a digital filter to make the actors sound more like their counterparts of the original series.  Moreover, one of the hallmarks of the Star Trek series and movies has always been a certain grounding in the physics of reality -- not with this movie.  That is you would never have seen someone jumping the equivalent of six stories to a fast moving vehicle.  (You know, it only takes a two story drop to kill or severly mame someone.)  The movie felt at times as if it were one of those overdone action movies in which the directors like computer gernerated effects so much, they don't care how cartoonish their movie appears.  Finally, I liked the first movie using these actors that was made a couple of years ago, but I REALLY REALLY CANNOT RECOMMEND this movie... especially at what is being currently charged.
B00C1UEYYK|4.0|I adore this series but the disks for season 2 have flaws. There are white lines at the top of the screen in every episode except 2 & 5. Amazon has sent me three sets with the same flaws. I will continue to exchange them until Amazon sends me a non-defective set.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|This game appears simple, but it isn't as easy as you'd think when you progress to the higher levels.  I would suggest using a stylus for more precision drawing.<br /><br />Adequate instructions, pleasant music that you can turn off if desired, cute if simplistic graphics.  Plays very well on my Kindle HD Fire 8.9.<br /><br />Worth a buck to me, it's a good time waster.

B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Now you see me(released May/13)stars,among others,Jesse Eisenberg,Mark Ruffalo,Woody Harrelson,M&eacute;lanie Laurent,Isla Fisher,Dave Franco Common,Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman.This is a dazzling puzzler of a film with a plethora of plot twists and sleight of hand,designed to not only fool the characters on screen but we the audience also.The film reunites stars Eisenberg and Harrelson,since their first collaboration in Zombieland.<br />The story finds four single act magicians,one who specializes in lock picking,bending spoons,etc,the other a mentalist,the other a card trick master and lastly an escape artiste.They one day all get a special card telling them to meet at an apartment.Inside they are given instructions by remote,and a year later they are all in Vegas doing a joint act;now known as the Four Horsemen.In Vegas they \\"pick\\" out a visiting Frenchman from the vast audience and have him \\"rob\\" his personal bank in Paris,through \\"teleportation\\".After the show the bank in Paris has indeed been robbed and the four are arrested by the FBI.Without just cause and total lack of connection,the foursome are let go.We are introduced to a debunker who has been following the four and wants to expose them and will follow them to the end.<br />The next big trick is in New Orleans.This time they have their benefactor/backer on stage with them.As they have each member of the audience check their bank accounts,the audience finds theirs going up while the funds are coming out of their benefactors account,much to his chagrin.After the show their mentor,who is now seeing red,finds the debunker and puts him on the payroll to expose them.<br />The groups last big trick is in New York where there is a safe loaded with multi millions of dollars.Through their usual means,the group manages to spirit the safe away right from under the FBI noses.After all is said and done the FBI investigator who has been so far behind this group arrests the debunker.The debunker never saw it coming,neither did we,that the lead FBI man was somehow behind it all.<br />Meanwhile the four have appeared in Central Park at a tree containing a card left behind by a long dead magician called Shrike.The four put their original cards together,which activates the card in the tree,which in turn starts a nearby carousel moving.In front of the carousel is the FBI agent,who welcomes them to the \\"eye\\" .They all board the carousel and \\"disappear\\".Time passes and a French Interpol agent who was working with the FBI agent on the case from the start,is sitting on a bench on a bridge in Paris,when the agent appears.It is learned he is the son of the long dead magician.Along with revenge on the debunker who humiliated his father,he got revenge on the company that produced the sub par steel in the safe his father drowned in,and the bank and the benefactor of the Horsemen who originally refused to pay on the insurance claim.Fade out.<br />The film itself resembles a magic act before your eyes,as deception after deception is played out by multiple characters and we,like the audience in the film,are often fooled and amazed.Some of the tricks are explained and others are not(hey there are some secrets that are sacred after all).When it all comes down to the end of the film,like Harrelson's charcater says\\"I didn't see that coming\\".All the actors do a tremendous job together and obviously had some fun doing this film.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a featurette and commentary.<br />All in all a nicely done who done it,wrapped in the guise of a huge magic act,with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing right to the end.A solid four stars,and maybe a little more.er did we,that the lead FBI man was somehow behind it all.<br />Meanwhile the four have appeared in Central Park at a tree containing a card left behind

B003H4I4JU|3.0|Its just not as good as enders game. It feels a lot like the characters watch themselves take actions without having any influence on them. This gives the book a feel of a speculative experiment rather than an absorbing story.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I was not expecting much from this film, at best maybe a generic comic book movie.  Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />Dredd is a violent, fast paced action / sci-fi movie with great acting and visual effects.  I have not read the comics so this is my only exposure to the series other than the hokey flick from the 90's.  This new version is far grittier, and I really enjoyed the whole film.<br /><br />Between the scenes of nudity, drug use and gore this film is NOT FOR KIDS.  You've been warned.  However, adults who have even a passing fancy for this genre should not pass this one up.
B003G4W49C|5.0|What a complex character. Dealing with the fears and frustrations that we all go through as children, but at an accelerated rate, and in Space. Very cool
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like Minecraft, I love this game, and even though it cost $7, you can basically do whatever you want. (Not anything, lol, but most things) From a tall skyscraper, to a small town house. There are two modes, Survival, which you...survive, and Creative, which you...Create. Don't hesitate to get this AWESOME game. I am a total MINECRAFTER! P.S. Watch out for the Creepers. Ssssssssssss......BOOM!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Now that I've read all three books, I can honestly say...thank God. Poorly written, and very redundant. Did the author not read the first book before she wrote the third?  After being kissed by Christian, she admitted to herself and to him that she'd never been kissed. Ever. Third book names two make out buddies. C'mon people!! Get past all the sex scenes and seriously look at how this story is written. It's a bastard child of the Twilight series and J.D. Robb's \\"In Death\\" series.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What a great book!  So glad I read it.  It kept me wondering what would happen the entire book.  It was great!
B006SV2LWA|4.0|It is very interesting to see how they solve this mystery.  We love these kinds of movies.  Scary to think this could actually happen in real life.  Good movie.
B00B8YSIMY|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The story was incredibly well written and very very interesting. Having said that the 'character' James was infuriating, but then he is and addict and to be honest that is pretty much realistic I think.  To say the guy has no backbone is an understatement and the things he gets up to because he seems incapable of saying no is laughable. But again, he is an addict and so this fits the whole persona of an addict. I read this book in a couple of days simply because when I was home I wanted to read it.<br />The only bit I wasn't too keen on was the ending. I don't want to spoil it but it seemed like it cut off when it could have gone on longer.  It would have been nice to discover whether James' plans worked and if he recovered. It certainly ends on a cliff hanger and a slightly amusing one, but given the nature of the book, it would have been nice to see how things panned out for him.<br />Certainly recommend this book, but if you don't like bad language and violence and drug use then this really isn't for you.
B0055OK2T0|4.0|Love it!!!!! When challenge has come, face it. This movie helps me to think about what I have been through all these years. Matt Damon is always the best actor.  Movie is quite impressive.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am glad the kindle version is up to date. This game is awesomely addictive. I recommend everyone to try it out.

B005T87QCI|2.0|The game is fun and my kids enjoy it but the initial game cost .99 and none of the robots the kids want to play are included so I shelled out another 8.99 for a 10 pack of robots. Still an ok game but what really irritates me is after having spent 10.00 for a game it STILL isn't ad free. So not cool. Not to mention the black screen that makes you have to uninstall and reinstall the game to get it to work again. :(
0345525558|5.0|Regardless of growing up in the foster care system, the main character finally learns to feel and trust love. This is a great story about her growth and discovery, and it gave me a lot of insight and empathy for children of the foster care system. I loved learning about the meanings of many flowers along the way!

0807014273|5.0|This is one of the best examples of using circumstances to search for the strengths within each of us. And to use them to get through life situations that we never expected nor wanted.

B000007MVD|5.0|On a quality basis, most of the Beatles' original tunes on this album are superior to the covers (with the exception, possibly, of the Chuck Berry numbers). But it's the covers I love here. That's partly because of the Beatles' earnest and enthusiastic live performances - which capture the band's sound when they were still young and hungry - and partly because the group just plain had good taste. It's fascinating to hear the variety of influences the Beatles absorbed, and anyone who's interested in learning how they became the group we know and admire should acquire this disc.<br /><br />From basic rhythm-and-blues to country-western to straight rock n' roll to American musical to Chuck Berry to Carole King - this album has the Beatles doing it all, and I've discovered a lot of great songs here I never would have heard otherwise. Some of the best of these unknowns are \\"Soldier of Love,\\" \\"The Honeymoon Song,\\" \\"Sure to Fall,\\" and \\"Lonesome Tears in My Eyes.\\" The Beatles also triumph on a number of 1950s rock classics we know and love, including some by Chuck Berry (\\"Carol,\\" \\"Too Much Monkey Business,\\" \\"Sweet Little Sixteen,\\" \\"Memphis),\\" all of which are sung with gusto by John; as well as one made famous by Elvis (\\"That's All Right (Mama),\\" which is belted out expertly by Paul.<br /><br />The disc also punches holes in the old argument that John was the hard rocker and Paul was the balladeer. When you listen to Paul's rocking performances on \\"Clarabella\\" or \\"That's All Right (Mama)\\" or to John sweetly croon \\"To Know Her Is To Love Her,\\" the stereotypes die. Of course, Paul is in his element with some of the ballads, like \\"The Honeymoon Song\\" and John can rock as well as anyone on tracks like \\"Too Much Monkey Business\\" and \\"I Got a Woman.\\" George also has some good moments - particularly on \\"Young Blood,\\" a country-influenced number with hilarious background vocals by Paul and John. The singing and playing by all four members is excellent throughout, although the sound quality isn't always top-notch. The performances are all live, punching holes in another old stereotype that the Beatles weren't a talented live band. I challenge anyone to listen to this and then try to make that argument.<br /><br />To sum it up, when I want to hear the Beatles' original songs at their finest, I go straight to their official releases, not this one. But when I want to hear what they must have sounded like doing covers of their favorite songs at the Cavern Club in 1962 or 1963, I put on the BBC disc. Even after nearly 20 years, it's still rewarding (and the Beatles' silly banter with the radio host never fails to charm). It's a must-have for any Beatles fan.quality isn't always top-notch.

140006922X|5.0|A couple friends of mine sugessted this book.  The book calls into question if Jesus is truly the chosen one.  There were many messiahs during that time.  And this book raises some good questions.  The writers of the Bible had no idea that therer would be a day of researching history like we do today.  This would be a great book to go with a Bible study.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|What a unique twist on Hitler's story.  As a German America I have always been fascinated with Adolf Hitler and how he came into power and how he went bat crap crazy with it.  This story is a great twist on the end of World War II and the Hitler story.  I know the assignment was to save Hitler but I don't think I could have gone through with it.  Did our agent go through with it?  Read this book today and find out.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Whether you have a few DVDs or an amazing collection, the set you have has a big hole in it if you do not own<br />THE KING'S SPEECH.  This is one of the few DVDs that are more than entertainment, or thrills, or even simply insightful.<br />THE KING'S SPEECH is absolutely necessary in your collection for you to watch many more times than just once.<br />It is an experience that forces you to realize on a very personal level the depth of feeling, of fear and courage, and sheer<br />tenacity that it took for the British as a people and as individuals in the face of World War II.  The actors chosen to create<br />THE KING'S SPEECH are each and every one of them exactly right.  Many of them were Oscar nominees and one received<br />the honor.  To my mind, two should have shared one for best actor.  Even Mr. Wood, whom you will miss if you blink, is a<br />Shakespearian actor of great talent. Don't blink.  Buy THE KING'S SPEECH.

B00D23GXB2|5.0|When you hear that someone goes by the pen name \\"Greatest Poet Alive\\" and titles his book \\"Revenge of the Orgasm\\" you know you will have to read it.  You just have to.  And I did.  This is a collection of sexy poems, totally approximately 60 pages.<br />G.P.A.  manages to write sensual and erotic poetry with elegant yet complex prose.  I think he covered just about every possible scenario in his collection.  He claims they are based on his own experiences, I say we should all have experiences like that.  His range varies from the sensual act of bathing one's partner's feet to blatant obsession.  But each piece is elegantly and perfectly written.<br />Some of these are not for the faint of heart and I applaud his bravery.  He covers everything from dominance/submission to exhibitionism and voyeurism.  But his writings are sexy and sensual, not trashy. If I had to select one as my favorite it would have to be Westin Incident.  Without giving too much away it's the story of passionate sex in a hotel room, the window and curtain being left open just enough for someone to see and hear.  After catching a glimpse of another couple across the parking lot also lost in the thralls of frantic lovemaking for a moment two couples become one.<br />Every person will find something in one of these poems, something that they secretly say, yes I wish I could do that.<br />This book of short poems should be everyone's erotic fantasy checklist!  I dare you to experience the fantasy of even just one of these stories.
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|A cute little app for a younger child to be able to identify the problem and find a resolution with no frustration. Just a pure fun game for a younger child.
B00F2ZL8H2|5.0|Why Newly Born Babies Can't Talk is a skill fully written short story that explains how babies were once born able to speak until a curse was placed on one baby and all that followed that they would be able to until they were older.  It is a wonderfully written piece of folk lore! Why the tortoise is Bald - Is an amusing story.  A very entertaining piece that I enjoyed reading! Why Pigs are Attracted to Refuse Dumps - Is a wonderful, crafty fairy tale with its own subtle moral lesson.<br />Each of these was a pleasure to read and should be shared with children as bed time stories!
B004TI5N38|5.0|Love, love, love anything I have ever read by him! Bring on more David Baldacci books and I will definitely purchase!
B00063EMJ6|5.0|I have always liked Neil Youngs' singing. I bought this to replace the one I have. Highly recommend this cd.
B00F35BV64|5.0|We loved the movie.  The streaming was awesome.  Like the new suits that allow you to swim in space.  Great CGI but my son says that going back before Star Trek the tv show was a bit confusing.
B005IEGUDY|5.0|If you have 22 or so hours to spend in historic England, this is the book for you.  Sometimes the names don't quite make the connection between the epics because the cast is so large.  Should probably be read a second time.
B004X6PRO6|2.0|I gave two stars because the narrative is painfully familiar to me, since I was born in the former Soviet Union.  All the torture-shmorture gore is so boring, so deja vu, so second-hand.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|It is not going to be the series that you fall completely in love with, but you will enjoy it and be anxious to see how it all turns out.
B00B0X4PIO|2.0|although the story came together at the end Ifound the different chapters and characters a little confusing and hard to follow  khaled`s previous two books were much better a thousand splendid suns I would give 5 stars
B001ANSSDC|2.0|I did not enjoy this book at all. It was really weird to be completely honest. Don't see why anyone wanted to make it a movie.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have been using Evernote for a little more than a year now and I would be completely lost now, if it were  not around.  Now that I have  used it and am familiar w/all of the features, I am completely dependent on Evernote.  I have scanner pro on my iPhone and I have enabled saving to evernote in the settings.  I scan all of my important documents and they show up in their own notebook &quot;scanner pro&quot; by default. You can then move them to whichever notebook you prefer.  The two apps compliment each other very well. I always have everything I need on my phone or tablet, on  of the two is always with me!!! In a recent update, reminders was  added.  This is great, I can make a note of an important event coming up &amp; set a reminder so I don't forget. I am constantly using Evernote at work and uploading attachments is simple or saving emails...you can also email stuff directly to an evernote notebook!  This turkey is a very addictive app. Once you get familiar w/all that it can do for you, you will find yourself referencing evernote on a regular basis. I have completely done away w/sticky notes. There's no need for paper and pencil when your phone is always with you anyways. I can grab my phone, enter a quick note and it is instantly available on my tablet or laptop or any other device I have evernote on. You can also log into evernote via the web.  With every update that is released evernote just gets so much better an  is always reliable. Keep up the good work evernote team!!!
0062017926|5.0|I enjoy James Rollins' Sigma Force novels and Amazon provided a quick and efficient means of securing several titles that weren't available in local book stores.  As a &#34;Prime&#34; member, I got my novels in just 2 days.  I'm a happy camper!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Prior to buying this mouse I used multiple razor mice and didn't find them to be half as appealing. Everything on this mouse is top quality from the mouse body, to the braided cord. Buttons are fluid which is great for quick use, but I could see some users accidentally hitting the side buttons. Also this mouse is meant for right handed people so if you play with your left just be warned.<br /><br />This mouse is also significantly larger than the image portrays it to be. Be warned if you have small hands, but it's great for those of us with larger hands. The weights that come a long with the mouse provide a decent weight, and provided for a smoother glide in my case.<br /><br />Last major note I would give is that the drivers for this mouse is meant for PC. So if you plan on using this mouse on a mac you won't have access to the side buttons, and some of the other options available to this mouse provided by the drivers.<br /><br />Final thoughts: This is an amazing mouse for the price that your paying. The multiple dpi is great if you play a multitude of games or simply want increased accuracy. Definitely pick it up if your looking for a good weighted mouse.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|finally a great game with beautiful graphics the music is soothing and fun interaction with characters would love more games like this that are challenging.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I expected this book to be a bit melodramatic or to be very funny (based upon &#34;What Alice Forgot.&#34; ) While there was a bit of humor, the drama in the story was very realistic and moving. The characters are compelling and consistent and their evolution very believable. The book was moving and engrossing to the very last page.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|Busy enough to entertain, complex enough to engage a 6 year old for hours or simple enough for a 3 year old. Colorful, no violence at all, constructive learning.  Moms and grandmothers think it's pretty entertaining, too.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|Awesome game with a simple concept but can be very challenging. Just as much fun as factory balls. Thanks Bart Bonte for a wonderful app.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I'm still fond of the older version but this app works well once you get used to the new layout.
B000WBZZB6|1.0|We ordered this movie so we could watch it on July 4th only to find out that it is coded for European DVD players and cannot be played on our machine. It was not advertised as such, and was purchased from Ohio! I would not buy another DVD from this seller because obviously they have no idea what is leaving their warehouse.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Great  stuff  fun maybe add beer vision would be awesome and a  chugging contest Hahaha  that would be a fun game but all and all a  relatively good game
B003G4W49C|5.0|I know, I know, everybody loves Ender's Game. Well, me too. I liked the characters and I like the story.
B00DDU1T5E|2.0|We bought this app for  a long plane ride, but it would keep quitting immediately after it starts. Very disappointing.
1439152802|5.0|Was not the ending I expected.  Very well written book, and I'll probably hunt up more books by this author.  .
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great with YouTube and Netflix...can't wait for what is to come as far as additional partnerships!  Streaming from Google Chrome is not entirely smooth.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This cover looks great and functions wonderfully. It really protects my Kindle Fire and even has a small sleeve I can fold a piece of paper up and slide in if need be.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a really enjoyable game.  The maps and levels are are different and challenging.  It is very responsive on the kindle.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This weather app is so different than most others--I love the way it is presented in a circular shape instead of a side by side format, and it has more information than I even know what to do with. It's also very aesthetically pleasing, and I like the way the clouds, rain, etc. looks.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|Dredd holds up very well against the comic books, and Urban plays Judge Dredd perfectly! So much better than that Stallone movie
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Even though this is listed for young adults, I think anyone would enjoy it. I enjoyed it and I'm 75yrs.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Never a dull moment.  Great cast, great stories, lots of action, and lots of Harley riding.  Dramatic yet heart warming.
B000RH0C8G|1.0|I only made it 12% thru (on kindle) before i completely gave up. no character development, no real plot, some very poor sentence construction. So, I don't know much about baseball, and i read more science fiction that any other genre, but the book simply frustrated me with such terrible writing; i gave the author the benefit of the doubt for as long as i could, thinking the pace would pick up and the plot would be revealed with better style. Friends have told me they had enjoyed the author's other books - good on them, but I'm not interested enough to venture again. I don't usually offer any reviews or comments, but you asked for a review....<br /><br />Now, where is my Iain Banks...
B0009XRZ9M|5.0|My grandson thinks this is the greatest Christmas movie ever!!  He especially like the hot chocolate song.  I too enjoy watching it especially with him.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|Great idea for a game, but it didn't work on the Kindle Fire. I think if they came out with an updated version there could be potential here, as I know lots of little girls who love My Little Pony. Can't complain too much it was free. :)
B000JQU1VS|1.0|I ordered this book a very long time ago and am still waiting for the problems to be resolved.  I do not know what the problem is but I should have been notified of this problem many moons ago!
B00EDF43MY|5.0|What a great little app! It was free, and my little sister has alot of fun playing this. I haven't had any problems on the Kindle Fire. The sound, characters, and theme of the game are interesting for little ones. She loves to &#34;wash&#34; the airplane and get stamps as a reward. :)
0064471837|5.0|An amazingly original story with great characters.  Sabriel is definitely one of my all time favorite heroines!  Garth Nix writes with clarity and creates a breathtaking world that is easy to become a part of.  Love, love, love this trilogy.
B008QMMEOE|4.0|This is fun for a free app. It is very simple. Little kids have to use problem solving skills and get a cute reward when they've solved the puzzle. The free version starts out with four puzzles, and if you want more, you must buy the full version. I caved and bought the full version at 1.99...which isn't really bad considering how much REAL puzzles cost.
1741791529|5.0|I'm Iranian and travel to my home every couple of years.  We always get the latest Lonely Planet Guide to Iran before we go and appreciate all the up to date information.  My family in Iran likes to look at it as well and sometimes they discover a place to visit that they did not know about before!  Traveling is one of the best ways to bring peace to the world and the Lonely Planet Guides allow people to travel with knowledge and confidence.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This, like all of the other Disney apps, is fun, entertaining, and humurous. My younger sister and I laugh at Perry and the Evil scientist. Haven't had any problems playing this on my Kindle Fire. And it was FREE!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game keeps me coming back. I like how I don't spend too much time at one sitting, so I can get other things done.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is one of the best I've used for the Kindle Fire. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about it, except that, as all Pinterest users must know, it's addicting. Great app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It was amazing I play it all the time and its Evan more fun if you have facebook buy it!!!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|fantastic end to a great series. I bought it for my kindle and have barely been able to put it down since
B00B4RP0OO|4.0|Great program, but can only play videos from one specific folder. Easy dowload, install and simple interface for playing many forrmats.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Fun and easy game with cute graphics and would be suitable for all ages.  It,s free and very easy to learn.
B00190OHD6|5.0|This has the sad moments, happy moments and everything like that. It is a different twist to it but I LOVE IT!!!
B000VUCIZO|3.0|Good book to see othr point ov view camparing to S. Jobs biography. However it is not the best position if You're not interested in technical (electronic) side of Apple's history.
0143145088|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn and grow, or to those interested in the social sciences.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I must say, very impressed. Shows a level of intelligence to capture<br />Someone's attention as well as you did here in this game.<br />I do like this little trial run and will recommend it at my Facebook site.<br />Story line fits well, good movement, smooth.<br />Graphic's are very nicely done.<br />Pricing though, with this economy? Not too sure.<br />All my best!<br />A gaming fan!
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Love this game.  I find it addicting in the best way.  Keeps me coming back for more. It is just the type of game I enjoy playing on my Kindle.  Thumbs up!!!
B003EEMIV8|5.0|Very nice and LARGE, with plenty of room to stuff crumpled recycled papers, rubberbands, cut straws and other toys. :D
1423101499|5.0|This series kept me on my toes..  But I do wish that it didn't have to end..  It was great with all the twists and turns..
B007A4SDCG|4.0|The book was a fun read, told the same old stories but in a easy flowing lingo<br />The book at times is too short but the impact is there<br />Will recommend to persons who want to fight laziness but in a tangential manner
B00006DEFA|4.0|From a filmic point it is great<br />Mocking too much does not satisfied me<br />But it does not go far from the common viewers<br />But I love it<br />Anyway...
B003VANOFY|5.0|So this headset is amazing. I love the voicing features. But the sound quality is very good. You do have to tinker a bit with the options and the sound levels too. Once you find what your ears respond to though, the quality for gaming is amazing. I've killed so many people on League of Legends thanks to this lol.
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|Not worth a watch. Not much of an action flick either and some of the graphics appear cheesy and almost video game-ish..
B00AFPTSI0|4.0|I will make this review brief as others have said what I have to say about this book more eloquently. My only criticism is that  sometimes it seems like the author is cherry picking some examples which serve the purpose of his views. The thing with science is that you should also present the evidence that rejects your views. I think I would have appreciated to see more of these.<br /><br />But on a more humanitarian view, regardless of the science behind this, I agree with the overall message. Giving is better.
B00EL8JCGU|4.0|Non stop action, no unnecessary blood, and good story.  Brad was calm and yet determined.  Good all around.  Watched with my kids,  10 &  12.
B00004YTXH|5.0|I enjoyed listening to the vivacious song, Chi Mai, on the easy listening music channel on TV. Lo and Behold, when I bought this awesome CD, there on the #4 track, was Chi Mai. A very lovely musical piece to start your day.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I like the romance that is written in the crossfire novels. I have read two of these books and hope there are more to come
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|This is a fun game however after your shark gets dead! It takes to long to start it up again I usually just turn it off
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I always enjoyed watching the minions, now I get to play one. I am going to buy this game. It looks so easy, but it is hard to coordinate the right finger movements sometimes.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Like being in a novel. Really feel for all characters and the grandma is really special. Funny,tough but kind underneath her tough outside.  Can't wait til next season although not happy with how season ended!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|My mom and i rented this movie from red box. It is weird and very hard to follow. I am glad i paid about a dollar for this movie. I do not recommend this movie to anyone
B002S8AGZG|5.0|This DVD was rcvd as listed very quickly. I have been wanting this movie on DVD for awhile now. Thank you!
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I usually love this sort of book - lots of action, a little magic. I found  the writing to be repetitive and derivative. Dialogue was sparse.  The story was not internally consistent, like it was written in bits and mashed together without editing. Many editing errors,too, grammar and misspellings. This is the first book I have read by this author, and probably the last.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Some of this was predictable, but overall was just average. I think the storyline could have been more developed. This movie could have been more epic.
140006922X|4.0|Anyone that thinks this book is in the least bit controversial hasn't read five words of reputable historical scholarship on Jesus of Nazareth written in the last 100 years. Based on other works of historical criticism I've read, I very much doubt there's anything in Zealot that would cause a current New Testament scholar to so much as raise an eyebrow. The sole 'controversy' here is Reza Aslan's contention that the historical evidence supports Jesus of Nazareth having been a Jewish zealot, while a slim majority of scholars to take the view he was a Jewish apocalypticist. Since the majority of works I've read take the apocalypticist perspective, it was interesting to look at Aslan's presentation of the evidence in favor of 'Jesus as zealot' (and Aslan is far from being the only proponent of this view). Seriously, THIS is what makes Reza Aslan the new Salman Rushdie? The difference between first-century Jewish zealotry and first-century Jewish apocalypticism? Oh the horror! Miley Cyrus will bring down Christianity before Zealot will.<br /><br />Overall, Zealot is well-grounded in current, reputable scholarship from respected NT scholars, as can be seen from the extensive bibliography Aslan cites. Virtually every piece of evidence he brings up I've read before from other scholars; he simply takes a different but equally-supportable view of the evidence to weave a slightly different view of Jesus of Nazareth. In the process, however, he paints a more rich and interesting picture of first century Galilee and Roman Judea (collectively 'Palestine') than I've seen in other works. For me this was the real strength of Zealot and something other scholarly authors have not done nearly so well as Aslan.<br /><br />I do have a few minor quibbles though. I think Aslan's writing style is a bit too novelized. He clearly wanted to make Zealot exciting, but sometimes his style tends more towards Dan Brown than I personally like in a book of popular scholarship. And there are definitely cases where he's wrong on his facts. They're all minor, but in an otherwise well-researched book they do stand out. Examples: he says Greek was the lingua franca of the Roman Empire. In reality Greek filled that role only in the eastern part; in the west it was Latin. He says Pontius Pilate had authority over \\"the legions\\" in Judea, but there were no legions based there while Pilate was prefect. Finally, Aslan presents some legendary aspects of Pilate's life as historical -- e.g., the belief he dies in exile in Gaul is legendary and dates from centuries after Pilate lived. Maybe it happened, maybe it didn't. I don't fault Aslan using legendary material, I just wish he'd made a clear distinction when he did.<br /><br />Overall, a good read and well worth the time (especially for the view of first century Palestine), but if you're looking for paradigm-shattering controversy, this isn't the book that's going to give it to you.
B000SNW0HA|5.0|good to listen to any time. I listen to it all the time. I don't need anything more, don't need no go, don't need no moe
B0055D3EFU|4.0|First half of the movie is fairly captivating, and it seems to be a tip of the hat to good, old fashioned scary movies.  The plot line for the second half feels rushed, like the writers simply ran out of steam. Towards the end it gets goofy, but overall a good enough movie.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I like to read Ken Follets' spy novels. He is a very good writer. Background is good and he keeps me in supence.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've sat in many recording studios and mixed/mastered on a variety of speakers and using a variety of headphones for reference.  I'm not a \\"professional\\" but I've interned and later worked at a studio and had bands that recorded at different studios as well.  I've been able to get great results but sometimes lackluster results due to the variables envolved in any studio - equipment, room acoustics, placement, influences of others, etc.  With that background in mind, here's what I've found:  These headphones are revealing, and they are not \\"warm\\" or \\"full\\".  They have helped me to spot trouble areas in mixes that I've missed in the studio monitors, and to make the minute adjustments that bring balance to a mix.  They are clear without being overly \\"crisp\\", and the low end is detailed instead of trying to be \\"boomy\\" like so many consumer-grade units. In fact the entire range is detailed.  I've read of some folks wanting to break them in, but I've not had a need for that.  They were great right out of the box, and I hope they never change!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Homeland is a great show you will like, if you like action, intrigue, and suspense, coupled with good acting. A good premise, fast-paced, gripping action and compelling plots. Great cast, 1st season is best (2nd season kind of drops the ball...). Really like the suspense and acting and this is the 2000th review!
B002ZG99TK|5.0|If you're into locomotives, you'll love this video.  The side stories are touching and the video is non-stop excitement. My only negative comment would be the three helicopters being in too many scenes and flying too low.
B003R0LBVW|4.0|i struggle with Franzen as a novelist - however having read most of his books I continue because he manages to capture your emotions and you move with them. As a reader you become so engrossed with the characters that you forget it is not real.  great read but be ready to have your emotions go all over the place.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love this app!! LOVE that I can wake up to my own music!! It's just perfect for waking up too plus the clock features are FUN!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love it and I can't stop playing it but I really want the endor update BUT I can't get it
1607066017|5.0|Brian K. Vaughan is truly writing an epic. He accomplishes a huge scale while maintaining a very personal tale. This is a must read.
B000002HJR|5.0|These guys just keep getting better every Cd that comes out is the s*** and I love them!!! They RULE
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|You can't go wrong with this boxed set if you're a Sound of Music fan.<br />This has it all, and many extras.  I bought it for a gift, and hear thank you all time, still.
B0093H8HXS|5.0|i gotta say im really happy with this Cpu ! windows sees this as a Quad core ! Hyper threading ! it is locked .. so you cant overclock it i think. but idc really. really fast processor. i used to have a intel pentium Cpu. and that was slow. now everything runs fast with this Cpu. !
B0025KVLSI|5.0|Our old albums are remastered now and on this CD.  You can't go wrong with the quality and price.  Extras, also.
1401938906|2.0|I'm enjoying the content of the book, at the same time, none of the experiments have worked for me, which is a little disappointing.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|One of the best books I have read for a long time. He was always in right place at the right time
B00BM7ORFO|3.0|A quick read which doesn't stretch the mind a great deal.  A good holiday pick if you are looking for something light.
B005LAII12|2.0|Had some funny moments but overall just another romantic comedy.  I was hoping for alot when I heard about this flick and I was very dissapointed after seeing it, kind of a waste of time.  I didn't mind the swaring or jokes I don't know why so many reviewers complained about the jokes and sex it's says R on the cover for a reason duh...it was a jumbled together yawnfest with little storyline.  Pass.
B004U8VWIM|1.0|Just not my kind of movie. Sloppy story, corny production and direction. Less than original writing and ultately not entertaining.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great TV show, can not wait for more episodes. Also awesome that it is on amazon prime free to watch
0312330537|4.0|great word pictures.  one of the best books I have read.  it is worth the time, a very big book.
B000NY12CI|4.0|Excellent as autobiography. I found the last part, when she dealt with her political views and also the political chicanery that she lived through, to be too long and definitely not as powerful. But the first 90% of the book was totally gripping.
B0085TJUGI|5.0|this  book  is a  spiritually  perceptive  game  changer.  it  was  totally  synchronous  with  my  path.  bought  copies  for  my  best  friends.  Truly  amazing  story  and  .expression  of  it.  well  continue  tho  re-read.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|It is a fun game to play if you like strategy games or want something to do in your spare time.
B00F35BV64|3.0|The plot was engaging for a fantastic sci-fi, but it had too much language in it.  They didn't have to make Kirk such a playboy, either.  Nobody can replace the original cast, but Scotty was a fun character.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I liked that he left you with vivid images of his first person experience.  Something most of us will never experience.  Sometimes his ego is out in the middle of the street and a bit creepy, but it doesn't stop you from turning page after page.  His super over the top love of America and duty to country B.S. is a bit annoying at times and seemingly unrealistic, but I guess that was him.  Still a great read.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I was playing temple run when I found this version, which I like much better.  Except the monster gets in my way when I stumble and he gets too close.
1596177373|4.0|The deck comes with hand drawn characters that are taken from Burton's book \\"The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy and Other stories.\\"<br /><br />Joker One - Robot Boy<br />Joker Two - Voodoo Girl<br />Jack - Roy the Toxic Boy<br />Queen - Pin Cushion Queen<br />King - Mummy Boy<br />Ace - Stain Boy<br /><br />All of the pips are original and hand drawn as well as the indices both have an \\"eerie\\" feel to them.<br /><br />The Back design is like the tuck box - red and white stripes with the skull and crossbones (one way back design). The Tim Burton playing cards are released from Dark Horse comics and Tim Burton publishing - however the cards are manufactured in China, so these are not going to be \\"sturdy\\" USPCC cards that we're used to in the states. These are \\"novelty\\" or \\"collectors\\" cards.<br /><br />Good if you're a card collector or a Burton fan.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|This little beauty can be apply to other application other than gaming.  The software included is relatively easy to use and set up was as simple as it gets.  I personally use it for 3DS Max.
B000I8HIR2|4.0|The look and feel kept close to the original video game.  Creepy with great set pieces and fun special effects.
B007HACDLK|5.0|What a read!  Rest in peace, Vince Flynn - you done good!  I will sorely miss Mitch Rapp.  Hope the publishers release #14 - post mortem, unfortunately.  Will be watching  for it.  Again, Vince Flynn gave me many hours of thrilling reading - I will truly miss it!
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|Not bad. Hope there's a second one. I want more background on the eye<br />Good story good effects I enjoyed it
B004LWZW24|1.0|Hollyweird has done it again. What they term as \\"The Further\\" I belive as being hell. And the real<br />hell is much worse then they portray it to be in this film. I was also hoping for a Pastor or Priest<br />to exercise this \\"demon\\". After seeing an actual priest, for a whole two minutes, he then disapears<br />for the remainder of the film. What we get instead is some crazy old lady who claims to be a physique<br />who refers to hell as the further. (*or was it farther ~ whatever*)In any event, it's more of the same<br />old new age mumbo jumbo. You'd think that The Lord's name would be utilized here to help save this young boy<br />and his family. Instead, the name of Christ is only used for blasphemy. Typical. No Bibles, no prayers.<br />However, we do get a couple of bumbling 3rd rate ghost busters who appear quite useless. But then I<br />believe that would be the comedy relief of this silly film.<br /> Now I do realize that this film is only fictional. But when it comes to demonic possession, there should<br />be certain qualities that have some sense of reality based in fact. And I can tell you all that read this<br />review is that demons are too real. And Bill Murray will never solve your problem. If there was a<br />possitive note to all this, some of the quick scares were well imagined. And hey, having Tiny Tim do \\"Tip Toe<br />Through The Tulips\\"?? It just doesn't get scarier than that.<br /> Anyway, I put this film on the high stinker level. And if any of you out there find yourself, or family member,<br />being possessed by a demon, grab a Bible and call a Godly man. And by all means, break those old Tiny Tim records!<br />\\"BRRRR\\"!
B008AIGWVA|5.0|This is the funniest app. I've had a blast playing this next to my new kitten. I highly recommend this for any age.

B008HK3XYK|4.0|This cover is well made and does a great job. The only criticism I have on it is that after a lot of use, the hinge-area is now stretched and the magnet won't always turn off the Kindle when it closes.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|All through this movie I was kept in suspense. This was one movie where I had a hard time figuring out what was going to happen next and who was behind everything. Just when you think you have it figured out...you're wrong. This was a very exciting movie and a lot of fun, with a good amount of humor as well. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. :D
0812983459|5.0|Wasn't sure at first about the premise of this book, but a few pages in, I was enchanted. Great story of acceptance, forgiveness and the chance to begin again.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Wish allcast app still worked.  If it did this would be a 5 star,  come on google give us the ability to stream locally stored videos and pictures!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Otherwise this currently works great if you have netflicks or if you are a big youtube fan.  Otherwise untill I can use this to stream from my phone this is about all it currently can do.  I am sure more is to come so I still say buy.  (I also got 3 free months of netflicks with my purchase.  I bought the day it came out)
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Love it does what is says one of the best it's a must have download asap cleaned over a few GBs.
0439295017|3.0|I think this is a good read for the hardcore fan, and it boggles my mind that Rowling can be this detailed about her world. It's phenomenal, really, and I must give her kudos for extending her amazing Harry Potter series as far as writing the textbooks as well! Brilliant! And there are so many interesting beasts in this world... Unfortunately for me, this text also reads very much like a textbook, which is the point, of course, but doesn't really interest me. I liked how there are little notes here and there written by Harry, Ron, and Hermione, and I liked learning about the animals and the questions behind whether certain beasts were really beasts, but overall, it was a bit boring, in my opinion. However, it has sparked my interest in re-reading the wonderful Harry Potter novels, and watching the movies all over again...<br /><br />Here's my question, though. I'm hard-pressed to understand how a movie will be made out this textbook. I picked up this little novella when I heard the news the Rowling was making another movie, but I just don't see how it will be a movie as opposed to showing visuals of the encyclopedia like book. Thoughts?
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book!  This series is just as good as Fifty Shades, but not quite as intense. Spoiler alert:  I WAS disappointed to find out that it didn't end at three books.  Apparently, there are more to come.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|Whether you're a fan of James Bond or Ian Fleming or just love a well-written thriller, this book is definitely a 'must read'.<br />Set during the second world war, the novel follows the exploits of Ian Fleming as he battles against situation and foe in an attempt to save the life of Hitler.<br />The action is fast-paced and the attention to detail is exquisite as the reader is led through a plot which feels like a cross between a Bond film script and a real Ian Fleming novel.<br />It is easy to see where Ian Fleming got his ideas for the adventures of his world famous hero and Damian Stevenson is like the master himself as he weaves his tales of espionage across continents and in dangerous situations equal to any best-selling thriller novel of past or present.<br />A wonderful winner in the excitement stakes.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What a whirlwind story between these two. This book gave me quite the education in a world unfamiliar and unimaginable, the BDSM, but the emotional wreckage was totally relatable. Looking forward to seeing what happens next!

B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. It's a great way to pass the time. The only need thing I will say is the updates are pretty far behind and the new rooms find come to kindle user as fast. but other then that is s fun game.
B0050PYNP8|1.0|I liked Shaun of the dead - it had many slapstick funny moments and seemed quite original. For me, Hot Fuzz was a bit of a disappointment; I didn't find it held my attention and there were few funny moments. However, with Paul, I felt that the idea of two English geeks on holiday in the USA spending time with an Alien could be quite funny. I was hugely disappointed. I now think that Shaun of the dead was perhaps just Simon Peg's chance to shine as a one-hit-wonder.<br /><br />The two things I disliked most about this film - Paul - were the inclusion of numerous swear words and blasphemy at frequent intervals throughout the film and the many cheap shots at the beliefs of a minority of Christians that still believe that the content of the bible, in its entirety, should be taken literally. The cheap shots poking fun at Christians continue throughout the film. If a similar film were made, poking fun at cripples, gays, poor, homeless, or any other faith, I would hope that in this day and age it would be banned in the interest of promulgation of a harmonious society. A film such as this which offers such a heavily skewed, one sided criticism is only likely to promulgate wider divisions in society.<br /><br />Although I do agree with Peg et al that taking the creation narrative, as detailed in the bible, literally is a quite laughable folly, worthy of a joke or two,I am not sure that Peg et al, or the masses who may happily laugh along at the butt of their jokes are actually aware that the most populous Christian denominations (such as Anglicans and Catholics) do not adhere to the belief that the creation narrative of the bible is to be taken literally. They believe in THEISTIC EVOLUTIONISM: basically, as their Apostle's Creed states \\"...believe in one God, the Father, Almighty... ...Creater of...all things seen and unseen\\". In short, they believe that, ultimately, God is the creator of all things - all the basic elements from which everything is formed - and He provided the setting in which evolution could happen. The creation narrative, to the more enlightened Christians, represents the earliest recollections of the people that became known as Jews. It is a narrative that, with study, reflection and prayer, acts as a SPIRITUAL aid to strengthen personal bonds between the individual reader and their God: it establishes the nature of the relationship between God and mankind. This is its truth. The narrative was passed from one generation to the next by word of mouth for hundreds of years before being written down, so, as with many legends, the story has become embellished along the way in order to strengthen the main points of the narrative.<br /><br />In the film, the Christian lady that joins our guys on their journey loses her faith as a result of gaining knowledge of evolution, thereby \\"freeing\\" her to act selfishly - using obscene language without consideration or guilt for any offence or division it may cause, and the expression that she feels free to fornicate as much as she desires, without consideration or guilt for what burdan that may place on the wider community.<br /><br />I do wonder whether many people such as Simon Peg actually realise that many great scientists and thinkers, such as Monseigneur Georges Lemaitre (Big Bang Theory); Friar Gregor Mendel (Genetics), and Charles Darwin (Evolution)were (and are) devout Christians. Science is the tool which God permits mankind to use in order that He may reveal the true nature and fullest extent of His creation. Through this ongoing iterative process, mankind is able to identify, understand and accept the truth of God's revelations.<br /><br />I hope Peg's next film is more entertaining, without feeling the need to go for the quick and easy cheap laugh every two seconds.

It's got it's funny moments, too. You get into the characters heads and it even has a little element of mystery . I would strongly recommend this book.r

B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I really love this show. The relationship between the 2 lead characters is fantastic. The show can be a bit hokey at times, but you like the guys so much, that you can look right past it.
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|This slow story of lost love starts out as an in-depth character study but gets more interested after they take a trip to Lyme. Recommended reading.
0007477155|4.0|The price for all 7 books is great, the only problem I had is it took 2 and a half weeks for delivery.  Other then that I'm very satisfied.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|All the &#34;other&#34; reviews candy coat the fact that at this stage it's an inferior product. When casting to my HDTV 10 feet away from my windows 7 laptop I get a lousy &#34;standard&#34; picture and lag time. The fact it also has issues with quicktime/silverlight/netflix and other plug ins is ridiculous. While it seems small, the girth of the unit requires the use of the extention cord to fit alongside other HD cords. Hey, what do you expect from the folks who brought you a&#34;spy&#34; droid. Of course it's really just a way to get you to use Chrome. Apple user? Forget it.
B001NA6096|2.0|Predictable story about unattractive boy who meets attractive girl and spins her some unconvincing line which she oddly swallows and agrees to spend an uncomfortable night wandering round Vienna. Nothing interesting, nor especially romantic, happens. 
B0035JNTA6|3.0|Funny and slapstick, at times a bit crude but a lot of good actors. Good to see if you are not looking for a great movie.
B000002OZY|5.0|Old music lovers like me should snap this stuff up. If you have a cd player then get this before it is gone.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I just discovered Orson Scott Card, or perhaps re-discovered, when I saw that Ender's Game was made into a soon to be released film this prompted me to begin the first book in the 5 book set. I was immediately hooked. Within the next 3 days I had read the entire set. Ender's Game is an extraordinary story of a future barely imaginable ~ the novel is rich in philosophy and the intricacies of conscience of the boy as he struggles to become a man. All the sci-fi bells and whistles are there of course. The reading flows, though there is some sluggishness to the early parts but before you know it one is carried away into the rich future of Ender's reality. I had to pay the price for the novel and have no regrets. Ender's story is right up there with Frank Herbert's Dune series in its' rich creation of a reality far different from our own.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Take a bathroom break, grab a snack, and get comfy because you won't be able to stop reading. Gimme more!
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|It's a fun game! It' perfect to play in that moments when you you don't have much time and you need a fast return to reality!
B000QEIOUS|5.0|Al Pacino can play any role given to him. He is a natural actor. And at his best as a blind man who can get around in New York City streets. And he drives a $200,000 car in one scene that will make you laugh your head off. I have watched it three times. A real wild exciting film. I don't know if he was nominated for an Oscar but he should have won one. The title is a bit confusing until you see the whole feature.
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|I don't have other checkers game so i can't compare with others, but with this one i always have a good challenge when i play!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Interesting, well-acted, directed, written and designed. Worth watching repeatedly. Authentic character portraits. Three dimensional. In depth character of Thomas Barrow.
B00B1D7ANK|5.0|I have long been a fan of dragons. There's something mystical and mysterious about them. I have collected a decent assortment of dragons from ceramics to McFarlane dragons and some in-between.<br /><br />When a dragon figure is done right it can capture the imagination of kids and adults alike. This is one of those dragons. It's wonderfully detailed, is very good size, and has a fantastic pose.<br /><br />I'm not sure this is a suitable \\"toy\\" for kids because there are a few pieces that can come off (rider and wings) I'd hate to see one get lost or broken. But as a display piece (which is why I got mine) it looks absolutely stunning.<br /><br />Really like it, in fact I'll be looking at other dragons from Scheich as well to add to my collection.

B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I would just make the very small point that between &#34;White Fang&#34; and &#34;Call of the Wild&#34;,<br />I think &#34;white Fang&#34; is better for children.  &#34;Call of the Wild&#34; ends in sadness, and might not be<br />appealing to the your reader.  While White Fang&#34; ends happily.
B0000399WC|5.0|Seen this movie,when it first came out,and wanted to add it to our movie library..excellent story line,and the actors are superb!!
B0068MNO4S|5.0|I used this movie to launch a unit of research on the various theories as to the authorship of Shakespeare's works.  It made for grade conjecture in my English 11 Honors class and inspired many bold projects.  I think the acting is fabulous in the film and the whole package is transformative.
B00BWYX2MG|5.0|This product just simply works.  I have used it on three pairs of my leather motorcycle gloves, and I am extremely satisfied with it.  Just follow the instruction and dry it with a hairdryer after it's applied to the gloves.  You will be happy!  If it is not working for you, just put more on and repeat the process.<br /><br />I have recommended this to my father-in-law who is a volunteer ski patrol with Nation Ski Patrol so he can let his buddies know about this product.  They can turn all of their existing gloves into touch-screen compatible gloves.

B009R659L8|5.0|As always, another great book by Mary Higgins Clark! Can't wait for the next novel, she never seems to disappoint!
B000RLKCMI|5.0|This is the best movie ever made. I don't care especially for science fiction, but I remember when I was younger, and, walking down the street, I saw a poster for Robocop at the movie theater. My friend suggested we go and we did, but initially I thought it looked kind of dumb. Wow was I wrong. In my lifetime, I've seen thousands of films, but this is the best.
B0060D0R2C|5.0|I lived in New Orleans u TI, recently and was downtown when they were filming this so I was excited to see it.  It's a great movie with an interesting premise.  Who doesn't love Denzel?
B000FC0SIM|4.0|Let me start by saying the book is VERY autobiographical, but then again, so is writing, and I think that's one of King's points. Your work is a reflection of how you see the world.<br /><br />The paraphrase from his first editor at the newspaper when King was writing sports as a kid is worth the price of the book all by itself, as is the realization that authors are not necessarily rich people with nothing but time on their hands.<br /><br />Sometimes it's those that struggle the hardest that see the greatest rewards ... here's hoping those of us who are writers--as well as those of us who aren't--can follow in those footsteps.<br /><br />And Steve, if you ever read this, I know many of your legions of fans LOVE your narrative regarding fear, but for me--and I'll preface this by saying that I am not waiting in line to buy every word anyone writes--I think your real genius lies in your dialog.<br /><br />Personally, I would love to read more dialog driven work from you.

B00CLZ4B4I|1.0|It may have been highly colorful and packed with bold CGI, but Oz falls entirely flat. As a James Franco fan, I really wanted to like the character he played, it just couldn't be so. His character is entirely unrelateable and dislikeable. The interactions between characters lack a certain element and the acting is unconvincing(possibly because everything was filmed on green screen.) The film lacks a sense of purpose. It was excruciatingly boring to watch and we turned it off half way through. So that you can get a comparison of my opinion,two of the latest fantasy films I've seen lately that are fantastic- Life of Pi and Cloud Atlas.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I thought bringing Sherlock into the 21st century was a great move by the BBC.<br />The casting is great and the stories are fun to watch unfold.<br />I can't wait for Season Three.

B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This serious is always full of interesting legal scenarios and just when you think you can guess what they are going to do or how they are going to handle it they change it up on you. The actors are top notch and I love the diversity among them.

B00BEIYH6U|5.0|Kick Ass 2 was a fun, upbeat, and energetic movie. I can honestly say that it held my attention for the entire time, whether it was through slick action sequences or laugh-out-loud comedy. All the returning actors truly stepped up their game, which made for a great movie going experience. I was a major fan of the first one, and couldn't hide my excitement at the mention of this great sequel. Some people complained about the gore, language, and shocking humor -You paid for Kick Ass? Right?? These are the some of the thrills expected with the franchise, and to expect something else is preposterous. I believe the director did a great job with delving deeper into the emotional aspects of the characters, creating a funny yet emotional movie. As a massive fan of the first, I am proud to become a massive fan of the second. Here's to a third!
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This is a story that has an interesting perspective of a captive of a kidnapping.  The main character, Ma, and her son are in a solid, sound proof room that their captor has the only code to get in and out.  With the news finding more kidnapping victims everyday, this novel makes the situation real and heartbreaking.<br /><br />The view of the whole book is from the five years old son's perspective.  He sees everything through innocent eyes and yet he sees things and knows things that are not so innocent.  The book group that I read this with wondered whether or not he will realize later what was happening to his mother and freak out or go into a depression.  He has the sweet ideas of what his world is like.<br /><br />Ma is amazing during the whole storyline.  She moves through the different emotions while trying to help her son survive in their small world.  She has the different games and entertainment that she plays with him.  She also seems to be very aware and knowledgeable for someone who is her age that was only able to finish high school and maybe a little college.  It is heartbreaking to see her needs and wants as she helps her son understand his role in life.<br /><br />The best part of the book is the two parts.  The first part is the isolation and being captive in the small room.  The second part is being rescued.  Each part shows the struggles and triumphs of both the mother and son.
0870703781|5.0|William Eggleston makes a baby of you, forcing you to look at every tiny detail of your surroundings with new-born eyes, instantly turning the ho-hum into the my-my. And in color too, at a time when even to mention the C word in the photographic world was a one-way ticket to Hades. All that hi-falutin' preaching about shades of gray being so much deeper and poetic than prosaic color is upended by Eggleston with a few apparently careless flicks of his shutter as he spins his technicolor tales devoid of either sound or fury, certainly not told by an idiot, and signifying everything.<br /><br />To gain access to a wealth of hitherto unknown twists and turns in Eggleston's early life, you cannot do better than to turn to a wondrous new book by a very close Mississippian friend of his: Jimmy Hall, [[ASIN:0615861334 William Eggleston and Me: Photograph by William Eggleston signed front and back to Jimmy Hall]]
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Great season.  This season has many fine moments and some terrific acting.  I recommend watching this show!  It's one of the best on TV.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I got started on the Longmire books after seeing the new series on A&E.  I checked out the first book I read, bought the second and have now downloaded two more on my Kindle.  I love the twists and turns the book takes and never manage to figure out who did it until the very last minutes in the book.  I would recommend these books to anyone who likes westerns, mystery and a good read.

B000UBMZ4S|5.0|The first time I saw Blade Runner was at a theater in its initial release.<br />I left the theater stunned.<br /><br />then years later VHS comes out and I see an add that there is a different version. supposedly the corrected version. I bought it instantly.<br />I ended up buy 3 copies I watched it so often.<br />The hook for me is that, like Alien, this wasnt a space fantasy. This was actual science fiction. Except for 2001, real science fiction movies were, and are, rare.<br />Most what claims to be are actually just fantasy masquerading as science. This was realistic and dirty and brutal. Ridley Scott knew how to make a movie back then.<br /><br />I like this set mostly as a tome of the history of a classic movie. I dont find any one version (there are 5 here) perfect. There are flaws in each, but different flaws. But with movies this huge you an look past them and see what, maybe, Ridley Scott saw.<br /><br />I have a hope that at some point in the not too distant future that, now that Star Wars has been removed form Lucas' endlessly tinkering hands, that a set like this will one day come out of A New Hope. then finally we can see each version of that movie side by side, and the same progression of thought that made it the single best of the set.

B00COGZ8FU|4.0|As a Lee Child's Jack Reacher fan, I really liked the book &#34;One Shot&#34; and this movie really did it justice, despite the height challenges for the actor. I like a lot of Tom Cruise's movies, not all of them, but a good-sized chunk of them and this is one I liked.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game is really fun. You can play on a career or on multiplayer. It has very good graphics,and it is also not as touchy as other games like this that I have played. It takes a while to download, but after that you'll be glad you waited. This game definitely deserves five stars. Good job, Gameloft. Oh, and did I forget to mention that it is free? Oh yeah, it is free.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|nice app, i like the blue lighting. app does what it says in the details. kudos to creator's. thumbs up!!
B00B7ERH04|1.0|You need cam coins to go on with recording. It sucks!!!:( not worth it at all. U need to join like a company or something like that
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|Recommend this game as everyone<br />very well knows.  You can't stop playing<br />it once you start.  We need more games<br />like this one.
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|The concept was good and I did like it, but as we knew the killer early on in the book and patiently waited for the good guys to catch up (which took quite a while), I was really hoping for a huge twist at the end.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Cruise was very good in this role.  Great Movie!!  I'm not normally a big fan of his, but he did great in this role!!
B00881VLCE|5.0|Love the many varieties of puzzles you can do, from easy to challenging large ones.<br />And there so bright and colorful.
147089923X|5.0|This story is true and one of Honor and Respect from both sides of the war.<br />The negative reviewers that think this is Nazi propaganda are so wrong. The pilots hated the Nazi's as so did most of Germany. This is the story of Franz Stigler, an honest, skilled and kind man.<br />He was placed in situations which would compromise most men's honor. But not Stigler.<br />Check out photos of The Gallant Foe, or In the Presence of the Enemy.<br />The German's were not bad people in 1944, their Government was.<br />Much like today in the U.S.A.
1467934925|5.0|If you are an economist, this is something you have read several times. The 5 star rating of \\"I love it\\" seems silly. No one 'loves' reading a text book. Keynes himself said it was written for his fellow economist, and it is difficult to read. At times, the reader must go over a single paragraph several times to gain understanding. It is one of the three classics in economics along with Adam Smith's \\"The Wealth of Nations\\", and Karl Marx \\"Communist Manifesto\\".
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|I play this over and over.  Never gets tiresome!  Quick and easy to download and start playing right away! Thanks.
B008OHV4PG|1.0|A very disappointing trip to a small town in Ontario.<br /><br />If you are intested in Neil Young buy a biography, if you like his music buy his CDs. This DVD is a complete failure as far as putting the two together.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|worse movie in which i have ever seen woody harrelson appear  -- mark ruffalos character is a parody of a detective -- save your money and steer clear or buy a bag of tortillas and make quesadillas with this cheese-fest
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Very frank and honest work.  I found myself looking inward at my own career and how to apply toward self betterment
B00915G6MG|5.0|Each season is better than the last.  Sorry to see Cote de Pablo leave the series in this new season.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is very exciting and addictive at the same time. If you are a fan of hidden object games this is a great one to play.
B00ESCJG1U|4.0|Does what it says it does. Not sure if it's worth $3. Maybe lower the price and it would have more downloads.
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|Addictive in the style of Angry Birds,  you'll find yourself humming the signature music after you stop playing. Funny subplot about energy drinks!
B00A8KJN14|5.0|I'm sure bible-thumpers will have a problem with this, but normal, rational people should embrace the idea that education is important. Also important is curiosity as well as the desire to explore the mysteries of life & living.<br /><br />This movie is practically flawless and the voice work is genius (with the possible exception of Winona Ryder. Why?) &#34;Frankenweenie&#34; is visually stunning and a nice change of pace from all the garish day-glow colors seen in regular kids' movies.<br /><br />Buy it, watch it and LEARN!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|First time that I played this game,I was so ADDICTED!! I didn't want to put the game DOWN!!!! I wish it gave you more lives then it does but it still doesn't stop me from playing every time! GREAT Game, I'm SO happy I downloaded it ;)
1400049628|5.0|If you're into zombies, and all that jazz, read this book. It's very well written and is a must read for any zombie fan!
B002B79BVO|5.0|I didn't become aware of the excitement over this series until the fifth season.<br />Love unlikeable Dan Draper.  Catching up. This is fun.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Came Brand New in Great Packaging, Great movie, works great a must have for any movie collection or Sandra Bullock fan
1423140605|5.0|The mark of Athena is a great book that continues the saga of Percy Jackson and includes more characters. In this book Percy need to save the world again but this time with the help of more friends, seven friends who survive together all the challenges in their way.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|love this movie, came brand new in great packaging, works great, a must have for any movie collection or nick cage fan
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Up until a few months ago, I couldn't stand Tom Cruise, but I decided to give him another show with Ghost Protocol. Then I watched him in Oblivion (which could have been much better), then in this  movie. &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; kept the story line focused in one area, and didn't diverge onto meaningless subplots. Cruise's acting was very good, and the character makes shopping at thrift stores look cool. Based on who you are, you may or may not be glad there was no sexuality in the film, and while violence exists, none of it is gratuitous. This movie proves again that a satisfying action movie doesn't have to be rated R.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The author keeps you on your toes a great book.  This book will be one that you will not want to put down.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|These are some of the best action movies in two decades. Matt Damon's action is outstanding, though I heard he wouldn't do any more after the third which left us with that rather unsatisfying  Bourne movie in 2012. It was rather like The Office after Steve Carell left...good, but not great. So buy these three titles and see how the Bourne series is supposed to look like!
0446585041|5.0|i bought this book used, and I came in perfect condition, like it was new! I enjoyed the book a lot! I recommend buying this book! ellen is such an inspirational role model! :D
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Really a pretty good movie.Not action packed but kept you interested. You knew something was up with clues they give you but not quite sure what until the end of the movie. Keeps you guessing.
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|I cried when I first saw it, the story itself is so moving and the music beautiful. All the actors did a tremendous job with their singing. Hugh Jackman's Valjean is probably my favorite. :D
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I purchased this book for my book club and it came when it was supposed to and was in the condition it was described to be in.
B004J64QSI|5.0|This is it. My favorite version of Les Mis. Norm Lewis is my favorite Javert, and Alfie Boe is a powerful Valjean. The entire cast does an amazing job and it makes me not want to watch any other version.
0061122416|5.0|I purchased this book for my book club and it came when it was supposed to and was in the condition it was described to be in.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|I'm not in her fandom, but there is no denying the fact that this girl can sing her ass off. Very good songs from a very good singer. She has the range of Mariah Carey. Lovely.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I purchased this book for my book club and it came when it was supposed to and was in the condition it was described to be in.
B00AAQWMB4|2.0|It's not what I thought it was - much too confusing in some ways.  I may try it again some time, though.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Great show. Wish it were producing new seasons! I would be a loyal follower if it started again. Thank you for providing such a great product.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the first game I've played - loved it many years ago - and still enjoy playing it on a regular basis.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is my favorite app right now.  I can't stop playing. I highly recommend it to anyone!!  You will not be disapointed
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Easy for the whole family and the kids love it to . Great family game. My four year old can even play it it is helping him learn his colors
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Saw many weather app but this is very nice. CLEAR PICTURE. Very bright .happy I bought it. Has everything turning I need .
B00CTSDDVO|2.0|Paramount's Star Trek Into Darkness (STID) Blu-ray 3D+Blu-ray+DVD+Digital Copy)multiple movie releases epitomize how big business manipulates us, the consumers, into buying more than one copy of movies that we like. However mean this may sound, I get it: this is a business model that requires commercial alliances between the movie companies and retailers to obtain additional revenue through sales of a medium that everyone says is \\"dead\\" (DVDs)but that most consumers still prefer and that, in reality, is not going to go away.<br />However, how is it that STID purchasers can meekly accept that they will NOT get the full complement of bonuses, commentaries and features is beyond me. Please understand that the only way to have them all is to purchase three (3) separate versions of the STID Blu-ray DVD (Amazon, Target and Best Buy) AND download certain features both through a service called CinemaNow and through ITunes (if you don't have an IOS-based tablet or phone, you can't do this, either), and neither can be watched on a regular TV. One of this features (the one only available through ITunes) is a complete movie commentary that includes the complete movie and filmed comments by the director, JJ Abrams, producers, starts, etc.<br />These practices are shameful and deceitful, and only designed to milk the fan and consumer into buying multiple copies of the DVD, plus registering in CinemaNow and going to ITunes.<br />Do not get me wrong: The quality of the  various versions of STID's DVD/Blu-ray quality is outstanding, and the movie itself is a great addition to the Star Trek multiverse (I will not go into a review of the movie since most of the Amazon customers leaving a comment do that; there is no question about it, it is excellent!)<br />However, please consider these issues when contemplating the possibility of purchasing this movie in its present multiple versions. The movie is already #4 in DVD sales in Amazon (as of this writing), but if you resist the temptation of buying it NOW, and wait for the (inevitable) OTHER extended version (or versions), you will obtain a richer experience and more bang for your buck; plus, by not buying into their scheme, you are sending a message to Paramount Pictures that you are a savvy consumer, and that you will not accept this questionable marketing practice.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I enjoyed reading this mystery because it seems plausible. The ending, however, was a little abrupt, with several coincidences in which characters explain all of the missing pieces in detail.
0312611692|4.0|I had already borrowed this book from the library - 3 times! - when I decided I needed it as a permanent reference. The book arrived timely and in the condition expected. Why the West Rules--for Now looks at history in a different way than the school texts I remember. In addition to also covering events in China that I had never heard of, events in the &#34;West&#34; are given a very different weight. Agree, or disagree: This book is thought provoking.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I just received the product and It's working as suppose to. Real quality of the car charger I will know in 1-2 months of use - cheap chargers very often become lose after long time use.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a fast paced and fun game that is very addictive.  For those with little will power, I would reccomend setting the parental control so you don't one click yourself into debt.
B000A6EXNO|5.0|These are great. I have two now (one for my D800 and one for my D7000.) This cup is round (of course) which I find much more comfortable and convenient than the tear drop style. This cup is also collapsible which makes it easier to store in your camera bag. But it's not so flimsy that it collapses when in use. I highly recommend getting the DK-17m Magnifying Eyepiece to go along with this.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|This book did not end the way I exspected it to, I enjoy his style of writing he doesn't always  end the way you would anticipate.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Interesting enough for grandchildren to keep going back to find the missing clues.<br />Fun enough for 13yr olds.now can`t wait for more.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Wasn't the best movie I've ever seen. But it was fun and true to the Star Trek brand. Great movie!
B00005N6KG|5.0|This is my second headset and I have always enjoyed the sound quality and dependability.It has always served me well during excercise and world travel.
B00F35BV64|3.0|It was entertaining but not exceptional. The storyline/plot was not as good as I was hoping, but worth the rental price.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's average, the graphics are good. But every game comes with a PRICE. I was hoping you could actually pet the horse. But you, can't. I'm only writing this review became they said they would give me three gems, soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. Yeah.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Other than absolutely loving the Big Bang TV series, I was thrilled with the price and that it came so quickly.  It is so nice to own every season of this wonderfully entertaining series.  We had already purchased Season 4, but made the mistake of loaning it out to out to a friend -- who managed to lose it!  So you know it's great when this is the 2nd time I've purchased it!  Thank you.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I was excited to get this and have really enjoyed it from the first episode on.  Teen Wolf fans should own it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|love this app has tones of alarm sounds easy to navigate and has different options for snoozing and dismissal of the alarm.  my husband does not like the math problems to snooze because the more times you snooze the harder the problems get on the 10th snooze he had to pull out a calculator and at that point he couldn't go back to sleep.  i on the other hand have to get up with the first sound ivy makes because i can't see to solve the problems.  an improvement would be for the problems to base larger text for those with eye trouble.  another improvement would be for a slw light up option to slowly wake up with soft sounds.  other then those suggestions i thank this app is great being it is free
B004NS710C|5.0|Really good movie about a train with no one in the engine.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat as the train races along the track being chased by two employees who go against management and the odds to stop the train.
B000VEA38E|5.0|I enjoyed his music on Indiana Jones and star wars. this one is a great one to get if you are a fan of the movies or his music.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Not always able to retrieve earlier saved photos.My kindel will not allow me access to 2010 reunion photos. Are they still available?
B0035J6TAI|5.0|I enjoy his solo stuff as well as his Genesis. this is for any fan of peter gabriel and genesis.
0425263924|5.0|Great story hope there is more to the series!! It was hard to put down. Almost better than fifty shades, almost
B009P5S11G|5.0|I heard some of her things. I got in to her stuff 2 years ago. this is for any fan of hers.
0062255657|5.0|You could read this book as a fantasy fairy tale.  And it would be a satisfying read.  But ... there is a good chance you will be troubled by this story, and not know exactly what to make of it.  The tale is as dark as a Grimm's tale, but written with a modern appreciation of theoretical physics and modern psychology.  What actually happens in the story?, and what, if anything, is a seven year old boy's fantasy about a world he can't understand, doesn't like, and would like to leave?  How much is fable and how much is real (even if fantastically real)?  This book reminds me that our reality is not out there somewhere, but a product of our mind.  To a large extent (maybe totally), our mind is all we know.  I reread the beginning and ending of the book a couple of times, but I'm still not sure I have gleaned all the facts (myths) there within.  Much to ponder, I like that in a book.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I enjoyed all of the movies and this one is a good one to get if you like the first one.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This is a tall tale written with humour, empathy and a sense of history.  I loved this book which kept me engaged from first to last.  Imaginative and clever.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|I enjoyed the first trilogy of x men this is a good one to get if you like to know how he became wolverine.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|Do you really need a reason as to why this is a necessary album for nearly all singer-songwriter music lovers? It's Carole King. Enough said.
B000002UVX|5.0|I enjoyed his box sets and his albums. this live one is a good one to get if you are a fan of his.
B00DF92E7U|5.0|What an amazing collaboration of talent assembled in a very short period of time. The music on this disc is so high energy you body will rock out from track 1 to track 10. In addition having the opportunity to see The Rides live in support if this disc , a true rockin blues experience.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I got in to his music in 2011 when he came out with some one i use to know. it was a good song and a good album.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|My daughter loves the songs and dance numbers in this family friendly movie! She watches it over and over.. gb
B000P0J0AQ|5.0|I saw it in the movie when i was 12 years old. this is for any fan of the movie trilogy.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I have to finished reading it, but so far it is interesting.  a little slow to start, but worth the money
B000KX0HVY|5.0|I enjoyed his number ones and 2nd to none album. this one is the best. this is for any Elvis fan.
B005S9EJ14|3.0|not as expected. but a cute movie, the acting was great.  the actors are phenomenal and they make the movie worth watching
B00000IMTF|5.0|It just doesn't get any better than this. A cornerstone in my album collection since it first came out, and I still listen to it often. Blackmore is among the world's best guitarists and he showcases his talent on this album. Dio's vocals are polished and powerful. This is a must have.
B00DGXGUSY|5.0|The last decade of Amon Amarth has been an absolute pleasure to witness. They seem to have found a formula thats working, and they're sticking to it. Though there aren't many changes from their previous three albums, Deceiver of the Gods features epic lyrics, heavy power chord riffs, beautiful minor scale lines, and countless beautiful melodies.
B00911UQAS|5.0|Great model kit, I'm unsure to paint it since i've got no model painting skills, but even in its gray standard color it looks amazing.
B00BQJTHYY|5.0|Finntroll has done it again, only this time with a fun and upbeat sound. Mork folk than black metal on their current release. Still heavy with double bass and strong vocals, and now with a large selection of wooden background instrumentals.
B00BEIYLAW|2.0|So let me preface this by saying that i love Apple history and have read and watch most of stuff on Jobs out there. So i was definitely looking forward to this movie coming out.. but.. this is a HUGE disappointment.<br />They tried to jam too much into a 2hrs movie so there are lots of lots of holes and i think that those holes make this movie uninteresting.<br />Acting is fine and the story is great but this movie does bad depiction of that.<br /><br />I suppose some day someone will make a movie that will depict Job's life but i think it needs to be in smaller pieces and be more representative of the historic events.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Great movie.  Excellent quality.  If you like the other Harry Potter movies, you will like this one as well.  :)
B00F35BV64|5.0|The writers for this script deserve awards, as does whomever oversees continuity. And for those minor aspects which don't *really* fit into previous story lines or points, JJ Abrams did a fine job either working it in, or making it plausible enough to cause it to show seamless in all the franchise. Highly recommended for anyone who's into science fiction adventures.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Great, for me is just what I needed, Saves me lots of work saving in a pen drive to take my pictures and files home.
B003J27WFW|5.0|Over the last year, I've become a big fan of Rush and this 2-DVD set is outstanding of their entire career which is still going strong as ever. The bonus disk of live performances along with Dinner with Rush at a Hunting Lodge makes it even better. My only experience of live performances have come from DVDs I have purchased so I am very looking forward to seeing them in person on what I expect will end up being their 40th Anniversary Tour in 2014.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|what more can I say, Ad free angry birds is awesome. great game no issues, I only wish this was angry birds RIO or Star Wars but I'll take it.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I've loved J.R.R. the minute I first picked up his books 45 years ago and these movies don't disappoint! Glad to have them in my collection.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|very interesting game it's a puzzler for sure, makes you think. graphics are great animations are awesome. Wished more games more polished like this
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The book was suspenseful and the characters were realistic.  It makes you realize how one event and one decision can change many lives.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|they love it, it's very fluid just like a real paper, crayon and pencil. I haven't personally used it yet but will when the kids give me a chance lol.
B005KNV9LG|1.0|Has not lost any of the great voice. Wonderful are aarrangements with other wonderful artists. Some you would not think of recording with Bennett.
B00846WWVM|5.0|Sprinkle had good fluid movements with no lag, or freezes but the graphics just weren't doing it for me. It's my personal preference but the game was still good.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|My grandson and I have enjoyed playing this....until a few days ago. Now an ad starts when you start the game ,when you go to the reef store,when you go back to the reef...just about anything you do. You must wait for it to load then wait for it to let you skip ad. Not so fun anymore.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Swiftkey is a great keyboard but I find some stuff better on swype.<br />Pros<br />-fluid<br />-no bugs<br />-themes<br />-Cloud predictions and backup/trending phrases<br />-flow texting<br /><br />Cons<br />-flow texting is often wrong with words, you have to reflow the text sometimes.<br />-after a flow text it automatically spaces, so if that's not the word your trying to spell you have to press backspace so it will give you an option to choose a different word.<br />-prediction is not that great compared to swype<br /><br />but beyond that swiftkey is great, I'm really torn between the two Swype does have themes but since Swype came pre-installed on my phone I can't upgrade to the one on the play store. I guess I'll just switch between the two.
B00BP0OL1S|5.0|This book is a gem.  Any reader will benefit from the insights revealed about our (past) presidents, and learn a lot about how hard a job it really is!  A president needs all the help he or she can get, and past presidents are the only ones who truly understand what it means to carry that burden.
B000JIHP88|2.0|Looks great, sounds great, but it struggles to spin. It sometimes will spin after I push it a few times, but needing to manually push it kind of defeats the purpose.  Brand new batteries doesn't seem to matter, the motor just isn't strong enough.
1439156816|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and I recommend it to anyone who wants to become a writer. I give it two thumbs up!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It took forever to get it on back order.  It does what it says.  It would be five stars if I could cast local media from my tablet chrome browser & I could get more apps.  I specifically wish there was an AMAZON PRIME app.
B0086700CM|5.0|great app to put on a kindle. easy to use and does not take up much memory. fun to play around with when time allows.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I bought these in addition to the castle peel and stick for my granddaughter and she loves them. they are still on her wall by her bed and are still sticking perfectly. She absolutely loves them
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great app to put on a kindle. easy to use and does not take up much memory. fun to play around with when time allows.
0802473156|5.0|I read it. Applied it but if the other party is not willing to meet you at the middle, then what? Works great if the other party is also in agreement with the principles outlined in book, but if they have another agenda give the book away. Its useless. I gave mine to my dog he read it and now he is the proud father of puppies across the street. Apparently it worked for him since she was willing and able after reading too.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|great app to put on a kindle. easy to use and does not take up much memory. fun to play around with when time allows.
B005MMY9A8|3.0|Good special effects and some decent action.  Romantic angle didn't work though.  Overall story was OK, but not great.  Not the worst, but not the best comic book movie.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Good flash light and is supposed to have a long shelf life.  I will have to wait and see on that one. The flash light works fine.
B00BLRXDTQ|3.0|Be wary of any movie in a series that is over-shadowed by its own kin. The Road Warrior gets a good reputation for depicting a world torn asunder by the lawless fight for gasoline. It has some good moments, to be sure; but not wonder the first and third movies are mostly ignored.<br /><br />In fact, you can be forgiven at first for thinking Mad Max is all about an Australian gang going about their activities; but no, we are actually to fallow a cop named Max who chickens out at the sight of his hospitalized friend and learns the hard way that running away from your problems is a very bad solution. You can trust me to not spoil the ending, but in part because there's not much of an ending to spoil!<br /><br />And finally, Beyond Thunderdome is...probably co-written by children. That would explain the PG-13 rating in an otherwise R-rated trilogy, how the plot advances mostly by dumb luck and why most characters either come right out of the blue or go nowhere fast.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|great app to put on a kindle. easy to use and does not take up much memory. fun to play around with when time allows.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If u love mincemeat for pc or x box, then this is definitely for u! Very worth the price, but it doesn't have many updates yet? So hopefully there will be more stuff like red stone and those things. Awesome app, defiantly worth the 7 buckaroos.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|Great product for anyone who enjoys work outs.  It helps to pass the time and can be interrupted and picked up again at any time.
0156027321|5.0|For all the reasons everyone else has given: exquisite writing and interconnected layers of reality and perception woven seamlessly together.  The only thing I would add is that I do not see the animals as \\"allegories\\" for anything.  They are simply who they are.  They do not \\"stand in\\" for human characters, such as the sailor, the cook, the mother (this is the betrayal of the reality of animal being that Pi is forced to engage in later in the story, at the demands of his interrogators--the end result being that too many readers take their point of view as Martel's intended one).  I think Martel meant just the opposite:  The interrogators cannot conceive that the nonhuman complexity is interwoven with our own, and that our very survival depends on acknowledging, engaging and coming to terms with the wild animal in order to acknowledge the wild in ourselves, and thus our shared kinship with the spark of life itself (God, if you will).  That the wild, in other words, is the most beautiful thing about all of us.  That we are ALL kin in the creation.  Yet, in a world saturated by the repudiation of the animal, too many readers/critics simply cannot wrap their heads around this simple truth, and insist on reducing the animal being in the novel to metaphor, and Pi's relationship with them to allegory.  But what makes this novel precisely the treasure that it is, is that Martel's story is, in fact, a story of truth-telling about our purpose on this planet.  And that purpose has everything to do with seeing ourselves reflected back in the eyes and body of the flesh-and-blood animal.  Without acknowleging that kinship, we are all doomed.  In fact, the very refusal of that connection is why our oceans are poisoned, our animals are tortured, and our world is failing.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|great app to put on a kindle. easy to use and does not take up much memory. fun to play around with when time allows.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|The app is amazingly addictive and i love it. but i noticed that someone who had the exact same kindle as me had a newer version of the app. why has mine now been updated?
B003O86FMW|3.0|You know that feeling when you are reading a book and you think that the ending is going to help your life.  Yeah... Don't read this book if you are looking for that.  The sideswipe ending isn't very descriptive.  I believe that Suzanne Collins could've expressed or explained more to the ending than a hospital seen.  I hate the feeling that you know only what the character knows and the character is lost in her worm hole.<br />The ending was a shock! In some instances this is a great thing.  If you have enough content to support the shock.  I don't believe that she provided us with enough content or subject for us to feel that the ending was justified.  I have the &#34;meh&#34; feeling at the end of the book.  Sometimes you need to have something end how it should or support the shock.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Simply amazing, this game is awesome well balanced and infinite replay value I cannot recommend this game enough. Mixed with the cool art style makes it appealing to all ages
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|So many twists and turns keep you guessing during the entire novel.  It was very hard to put down.  I thought the ending was great.  So many different ways everything could have gone.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Wow, I really was not sure what I was thinking when I started this series, and now I can not put it down. I'm ready for the next one
B0014JKJJI|5.0|When I wear these at work my legs or feet never hurts. I'm on my feet for about 8 hours.  Love them!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I just started watching and I am totally addicted.  One of if not the best tv series ever. Thr Britts know whats up
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|A must see for anyone who loves any of Terrence Malick's other films...(& can appreciate his writing/directing skills..most people can not..) anyone who can appreciate cinematography, and anyone who loves film with a deep meaning behind it...I loved the behind the scenes/extra's as well..I think I'll go watch this movie, again right now!!!
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|Its a great family movie, with magic & fantasy. Robert DeNiro is hysterical. A sweet love story, everyone will enjoy.
B00ATUEKY8|5.0|I read THE BELL JAR and was sad to see the end of it. I knew that this book was going to be a wonderful time passer.
B000FVE3BG|5.0|Very nice watch, had it for about a week. I've already received numerous compliments. Face is larger than I expected, but I've grown to appreciate it.
B00005M989|5.0|yes if you love prince this is the CD for you and I was able to download it electronically right away and enjoy it with one click!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|City of bone reveals new fascinating fantasy world full of adventure, excitement, courage and love. I've a great time reading this book, not a Minute of boring. This book is the first english novel I've ever read and I learn a lot from it, especially vocabularies. It encourage me to read more english books. No doubt, the first book I pick up is the city of ash and then followed by the city of glass. The first three books of the mortal instruments are great. I like all of them and trying to find some time to read the rest of the serie including the city of the fallen angles and the city of lost soul, soon.<br />(Sorry for any mistake in writing. I'm still trying hard to improve my english)
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Got this for free but I would be willing to pay it's price given how well-made and how entertaining the app is especially for kids. It would be criminal to not give feedback for this app.
B000XUBC5E|3.0|One needs a notebook to keep track of the story!  At the end, I wasn't sure that I knew how & what exactly happened...I was relieved it was finally over!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|this app really came in handy at work today - our power was out and there are no windows in the lady's room.  Once I turned it on and set it on the counter it lit a large area and stayed on until I turned it off.  It's surprising how much light it puts out!
B000B3MIZG|1.0|DVD will not play - contacted seller about the problem. Seller was quick to reply and made some suggestions on how to make some adjustments to the disk but summarized by saying this was made for Europe - region 2 - not for US - region 1. It did state region 2 on the description of the disk but I did not understand the difference.  BEWARE of the regions for DVD as you may have a problem in viewing them.  The seller also agreed to accept the return of the DVD - not sure if this is worth the cost of the postage for the return.
B002WV5A9G|1.0|I wanted to watch Star Trek on Blue Ray HD.  The only option I found on my Roku account was the DVD that was not Blue Ray HD.  In the course of ordering this DVD, I was given the option of ordering the HD version instead.  I chose that version and am enjoying watching it, but I DID NOT ORDER THE DVD.  PLEASE REMOVE THIS CHARGE FROM MY ACCOUNT.
B004OVDVBQ|5.0|I've never read a book quite like this one........as soon as I got the rhythm of the dates, I couldn't put it down...so frightening!! Much praise for Elizabeth Haynes for this outstanding novel......thank you.....
B0063M22QO|4.0|Nice app, It keep me aware all time, nice collar, graduated level. Full recomended for all how wanna learn Mahjong
B00F35BV64|2.0|i just couldn't suspend my disbelief and enjoy this action and explosion laden movie. Too much crazy physics and improbable events , cliched lines and characters, very predictable. I found myself bored very early into the story.sorry i rented it.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This app is better than actual texting. No matter what device you have, you can text for free. I have a kindle fire HD, so I have a contact list on my device. So every one on it that has kik can text me know! Is that not amazing? You can see when others have read your messages and you can see if they are texting. You, yes you the person who is reading my review. GET THIS APP!!! (Please)(4 your own good.)
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Good book, sad, sweet, funny.  I enjoyed this book a lot and look forward to reading more from this author.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This book had more description then \\"The Hunger Games.\\"<br />I love to read, and this book had me captivated the entire time.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I could not put it down. Such a sad beautiful story about how everyone in the world is flawed but still good.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|For anyone who loves British Comedies this is GOLDEN!  John Cleese and Conne Booth were genius.  This show should have had many more seasons.  Mr Cleese if you ever read these you should revise this idea years later with your son and his wife running the hotel.  A real chip off the old block.  LOVE LOVE
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I highly recommend this book for anyone preparing a book for Kindle publication and sale.  It is definitely very helpful!
1476733953|4.0|It took me forever to read this book, only because the first 1/4 of it is pretty slow. I would read a few pages and not get into it. But about a month ago, I was flying from San Antonio to Louisville, KY and had to go through Orlando. I knew I'd have a lot of down time, and forced myself to read it by bringing nothing else onto the plane with me. I am glad I did. By the time I landed in KY (what seemed like an hour trip that was really 6) I couldn't stop. I fnished it quickly. This review wasn't meant to describe the story or try to catch your interest... Read the others for that. All I'm saying is this: if you're having trouble getting into the beginning, give it time. You won't be able to put it down later. I'm blowing through the 2nd book now.
B00571F26Y|5.0|great info....very eye opening...explains why we are in the predicament we are (diabetes, obesity etc) and how soooooo many other health issues (allergies, asthma, skin conditions, focus issues, migraines and many more) can be all but eliminated SIMPLY by eliminating wheat from the body.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins did a wonderful job of creating a fresh story for distopian fans! This series is a must read!
B004DLPXAO|2.0|Every time they \\"update\\" this app it gets slower and less responsive.  I can do without a \\"Carousel\\" and all the fancy graphics but I WOULD like it to load in less than five minutes, not freeze when I am in the middle of a sentence, not close my phone at random and NOT lose my place every other time I open it.  I love reading Kindle books on my phone but this app would try a saints patience.  I much preferred the app from a couple of years ago.  It loaded fast and did not crash.  Get rid of all the bells and whistles and go back to something that works!  If they want to upgrade this let me preview my books by read vs. unread or let me organize my books some way that makes sense for me.  I can barely tell what I have new in my library since the sorting function is worthless.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Amazing album! I cannot wait to hear what these guys put together for their sophomore project! Side note: they put on an amazing live show! I caught them in Austin Texas and I'll definitely see them again!
140053271X|5.0|The Nook simple Touch is a brilliant creation by Barnes and Noble! I have had mine for 3 months and have been overly satisfied with the simple touch screen, vast book store, and wonderful setup. As a great competitor to the Kindle the Nook has many ups and few downs, whereas the Kindle is good in its own way, but doesn't even come close to the Nook. I love my Nook Simple Touch and would recommend it to anyone.
B0073COMUW|5.0|Works great takes two days for ones eyes to adjust but after that almost going all green better then the fluorescents when they break it leaves a lot of mercury. if every household uses these we could shut down 4 or 5 coal burning power plants and two of my four girls would not have asthma
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This book along with the rest of the series is addicting and indescribable. You just want to keep reading and I shall until the series ends!!!!!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|One of the best keyboards I've found. Worth it's weight in gold. Auto correct could use a few tweaks in usability, but it's solid.
B00190N4E4|4.0|I watched this movie because I just wanted to learn and be inspired. Take the time to appreciate this story.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I kept missing the 1st esp so I was thrilled when I saw the series pop up for download. The download only took a second & now I am enjoying the fun.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This was perfect for what we needed.  It works just as well as the cords included with the Kindle when you purchase it.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|One of, if not THE, best gangster movies ever made!  I have watched it at least 20 times over the years.  LOVE IT!!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|This was the second best 3D I've seen. One of the top 3 Star Trek movies. Great special FXs. Great addition to my collection.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I have this CD in my car and listen to eat several times a week, alternating between this and his Christmas CD.
B00F1RR3Y8|4.0|Bought this for my daughter and she loves it! Easy to do and<br />lots of fun! Lots of different polishes and tattoos.
B00EL8I8IS|1.0|I watched this on my PS3 with high speed internet. This was not HD at all. Extremely disappointed with Amazon streaming service. The HD bar was displaying full marks. It just mean the actual image is horrible quality.<br /><br />I honestly want a refund on this product.
B008ANFRGQ|4.0|Steve Vai's guitar playing has soar to other galactic.  great sounding, crystal clear.  I'm not into the singing songs on this album, but there's only a couple of them.  I would just prefer hearing Vai and band , just instrumental.  all the instrumental songs are phenomenal on this cd.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Great movie and the clarity was even better I will be using this option again with my wii for sure
B007UXT6T6|4.0|Another great Cruise movie.  Great visuals, action packed, funny at times. Very enjoyable.  I'd recommended, if you are into this type of action movie.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I can't understand why everyone loves this book. It took me about half the book for me to figure out what was bothering me, I just didn't care about the characters. None of them. Sterotypical cops, slimy lawyer, unrealistic Amy and Nick.
B004FOOQV6|5.0|As someone in the military, I am constantly in other countries. Right now I live in Europe and I use this app all of the time when cooking!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Thank you for having it available. One of the best pieces of Television theatre out there! Great acting and suberb story telling!
B004PGO25O|4.0|I particularly love his writing style, it's straightforward and still artful.  I highly recommend this book!<br />Steven Pressfield has wonderful ideas!
B00D6B4PUG|1.0|What does Voyage Apps do over and over? They take advantage of the fact that on Kindle Fire you can't get any of the official Google Apps(or Firefox or Internet Explorer) from Amazon and make apps that basically do the same thing as the mobile sites of the Google Apps(exception: Chrome Sync, IE Sync, Firefox sync) and put a $0.99price on it(exception, VTube) making you pay for something that's free. You'd be better off: Using the E-mail app that's already on the Kindle Fire and is easy to use, Installing the Google Services Framework apk. from the internet and installing Gmail, Google Maps, Google Chrome(if you have an HD/2nd Gen 1st not supported)or whatever else for FREE, installing the Firefox apk for FREE, or just using Amazon Silk(the built-in browser) for FREE! It may be work getting the official Google apps, but it's all worth it.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|This was a gift for my sister. She LOVES it!  I've watched the DVD myself and it is a great one for M. Buble fans!
0440203856|5.0|One of her best books EVER! I have read many of hers, but this is one I am sure I will read again.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|A most enjoyable CD. i PLAY it every day and do not get tired of it.  Must buy more CDS.
0064431789|4.0|Great book to have as a part of the collection, and of course for the childs to begin with some reading
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|I was looking for an unusual story and certainly found it.  Very thoughtful. Definitely makes one think about how we treat animals.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This is a must watch show for anyone that like sarcastic humor. The way they take jabs at each other just keeps you drawn in because it how must people get through their own daily jobs!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Enjoyed this book immensely. It was very well written and the story and characters were very well thought out and deep. It hooked me and I'm now reading the entire series and prequels.
B005544V6A|5.0|It has everything you look for in a show to keep you entertained and wanting more! I recommend that everyone watch this show!!

B00ESY7QXI|3.0|The movie was ok at best. Good story line...but its the Great Gatsby right? Wasn't impressed with the acting or overly digitalized movie.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It's fun and entertaining.  I love playing Spider Solitaire. I'm very glad it was free but I'd be willing to pay a small fee if it were ever to be charged for.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|This was a roller coaster ride of emotions! The acting was outstanding and the special effects were a visual treat! I have to admit there were times that I wanted to hurt the screen writer, but it all turned out in the end. Being a mature fan of Star Trek I was concerned about Benedict Cumberbatch playing Khan. In my mind the only Khan is Ricardo Montalb&aacute;n. I have to say that Cumberbatch did a very good job at the part.
B001EBWING|5.0|Great classic from 1942. One liners that the young and old can appreciate. Watched it with my 20 something year olds and they enjoyed it.
B00BLF9FOK|4.0|Arnold may have been put out to pasture but he still plays the game and 'The Last Stand' is a good venue for him.  The 'official' officials seem a little dumber than expected but it was - hopefully - necessary to drive the story in the direction it needed to go.
B00001U0DP|4.0|BOY, I recommend this to everyone. This movie is exceptional. My daughter and I laughed and cried.... and cried.. Great movie
B005LAIH2C|3.0|Weird mixture of dialogue with old world charm.  The witches are vicious and exciting while the townspeople were almost typecast.  Hansel was played a little stiffly while Gretel didn't seem that in touch with herself unless she was facing off against the sheriff.  The weapons were beyond reality for the time period with the possible exception of the string of wire laced around the trees which took out a couple of witches who didn't have enough screen time.  The reveal that Gretel's mom was a white witch didn't explain why Gretel was in danger if she wasn't a practicing witch of a high order - which was the whole point of the twelve kidnappings to begin with.  Other than that, for pure escapism it wasn't bad.  And yea, Edward – although I had to turn on the sub-titles and rewind a bit to figure out what he was mumbling.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|Love this album... Also went to their concert. Had a great time. Looking forward to seeing them in concert again
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|Before I say anything else about this book, I do have to say that I did really enjoy the overall plot. The idea was very good and I really enjoyed that part of the story and based on that alone I think the movie would probably be much more entertaining to see.<br /><br />My biggest issue was the writing style. It felt like it was written by somebody rather young. The dialog didn't feel realistic to me and it took me away from the story too much. Some areas had way too much detail that really didn't need to be there and others didn't have enough. I felt myself start to skim over the pages more than read them all completely due to the writing. Because of this I don't plan on continuing the series but I do want to see the movie and hope they didn't follow the dialog from the book too closely.<br /><br />I would have rated probably 2 1/2 stars if Amazon supported half ratings. The story was good, I just couldn't get past the writing well enough to give it a better rating...
B00C7DGQ9C|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie! its one of the most fun movies I`ve seen. I sure hope there will be more love it.
B00COGXGNQ|1.0|Boring, smaltzy , characters undeveloped.  I tried but it couldn't hold my interest.  Beautiful views of Southport and surrounding area.
B00C2IJJE6|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever! The actors are wonderful and the story superb. It's long but worth it. The ending is so satisfying.
B006S009IY|5.0|It's a magical movie just let yourself release your inner child and enjoy it!  I especially love seeing Johnny Depp as a young actor playing this role.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|Well worth the money.  I bet I've been listening to this for more than 80 hours since I've purchased it.  Can't get enough.  Great album.
B00821OX98|4.0|I like alien shows. But I like the way this one also has what would happen with humanity and how we would begin to interact with each other.
B008469DGY|4.0|Easy to learn.  Got started right away.  Lots of fun if you just need to burn a few minutes here and there.
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|I really love the story Peter A Darkened Fairytale and the new book of poems is another trip into the magical realms. Some things are familiar from the first story but there are many new exciting places and characters to explore. Some of the poems are dark and others fun and sentimental, although they all paint pictures of the worlds wonderfully well. Peter, Enchantment and Stardust is such a vivid read that I will remember these poems for a very long time. O'Briens world is so amazing you will never want to leave.
0060723513|5.0|This book is fantastic since it paints a good picture of what the Aborigines are about.<br /><br />There is great wisdom contained if you're willing to dig a little deeper<br />or for some it will be just a great story<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I bought this album originally because it had Summertime Sadness, but every other song here is just as terrific! Great album!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I'm a big fan of the BBC this is a great show one show and you won't want to wait for the next one
B009RX85N0|5.0|Love it! I love fairy tales, it's so fun to watch them intertwine and take on a new life in my imagination.  I'll be watching it for the third time very soon!
030758836X|1.0|Just finished this and yuk yuk yuk. WHY did I even bother? These characters are just so not real. Nothing empathetic about them in the least. Hateful and absurd people. And that ending? Gross. I feel icky now.
B005544V6A|5.0|great story line<br /><br />great dialogs<br /><br />interesting twists and power plays<br /><br />the decors are fabulous<br /><br />and clothes are interesting and modern
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love this game..but I have played every level and finished every available challenge. Please hurry with the updates before my interest is put on a different game...I definitely recommend this game to anyone of all ages.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I have the whole 5 year series on B-Ray. I was at work and on a break and just felt the desire to see it again. I love the series... It's a great testament to imagination. You'll love the Stargate SG-1 series as well.
B0041UVBN0|5.0|This season is much better than the last and leaves you on the edge of your seat at the end, cant wait till next season is viewed.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Simply put. A must read for any scifi guru. This is my fifth time reading and I still observe pieces I missed the last four
B00A0NOF7G|3.0|It was a quick read.  As a murder mystery lover, this is missing a lot of details. Even as a cozy mystery, the author needed to pay more attention to details of her crime.  The story has potential but just didn't do it for me.
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|Fun game for all ages -- Some boards will keep you on your toes. I would suggest this game to all.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Forget apple tv this is it.<br /><br />Hard to beat the ability to broadcast and free 3 mouths of Netflix. and all for just the $35.00
B0063IH60K|3.0|Pretty good app, but don't really use it that much.  There is nothing that makes this app stand out more than any other solitare app, but when boredom strikes, solitare is always a good go-to.
B00CZF8B68|5.0|This song is so great and it has a classic sound that will never go out of style! It's time to dance!
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game.......it can be and really is addicting!  Don't play it if you have work to get done.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Easy to play in my kindle Fire HD I really love it. Any kid can play Bubble Witch Saga<br />I totally recomended
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|I find that I am not able to endorse skills of people I have worked with using the app, which can be a little frustrating.  Would like to not have to log on to a computer to do that part.  Otherwise, it's a pretty good app and I would suggest for those who are actively looking to network for job opportunities.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Very  much a sleeper hit. It's a super funny movie with tons of lines that you will be repeating later. Will watch again and again.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|The app works pretty good on the kindle although I have to admit I don't use it too much on my kindle.  I also have the Samsung Galaxy S3 phone and find that with recent upgrades on Facebook, it doesn't work like it used to.  I don't seem to have that trouble on the kindle when I do use it.
193700788X|2.0|Disappointed with the ending. Left so much unanswered. After so many years, don't we deserve more? I don't think that the ending should be exactly what I wanted, but more depth. Was so odd. Even for Sookie Stackhouse.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Google has intentionally killed the ability to play your own files. There are p.i.t.a. workarounds that will work for some files types with some audio (and even that has audio sync issues) at reduced resolution, and only through a chrome browser, but that is completely unacceptable. This is a device that is only used for Google approved content (aka you can't play your home movies). It's a shame, this was a potentially great product crippled by greed, if mine doesn't sell on ebay, I'll be returning it.<br /><br />Need a device to watch Netflix on? Then go ahead and get this, otherwise take a pass
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I liked this game, interesting story line, but it went by pretty quickly. Would like to see a longer version.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Found the ending to this series to be anticlimactic. Still enjoyed, just a little disappointed. She ended up with Sam? Confusing
B000JMKTLO|1.0|i read gone girl,,and got this one w/great anticipation,,,but it terrible,,,incest, blood, violence, childhood death, terrible sex,,,worst book ever,,,really off putting
B009WO7NQO|4.0|My 6 year old son really likes the game, but will get frustrated sometimes.  Pretty good game, I've played a little bit.  Feels a bit repetitive to me.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|I LOVE this film!  After watching in numerous times on TV I purchased this unrated edition.  It's even better than the theatrical release!  No matter how many times I watch it I still laugh throughout the movie.  This one is headed towards cult fame ...
1455526959|5.0|The most recent in the Harry Borsch series and excellent reading as always.  Michael Connelly is finding his way into being my favorite writer nudging out James Lee Burke.
B00DNDR29I|5.0|Not since the days of Parliament and the Funkadelics have I heard such a great party album. It is fun, funky, danceable and very listenable. The is great background, but if you pay attention, the message of the music come through loud and clear. Janelle Monáe may claim influences from the likes of David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust days, but I think there is a musical line connecting her to Bootsy Collins as well.<br /><br />The album is a total experience: there are spoof tracks along with the music. The comedy is based on the world of her created personae, the android Cindi Mayweather. The music is her own creation and is multilayered, funky, dancable and great listening. While the comic relief is integral to the concept, the music alone makes this worth owning. A clue of how good she is she has guest stars like Prince, Erykah Badu and Solange featured on some of the tracks and she is still the star.<br /><br />This is actually the second appearance of Janelle Monáe as Cindi Mayweather. I now have to search for her first full album, ArchAndroid. I just can't get enough of this lady!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I really love it, it's great that they made a game surrounding the movie. I think that there should be more 3D disney games for mobile devices. :)

0786956291|4.0|The red box was everything I was hoping for in quality and content. I have been an avid 2nd edition player for 20+ years but when my son and his friends showed interest in playing I figured I should get them started on something more update to date....We started the play through and I found myself disliking 4th edition more and more and by the end I had subbed all the rules from 2nd edition and just used the story from the box set.<br /><br />If you are a player just getting into Dungeons & Dragons Role playing I think you will really like this product. If you are a 3rd edition player it will be pretty easy for you to get the idea of the rule changes from 3rd to 4th.<br /><br />Again, I think it is a good product and if you have never played, it is a great place to start. I myself have decided to stick with 2nd, and even have now purchased the reprint of the 2nd edition handbooks and adventures and the kids are having a great time and dont know any better from 2nd to 4th. It all about having fun.<br /><br />Happy Gamming!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I Loved it from start to finish. Better than movie! A must read. Can't wait to read the entire series.
B0060D10I2|5.0|I love it! Watch it with your kids or significant other kids. Fascinating! Complete entertainment! Good acting! I love it!
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I just got back into reading again besides school....they books were amazing!  mist read I tell yah! ! ! !
B005544V6A|5.0|I knew nothing of this series before I began watching but now I am hooked!!! Brilliantly written and relatively classy material.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|the game is beast. I love the upgrades.I love the charecters that they have. it is a very fun game
0375703764|5.0|If you read this book, take a look at the back cover.  some printings mention the album 'haunted' by Poe.  Listening to this while reading has an eerie effect similiar to watching Wizard of Oz while listening to Dark Side of the Moon... only far less cryptic and easier to recognize the similarities... plus creepy child laughter lol.
B000Y5JFNY|2.0|When I receive the parcel. My box its spoiled. Its a heart break for a collector like me :( Should be more careful next time please
B0027MJU00|4.0|Loved the characters and the story telling. Nice surprise twist at the end. Very well written and I couldn't put it down.
B0096HKZ1M|3.0|I love b-horror films. There was plenty of action and excitment. It was worth watching but not great. Had a little T&A, not a lot though.
1439190275|4.0|Glad I ordered the new book, it will help in the Low Carb diet, will always have it to refer back to
B0089LOKHG|4.0|Though I thoroughly enjoyed this series, I found this last book a bit lacking. Compared to Before I Fall (her debut novel), it seemed as though she simply couldn't think of a good ending. The previous book, Pandemonium, gave the impression of a thought-out and well built plot, while Requiem, in my opinion, shows more signs of pandemonium than the previous one. Even though the Alex-still-being alive part was rather obvious in Pandemonium, I still felt that it worked well. Most of this book, instead of feeling like a story, just felt like it was happening, and the end especially.<br />That said, I enjoyed the Hana storyline immensely, and the writing style was just as good as it always has been; I have no complaints there.
159463176X|5.0|I was immersed in the story of these people from the first.  Sometimes I found it hard to follow because new characters would suddenly appear, but I was able to contruct the framework that held them all together.  A wonderful read!
B000SW2F8K|5.0|I love this movie!!!! I love Penolope Cruz and she looks amazing in this film.  It is a funny story without substance and a great movie if you just want to watch something lovely and entertaining without substance.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|Very pleased with the clear presentation. For 2 bucks you get a lot of functionality and easy to access info. Can't go wrong with it.
0694003611|5.0|Love the book. I was hoping the board book would be a little bigger, especially for the price I paid. It was really small, and I was disappointed. But the story itself is great.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Makes the whole experience even more enjoyable.  Highly recommended for anyone needing to move the device around a bit to get more comfortable on occasion.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome game i love it. Im at 7.5 update i wonder what 7.6 is gonna be like.<br />Thank u mojang
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Have seen the play twice; this is a close second!  Great casting, superb performances by everyone, beautiful and haunting music and poignant drama.  The interviews with cast and crew are fun and informative.  Love it, love it, love it!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Only doing this to see if I get something for free with a review. Game is fun, graphics are decent. It was free and I don't have to buy something in game to play. Not a terrible time sink did a little while
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Not my first time seeing this series, but a big fan after seeing the series. Had to get the dvd set. I absolutely love it.
B00ET7EON4|5.0|Arctic Monkeys did it again! Artfully produced. Love every second of this album which is why its the first album in some time that's I'll be playing on repeat for a good long while.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Reza Aslan provided such insight.  Growing up, we have all become familiar with the stories about Jesus.  I appreciate learning about the times, the struggles with Roman authorities, and the history that was not given to me as a youngster.  Aslan's work is never dry and so well documented.
B00D5LC4GY|3.0|Most of the time when I try to place a block in a certain spot, it snaps back to the original location, off to the side, top, or bottom of the screen. Sometimes it takes three or four tries to get it to stay put. Things like this can be aggravating enough to ruin an otherwise decent game.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This is the best romantic movie ever. I just love Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. Must see. I would say it's my all time favorite
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and would be happy is there was a sequel. I was a fast, easy read.
B000QGAU4E|5.0|Alfonso Cuaron did an awesome job with unique video sequences and special effects.  The car-getting-ambushed scene was awesome - where was the camera?  Inside the car?  Outside?  Both?  It moved through the windows?  The special effects in the fish city were also top notch - bullet holes appearing in the doors, except for the one that went through.  This movie actually raises the bar in dramatic combat SFX over the one that &#34;Saving Private Ryan&#34; set so many years ago.  Did I mention the plot?  Well, it was weak.  But the SFX, editing, and vidography rock!
B002RV01QI|5.0|Have enjoyed Enya's music for over 20 years.  She has a wonderful soothing voice.  I would say her voice has an angelic sound to it.
B0043EV774|5.0|I would recommend this movie to everyone who loves 3D/Blue Ray movies!  We loved every minute and have watched it again!
B009CF3P7E|5.0|Great movie, action, thriller, comedy and drama all wrapped up in one . They really need to bring this crew back in a series.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|How I Sold 1 Million eBooks in 5 Months!  John Locke describes a strategy for engaging his audience, it's much more than a collection of great tips.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Great flick, good cast, if you are a Trek fan or not this is a great flick to watch and will not leave you disapointed in my opinion.
B006BFK5DK|5.0|Just received my newest album by EWF: Now Then & Forever.<br />It is truly stellar. I give it 5 stars. I have been a fan  of this musical group since their inception back in the 70's. Of all the music from back then up to now, this is my favorite group & they have outdone themselves on this album. Earth Wind & Fire keep moving us with your music.
B005LJJESY|4.0|Good movie and I love amazon streaming as it never buffers or queques on me, if your a DC fan then this is a must see film.
B00F35BV64|3.0|Couldn't wait to see it and then couldn't believe how unoriginal the story line was.<br />I'm sure I speak for all Star Trek fans when I say the new crew is outstanding!!<br />These young actors have nailed their characters to perfection.<br />That being said have all the good writers moved over to TV?<br />Totally unoriginal script!<br />Oh well, maybe the next one will be better.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie. I've never been a Trekkie but these two movies might make me reconsider. I thought cumberbatch's performance was really good. The one thing I didn't understand was...if Kahn could use a personal transporter to travel instantly to the Klingon planet...why is everyone else using spaceships?
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Keeps you gripped the whole time. I finished it in one day but that's because I couldn't put it down.
B004UID2LC|3.0|It's not a bad app hard to manage once in a while if you're not spot on to watch a video.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|Great movie would definitely recommend to all sci fi buffs. Worth every minute spent watching.  Even though it is a bit dated
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I wish I could give less than one star.  I can't understand the popularity of this book.  It reads like something written by a teenager with a wild imagination ... and romanticizing the victim-abuser relationship sends a dangerous message to vulnerable young women.
B005544TRQ|4.0|It's likeable, but not really sure what it wants to be at this point. I don't think they anticipated it going the whole season.  But i'll keep watching to see how it pans out. Typical story with the characters secretly in love and drama at every turn. If you watch any show you will probably get drawn in... because they all have the same formula for the most part.
140006922X|5.0|The book was a gift for a friend of mine.  I haven't read it but I did ask to borrow it when he's finished.  Interesting premise.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This author grabs your attention from the beginning. He weaves a very interesting story with several characters. It can be a little confusing at times. Overall I,d say it was a great read and I highly recommend it.
1451678193|1.0|This was urged on me by friends who love Bradbury.  To save my life, I can't get into it.  My loss, I'm sure.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a great game, best with 4 players.  Every game is different which makes it interesting but keeps the familiarity of play and strategy.  The quality of the product is good but the board could be a little thicker to ensure the pieces lie flat on table.  The game pieces are pretty basic but serve their purpose.  All and all, this is a great game to play, lots of fun.
B003U69IX6|5.0|I really like the series.  They did cut a lot out of the book but did a great job. Great cast
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|We enjoyed it. It was interesting. It wasn't a ton of action, but enough to entertain. When it becomes free, I will probably watch it again.
B00DU73T08|5.0|I wanted to see it in the theater but never got the chance. Was a good story line. Glad I didnt see it in theaters. Hopefully they come out with the rest of the books.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Hi all,<br /><br />I actually like this game but they constantly flash ads saying \\"your phone might have a virus.\\"  I find it very annoying but more importantly, if I was less savvy, I might think my phone actually has a virus.  I'm sure there are grandmas and grandpas who stop playing immediately and take their phones to a shop and get charged out the wazoo for the company to fix something that isn't broken.<br /><br />Please realize your phone does not have a virus.<br /><br />Coin Dozer: Find less annoying phishing ads.<br /><br />End of rant.
B003YVCJQ0|5.0|WILL SMITH.  Always an amazing actor. All of his action flicks are amazing. His humor and his laugh makes the movie.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I'm an imagery scientist (engineer) and a strong supporter of the Google echo system so I'll say my opinion is somewhat scientific and objective. The truth is that I was very disappointed on my initial testing with Netflix. It takes a while to load Netflix (twice as more than on a PS3/Xbox), it loses frames, to the point where most of the movie doesn't flow smoothly -it looks jumpy-. The initial two minutes had a lot of pixilation, many scenes lose sharpness and color gamut (contrast). On a couple of very fast scene on Transformers: Dark of the moon I had like 40 seconds of plain awful blocking or pixilation. I've never seen blocking so intense and for so long ever before, not even when streaming from a cellphone. The surround sound wasn't there all the time either, and on some scenes it was hard to understand the dialogues. These are deal breakers on a streaming device and I hope people can get over the hype. This device needs a lot of work.<br /><br />Bad value for the price because it is cheap, but it does only one thing: streaming. It is pretty bad on doing it so.<br /><br />Lack of features is evident: it only streams (compared to an apple TV or PS3)<br /><br />Ease of Use: The fact that you can only control the chromecast from other devices makes it a bit cumbersome and clunky.<br /><br />Ease of Set Up: the fact that you have to download apps or use a computer to set it up makes the set up a bit choppy. My TV did not had USB. The provided power supply is a big box, I had to unplugged a couple of devices to make it work. The cable of the power supply is of very cheap material, and it tangles very easily.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Real good game that got me and my little brother into dinosaurs. It takes time and patience but it s definitely worth it. I would recommend it for anyone whose are into games like Farm Ville and Sims
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Awesome. I don't really need it that much in FPS because I am used to slow sensitivities but, if you need a mouse that will allow you to turn around fast and get that lucky head-shot in CS:GO, you'll love it. Can easily change sensitivities and can program all 9 buttons as shown. Can even change the color of the light that is emitted on it. Will be looking for more Anker products in the future. :D
B0085CXVOC|5.0|I go back and watch this a few times a year.  A great movie to watch and enjoy the humor and the adventure.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Gillian flynn keeps you turning the pages.  I have read all her books. Her first book is as good as her last.
B00BP4X3W2|4.0|Has a good message about what's worth in life. Would be nice if there were subtitles option on Amazon for rentals when watching on smart TV or devices.
B00AEFYKSO|5.0|In Australia, this movie is impossible to obtain on DVD/Blu Ray (Region 4). But as the Blu Ray player on my PS3 is region free, it's party time.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I saw this in the theater. This was the kind of movie that when it is over you are a little depressed. It was so good you didn't want it to end. I love Star Trek, and consider myself a Star Trek geek, but I don't memorize trivia or dress up or anything. I just grew up watching Star Trek Next Generation and the others. I thought from the minute this movie started, it was fantastic. I also love all the new super hero movies, and if you like those, you will probably like this. You don't even have to know anything about Star Trek, but it will help you to get some of the jokes and understand the personalities of the main characters. I love JJ Abrams' new version of Star Trek. It's for a \\"modern,\\" younger audience; it's full of huge, action-packed fantastic scenes. Benedict Cumberbatch was brilliant and sexy as Khan. I love Chris Pine as Captain Kirk and Zachary Quinto is an awesome Spock. Simon Pegg as Scotty is fantastic and he has a great story in this one. A very talented cast and greatly written/directed movie. I will be buying this. I knew I would buy this 5 minutes into the movie. I have the first one too. :)

0553573411|5.0|When last we saw young FitzChivalry, the King's designated assassin, he was prostrate in the Mountain Kingdom, having barely survived an attack by Prince Regal, the youngest of the three royal brothers, who also feels most entitled to run the kingdom himself. But the Redship Raiders are harrowing the coast yet again, so Fitz finally begins the trek back to Buckkeep -- only to find himself relegated to a much more minor role and surrounded by dynastic intrigues. He also ignores the best advice of his closest friends and mentors and advances his courtship of Molly to a dangerous level -- dangerous to him personally and dangerous to the girl, because Regal won't pass up any opportunity to serve him badly. Prince Verity, meanwhile, the King-in-Waiting who holds Fitz's unswerving personal loyalty, goes off on what seems an ill-advised quest to seek the Elderlings of ancient folktale as help against the raiders. And that leaves Regal more or less in charge, with their father, King Shrewd, gradually wasting away.<br /><br />But an overarching theme this time is the bonding between Fitz and a young wolf he rescues, via the \\"Wit.\\" If he's caught, the revelation of his close animal relationship will get him hanged, drawn, and quartered, but he can't help it. The Wit is part of his basic personality. But Nighteyes, the wolf, is also a much stronger personality than any mental contact Fitz has made in the past, and the two become so close as to constitute almost a single being.<br /><br />Hobb has established a reputation for doing horrible things to her heroes and she continues that practice here. Fitz suffers, the King suffers, Prince Verity suffers. And Regal makes sure the entire kingdom suffers, to his own benefit. There's not much humor to lighten things along the way, either. What there is, is tight, complex plotting, bloody battles, beautifully rendered character portraits of people you will either loathe or come to care about deeply, and a richly painted background against which everything happens. This is very, very high-quality fantasy.inst which everything happens. This is very, very high-quality fantasy.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Skipped the 3-D version when this was in theaters, but happy I bought the 3-D blu-ray. Very natural and creative use of the process. As far as content, I really enjoy the movie, but am disappointed about the skimpy bonus features-- as so many reviewers have pointed out. This business of spreading extras across various retailers is a mean trick to pull on fans-- and it's not logical to tick us off!

B006LSZECO|3.0|The story was okay, but easy to figure out - no real mystery.  Really does not live up to the hype.  Moves along fast in the beginning and then toward the middle it gets a little slow and uninteresting.  Like I said, no real mystery.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|This movie kicked major butt!! I seen it in IMAX 3D and watching a movie in 3D hasn't been the same since! I can't wait for it to come out on 3D blu-ray so I can't watch it multiple times in the comfort of my own living room, haha! If you love sci-fi and anything that'll leave you on the edge of your seat anticipating the next scene, WATCH IT!

B0071XO8RA|3.0|Hugh Howey's self-published sci-fi series `Wool' became a literary phenomenon in 2012, quickly becoming the most-celebrated breakout book in the vanguard of indie publishing's assault on the literary landscape. A traditional publishing deal, much commercial and critical success and two further installments --- a prequel `Shift' and a concluding sequel `Dust' --- all followed in quick order. Once the hype and hoopla had settled, I decided to find out for myself if the story itself was any good. This review is based on Book 1: The Wool Omnibus. I'll dispense with a full plot description but there will be spoilers anyway!<br /><br />There are five separate parts in Wool but the story can be viewed as a simpler three-act drama.<br /><br />Act 1 sets the scene. We learn about the status quo in Silo 18, both structural and societal, through the passing of the guard. Current sheriff Holston follows his wife in voluntarily undertaking the fatal task of `cleaning'. Thereafter a new sheriff, story heroine Jules, is installed. But Jules quickly loses those championing her as key leaders at the top of the silo hierarchy literally go from the top of the food chain to the bottom through a quick succession of sudden deaths. This is the strongest and most intriguing section of the book. We learn about the various sub-societies --- departments --- in the silo as well as its physical make-up and resources/limitations. Howey is a skilled world-builder and adds each layer to the environment with measured assurance. Equally, he is adept at building characters, giving each main player in this act some welcome sufficient backstory to establish personality and temperament. It's all done with spare yet very readable prose.<br /><br />Act 2 describes the events of Jules's short tenure as sheriff and the incidents which lead to her eventual exile, to clean as a punishment for her meddling. Before that she befriends a male technician, Lukas, who grows troubled about the treatment of Jules at the hands of the Silo authorities and increasingly skeptical about their true agenda. This act is where the book started to get a little `baggy' for me. The early parts spend so much time inside Jules's thoughts as she reacts to the tragic events which mark her entry into the job and as she dives into the findings by her predecessor, Holston, about the true nature of the Silo. I find large tracts of prose that are 3rd person narration about how a character is feeling and what they are thinking to be trying and unengaging. 8 out the 10 pages in the first chapter of this act alone were exactly that. It's one of the reasons I didn't *get* The Hunger Games --- too much internalizing instead of observing, a way of `telling' dressed up as `showing'. When Jules is finally ousted by the main villain Bernard --- true master of the silo --- it's accomplished in such a casual and off-handed way as to be underwhelming; no tension, no conflict, no resistance from our feisty heroine, just Bernard's `I've had just about enough of your pesky meddling, you young brat!' (I'm paraphrasing.)<br /><br />The final Act 3 charts the consequences of Jules's actions, an uprising within the Silo, this discovery of another abandoned silo by Jules after her exile and the resolution of the power-wobble in the whole establishment. Here, Wool descended into disappointing meah'ness as far as a reading experience. This is supposed to be the climax yet all the strands of it are diffused and disparate through most of these pages. The events of the last act take place over about a month. Jules remains stranded in the near-deserted Silo 17, spending this period undertaking to make it habitable and a therefore  a viable challenger to the oppressive regime in her original Silo 18. Lukas spends most of the climax in a basement in Silo 18 reading and eating well. And the insurgents of Silo 18 spend the month fighting, running and dying, in what read like a protracted version of the opening scene of Star Wars(the stormtrooper assault on the rebel freighter) wherein it takes Vader days to get down that one corridor rather than seconds). I was also reminded of the interminable middle section of the Dark Knight Rises, with Bruce Wayne stuck in a his own personal Shawshank Redemption, GPD sitting around eating Ramen noodles in the tunnels and Bane walking around Gotham pontificating, all over the course of several weeks in what was supposed to be a tense bridge to the climatic conflict. In short, Wool's climax sacrifices escapism and excitement for pragmatism and practicality. I appreciate that the series is playing the long game at this point, knowing there are two more books to come, but as a one-off reading experience, Wool Book 1 suffers for being cast as the plot fluffer when the craft and imagination that began it deserved its own payoff at the climax of Book 1. Only in the last brief elements of this closing Act do the main players cross swords in any meaningful way, as Lukas is condemned to his own cleaning and Jules must park her plans at silo home-making to save him. Even then, this denouement was sullied for me by the curve-ball decisions made by two characters (regarding the start and end of Lukas's cleaning) that seemed to be little more than Deus Ex Machinas without any groundwork to explain them or any elegance in applying them.<br /><br />Despite my reservations at the ever-loosening and fragmented progression of the plot (frustrations borne more out of my getting sucked into the early section and hoping for an ever more tightening of developments, if I'm being honest), I still found Wool to be a page-turner and overall an interesting read. Howey is a worthy standard-bearer for the new breed of writers; so many self-published books are derivative, carbon-copies of already flimsy constructs, wafer-thin stock characters, cheesy dialog and clunk prose. Hugh Howey ably demonstrates that he is quantum leaps ahead of the pack in all those aspects, both among hiscontemporaries in Indie publishing but equally when stacked against many of the established names in traditional genre writing.<br />True, he does occasionally display a propensity to overegg his metaphors and imagery (dust swirls are described as being `frolicking twins... solid playful children returning once more to dreams and scattered mist.') or to describe horrible events and scenes by lavish helpings of mood sauce and a large side of poetic lyricism rather than just giving the rare bloody steak [I, for one] would prefer to get my teeth into (a character who dies in a hail of gunfire sees another's `deathly dance' before experiencing `...for a tremble of time, the end of him[self] that came next.') But these are minor nitpicks when weighed against the accomplishment of his imagination and attention to craft. It's original, engaging and intriguing, but lacking tension and urgency when it most needs it.

B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I really like this film. I am a Star Trek fan from way back. This movie felt authentic and I really like finding out the history of Khan. They can keep going with these films and thrilling fans with these actors who do each character justice.
1616550414|3.0|I was pretty thrilled after purchasing this item; a book with the artwork and history of the entire Zelda series was a must-have for me. I purchased the hardcover new with the standard shipping. It arrived in decent time; however, upon opening the box, the plastic appeared to have been removed. there are a few large and very noticeable nicks along the edges, the corners are crushed in, and there is a massive dent on the bottom edge of the binding. While I am disappointed in the overall condition of the item, it is still an excellent piece to have for any fan of The Legend of Zelda series.

Now if I go to the beach, or trekking trails, or wherever, I have both hands free to carry other stuff, or free to help me balance myself as I climb higher!<br />The bag is lightweight and yet still padded nicely to protect my camera gear. And it's much easier to carry through the airport cuz it's on my back, leaving my hands free to carry my suitcase and my computer!!

Then he and her best friend and cousin fall in love.<br />Rachel is still mourning her teenaged daughter who was murdered twenty years ago, and obsesses with the man she thinks is the murderer.<br />Writer Moriarty takes us into the lives of these three very different women, patiently weaving together their stories with a balance of intrigue and heart, empathy without pity, difficult circumstances without creating victims.<br />Because this is a novel about secrets, I'm afraid to say too much, lest I reveal any spoilers.<br />If you like books with moral conundrums, complex situations and characters, add THE HUSBAND'S SECRET to your list. You won't be disappointed.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I can´t stop playing.  it is a very addicting game.  Good for your mental health, I guess, Good job with this one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was so much fun. I couldn't stop... more, more!!!! I was really upset to see I had played all the rooms. Totally addictive game. I loved that it used math and exercised my memory. I found the puzzles to be challenging, but not so difficult that I needed to, or wanted to give up.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is by far the best  in the trilogy. If you read the first two, this book is a must read.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Rather a story of selfishness and just plain greed. Lots of twists and turns finding the guilty and just plan evil.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|Tom is cute, sweet and funny.  His puppy friend?...is such a little stinker and has no mercy for his buddy, yet Tom is so loveable and patient.  He helps me laugh at my voice when it comes from his lips to my ears. I like to pet him and hear his purr, but watch out one can get a little slap happy with him too!
0811879542|5.0|I bought this book for my son's 3rd birthday not entirely sure if he'd like it. He LOVES it! And I love that it's an interactive book without all the bells and whistles. The book fun for him and it helps learn a little too. I thought he may get bored with it after the first time since it's not a story book and he already knows what will happen but he didn't. He often picks this as one of his bedtime books. It's great for little ones that love books, especially those that like to participate when reading.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I really enjoy this game, yet it's hard and awfully hard to follow some of the information statements, cause they go to fast. It needs to have more and better instruction for the mystery game itself, cause Richard needs to be found sooner! It is fun to play though and really helps with my speeding up my eye and hand coordination in reacting to the I spy stuff in the pictures,but I need more seconds! Thanks for a grand time!!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I got this as a gift for a friend with a newborn baby.  She loved it for her little guy.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|Just a great movie with lots of memories of my youth. Great actors and a delightful script, Every collection should have.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Fantastic upbeat music along with superb violin playing.  My wife and I are both 50 and our 27 year old daughter introduced us to this music.  Truly enjoyable, and her videos on Youtube are very entertaining.  This is definitely music for young and old alike.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I got this on the FAOTD several months ago and have replayed it dozens of times since.  One of my favorites on my Kindle Fire.
B00EDF43MY|5.0|My daughter is 2.5 years old and she really loves this game.  I don't think she understands exactly what is going on but she is able to figure out how to interact with the game to make it &#34;do things.&#34;  There are several activities in this game - stamping passports, going through security, visiting lost and found, and even washing the plane.  I recommend this game for children age 2 and up.
0618918248|4.0|I must have declaim that this review may only be applicable for a very minority all of you. I guess this is more like a warning rather than a book review. English being my second language, I found this book extreme hard to read. I probably spent 50% of the time looking up words, 35% of the time understanding and the rest on actual reading. This book is also difficult in other ways as well; I have had a genuine hard time in reading the very long sentences; where it is possible that there are multiple meanings and ideology in just one sentence. I guess this is what you guys describe as poetic.<br />Dawkins style and approach in the book seemed to target those who have a very strong foundation in the subject of religion. In my opinion, it is common that Dawkins will only spent one or two sentence on some very fundamental concept which this book tries to build on. Very often I have to dot down definitions on notebook, or I consistently have to flip back and forth on the pages in which the concept was written on. It is a habit for me as a reassuring measure to match what I think the author meant and what the author actually meant. One way to do this is to ingrain the profound concepts in the book by keep reading it over and over again. So I guess what I am trying to say is, if you are a person that mimics myself which considers himself that English isn't one of your strength and put security in a high priority when reading then I can guarantee you to have a formidable time reading this book and sometime even anger, tediousness and temptation in giving up may come into play.<br />Apart from my inabilities and shortcomings, I have to admit that Dawkins is right on the money in his argument. The way in which he structured his paragraph has made anyone extremely difficult to argue against. As you may have guess the majority of the jokes and humor he used in the book, I cannot fully comprehend but I suspect they are extremely hilarious. My dream would be in wishing this bookwas written using simpler language. To me, using a longer word rather than the synonym of the word in which is more commonly used does not make the argument more convincing. But I know this dream of mine will never be fulfill. The alternative being me actually getting better in English!<br />But the end of the day, I finished the book. I can accomplish that mainly because I have a genuine interest in the subject of religion as I am also a rebellious person and has wonder about the topic for a very long time. I am also a victim of being coerced to go the church every Sunday mornings and evenings. So my conclusion is that, it is undeniable that one will benefit from reading this book, but one, given the aforementioned special circumstances, might have to gain it from the HARD WAY.
B00C1GBOU6|5.0|As a Sigur Ros and Jonsi fan, I am very happy with this album.<br />Valtari was a very mellow, ambient voyage which I very much enjoyed. Kveikur feels just as aggressive as Valtari felt ambient.<br />By \\"aggressive\\" I don't mean \\"angry,\\" only that Kveikur is filled with slightly more aggressive emotions, but they still retain the same beauty I associate with Sigur Ros.
0385523394|1.0|How this came to be a \\"recommendation\\" on my Kindle at the end of a Regency England romance, I'll never know. (Yeah, I read lots of diff. stuff, but still)  I read the blurb, but having been burned before, decided to try the \\"sample\\" before committing to buying ... THANK HEAVEN!  I didn't need to proceed any further to realize I did NOT want to read the rest.  This ... female? girl? (certainly not what I think of as a real WOMAN) has been, and still IS -- even after a short 1 yr. prison sentence which w/o her monied family & their $$$ lawyers certainly would've been MUCH longer -- a self-indulgent, self-righteous (in the \\"I'm more groovy than YOU\\" way), so-called trendy hipster.  She's of a decided liberal bent, which perhaps explains a lot; on the 4th pg. (Kindle sample) she manages sarcasm over \\"the depths of the FIRST Bush recession.\\"  (you remember, ca. 1992.  Where the hell has she been last 5 yrs.?!)<br /><br />She graduates from Smith (which you're banged over the head with multiple times, even just in the sample) w/degree in theater but no real plans, and evidently makes a decision to be lesbian (not that she's definite in that preference, tho: she says often how cool & hip these east coast les. are).  Hangs out w/drug dealers & their runners, travels the world on drug money and \\"anxiety\\" (gee, wonder why?).  Makes some sort of half-assed career that eventually allows name-dropping, multi-culti claptrap, and oh! finds a man that loves her, so she loves him back!  Did I mention she went to Smith, came from BIG $$$, thinks she's groovy & major hipster?  Oh, also blonde & beautiful, which is what one would expect from rich SMITH girl, huh?<br /><br />If I got all this from the sample ... omg, I'm SO glad I didn't feel forced to ramble on with her in the mire & muck simply b/c I'd spent $$ on this trash.
B00BCX2F66|5.0|Very delicious and amazing I put on this pone case on fine and it look very delicious thank you Samsung for happy.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Never a dull moment, special effects, same characters but younger and they did a great job.  Well worth the $3.99 and can't wait to see the next movie.
1608871827|5.0|It was a great gift idea for a hard core fan!  The graphics are excellent and I received it promptly.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|a few extra minutes added really adds to the story. not sure why these scenes were cut from the theatrical release. this is a very entertaining movie.
B004LZFWJO|4.0|It is hard to stop playing once you start.  It is also fun for my five year old daughter.  My only complaint is the sound it makes at the end of each game... no matter how good you did, it sounds like you lost.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|If you like his last cd you definitely like this one. Easy listening folk sounding music. A definite buy for your collection
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Love a movie where stuff blows up.  Hope the continue to make Dredd movies.  Wish they would of done more stuff with the guns
B004UPANAI|5.0|hugh jackman what else to say YEAH! he is fab! love all xmen movies ALL well done great action. wolverine has always been my favorite xman for 40 years! but with hugh playing him...off the charts!!! love sabor tooth too! his brother! I even got my sister to watch and she only watches mob wives and horror movies and she LOVED it sooo much she watched ALL xmen movies!!! shock shock!<br />but its THAT GREAT!
B006PAV1XO|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. I am a fan of Jesse Eisenberg.  You are going to see the Kristen Stewart face she makes in all of her movies. the story is funny as well.  Who doesn't like a carney movie
B00756GRUE|5.0|Looks great and has a link for diving with wetsuits. Solar function needs no battery replacement very easy to read underwater
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is Great for my daughter and her home work we love it this app gets 5 Starts down load it
B003TH2LYY|5.0|As I said in my review of season1 this is a great show! I enjoy watching it. I watch it on my iPad & it is very clear not grainy.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|Predictable but cute.  The previews did not give away the entire movie for once. Would recommend if you're not wanting to overuse your brain while watching a movie-- very light.
B003THHIEM|5.0|I love this show. It is a crime story but not too gruesome with just enough humor added. Detective Beckett & Castle have great chemistry! All the actors do a great job.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Castle fans will enjoy the book. If you are not a fan of the show the book is just a very quick read. Castle fans will picture the show leads enacting the story. I recommend this for Castle fans, I don't think non-fans would enjoy the Nikki Heat books as much simply because the show ties in strongly with the Heat series. By this I mean the main characters not necessarily the show story lines.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I enjoyed the book, as I enjoy reading about other cultures.  I thought his first two books were great!  This book jumped around too much.  The main problem was that when you start to read a new chapter, you don't know who it is about until you get a few pages into it......very hard to follow.  I got used to it, but I didn't recommend it to my husband, who doesn't like flashbacks and this would drive him crazy.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|This is my favorite TV show. I love that the show doesn't take itself too seriously and I also love the two leads. Wonderful actors. I have all 5 DVDs and will collect all as long as the show continues.
B00DQVST76|1.0|One star for the pathetic audio.5 stars for the show. U would think as great as this show Is the sound would be incredible.  It is not no matter what I do. I have a Bose system. It sound like bad audio from the 70's.
B007REV4YI|5.0|skyfall is one of the best movies of 007 is so amazing what's bond do and the scene whit motocircles at the begining is exciting
B004QSQMKE|5.0|So, glad i found this movie! It was one of my faves from child hood. What's even better is that my son watched it with me & he really enjoys it as well!!!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I already owned the dvd of this movie, when I purchased a new 3d tv this is the first movie I purchased.  this is the only one I would replace in 3d that I already owned.  it was worth the purchase.  the 3d made watching it much more enjoyable.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It's a very very very good app. It's well executed. But the ads get annoying sometimes. But some may not be annoyed by it. Just my opinion.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Engrossing and addictive. Will keep you occupied for hours of game play time...be careful not to play if you have to be somewhere.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Although I haven't been so easily swayed by the JJ Abrams approach to the Star Trek Universe, I did thoroughly enjoy this second addition to the series and thought that the plot twists were quite amazing.
B00821OX98|5.0|Do not let the beginning fool you. This series takes an episode to get you completely immersed in the story.
B009PMEEY2|3.0|This game would be a whole lot better if the touch interface weren't so jumpy. When you think you're going to make a long run, it might stop in the middle of the run and only collect half. Makes it frustrating when you're on a timer and a few seconds will make a big difference.
B00847KFDS|5.0|The songs are familiar, and never grow old.  However, the arrangements are new.  I especially like the tracks with Zac Brown (Bad Moon Rising); Miranda Lambert (Wrote a Song for Everyone), and John's sons.(Lodi).
B002KGEORM|5.0|Finally catching up. Thanks, Amazon Prime.<br /><br />I &#34;cut the cable a few years back and haven't caut up on SOA. Now I finally get the chance.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|WONDERFUL movie with gorgeous scenery. The Amazon instant movie was grainy and skipped. This movie is worth the money to buy it. The book is even better.
0061900656|5.0|I bought this book for my 2 year old 2 months before I was due to have my second child. He took to it right away and we read it daily. He loved to point out the little boy and say it was himself. The book tells a story that it simple yet engaging. I highly recommend.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|In a long line of good lawyer shows this one is the best one on TV now. If you're not watching you SHOULD!
B005IQZB14|5.0|A really good book. I felt it touch a empty spot in me that will aide me in my own healing.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A great period series that makes you want to see more than just 9 episodes a season! A must see!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My daughter and I loved Downton Abbey! It's got drama, humor, romance and it's clean...suitable for young teens. We are really looking forward to season four.
1401216676|5.0|This book came when expected, although a little late it in the day. I already knew what the product was and had read it before, but wanted another copy. Very happy with the process. This is a great graphic novel, if you are into them.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have read this trilogy 3 times, I have them in paperback, and so I can read them over and over again when the mood hits me I wanted them on my tablet. Great if you just want to read something that takes you away from the real world and to give you some very good ideals.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|This game is very fun and addicting, I love this game. The background music and sounds are a bit annoying, but overall it's great!
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|Tried to open this repeatedly after download. Never could open it.  Almost always have problems with G5 games for Kindle Fire. Would have liked to play this game.
1451627289|5.0|Best Stephen King on a long time!  Surprises all through the book, NOT a history lesson, that I was afraid of.
098478280X|5.0|150 pages. very useful especially for whom never really has chance to know what is going about get a job
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I love love love this app. Can't get enough of it. Will be using on all of my pictures because it makes the pictures taken with your phone look like they were taken by a pro
B00E3BK0QQ|3.0|Good game but for 5 dollars you would expect it to be longer than 3 hrs.  It was fun for the time I played it.
B00ET9T2WK|5.0|Really good game I recommend this game because of the good graphics and many more like fighting and just really cool things
B009IH0ICG|4.0|I didn't think I'd want to use this item to start a charcoal grill. I bought some lighter fluid just in case. I thought I'd have problems using it. However, it works pretty well and is easy to use once you know how to use it. The first time I didn't know how to use it so I used the lighter fluid. After that I looked online for a video on how to use one of these gadgets and now I'm a pro. Now I wish I never bought that lighter fluid that's why I bought this thing in the first place. I didn't want to store the fluid in my garage. Anyway, it works, I like it, but I give it 4 stars because the handle gets kind of hot after the coals heat up. I don't know if all charcoal starters get hot handles or if this one does because its small. But you should always wear a barbeque mitt or some type of glove to protect your hands when using this.
B002GHHHME|5.0|getting my favorite movies in DVD.my VCR no longer works.do not have a VCR to play my tapes.so all of my favorite movies-Im getting in DVD.Thank-you.
B001B51B9M|5.0|We saw this movie when it first came out in theaters, and I saw it with my family several times after that.  Now that I'm a grandparent, I wanted to share it with my grandchildren.  They love it, too.<br /><br />I have seen no problems with the transfer, as some of the previous reviews have suggested.<br /><br />It's a five-star experience all the way around.
B00004STDN|5.0|love this movie.had it in VHS-my VCR doesnt work anymore.all I have is a DVD player now-getting favorite movies in DVD.THank-you
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It is very useful and numbers are really big so I don't worry about hitting the wrong numbers.  It really is a great app
0425252868|5.0|True story, well written - really griping stuff could not put it down once started. A great addition to my WW2 collection of books.<br />Also great service by Amazon.
B001O6W9QC|4.0|Not the best movie I've ever seen in my life, but still good none-the-less. If you want a movie that will make you go &#34;what the f is going on,&#34; then you'll love this. And as always, RDJ doesn't disappoint.
B0053TMP24|5.0|It was cool I thought the other series was good but this one was way better I really loved this book
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|Blue-ray has special features, which is what I wanted. And I was able to give my dad the dvd since the loved the movie. All around good.
B00E7SID9G|5.0|well-researched; reads well and challenges some cosy views as it unscrambles how Jesus's message got lost in the set-up of the church in rome...what could be better.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|This case is very flexible and easy to store.The only complaint that I have is that it had taken to long to receive.I was told that it would take some time to receive which turned out to be almost a month.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|If you have not seen this stellar program when first broadcast on BBC America, do so ASAP! The lead actors, especially David Tennant and Olivia Colman, act their pants off as a disgraced DCI assigned to Broadchurch as punishment for a botched-up murder investigation and the resentful DS who was passed over for the position.  Yet these two come together to investigate the murder of a local 10-year-old boy.  Small town dynamics, secrets, resentments, are all uncovered while investigating this crime.  BBC Television at its finest!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love love love iiittttt it is awsome.I got a bunch of points on my first try its a great game for kids
B000XUBFE2|3.0|disturbed by so many dirty words ,not heard that often ever in Germany by anyone. , other then that it was .ok
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|This book was OK for young adults, me being 25, found it very predictable and somewhat boring.  But I could see how teenagers would enjoy it.
B00ACBN9CI|1.0|Kindle fire is primitive tablet. Even 50 dollars tablets are better than kindle. Of course this is another cheap, no control games similar to games which was designed in 1994. No fun and I am stuck with this one till I have money to buy the galaxy or Ipad.
B000VM9Z8K|5.0|Remember Me is a great way to spend a lazy, quiet weekend - right in line with all of the other Sophie Kinsella books.  Entertaining, sweet, love story.

B0042X9L6A|5.0|My Photobug spouse loves the flash.....easy to use, take on & off & very good illumination for all his efforts.  Thanks
B003YV64OI|5.0|I had been searching for a CPU to upgrade my Compaq Presario CQ5602F that has the M2N68-LA motherboard in it.  Most of the CPU's that I found for upgrades are no longer available.  I had read some reviews about this processor and decided to give it a try even though it was for a AM3 and not AM2+ socket.<br /><br />The processor installed easily, Windows 7 recognized it and after a few minutes of updates was up and running.  This processor is like having a new computer.  Runs faster than my laptop with an i3 processor.  Running programs like photoshop are now no problem for my computer and huge files process very quickly.<br /><br />Note:  I saw somewhere that on this motherboard the onboard video may not work with this processor.  I can't deny or confirm as I had a graphics card installed prior to installing the Athlon II X3.
B00008G7UJ|4.0|My daughter is such a fan of Shakespere & Leo, this was a must for her collection.  She even has a quote tattooed on the back of her neck!

B00D67DI9O|4.0|\\"Darken Her Horse\\" was one of 2011's best songs. Forget genre, forget style, the opening track to Austra's debut album was one of the best tracks that you'd find on any record that year. It's a dark, gothic track the swells, pulses, and grows in its seemingly brief 5-minute run time. The song begins with almost tribal-like vocals from frontwoman Katie Stelmanis, but by the end of the song, it's all full-blown electronica. For Austra's second LP, Olympia, there aren't any songs like \\"Darken Her Horse.\\" The band has evolved from a songwriting vehicle for Katie Stelmanis into an outright synthpop band, and with this change, there's some improvements to the band's sound and some things that were left behind in 2011.<br /><br />So here's the good news: Austra is in much tighter shape than they were with the previous Feel It Break. Most of the rough edges from their debut have been shaven away in favor of tight instrumentation and poppy arrangements. Almost every song here has something to like, and the sounds used on Olympia are very carefully selected and prepared. There's a lot of attention paid towards what these songs sound like, and while they all inhabit the same style, the perfectionism pays off. The lyrics are also a highlight here - Stelmanis' lyrical voice can be genuinely biting at times. \\"I Don't Care (I'm a Man)\\" throws a dark misogynistic narrator into an album normally filled with romantic longing and loneliness. Stelmanis' vocals are just as good as ever, and her shuddering, but strong, voice still stands as one of the defining characteristics of the band on Olympia.<br /><br />Now here's the bad news: while Austra has grown from Stelmanis' project into a band, it's also lost some of the fun quirks it once had. With the exception of the wonderful \\"You Changed My Life\\", there's not a lot of chances being taken here. Earlier, I mentioned that there were no songs like \\"Darken Her Horse\\", but there aren't any songs that even come close to resembling that song on Olympia. The band just isn't in that head space. The songs on Feel It Break inhabited a space - there was a sense of material and weight in the songs there. On Olympia, the songs feel like they were created in the studio. So, while it may feel more professional, it also feels much less organic.<br /><br />Olympia finds Austra at a strange place in the band's trajectory: will the band become a shiny, polished, dance group? Or will they revert back into a more experimental electronic project? Their second album is a success, and it will likely give the band a bigger spotlight in the mainstream eye - but Olympia feels slightly more faceless. That's not so bad, of course, there's nothing wrong with a solid pop album; these songs vary between ones that will put listeners on the dance floor and those that will have folks singing along. \\"Home\\" will likely have fans doing both. It might be one of the more finely crafted pop songs this year, and Stelmanis manages to sound vulnerable, hurt, and defiant in the same stroke. It's likely that as Austra becomes a more collaborative effort, they'll veer further away from the sounds of Feel It Break. Is that good or bad? It's neither - it's just different. But depending on what you're looking for in your electro-pop, or what you liked in Austra's first album, Olympia can be divisive.on Olympia. The band just isn't in that head space.

0307950654|5.0|The plot continued in a very similar vein, still with the misunderstandings but a twist of murder-mystery.  Very good 'sequel'
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Overall a good movie if you are a Star Tek fan. I gave it 4 stars because I do not believe that the producers should have used the original Star Trek characters names in the movie, there is/was only one Captain Kirk and that was William Shatner. Using the original character names with new actors detracts from the movie.
1451695195|3.0|My hubby read it & felt the neurosurgeon could have used an editor/translator more.  If you are on the fence about the afterlife, this may  push you either way.
B00BAXTYBW|3.0|Don't quite know how they blew this one....  It's enjoyable and has some interesting turns here and there, but nothing compared to the other 5 original star trek movies.
0525478817|4.0|Interesting style, character development & plot twists.  Nice love story & coming of age too.  The author is quirky--his writing reflects it, but I liked it!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Characters and plot lines are so good.  Very enjoyable and entertaining.  The lives of people similar to those featured on the movieTitanic.
034580404X|3.0|Just mediocre writing, over the top sex stuff---reminded me too much of my ex-husband sex addict!  But curiousity killed the cat, but 'satisfaction' brought him back.....sort of.....very predictable plot beyond the S& M descriptions... most of which I skipped over after the umpteenth time!  Good Luck with trying to do a movie that isn't X rated!
B00104W8T6|5.0|What more can one say:  Juno and the music behind it are simply wonderful.  I have seen the film about ten to twenty times.  The album I listed to over and over again - at work and in the car.
0743243153|5.0|&#34;Life is difficult!  Once you accept that, it gets easier to deal with it!&#34;  lol  Ironically my Ex sent me this book as an I-don't-know-what, but it was great anyways!  Gave to my daughter for her psychology collection!
B00004XQ83|5.0|&#34;One Death&#34; alone is worth much more than the purchase price, even full retail.  The film is a classic.  The album is a classic.  Buy it now!
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Congrats you made the game worse. I used to be able to open it and play older levels. NOW I CANT EVEN OPEN IT!!!!!!!!!
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Episodes are realistic and acting is excellent. Julianna Margulies does a fantastic job in this role and I have gone back and rewatched all of the first two seasons.
B000KZBRG6|5.0|Good price, accurate and very reasonable.  Can put it in you pocket and it fits in the palm of your hand.  Has decent incident reading.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Awesome album. Even more awesome band. This is a MUST OWN if you're a Megadeth fan. Its the pinnacle of what metal should sound like. From start to finish it has hard hitting riffs and killer ear splitting drum kicks. Sure to blast the speakers if you like loud heavy metal in your face!!!!
B0089EHWQE|3.0|Not the strongest or most moving read...a bit predictable even with some of the character inconsistencies. Still a book that promises to insure a good and lively discussion about what rights a para does and should have. Would have liked stronger characters and some character closure, but an ok read.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Always been a fan of Queens of the Stone Age, but I think this is by far my favorite of their albums. So far, this is my favorite album of 2013. If you're a fan of QotSA, it's definitely worth a shot.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. Being an introvert I found this book both enlightening and refreshing. It's nice to know that people think the same way I do about a lot of things. As an introvert or even an extrovert you should really pick this book up it'll change the way you think about people.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Good book, very well written!  Only problem is the slap of reality of the daily grind of prison life!  But overall the book is an excellent read!
B0089LOKHG|1.0|Holy cow! That was not good. First of all, the ending was lame, I mean if you can even call it an ending. Second of all I could care  less about Hana and was really irritated that every other chapter was her lame story. Also, the fact that Lena basically used Julian to get over Alex, and when she realized she still loved Alex, she still used Julian. Ugh!! This whole book was a waste of time. The first book was so good and this series had a lot of promise.....and then nothing but a let down
B00F35BV64|4.0|I really liked the movie - I enjoyed the action sequences and felt Scotty's character stole the movie.  Worth the rental!
0307341550|5.0|Such a great price for a brand new book! Much cheaper than buying in stores! it was a great read too
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This app is awesome and if you ever need help on it you go to youtube.com and type in &quot;can you escape level...&quot; and type in the level you are stuck on, needs more levels and there's no hints, but thank you youtube you're a big help!!!!!
1476712042|5.0|Such a great price for a brand new book! Much cheaper than buying in stores! it was a great read too
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|My tv is far from my pcs and this was the exact solution for me. Now my tv got an improvement, all the content of internet in my tv with just a click. And my cellphone became my remote control.
1476715904|5.0|Such a great price for a brand new book! Much cheaper than buying in stores! it was a great read too
B00C2GJWNG|5.0|Awesome debut album from a rising star. Great vocals and guitar work. I am looking forward to his follow up album.
0307341577|5.0|Such a great price for a brand new book! Much cheaper than buying in stores! it was a great read too
B00B19H2KU|3.0|Story was decent, acting wasn't bad.  Had very few moments where i actually felt my heart jump.  I did enjoy the plot, though
0525478817|5.0|Such a great price for a brand new book! Much cheaper than buying in stores! it was a great read too
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|I'm really not much of a video game person so I'm not going to say good or bad about this game.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This book touched my heart and when I finished reading it I felt like I missed the characters. I actually developed an attachment to them and their struggles. Hearing this type of story from a child's perspective really makes it resonate. Looking at his world through his eyes really caused me to think, and the obvious love between him and his mother is heart warming. What a motivational story.
0375842209|4.0|The Book Thief by Markus Zusak is a unique take on a World War II story.  Narrated by Death (yes, Death is a narrator), the reader is told the story of Liesel Meminger.<br /><br />Liesel is a young girl, a book thief, who is living with foster parents in Germany after her brother is killed and her mother is unable to care for her.  She becomes close to her Papa and learns how to take the war into her own hands: thievery and by keeping secrets.<br /><br />I'm surprised that this is a young adult book.  Not because the topic is too mature, but because it didn't feel YA in the least.  This felt like an adult novel.<br /><br />Also, two of my friends started and then did not finish this book.  But I think that's a mistake.  The Book Thief is unique and narration by Death is actually one of the most interesting perspectives I have ever read.<br /><br />Who is the most interesting narrator you know?<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rebecca @ Love at First Book
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is a great book. One that I will be sure to revisit after some time.<br />The main characters are well thought out and realized and the story is a great take on a true underdog/ David vs. Goliath scenario. It's a really fun look at video game sub culture and an interesting &#34;what if&#34; scenario looking at the disconnect people have between real life and the separate lives some gamers live on-line.<br />I also loved the authors use of 80's pop culture to fill out the virtual world and how he used this to build a contrast between it and the real world.<br /><br />This was my first time using the Whispersync for Voice feature offered by Amazon. I was able to buy the kindle edition and the Audible edition for a great discount and thought i'd try it out. I will have a hard time in the future if I do not have this option available on a book I am reading. The ability to set down my kindle, hop in the car and connect my phone and have the story pick up exactly where I left off, was amazing. 5 stars just for Whispersync for Voice.<br /><br />Wil Wheaton as the narrator was fantastic. His mannerisms and use of inflection are outstanding and helped build a compelling world that sucked me in. When switching between the kindle and audible editions, i found myself reading the story in Wils voice and loving every second of it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a fun story and one that focuses highly on the lives of video gamers with great call backs to the 80s and everything great and not so great that came out of them.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|great game lots of investigating would reccomend to all who love hidden mystery games. love the games like the block and pipe games. they are an added bonus.
B001BANK32|4.0|I haven't read this book for along time or not at all. And it didn't disappoint me. I loved it  like Under the Dome.
B000Q66HBE|5.0|This has to be one of the best metal core albums out there. I love bfmv and this album blew me away. I would strongly recommend listening to it.
0142000663|5.0|It's a book. It's the correct book and as advertised. Shipped quickly and was in great condition. Would order again if I need hard copy books.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game has some bugs- but overall the graphics are awesome; I . Love racing online as well! I'M all about cars and technology_ Really cool game!
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|a brain teaser ...not quite what I expected... but still engaging , I got mine for free, might be worth  the money if you like brain teasers
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love Subway Surfers. I played Temple Run for a while, and my friend told me about this. My initial thoughts were \\"Oh look another Temple Run ripoff\\" I was wrong!!!! This game is 100x better and a bit more interesting.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|Great song especially for the summer.<br />Had to purchase the song after watching Pharrell sing it for the first time in a small venue and the vibe was off the charts. A definite addition to everyone's library.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|The story just keeps getting more and more interesting that I don't mind re-watching all of the seasons. Truly a fan of the show.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book was very informative and enjoyable reading. It should be required reading for men and women of all ages.
B001BC2ZS6|4.0|The book is really good, but sometimes as Latin American reader, is difficult to understand the slang words of the book. The book has a awesome plot. I fully recommend this book to others
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|the game is fun and addicting but its so glitchy. things are always going wrong and the game crashes often. the developers need to step up and fix the many issues that plague this game.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|I couldn't ask for more! Madonna gets another great hit with the release of her MDNA tour. i read some of the reviews about the Blue ray DVD coming defected from production, well i purchased it before reading those reviews, so when i got it delivered i thought i would have to check it out (just in case) and get it ready for a return right away. Well well well, for my surprise i didn't have to, it came ALL RIGHT! everything works fine. the sound and image are great. Yes the image is not as clear as many thought, but for what i can tell is the style of the video, yet is VERY good quality image. it has this \\"oldish\\" style look, keeping the modernity and color of blue ray. how's that? i love it! it's almost like Madonna and her team went an extra mile on doing something different from the rest. and they did! in my opinion they did a fantastic job. the edition is great, some of the cases i feel like i'm in the show, by the end of any song i'm exhausted, there is so much going on to watch some times. so I recommend this product sincerely.<br /><br />I'm guessing some of those who comment against the blue ray dvd were Lady gaga's little monsters since Madonna performs \\"Express yourself\\" and \\"Born this way\\" in the same song proving gaga copied that song sound from \\"Express yourself\\" adding in the end a piece of \\"She's not me\\" song.<br /><br />So anyone who fears or is hesitant to buy the blue ray dvd i would say go for it. i don't think a company would let this happen specially someone so powerful and influential like Madonna. But if that's the case of a defected DVD you can always return it. no big deal. I'm sure they are taking notes on the issues people write here.<br /><br />The blue ray DVD is alright, there is nothing wrong with it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best app ever!!! It's minecraft on the Android. It's a must have!!! XD  there's zombies and creepers and much more
0374275637|4.0|The back cover blurbs may have overstated the case (...as important as Adam Smith 'Wealth of Nations', etc. etc.) but after borrowing from library did buy copy to examine further. Certainly a must read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just love playing this game. I could spend hours playing it, if you are a fan of the movies, specially the minions this is a must have!
B00F35BV64|2.0|The Special effects are mostly aacceptable but with the usual lack of respect for basic physics which should work even a universe where warp speed is possible.  Suspended dis belief drops like a stone.  The screenplay had to have been written by a fifth grader. I'm still waiting ffir fhe ST franchise to embrace serious science fiction.
B005K17RU0|5.0|loaded the app. no problems.  gives accurate weather.  great weather app for the kindle fire.  like also the frequently updates.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I have really enjoyed playing this game so far. My only complaint is when I connect to the net to visit other towns my game lags so bad its almost not playable. Doesn't matter if I stay in my town or go Visiting. Please don't let that deter you though( I shut my wifi off until I'm ready to visit ) this is a very fun game and your energy refills fairly quick like so even if you can't do a lot at one time you can still go back and play multiple times  a day
B00BNWWVFG|5.0|this movie was very clear and there was no skips or stops it played all the way through luv it i will be buying more very soon :-)
B000RH0C8G|5.0|This book is an inspiring read, even for those who may not be huge fans of baseball. Human beings do the same things over and over for traditions sake, rarely taking the time to analyze and ask the question 'why'. Moneyball is about seeing things as they really are and the challenges of confronting the conventional wisdom in the very traditional game of baseball. I have a huge respect for Billy Beane and the Oakland Athletics for their approach and the results they were able to achieve on their minuscule budget speaks for itself.
B000V63AVY|4.0|Supertramp takes me back to my Jr. High days. I put this on my wish list quite a while ago. I've been watching it drop in price and snagged it when it hit $5.  Nice music to listen to while having a BBQ and taking to the gang about the old days!
B009WO7NQO|1.0|it glitches and i cant even play. its the most annoying thing cause i used to play and now i cant.
B000TEMRO4|5.0|I've loved Blondie since the 80s. Such energy and fun music!  It's been on my wish list for a while now. Excited it made it to the 100 CDs for $5 each promo.  Anyone that is a lover of music from that era should have this CD.
B0097EWK3A|1.0|Not sure why this game was rated so well.Free version doesn't  let you  get very far. Not worth my time to load.
B004HO6HWA|5.0|Statham hits the head of the nail with this flick.  Although you cant really compare to Chares Bronson's original, it has lots of action, violence, good storyline and acting and the movie has a proper ending. Donald Sutherland was a definate plus. A must for all Statham fans.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Good little pocket sharpener!!  Does a good job for a quick sharpen!!!  I take it everywhere with me!!  I have it hangin on my key chain...
B00006FDCD|5.0|Stephen King does it again! Tim curry was perfect as Pennywise. This is a good movie although a little drawn out (as many of King's movies are). About 3/4 of the movie is about character development and flashbacks, but nontheless King comes thru. The clown Pennywise himself is creepy enough to give you nightmares....those teeth!!  Oh yes, they float down here.. ha ha!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I heard about the show so I decided to watch it. I love it and can't wait til the next season
B00000G3PA|5.0|This movie is so korny and far-fetched, but who cares!  You've got an excellent cast including Liv Tyler, Brue Willis and the rest of his crew, a believable real life senario, plenty of action, a little romance, and you might even shed a tear. This movie is lots of fun, so take it as entertainment, get the popcorn and enjoy, and it may help you overlook the abserdness of the movie..
B0090P98Z4|5.0|The best RPG game I've ever played this game is a game that i could play all day everyday the best ever im  ever gonna stop killing and leveling up and becomming the strongest ever
B000099T3P|5.0|This movie is fun although korny at times.  It would have been more enjoyable without the mother (Dee Wallace) and daughter acting stupid and screaming throughout the movie, but the crazy, and sometimes humorous antics of the critters make up for it. They are mean, hungery little varmits!
0425264351|4.0|This first Reacher book was the prelude to the many to come. An excellent read and foundation for the series.
B000ASATYO|5.0|Too bad this movie was so under-rated when originally released. Michael J Fox  was superb and fit the part perfectly.The special effects/CGI were top notch for the time. Acting and story line is great and keeps you moving right along.  You have scary moments, plenty of humor, a little violence, and even a couple tender moments. R Lee Ermey in the cemetary was great. Get back in your graves!! This edition has several added scenes I've never seen before..
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|To be waited upon hand and foot, and have such a sheltered view of how the other 99% live, what's not to like? Of course, we know that it won't last, but it's a great fantasy that captures one's wishful thinking. To me it's escapism at its upmost, much akin to all those dreams one has with a single lottery ticket on a billion dollar jackpot.<br />The casting is superb, and the actors play their roles exceedingly well. Plot twists are expertly woven into the general story line with a democratic sharing of good folks and bad folks among the upstairs and the downstairs characters.<br />All in all a wonderful tale of a magical world. I just hope that the last season doesn't include the scene where Lord and Lady Grantham are showing all the tourists, who have paid 10 pounds each, around the place.
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|This is definately the best of the series. The acting, plot and storyline are top notch and is almost believable..Sam Neil and Jeff Goldblum are a good plus.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Love reading historical fiction.  Learning about the life and time of real people from the past.  This book lived up to all expectations.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|This show is top intertainment. I was so sad to learn that they ended this show. It is so much better than many of the &#34; reality shows&#34; that are on. Thank you Amazon for giving us access to it. I look forward to watching all episodes!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the entire series, all three volumes. Kept my interest the entire time. Hope Suzanne Collins writes another series soon.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|New in wrapper, thanks for the great deal. Show looks stunning in Blu-ray compared to AMC HD. Must have as a collector and once again, very stunning in Blu-ray quality
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the entire series, all three volumes.  Hope Suzanne Collins writes another series soon, will certainly buy the books if she writes another series.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|New in wrapper, thanks for the great deal. Show looks stunning in Blu-ray compared to AMC HD. Must have as a collector and once again, very stunning in Blu-ray quality
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|The digital copy is the UltraViolet. SO you cant store it on your mobile device. Which sucks for those who travel and want to watch their movie on the plane.
B008J05EL8|3.0|May I recommend the life application study bible and the word search program. Adding these two items to your bible study line up would be awesome.
1451695187|4.0|Interesting subject matter to me.  I saw the author when he did a TV interview and became interested in reading his story.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Another winner for Cassandra Clare! Sad to have missed her book signing in Hong Kong!  The book,Once started, can't be put down! Her characters are so real & well loved.
B009O2XY12|3.0|This is an entertaining game if you have few minutes to toss. Makes you think a little but it just doesn't reload fast enough. Sometimes you wait an hour before you can play again. Of course you can always \\"pay\\" to play sooner!<br />But then, it happened.....the game simply stopped. It won't start up. I have uninstalled in and then re-installed it and it still won't play.<br />I haven't reported this issue twice and still haven't had a response. Wny give you the option to report an issue if no one is going to respond?<br />It's still working on my kindle but not on my android phone.<br /><br />Guessing customer is service in not a big part of their business.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Cassandra Clare has an amazing gift with her writing!  When reading,It feels like you are actually watching a movie. This series of Books, &#34; The Mortal Instrument&#34;s, is &#34;nail-biting excitement!! Impossible to put down once the book is started! NOT to be missed!
B000SEGEKI|5.0|This book has lots of good advice. I also like the fact that it is not dependent on any single language.
B00DIZS5GU|5.0|I have seen and heard many Verdi Requiems and this one has become my new favorite.  Baremboim's conducting strikes a perfect balance of exacting control and all-out Italianate passion, the orchestra and chorus producing sounds both spiritually ethereal and secularly voluptous.  The four soloists are equal to illustrious colleagues of Requiems past.  All of them have beautiful voices of course, but what makes this performance so satisfying is the complete commitment each singer makes to the text.  This Requiem really grasps the viewer as a \\"drama.\\"  I do not hesitate in giving this dvd my highest reccommendation and unlike the other reviewer, my disc was flawless.
0312360266|4.0|This review was originally posted at Book Travels book blog!<br /><br />I remember back in my Twilight days when I was looking for a book to satiate my vampire hunger because I was in a desperate need to get over them, or at least, to obsess with something else. And, I recall Marked was always popping out as a book recommendation. I was definitely intrigued by the book description, but somehow, I never got around to reading the series.<br /><br />Anyway, I finally got the chance to read Marked thanks to a library book sale (pretty awesome) and I'm very happy to say that it came out to be a really cool book. It has a great female lead character named Zoey Redbird, who doesn't take poopies (hehe) from anyone, and is definitely a unique person both inside and out. I liked the way she lifted her head high and smiled when most would have searched a dark corner to hide and possibly to cry their eyes out.<br /><br />The friendship Zoey built between Stevie Rae and the gang was also cute and sweet. I thought they were fun and nice fellows, though sometimes they came out to be a little bit too cheesy for my taste. On another matter, Erik Night was the super hot fledgling (vampyre in training) that was supposed to catch my heart along with Zoey's, but sadly, he did not. Maybe because everything happened too fast, and I somehow got the feeling he was just interested in Zoey's uniqueness. I don't know, I just felt that, but my hunch may be completely wrong and I'll probably end up falling hard for him too. It is wise to change opinions from time to time.<br /><br />The House of Night series is great vampire goodness, filled with darkness both good and bad. I do want the next books, all of them. They are a ton! Hopefully they will be as good as this one, maybe even better and having them almost all available for purchase is definitely a plus. Go get them pronto!<br /><br />*Note: This review was originally posted at Book Travels romance book blog!*
0321857895|4.0|Mike does a good job in showing us how he thinks.  A good purchase for a new graduate going off to school, or the seasoned professional who often finds himself sitting in loads of meetings.  This book will teach you how to make meetings fun again!
B00821OX98|5.0|Love this series.  I missed the 1st series originally.  Glad to finally get a chance to go back and see how things started.
1557048630|5.0|I love to look at the artwork that goes into making a movie.  Great Stuff!! Worthy for your shelf if you love these types of books.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is an excellent story told in a matter of fact manner. The author weaves the tale of the characters with finesse, pulling you into their universe. Even the supporting characters are given substance. You will not be disappointed.
1781164150|5.0|Just the right amount of text with the right amount of imagery.  If you love looking at the artwork that goes into making a film, this is a great book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Could not put down the first book and now I could not put down this one. I cryed laughed and blushed though the book if you read the first book and like me have to get to the end you'll not be disappointed.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I find this a great app to use for my Kindle Fire to let me know how much time I have available for use of the different features on the Kindle. If I know I'm going to be away from a power source for any amount of time I can check and see just how much battery power I will have available to me or if I need to go ahead and charge it and how long that will take. Always be prepared, Get This APP!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Christian and Ana could not get a break so much napping all the way to the end yet thy never stoped loving each other best story I have read in a loge time love the epilogue on Christian view very creative and wish there was more in the story. But over all loved it.
B007STBUIW|5.0|Jaws was a shock to all when it was first released. I have seen it a number of times since then and finally bought the disk. It is still one of the best suspense films ever made. I expect to watch it yet again in the near future.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was hesitant to read dignity shades of grey but I am so glad I did. But it may not be for everyone. Yes there a lot of hotness between. Mr Gray and miss steel a loooottttt but for me I added to the story the there relationship grow from it and it was a joy to find out where it was going to take them. To find out about Mr. Grays past and why he is the way he is can't what to read the next two.
B008469DGY|5.0|Fun game.  Plays nicely.  No glitches nor did it ever lock up my Kindle.  Great to pass time with.  Definitely recommend it.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I started with season three, so I had to go back and watch the first two seasons - fantastic - and I'm so glad I did!
B005RYF5JA|4.0|My wife and my great granddaughter really enjoyed this movie.  Great movie, It was delivered in the schedules time. And<br />it was viewed by us and our neighbors.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it. Makes me so sad though when I read between the lines. The world can be a cruel place and we have to do what is right by our self versus what others want/push us to do..
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoy reading anywhere and anytime. It is wonderful to put on my headset and listen as well as reading the Bible.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|Very good item for other than gaming. I have been using it In my job as function and scripts command module.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|This was a gift to my husband.  He was excited and have watched it several times.  He thinks this is the best of Sylvester Stallone.
B005LAIIMG|2.0|This big budget pig was too grandiose to be a good zombie movie.  Too much globe trotting.  Too much  political commentary. And the resolution to the problem and ending were too soft.<br />Good zombie cinema deals with pockets of society, not the world as a whole.  You see a core group of people deal with an untenable situation. You get to guess who gets picked off next. Its fun.  Superhero Brad Pitt spanning the globe to singlehandedly save the world is not so fun.
B008JFUNYG|5.0|This film was far better than I had expected. It is similar to the original but takes a different path making it original in itself.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like this game a lot . It is fun and I enjoy it and it is free. good game. love it.
B00AJLHUA8|1.0|I barely finished this movie.Very boring and a waste of money. I would not suggest buying it. I give it one star!
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|Just recently got into Queens of the Stone Age. Loved this new album so much that I purchased their entire discography!
B00192IV0O|4.0|This is a great Cd.  Love the Black Eyed Peas and wish they were still working together.  Hope they will reunite one of these days.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|If you want an alarm clock with a stop watch weather and show the wind mileage then you should get this app
1455523003|5.0|Exactly what i wanted, thank you. I never thought life could ever get this good. All my dreams are now fulfilled.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A friend recommended this book to me.  I was unfamiliar with this writer.  I found this novel hard to put down, so I've purchased &#34;Dark Places&#34; as well.  Can't wait to read it.
B00CHILW64|5.0|My boyfriend and I watched this and we both loved it.  It's very tastefully done, though it is not for the squeamish.  Depictions of injuries in the film are intense, but I think they need to be.  230,000 people died in the Indian ocean tsunami, the subject matter isn't going to be light and fluffy, but it is inspiring and moving.  The performances are fantastic.  I recommend reading a little about the real family after you watch the film.  The woman upon whom Naomi Watts' character is based is a real life force to be reckoned with, who sees the lucky, fragile, precarious beauty of life in a way that I wish I myself could reach.
B009FZHYKU|1.0|\\"Insufficient bandwidth\\" error message. This is all I see every 30 seconds. I thought it was a problem with my system until I googled it and saw that it was a widespread issue that amazon has failed to correct. I probably won't be keeping my amazon prime until I know they can fix the problem.
B008N1V11U|5.0|My 2 sons who are 3 & 4 love this game. At first I did not think that they would be able to handle it. They love Batman and kept whining for this game. They absolutely love it . I am trying to learn how to play so that I can know what they are doing.

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I loved this book.  The story of a woman who has truly lost herself and is quickly going downhill morally and spiritually and then on a whim puts herself on a path of true discovery and character building is lesson for us all on what it takes to become the person your higher power intended for you to be.  It's not easy and the steps can be hard to take, but redemption is possible.

B00005JLEU|5.0|My daughter is a lover of all things Anime, so this is a welcomed addition to our collection!  No regrets on this purchase!
B009ZQFSRA|2.0|While it may have been in the &#34;style of the Matrix&#34;, it wasn't even close in plot, character depth and overall substance. The whole concept of a future like this simply wasn't worth making a movie about - it was that silly. I almost shut the movie off a couple of times but decided to wait it out hoping it would get better....it didn't. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was for the acting, which was far superior to the script. Don't waste your time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can't wait for the new levels to come out! Challenging yet doable and very addicting. Level 7 was my biggest challenge-
B0063GORYU|4.0|I enjoy playing it on my kindle almost daily. Because it's free, you get the ads, they're easy to delete so no problem.
B00BF11UM0|5.0|This movie is a wonderful theatrical account of the CIA and their pursuit for Osama Bin Laden. A must see.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Kept me totally enthralled and unable to stop reading. Very thought provoking in regards to how some women may not be able to escape abusive relationships.
1250012570|4.0|It's a story of pure puppy love.<br />I really love the chemistry between Eleanor & Park and the way they build up their relationship.
B004T340QY|5.0|This is a wonderfully done movie.<br /><br />The story is funny, the music is fun, and the whole family can watch this.  I enjoyed the music so much that I bought the sound tract, and also the concert DVD, where the actual musical artists performed the music on stage. (Down From The Mountain).<br /><br />This is one of those rare movies that you can watch several times and enjoy it just as much as the first time.
B00EVRHE8E|4.0|I love the way Rowell get inside the fandom world, also Cath's college life. It's feel so real. I'm really into the story.<br />And Simon Snow fanfiction is a good job. I'm a fan of Baz/Simon now.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best Game To Ever Leave The Lab. I can honesty say that I'm absolutely addicted! No bad reviews so far, and I've been playing this for weeks.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|Anyone who looks at this will probably think what everyone thought when ther first saw it. &#34;Hey look, hasbro's cheap attempt at trying to cash out on the brony phenomena AND make a seperate toy line for little girls at the same time&#34; well yes and no. They did make a separate toy line, and most bronies will buy this. That being said does it make this film cheap? no, not at all...no way<br /><br />This movie is as well written as the show and you can tell the writers, animators, voice actors, and composers all love this series as much as the fans, and they don't want it to suck anymore than their fans do. It's got a solid story, with some small nit picky questions that aren't answered, but like i said, nit picky. The animation is great, on par with the show, and slightly better in some points. The songs are GREAT fantastic, well written and catchy as all hell. all in all a really great buy. I bought 2 just to have on for display. but yeah anyone who like MLP or if your kid's into it, pick this movie up. it's awesome I've seen it like 4 times already and it's stays solid every time.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Hell yeah!!<br />Way better than the HB0 series.<br />I can't recomed it Enuff it you like the show...<br /><br />Scar hole
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Brilliant a must for all of us....At last a book that makes sense and not the usual crap .... i have always thought the science on loosing weight didn't hold up.. too much &#34;they say&#34; and Gary says much the same .... my only complaint is perhaps to many examples, but its easy enough to skim some of these once you get the gist of it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|(: best game ever so realistic and so addicting. You will never be bored of this game. I cant put it down!
0920668372|5.0|Whoever rated this book (1) star must have not had a mother who loves them.......Best Book Ever!  My mother read this to me growing up, now my child will hear the same thing forever!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I originally believed it was a true story or based upon some true experience he had. Well written and hopefully not based upon any true event.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|It's not a deep game, but there is enough to keep intelligent people entertained for a lazy Sunday afternoon.<br /><br />Very easy to learn, takes a few minutes to pick up the rules and a couple of rounds to pick up most of the nuance. While the game is for 2-4 players it is best with 3 or 4. Two player ends up a bit predictable. Each game takes about ten minutes.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This was a  great read. Good character devopment. I enjoyed how the main charactors grew to be grandparents but started out as young idealistic kids. Reminded me of war and peace, that somehow life just keeps trudging on. I wish the German people would have had more courage and stopped the tyrants sooner. Good read and I learned alot.
B008C20TDG|4.0|A little technical but very informative. Has changed my eating habits and how I view the &#34;food&#34; I put in my mouth. Have not tried the Whole 30 yet but am seriously thinking about it. 😉
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I was a bit disappointed with sound quality of a 1:31 minute video that I watched.  Every 5 to 6 seconds it was reloading the video.  It may have something to do with the speed of the video.  I don't regret purchasing.  Will continue to check it out, hopeful with more favorable results.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Fun movie! It's not anything special. It's just a guy shoot'em up movie w some of the best action movie actors ever.
B006VREN86|4.0|'Boardwalk Empire' was created by Terence Winter. The star of the series is Steve Buscemi, who played Tony Soprano’s cousin, and he directed several episodes of 'The Sopranos'.  Martin Scorsese, is the show’s co-executive producer. Steve Buscemi comes alive as Nucky, a larger-than-life, con man, who controls Atlantic City like a Mafia boss, with his sorted array of henchmen.  Mucky does some good but it is all funded by corruption.<br /><br />Atlantic City, at the beginning of Prohibition, and women are about to gain the right to vote. Mucky is the crime boss in his city, and it is his job to keep it safe from the rest of the mobsters. Jimmy Darmody, played by Michael Pitt is  a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Nucky's, and Al Capone, played by Stephen Graham, is an up and coming mobster. Alcohol and gunfights a plenty, women of all kinds flock to Atlantic City and Nucky.<br /><br />The settings are glorious, the clothes and cars authentic, and it all adds up to one of the best shows on the air.<br /><br />Recommended. prisrob 09-16-13
B00AA0U05A|4.0|I really enjoyed this CD. It's not the best I've ever heard, nor is it the worst. I think she found a more appropriate niche for her voice than her attempt on film as Christine (for which she was very under qualified) and her first CD (for which she was very over qualified).<br /><br />The songs are, for the large part, well chosen, and she adds a charming approach to these classics. If you don't know, this is a collection of songs from the 30s and 40s. Her voice is fresh and the CD is entertaining. While I don't believe her musical attempts will create a solid vocal career, I'm glad she's making music more suited to her abilities and away from all the pop garbage.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Oh my. The reviews talked about how this book was heartfelt and get the tissues ready. I loved the characters and the perspective of Hazel. I laughed, cried and morned with the characters. It has a lot to say about life and living and overcoming the worst life can throw at you. It also lets you understand regret and how we limit ourselves with bitterness. It is not a sad story -- it is a story of young love and the characters develop in fascenating ways. I really loved it.
B009DCOU9S|1.0|I had to employ the mute button... sorry, but the voice actress's voice is grating.<br />Bad enough that I just didn't want to play.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this version tor my kindle fire. locks up sometimes but over all I really like it and use it every day. would like a bit more options for boards- how to add someone who can post is not readily evident
6305212112|5.0|Thank you very much for this one. Epic classic, now proudly owned !<br /><br />Fried Green Tomatoes is a 1991 comedy-drama film based on the novel Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe by Fannie Flagg. Directed by Jon Avnet and written by Fannie Flagg and Carol Sobieski, it stars Kathy Bates, Jessica Tandy, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Mary-Louise Parker. It tells the story of a Depression-era friendship between two women, Ruth and Idgie, and a 1980s friendship between Evelyn, a middle-aged housewife, and Ninny, an elderly woman who knew Ruth and Idgie. The centerpiece and parallel story concerns the murder of Ruth's abusive husband and the accusations that follow.<br /><br />The film received a generally positive reception from film critics and was nominated for two Academy Awards. The filmmakers drew criticism from some reviewers for removing the lesbian content of the book's plot, but the film won a GLAAD Media Award for \\"best lesbian content\\".<br /><br />Evelyn Couch (Kathy Bates), a timid, unhappy housewife in her forties, meets elderly Ninny Threadgoode (Jessica Tandy) in a Birmingham, Alabama, nursing home. Ninny, over several encounters with Evelyn, tells her the story of the now-abandoned town of Whistle Stop, Alabama, and the people who lived there. The film's subplot concerns Evelyn's dissatisfaction with her marriage and her life, her growing confidence, and her developing friendship with Ninny. The narrative switches several times between Ninny's story, which is set between World War I and World War II, and Evelyn's life in 1980s Birmingham.<br /><br />Ninny's story begins with tomboy Imogene \\"Idgie\\" Threadgoode (Mary Stuart Masterson), the youngest of the Threadgoode children, whom Ninny describes as her sister-in-law. Idgie's close relationship with her charming older brother Buddy (Chris O'Donnell) is cut short when he is hit by a train and killed. Devastated, Idgie recedes from formal society for much of her childhood and adolescence until Buddy's former girlfriend, the straitlaced Ruth Jamison (Mary-Louise Parker), intervenes at the request of the concerned Threadgoode family.<br /><br />Idgie initially resists Ruth's attempts at friendship, but then gradually allows a deep attachment to develop. Ruth leaves Whistle Stop to marry Frank Bennett (Nick Searcy) and moves to Valdosta, Georgia. Idgie is upset at losing her friend and struggles to forget her. After some time she visits Ruth, now pregnant and suffering from physical abuse from Frank. Against Frank's wishes, Ruth returns to Whistle Stop with Idgie, where her child, named Buddy Jr., is born. Papa Threadgoode gives Idgie money to start a business so she can care for Ruth and Buddy Jr. Ruth and Idgie open the Whistle Stop Cafe, employing cook Sipsey (Cicely Tyson) and her son Big George (Stan Shaw), who makes a barbecue that quickly becomes popular with their patrons.<br /><br />Frank Bennett eventually returns to Whistle Stop in an attempt to kidnap Buddy Jr., but is thwarted by an unseen assailant. Frank goes missing and his truck is later found at the bottom of a nearby lake. Idgie is immediately a suspect, as she had publicly threatened violence against him for beating Ruth. She is arrested along with Big George for Frank's murder. The local sheriff offers to release her and pin the crime solely on Big George, but Idgie refuses to sacrifice her friend. During the subsequent trial, the local minister lies, providing Idgie and Big George with an alibi for the time of Frank's disappearance. Taking into account Frank's reputation for getting drunk, the judge rules his death an accident. Idgie and Big George are cleared of all charges.<br /><br />After the trial, Ruth develops cancer and dies. Following her death, the caf&eacute; closes. Over time, many Whistle Stop residents eventually move away, bringing Ninny to the end of her story, but not before the revelation of what really happened to Frank.<br /><br />And that's where I'll stop, because I'mno spoiler!<br /><br />This is an amazing Grandparents Day gift and a true masterpiece to cinema.<br /><br />I must have received the best copy off the shelf, P.S. ..<br /><br />therefore the DVD quality in my personal experience was phenomenal.oiler!<br /><br />This is an amazing Grandparents Day gift and a true masterpiece to cinema.<br /><br />I must have received the best copy off the shelf, P.S. ..<br /><br />therefore the DVD quality in my personal experience was phenomenal.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Hard to believe this is considered one of the ten greatest sci fi books or that it won a Hugo. I struggled getting interested in the story for the first half of the book. The tone of the final chapter causes me to think OSW got tired of writing.
B00014K5TQ|5.0|I LOVE IT ! Awesome movie here.<br /><br />Party Monster is a 2003 biographical crime drama film that details the rise and fall of infamous New York party promoter Michael Alig. The film stars Macaulay Culkin as the drug-addled \\"King of the Club Kids\\".<br /><br />Written and directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato, the film is based on Disco Bloodbath, the memoir of James St. James which details his friendship with Alig, that later fell apart as Alig's drug addiction worsened, and ended after he murdered Angel Melendez and went to prison. A 1998 documentary on the murder, also called Party Monster: The Shockumentary, was used for certain elements of the film.<br /><br />Based on the book Disco Bloodbath, by James St. James, the film opens with Michael Alig as a small-town outcast who lived with his mom before moving to New York. Michael learns the New York party scene from James St. James, who teaches him the \\"rules of fabulousness\\", which mostly revolve around attracting as much attention to oneself as possible.<br /><br />Despite James' warning, Alig hosts a party at Limelight, a local club which is owned by Peter Gatien, and soon becomes the hottest club in New York, with Alig at the head. Alig is named \\"King of the Club Kids\\" and goes on a cross country journey in search of more club kids. Alig and James pick up Angel Melendez, Gitsie, and Brooke. Soon after meeting, Gitsie becomes Alig's new girlfriend. However, after Michael descends further into drug abuse, his life starts to spiral out of control, eventually culminating in his involvement in the murder of Angel. Gitsie and Michael decide to go to rehab and treat it as a \\"Second Honeymoon\\", leaving James behind. James then begins to write his \\"Great American Novel\\" published as Disco Bloodbath and later as Party Monster.<br /><br />This movie is killer .. No pun.<br /><br />I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Long live indie flicks.
