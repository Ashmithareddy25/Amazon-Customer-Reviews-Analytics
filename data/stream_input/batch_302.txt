B00008H2LB|2.0|now i admit, i am not the biggest likin park fan ever. I thought there last cd, hybrid theory, set a new page in music, combining rap, rock, electronica, and other elements to get a very new sound out. However this cd is normally supposed to be a maturation of the band, but yet, this is falling short of the goal. it will please the ears once, maybe twice, but the cd will lose it's flavor, like old gum, and it lose flavor quite rapidly. the cd has it's bright spots, but they are dim compared to the bar that was set by the last cd.
B000002UA9|5.0|Who could've seen it coming? What seemed like a routine hard day's work at Abbey Road studios eventually paid off with earth-shaking ramifications. Producer George Martin, guiding four unknowns from Liverpool, didn't see it coming. Certainly the suits at EMI, who alotted the Beatles a mere day of recording time, couldn't have foretold the future. But, here it is, the impressive results of that long, hot day of furious recording.<br />Impeccably dressed-- on orders of manager Brian Epstein-- in pressed white shirts and skinny black ties, the Fabs unleashed this raw studio tour de force of what was essentially their energetic live show. And what a show it was. \\"One, two, three, four..\\" shouts bassist Paul McCartney, before launching into a three-chord barn burner called \\"I Saw Her Standing There.\\" Honed on the sweat-soaked stages of Hamburg and Liverpool, \\"I Saw Her\\" chugs along effortlessly, riding the rhythmic thunder of newest Beatle, drummer Ringo Starr. McCartney's breathless vocal steals the show, while lead string-bender, George Harrison, cranks out a blazing Chet Atkins-style solo. Rhythm guitarist John Lennon shows off fine vocal chops on soul crooner Arthur Alexander's sultry \\"Anna\\". In fact, Lennon turns in the set's finest vocal with his flesh-tearing rendition of the Isley Brothers' 1962 hit \\"Twist and Shout\\". The most telling sign of \\"Please Please Me\\" is that eight of the LP's fourteen songs were penned by McCartney/Lennon. (Not Lennon/ McCartney to which the world would soon be accustomed.) The boys' first single, the raw \\"Love Me Do\\", rode Lennon's infectious harmonica hook all the way to # 17 on the British Pop Charts. However, \\"Love Me Do\\" proved to be a mere warm up as the brilliant, uptempo title track surged to the coveted # 1 slot. Cloaked in an unforgettable refrain with a trademark Lennon and McCartney duet, \\"Please Please Me\\", is pure textbook hit songwriting. Everything about the track-- the expertly executed rhythmic shifts, hooky guitar riff and repeated shouts of \\"Oh Yeah\\"-- exhibited hints of pure genius which would dominate the rock world for seven years. But, still, no one could have seen what lied ahead. \\"Please Please Me\\" is the beginning of the greatest musical journey of the 20th Century.
B00005T5YK|5.0|Not only is the music a 5+, but the DVD-A surround mix and sound quality is one of the best out there.  Much better than even the recent stereo remasters and many other DVD-A discs available.  This breathes new life into an already classic album.  The original producer did an outstanding job on the DVD-A 5.1 mix.  DVD-A lives up to its hype on this one.

B00005B5L4|5.0|The music is still incredible, but .... Now I couldn't give Rumours anything less than the best score, but I have to say, the DVD-A mix is a little uneven among the songs.  I waited in great anticipation to play the DVD-A version once I finally had my new home theater system set up including my brand new Pioneer-45A (DVD-A,SACD combo player).<br />While the majority of mixes are really good, I was really disappointed with &quot;Go Your Own Way.&quot;  The vocals sound distant (they should be up front), somewhat reminiscent of &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; where the vocals are supposed to sound a little distant. Also, the driving punch of the Mick Fleetwood's drums is missing.  In fact, when you hear the drums on GYOW, they sound distant and boomy.  On &quot;You Make Loving Fun,&quot;  Christine McVie's vocals seem to get overwhelmed by the music.  Here the punch of the drums seems too much.  There's something wrong with &quot;Second Hand News&quot; too, but it's hard to describe.<br />On the good side, &quot;Dreams&quot; has a nice warm feel to it.  &quot;Oh Daddy,&quot; which I never really liked until now, sounds fantastic in the 5.1 mix.  The 5.1 mix for &quot;Silver Springs&quot; is also done very nicely with the acoustic guitar set in the rear speakers.  The remaining songs are mixed okay too.<br />If you really want to hear how good a DVD-A mix can be done, check out the Eagles' Hotel California.  It will leave you wanting another remix of the Rumours DVD-A.

B000000OAH|5.0|At this point, Queen were on the verge of another makeover: this time toward a more funk/pop phase which was slightly hinted at here, but taken up even more on the next two albums following this one: _The Game_ and _Hot Space_ (excluding the Flash Gordon soundtrack.)<br />It seems that this album gets pretty mixed reviews from diehard Queen fans, and more casual ones. My opinion of the album? I tend to agree with both sides of the camp. I'm going to get to the negative stuff first, just to get it out of the way.<br />While I think it's a great album, I can't help feeling that some of it seems a bit lackluster, uninspired and forced for Queen's own typical high standards, particularly during the second half. First off, the album seems a bit uneven, mainly because the hard-hitting and upbeat numbers seem to play out consecutively throughout the first half, while the second half seems more subdued in dynamics and atmosphere. Listening to the transition from a (mostly) first half of upbeat numbers to a (mostly) second half of low-key numbers can be quite a tough pill to swallow for a listener. It probably would have been nicer if the track order was switched around and mixed up more, like they did on the majority of their earlier 70s albums. All of this gives the impression that Queen got a bit hasty and careless with the production of the album, as if they were on a quick deadline to release an album within a short period of time. The overall feel of the album comes across as a bit sloppily executed, when in fact Queen were one of THE bands/producers known for their precision, meticulousness and perfectionism.<br />Queen fans will probably want to see me fry in hell for all of these last comments, but Queen is only my all-time favorite band, and I say all of this because Queen were a band who set high standards for themselves, and it's hard not to notice when they've stepped down a bit.<br />Now the goods. This is definitely a fun (and elegant) album to listen to, especially when you're in need of a good cheer-up. Hard to not feel good after listening to the sensuous, lusty and jovial/celebratory vocals of Freddie Mercury, the hypnotic crunch of Brian's self-made guitar, the bombastic drumming of Roger Talyor and John Deacon's tasty basslines backing it all up. \\"Mustapha\\" is an Arabic-like number with Freddie singing mostly wordless (but hypnotic and engrossing) vocal lines which give the track an almost spiritual aura. The musicianship is intelligent and top-notch here as well. \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" many probably know. \\"Jealousy\\" is an excellent number featuring Brian May playing some guitar lines that sound almost eastern. Freddie's vocals as always are convincing. \\"Bicycle Race\\" shows off the kind of perfectionism and meticulousness Queen were known for perfectly: a number with a sheer amount of complexity crammed throughout it's short playing time. I always loved how Queen made tracks that sounded like \\"many songs played within a single song.\\" They managed to make their complex musical point in quarter time of what most classic progressive rockers did, which puts the latter to shame. The intelligent chords & progressions, the abrupt switches in dynamics and other factors give this track an almost symphonic quality, as it plays out like an almost ultra-quick symphony - and not to mention those ultra-classy vocal harmonies soaked throughout. During the second half of the track, Brian May manages to slip in some licks based on ionian scales for three different keys - all of which are in ascending mode. This also adds to the \\"symphonic\\" quality the track possesses.<br />\\"Let Me Entertain You\\" and \\"Dead On Time\\" are hard-hitters in the Queen tradition. The former features some fairly risqu&eacute; lyrics, with some of Freddie's more expressive vocals, while the latter seems to return to the proto-speed metal that Queen pretty much pioneered with \\"Stone Cold Crazy,\\" particularly in Brian May's frenzied riffing. This track is somewhat scary, as well as exciting. \\"In Only Seven Days\\" is a fairly low-key number written by bassist John Deacon. Features some wispy orchestration (nope, Queen didn't use synths - mostly Brian's guitar) and Freddie gives an elegant and sexy vocal performance. \\"Dreamer's Ball\\" mixes lounge jazz and Renaissance attributes - the latter in an irreverent, inorganic fashion (reminds me a bit of Gentle Giant.) \\"Fun It\\" gives the hint of things to come on later albums, as it's a funk/disco track. \\"Leaving Home Ain't Easy\\" is a nice ballad with a nice use of Brian May's gentle vocals. \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\" is just downright exciting and sophisticated. \\"More Of That Jazz\\" is a mid-tempo rocker featuring some scorching guitar licks. There's a part near the end of the track where you get a recap of the album, as you hear quick bits of a few tracks spliced together for an almost mind-warping remix.<br />The uneven feel of the album is the only real flaw, which causes me to take off 1/2 star from the 5 scale, but on the whole, the strengths outweigh the flaws by a longshot, as the songwriting and musicianship are still strong.scary, as well as exciting. \\"In Only Seven Days\\" is a fairly low-key number written by bassist John Deacon.

B00006RU5B|5.0|This is a good cd.  It's an interesting combination of rage minus de la roche plus cornell.  It's definitely not rage, but Morello's solos rip through the tracks, and they just sound cool.  In my opinion that's the best part of the cd.
0064407667|5.0|My seven year old and I are reading the S of UE series.  I've read some of the reviews posted here with dismay!  I have found the writing very intellegent.  The stories are compelling and the author's use of complex and rich vocubulary is refreshing.<br />Neither my daughter or I find the stories depressing.  It would be like saying &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; or &quot;Bugs Bunny&quot; was depressing just because bad things happen in those cartoons.  The events that happen are so outlandish that no one but the most closed minded could possibly take them seriously.  My daughter loves the stories and understands that they are pretend. <br />The three children characters are resourceful, they stick together as a family unit, and they don't give up.  Even though bad things are happening to them, they don't do bad things to others.  <br />Don't take the stories seriously, just enjoy and I think you'll find a series that is a great read together opportunity.
B00008H2LE|5.0|All I have to say is that I love Linkin Park after hearing their 2nd album.  I loved them before but it's just more official now.  I didn't think that I would like their 2nd cd because usually that's how it is for most artist.  They didn't necessarily top Hybrid but they have proven themselves.
B0000026VZ|3.0|A Toto fan since \\"The Seventh One\\" came out in 1988, I have heard and own all of their albums up to and including this one. <br /><BR>In my opinion, this is not a very good collection of their music. There were much better songs that could have been added to this collection, and a couple of these songs probably should have been left off. Not to mention that the CD does not \\"flow\\" well. For example, the first 2 tracks are \\"Love Has the Power\\" and \\"Africa\\" and they go well together. But then the next track is \\"Hold the Line\\" which has their old late 70's rock sound to it. The clash of style is noticeable. There are other such examples. Seems as though they could have done a better job arranging the order of songs on the album. And the track \\"Georgie Porgy\\" which I have never liked, probably should have been left off the album, or at least put it in order w/\\"Hold the Line\\" - it seems sorely out of place! <br /><BR>If you are looking for a good Toto album to buy, save your money on this one, and pick up \\"Toto IV\\" or \\"The Seventh One\\" - most of the songs from this collection are off those 2 albums anyway, and both of those are excellent! 2 of the new cuts on this CD, \\"Love Has the Power\\" and \\"Out of Love\\" are pretty good, but \\"Can You Hear What I'm Saying\\" and \\"Animal\\" stink! I think that they really should do two seperate greatest hits albums: one with the older rock sounds (not my favorite stuff of theirs, but others seem to like it) and then one with the pop hits and ballads.
B000003TAW|5.0|This cd is awesome.  Just as the other reviews mentioned, it's hard to classify them.  That's because they play what they feel, and it sounds good.  They're just fun songs.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Wow.  It's about time that movies actually starred talented people.  I was amazed with how great this film and soundtrack are.  The music in CHICAGO is fun, upbeat and every time you listen to it, you get the sudden urge to do the Charleston.  Zeta-Jones, Gere, Zellweger, Reilly, Latifah and the rest of the cast do an outstanding job at bringing this musical to life.  It's wonderful to see actors/actresses who are so multi-talented do well, so I encourage EVERYONE to either buy the soundtrack or see the movie... trust me, it won't be a chore. :)
B0000035E7|3.0|Bleach is by no means a \\"good\\" album, it is also by no means a \\"bad\\" album.  How much you like this album depends on a few things:<BR>1) How devoted you are to Nirvana, the space between Bleach and Nevermind shows almost inhuman growth.<BR>2) You love of screech metal Kurt never quite was a powerful vocalist, but he can growl and screech, and believe me, he will <BR>and finally 3) your trash tolerance  just how much thrash metal can you stomach?<BR>Bleach is listenable for a while, but it quickly spirals into random noise.  Deffinitly not Nirvana's best, but okay for a listen ...
B00000J7JO|5.0|This album is truly great.  It's like a mix of all the different sounds the chili peppers have had over the years.  Some are more rock ballad type songs, others, like around the world, have more of their classic funk rock sound.  It is of course tuned down a little more than before, such as in BSSM.  If you're looking for chili pepper funk, buy BSSM.  But this is a great album, and I fear it will be their last after listening to by the way.
B00008GKEG|5.0|BRAVO!..BRAVO!..BRAVO! What a masterpiece. Rare and extensive concert footage, interviews, detailed and often humorous recollections from the fab four, etc...etc... If you are a die hard Beatles fan, or just a new listener who wants to know all about the group, this DVD set is a MUST. No Beatle collection, big or small, is \\"compleat\\" without this. <BR>I just wish this box set was around in video form twenty three years ago when most young people still knew who the Beatles were and John Lennon was still alive. I believe it would have been the biggest video seller in history back then, generated so much new interest, and just maybe that could have prompted a Beatles reunion?? What took so long for all this great footage to surface? <BR>If you like the Beatles, you will feel you know them personally after seeing this. Just buy it and enjoy it.

0399132635|1.0|If you're a fan of thoughtful books, stay away from this one.  It's ludicrous.  Everyone in it is independently wealthy and has nothing better to do than to run around and get into adventures.  The dog is overdone, the love story is [bad], the story is overlong, the baboon is just stupid.  The only reason I finished it?  I HAD to for an English course I took in Horror.  Read Richard Matheson if you like Koontz's style.  He's a ton better.
0525457585|5.0|When I got my copy of the \\"Neverending Story\\" in last week, I dove for it right away. I had been dying to read it forever. But it's not what was in it that first grabbed my attention. The print is in two different colors: a beautiful maroon for stories relating to the Human world, and a vivid emerald for anything relating to Fantasia. Furthermore, each chapter begins with a full-page with a single letter on it. (The first chapter \\"A\\", the last chapter \\"Z,\\" you get the idea). Add that to the beautiful cover and simple, yet detailed illustrations, and you have one of the best put-together books ever written.<br />Now, on to the actual story. \\"The NeverEnding Story\\" tells the story of Bastian Balthaazar Bux, an outcast trying to get over the shock of losing his mother. One morning, while running from the local bullies, he ducks into a bookstore. He finds a book there that literally calls out to him. Even though his conscience tries to dissuede him, he steals the book and has the urge to read it right away! What he finds in the book is an adventure most unlike any of the others he is used to finding in books. Things seem SO real! He can practically SEE each character, SMELL the earth, TASTE the seedcakes, HEAR the wind, and FEEL the cold. As things go along, he knows it is silly, but he somehow feels a part of the NeverEnding story....<br />Although this book was written in the 1980's, it has definitely stood the test of time. Michael Ende proves himself as one of the top fantasy writers. Like Bastian, you can almost imagine you are there. If you love books like \\"Chronicles of Narnia,\\" \\"Harry Potter,\\" and \\"The Princess Bride,\\" PLEASE do yourself a favor and read this book!

B00005QGAT|5.0|One of the greatest things about Michael Jackson is his versatility. Also I think his fame is a symptom of the strangeness that surrounds him. He's not going to be a &quot;normal&quot; person by the standards by which we measure others.

B00008H2LB|3.0|It's not THAT bad...<br />I'm not too big on Linkin Park, but it's funny how I read all these 1 star reviews on this album, and I have yet to see WHY people hate them, it's seems to be the same message over and over again with these 1 star reviews - and that is, expressing there opinionated-rage about their beef against mainstream music, which holds no value for an arguement (music is music, get over it). <br />While I myself don't feel to be a die-hard Linkin Park fan, I will say that I roughly enjoyed this album. I think others would feel the same way if they just open there minds. But instead, most people have this mental block for things they see on MTV. Big deal. I think one of the big +'s about Linkin Park is they CAN appeal to a wider audience (not saying they do). If you understand hip-hop, you will understand that Linkin Park's MC is actually quite good, and can flow very well. The singer Chester can scream quite intensly, and has proven with \\"Breaking the Habit\\" that he can sing well. Is he the best singer in rock? No, but he CAN sing. Anyone who thinks otherwise is in simple denile.<br />I think the biggest problem with this CD is it feels rushed in some songs. It took them 3 years to come out with 36 min worth of music? Not very impressive. I think the Intro is very weak as well. 13 secs of typical movie sounds. The point to an intro is to capture the mood for the rest of the album, this fails to do that in my opinion. So therefore, it's a waste of space on the CD.<br />In the positive scope of this album, I will say although a lot of the lyrics are whiney, it's still relatable, because every human being goes through the things that these guys talk about. It's very general and I think thats another reason why they have such a wide fan base. In my opinion, good lyrics is all about keeping it real, and speaking your mind. That's what these guys do - I feel these guys arn't faking anything, like rappers do. <BR>Some of beats on here are quite tight as well.\\"Faint\\" is my favorite track, leaning towards the hip-hop side. The DJ work on this CD is well thought-out. Linkin Park's DJ is good. The guitar is extremly basic, so metal heads will automatically dis-miss the guitar work, because it sounds nothing like Adam Jones or Tom Morello. Shame. Complexity shouldn't mean anything anymore. Music should be appealing to the ears, and Linkin Park does this (8 million ears listened, that IS appealing) So if this includes simple guitar riffs and strums, so be it. <br />All in all, I don't think Linkin Park is the best thing in Rock today, but they are certainly NOT this \\"horrible, corporate, mainstream, MTV, teen popin' band\\" that some of these people make them out to be. Grow up - Linkin Park is keeping it real, and that's something thats rare in music nowadays.

B00005JKQZ|5.0|Whethor Russel Crowe is an idiot in person, or not has no bearing on his acting abilities, and they are quite superb.  All of the acting in this movie are done very tastefully and believably.  The story is incomplete, because it is based on a true story, but it does not seem like that if you watch it unknowingly.  <BR>    The story concentrates on the life of John Nash, a genius, who suffers from schizophrenia, and how he overcomes his hallucinations.  It is truly inspirational.
6303184499|3.0|There was a time when movies were slicker than they are now, when they pushed the buttons of sexuality/abhorrent sex.  This is a lot about voyeurism and the thrill of being stalked.  Sharon Stone was of course capitalizing on the Basic Instinct success.  Billy Baldwin is very attarctive and they make a sexy couple but it didn't make a good movie.  The soundtrack is amazing though!

0930289234|5.0|This is a good book.  Most people say that.  What works best at the heart of this book is how labor intensive it is.  It would be nice to see this kind of treatment turned onto say the XMen.

6304681496|4.0|Although a lot of people may view 'Con Air' as average, I think there's many aspects that make it a great all-around movie. Still, there are a few details that keep it from being perfect. For instance, the accent that Nicolas Cage uses is absolutely horrible. The fact that his voice is so bad even takes away from the fact his hair is annoyingly long. And had Nicolas not been supported by the actors John Malkovich and John Cusack, it would've been a nightmare. Malkovich is particularly enjoyable as he plays the \\"bad\\" bad guy; Cage is a criminal in the movie, but he's wrongfully accused. There's also great appearances by Steve Buscemi, Dave Chappelle, and Ving Rhames; all as convicted felons. Many Buscemi enthusiasts will say this film features his best role. And that's with good reason. You have to see his character to believe it.<br />Here Cage plays Cameron Poe, who as I said, was convicted under false pretenses. As he's traveling on a plane filled with criminal after criminal, the character of Cyrus \\"the Virus\\" (Malkovich) and co. begin to take over the plane. If you think it sounds stupid, it's really not. Poe sums it up perfectly in saying they managed to get every bad criminal in the world onto one plane. Even though it seems to be a far-fetched cry for originality, it works well for the movie. On a down note, they (the director) never really clue us into how the plane was hijacked. It just sort of happens. There's no real plan, and it's basically through force and violence. It's really a weak script, but the acting of the individuals and as a group make up for that. I don't want to spoil anything for you, so I won't say much more. Once the group takes control of the aircraft, they obviously plan to head to Mexico (this is very clich&eacute;). Another person who helps add appeal to 'Con Air' is Monica Potter. She plays the wife of Poe; and even though her role is rather small, it's one of the best. This probably helped boost her career and get her roles in both 'Along Came A Spider' and 'Patch Adams'. She plays the part of a apprehensive wife (with a child who's never seen her father) to complete perfection. As I have said I won't ruin anything else for you, I won't ruin the ending either. But I will say it was a very poor ending. If it weren't for the ending, this would have been a 5-star movie. I have a hard time understanding how other reviewers could enjoy the ending to that great of an extent. Even so it's not terrible, yet it's nothing to write home about.<br />At the end of the day, this movie is definitely worth watching. A lot of Nicolas Cage fans will probably love this movie; maybe even say it's their favorite. 'Con Air' sits at #28 on my listmania list for my top 100 movies of all-time; and it's slightly better than 'The Rock'. Don't let my views on the end or Cage's voice lead you to believe this is not a great movie, because it is. The cast is one of the best I've ever seen in an action movie. Many of the characters bring their own assortment of jokes and/or seriousness to the film. Mainly Steve Buscemi; whose role here makes this an essential for his many fans. There are certainly some parts that don't allow this movie to be 5 stars. But on the other hand, there are certainly countless aspects that make it better than just four; I'd label 'Con Air' as a 4.25-star movie. If you enjoy action, you'll enjoy this movie.g Came A Spider' and 'Patch Adams'. She plays the part of a apprehensive wife (with a child who's never seen her father) to complete perfection.

B00005QGAV|5.0|One of the greatest things about Michael Jackson is his versatility. Also I think his fame is a symptom of the strangeness that surrounds him. He's not going to be a &quot;normal&quot; person by the standards by which we measure others. And I think the fault of most people is that they try to look at him as being someone who should be logically accessible as well in our concepts of our own worlds. I really liked this cd and recommend this highly for the beats.
B000001DTM|4.0|Although \\"One\\", \\"Stay\\" and couple of other powerful dance-floor-kind tracks jam-packed in this album, I have to say that this is not the best of all U2 albums like many other fans have voted. Of all the albums I've listened to over and over throughout the past few years since I've ever become a die-hard U2 fan, many of my favorite tracks are off from their early albums. \\"Wide Awake in America\\", \\"Rattle and Hum\\", \\"War\\", \\"Joshua Tree\\". Get ready for their next \\"heavy\\" Rockin' Album!
B00006JL1Z|3.0|Fleetwood Mac's classic lineup (Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, Christine McVie, John McVie and Mick Fleetwood) was one of the best pop/rock acts of the 70's and 80's.  There is plenty of great material on the this latest complilation; however, there is the overall feeling that this two disc issue was padded with quite a bit of mediocre to poor material.  The song order was also not well selected.  For example, you can find almost all of the songs from the classic Rumours album, but they are scattered randomly over two discs which contain too many obscure songs from Tusk, too many inferior live songs from The Dance and not enough songs from the underappreciated Mirage album.  It would have made more sense to put together a single disc compilation with more judicious choosing of songs.  The double disc format simply clutters up the good material.
B000001FS6|5.0|Yeah, like many many other fans &quot;complaining&quot; about this album, quite the contrary, I liked this one very much. The main reason is this is a LIVE album which what U2 is for - they are one of the greatest live stadium rock band in the world. Of many great tracks on this album, I particularly love &quot;God, pt2&quot;. Larry's drum beats really stands out on this track and makes it a great rock'n'roll sound-bite.<br />This CD has been in my CD player everyday for 2 months now - it has pretty good rotation here. I really don't care if U2 has done too much or too little, polically or not, as long as they keep producing great rock anthems, I'll be forever happy.<br /><br />I just hope they'll make another concert album - the most recent one &quot;Live from Boston&quot; should be good enough. I find that many songs sounded so much better in live than their studio production.
0393312836|3.0|A Clockwork Orange <BR>     A Clockwork Orange takes place in England and was written by, Anthony Burgess, in 1962.  The story is about this boy that is growing up in England, living with his parents by day and trying to rule the streets by night.  The main character is named Alex and at night he rules the streets with his gang(droogs) causing chaos.  He loves to get his hand on money or pretty poly as he refers to it.  They have there own slang terms like rook which is hand and he uses the term, \\"O Brothers,\\" numerous times.  At night he would go around robbing people and taking part in violent acts.  Alex's dad suspected something when Alex brought home a lot of cash but, never accused Alex of anything.  One night while the droogs were taking part in these violent acts, the cops finally caught up with them.  Alex went to jail for the crimes that he had committed and was locked up at the age of fifteen.  Jail didn't do him any good.  There he even tried to fool the system by getting out early, but he wasn't ready to face the consequences of his actions.  There he under went a detox experiment, only they weren't taking the alcohol out of him but, the violent side of him and trying to make him more humain in society.  They finally release him back into society but he had nowhere to go and his family didn't really want him.  There he went back onto the streets of England.<BR>          I recommend this book because it settles all the hype that you hear about it but, I thought it would have been better than people said it was.  I've heard people say that this book was too gross for them to read and it gives them goose bumps but, it's all hype.  This book isn't as bad, if not less intense, as any movie out today.  I don't think this book should have even been band in the sixties because it not really that vulger.  This book was ok to read yet, it had its slower parts.  I think the best thing about this book was that you kind of had to decode some of the phrases that Alexwas trying to say.  This book reminds me of a Shakespeare play, in that the langue is hard to understand.  Unlike Shakespeare, you don't have to decode every line word for word, for the book to make sense. After a while you get a feeling for the langue that Alex's uses.  This is what I like about the novel, trying to figure out what the character was trying to say.  This made the novel better than it might have been.  If they had this choice of books in high school, I would have rather read a book of this nature,to prepare me for novels like Mac Beth.  If you think that you are going to read a novel filled with acts that are unheard, then maybe you should read another book.  There is only one major shocker when he breaks into this ladies home after playing a nasty trick on her.  This is a type of book that you should read through a second time to get the whole story, and to understand it completely.  My thoughts were that this book was going to be a type of story that was taboo but, it was about as bad as brutal as someone getting mug, which happens everyday.  Over all I would have to rate this book a five because I feel it didn't live up to the magnification
B000088E6D|5.0|I am glad to hear that the swing and jazz music is coming back, I am a 21 year old young woman and I simply melt everytime I hear this music! And Michael, so far, is the best I've heard! His soft voice and charming smile brings back what only the rat pack could do!
B00005QG9J|4.0|Incubus isn't your run of the mill hard rock band, they get played on the radio a lot (AHHHHH) and their sound is pretty unique. I enjoyed this CD so here's my track by track review of it.<BR>Nice to Know You-One of the singles, not good until the chorus. 4/5<BR>Circles-One of the most metal songs on the album, second favorite. 4/5<BR>Wish You Here-Alright I'll admit it I really like this song, it's very catchy and has a good beat to it. 5/5<BR>Just A Phase-I almost threw this CD out after this song! 2/5<BR>11am-See above just make it worse. 1/5<BR>Bllod on the Ground-Finally the album turns around and becomes a good CD again. Very powerful track. 5/5<BR>Mexico-Calm acoustic track, definatly needed. 5/5<BR>Warning-Another single, good. 4/5<BR>Echo-Ehhh. 3/5<BR>Have You Ever-Favorite track on the whole CD, very enjoyable hard rock track! 7/5<BR>Are You In?-Seems repetative, but not bad. 4/5<BR>Under My Umbrella-Good, very catchy, funky bass and chorus. 5/5<BR>Aqueous Tramsmission-Longest track on the whole album, good closer. 5/5<BR>Incubus is a pretty good band, check them out, you might love them or you might just want to burn everyone of their CDs ever produced, just give them a try.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I just bootlegged their cd today, and let me tell you, its great. Similiar to hybrid theory but with alittle mroe experimentation with sounds.  Some of the songs sound like the songs on Hybrid Theory. This is the cd that Reanimation should hav been. excellent!
B00008J4P5|5.0|Keeping this to the point, I'm not one to purchase CD's very often and I don't really know much about this band.  After hearing their title track from this new album &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;, I was hooked.  After going to a local retail store on its release date and finding the album sold out already after just a few hours, I knew I was in for something special.<br />I can't quite put my finger on it as to why this CD is so good, but it is.  Not only does it have a different feel than everything else out their today, it is what a real band sounds like...great lyrics and a great sound.
B00008H2LB|4.0|This album DID show progression from Hybrid Theory.  The production, sampling, and beats sound better and more original than Hybrid Theory.  When I listen to the album I cant do it just once.  I play it about two or three times through.  Every song is great, only wish we could have gotten a little more music (36min is it) from these guys.  If you liked them before you will like them even more.
0131103628|4.0|For some reason, this book was assigned to one of my intro to comp-sci classes.  It definitely does not fit such profile as it provides a great overview of the language, how it's built, how it works, and its applications, however, it does not teach to program.  If you already know the basics of programming and are proficient in a similar language (e.g. Java), this may be an interesting read to understand the workings of the C language, but by no means expect it to provide little &quot;classes&quot; to teach you to be a C programmer.<BR><br />Good overview of the language, targetted at more advanced programmers.
B00006L9ZT|2.0|Frankly, I had high hopes for this set before it was released, because I very much prefer a traditional staging of Wagner's great work than those gimmicky productions that we're now accustomed in the opera house.<br />Unfortunately, this set does not live up to expectations. One of the major reasons is that the performances captured here have been very unevely cast. Some of the singers are distinctly below their best and some (like Behrens's Brunnhilde) shouldn't have been singing their roles at all. <br />Another reason for my disappointment arises from the conducting of Levine, which I found to be lethargic and dramatically stunted. The orchestra performed very well, though. But as an interpretation, it lacks fire and drama. <br />The production loses much of its grandeur when viewed through a home TV (unless one has a very large and wide-screen TV set), and the stage direction is merely dutiful. Some of the stage effects are also too much subdued.<br />I'll award this set 2 stars.
B000000OQF|5.0|In early 1988 I was a sheltered 16 year old who only bought music on a very rare occasion. One day at school i was talking to a guy who had just seen GnR open for Iron Maiden. He said this is going to be a great band. When i first heard Sweet Child o Mine i was hooked. I went out and bought the album, started listening to it and have never looked back. From the start of Welcome to the Jungle to Rocket Queen this album has gotten me through every situation (good and bad) i have ever encounered. I have purchesed two cds and at least 4 cassettes because I have worn them out. I take this album with me where ever i go. This is a must for any music collection.
B00005JKMQ|1.0|Word-of-mouth is true about this one.  This movie is a bummer.  It's just Will Smith playing Will Smith, but he almost had the voice down. But he would lose the voice occasionally. The fight scenes are uninteresting.  Will Smith looked as if he was scared of a stunt punch.  Unlike the real Muhammand Ali in those days.  Perhaps Laurence Fishburne should have been cast as Ali.  No magic or drama to this film.  I recommend the original film that Muhammand Ali made on his life story starring Muhammand Ali himself, THE GREATEST (1977).  Muhammand Ali was also good in FREEDOM ROAD (1979-TVM).
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I rented it and watched it 5 times in 2 days. Every time I watched it, it got about ten times deeper, and saw something new in it every time. Unusual for me, but I had it stuck in my mind for days afterward.<BR>I don't think you could even understand the movie after only watching it once, though I thought I did the first time.
B00003JRCQ|3.0|First of all, if you haven't read this book, I strongly recommend that you DO NOT see this movie.  I don't think it would give you a very good impression of what is one of my favorite books.  The pacing is wrong, it  manages to jump around and drag on seemingly without going anywhere at the same time.  I also think that they expect you to infer quite a bit about the characters and events prior to the movie, but don't do a very good job of setting them up.  Also, the sound quality of the dialogue isn't very good. Basically, if you don't already care about the characters, you still won't; if you don't already have some idea of the plot, it will be confusing and move incredibly slowly.  <br />If you have already read the book, I would suggest seeing this movie, it is a decent adaptation (not as good as both recent Emmas and the most recent P&amp;P, but to each their own).  As far as I can remember, the two most major changes made were that the alternate ending (Wentworth speaking on the behalf of the Admiral regarding Kellynch) was added, and Mrs. Smith's story was changed to be much, much shorter and more straightforward.  I think that both of these changes worked fairly well.  What I couldn't stand about this version was its drab personality and horrible miscastings.  Ciaran Hinds plays a dull (and unattractive) Capt. Wenworth.  Amana Root is almost always too passive and serious as Anne (why is she such a good companion? why does everyone like her so much?) and spends half the movie staring sad and confused into the camera.  She never gets her second &quot;bloom&quot; either.  Mrs. Smith is laughably goofy.  Elizabeth slouches and chews loudly and snorts and isn't at all elegant.  Still, I think the Musgroves and Crofts are played well, as are Harville and Benwick.  Also, the letter scene was completely ruined for me...they both read it aloud, but not perfectly in unison.  <br />Overall, I gave this movie three stars because even though it's not done at all how I picture it, and is very unclear in parts, it still tells the story faithfully for those who have read it, and it's such a great story....for all of its shortcomings I've still seen this 3 times.
B0000640SA|5.0|everyone should see this movie. Life is all about a sense of purpose.
B000060P79|5.0|If you're the kind of person who likes a pop-rock kind of thing, Simple Plan would be the perfect cd for you to get! I couldn't stop listening to the cd, and it just gets you hooked. Even if i listened to the whole cd a few times in a row, i never get sick of it. All of the songs have a great beat, and the lyrics are also cool.  You wouldn't want to miss this cd by Simple Plan!
B00005JLSE|5.0|To anyone who disliked this movie, there is something definitely wrong with you.  The singing, dancing, and acting by everyone in this production was amazing and shows just how flexible actors can be.  My favorite performance was by Catherine Zeta-Jones as the villainous Velma Kelley.  She absolutely [was great] and she definitely deserved the Best Supporting Actress at the Academy Awards.  Renee Zellweger as Roxie Hart, Richard Gere as Billy Flynn, Queen Latifah as Matron Mama Morton, and Peter C. Reilly as Amos Hart all perform wonderfully and bring their characters to life.  Rob Marshall did an excellent job of adapting this show for the screen by having the musical numbers exist only in Roxie Hart's mind.  It deserved every award it got and deserved even more awards at the Oscars.  It is a must-see movie for everyone!
0345350499|5.0|Once started, \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" is so totally captivating it is very hard to put aside. This isn't the subject matter I would normally choose to read, however, this book was \\"forcibly\\" loaned to me and so my obligation was to read it.(lol) And, I am very glad that I did.<br />Having never read a King Arthur book, and not being very familiar with the history, I am glad it was Marion Zimmer Bradley's \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" that filled the gap.<br />The magic in the story brings the Harry Potter books to mind. For example, the raising of the mist on the lake reminded me of Harry Potter and his friends boarding the train at platform     9 3/4.<br />Religious differences remind me of today's reality and make me wonder about what has been learned, or not learned, over the years.<br />There are several sexual encounters, for different motives, all which are important to the story.<br />The women in \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" are very strong. They have responsible and powerful roles which are dynamically presented.<br />From this book I learned some history, thoroughly enjoyed the magic, was reminded of ever present religious differences, saw Woman Power in action, and much more.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This review is just a reply to the review of The Grouchy Reviewer. For a person who likes Kylie Minogue you shouldn't even bother writing a review for Norah. Her CD is just great, any person with a little bit of taste would agree. No offence to other Kylie Minogue fans, but only mentally challenged people would call her CD a classic.
B00008DDXC|5.0|I would have to say this 2nd feature in the series is much prefered and more enjoyable than the 1st. One reason for this, i believe is the 2nd feature gets to skip all the explanatory and expository stuff in the 1st and jumps right into the storyline. One minor annoyance-the way Dobby keeps abusing himself in his 1st encounter with Harry. The flying car is kinda corny but kinda cool, and its good to see all the \\"Potterites\\" back where they belong at Hogwart's. (Even that dispicable Malfoy)
B00008MNYS|5.0|Its amazing to me how this man has not gotten HUGE in the US. He's as big as they come in Europe, has the looks, the talent, the personality. He also puts on incredible shows, makes groundbreaking and somewhat controversial videos. His sucess has shown in many forms as his last cd of standards by the likes of Bobby Darin and Frank Sinatra, and even a number 1 song in England with Nicole Kidman! His first CD THE EGO HAS LANDED was picked as the best cd of 1999 by Rolling Stone magazine.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited away, is most certainly the best animation i have seen, and quite possibly, the best movie aswell. No one other animation producer/directors can even hold a candle to Miyazaki. Miyazaki's films use about 100 animators hand drawing each frame of the film, the result is the inevitability of a magical, strange, and most certainly beautiful visual. Not only is the film a wonderful feast for the eyes, it is also a quite amazing story, which is a 12 course meal for the mind. You may think what does this sixteen year old know about good movies, and maybe i dont know anything, but i can give reference to other movies i would put at the top with Spirited Away:<BR>             Donnie Darko, Happy Accidents, Office Space, Requium For A            Dream, and Pulf Fiction. <BR> I consider these all very good movies, and if you havent seen them you could consider them good rentals next time you take a trip to the movie rental place. Any way Spirited Away is definatly a great movie, and i am confused how anyone could say otherwise,even if 2 or 3 of the scenes gave their little four year old a shutter.
B00005JLSE|5.0|This movie was excellent, I was not a musically inclined person before seeing this, but now I am looking forward to the next musical made movie. Bravo!
B00008H2LB|5.0|I love this album, it is so much better (in my opinion)than Hybrid Theory. I don't know what u people didn't like in the album. It's good, and it sounds good. I bought this cd with the Good Charlotte cd, and ever since I have heard this album over and over. Not even bothering to look at or to listen to Good Charlotte's cd. It has a really nice beat. Especially the tracks called &quot;Faint&quot; and &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot;. That song &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot; has a very rare sound. and it's wayyy different.The Japanese flute gives the song a push.If this album isn't a good album, then how come it's become #1 in 14 countries, including the U.S.A.? Anyway, it's a great album, and I recomend it all the way. If you liked the first one, than your going to like this one.
B00008MNYS|5.0|This is quite possibly the weirdest thing.  First, the album is great. However, the &quot;hidden track&quot; after &quot;Nan's Song&quot; contains some interesting lyrics.  Robbie clearly sings, &quot;Did Jeff Hurst really score&quot;.......this is very interesting because my friends name IS Jeff Hurst, and actually about two months ago he got laid for the VERY first time......PLUS everyone who knows Jeff had been making fun of him because he could never get laid, making Robbie's lyrics that much more appropriate.  I am 100% not lieing at all about this.  I would like to know who Robbie is singing about.  p.s.....Jeff really did score.<br />p.p.s.   If anyone can get me in touch with Mr. Williams that would be appreciated.  I'm really really serious about this.  There is a Jeff Hurst.  He is a very good friend of mine.
0671027344|5.0|A Review by Amy<br />Charlie writes to an anonymous reader about his daily life of how his life is and becomes. Charlie goes through a lot of different events of is first year at high school. Charlie runs into drugs, alcohol, smoking, sex , teen pregnancy, aloneness, abuse and a lot more. But then Charlie also runs into great things as well friendship, first dates and being apart of something instead of just watching. Charlie shares is good times and bad times and his most deepest thoughts in this letters to someone he doesn't know. <BR>I really enjoyed this book a lot! What I liked about it was that the author created real teen scenarios. For an example peer pressure caused Charlie to start smoking. I found a lot of these scenarios I could see happening to a lot of people. Another part of this book I loved was the author wrote it really well so that reader would get involved with the story. For an example when he had feelings towards Sam and didn't tell her I just wanted to tell him that he should tell her! Another really good part about this book was that the author made you always guessing what is going to happen next? Like when Charlie came home one night after a party and was writing all weird I just wonder what was going on then later I found out that he took LSD. There were a lot of surprises in this book that was one of the many reasons why I loved this book.<BR>I recommend this book to people that want to see what some teenagers have to deal with and that life isn't so \\"peachy\\" all the time. I would also recommend this book to people that have a lot of problems to deal with so that they can see that they are not all alone that there are people out there like them.
B00007KQA3|5.0|\\"April 4th, 1984 ... I think\\"<br />I picked Nineteen Eighty-Four as one of the books for a high school reading assignment in my junior year.  I didnt actually read it then (1975), but read it just after high school.  By the time Id finished it was near the top of my list of favorite books  and remains so.  When 1984 came out in 1984 I, naturally, rented the video and fell in love with the film.  It was one of the better-done film adaptations of a book that Id seen.  I was really taken with the martial music of Dominic Muldowney so I rushed out and bought  The Soundtrack  by the Eurythmics.  Well, no martial music, no nothing; just Eurythmics.  When the Muldowney soundtrack became available a few years ago I purchased it and tried to envision the film with Mr. Radfords original choice attached.  I even wrote the director to ask if it was going to be different than the 84 release (I never heard back from him).<br />So whats all this about soundtracks and the Eurythmics and Muldowney you ask?  When my copy of this DVD came in March 2003 I was more than pleasantly surprised with a number of things.  First, the picture quality is plusgood.  Secondly, and even though they are credited, there is not a hint of the Eurythmics on this DVD!  Thats doubleplus-phenomenal!  The film has a different feel to it, almost a nostalgic feel, that the original didnt have and that I credit to the soundtrack changes.  I know there are some that think the film should have been tampered with, but having followed the history of this film and the conflict Mr. Radford encountered with Virgin, Im very pleased that its been released in this format.  I would have liked to have seen the Eurythmics soundtrack added as an option, but it was not.<br />As someone said earlier; this is not the book.  It is a well-written, well-adapted, film that captures (for me) the essence of Orwells work.  I highly recommend it.
078878983X|5.0|A Review by Charlie<br />Marie Antonia is given a diary by her teacher so she may learn to be a better writer and speller. For years she writes in this diary. When she was 7 she's told that when she's older she is to marry the Dauphine of France (prince). At the age of 13 the official marriage proposal comes from the king. There is much preparation to be done before she is married.  When she meets her husband for the first time she is repulsed by him, but later grows to love him.<br />One of the things that I didn't like about Marie and all the royal characters in general was the way they thought of the \\"common\\" people. The rule that they have that common people can not talk to a royal or noble unless spoken to first is ridiculous. though I do know that was just the way it was in the past, I'm glad people don't act like that anymore. I did like how the author made the Dauphin though. How she made Louis \\"repulsive\\" looking but a little more lovable in the end. <br />I would not recommend this book for everyone. I think you would have to be interested in history and the lifestyles of the royals long ago, or how people then dealt with things. Though otherwise I would have to say it's a good book and I would recommend it to quite a few people.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This album is amazing me. It is similar to first album. Linkin Park's music is more pewerful any other rock music. I think. shock! shock! Just can say.. when I had heard \\"in the end\\", their first album title song, I can understand their music themes, you know. but I can not find out their sound style until listening Meteora album. Meteora has strong electric sounds and powerful vocal sounds. Energetic sounds and scratching sounds are mixed up this album. May you say like this: Their song had not changed after \\"Hybrid theory\\" but if you are listen carefully, you can go to another rock world.<BR> <BR> This album's title song is \\"Somewhere I Belong\\". It start poweful guitar sound, and slowly get to the climax with energetic voice. This song has slow beat and short internal beat. It makes much fantastic sounds. Just good and great. \\"Dont't stay\\" are shouting vocal and scatching sound which is made of more powerful beats. \\"Lying from you\\" is strange song because it has not clearly sound, but mid part of this song reveal so fast rapping and shouting vocal sound which are lead to me more upset emotional atmosphere. \\"Hit the floor\\" has stop and slow sound. Lower vocal sound make me comfortable emotion. It can be harmony vocal and sound. you know. \\"Easier to Run\\" has powerful electric guitar sound. This song is more emotinal than any other song in this album. Just listen without lyrics, and you can feel charmed their another voice. \\"Faint\\" has so fast beats and raps. It is more enjoyable my mind. but you can see power is in weak sound. Please enjoy this fast beat song. There are energetic guitar sounds in \\"figure. 09\\". It is very suitable on sound and hard vocal. Shout vocal makes your heart utmost beating. It is simple way to get rid of your stressed mind, I think. \\"Breaking the Habit\\"'s sound is so simple beat, I know. So in my case I just felt that is so boring sound.. Certainly not... What do you feeling about this song? \\"From the inside\\" has very beautiful vocal, so youcan feel their mixed up sound that is fantastic guitar sound and shouting vocal sound. One~~two and three beat is much easy to understand their music idea. \\"Nobody's Listening\\" has atmosphere arabian world, you know. Watch out! Cobra can be winded your body! U~~~ It's horrible thinking, huh? Please be careful. Don't be shy about the cobra is loving you. Just feel rhytmn and non fiction. \\"Session\\" has powful drum sound. The more fast sound, the more deep sound in this song. No voice. Only scratching and beating sound. There is fashionable sound in \\"Nump\\". It is more emotional sound making our mind so happy.<BR> <BR> Linkin Park had tried to more change their album color in \\"Meteora.\\" It is smilar to their first album color, also. But we can find out after listening their music which is charmed with shouting, scratching, beating, and so fast rapping. It is combined with energetic guitar sound and shouting vocal sound. That is harmony. It makes very fantastic music. Freely listen Linkin Park's album , if you have a chance, and it is your favorite album.... Have a try and Good luck!
0440237688|4.0|A Review by Jason<br />The Giver is about a young boy named Jonas who lives in a \\"community\\" with his mother, father and little sister Lilly. Jonas is eleven and turns twelve during the course of the book. Every year the community has a ceremony of 12 where the children who will be turning 12 for that year will get the assignment for the job they will do for the rest of their lives in the community. Jonas is assigned as the giver, and finds out that his assignment is the most important in the community.<br />This book is an easy read for most people who in 6th grade or above but it is a book that I enjoyed from front to back. This book seems to be very well written and flows very naturally with very few unnecessary words or information, everything seems to tie into something that previously happened so you are always gathering new information about something you may not have gotten earlier in the book.  The only thing I did not lie about this book was the ending, I think Jonas could have handled the situation that was eventually the end of the book better than what he did. I like how Lois Lowry describes how important the ceremony of twelve is and how Jonas and the rest of his peers have many apprehensions just before the ceremony, \\"the entire community attended the ceremony each year. For the parents, it meant two days holiday from work; they sat together in the huge hall. Children sat with their groups until the went, one by one, to the stage.\\"<br />I would recommend this book for any person that likes a science fiction book about what the future might be like for us. This book is about a 6th grade reading level but it can be read by 4th and 5th graders without much trouble. This is a great book and an interesting one about what our future might be like.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Meteora does continue along the same lines of Hybrid Theory, but if you like Linkin Park, then you should have no reason to dislike this album. <BR>As for those who complain about the turntables, I think they need to go listen to something else, because the turntables are an intrinsic part of the band, something that you can't do away with. I don't know how they can say that they liked the first one, but not the second one, because of the turntables.
B0000046KM|5.0|I have had this CD for nearly 3 years now, and in all that time, I have yet to find another album anything like this. Rarely have I gone more than a few days without pulling this out and playing it again. <br />Shirley's hypnotically slow phrasing pulls every ounce of meaning from each word. Johnny Mandel's orchestral accomaniment is generally understated, with the occassional gentle swell to send the chills down your spine. And Wynton Marsalis' trumpet solos on &quot;Quietly There&quot; and &quot;A Time for Love&quot; add the perfect touch.<br />The perfect album for a rainy afternoon, a warm summer evening, or pondering the mysteries of life in the wee small hours of the morning. Buy it. I promise you won't regret it.

Sledge's personal accounts and graphic descriptions of battle and the emotional and psychological impact of battle are riveting.  This is a must read for any WWII or miltary history buff who is looking to get into the mind of those who where there and gave their all!  Semper Fi!
B00003CXXS|5.0|I dont know why people didnt like this movie.. because I did. It had Romance, Action, Drama... tons of good stuff!! and NEW Dinos like the birds (unlike the other movies we the charaters NEVER got fac-to-fac with) We saw alot more of the Raptors, and even learned some things about them.<br />This movie is just as good as the first. BUT basically all the first movies of Sequels are the best.<br />That is all!!! I love Jurassic Park
B00005QW5X|4.0|Hedwig and the Angry Inch (John Cameron Mitchell, 2001)<br />It's been over a week since I finally saw Hedwig and the Angry Inch, and I still cant get my head around it. It was either the most wonderful musical ever made, Rocky Horror with far more talent and watchability, Spinal Tap with drag queens and goths, or some twisted combination of all three that had one unfortunate casting decision. In any case, the movie had a whole lot going for it.<br />Director Mitchell also stars as Hedwig, a transvestite whose sex change operation was botched, and thus lives in a constant state of bitterness and despair. Hedwig and her band, the Angry Inch, tour the U.S. playing horrible little holes while Hedwig's ex-boyfriend Tommy (Michael Pitt, recently seen in Murder by Numbers) has gone on to superstardom and is selling out arenas. But the plot is just a backdrop for the Ziggy Stardust-esque songs of the Angry Inch, some of which are accompanied by gorgeous videos of various types (Mitchell's animated sequences, while naïve in construction, have an unmistakable power to them).<br />The one place the movie goes horribly, painfully wrong is in the casting of Andrea Martin, a woman whose very presence is liable to set the viewers teeth on edge. Shes what would happen if, by some horrible accident of nature, Gilbert Gottfried and Carrot Top were suddenly able to have a child together.<br />Other than that, though, a minor gem that was, not surprisingly, overlooked by Hollywood. *** ½

6304169558|4.0|If ever a film was made to perpetuate the stereotype of Oklahoma as a state mercilessly and relentlessly ravaged by tornadoes, TWISTER is it.  As a resident of Oklahoma, I can assure the readers of this review of two things:  1) tornadoes do on occasion occur here; and 2) tornadoes do not come in endless waves, one after another, like some sort of demented assembly line.<br />Having said this, TWISTER is a remarkably entertaining film.  It's a fasten-your-seatbelt, get-ready-to-duck, leave-both-hands-inside-the-car rollercoaster ride, complete with eye-popping, hair-raising special effects.  This movie is a vivid feast for the eyes:  menacing, swirling tornadoes of various shapes and sizes; flying cows; and an endless assortment of storm debris to block the path of our protagonists, from tractors to tanker trucks--even houses.<br />The plot plays second fiddle to the action and special effects.  Thank goodness:  if the plot had to carry this film, the movie would have collapsed into a sappy and contrived love story.  From the very beginning of the film, when meteorologist Bill Harding (Bill Paxton) locates his estranged stormchasing wife Dr. JoAnne Thornton-Harding (Helen Hunt) out on the northern Oklahoma plains and asks her to sign divorce papers, the viewer instantly realizes:  the couple, eventually, will get back together.  Thankfully, Mother Nature takes over and the film takes off. Paxton and Hunt are solid in their performances, yet Philip Seymour Hoffman steals the show, as techno-goofy, slightly off-center Dusty Davis, a member of JoAnne's stormchasing team.  If anyone can have a good time in the face of oncoming disaster, it's Dusty (who refers to a tornado's swath of destruction as \\"the suck zone\\").<br />Director Jan de Bont delivers nonstop action like a swirling wall cloud; TWISTER is nervous energy unleashed, a cacophony of sights and sounds that keeps the adrenaline flowing.
B00000ILDF|4.0|Alien 3 is commonly seen as the worst of the trilogy, by some people even worse than Alien Resurrection (most unnecessery addition to the series, if you will!). Personally I think most people just wanted to see another Aliens movie instead of this - more guns, more marines, more aliens. But what would be the point of doing something that has already been done quite well? Instead of complaining, I'll concentrate on what it has to offer.<BR>This movie may not be as scary as Alien, not as action-packed as Aliens (some parts here do drag), but when it comes to atmosphere and emotion, it's another story. <BR>The story, soundtrack and images all mix perfectly to create a two hour long trip of hopelessness and despair with the best end scene of all Alien movies. I believe this \\"nihilistic\\" character of the movie is another reason why so many people dislike it.<BR>I like Fincher's direction here. Whether you like the movie generally or not, I would be surprised if people would disagree with me that some of the scenes during the first 30 minutes of the movie are awesome. As in Seven and Fight Club, everything here has this sort of worn-out, rusty look, another thing I like.<br />Being the music fan I am, I must add that I haven't seen another movie where music is used in such an amazing way. If you like this movie, you'll love the soundtrack. Listening to the last song (and theme for the ending), Adagio, it sounds exactly like an end to a long, hard story. The opening track (Agnus Dei) on the other hand sounds exactly like waking up from a happy dream (see: ending of Aliens) to reality of nightmare.<br />All in all, this is a movie that needs to judged for what it is instead of what it's predecessors were.
0345347951|5.0|This book was recommended to me by one of my Art professors as a possible source for a theme in my current work.  As I read I became more and more convinced that even pre-moonlanding sci-fi can serve a purpose in the new millennium.  I am now very interested in reading more of Arthur C. Clarke's work, despite my bad experience with A Space Odyssey.  I would recommend this book to those interested not only in sci-fi, but also more universal and fundamental questions about where we are headed and why we as humans have certain aspirations and ambitions.
0451207521|4.0|I recently read and enjoyed another book based during WWII with the main character being a woman in the resistance, also in France, so I got Jackdaws as well. <br />Flick Claret is one of the best women characters I've ever encountered.  She's strong and sensative and holds her own in situations that many men would bulk at.  <br />Like Flick, Nazi General Dieter Frank also had many sides.  Reveared as a torture specialist, the reader also gets to know him as a husband, father and (adulterous) lover.  <br />The individual women who are recruited for the Jackdaws mission are a varied group with interesting backgrounds but I thought they just added color for the main characters.  I'd have liked to know more about them.<br />For me, this was a little slow getting started but it became a real page turner.  There were several times that the crisis at hand didn't pan out the way I thought it would, which really made me want to keep reading.  A few characters were pretty well developed but others who seemed to have alot of depth were left alone.  Although these people were in high-risk positions during a crucial time in the war in France, they still had to deal with the up's and down's of everyday life and love.  Flick didn't have time to dwell on her failing marriage or to second guess her feelings for another man.  In some ways the complexity of the war and the assignment of the Jackdaws brought clarity to what otherwise may have been annogonzing personal decisions.<br />I'd like to know what happend to those who survived the mission.  I think there's potential for a post-war Jackdaws reunion.
B00008H2LB|2.0|I loved &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; and was really looking forward to Linkin Park's new release, but this one's a big let down! Now, even Evanessence does &quot;Linkin Park&quot; better than Linkin Park. How sad...<br />Unfortunately the CD is just a big yawn. I guess I'll have to wait for the next Audioslave CD to be this disappointed again. Save your money on this stinker!
B00005ATQD|5.0|Since Eyes Wide Shut was a high-profile movie released in the summer of 1999 and starring two major stars, it was inevitable that the film was going to incite the interest of casual moviegoers. Casual moviegoers attracted by the presence of Cruise and Kidman and unaware of what the term \\"Kubrick film\\" means and most likely also unaware of who Stanley Kubrick is. These casual moviegoers were probably successfully alienated by the film after the first hour at least. Many people would label Eyes Wide Shut a disappointment, perhaps expecting a Tom Cruise star vehicle. What they got was a long, slow-moving, complex, atmospheric, psychological, dream-like story. Certainly not typical summer movie fare. Eyes Wide Shut was probably the most bizarre film released in the summer of 1999, certainly out of place among such movies as Wild Wild West, The Mummy and The Phantom Menace. <br />Eyes Wide Shut is a big budget art-house movie. This is a film that most people will probably not enjoy. Warner Brothers no doubt realized this and probably knew that the film would lose money, but Kubrick being such a major director they let him do what he wanted. Because of the star power of Cruise and Kidman, the high-profile summer release and pre-release hype, Eyes Wide Shut was bound to be a grossly misunderstood film, and indeed it was. The film really only manages to find its audience among Kubrick fans. Fortunately, though, there are many, many Kubrick fans. So, if you know what you're getting into, if you like slow-moving thematically complex films and if you understand how Kubrick worked, then Eyes Wide Shut is a film that you will probably enjoy.<br />Inspired by a 1926 German novella, Eyes Wide Shut is a sexual odyssey, a surreal psychological journey. It's a film where not everything is clear and obvious, so there is room for debate over some of the more ambiguous areas. Even if you neglect to derive any meaning from it, the film still stuns as an atmospheric, moody piece. The film's mystique is its greatest asset. There is an eerie air of mystery and uncertainty that abounds. The masked party scene, the \\"focal-point\\" of the film if you will, is an unforgettable scene that is both awe-inspiring and spooky. Masterfully shot by Kubrick, this sequence ranks right up there with the greatest moments of his greatest films of the past. It's pure Kubrick. Eerie and foreboding, yet beautiful and graceful at the same time. It's a surreal, dream-like sequence which makes us question if it's really happening, or if Tom Cruise's character is merely dreaming. No other scene in the film is an intensely fascinating as the masked-party scene, but the story still maintains interest. The film becomes highly suspenseful at that point as it seems that the masked party patrons really are dangerous. [...] <br />Eyes Wide Shut is beautifully filmed from beginning to end. Kubrick's usual steadicam tracking shots are frequent, the lighting is vivid with scenes bathed in orange and blue, and the production design is outstanding. New York City streets were recreated on soundstages in England, but you'd never know. Certainly worth noting is the music, whether it's the beautiful opening waltz or the suspenseful one-note cue heard later in the film. Kubrick has always used music to masterful effect, and Eyes Wide Shut is no exception.<br />The film is 100 percent Kubrick and fans should certainly not be disappointed. It's a masterful triumph of atmosphere and mood, a brilliant, complex journey that few filmmakers could have pulled off. Eyes Wide Shut was Kubrick's last film, but it is definitely worthy of his legacy. It is, in my opinion, his finest film since A Clockwork Orange. A masterpiece.

B00005A1PR|2.0|Ok, I really hate that when some girl comes in, people think that it's just some miraculous talent just cause she writes her songs, and doesn't sing about sex and the usual r n'b stuff. Get over it. India Arie. is not the incredible talent that people make her out to be.It just really shows how much soul/r n'b music has gone down if we get so impressed when somethin' like this gal comes in.The music is incredibly repetitive.I'm sorry, but with the exeption of maybe 2 songs, everything runs together, making me want to fall asleep.And this is coming from a person who adores slow songs!Her lyrics are VERY  elementary, and just seem contrived. Really, she's so on with the whole \\"love urself\\" thing that it just gets depressing.Why can't she just share honest music??I'm sure not every aspect of her life has been so \\"uplifting\\".But the thing that annoys me the most about India Arie is how she uses her race to sell her music. I swear,in practically every single song, she just has to let ya know that she's Black.Don't take this wrong way, but it almost makes me feel uncomfterable.Imagine, say a White artist mentioning the fact that he/she is white in half their songs??????She's obviously using this to sell, which is kind of sad.What happened to the days when artists shared their soul,not the color of their skin.I wouldn't care if India was pink,purple,or yellow for that matter.It's your skin color, and that is nothing to be proud of.We all have skin,and you know, having a certain skin color is not achieving something great in life!I give it two stars, because I think she has a nice voice, and I like it how she keeps it simple and doesn't try to oversing.But other than that, India is unbelievably overrated,and does not deserve a quarter of the praise she's recieved.Just because she's not Britney spears doesn't make her  some out-of this world artist.
0312305060|3.0|THE HOURS was a little hard to follow and at times I had to reread some of the passages to see if I had missed some key point.  There are three central characters and each chapter is about one of the three women.  Virginia Woolf was by far the most intriguing of the characters and of course she was a real person. I didn't find the other two women to be sympathetic as people. Clarissa Vaughn seemed to be living in the past and Laura Brown was a woman who didn't want to face real life and lived in a world of the books that she read. I was constantly trying to find the link between the main characters, and of course some things are finally revealed at the end of the story.<br />Since THE HOURS was based on Virginia Woolf's book, MRS. DALLOWAY I really wish that I had read that story first. Michael Cunningham has written a very unique and original book, but I have to admit that I didn't like the story and thought it was rather depressing. I don't think that I'll see the movie.
B0000844IT|4.0|Army of Darkness, or as it is better known \\"Evil Dead 3,\\" is a wonderful movie. It's a rare instance where a film in a series will take an entirely different approach from its previous instalments. The first two Evil Deads were cult favourites of 80's horror buffs. Army of Darkness on the other hand has a cult following, but this cult also includes comedic buffs. Yes, comedic buffs. As opposed to sticking with the successful blood, gore & frights common in the first two, the film-makers decided to go with slap-stick, one-liners, mild fright and an over-all good adventure in this film. The movie tells the tale of Ash, who after fighting off the evil of the Necromonicon, gets transported back into medieval times. In order to return home Ash must obtain the Necromonicon, as the book contains the passage required to send him to his own time. But in obtaining the book Ash releases The Army of the Dead/The Deadites who are led by Evil Ash. Ash uses his wit and charm to the best of his abilities and puts up one heck of a fight. Does he survive and make it back to his one time? Well, that depends on which version of the film you watch. This DVD is a masterful collection. Two versions of film are included here....the U.S. Theatrical Version on the first disk, with the second disk holding the Director's Cut Version. The extras are also quite wonderful. The U.S. Version is viewable in both widescreen and full-screen versions, with the Director's Cut in widescreen. As well as talent bios, the theatrical trailer, a great behind the scenes featurette, additional footage, deleted scenes, and story boards, a very wonderful and insightful commentary is also available with the Director's Cut. Even though Army of Darkness is available in a couple of different versions, THIS is the version to own. It was well worth the wait and I highly recommend that it be checked out. Horror fans might get a kick out of it and even comedy fans might enjoy it too. Who'd a thought a Three Stooges routine would work so well with a skeleton? Ash is a super-hero of sorts for the common man and in the great words of him \\"Shop smart, shop S-Mart.\\"
B000002B7U|3.0|This album shouldn't be dismissed because Ozzy and the band embraced the horrific look of glam rock. Ozzy's nickname during this era was &quot;Miss Piggy&quot;. Overweight, bad costume, tons of makeup and hairspray...good God. <BR>The songs are a bit on the light side but they still rock. This is Jake's masterpiece. His playing is unreal. Having said that there were fans back in the 80's who said Jake is better than Randy. Some reviews here say the same thing. This is beyond stupidity. Jake is awesome but he's no Randy. Randy has taken his place in rock history alongside such greats as Hendrix, Jimmy Page, Eddie Van Halen, etc. Jake is not in that category. What has he done since Ozzy? Badlands? Sorry, as much as I admire his fretwork he's already been forgotten. The 80's are over people. The guitar solo is long dead. Time to embrace Nirvana and Korn.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Having received the first three White Stripes albums as an early Christmas present about four short months ago, I could not wait to get my hands on this one. Their self-titled 1999 debut was endearingly lo-fi, ramshackle blues-rock; 2000's De Stijl was a mini-masterpiece, presenting a slightly more polished blues-rock sound along with more pop hooks and modern-rock touches; and 2001's uneven White Blood Cells sounded more classic-rock than bluesy. That artistic step backwards nevertheless became their breakthrough album; now, if there's any justice in the (music) world, the excellent follow-up Elephant should put this Detroit duo over the top. (Like, how 'bout a Grammy nomination this time?)<br />\\"Seven Nation Army\\" continues the Stripes' tradition of easing the listener into their discs with an insanely catchy, roof-rattling rocker (\\"Jimmy the Exploder,\\" \\"You're Pretty Good Looking For a Girl,\\" \\"Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground\\"); and, good lord, is that a bass I hear? \\"Black Math\\" is gleefully sloppy blues-rock in the style of the self-titled disc (and how's this for a refrain: \\"Maybe I'll put my love on ice / And teach myself, maybe that'll be nice\\"?). \\"There's No Room for You Here\\" sounds like \\"Dead Leaves...\\" under the influence of Queen (instead of Zeppelin); and I don't know what it is about songwriter-guitarist-pianist-lead singer Jack White, but he can basically tell a girl to get out of his face and still sound quite charming. Tackling the Burt Bacharach-Hal David chestnut \\"I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself,\\" Jack's emotional singing and playing radiate hurt and anger. In \\"I Want to Be the Boy to Warm Your Mother's Heart,\\" a tender piano ballad about a hapless guy trying to impress his girlfriend's mother, Jack conveys vulnerability as he seethes with mounting frustration (very similar in feel to \\"I'm Finding it Harder to Be a Gentleman\\"). \\"You've Got Her in Your Pocket\\" is a folkish, acoustic ballad in the mold of \\"We're Gonna Be Friends,\\" albeit more sinister -- a love song that straddles the thin line between devotion and possessiveness. \\"The Hardest Button to Button\\" is a straight-ahead rocker with oddball family-drama lyrics and some hints of bass. \\"Hypnotize\\" -- like the single \\"Fell in Love With a Girl\\" -- is a too-short blast of punk energy and quirky love lyrics (\\"I want to hold your little hand, if I can be so bold!\\"). On \\"The Air Near My Fingers,\\" a groovy blues-rocker that would've sounded at home on De Stijl, Jack sings about being a \\"mama's boy.\\" \\"Girl, You Have No Faith in Medicine\\" is giddy garage-rock, with an awesome chorus that incorporates the word \\"Acetaminophen\\"!<br />When I first listened to this disc, it sounded to me like a greatest-hits collection consisting entirely of previously unreleased songs; but you can't blame the Stripes for sticking with a winning formula (like the whole red-and-white thing -- I don't care what anybody says, I think it's classy). However, Jack and Meg White -- by all accounts, a divorced couple who have marketed themselves as ersatz siblings, a la The Ramones -- aren't above throwing the listener a few curveballs. \\"Ball and Biscuit\\" starts out as a standard blues-rocker, but turns into a powerhouse seven-minute jam thanks to Jack's squealing guitar solos. \\"Little Acorns\\" reminds me of They Might Be Giants, of all people (speaking of adorable, eccentric alternative-rock duos...); with Mort Crim's spoken intro leading into a bluesy, funky jam, and whimsical lyrics (\\"Be like the squirrel, girl ... Give it a whirl, girl\\") offsetting the propulsive rhythms, it sounds like a hybrid of \\"John Lee Supertaster\\" and \\"Snail Shell.\\" Meg, the duo's versatile drummer, finally gets to sing lead on the seductive \\"In the Cold Cold Night;\\" though she lacks her \\"brother's\\" distinctiveness, her voice is still a sweet surprise. The cute, super-catchy, countryish closer \\"Well, it's True That We Love One Another\\" consists of a three-way conversation between Jack, British chanteuseHolly Golightly (playing the object of Jack's affection with a friendly twang), and Meg (who's a deadpan delight, dispensing romantic advice).<br />Elephant ranks with De Stijl as the Stripes' best album thus far; I suppose that with fewer tracks (14 and 13, respectively), there's less room for filler. As with the first three White Stripes discs, the lyrics are sometimes goofy, often heartfelt, and always evasive -- Jack shows growth as a storyteller and yet maintains an air of mystery about him -- without ever resorting to profanity (how refreshing in today's Parental Advisory-stickered modern-rock realm!). Ultimately, this album feels like a culmination of everything Jack and Meg have worked for on previous records; they're still paying proper respect to their early blues influences, but also pushing themselves forward. I, for one, can't wait to see where they go next.
0812548094|4.0|Like night and day.... I was horrified by _Wizard's First Rule_ with the vulgar and disturbing sequences and the undistinguishable dialogue (remember the gratuatious use of 'friend'). But having promised someone to read both WFR and _Stone of Tears_ I was forced to continue the saga. How glad I am that I did. I must change my previous statement about not being a fan of the sword of truth series, because this book has changed my mind.<br />_Stone of Tears_ was well planned and equally well executed. It was excellent from start to finish. Here we find ourselves with Richard and Kahlan, once again they are put into action and danger by something greater than they are. But this time they must go their separate ways if they ever want to see eachother again. <br />Richard may very well die from the magic within, if he doesn't follow the Sisters of the Light to their palace and learn to control his gift. However, to accomplish this task, he must go alone without Kahlan. Richard will have to learn to use his gift while staying clear of the Sisters of the Dark, who want to destroy him and in doing so, set the Keeper of the Underworld loose on the living. <br />While Richard walks his path of destiny, Kahlan must follow her own. Kahlan will have to continue to learn and expand her own limits of endurance, in order to save her beloved Midlands from destruction by the Imperial Order. A group of fanatics who claim all societies must join with them or else be slaughtered, all for the sake of ridding the world of all things magical. Which includes Kahlan as a Confessor.<br />I was impressed with the use of prophecy in the book. So many things were set up within the first three chapters that by the time these events were carried out near the end of the book, I found myself constantly flipping back to the start just to clarify the prophecies. My only complaint was the akwardness of the events involving Zedd and Adie. The events at Adie's cottage were well written, however once thoseevents were played out, Goodkind seems to just shove the two back into the story near the end. This would be fine except that their story of survival is so hacked that as a reader I found it difficult to piece back together the events that they had gone through. Their story just seemed so forced and contrived, where with Kahlan and Richard we are taken on the road with them through their adventures.<br />Overall a very good story. And a fantastic three pages that have set up the premise of the next book _Blood of the Fold_. We have already met some of these people in SoT, and I am looking forward to finding out what they have in store for the next book in the series.

I have read this book every year for the past 25 years, and it never becomes stale or boring.  If you haven't read this book yet, stop depriving yourself.  Buy, read and enjoy.
B000089RVX|5.0|The factor that makes Evanescence stand out definitely has to be its lead singer.  There is something about her voice that makes you want to listen.  But just because her voice is so beautiful, and haunting at the same time, it would not carry with just any music.  The band behind her, with it's dark undertones, makes her voice stand out even more.  They are complimentary to one another.  And then there are the lyrics of the album.  This album is a triple threat, the music is evoking, the lead singer's voice is amazing, and the lyrics are powerful.  For example, the song My Immortal \\"and if you have to leave/i wish that you would just leave/because your presence still lingers here/and it won't leave me alone\\"; not only are the music and vocals to this song amazing, but the lyrics are as well.  This is definitely something that needs to be in everyone's collection.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Wow,this album seems to either nail you or leave you cold,glad to say it nailed me.It's haunting and melancholy.Kinda like having a soundtrack to your thoughts when you're in those places that have you feeling emotional.I can see it wouldn't be everyones favourite listen but if you like an original sound that's laced with an emotional thread albeit downbeat then you'll love this..I likened it to the marathon runner and the emotion you feel through the hurt of the last few miles.Of course to different people it will stir different images and emotions.It really is a beautiful listen..I didn't understand the vocals( being Icelandic ) but it doesn't matter,you feel like you know what's the lead singers saying,the musics that powerful.The sound has a vastness to it that creates sweeping images and feelings.It's great music to just close your eyes and let the music take you away.
B00008MNYS|5.0|I'm so happy to see a truly unique artist like Robbie Williams is making his presence known (again) in the states.  His first American effort &quot;The Ego Has Landed&quot; garnered critical acclaim, but audiences seemed a little confused by him.  Much of his sound reflected that of fellow pop idols Backstreet Boys and NSync, but his lyrics and overall attitude were strikingly different.  Now, in a time where music with substance reigns supreme, Robbie is back to finish what he started. <BR>The American version of &quot;Escapology&quot; differs from the UK release.  Three songs were removed and two new ones were put in their places.  The songs missing (Cursed, Hot Fudge, and Song 3) are very good, but they were not right for an American album.  Let me explain:  The new songs (One Fine Day and Get a Little High) are more mellow, acoustic-driven tracks.  While the UK album demonstrates a wide variety of sounds and instrument experimentation, the American release tries to be more consistent.  I believe the record company may be trying to associate Robbie more in the John Mayer and Rob Thomas category that has proven popular in the last year.  So he's more melodious, more subtle, less in-your-face.<BR>So, does this bluesy feel take away from the album?  Not really.  It's still a great effort; it's honest, uncompromising, and very catchy.  <BR>If you want to know more specific details about the music itself, please read my review of the Canadian import version.  If you love great music, pick up Robbie's album (at a bargain price pretty much everywhere).  If you are a Robbie fan, pick up both versions to get the full effect.  Either way, I hope &quot;Escapology&quot; finally gets Robbie the American success he deserves.
B00005RHGK|4.0|WHEN YOU TAKE A LONG MIDWEST ROAD TRIP YOU EXPECT RELAXTION ON THE DRIVE. NOT A OLD BEAT UP 40ISH TRUCK TRYING TO RUN YOU OFF THE ROAD. YOU EXPECT TO SEE PICKET FENCES CORN FIELDS, NOT A CLOAKED FIGURE THROWING WHAT LOOKS LIKE BODIES DOWN A SEWER PIPE. NOW AT THIS POINT IF YOU HAVE COMMON SENSE, YOU KNOW THAT SEEING SOMTHING LIKE THAT MAY GET YOU IN TO A LITTLE TROUBLE. WELL EXPECT ALOT OF TROUBLE IF YOU FIND YOUR SELF IN THAT SITUATION LIKE THE TWO TEENS IN JEEPERS CREEPERS. I THOUGHT THE MOVIE DID A GOOD JOB ON PREYING ON OUR FEARS OF THE BOOGEY MAN. I MEAN WHATS MORE SCARY THAN FINDING YOUR SELF IN A CHARNEL HOUSE WITH BODIES STACKED THE CEILING AND DISCOVERING TWO PEOPLE FROM A CHILD HOOD URBAN LEGEND ARE ACTUALLY REAL AND ARE AMONG THE DEAD. THROW IN WHAT SEEMS TO BE A DEMON WHO PREYS ON FEAR AND FLESH TO STAY IN OUR WORLD AND YOU HAVE A GOOD MOVIE. IF YOU LIKE HORROR MOVIES THIS IS A GOOD RENTAL OR A GOOD BUY ON AMAZON. OVERALL I LIKED IT, BUT THEY COULD HAVE DONE BETTER WITH ENDING.
B00000INEX|5.0|My children love it! I have 2 children and both love it although the older one doesn't have the attention span as she used to (7 month old and 21 month old).  I reccommend playing it from when they are infants because as they get older it's familiar and soothing.  We use the videos as \\"winding down \\" tools at night before bedtime.  My 7 month old is captivted as soon as it comes on.
B00008H2LE|5.0|Words can't describe the sound that linkin park has. some people call it electroni-rock or alternative even NUMetal but i disagree. LP's sound is much more than that. i think when u have a certain sound that people can name the band without having to hear a single lyric u have a diverse sound that people really admire and thats what LP is all about. Its funny because i hear people describe that one of the best songs on the cd (Breaking the Habit) as &quot;wierd&quot; or &quot;strange&quot;. What they dont realize is that Meteora has a very different sound than Hybrid Theory. Sure you can still tell that its Linkin Park but the songs have major change of sound. Everything from the guitars to Mr. Hahn and his Dj skills. I think Linkin Park wanted this cd to sound different just because they probably wanted to avoid making a Hybrid Theory Part 2. Hybrid Theory was a great album, but it got played out. To me, i felt that it would never get old and to this day i still love it but i think that radio stations were playing In The End way to many times(mostly because i think they wanted a new Lp album to come out so they tried to fill the void with those songs until it came out). But All in All, Meteora proves that LP will not fall off, or at least anytime soon.
B0000844MP|4.0|This movie definitely has a mythical (hence, Legends) quality to it. One of the sons, Tristan is linked to a bear in a mysterious way. The story has its share of tragedy, with a bittersweet ending. The scenery and music are beautiful and the actors portray their parts perfectly. <br />The movie quite clearly deals with a few of the ways we can \\"fall\\" as humans and the anguish that results both for us and the ones who love us. The story shows we can fall by choosing to desire that which isn't good for us, and we can fall by believing that we are cursed by God and without hope. It shows how destructive those choices and beliefs can be. For this author, redemption is found in the bond of family. <br />If it weren't for Isabel Two, I might say that the author was very negative toward women. The mother and Susannah are shown to be weak and Susannah is described as the unwitting demise of that all important family bond. She is like \\"water that flows into the crack in a rock and when it freezes, breaks the rock\\". I was disappointed that she seemed to not see the treasure she had in front of her and to rise up and conquer her misplaced desire. Still, the story was beautifully told and reminds us to be smarter than some of the characters! <br />The movie paced along very well. There is quite a bit of action as well as interesting dialogue. This is not a movie that drags.  There is some sex and some violence, which might be uncomfortable.  However these scenes are no more shocking than a lot of movies out there.<br />The bond of family was beautiful in this story, but they failed to bring in outsiders and make them family while maintaining that bond. This movie is well worth seeing if only for the complex interactions between the characters. Family is precious and this movie made me treasure mine even more.
B00008AWOD|4.0|This is the best placebo album. I have been listening to all of placebo's stuff religiously for weeks now, and have to say this is the best. Placebo has always been a band that writes good songs, but this is the first time they have made a really great album. The album maintains a dark tone throughout. Some songs are of course weaker than others, however I dont think there is any &quot;filler&quot; to be found. This will probably be one of the better albums to come out this year.
B00008DDSC|4.0|Maggie Gyllenhaal is a wonderfully offbeat young actress with a string of minor roles in some terrific independent films. In \\"Secretary\\", she makes her starring role debut, and she's terrific. Gyllenhaal plays Lee Holloway, an unstable girl who has just been released from a mental institution. She gets a job as a secretary for Edward Grey, an overbearing lawyer (James Spader). Edward is far from a normal boss however. His punishment for typos and minor spelling errors begin with mild humiliation, but as Lee swiftly responds to his demands,the punishments slowly begin to escalate. <br />\\"Secretary\\" treats kinky sex with extreme tenderness. To his credit, director and co-writer Steven Shainberg depicts the strange sexual interplay between Lee and Edward, with restraint. He is more interested in their emotions than their actions, and weights the images accordingly. When Lee goes to work for Edward, he sees her only as another in a string of women who will indulge his fantasies of dominance. But Lee transforms their connection from a game to a relationship, and paradoxically frees them both from guilt and self-hatred.<br />Mr. Spader does a smart, considered job as Edward, a man who does not understand his own needs until Lee begins to bloom with his attention. Just as he helps her unlock her sensuality, she helps him unlock his kindness. <br />Based on a highly regarded short story by Mary Gaitskill, the movie shows wit as well as insight. Lee attempts a romantic relationship with a fellow psychiatric case (Jeremy Davies), including a bedroom interlude. When he sweetly asks, \\"Did I hurt you?\\" there is no disguising the disappointment in her voice when she answers \\"No.\\"<br />Whether it shocks or disturbs or amuses, \\"Secretary\\" deserves applause for doing something most movies avoid these days: addressing adult sexuality - a non-mainstream kind of sexuality -with wit, style and compassion. This film is highly recommended!!!
B00005ARDC|4.0|Yeah, it sounds like JAMC. So what? Yeah, it has a Brit-Pop feel to it. So what? Yeah, it's derivitve. So what? It's a damn good album, better than the Strokes, the White Stripes, etc who every other reviewer seems to be name-dropping (no 'cool' points for knowing those bands, people.)It's a good American band doing a good American album - stupid crap punk like Blink 182 and Sum 41 be damned. So, take your JAMC, the Stone Roses comparisons and whoever else you may think they sound like and say to yourself, so what? It's only rock-n-roll but I like it.....
0440224764|2.0|After the setup - a lawyer fakes his death, steals $90M, escapes to Brazil, only to be caught, tortured, and returned to the US for prosecution - I expected a dynamite book.  Then I settled into approximately 400 pages of yawn-yawn lack of action as our hero sits in a hospital, scheming with his lawyer on his legal strategy while recovering from his torture-related wounds.  The ending was pathetic.  I was expecting some sort of stunning conclusion, perhaps an unexpected confession from left field.  Instead, I got the impression Mr Grisham got tired and simply quit writing.  It was a very unsatisfying conclusion, which leaves the reader hanging.<br />Score this one as one star for plot.  I do bump it up to two stars overall, only because Mr Grisham's style of prose flows well, even if he doesn't really have anything to say.
B00008CLOA|5.0|What is it about this album? I don't know, I never will. If I did, I'd bottle it and become a billionaire.<br />Nothing more needs to be said, because no words will ever do it justice. It's just... perfect...
B00007G207|5.0|A story about falling in love and meeting people who change our lives forever. It tells the story of growing up and moving away from home, while never forgetting our past and where we are from. The main character (Salvatore) returns to his hometown after 30 years of being away and discovers that he was never really gone. His feelings are unchanged about the people he had affection for while growing up - mainly his first love Elena and Alfredo, the projectionist and his father figure. During his visit, he learns he must let go of some longings and desires that can never be fulfilled. The ending I will not soon forget. I was amazed and felt this is more than just a movie, it is hard to describe in words.
0807261785|4.0|Not written for the overly indulged and exceedingly sheltered suburban soccer brat, this manuscript appears to be written more for the youngster with a dubious attitude toward \\"happily ever after.\\"  I'm still trying to decide quite WHAT I think -- I acknowledge being appalled when insidious Count Olaf slapped Klaus, bound Sunny and attempted to marry 14 year old Violet.  But it might give credibility to the child who understands powerlessness?  Probably the intended audience has some experience along those lines?  I thoroughly enjoyed the interweaving of vocabulary and definitions, Violet's \\"inventing\\" tendencies, Klaus's fascination with books, and the rather smarmy narrator conveys MUCH with his voices.  This should appeal to an adolescent who might not buy the goody-two-shoes books directed at that generation.  My friend who recommended this series says that the books become more clever language wise, and that the author \\"starts making his views known on things he finds absurd - for instance, people who follow trends, the \\"in\\" crowd, etc.\\"  So, I think I'll stick with Lemony for a bit.
B00004TL2N|4.0|If you're acquainted with Bruckner's Eighth, and very much like hearing it the way you're used to, this is not the album for you.  In trying to take a different approach to this much-recorded work, Pierre Boulez has given us what one reviewer calls a Strauss-like Bruckner.  He has leveled off a lot of the stark Bruckner contrasts, but in doing so, has lost much of Bruckner's power.<br />I remember decades ago, when the favorite analogy to describe Bruckner's symphonies was &quot;towering cathedrals in the clouds.&quot;  Boulez appears to have planted the cathedrals in the middle of a Johann Strauss orchestra.  Now, that's not all bad.  It gives us a fresh interpretation of this work and still retains memories of the original.<br />If you haven't enjoyed Bruckner, this might be just the thing to pique your interest.  It's not your father's Bruckner.
B00008DDSA|5.0|Young Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) gets her first job as a secretary in the law office of Mr. E. Edward Grey (James Spader). Shy, frumpy and unsure of herself, Lee initially has trouble coping with Mr. Grey's perfectionism. The boss and  secretary's dependency on one another grows and evolves into an overt dominant-submissive relationship. Through this relationship, Lee gains self-confidence and is able to put the self-destructive habits of her past behind her. Both Lee and Mr. Grey find the love and understanding that they crave in this unconventional but mutually fulfilling relationship.<br /><br />Secretary is equal parts love story, psychological drama, and sex farce. In some ways, it is a classic romance: Two needy people discover that what they need is each other. But in Secretary, the characters' emotional needs are extreme, and their ways of expressing love are eccentric. The film treats the subject of dominant-submissive relationships with humor and generally good nature. It doesn't equate these relationships with dysfunction, but instead asserts that dominant-submissive behavior can be a way for some people to  overcome dysfunction, or at least to transform it into something harmless. The performances are terrific. James Spader is wonderful as Mr. Grey, a middle-aged divorced lawyer who is distrustful of love and sometimes afraid of what his own desires might mean. Maggie Gyllenhaal is radiant, funny, and totally convincing as the bright but troubled young secretary.<br /><br />Secretary isn't graphic, but it is kinky, and it does not moralize. If you don't like the idea of &#34;alternative&#34; lifestyles, you won't like this film. If you don't mind breaking with convention, I highly recommend Secretary. It is funny, touching, provocative, and boasts some great performances.

B00008H2LB|4.0|the title says it all...<BR>the lyrics are more mature and i think that they are better than the lyrics from the first album..but even though the lyrics are nicer and the album is a little harder than the pervious one,its still LP...i mean the songs could fit perfectly in Hybrid Theory...so the band havent developed a new sound....<BR>the album has more skirts and rap mixing..so you will hear a lot of rap in it...<BR>even though its a cool production,i think that Hybrid Theory was a lot better than Meteora...but maybe that its not a surprize...as a lot of bands who have a lot of success in a short time...the band its very busy...so they dont have so much time to develop a masterpiece like Hybrid Theory..<BR>anyway..the whole album doesnt show excellent sparks...the tracks are average....
B00008GKEG|5.0|First there was the ABC special, then the 3 double-CDs plus two CD singles of the new Beatles songs (&quot;Free As a Bird&quot; &amp; &quot;Real Love&quot;), then the 8-volume VHS, then the massive Anthology hardcover book, now a massive papaerback, then all of the promotional material (pins, shirts, even small CD cases)....now it is the four DVD pack PLUS that special bonus DVD with the &quot;Real Love&quot; video and more unseen foortage from the '94, '95 sessions.  Aside from the unseen/unheard Beatles material that were recently uncovered by police, we have it all.  What other band can  put together a CD of all of their #1's (Beatles 1) and sell 8 million.  What other band can put out three double-CD sets and all go to number 1??  Only the Beatles...and I'm proud to love them.<br />The DVD collection is extraordinary!!  It is sharp, it is vivid and it's worth every penny.  I'm glad to know that George was around to see the explosion of the most recent Beatlemania and he would have loved to see these DVDs but I am sad the John never got to see any of this.  It is the Anthology series that Paul, George and Ringo have opened up in recent years to say they were proud to be Beatles and I believe if John were here, he would have felt the same.  Enjoy these DVDs...they are perfect all around!
B000060P79|5.0|this cd is s awesome, commin from a punk fan it is softer than most i heard, but rifts are hard and both guitars mix great.resemble new found glory but way better there new cd was disapointing to me. if u think it was good u'll love this album. IF you arn't sure just look at the cover guys..nice.
B00008H2LB|5.0|instead of getting angry right away the first time you listen to Meteora, take the time to let it grow on you. I felt the same as you when i bought this CD and realized how it didn't even compare to Hybrid Theory.       the thing about Hybrid Theory was that it had nothing to be compared to so people accepted it with a CLEAN slate. if only you'd do the same with Meteora. take a walkman and listen to this CD over and over and then eventually you'll love it like I do now.       Believe me, when i first listened to this thing, i wanted to take a hammer and smash it to pieces and then throw the remaining parts out the window to be completely forgotten. every single song has grown on me, and they are all unique in a different way. i've noticed new things now than i have a week ago.       my most favorite songs are &quot;Hit the Floor&quot;,&quot;Faint&quot;, &quot;Figure9&quot; and &quot;Numb&quot;. Numb is an amazing song.       This CD is definitely worth your money and time. Give it a chance and you may or may not be disappointed, it's completely up to you if you are even a smidget of a Linkin Park fan and respect them for their music.
B00005JLZ9|4.0|And so does Samuel L. Jackson. It's a fairly good movie, about Samuel L. Jackson's character missing in combat. Kinda like the General's Daughter in the sense that they get answers from witnesses and even killers. The major difference, Tom Hardy(John Travolta) is actually a suspect, compared to his character in the General's Daughter. I kinda liked the other movie better, but this is still good!! Two thumbs up!!!!
B00008H2LB|4.0|I agree with Matthew Cooke, Meteora is truer to the band's nature, but I see no resemblance between Rage Against the Machine and Linkin Park.  In fact, Rage Against the Machine has no resemblance to any of the other bands listed in Cooke's review of meteora.  It's very hard to take this review serious when he compares Fred Durst's band to Tom Morello's.  True, they did both rap over rock riffs, but the comparisons end there.  <BR>As far as the Album, quality work from the band, no new ground musically but will keep fans happy.  Even if your not a big LP fan this album is a good listen if you like mainstream rock.

It's not often that I come away from a book and want to learn more about the subject matter.<br />When I realized how much I was enjoying the book (after chapter 2, I think) I went and bought all his other books, I'm now reading angels & demons and I'm loving it!!<br />I have found a new author whose books I will buy blindly from now on!!The only draw back is that judging from the amount of research that went into his books it might be a while before we hear from Prof. Langdon again!!<br />If you like your books filled with facts, intelligence, suspense and an oppurtunity to learn about new subjects too  DaVinci Code is the way to go.<br />Dan Brown you have a new fan !!!!

B0000025F7|5.0|With all the headlines about plastic surgeries, melting faces, questionable parenting practices and voodoo contracts on entertainment moguls, it's easy to forget just how talented Michael Jackson was (is?)<br />I found this in my CD collection and popped it in. As a result, I remembered why I had a crush on Michael all thru my childhood and teenage years. Listening to tracks such as Off the Wall, Don't Stop Til You Get Enuf and Rock With You shows the true scope of a gifted performer who apparently got too caught up in his own publicity.<br />I've always considered Off the Wall a far superior work to Thriller and all subsequent Michael Jackson productions. The combination of Jackson, Quincy Jones and Rod Temperton provided the 80s with the best R&amp;B. To those who only became aware of Jackson during his Thriller fame, I suggest you buy this CD as well as some Motown Jackson 5 compiliations. It will answer questions of why he became famous in the first place.
0425152251|4.0|This book is great as an overview of some of the most influencial thinkers of all time. If you are just becoming interested in philosophy, are curious about what philosophy is about, or, as I am, deeply involved in studying philosophy, this book has something for everyone. I read this book a few years ago, while I was studying undergraduate philosophy and I found it great as a quick review to trick the brain into remembering who said what. Better yet, it's written in an intertaining way. I still pick it up once in a while, and recommend it to others, because it's a quick read, and it's fun.<BR>Enjoy it. Let it wet your whistle for more in depth philosophical works.
B000002KFJ|5.0|Many people think this is not one of Black Sabbath's best albums. In my opinion this is Sabbath's best album if not one of the best albums ever! It starts out with the heavy metal classic &quot;Hole in the Sky&quot;. &quot;Don't Start (Too Late)&quot; is a nice soft intro to the spine crushing heavy metal classic &quot;Symptom of the Universe&quot;. &quot;Megalomania&quot; is the next song and in my opinion the best heavy metal song ever. It is a 9 minute 43 second epic and it has great music and the lyrics are outstanding. &quot;Thrill of it All&quot; is another great track. &quot;Supertzar&quot; is a great instrumental with a choir which shows Black Sabbath's diversity. &quot;Am I Going Insane&quot; I'd hafta say is probably my least favorite track on the album but it is still a very very good Sabbath song. Even the worst song on an album is great. This classic album closes out with the anger filled &quot;The Writ&quot;.Another great heavy metal song. So if you are looking for a wonderful heavy metal album pick this one up because you won't be able to take it out of the cd player! Black Sabbath at their best!
B000002JSN|5.0|It took nearly two years after the release of \\"Houses of the Holy\\" for Led Zeppelin to release \\"Physical Graffiti\\" in 1975, but what a collection of songs. Perhaps not as instantly accessible as \\"IV\\" or \\"Houses\\" this set still packs a punch, and very few bands could pull of a fifteen song, two-album set with minimal filler. The set features some of the eclectic musical elements that Led Zeppelin favored, but with more of an overall rock feel and less acoustic numbers than previous efforts.<br />\\"Custard Pie\\" is a crunchy opener with a killer hook and powerful rhythm section. \\"The Rover\\" is another classic, with power chords galore, and a knockout vocal performance by Robert Plant.<br />\\"In My Time of Dying\\" is the first of several epic tunes on PG, with snaky guitars, an array of musical element changes and the haunting Plant vocal line \\"Oh my Jesus!\\"<br />\\"Houses of the Holy\\" must not have made it on to the previous album, but it's a rousing rocker here.<br />\\"Trampled Under Foot\\" is an all-time Zeppelin great, with a killer keyboard/guitar combo riff, and \\"talk about love\\" energetic vocal from Robert Plant.<br />\\"Kashmir\\" is the \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" of this set, mysterious and exotic and with imagery like one is flying on a magic carpet above snowcapped mountains in the foothills of the Himalayas. An orchestra backs the band and Jimmy gets to use his bow. Fantastic drum performance by John Bonham and outstanding vocals by Robert Plant. The \\"Big K\\" is still a staple of classic rock radio.<br />\\"In the Light\\" is John Paul Jone's showcase, with whale siren song keyboards rising and falling against an urban skyline.<br />\\"Bron-yr-Aur\\" is a reflective little acoustic piece that takes one on a journey to the English countryside.<br />\\"Down By the Seaside\\" has images of sunshine, sailboats and people having fun. Jimmy Page's guitar is drenched in a watery chorus effect. Watch out for the tempo change.<br />\\"Ten Years Gone\\" is another classic epic. \\"Night Flight\\" is an underrated cut, with a bouncy bassline and drum rhythm. I like Plant's emotional vocal performance here.<br />\\"The Wanton Song\\" is my least favorite song on the disk. The stutter starts and stops are cool, but I don't really care for Plant's vocals here.<br />\\"Boogie With Stu\\" on the other hand, has great boogie woogie piano by Jones, mandolins by Page, and one of Bonham's more interesting drum performances.<br />\\"Black Country Woman\\" is another underrated cut, recorded outdoors with a little airplane interruption, and layers of acoustic guitars and mandolins, and a folky feel that would have fit on \\"III.\\" I heard Plant do this in concert on a solo tour in 1988 and it was awesome.<br />\\"Sick Again\\" is a pretty weak closer.

B00005JLKN|4.0|Summary:<br />The movie begins with the capture of Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) by FBI agent Will Graham (Edward Norton).  However, the capture isn't a simple, \\"Put your hands up.\\"  Both Lecter and Graham are seriously wounded.  Lecter ends up in his famous cell and Graham retires from the FBI.  But when a new series of serial murders begins, Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel), Graham's boss, convinces Graham to come back to work for the agency to help them find the person they are calling 'The Tooth Fairy'.  Graham returns to the FBI but in working on the case he must request the help of Lecter.  Lecter, who has become quite famous for his murders, is also contacted by the serial killer who considers himself to be the incarnation of Blake's Red Dragon.  Graham has to work out the details and connections to figure out who the killer is while dealing with the psychological manipulations of Lecter.  The result is a climactic scene similar to the beginning of the movie when Lecter is captured.<br />My Comments:<br />I'll reveal my bias from the beginning - I love psychological thrillers and I'm fascinated by serial killers.  So, in reading my review you may want to keep that in mind.  The only problem I had with this movie is I wasn't sure Edward Norton was the perfect fit for an FBI agent.  I really like Norton in most of his roles and he plays all sorts of characters, there was just something about him as a serial killer profiler that didn't work perfectly.  I still think he did a good job, but I just wasn't sure I was as convinced that he was being played with psychologically - at least, not nearly as convinced as I was when Jodi Foster was being played with by Lecter in Silence of the Lambs.  So, that was a small problem.<br />Otherwise, the acting was great.  I particularly enjoyed Ralph Fiennes (Francis Dolarhyde & the Red Dragon).  He came across as extremely disturbed, which, obviously, was what he was supposed to be.<br />I read the book Hannibal before Iwatched the movie and was pretty disappointed by the movie.  I haven't read Red Dragon, so I don't know how they compare.  However, from my past experience reading Thomas Harris novels, I'm guessing that the book is probably better than the movie.<br />I also cheated when I was watching the DVD.  I have a tendency to look at the length of movies before I watch them - usually because I'm pretty busy and have to plan accordingly.  Well, as I was watching Red Dragon, I realized that Francis Dolarhyde had allegedly been killed at about 112 minutes but I knew the movie was 124 minutes long.  I wasn't positive what was going to happen next, I thought Lecter might escape, but once they showed Graham back at his home in Florida it clicked.  I liked the ending.  However, I'm not sure that it made perfect sense as serial killers go.  Of course, I'm not an expert on serial killer profiling and maybe it does, I just thought that it was actually plausible that Dolarhyde would kill himself instead of killing Reba McClane (Emily Watson).  To do what he did was pretty calculating and based upon how he seemed to be acting prior to that, I wasn't sure it worked perfectly, but I was ultimately satisfied.<br />Overall, I liked this movie better than Hannibal but not quite as much as Silence of the Lambs.  If you enjoyed Silence of the Lambs or like psychological thrillers, you'll probably enjoy this movie.  As with all movies about serial killers, it can be a bit disturbing (one of the people we were watching it with actually left the room she was so disturbed by it) what with references to eating people and what not.  But perhaps Lecter's fascination with cannibalism is what keeps fans of Thomas Harris's novels coming back.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I bought this album because people told me it sounded just like Joy Division, who are my all-time favorite band. Well, somebody has to say this and it's going to be me- Interpol don't really sound much like Joy Division, and all the reviewers who say otherwise are just demonstrating that they've never really listened all that closely to either band. Yes, Interpol are a dark post-punk band, but the similarity really ends there. Interpol songs are not built around the bass line like Joy Division songs, they aren't nearly as manic-sounding, and the tone of Interpol's music tends to be moody and reflective whereas the tone of Joy Division is coldly futuristic and impersonal. However, Turn on the Bright Lights is a brilliant album in its own right, with some of the best songwriting I've heard in a long time, and songs that grow on you more and more till you hardly want to hear anything else. Of course Interpol have their influences like any band does, and one of those influences might be Joy Division. But they don't really need to be compared to anyone. They shine on their own.
0553381709|5.0|It was late at night, I was just past the halfway point in the book and decided that I needed to get some sleep. I told myself that I would read a few more pages then put the book down. A few pages later Martin, who was consistantly shocking me, turned up the voltage and really put the taser to me.  I had just got to the \\"Red Wedding\\".<br />Throughout the series, characters that I thought I would be reading about until the end were dying faster than I could turn the pages.  I had, I thought, become used to it.  Then GRRM tells of the \\"Red Wedding\\".  WHAM!  BAM! There goes a few more (not-so) main characters. <br />Anyway, my night was shot. I could not get my mind off the book. I was now wide awake and would be for a few more hours.  I was cursing Martin for losing sleep and loving him for his \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\".  The following morning I was re-telling everyone how much I loved the book and series.<br />What a great series! I have been reading sci-fi fantasy for over 25 years this is the best I have ever read. Besides being Varys-well written (mis-spelling intended), the story is completely unpredictable. The characters are not your basic run-of-the-mill good guys and bad guys. All the characters are fallible, nasty, nice, caring, curt, apathetic, pathetic, heroic, self-serving and of course compelling. I imagine that if those of us that live today were to be teleported into GRRM's world and became part of the story, Martin would not have to change a thing. His characters are essentially real people acting and doing what real people do. Over the years I have grown used to the bad guys being evil and the good guys being saints, never the two will mix. I'm sure Martin laughs at that cliche. In his world people act like...well, people.  I believe that that is Martin's genius.  We have gotten so used to science-fiction being a black and white genre.  GRRM has just introduced us to the color gray (or in redards to the \\"Red Wedding\\" the color pink)<br />I HATE it. ILOVE it.   \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" is the drug I am addicted to. I want to stop, but I can't. It hurts so gooooood. <br />READ THIS SERIES.  YOU WILL LOVE IT.
0446691437|5.0|Witty, energetic &amp; thoroughly enthralling, Steven Pressfield's writing grabs you by the scruff of your neck &amp; sets you in front of your favorite mirror-not to look at how good you are-he wants you to see how unfulfilled you are by those old foes: fear &amp; resistance.<br />A good muscular read, with lots of stories, ideas &amp; lessons. Well worth the money!
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Since Moulin Rouge is my favorite movie, I just had to have this soundtrack. I got it recently and listened to it for almost two hours, and my little brother and sister were dancing to it! Only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because to get my 5 stars, I have to like pretty much every single song, and there were a few I DIDN'T like. So here's the low down on the songs:<br />Nature Boy (David Bowie)-Okay, I didn't really like this song that much. Not fast paced enough for me. So I skipped right over it after a few lines were sung.<br />Lady Marmalade (Christina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, Mya, Pink)-Before I even saw Moulin Rouge, I wanted this CD because of this song. It's a great song with soulful lyrics and the vocals are amazing. Lil' Kim, as untalented as she may be (sorry for being biased) provides rapping that actually makes the song better. But Christina's soulful voice got me when she sang that big long note, and I think it'll touch you too.<br />Because We Can (Fatboy Slim)-A song right from the movie. Perfect for dancing at parties and actually trying to do the can can (heel toe heel toe lift down kick!)<br />Sparkling Diamond (mostly bye Nicole Kidman)-What a great voice she has! I love this song. They skip over some parts of it that you hear from the movie, but besides that it's awesome.<br />Rhythm of the Night (Valeria)-I have no clue WHO she is, but it's a very cool song. Not as cool as some others, but pretty cool. Good rhythm of the night lol.<br />Your Song (mostly by Ewan McGregor)-Perfecta! Ewan's talent really shines through in this number. A perfect song to just sit and relax to.<br />Children of the Revolution (Bono, Gavin Frida, Maurice Seezer)-I skipped right over this song after a few lines. It wasn't really &quot;my cup of tea&quot;.<br />One Day I'll Fly Away (Nicole Kidman)-Although Nicole's talent really shines through in this song, I found myself bored by the first chorus and skipped to the next song.<br />Diamond Dogs (Beck)-I also skipped over this, as I was anxious to get to the next song.<br />Elephant Love Melody (Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor, Jamie Allen)-Could there BE a more perfect song? Best one on the CD, hands down. A pumped up mix of our favorite love songs sung perfectly by Nicole and Ewan (no clue WHERE this Jamie Allen person comes in).<br />Come What May (Nicole Kidman, Ewan McGregor)-I like the movie version of this song better, but it's still a really good song that is also perfect for relaxin to with your boyfriend/girlfriend (like I would know lol).<br />El Tango de Roxanne (Ewan McGregor, Jose Feliciano, Jacek Koman)-The second best song on the CD. I love doing dance routines to this song w/my lil sis, and she loves it too. Perfect opportunity to get some good dancing into your exercise routine!<br />Complainte de la Butte (Rufus Wainwright)-I didn't really like this song. A bit odd sounding to me...<br />Hindi Said Diamonds (Nicole Kidman, John Leguizamo, Alka Yagnik)-Okay song. It's from the end of the movie. Sorta short, but a pretty good song.<br />Nature Boy (David Bowie and Massive Attack)-I found this same as the first Nature Boy.<br />So that's my review. Hope it's helpful!
B000009EAD|5.0|What can I say this album rocks. Of course I'll tell you to buy every Iced Earth album. I've only been listening to these guys for a few months but I've been so impressed by their talent that I almost own every one of their cd's. One of my favorite songs on this album is 1776. It's a really good instrumental song. I could go on and say how every other song on the cd rocked, but it could take a few more paragraphs. So just buy the album you won't be disapointed.
0060512806|4.0|I don't usually place much weight into the book reviews publishers tag on back covers, but the review on this book really does describe it  - this book is Tom Clancy mated with William Gibson with James Mitchner acting as a midwife. <br />Even though this book is an astounding 1200+ pages, it is an engrossing read. Like Mitchner, the story weaves the lives of many generations together through a common theme. Except Mitchner never wrote about lives so exciting (Apologies to any Mitchner fans - but Hawaii was a little dull.) <br />There are many character threads and stories in the book, but the two main ones are the story of a WWII cryptographer (Clancy style), and the story of his Silicon Valley grandson's pursuit of an offshore data center and advanced cryptography (Gibson style). Both threads are thoroughly engrossing. The book paces perfectly, it never gets too frentic or too dull.  <br />The character development is also done very well - Stevenson doesn't clutter the book with too many marginal characters besides his main ones and he makes most the characters very memorable. This leaves him lots of time to develop his main characters into complex and interesting people. <br />Stevenson's writing style is also very readable, yet not as flat as the standard supermarket fiction (or bad sci-fi for that matter). The different story threads are written in a different tone, and Stevenson uses his command of tone to provide even more character and plot development. For example, his savant WWI cryptographer thinks in mathmatical proofs, his modern-day cyberpunk in Tolkein-inspired metaphors. <BR> <BR>If I had a complaint about this book (I don't have many) it is that the ending leaves a little to be desired. I won't give anything away, but my overall impression with the last 200 or so pages of the book was that Stevenson got tired and just started typing out some text to finish the thing up. It's not a complete breakdown, but compared to the rest of the book it is a weakshowing.<br />Regardless, I still highly recommend this book to any cyberpunk fans, war story fans, or math geeks.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Dark as night, spare and subtle, 'The Man Comes Around\\" stands as Johnny Cash*s finest American Recordings album É and one of his best ever. As always, Cash is a powerful storyteller, even with his fragile, unsteady voice. Much has been made of  the cover of Nine Inch Nails* 'Hurt,\\" but don*t overlook 'I Hung My Head\\" (another death song in the tradition of 'Folsom Prison Blues\\" and 'Delia*s  Gone\\"), the chilling title track, a four-and-a-half-minute meditation on the Book of Revelation, and a tear-stained version of 'Bridge Over Trouble Water.\\" Cash sings each of these songs as if it were his last. Listen and be transformed.
B000002J1C|5.0|In my opinion, the best of Yes albums, though I could accept an argument for Close to the Edge.  Fade-out guitar solo on Starship Trooper is infectious.  Yours is no Disgrace has some great sterophonic effects, sounds great with head phones. After a few listenings, you'll find yourself chanting &quot;I've seen all good people turn their heads each day so satistfied I'm on my way.&quot;  A tight, clean album with memorable themes and melodies.  Great craftmanship and musicianship without the self-indulgence of some later albums, i.e. Topographic Oceans. Every musical bar of this album is forever etched on the hard drive of my brain. This is certainly a very significant and classic album in the evolution of progressive rock.
B00005JL0I|5.0|I have loved this movie from the time I saw it in 1967.  I was 7 years old at the time, although not understanding all I loved the images and the music.  As an adult, the humor is so witty.  Really a gem.  I cannot recommend Casino Royale enough.  The acting is on the mark - especially David Niven.  I have laughed and laughed, time after time at his comedic timing. And Deborah Kerr's performance is oh, so funny and wonderfully inspiring.  I fell in love with her wit and spunk.  Too funny!<br />As for the music - my, what can I say?  I bought the CD long ago and have loved the Burt Bacharach soundtrack.  Especially, &quot;The Look of Love&quot; by Dusty Springfield.  You won't find a finer rendering that evokes such wonderful emotion.<br />Let me say - Casino Royale is a keeper.
B0000019PA|5.0|This album of fuzzed-out pschedelic folk from Jeff Mangum, his second full-length, is one of the strangest, most beautiful and haunting pieces of work I've ever heard. It starts off with fabulously random opening lines: &quot;When you were young you were the King of Carrot Flowers.&quot; The opening riff sounds vaguely familiar and makes one wonder, Man, where the hell have I heard that before? <BR>  The album uses a brass section on many of the songs and their effects are not at all wasted. The horns lend a fiesta-like feel to some songs and make &quot;The Fool&quot; and &quot;Oh Comely&quot; sound like Sicilian funeral marches. There are also some extremely bizarre instruments used on this CD, like the bowed banjo, musical saw and the zanzithophone. But no matter how many strange sounds and textures all piled onto these songs, it also just sounds like Heff Mangum pouring out emotion through his voice and guitar.<BR>  Mangum sings his deranged, off-kilter folk-rock tunes in a coarse and expressive voice, which would fit all types of music but works perfectly here. His lyrics range from the surreal and fun, like &quot;Ghost&quot; and &quot;Holland 1945&quot;, to deeply personal reveries like those found on &quot;Two Headed Boy part 2.&quot; <BR>  &quot;In the Aeroplane Over the Sea&quot; also has delighfully weird and symbolic album art, which really helps establish the mood of the album.<BR>  Every single track is incredibly creative, but if I had to pick one track as my favorite, I'd probably choose the untitled tenth song. It's a hazy instrumental which blends bagpipes, &quot;Take Me Out to the Ballgame&quot;-style organ and a slide trombone into what sounds like a marching band ffrom the farthest reaches of space.<BR>  IN CONCLUSION: this is a must-have album for lovers of the bizarre and experimental. You will b greatly rewarded for owning this astonishing record
B000089RVX|5.0|If you are a casual reader, then STOP.  Turn off your computer and rush to your local music store.  As a musician, I am usually a jaded and harsh critic of new artists.  But this album is truly hypnotic.  Amy Lee is a sensational vocalist and admirably teams up with representatives of today's disgruntled youth to create what can only be described as a pure, dark, thick musical richness not seen since the Black Sabath explosion of the early 70's.  Certainly a slap in the face of over-sexed, brainless teenage pop albums, \\"Fallen\\" is a wild ride that has the rare distinction of being a \\"front to back\\" album.  This means that you can put it in your CD player, crank it up and enjoy without having to skip from song to song to find your favorites.  The album plays well the whole way through.  I would be shocked if \\"Fallen\\"  goes unmentioned at the next Grammy awards.  Shocked and dismayed.  To review:  Get it.  Listen to it.  Be changed.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Almost eight years have passed since \\"The Beatles Anthology\\" first premiered, heavily edited, on commercial television.<br /><br />Having viewed the expanded footage, first in the VHS version released in the mid-1990s -- and now the DVD package I finished viewing during the past three days (in what were ten of the most enthralling and fastest-moving hours I've spent in front of the tube) -- it can now be stated, without reservation, that \\"The Beatles Anthology\\" is a marvel, even for contemporaries who may be wondering \\"what the fuss was all about\\" in this tale of four Liverpool lads who, despite their origins many years before 1964, ruled the USA radio airwaves for only seven years (1964 through 1970).<br /><br />\\"Anthology\\" renders it impossible for viewers to dismiss the group's accomplishments, their output of consistent musical masterpieces during the 1960s. I won't get into the guts of this, all covered fabulously by previous Amazon reviewers.<br /><br />But I do want to add this about the 2003 version of \\"Anthology.\\" The special new features on disk #5 alone are worth getting this package all over again. With George Harrison now gone, the poignant \\"re-union and recollections\\" of the surviving members in 1994 for this documentary are on fuller display in previously unseen footage, and hence feel more meaningful to the viewer. They hang out on the grass, they jabber about stuff at the table, they swear and laugh. They play goofy music together in a room; they join their long-time producer George Martin, listening to studio outtakes on old reel-to-reel tapes. They're clearly enjoying themselves. We don't see as much \\"new\\" as we'd like, but we see enough to provide a sense of \\"closure,\\" knowing that before the Beatles went their separate ways again after 1994, each surviving member had acknowledged their collective accomplishments with arguably greater love and respect than they did previously, especially in public.<br /><br />While \\"on-the-fence\\" fans, journalists or historians -- might've wished for greater coverage about the more controversial aspects of the Beatles' reign, the fact is -- nothing major that is negative has been left out of \\"Anthology\\" that's glaring (or galling). Moreover, despite possessing final approval for this project, without the Beatles' participation, we might not have this, the final record of the their accomplishments, expressed from the perspective of middle-aged guys looking back, armed with wisdom.<br /><br />The unprecedented access the surviving Beatles gave for this production enables us to hear their own words about what happened to them, rightly or wrongly -- their triumphs and tragedies, their successes and failures -- warts and all. Equally amazing is hearing John Lennon's voice throughout the documentary, so intelligent, witty and cynical all at once, providing great insight as to their motivations for success, how surprised they were when it came and how much it ruined them. Yet, as Harrison admits, success allowed the Beatles to re-invent themselves, to experiment, pushing them into new territories that enhanced and engraved the towering legacy they left behind.<br /><br />So much has been written and recorded about the Beatles that it's gratifying to know, especially with respect to new information dealing with the bittersweet and heartbreaking efforts associated with the creation of the Fab Four's 1995 release, \\"Free as a Bird\\" (covered in greater detail in the 2003 version), that the \\"Anthology's\\" producers never had a problem with \\"lacking \\" material. If anything, given the ingenious cutting and editing, 10 hours on five disks still leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />Production values are top-flight. No expense was spared, no corners cut. \\"Anthology\\" looks and feels like a zillion dollars. The re-mastered DTS audio tracks are magnificent, and the ability to access subtitles enables viewers to pick up even \\"PG-13\\" mutterings with greater clarity, stuff cut out of the commercialtelevision version. Yeah, the Beatles, especially George and Ringo, let loose with swear words here and there, though not gratuitously, displaying unguarded emotions about what they loved and hated about being members of the world's most successful pop band.<br /><br />So after watching \\"Anthology\\" is it still fair, in 2003, to say the Beatles were indeed \\"the greatest?\\"  Were they the greatest even if you mildly admired them, and weren't a rabid fan?<br /><br />In my view, the answer is yes.  \\"Anthology's\\" pictures, interviews and songs support the theory that starbursts of genius are mostly seen in people who are young.  By the time the Beatles broke up in 1970, each member had just hit or was approaching 30.  They went out bitterly, but they also went out on top.<br /><br />By 1980, the year of John Lennon's murder, they seemed no longer embarrassed by their association with a worldwide pop culture phenomenon.  And it's quite exhilarating to hear the surviving members, especially Lennon (seen in archival, post-break-up footage), acknowledge somewhat modestly, despite myriad superstar musicians who have since followed, that in fact, as a team, they \\"did OK.\\"  As one of 'em says, \\"Yeah, I thought we did alright. We were a pretty good band.\\"<br /><br />Flash forward to 2003. Hearing their words, combined with stellar concert footage, interviews, rehearsal sessions filled with gaffes, news coverage of their exploits, the creation of their theatrical films, their growing maturity with lyrics and melodies -- solidifies what \\"objective\\" historians must now agree -- that the Beatles' place in history as one of the greatest artistic/creative collaborations of the ages is forever preserved.<br /><br />More than 40 years after the group's struggling days in Liverpool and Hamburg, it's indeed safer to declare, once again, that the Beatles and their spectacular accomplishments -- will be endlessly studied -- even centuries from now.  And this has gotta be beyond comforting for fans.ge and Ringo, let loose with swear words here and there, though not gratuitously, displaying unguarded emotions about what they loved and hated about being members of the world's most successful pop band.

B00008H2LB|3.0|My main problem with the CD is that it sounds pretty similar to the first cd.  I think Hybrid Theory has more quality tracks on it too.  Songs like faint have an original string thingie to it, but the rap part reminds me a lot of a song on Hybrid Theory.  It's a good cd, I just wish they differentiated it a bit more from Hybrid Theory
B00008J4P5|5.0|I had very high expectations for this record and was not disappointed.  It's not a perfect - not every idea works, not every song is a classic - but nobody else is breathing life into the tired corpse of rock and roll like Jack and Meg.<br />I'm reminded of Husker Du's incredible run in the mid-80's, when they kept relentlessly cranking out great albums and tunes and riffs and lyrics and vocals and live shows until we couldn't keep track anymore.<br />Forget about the carefully crafted image, the color scheme, the siblings-or-ex-spouses \\"rumors\\", the lack of a bass player - all that [stuff] is camouflage, meant to disguise music that's simple and subversive and difficult and stupidly enjoyable all at the same time.
B000002B5L|5.0|I don't care what anyone else says, this is the bottom line: THE SCORE IS ONE OF THE MOST LYRICALLY GENIUS ALBUMS OF THE 90s. Peoople who gave it bad reviews simply do not understand the true soul of hip hop. This album is a masterpiece, and if you truly love hip hop, you must give it a listen, bar none. Fugees rock!
B000088E6D|5.0|Once in a while I try out a CD based solely on song selection, producer, and packaging.  This one intruiged me, as I knew many of the songs, but never heard his voice before.  I must say I am more than impressed, and have been recommending this to anyone who enjoys top-notch, world-class vocals and production.  Buble's voice is clear, strong, and completely stylish for this genre, seeing as he's so young.  Suspend any preconceived notions you may have about somewhat big band/swing music (ala Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, etc.) and give MIchael Buble a listen.  I can't keep from enjoying this one time and time again.
B00006690G|5.0|This CD marks Eminem at his best- Angry, Funny, Real, Vindictive, and lyrically superb. Eminem creates an amalgam of the talents that he put together on his previous CDs, The Slim Shady LP and The Marshall Mathers LP. I Highly recommend this CD-for the fans, the haters, the parents, and anyone else whose heart is beating.
B00007AJGH|5.0|Animated movies have continued to improve successively with each passing year culminating with entire movies composed only of computer graphics.<br />Who Framed Roger Rabbit is an exceptional fusion of live action and animation that helped break the mold.  The continuity of the scenes are so fluid that you can't distinguish the seperation of the live from the animated.  There are no computer graphics whatsoever and all the animation is hand drawn which is pretty incredible.<br />If you're one of the viewers, like myself, who opted to avoid the first release of this movie on DVD for something better, then you know that the Vista Series release is something special and a wonderful 2 disc set at a great price.<br />Split between one disc for children and families and one disc for special feature enthusiasts, there is enough material here to keep everyone pleased for hours.  The demonstrations of the melding technique of live action and animation is especially interesting.<br />The movie itself is vibrantly colorful and crystal clear.  DTS surround sound is superb and compliments the whole experience.  Filled with great humor from start to finish and a huge cast of cartoon characters from all genre's past and present, this movie is a top-notch crowd pleaser all around.  This is a great addition to any DVD collection and comes highly recommended to all.

B000089A07|3.0|Let's get real folks, the only reason \\"Red Dragon\\" was made was because it gives moviegoers a chance to see Anthony Hopkins in the memorable role of Hannibal Lecter for the third time. And once again, he gives a fine, if not enjoyably creepy performance as one of the most famous villains in screen history. \\"Red Dragon\\" is an interesting film because it is a rare opportunity to see the same novel (Thomas Harris' first of the Hannibal trilogy including \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and \\"Hannibal\\") made into a film twice within the same era. Granted, Michael Mann's version \\"Manhunter\\" came out in 1986 (was it that long ago?), but it's memory is still fresh enough where one wonders why this film was made at all.<br />Edward Norton is a fine actor, but I agree with an earlier reviewer, he's just too young for this role. He never adequately displays the type of burnout angst required. Oddly enough, on paper the exceptional cast recruited for \\"Red Dragon\\" is in many ways superior to the cast for \\"Manhunter\\" (William Petersen, Joan Allen, Dennis Farina, Stephen Lang) but in almost every circumstance, the performances from the first film are superior. Even Ralph Fiennes, an extraordinarily gifted actor in the role of the serial killer dubbed \\"The Tooth Fairy,\\" does not leave as much of an impression as Tom Noonan from \\"Manhunter.\\" Ironically, the greatest triumph of \\"Red Dragon\\" is Fiennes' brave, if not heartbreaking, performance. He adds an uncomfortable human element to an absolutely evil character and frankly steals the show.<br />\\"Red Dragon\\" is a good Hopkins-as-Hannibal thriller (superior to \\"Hannibal,\\" far, far inferior to \\"Silence of the Lambs\\"), but one wonders why so much effort and resource went in to making this film when Mann's innovative and stylish \\"Manhunter\\" covered this same territory in such a satisfying, complete manner. The answer is obvious. Hopkins said \\"Yes, I will play Hannibal again.\\" And so viewers can once again sit back and be force fed a deja vu recipe of Hollywood formula filmmaking. If anything, \\"Red Dragon\\" proves just how fine a film Mann's \\"Manhunter\\" truly was.

B00006JDVV|2.0|Talk about major disppointments and wasted potential!  Here we have a very interesting (and promising) opening scene where a dragon is accidentally unearthed in an underground London excavation site and escapes.  THEN, the director (for whatever...reasons) immediately segues into a brief newspaper montage, describing how more dragons have emerged and eventually annhiliated most of the world.THEN, it's twenty years later.  WHAT?  COME AGAIN?  Let's rewind a moment, and allow me to ask a really dumb question:  HOW COME THAT WASN'T THE STORY?  It doesn't sound too dull to me.  That's what those deceptive posters and trailers conveyed.

I would have also been very curious to SEE how the human race fought them - and lost (as chillingly depicted in that TIME mag cover of NYC in flaming ruins with those ominous words:  THE END?).  That was the suspenseful and terrifying film I wanted to see, instead of this dismal effort which only boasts fleeting moments of action.  Also, WHERE WERE THE DRAGONS?

B00008CLOA|5.0|'Dark Side of the Moon' is one of those rare rock albums that continues to grow on me. <BR>I was 14 when it first came out, and to be frank, it was a bit of a let-down after all the delays that beset its release. The album just didn't seem to contain a great riff-based track to rival 'One of these Days' from the preceding LP, MEDDLE. Production values didn't seem to be very important to a 14-year-old, and anyway, who was this lowly engineer called Alan Parsons?<br />I never bought it in the LP format -- relying instead on a cassette recording of a friend's copy. I first bought it in the late 80s on CD, and that for me was the moment of sonic revelation. The care that Parsons and the band had put into the recording back in 1972 suddenly seemed astonishingly worthwhile. (Compare the clarity of this recording to other remastered recordings from the period e.g. Joe Gastwirt's desperate attempts to clear away the grime from Yes's CLOSE TO THE EDGE.)<br />And now in 2003, I've purchased the 30th anniversary CD. It comes as a hybrid CD/SACD -- which means that it will play in both SACD players and normal CD players. I have a SACD player, but it isn't wired up to the amp for 5.1 sound, so I'm not playing the album in its best environment. In this restricted hi-fi configuration, I have to admit that I'm slightly disappointed that there seems to be no further sonic revelation. (This disappointment provides some motivation for me to get my amp properly wired up!)<br />However, I sense that the band have tweaked the instrumentation -- and even some of the sampled dialogue that introduces the album -- slightly. None of these minor changes are for the worse, and they provide some intrigue for sald old gits like myself.<br />The booklet provides no additional liner notes, but includes many photos of the merchandising that has accompanied this album over the years.<br />We can only begin to guess what the 40th anniversary version will look like in 2013. Presumably it will include holographic projections of the band performing the album in 3D in your living room. Shine on!
B00006JDVV|2.0|Talk about major disppointments and wasted potential!  Here we have a very interesting (and promising) opening scene where a dragon is accidentally unearthed in an underground London excavation site and escapes.  THEN, the director (for whatever lame reasons) immediately segues into a brief newspaper montage, describing how more dragons have emerged and eventually annhiliated most of the world.THEN, it's twenty years later.  WHAT?  COME AGAIN?  Let's rewind a moment, and allow me to ask a really dumb question:  HOW COME THAT WASN'T THE STORY?  It doesn't sound too dull to me.

B00006L7XQ|5.0|When this album was released last year, Cash caught some flack from the professional press for the sheer number of well-known covers (\\"In My Life,\\" \\"Desperado\\", \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\\" among others).  These reviewers seemed to intimate that Cash was going the lazy route, digging up bits from earlier, better sessions.<br />That's not the case.<br />What we have here is a fifteen song meditation on his own mortality.  From the opening title track with its Book of Revelation-inspired imagery, to \\"Hurt,\\" through the repeated theme of the dying breed (\\"I Hung My Head,\\" \\"Sam Hall,\\" \\"Desperado,\\" \\"Streets of Laredo\\"), Cash lends his time-worn baritone to these songs, and their cumulative power builds throughout the album until we reach \\"We'll Meet Again,\\" which offers a faint hope of redemption (think location, location, location).<br />Musically, it's not that different from American III...sparse, acoustic arrangements with some piano and organ that throw Mr. Cash's voice into high relief, making it all the more effective and touching.<br />And on a purely personal note, if you can listen to this album in its entirety without tearing up at least once, well, you must have a heart of stone...<br />PS>  2 small things:  It's not without its refreshing Man In Black rebel moments (\\"Sam Hall,\\" \\"The Man Comes Around\\"), and \\"Hurt\\" is what a friend and I used to call a fifteen dollar song:  worth the price of the CD just to own that ONE song.  But this CD is so much more.
B000083E79|4.0|We all know that Cher is one of the most important figures in show business. The had won a Grammy award and an Oscar.<BR>When it comes to music we can say that she's one of the best and this cd is a reflex of that success.<BR>In this cd we find her whole music history of hits from the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's. <BR>From the 60's we it has hits such as: &quot;I got you babe&quot;. From 70's &quot;Dark lady&quot; and &quot;Take me home&quot;. From the 80's &quot;I found some one&quot; and &quot;If I could turn back time&quot; and her lates hits like &quot;Belive&quot; or &quot;Song for the lonely&quot;.<BR>But I also must say that to hits are not included here and those are &quot;WE all sleep alone&quot; (I can't understand why they didn't add it when it was a hit and Cher sang it in all her concerts. It's a pitty) and &quot;Walking in Memphies&quot;. I like all the songs in this album and love them but I'm rating it with 4 stars because they didn't add &quot;We all sleep alone&quot;.
B000084T18|5.0|50 Cent's new CD, Get Rich or Die Trying is perhaps one of his best efforts yet. He teams up with Dr.Dre to put out a very, very good CD. <br />First of all, In Da Club, his second single isn't that good of a song. It's overrated and if you judge him by that song then your crazy. Most real rap fans know that that song is the Without Me of the CD, the song that makes pop fans buy the CD so he can make 3x the profit. It's not a bad song, but it's not as good as Many Men or If I Can't.<br />The CD is well-rounded, and the best songs are in the middle. Numbers 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 14 stand out as the best in my mind. The rest are good, but not quite great like these tracks. When 50 gets an awesome beat like in number 10 he tears it up. <br />If you like this CD by him, then I'd buy his others espically Guess Who's Back. Classic CD right there. <br />Anywho, 50 Cent is now a rap superstar and is tearing Ja Rule to pieces. He is real gangsta rap and if you don't like gangsta rap then stay away from this.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This is a brilliant CD. Hands down. Now, I certainly do welcome other opinions -- well, except for the guy that rated it 1 star and said go pick up a Kylie Minogue record instead -- but it seems to me that many of these 1,2,3 star reviews are coming from people who want another White Blood Cells retread.<br />Well, no one's getting that. The White Stripes wouldn't be the White Stripes if indeed they did put out a carbon copy. For those that want that, go listen to some more Backstreet Boys if you want predictability.<br />This IS a harder edged album, this IS a less poppy, hooky album. That doesn't mean it's necessarily bad. It's just a different record.<br />It's amazing to me how people complain how [bad] and boring music is these days but then insist that each album sound like the last. You can't have your cake and eat it too.
B000002H4Q|5.0|Wow, now this is an amazing album... There are many highlights to this cd... But I do have my favorties so I'll tell you a little about them. Where shall we start? The begining is a good place.. And the 1st song \\"The Kiss\\" was a great intro to the entire cd.<BR>   With slowly building drum beats, drawn out guitar riffs and of course Smith's own unique hurricane of a voice it's basically the 'theme song' if you will for this album. 'Torture' has Robert in pain, and thinking of something hurting Robert almost puts me into tears but it's a different kind of pain.. Like he sounds sexy as hell and I'm sure it can turn a lot of girls like me on. Sorry, I know for about 15 years Robert's been happily married to his high-school sweetheart (awww!!), but we can still dream right?! The song is absolutley on fire.. The snake-pit slowly builds with intenseity and is shall I say, hypnotic? <BR>   Many Cure songs have this special quality that they alone tend to own. And of course, if your a Cure fan you should be shot in the head if you don't know this one. I think it's their most well-known songs.. Of course I'm talkin' about \\"Just like Heaven\\". Oh yeah, by the way that was the 1st Cure song I heard. This lovely song does NOT need an introduction, for obvious reasons. 1 being that I can not write a description that would do it justice, and 2 it was made for Mary and that alone is the sweetest thing ever... Number 9. \\"All I want\\" is among my fav. songs. I totally love the Bass part(I'm very partial to Bass parts as you can see because well, I'm a Bassist myself!!), in it and of course it's a great rock song. The drums sound amazing as well. In my eyes it has no flaws whatsoever, it has good length and the lyrics are great. \\"One more time\\" made me cry the 1st time I heard it.. It's so sweet. \\"Like Cockatoos\\" is very mysterious and makes you feel like your walking through a dream. \\"Icing sugar\\", whoa man... It blew me away, and still does. With a fast tepo it showcases the Cure's energy and talent for sure. I just wish it was a little longer in time. <BR>   \\"The Perfect girl\\" is another one of my favorite songs. The music puts you into a good mood in seconds. \\"A Thousand Hours\\" is another beautiful and sweet song, it's hard not to fall inlove with it. \\"Shiver and Shake\\" has you on the edge of your seat, and to this day I haven't heard anyone that can sing like Robert. But \\"Fight\\" ends this wonderful album with strong lyrics and powerful riffs to back it up. A great end. Take it for me and everyone else who has reviewed this, take no time to think about it because that's not needed. Buy this as soon as you can. Definitley reccomended, 5 stars all the way!!!!

B00005J6UP|5.0|When my sister and I were introduced to THE GOONIES about 10 years ago, by our dad, we fell in love with it. My sister and I have watched this movie literally 100 times, and no matter how many times we've seen it, we still continue to get captured into the excitement, adventure and fun the movie holds. For Christimas this year, we got the movie on DVD and its better then ever. Including the original movie, it has a commentary with the cast of the movie, a music video the cast did with Cyndi Lauper, outtakes, the orginial trailer and a look at the making of the goonies. Whenever our friends come over, we ask them, &quot;Have you ever seen 'the goonies'?&quot; And if they hadn't, we introduce them to our favorite movie. <BR>When Mikey (Sean Astin) and his friends, the goonies, encounter a treasure map, they embark on the adventure of a lifetime. With characters like Mouth,(Corey Feldman), Data (Ke Huy Kuan), Chunk (Jeff Cohen) and Mikey's older brother, Brand (Josh Brolin), and the girl goonies, Andy(Kerri Green) and Stef(Martha Plimpton) the jokes are endless. As they out run the bad guys, dodge the booby traps, and find the treasure of One-eyed-Willy, its a thrill a minute adventure that will capture the hearts of young and old for generations to come.
B000002JPA|4.0|After an rather sub par first album (When Dream And Day Unite), Dream Theater took control of their musical identity. Former vocalist Charlie Dominiqui was fired and replaced with that high-pitched Canadian, James LaBrie. Their first album together, Images &amp; Words, is an above-average disc and the perfect starting point to Dream Theater (it was the first album of theirs I heard). <BR>     Throughout the years, the band has come along way, releasing classics like the ultra-heavy Awake, the epic A Change Of Seasons, and their arguable masterpiece, the 1999 concept album Scenes From A Memory. However, as what is probably their most prog-oriented work, I&amp;W holds up quite nicely. Containing their biggest hits and longest-staying songs on the set list, some songs are better than others.<br />&quot;Pull Me Under&quot; 10/10- Despite the fact it has a fairly simple structure (intro, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, solo, chorus, outro) and is in 4/4, this song is a mood-setting masterwork. Intelligent lyrics and good lung belting from LaBrie are blended with some Slayer-esque metal predating Awake by two years.<br />&quot;Another Day&quot; 6/10- Deep down, it's an eighties-style power ballad, and gets old quick.<br />&quot;Take The Time&quot; 8/10- In my opinion, this the first song with the &quot;James vs. Dream&quot; problem: Excellent music with SOME DAMN ANNOYING VOCALS! James raps and squeals, but the band makes up for it.<br />&quot;Surrounded&quot; 7/10- Probably one of the more forgettable songs on the album.<br />&quot;Metropolis Pt. 1&quot; 10/10- Easily one of the bands best loved songs. Beautiful and complex, this is essentialy the suite of Scenes From A Memory<br />&quot;Under A Glass Moon&quot; 8/10- A heavy-riffing track that sounds like something off Awake. Very good song.<br />&quot;Wait For Sleep&quot; 6/6- Another forgettable tune.<br />&quot;Learning To Live&quot; 9/10- A great song boasting what is probably former keyboardist Kevin Moore's best work on the album. The first minute is great, but the song spirals into a amazing conclusion to the album.<br />Although some songs aren't that great, the others more than make up for it. James LaBrie's voice is strong and is only annoying in parts of &quot;Pull Me Under&quot; and virtually all of &quot;Take The Time&quot;. Mike Portnoy and John Petrucci give their usual stellar performance, but at this point it seems John Myung hasn't really gotten to his peak, as his playing is rather simplistic and improved drastically later on. Plus, Kevin Moore's keyboard playng, outside of a few highlights, is pretty simple as well. All in all, this is a fine album and contains some of DT's finest songs.
B00008NRI8|4.0|Its not surprising that Hugh Grant gets the high marks.  After all this is a woman's picture and he has dimples and a British accent.  And while I wish her well, Sandra Bullock has more in common with Tyne Daly than Audrey Hepburn.<br />But the real star here is the script which is really quite good.  Sure, you know the ending but at least you get to laugh along the way.
0767836324|5.0|I watched this movie when I was really young and I loved it then. I watched it again today and I love it still! <br />Peter Pan, having been put up for adoption in the &quot;real world&quot; by Wendy and grown up, is now Peter Panny, a lawyer who is too busy to appreciate his wife and two children, Jack and Maggie. Peter goes to his daughter's play, but is on his cellphone the entire time. He compeltely misses Jack's baseball game, and when Jack is bitter about it and acting childish, Peter tells him to 'grow up.'<br />Then Captain Hook kidnaps Peter's children as revenge, Tink whisks Peter off to Never Never land - where he firmly believes he's hallucinating. He remembers nothing of being Peter Pan, the lost boys, Captain Hook, or anything. In order to save his children, he must find the child within himself. And the only way to accomplish that is by having the Lost Boys and Tink help him. He must learn to stop being the selfish lawyer who is too busy for everybody and start being a person who appreciates life and sees everything as an adventure. Meanwhile, Jack is taking the opposite route and giving up his childhood while being held captive. <BR>The movie is a wonderful tale, and it brings a new life to the Peter Pan story. The visuals are outstanding and the movie does an awesome job at creating a real, live Never Never Land where there are mermaids, paint fights, pirates, and the tickety tock of the crock.<br />The acting is superb, and I don't think they could've picked anybody better to play Peter Pan and Captain Hook than Robin Williams and Hoffman. <br />It's an all around great film for the whole family. It gives even the most cynical of adults the hope that maybe we can all find the child within us and learn to live that way.
6304539258|5.0|The staggering success of \\"Phantom Menace\\" and \\"Attack of the Clones\\" motivated me to watch \\"A New Hope\\" for the first time.<br />I was reluctant to become a \\"Star Wars\\" fan after growing up devoted to \\"Battlestar Galactica,\\" but I can safely say I've come around.<br />From a narrative standpoint, it's difficult to compose a summary of the saga--because it's being told out of order. Key developments occur in Episode III, which hasn't been released yet! \\"A New Hope\\" is the fourth film in the series, but it was actually the first one to be made. This was a bold choice by the creator, a talented man named George Lucas. You have to watch three other movies before getting any explanation of \\"the Force,\\" but this contributes to the mysterious, etherial nature of a Jedi Knight's power.<br />I liked this movie a lot, but I feel like I've skipped ahead by watching it, so I'm not going to see \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" or \\"Return of the Jedi\\" until after Episode III comes out. I don't want any more surprises to be spoiled.<br />Familiar characters from Episodes I and II appear, including Obi-Wan Kenobi (he's called \\"Ben\\" in this film), R2-D2, and Jabba the Hutt. Obi-Wan Kenobi is much older in this film, which indicates that a long time has passed since the Clone Wars. A new main character is introduced, named Luke Skywalker. Since his last name is the same as Anakin Skywalker's (from the first two episodes), and he lives on Tatooine with Owen and Beru (from Episode II), I'm guessing that Anakin is the lost father that Luke repeatedly refers to. Apparently, Luke's father was killed by the villain Darth Vader, which I'm guessing will happen in Episode III. <br />Darth Vader is a good villain, though he doesn't fight as well as Darth Maul (from Episode I), and he talks a lot more. Apparently he was once a pupil of Obi-Wan's before he turned to evil. I'm guessing that young Boba Fett, angry that his father Jango was killed by Jedi in Episode II, pretends to be Obi-Wan's pupil along with Anakin, then reveals his evil intention (all this would happen in Episode III). That's why Master Vader wears a helmet (Jango Fett wore a helmet).<br />It's fun to see Jabba the Hutt again; I liked him in Episode I. He appears in a scene with a new character named Han Solo (a young Harrison Ford!), because Solo owes him some money. There's an earlier scene where Han Solo is confronted by, then shoots, one of Jabba's bounty hunters, but it doesn't add anything to the story, and I like the Jabba scene better. Plus another character with a helmet like Jango Fett's appears with Jabba. I'd be willing to guess that it's Boba's son (or a clone), who will end up helping Luke and Han fight his evil father. Maybe he's a spy, or something--keeping an eye on Tatooine.<br />C-3PO also returns, but doesn't seem to remember Tatooine...which is strange because I didn't know he'd ever left! It must happen in Episode III, and his memory gets erased, or something. I'm sure George Lucas has it all worked out; the \\"Star Wars\\" saga is a carefully planned tapestry of relationships and events.<br />\\"A New Hope\\" is pretty good, although the some of the special effects look a little out-dated, because they weren't done with CGI. It's a little strange that a few decades have gone by since Episodes I and II, but everything looks older instead of newer. I guess this is meant to underscore the hardships that people face living under the rule of the Empire.<br />Luke and Han team up to save a princess who's been captured by Darth Vader, and we see the final results of the ultimate weapon hinted at in Episode II. So, Luke finds himself getting the excitement he always wanted, and he makes new friends along the way.<br />For the most part, I don't like the new characters as much as the people from the first two Episodes. Princess Leia is an uptight, crabby re-hash of Queen Amidala. Han Solo has a sidekick named Chewie, who attempts to be as funny and likable as Jar-Jar Binks, but doesn't even come close. And Han Solo cracks a lot of jokes, which takes away from the seriousness of the situation.<br />Still, it's a well-done sequel--almost as good as the first ones...and I can't wait to see the next two (and the one right before it)!
B00008H2LE|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I popped this CD into my stereo.  As I've said before, I really liked their first album, but thought it was very overrated.  Almost every song on that album was being played on the radio non-stop!  And I wasn't too impressed when they decided to release a remix album.  So, I was very cautious when I picked up Linkin Park's 'Meteora.'  All of that worrying was for nothing, though.  I think this albums a masterpiece and is so much better than their first album.<br />You can really tell how much they've improved; in their music playing, song writing, and singing.  The songs have more depth to them and are much more complex than half the songs on the first album.  They successfully combine industrial, rap, and alternative all together to make up a great package of very entertaining music.<br />Every song is great.  I could not find one song that I disliked.  Of course, I have my favorites and ones I listen to more than others, but this is an album I can pop into my car stereo and drive without having to fumble around with the track buttons.  My favorite songs are 'don't stay,' 'somewhere I belong,' 'breaking the habit,' 'lying from you,' 'easier to run,' 'numb,' session,' 'figure .09,' and 'from the inside.' But really, they're all very good songs.<br />My only complaint, and its really a small one, is that the album is really short.  Not even forty minutes, I don't think.  While I think this is the only album's weak point, it's not a very big weakness.  I'd rather have an album that is short and sweet than an album that just keeps dragging on and on.  Still, I don't think a few more minutes would've hurt the CD any.<br />The limited edition version is neat because it comes with a bonus DVD that goes into the making of 'Meteora.'  It was pretty interesting to see them at work and what went into this album.  The CD also includes some neat extras that can be accessed from your computer.<br />'Meteora' does more than be a successful second album (I don't count the remix one as their second album), it goes above and beyond.  You can tell that the band put a lot of hard work and effort into this, which is why it didn't come out right after the first one.  If you like Linkin Park, chances are you will fall in love with this album.  I was very, VERY surprised and impressed.  Hopefully they can keep it up, and hopefully those evil radio stations don't overplay these songs like they did with the first one, although I fear that's a certainty.  Great album, great band, great music.second album (I don't count the remix one as their second album), it goes above and beyond.

B0000797IO|2.0|I'm not sure what I was thinking when I rented this tragedy of a movie. I was seduced by the positive remarks ensconced on the cover of the movie, I suppose. I can't think of any other reason why I would pick up this -- otiose, dull, exasperating -- movie.<br />Jennifer Aniston stars as a bored girl exhausted by her supermarket job, and her pot-smoking dull and lifeless husband. Entranced by the gothic self-styled Holden from Salinger's <i>Catcher in the Rye</i>, Aniston's character decides to risk everything -- which is pretty much nothing -- and have a fling. The fling turns into one of those languishing romances where the nerd-boy threatens to commit suicide should she leave him. Meanwhile her husband's best friend catches her at a motel with this kid and threatens to squeal should she fail to sleep with him as well.<br />Lameness escapes in every minute of this mangled, lifeless waste of precious time. Dull and pedantic, the character's go through a mindless dance with forgetable scenarios and a plot so thickly-lined with stupidity it leaves you with a sense of general dread for not having stopped the insanity when you still had a chance.<br />Avoid this movie. It is _terrible_.
B00008H2LE|5.0|Linkin park have always been a favorite to since they were underground(By the way its a same so many posers have gotten to them, anyway) and they have grown a lot since then.  Chesters and Mike's rapping on this cd definetly make them an individual and dignified group.most songs like nobody's listening sound alot like soe of their underground songs.  Out of the 4 cd's that they have released (Hybrid Theory EP, Hybrid Theory, Reanimation, and Hybrid theory in other countries) this cd is not quite their best since it doesn't compared to Hybrid Theory's controdiction, but definetly showing a sign of how much they are taking their music seriously.  If you are a teen dealing with teen problems such as parents neglecting you and not fitting in with everyone, this is definetly a great cd for you.  I am 14 and it has helped me understand the death of my grandparents, and my father.  It is truley a great cd... And splurge a lil for the extra bonus they were interesting :)

B000002J03|5.0|By music i mean that this is good now matter what you listen. Soem complain it aint like heavy metal. So what? Its still freaking good. Some complain that LZ stole some songs from african american blues singers (beacuse black sounds so racist). Well leme tell you that even though it aint there original stuff its still good. People are just to mad of some small issues when they could be enjoyng some of the best music ever made. Some even complain about the cd having to many sex references. So what? It was just a bit more early than AC/DC(who are also one of the greates band in the world, even if they do use dirty language). People just calm done and listen to music...see? its all good.Now to the song reviews. <br />(Note: for all off you who dont know, LZ recorded this CD practicly in just a couple of months so you cant expect them not to take influnce from other artist on the way)<br />1-Whole Lotta love, though not as talented as some of LZ's other songs, it is still rather cachy and quite fun to hear.<br />2-What is and what should never be, just a dramatic,fun, soft song which doesnt loose its flavor<br />3-The Lemon Song, profanity aside, its one of LZ best and most versitale songs on the CD<br />4-Thank You, pretty much there first 'difrent' kind of song. Its pretty good for all it goes.<br />5-Heartbreaker, though it may sound boring at first, the song quikly caches up and delivers Jimi Page's loud solo, which is one of his best only toped by Dazed and confused<br />6-Living Loving Maid (She's just a woman), more of a pop-rock song, though at least its better than adding nothing<br />7-Ramble On, this song always gets me on Jimi's alienish guitar riff. Its probably one of the best in the CD. I think theres reference to Lord of the Rings somewhere in the lyrics (though i may be hearing wrong).<br />8-Moby Dick, John Bonham does what any drumer in the world would like to do, a full song solo. Doesnt sound to bad and helps solidify him as one freaking fast and good drummer.<br />9-Bring it Home, weird in the beginning yet gets really good when Jimi enters (kind of get the feeling all these songs would be nothing whitout him)<br />Final Word:If you think that you might not like this album beacuse of all the bad reviews (and i mean bad) then just listen to the short outtakes here so you can see if you like this music. If not then waste your time writting here.
B00005JKZT|4.0|Being an avid fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy I delightfully snapped up a ticket for the opening night in Austraila, and while I enjoyed the movie a great deal and have seen it several times, the changes made to the story slacken the wind in it's sails a bit for me. <br />There are scores of minor details which were changed for no apparent reason, especially in the unfolding of the battle for Helms Deep, these include; <br />- Eomer off fighting in the north when he in fact was behind the wall fighting along side Aragorn, which played importantly in the true story by serving to further the friendship which develops between these two. It was also Eomer who accompanied Aragorn to the outside of the Hornburgh to fight off the orcs assailing the gate, Gimli was there unbeknown to them until he saved the two when they turned to retreat and were grabbed from behind.<br />- Gimli retreating from the wall to the Hornburgh tower, when he retreated to the caves amidst the thick of the fighting. Furthermore the way that the character of Gimli has been changed for him to serve simply as comedy relief I think is an affront to the courageous dwarf which is portrayed in Tolkien's masterpiece.<br />- The Ents and their part in the conflict was the most drastically changed part of this battle. For starters the Ents agreed to help int he struggle after the Entmoot, and in the original story the Ents lead a force of Hurons (these are wild and violent tree-creatures who the Ents lead) to block off the entrance of the ravine containing the deep. Then at dawn when the horn of the deep is blown and the king rides out to meet the Orcs while Gandalf arrives with forces from the north to assail the beseigers flank, the Orcs retreat only to find this forest blocking their way. In a panic they wildy try to retreat at a run through it, all of them once disappearing under the dark canopy of the forest never to come out again. I agree with what has been said in a lot of other reviews, the Ents seem to have been dumbed down from the old and wise creatures which they are in the book.<br />Now the translation of this literary masterpiece to cinema is no meagre task, yet I am left aghast wondering why Peter Jackson chose to change so many details seemingly for no reason and to add whole scenes which never occur in the book at the exclusion of pieces of the original story.<br />What am I talking about you ask? I am talking about the time wasted furthering the love story between Aragron and Arwen, along side the added in scenes of Frodo and Sam being taken to Osgilliath by Faramir and Aragorn being lost persumed dead. These scenes do nothing to further the story and were not part of the original tale yet they have been created and thrown in, why do you ask? Well only Jackson himself can answer that one. I mean we have these completely newly created scenes put in place which waste time which could have been used better. How do you ask? Well the movie was cut short, it ends with the two sides of Gollum plotting to do away with Sam and Frodo. Yet this is quite a way from the end of the book which concludes with the climatic cliffhanger involving Shelob, I'm not going to detail it here though, don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read the book. This was my supreme disappointment with the movie, I could overlook all the other changes but the story being cut short really bit it in the tail for me  because it just made the movie feel incomplete. Which I'm sure it also did to all those who have read the book. I oh so wanted to see the visual rendering of Shelob, but I guess I'll have to wait now. Further this clifhanger would have made for a much more grander ending I beleive, and cutting it short is probably the worst decision PJ made with this film.<br />I know there are people who have been telling us 'Tolkein Purists' to stop complaining in their reviews, well I say that jus as they are entitled to their opinion I am also entitled to mine and this is it;<br />Aside from the many changes to the core story, it is undeniable that The Two Towers is an excellent film and a good continuation of the series, the cinematography is beautiful, the effects, particularly the rendering of Gollum are astounding and the musical score powerful and moving.

Totally ignoring the fact that this part of the story has been named  The Two Towers for nearly 60 years, they claimed that the movie was only being called The Two Towers to garnish hype from the tragic events of 9/11. They even have a website up, but since you can't display website addresses I can't give it to you. Just do a google search on \\"The Two Towers name change\\" or something along those lines and you will find there site, look closely because this is an excellent example of hyper sensitiviy and crackpot thinking in contemporary times.
B00008972S|5.0|As someone who's watched West Side Story countless times, I wondered if the new special edition DVD would be worth the price ....  I decided to rent it first before deciding whether or not to buy.  My verdict: I HAVE to own this DVD!<br />The film is so visually appealing.  As explained in the special features, color - particularly the use of red - was an important factor in creating the look of the movie.  The color has transferred beautifully to the DVD.  My only qualm, and it's minor at that, is the sound in a few of the songs.  I noticed it in the VHS and original DVD version so it's not a problem with this DVD, but the octave in some of the songs is so high that the sound seems to blur during a few notes, usually when Maria is singing.  It doesn't take away from the movie at all; I was just hoping they would have been able to fix it.<br />The special features, especially the documentary featuring cast and crew, are such a treat.  The interviews with the cast and crew show a different side of everything that went into making the movie.  For example, I never knew that Natalie Wood (Maria) and Richard Beymer (Tony) didn't get along in real life.  It was also great to finally hear Natalie Wood's original vocals.   The highlight of the feature was the cast itself - to see Beymer (Tony) and Russ Tamblyn (Riff) who I haven't really seen since West Side Story, and the incomparable Rita Moreno (Maria).  Get this DVD tonight!

B000089RVX|5.0|Well, when I saw Daredevil, the best song by far in that movie was Bring Me To Life by Evanescence. When I purchesed Fallen, I was amazed. The lyrics in this CD are brilliant, along with the mixture of piano and guitar, make this a must buy for anyone who appreciates good music.
B000088DTS|5.0|Exquisite songwriting, great band, lush production and a fantastic voice make this a \\"must have\\". Out of the 14 tracks I rate 11 as being outstanding.
B00008H2LB|5.0|It takes a good band to make 2 CDs. It takes a better band to top their first CD. Linkin Park did it, by far. Meteora opens up with a great song, Don't Stay, with a beat that won't let you forget why you bought this CD. Every song on this album let's me know I didn't waste my money. Buy this if you are a true fan of LP.
0316666343|2.0|After all the hype, I was disappointed with this book--big time. Page after page of depressing post-death fallout. The book had its good points. The descriptions were well written. Some of the characters were very believable, but sorry, I didn't buy the murderer as a believable person, nor the detective--Does this guy *ever* follow-up any of the leads he's given, or was he just there to be wooden and solemn? And a couple of the subplots were so unbelievable I almost pitched the book across the room--I'm talking about that scene in the mall. I don't believe that the mother of a girl who'd been abducted and murdered would leave her young son alone at a communal playground in the mall.<BR>   Unfortunately, I approached this book expecting there to be a *story*, rather than a just a literary collection of scenes. I expected the murder to be solved--since it wasn't, I don't understand why I had to bother reading all that rambling about the life of the murderer after the murder. Why put in all the relevant clues that could have been followed up but weren't? Who cares about where the body was hidden if it was never found? Why waste the reader's time putting those details in?<BR>  And the dialogue: Try reading it out loud. I cringed for the author in several places.<BR>  I gave my copy of this book away.
0743244249|3.0|Only 10 pages had turned before the gorgonzola was rolling around in my gob again, three years since it went in, and I pondered how the only thing worse than reading James Joyce is reading other writers trying to write like James Joyce.<br />On one April day in 2000 I sat  in Davy Byrne's pub on Dublin's Duke Street, sharing a gorgonzola sandwich with the ghost of Leopold Bloom and chasing Joyce's \\"ineluctable modality of the visible,\\" which was invisible. Perhaps it was the Liffey fog or the Guinness. And, by the hazy way, I was proudly becoming one of only 74 people worldwide who have actually finished \\"Ulysses,\\" an experimental story based on an ancient story.<br />Don DeLillo is apparently another. His new odyssey-come-lately, \\"Cosmopolis,\\" is an ode to Joyce in a new key, but an old cant. It resonates with the same disjunctive, unsettling rhythm of Joyce's 1922 novel, but lacks the texture, orality and genuine humanity. But take heart: It's easier to read -- DeLillo is a consummate master of poetic language -- and it's shorter by hundreds of pages.<br />DeLillo's cast of characters rivals Joyce's, too. Packer's day begins when he bumps into his newlywed bride of 22 days, an aloof poet-heiress, in traffic. He continues his odyssey with various paramours and business advisers (and sometimes the line between them is very vague, indeed), a doctor who examines his asymmetrical prostate in the backseat of the limo, his stump-necked security chief who worries an assassin lurks around every corner and ... well, an assassin lurking around the corner.<br />Compare and contrast: Joyce's hero, advertising salesman Leopold Bloom, sets out across Dublin on a June day in 1904, a deliberate spoof of mythology wrapped in social realism.<br />\\"I've put in so many enigmas and puzzles that it will keep the professors busy for centuries,\\" James Joyce once crowed about \\"Ulysses.\\" That didn't stop Aldous Huxley from calling it \\"one of the dullest books ever written.\\" One college English professor described his time with \\"Ulysses\\" this way: \\"It was like having a rib ripped out of my body, being beaten with it, raped with it, and then being forced to eat it.\\"<br />So why regurgitate this book based upon the most familiar story in human history, Homer's Odyssey? While it helps to know the Joyce's \\"Ulysses\\" was intended to be a comedy -- albeit a \\"comedy\\" only in the tragic Irish sense of the word -- it is one of the most famous books never read.<br />Comes now Don DeLillo, a National Book Award and PEN/Faulkner winner, with his redux of a redux of an endlessly redone original. DeLillo is no Joyce, which is probably good. He's also no Vonnegut, whose four- and five-dimensional characters are far more engaging and intimate as they traverse similar parallel universes.<br />DeLillo is pushing the hidebound limits of commercial fiction in 2003 much the same as Joyce did 80 years ago. For that, he deserves praise. \\"Cosmopolis\\" is nothing if not challenging, thought-provoking and utterly different. One hopes DeLillo wrote it as a comedy, too.<br />But there is simply no single significant character who engages the reader. Every one is emotionally armored, self-absorbed, insane or seemingly incapable of redemption. Packer is promiscuous, greedy, selfish, brusque, dishonest and cold -- and those are his good qualities.<br />On the other hand, if you are among the other 73 readers, besides me, who actually survived Joyce's \\"Ulysses,\\" you will grasp the far deeper contexts and mysteries of \\"Cosmopolis\\" than the poor mope who finds it under \\"Foreign Exchange Markets\\" in the library card file and thinks it's an international money thriller.glish professor described his time with \\"Ulysses\\" this way: \\"It was like having a rib ripped out of my body, being beaten with it, raped with it, and then being forced to eat it.\\" <br />So why regurgitate this book based upon the most familiar story in human history, Homer's Odyssey?

6303202004|5.0|Gene Roddenberry never shied away from commenting on the political and human condition of our little planet.  He deftly combined the elements of science fiction with covert and overt statements about the world situation.  &quot;The Undiscovered Country&quot; is a fine exercise in storytelling, acting, directing, scoring, and technical expertise.<br />Shatner and company go out in a blaze of glory and do themselves proudly.  Although, it's not as thrilling as &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;, this film stands at the top of the list of the ten films in the series.<br />Oh, an earlier reviewer praised the actor playing the &quot;Federation President&quot;.  Well, the actor in question is none other than Kirkwood Smith, the father on &quot;That 70's Show&quot;.<br />The man can ACT!
B00006RIO7|5.0|AHH i love this movie and soudtrack so much! i have seen the movie 4 times so far and almost know all the coreography for &quot;all that jazz&quot; one of my favorite songs in the movie.  i love that scene the best but i love the &quot;cell block tango&quot; almost more! i cant get enough of the soundtrack and movie! im listening to &quot;all that jazz&quot; right now! after this movie catherive zeta-jones is my favorite actress! i was so happy about the awards at the oscars it recieved! best soundtrack ever!
B0000657UB|5.0|I first heard Liege & Lief nearly 20 years ago, when my brother purchased a vinyl copy of the album.  It took me some time before I fully got into Fairport Convention, but I had the best entry point a fan could possibly have--this was the record that has defined the band in the years since its release, with Sandy Denny's beautiful vocals, Richard Thompson's stinging guitar work, and Dave Swarbrick's always-excellent fiddle.<br />Thus, when I spotted the remastered and expanded CD here at Amazon, my first thought was \\"About freakin' time!\\"  It was the only one A&M bothered to keep in print in the States, and the CD remaster from 1988 was only a minor improvement over the original LP.  The original tracks burn as intensely as ever, with greater clarity and width of sound; the bonus tracks are revealing.  \\"Sir Patrick Spens\\" is a bit slower and not quite as good as the final version on Full House, but Sandy does well enough with the vocals, or as well as one vocalist can manage (remember, the final version had Swarb, RT and Simon Nicol all harmonising); \\"Quiet Joys of Brotherhood\\" is rather too slow, however.  I much prefer the version from Sandy's 1972 solo album Sandy, and rather wish that the band's cover of \\"Ballad of Easy Rider,\\" recorded during the L&L sessions, had been included here rather than on the expanded remaster of Unhalfbricking...but there you go.  Fine work nonetheless.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I just returned from the theater where I saw Miyazaki's \\"Spirited Away\\" for the 17th time. It never gets old. I won't bother with a synopsis because most reviews can give you that. I will offer this: I have yet to see a kid in that theater who didn't absolutely love it. Every single one of them, around ages 4-10, never made a sound. No one did (except for the occasional laughter provoked by a midget bird carrying around a fat, purple mouse at its will). The character development and ideas expressed in this film are unrivaled by any other film I have ever seen. Miyazaki uses the character No Face to teach a lesson about the evils of greed, as well as the importance of love and friendship, hard work and perserverance, the necessity to keep our environment clean, and the will to uphold one's integrity and grow when faced with extreme challenges. If you have seen the movie, you can appreciate this: (if not, this won't ruin anything). At one point, Kamaji explains to Haku that only love can break Zeniba's spell. Honestly, and I'm not making this up, as soon as he said that, this little boy sitting behind me turned to his dad and said, \\"I love you dad.\\" This is a powerful movie and is not to be missed. The scenes of vomiting and bleeding, while natural to most organisms, are somewhat graphic at times. I am sick and tired about parents complaining about how it was absolutely terrifying. The MPAA assigns a rating of PG for a reason. It means parental guidance (which means use your own judgement. If the kid gets scared, it's because it's your own freaking fault). There is in fact a difference between PG and G, believe it or not. If you would like to stick with traditional Disney fare, expect superficial and hackneyed plots with shallow character development and no touching moments in which the filmmaker uses his imagination to epitomize human behaviours and get them across to an audience both young and old. This is the most touching and inspiring movie I have ever seen and should not be missed. It is truly a timeless masterpiece.

B00006690G|4.0|I've liked Eminem since the marshall mathers lp, but mostly just because he was [mad] and entertaining and i was [mad]. I didn't see much seriousness in it. This album is much different. Eminem HAS grown as an artist, lyricist, and a beatmaker (dre only did 3 songs here). He is no longer talking (entertaining) [stuff], he has something genuinely interesting and edgy (and sometimes profound) to say. HE is [mad], not trying to [make] the world [mad]. There's a couple of minor snags that ruin the album's overall flow, but regardless it's brilliant.<br />Track-by-track breakdown-<BR>Curtains up: just an intro.<BR>White America: Great song. Over an almost industrial beat, Em raps about the image he's created and how it's benefited him and at the same time made him look like a prankish [person]. In the intro and outro to the song he addresses the hypocrisy of this nation.<BR>Business: Good fun song, great beat (even if it does sound a little too similar to the real slim shady)<BR>Cleanin Out My Closet: Probably the record's most powerful song. This song is everywhere, so we all know what it's about. This is when em's at his best, when he's concentrated on one subject, and the impact of his rage is stunning.<BR>Square Dance: More of em ranting on from topic to topic, but not bad at all. Funny canibus disses scattered throughout and at the end. Also some nice tidbits of political thought (not brilliant but politics are ignored in rap so this must be noted)<BR>The Kiss: a skit with a dark, military beat at the end that segues into<BR>Soldier: Another one of em's darker, angrier songs. About his issues with guns and also his dedication to rap.<BR>Say Goodbye To Hollywood: Smart, sad insight into his legal troubles, but it contradicts the perserverance of \\"soldier\\" by saying that he wants to quit rap. Oh well, tupac contradicted himself too many times to be measured, and he's a legend.<BR>Drips: I hate this song. Obie Trice [is bad] at rhyming and his verse is disgusting. Em'sis better, has some interesting thoughts about promiscuity and std's. doesnt sound fake, but unnecessarily misogynistic.<BR>Without Me: We all know this [darn] song. The only real Slim Shady song, mostly em stays in the real world.<BR>Paul: dumb skit.<BR>Sing For The Moment: Another rock-fueled song (samples aerosmith's dream on) about how em means something to his fans and that he cares about them. also a statement on rap and entertainment in general.<BR>Superman: [bad] southern-rock beat, bad chorus, occasionally hilarious rhymes in the verses but nothing, even his intense hatred for kim justifies \\"put anthrax on a tampax and/slap you till you can't stand\\". He could've addressed his issues with her and other women a lot better.<BR>Hailie's Song: Kinda sweet. Em tries to sing in the verses and chorus and although he ain't great, it's still full of love for his daughter. great rap in the 3rd verse.<BR>Steve Berman: another dumb skit, but funny.<BR>When The Music Stops: D-12 usually spends their time doing dumb hardcore posing, but on this song they all (even bizarre, his verse is hilarious) have a good point to make: rappers need to take responsibility for what they say and do. smart thoughts on the music industry. also a great almost gothic beat.<BR>Say What You Say: Great beats and Jermaine Dupri disses courtesy of dr. dre and em. i hate jermaine dupri.<BR>Til I Collapse: The best song. Spectacularly catchy arena-rock beat, utterly flawless flow brimming with energy and fury, and a good nate dogg hook.<BR>My Dad's Gone Crazy: The last dre beat. Hilarious opening (hailie walking in on em [doing drugs]) and hailie in the chorus is cute. Verses funny at first, then kinda serious at the end. Another standout.<BR>Curtains Close: You think em would resist the opportunity to bring back ken kaniff?
B000000OF6|5.0|As a unit, this collection is superior to either Classic Queen or Greatest Hits in that you get a wider swath of the band's hits. It is also a better buy than the Platinum Collection due to that third disk's dubious worth. <BR>The first disk chronicles the band's rise to the top; culminating in the brash minimalist excercises &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; and &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love.&quot; Disk two shows the band travelling further down that path. Even though they were abandoned by fickle American audiences, <BR>Queen continued to hone its attack with the postmodern cadences of &quot;Radio Ga Ga,&quot; and beautiful ballads like &quot;It's a Hard Life.&quot; Queen rock. Buy this.
0385504209|3.0|I admit my feelings about this book may have been colored by having recently read a far superior, and much more exciting, one that has virtually the same over-view, Daniel Siva's \\"The Confessor\\". While the history and erudition contained within \\"DaVinci\\" cannot help but be fascinating (hence the 3-stars), the book itself is overlong... and for no good reason! Further, it is hampered by an annoying \\"tick\\" that, ultimately, becomes infuriating. Mr. Brown seems to feel that one builds suspense by NEVER revealing anything of importance to the plot without first taking page-upon-page of digression after we have been told that something important IS going to be revealed. While this can be effective when used sparingly, it truly becomes irritating when it is used constantly! One example, which occurs right at the beginning: We are told a murder victim has placed himself in an odd position before dying. We are told this two, three, four, times. Yet we have to go through page after page of description of the Louvre museum (where the body is) before we find out what the position is! And there is no reason for this (it's just the tip of the iceberg) except for Brown to show off his knowledge of history.<br />In short, while I'm sure many will find this tour of ancient culture fascinating (I did myself), as a thriller it fails.

B00007BHOE|5.0|If you live and breathe Slipknot than you need to see this DVD. They did a great job of covering this concert.  From behind the scenes to multiple angles during the concert this is a must buy.
B00005JM1Y|4.0|This was an extra on the \\"Bourne Identity\\" rental DVD.  It may be the best bits but it whetted my appettite to see the rest.   Rowan Atkinson dryly shakes and not stirs Mr. Bean and James Bond and it's a happy marriage.  \\"I can assure you sir, that this is the most secure location in all of England\\" is going to be one of those bar reunion replay scenes, when everyone is doubled over in drunken laughter thinking of the look on Rowan's face.  \\"Airplane\\" meets \\"Goldfinger\\".
B00005JKNF|1.0|I came to this film prepared by the trailer for something on the line of an Agatha Christy mystery. Nothing of the sort happens here. (The trailer HAD to be impactful and forward-moving, even if the movie is not, I realize.) What Gosford IS is Altman taking another tried and true genre, and trying to play it all ironic and sour and dispassionate and the-end-of-narrative-as-we-know-it, ala The Long Goodbye. (Veddy '70s of the old boy, I do declare.)<br />If your interest was piqued by the trailer for Gosford, I can almost guarantee you that this film will disappoint your expectations. If you are the type who like films that take no sides, tell no stories and drift along until they simply cease, then you may like this film. Or you may at least be able to act as if you do. --Which, among circles of people who enjoy talking about film more than watching it, is the entire bailiwick, as it were, no?
6305922756|5.0|After years of waiting, This Is Spinal Tap is finally released on DVD (replacing the deleted Criterion Edition), with all the bells and whistles one expects from this format.  First off, you get the film, remixed with far superior picture and sound quality.  All the sounds, all the smells, are there for you to enjoy.  And as for the film, what is there left to say?  It is a brilliant look at what passed for rock n roll, circa 1984, without being condescending.  This is a film a fan of heavy metal could enjoy equally as much as someone who felt that this was just a passing fad.  <br />The disc is great because you also get a great (albeit short) introduction by Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner, completly in character), as well as great trailers for the film (lookout for the \\"cheese festival\\" bit-it's a hoot).  Also, David St. Hubbins, Nigel Tufnel, and Derek Smalls (Michael McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer, also in character) contribute a wonderful commentary track that is just as funny as the film (it turns out that Spinal Tap HATE the film-it makes them look too stupid).  As if that weren't enough, you also get over an hour of deleted scenes, edited together to give you a completely alternate film.  The only thing missing are the opening/closing credits.  Plus, all the music videos shot for the film, and a very funny TV appearence (from the Joe Franklin Show, who doesn't seem to be in on the joke).  All this on one disc!  A great film, and a great DVD.  Tap into \\"Tap\\"!
0440539811|2.0|Imagine a world in which all the conspiracy theories are true, and you get the very bizarre alternate universe of the Illuminatus! Trilogy.  <br />The book is sometimes very funny, and hits on most of the major conspiracies, letting you know about the \\"death\\" of John Dillinger, the pyramid on the back of the dollar bill, the Kennedy Assassination, the theory of George Washington's imposter, and so forth.  It was written in the 1970s, so it is a bit dated, and its countercultural viewpoint is somewhat out of place today.  <br />It is a very badly structured book -- dozens of characters, hundreds of plot lines, and takes place in many different times and places.  The book also will change from one plot to another, mid page, without any type of break letting you know that the story is changing.  This is done intentionally to create a \\"mosaic\\" in which the various conspiracies and characters can interact, but to a reader it is very maddening.  <br />I love conspiracy theories, but rather than be content with existing organizations and places, the authors throw in a few of their own, each with annoying acronyms; as if to show how clever they can be.  <br />The men who wrote this are obviously very intelligent and well schooled in conspiracy theory, but the book lacks any kind of coherent structure or editorial discipline.  There is a lot of sand and a few pearls.  <br />Should be in the library of any conspiracy buff, but it is not on my list of favorites.  It also cannot hold a candle to Umberto Eco's \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\", which goes over some of the same ground in a much more coherent fashion.
B000063V8U|5.0|The sixth season of this marvelous series in my opinion is the best overall, well rounded season of the entire seven year run.  It is loaded with exceptional, thought provoking and heart warming episodes that resound of exceptional script writing and superb performances by the primary and guest actors.  From the season opener to the closer, few episodes fall out of the \\"superb\\" category!  This season is another marvelous example of Gene Roddenberry's vision.<br /> A brief synopsis of the \\"stand out\\" episodes of this particularly great season:<br />Relics - This superb episode is one of the most treasured episodes of the season as Scotty makes an appearance in the twenty fourth century and is befriended by the crew of the current Enterprise.<br />True Q - This is another great Q episode where John de Lancie makes his first of two sixth season appearances as Q.  Amanda Rogers, a young honor student is aboard the Enterprise and she is beginning to display some \\"Q\\" powers.  <br />Rascals - This is another one of the exceptional episodes of the season where a transporter accident turns Picard, Guinan, Ro Laren and Keiko O'Brien into children.  Not longer after this \\"accident,\\" Ferengi end up in control of the ship.  Picard and the other \\"rascals\\" must find a way to regain control of the Enterprise.<br />A Fistful of Datas - Star Trek meets the old west in a hilarious and quite memorable episode.  Alexander convinces his father to join him on the holodeck in an \\"ancient\\" western.  Unfortunately the holodeck safeties become defective when Data performs an experiment that goes awry and he becomes integrated with the holodeck, putting Worf, Troi and Alexander in danger.<br />Chain of Command, Parts I & II - In this exceptional two part episode Starfleet Command has a new mission for Picard and part of that plan is replacing him with the irascible Captain Edward Jellico in command of the Enterprise.  While Jellico is dealing with the Cardassians, Picard's team sets off on their mission but is captured.  We meet Gul Madred who is played superbly by David Warner.  In some of the most heart wrenching scenes of Trek ever, we're forced to watch as Gul Madred tortures Picard.<br />Ship in a Bottle - In this particularly great episode, the producers bring closure to the second season episode that introduced Professor James Moriarty and his being put in computer memory.<br />Face of the Enemy - This episode is probably one of the best Troi episodes of the entire seven year run.  She awakens and looks in the mirror only to find she looks like a Romulan.  Troi finds that she must act out the role of a Tal Shiar agent and help the Romulan \\"unificationists\\" in order to hopefully get away from the Romulans.<br />Tapestry - In a rare second \\"Q\\" episode in one season, Q returns when Picard is injured and his artificial heart is damage beyond repair.  Q begins to explore the \\"tapestry\\" of Picard's life.  Q takes Picard all the way back to when a Nausicaan ran him through with a sword, causing him to get the artificial heart.  Tapestry in my opinion is probably the best Q/Picard episode of the series.<br />Birthright Parts I & II We are treated to an excellent episode as the Enterprise is docked at Deep Space Nine and Worf is approached by a Yridian named Shrek who wishes to sell him some information about his father.  Worf agrees to purchase the information as long as Shrek takes him to where his father is supposed to be alive.  What followed was one of the best \\"Klingon\\" episodes ever done in Star Trek.<br />Lessons - For the first time in his career, Picard meets a fellow officer under his command who he becomes attracted to.  This is a beautifully well written episode as we see Picard falling in love with Commander Darren and then go through gut wrenching anguish as he fears his orders may have caused her death.<br />The Chase - In another excellent episode, we meet Professor Galen who was one of Picard's professors at the Academy.  He offers Picardthe opportunity of a lifetime for an archaeologist by joining him for an extended period of time.  Unfortunately he must refuse as he cannot leave the Enterprise.  Not long after Professor Galen departs, he is killed and Picard embarks on a mission of the utmost importance to find what Galen was looking for.  They make an astonishing discovery in the end that falls on end.  Of particular note is the \\"humanoid\\" at the end of the show played by Salome Jens whose later performances on DS9 as the leader of the Changelings are spectacular.<br />Rightful Heir - In another one of the most outstanding \\"Klingon\\" episodes, Worf seems to have lost his faith and requests leave to go to Boreth and seek Kahless, his people's mythic spiritual leader.  One can only imagine his surprise as while he's seeking Kahless, Kahless appears before him in flesh and blood.<br />Timescape - This is one of the more intriguing episodes as it begins with Picard, Troi, Data and LaForge returning from a conference in a runabout.  While on approach to the Enterprise's position, they begin to experience some temporal pockets.  They then discover the Enterprise and a Romulan Warbird frozen in the middle of what \\"appears\\" to be a battle.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />Mission Overview:  Year Six<BR>Special Crew Profile:  Lt.

B00006879E|4.0|I just heard this group for the first time tonight, on radio. &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; is one of the best songs I've heard from any new group in years. I called the radio station to find out group name, logged on to find them, and waa laa. I sampled the other CD songs at CDNow.com, loved Shiver &amp; She Will Be Loved almost as much as Harder. Please tell me, is this the ONLY CD they have so far? Do they have their own website? And...why are they opening for acts, instead of headlining their own shows??? This group has it ALL (No TV-created, or boy band here!). The other reviews gave you the details, this review is all about the visceral (sp?), emotional, found-a-new-group-to-love joy of discovering Maroon 5! Just maybe, if we all call every request line across the nation &amp; get the rest of this CD on the air, we/I will get to hear a LOT more of them? :-)  Awesome is an understatement...WARNING: You can't listen to just one song without wanting to hear them all, again &amp; again &amp; again.<br />Maroon 5 is opening for Matchbox 20 at Albany, NY Pepsi Arena on May 13, 2003, for a one-night-stand performance. I wonder how many will be there JUST for the so-called opening band, Maroon 5, and leave before the so-called &quot;main event&quot;? Me!<br />I welcome email feedback to my questions.<br />Gina
B00000272N|5.0|This is one of the greatest debuts ever(if not the best). Alice In Chains is the best band of all time, I don't care what you say. Now, I will go over the songs:<br />1. We Die Young-10/10-The very first song is oh so crucial on a record, and this one does not disappoint.<BR>2. Man In The Box-15/10-It is that good. In my opinion, this is their best song. (check out the solo)<BR>3. Sea Of Sorrow-10/10-Good song with some interesting lyrics. Check it out.<BR>4. Bleed The Freak-10/10-My second favorite track, this song cannot be played enough.<BR>5. I Can't Remember-10/10-Do you notice a pattern in the song ratings?<BR>6. Love, Hate, Love-8/10-Not a big fan of this one, it just drags on too long for my taste (but not as long as it is on their Live album).<BR>7. It Ain't Like That-10/10-Good guitar, good lyrics (sounds like just about every other Alice song, huh?)<BR>8. Sunshine-10/10-Great song that I cannot, once again, get tired of.<BR>9. Put You Down-10/10-GREAT BASS IN THIS ONE!<BR>10. Confusion-8/10-My least favorite on here.<BR>11. I Know Somethin' ('Bout You)-10/10-Sounds close to being punk or something. Still a good song.<BR>12. Real Thing-10/10-Yay! a song about cocaine! how could it be any better than that?<br />All in all, buy this album and you will not be disappointed. If you can deal with tapes, it only costs $5.<br />ENJOY AND LONG LIVE ALICE IN CHAINS!
0060512806|5.0|Cryptonomicon is a fascinating and fantastic work. As most of the reviewers here have pointed out, the novel has a richness that is both a treat and a challenge to the reader. Even the passages (some pretty long!) that pertain to technical issues are generally readable (you don't have to get *all* the details to catch the significant plot points). Stephenson interweaves the episodes from the two timelines (WW II and contemporary) until the reader sees more and more connections.<br />I understand why some reviewers did not like the ending. Without committing the reviewer's cardinal sin of giving away major plot points (please, people, these reviews are mostly read by folks trying to decide whether to read the book; don't spoil the fun for them!), I'd say Stephenson's resolution of the plot(s) is just about right. It would have been a bit too pat and artificial for each loose end to be tied up in a neat little bow and \\"they all lived happily ever after\\". Yes, he doesn't tell us everything about the mysterious Enoch Root (and I definitely wanted to know more). Did the renegade U-boat captain cheat death? Readers can disagree because the author does not explicitly tell us. However, we get to the end of the race to Golgotha and we know who outwitted whom in the final crunch. If Stephenson chooses to write a separate novel on whether the protagonists are ultimately successful with their digital money/data haven/communications venture/business/scheme, I will want to read it, but Cryptonomicon reached a major resolution point, a moment at which the surviving characters of the contemporary plot line must now decide what to do next.<br />When compared to the strengths of this novel, the weaknesses are insignificant -- and sometimes unavoidable. Amy Shaftoe is the only major female character we get to know more than slightly. However, the WW II plot line occurs in the ranks of the military, the huts of the codebreakers, and aboard ships and U-boats; women were absent or relegated to subsidiary roles in these environments. The contemporary plot line offered Stephenson more opportunity for interesting female players, but their actual presence in the ranks of nerds, geeks, and hackers is similarly limited. If the author had gone out of his way to \\"fix\\" this problem, the novel would have had even greater anachronisms than the occasional distraction of WW II participants talking like people from the 1990s.<br />Bottom line: An excellent, entertaining, enormous novel that will almost certainly reward a second reading. How rare is that?
B000000H57|5.0|Type O Negative has finally hit the mark. October Rust is by far the climax of their musical careers. Their previous albums lead up to this masterpiece. After listening to October Rust Type O Negative became my favourite band. October Rust has a nature/love/death theme with melodic guitar riffs and solos. Peter Steele's voice has taken shape with the rest of the band. This album is great to listen to on a rainy summer day, an evening drive, and especially on a fall afternoon. I would recommend this cd to anyone. At first it may not catch your interest, but keep listening to it, I can almost guarentee it will grow on you.
B00008AY3L|4.0|This is a great disc. Harper draws from a wide variety of influences, from the roots reggae sounding &quot;With My Own Two Hands&quot; to the Stevie Wonder-ish &quot;Brown-eyed Blues&quot; to a Cat Stevens sounding &quot;She's Only Happy In The Sun&quot;. A very eclectic disc, with some truly beautiful tones.<BR> This CD fits in perfectly with Harper's previous discs, including the great Fight For Your Mind.
B00005JLWN|5.0|The Matrix was a great film, but in many respects it has come to represent to modern viewers all that is modern and innovative in the realm of fight cinematography. What was in actuality the logical culmination of years of HK cinema coupled with the power of the computer age of film-making has become an figurehead of innovation to the narrow-minded movie-going public. While the Matrix will always be one of my favorite movies, in this respect it has prevented films which also take the same logical step from gaining any widespread support.<br />Equilibrium is one such film that has suffered under The Matrix's shadow. This film, because of its use of martial arts inspired, CG-aided gunplay has been cast aside by most critics as a Matrix clone. This label does this film a great disservice. <br />As if wrenched straight from the pages of 1984, A Brave New World, and Fahrenheit 451, the story of Equilibrium is pure, unapologetic science fiction. While the plot is obviously somewhat derivitve in premise, the cast grants the film a great deal of legitimacy with their performances. Particularly of note are the performances of Christian Bale (American Psycho, Reign of Fire), and Angus McFadyen (Braveheart, Titus). Bale's captivating transition from the haunting detachment of his drug induced complacency to the passionate recognition of the true value of feeling is brilliant, and perfectly brings to the fore the message of the film.<br />The fight sequences of the film are nothing short of amazing. In start contrast to the drawn out encounters of The Matrix, the fights scenes in Equilibrium seem as if they last only a few seconds. However, Wimmer managed to pack some of the most explosive fighting seen in a film into those few seconds. The on-screen explanation of the martial arts form employed by the clerics, called Gun-Kata, was a nice added touch. It allows viewers to suspend their disbelief much more easily when witnessing a single man dispatch a room full of foes.<br />The Bottom Line: A great movie. Its one of those films that you feel special for seeing and enjoying just because you know everyone else missed out on it. Solid acting on all fronts and great fight scenes come together to make the best movie nobody saw.
B000089A07|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It is a different role for Ralph Fiennes to play a madman and I thought he did a wonderful job.  The way they made this movie was excellent.  There wasn't very many gory scenes and it actually had a story line to follow and understand.  I would recommend this to the faint of heart.
B000002IWQ|5.0|I have most of the back catalogue, but Counterparts, for me, is where everything comes together: a decent album length (eleven songs), great song structures and a fantastic sound and mix (Animate just blows me away each time).  A few people before have criticised the lyrics and I just cannot understand where they are coming form- Counterpart's lyrics range from the cerebral and metaphysical (how do you use the word phosphorus in a song?) to the &quot;cliched&quot;, and I think that this is the album's strength.  I know Rush can come across to some people as cold and too technical, but when I hear songs like Nobody's Hero and Everyday Glory, the words might be commercial but the impact and sincerity is not.  And Neil Peart's drumming is on top form here; check out his use of the ride cymbal.  Counterparts was the last Rush album to sue a Ludwig kit, and the sound markedly changes (to me, for the worse)for T4E and VT.  The best since Moving Pictures: maybe.  My personal fav, definitely
B0000041Q3|5.0|The first Turandot CD I bought was Eva Turner's live (but mono)recording in the 30's. Hers was one tremendous voice. Next I heard the Nilsson/Corelli partnership and at that time it was my first choice. When I heard this Sutherland/Pavarotti recording at first (after hearing Nilsson's) I thought this will never do. Over the years of listening to others (Nilsson/Bjoerling, Marton/Carreras live, etc.) and this again I've realized that for me this one is the best overall. Sure Sutherland's voice is no Nilsson's and she never sang this role on stage but her performance here is cleaner, pitch-perfect and more believable. The high C's are secure and big enough to soar over the massive chorus and orchestra (reminds me of that Wagnerian-sized high E-flat that caps the Mad Scene on her first Lucia recording). I wasn't a Sutherland fan but this helped me become one. Pavarotti sings gloriously and proves he's really one of the best tenors ever. Caballe's singing of Liu will make you cry and what else can I say of her perfect pianissimos. If you can afford to buy as many recordings as you can, buy all of them for each recording has treasures waiting to be enjoyed. If you're new to opera and can only afford one, get this recording. It's worth every penny.
0316921173|5.0|I spent much of last summer reading David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest. In spite of its backbreaking length, the novel is surprisingly manageable. Foster Wallace tells the stories of several outrageous characters, all sharing a common drug addiction. He spins an absurd tale of hypersmart children, toblerone-fiending Arab sheiks, and even conspiring North American secessionists, but through it all, his dictum remains unperverted. Infinite Jest is an awe-inspiring cacophony of wit and creativity. In fact, it has forced the creation of an entirely new genre. Foster Wallace blends elements of Pynchon and Heller, and then adds his own humorous touch. Authors such as Mark Leyner now follow Infinite Jest's lead: in particular, a highly stylized satire and the introduction of a chic class of intellectual youth. Infinite Jest is a solid reassurance that today's writers can rival the best of the literary masters.
B000002IP1|5.0|This album is be far the best Collins record that I have. I have all of his albums and this one is by far the best one of his career. The sunny pop of &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; is gone and in it's place is a more complex yet accessible style that still holds strong over the years. &quot;Another Day In Paradise&quot; remains my favorite Collins' track to this very day. &quot;Both Sides&quot; was a great yet underrated follow-up to this album but &quot;Dance Into The Light&quot; was a dissapointment. It wouldn't be until &quot;Testify&quot; that I feel that the REAL Phil came back. Anyhow, &quot;But Seriously&quot; is truly a must-have album for anyone who likes truly rewarding pop music. Phil Collins is one of the best singers on the planet!
B00006F7S4|5.0|Another brilliant album. Hints of Gordon Lightfoot? Beck does likes the oldies.
B000002ITG|5.0|I saw Zeppelin back in 1970.  By the mid 70's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" was a staple of midnight rock radio, and already acquiring the varnish of an FM \\"classic.\\"  But by then I had already lost touch with their album output.  Now, thirty years later I've got my hands on this remastered set.  Given that I used to listen to them on an 8 track player in my car, this is a revelation.  I had to wait a long time to hear Zep on a decent stereo system, but better late than never.<br /><br />That Zeppelin was a blues based band was always overshadowed by their popular acclaim as a \\"heavy metal\\" band.  This set sets the record straight.  They kicked [...] as a rockin' blues band.  Period.
B000059QY2|4.0|This is a dynamic and exciting show with the leads at the top of their game.<br />  Rigoletto has never been more convincingly acted than in the hands of Ingvar Wixell.  His voice is powerful and fulll of different colors to enjoy throuought the opera.  His g# at the end of the 2nd act is extremely impressive.  He radiates internal struggle and pain and earns his stars as not only a great baritone but a great actor.<br />  Gilda gets a wonderful treatment by Gruderova, who can sing a pianissimo as well as you can hear.  Her joy and pain is clearly visible throughout and she really does portray well the confused, miserable creature that Gilda becomes quite well.  unlike pavarotti, she takes very few liberties from the score and sings within it well.<br />  Pavarotti sounds great.  This is the kind of role that is made for his voice.  His duke is beautifully sounded in his mature but lyric voice. This is the kind of spinto singing that makes pavarotti one of the greatest tenors of all time. His acting, while entertaining, is unconvincing.  He has a disturbing habit of never blinking his eyes during Aria's which can bug the viewer.<br />  Overall this is a absolutley fabulous entertainment experience.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is the lip synching.  I think it takes away from the opera experience to have it recorded and dubbed into the scene.  The singers expression and the excitement of the opera is increased when it is live.  I think, however, it is a worthwhile buy for opera and non-opera fans alike. The story and presentation is wonderful and the singing doubly so.
1400034779|2.0|In consideration of the book's title I must admit that I was somewhat suprised and excited when reading the first few chapters because there was a glimpse of the culture of Mme Ramotswe's Africa.  We learned about customs and acceptable and unacceptable social practices and those items that are &quot;taboo.&quot;  Unfortunately, as the author continues with Mme Ramotswe's journey as a detective I found that the author could have indulged us more with an exploration into the &quot;whys&quot; rather than teasing us with shallow information.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I think this cd is better than Hybrid Theory. Every song is equally good..I can listen through the whole thing. I think Linkin Park are the Kings of Rock now. I can't really pick my favorite songs because all of them are good. I'd even say Meteora is in the top 10 cds of all time. Just get it and you'll see what I'm talking about. 5/5
0060523794|4.0|This book is very easy to read and keeps the reader's attention throughout.  I felt that the author got into just enough detail to make his points without dragging down the pace of the book.  Being able to see inside the \\"IBM machine\\" to understand how it functioned and how it changed was very fascinating to me.  Getting thousands of people to change the way they think about their jobs, about IBM's business, and about the culture of the company just seems like an incredibly daunting task, yet he walks the reader through just how he did it, while reminding us all that it's only impossible if you believe it is impossible (an excellent life lesson).<br /> While reading the book I found myself asking if I would have made the same decisions that Gerstner did.  In many cases the answer was yes (Monday morning quarterbacking is great isn't it?), but there were many decisions that he had to make that took a lot of guts, and in some cases they were the wrong decisions.  He freely admits that not all of his ideas worked, but it was better to try, fail, learn and move on, than never to try at all.<br /> Throughout the book Gerstner gives credit to many people that were instrumental in the turnaround.  I respect a person who doesn't assume all of the glory.  I can see why he was able to get thousands of people to believe in and follow his ideas.  He comes across as a very charismatic individual.  Easily one of the top ten people you would love to meet at a party.<br /> In the appendix of the book the author includes copies of employee communications so that the reader can gain a better understanding of the situation at the time.  Some of these are letters to employees; some are announcements, while others are e-mails to Gerstner himself from employees.  I found this to be an excellent addition to the book, providing additional insight into his and IBM's world.<br />Conclusion<BR> This was a very good book and highly recommended for anyone in management.  I believe it to be an excellent case study in what happens when companies become complacent, and an equally valuable case study in how to turn a company around.  I believe it has some very instructive advice while at the same time reminding the reader that every situation is different, and that sometimes you have to go with your gut feel.<br /> This book gives the reader the unique opportunity to get inside the mind of one of the great, and highly successful businessmen of our time, during a time when he was attempting to tackle perhaps his greatest life challenge.  I found the book very informative and insightful, and will most likely find myself reading it again.<br />Rating<BR> I gave this book a rating of four stars out of five.  While I found the content fascinating, the author's style could have been better.  I found some sections to be a little too brief and needing a bit more elaboration.  The flow could have been a bit smoother also.  All in all, I would still definitely recommend this book.
B000066NW0|5.0|I love the cd since the moment I first heard it. After listen Complicated like a million times. I was just so blown away that I decided to purchase it. And it was totally worth it. As a 17 year old girl I can relate to each of the song of this album. If you've been into brokeups, rejection, moving out, being in love, and all that stuff, you gotta love it. My favorite ones are those who have a lotta guitar and drums like Losing Grip, sk8er boi and Unwanted. Rock on!!!!
B00008977N|5.0|If you've never experienced a Peter Gabriel concert, this is the next best thing. The audio on this disc is great! Perfect for showing off a high end home theater. Peter Gabriel shows you some of the feeling and imagery that goes into his music and it's very entertaining. Paula Cole sings back up vocals, Tony Levin (of course) is on the bass, David Rhodes on guitar, the whole crew. Of course the music is amazing, GO PETE!

B00004Z459|5.0|I have owned this CD from October 24th 2000 (Day 1) and I have to say i love EVERY SONG!!! there is not one bad song on the CD!! If you are thinking about starting to lissen to a new band i would tell you choose Linkin Park. Hybid Theroy is KILLER!!!!<BR>100/10 in my book.
B000084T18|5.0|This is a great CD, a classic, but the media hype around him is just too high. In my opinion 'Pac is the greatest rapper of all time and I really liked the recent collaboration with him and 50 on Whoo Kid's upcoming album. Also, his collabo with Biggie was great too and the remix with Em was great. He had all the street credit he needed before he released this album. No wonder why he sold 872,000 copies in only 3 days. It's great to see that finally people like Em and 50 are selling this much and not Nelly and Ja Rule whose whole albums are about women. In my opinion it's ridiculous, I never thought that 50 would blow up this big. I know that now they're all burning knowing that 50 didn't talk about the things they did, but he still managed to sell ten times more than them. My rating on this album including the bonus tracks are as follows:<BR>4.5/5 What up gangsta-Great song, but a little short, needed one more verse<BR>5/5-Produced by Eminem, incredible song, Em is ripping so is 50<br />5/5-One of my favorites, co-produced by Em, the flow is remarkable and the lyrics are killin' it, favorite line, \\"In the bible it says what goes around comes around...\\"<BR>5/5-In Da Club-A little short, but the flow and the beats are crazy. Dre wrote the beats if you didn't know<BR>5/5-High All The Time-Great beats co-produced by Em, fav line \\"If David can go against Goliath for the stone, I can go at Nas and Jigga both for the throne\\"<BR>5/5-Heat-Dre does a great job with the beats and he just does his job like usually<BR>5/5-If I Can't-Dre once again does a great job and his flow is incredible<BR>4.5/5-Blood Hound-The flow is incredible and Young Buck was good too, but the beats I think are the weakest on the album<BR>5/5-Back Down-Great beats by Dre, the entire song is a diss to Ja Rule and I'm glad that there is finally someone that is out here tryin' to put that boy away cuz I think him and Nelly are a disgrace to rap<BR>5/5-P.I.M.P.-Funny, unusual beat, but once again great flow, check out the remix with Snoop on Whoo Kid's upcoming album<BR>5/5-Like My Style-Beats by Rockwilder, flow is great, Yayo does a great job with closing out the song<BR>5/5-Poor Lil Rich-Co-produced by Em, it's a complete all around song<BR>4.5/5-It was a good song but I just thought that this CD shouldnt've included any songs about love but it was still coo<BR>5/5-Don't Push Me-Produced by Em, my favorite verse is Lloyd Bank's (G-Unit) verse, cause he's just rippin' 'it<BR>5/5-Gotta Make It To Heaven-Great subject<BR>*5/5-Wanksta-I shouldn't say more<BR>*5/5-U Not Like Me-Another one of my favorites, co-produced by Em, at first I didn't feel this song, but now i'm totally feelin' it. Favorite Line, \\"Mamma says everything happened to us was part of God's plan, so at night when I talk to him, I got my gun in my hand...\\" and it's crazy what he says after that<BR>*5/5-Life's on the line-Heard this song way before the album came out, and it's funny \\"it's murda I don't believe you\\" so dont I.
B00008H2LB|5.0|The first time that I listened to this album, I did not really like it, however, after listening to it a few times, I have to say that this album is really great.  In an era where music has begun to loose it's touch, Linkin Park is an exception.  At times this album is harder, and in one case I found it to be more urban than Hybrid Theory.  Sometimes it is softer, and more meaningful than Hybrid Theory.  It is this blend, and this variety that makes it such a great album though.  The songs are well written, have good music, and excellent vocals, which are a few things that most albums no longer offer.  Linkin Park is one of the few truly great bands of recent years, and that is why their last album sold as well as it did.  If I had to pick which was their better album, I couldn't.  It is every bit as great and interesting as their first.  Chester Bennington himself is an extreme talent.  Just as a suggestion, I think that him and Slash (the guitarist of Guns and Roses) should get together sometime and do a song.  I think that they could come up with something really amazing.  Anayways, to sum it all up, Meteora is a great album, and definitely worth buying.  It just gets better and better every time I listen to it.  In the end (pun not intended), quality wins over quantity every time.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I don't know how much better this movie could of been.
B000005HNQ|5.0|OK, first off, I'm a metal head.  I play shred guitar, and usually listen to fairly heavy and fast stuff.  That being said, I have owned this album since its release, and have NOT STOPPED LISTENING TO IT!  One of the most beautiful recordings I have ever heard.  Get it, you will NOT regret it.  &quot;I'd rather soar.....&quot;

B00003CXHJ|1.0|U-571 movie is an complete and utter insult to the British who fought and died in WW2. The historical innacuracies are everywhere. A big one is that the Brits captured the Enigma decoder machine, not the Americans (we weren't even in the war yet!). Why does Hollywood sometimes feel the need to rewrite history? I find it funny how most Americans give this movie high ratings, but most people outside the US rate it low. Are we (US) that stupid? Maybe Americans just don't give a hoot about how history is portrayed in movies as long as we are the clean-cut heroes who win in the end and take credit for everything. People say that this is only fiction and harmless. But I say that it is based on specific historical facts- which got totally twisted and distorted. Hollywood can make great historically accurate war movies when they really want to. This movie is total embarrasment and I appologize to all of the Brits for this insulting, inaccurate, [weak] movie. If this movie and the new Pearle Harbor are the sign of things to come, I think we are in trouble. Buy Das Boot. One of the best and historically accurate war movies ever made.
0671027344|4.0|One great book, which illustrated the hard ships of growing through the eyes of a teenager. Humorist and serious at different sections within the story. I really enjoyed how the book was written because it was more personal, written in journal form. This book will help other teens and maybe even some parents to understand their gaps a little better. I highly recommend this book to teens and parents. I thought this story was going to be boring because all it mainly talks about is the life and the struggles of different situations that one faces in growing up being different, unaccetped, drug, and understanding ones self.
0767814037|1.0|this movie, as a western, is worse than a john wayne b movie from the 30's.<br />other reviewers state that the 'kasden brothers were paying homage to the traditional western genre'. no, no they weren't. they were completely lost, and should be forgiven, or forgotten.<br />i can easily see that this movie is on a par with ed wood's movies.<br />watching these reknowned actors (actresses) in this terrible movie begs the question: do any of them feel that this was a good movie still? or do they run for cover whenever this movie is mentioned?<br />this movie is worth watching because it is so very bad.<br />alvin
B000089RVX|5.0|I agree with one of my fellow critics: these guys have every indication of going right to the top. This album may very well be the doorway into a heavier Christian sound, which until now has been the domain of an almost exclusively folk/country/acoustic format. Amy Lee's vocals are reminiscent of Portishead, but with an intensity unavailable from that group. Her range is startling: Motown and gospel twists can pop up at any minute. This group seems to wear their influences on their sleeves: one can easily hear Linkin Park in the guitars and the back-and-forth vocals of \\"Bring Me to Life,\\" but in the song \\"Haunted\\" there is definitely some old White Zombie, circa \\"La Sexorcisto,\\" mixed in. The use of male-female vocals in such a raw way is refreshing, and their careful use of techno, strings and power grooves is impressive.  However, I do not agree with another critic, who upbraided the vocals content-wise: they are not necessarily Gothic; they are the penitence of a Christian soul in reflection on her life. The song arrangement is narratively progressive, moving from the self-as-God of \\"Going Under\\" to the divine realization of \\"Tourniquet\\" (a little exposure, and this one will be a hit) and at last to the Gregorianish chant coda in \\"Whisper.\\"  This album has a story if one has the ears to hear it, and the arrangement reflects the group's ultimate goal: to win souls to Christ through their music. It is the attractive package of heavy guitars, solid grooves and entrancing vocal range, however, that will make their message very easy to mainstream.
B00008DDXC|5.0|Film makers have always had one thing in mind, make a great movie. I think that Chris Columbus has accomplished this and has brought the dazzling world of Harry Potter to life. When I saw the Sorcerer's Stone, I admit I was impressed, but when I saw the Chamber of Secrets I had to see it three times and I still couldn't get enough! Columbus, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and the rest of the cast really outdid themselves this time! Although we are all devastated by the death of Richard Harris (Albus Dumbledore) his legacy will live on. I give this wondrous film 5 stars and 2 thumbs up! I hope that The Prisoner of Azkaban will prove that even perfection can be perfected. I can't wait to see this dazzling cast's work once again on the big, silver screen...especially, Daniel Radcliffe as Harry!!!
B00008DDSC|3.0|Starts out slow then get funny then goes slow again. The acting is great by both Gylenhaal and Spader. Maggie's facial expressions are great. Would it prefered it to be more funny.
0312305060|5.0|The hours was a very interesting read, as it takes you back and forward, fiction and non fiction. it's realy a one of kind book. the characters are finely expressed. it's amazing how can one day tell as all what we need to know about a person. Read it it's worth it, the movie is good too.

B00005B3Z6|5.0|Every viewer of the American Queer As Folk has probably wondered how the British version holds up.  Since it's not likely that it will be played on American TV any time soon, this is probably the only way to tell.<BR>You'll definitely see the parallels between the two series, but after a couple of episodes, this ends quickly and you'll tend to fall in love with these characters equally.  <BR>It's impossible for me to tell which one I like more.  You'll have to decide that for yourself.
B00005JLSC|5.0|It's true the story is dark, both sentimental and cynical, a film you wouldn't expect to have fun with.  And the story is certainly not inspiring.  But the dancing, the music, the sets and lighting, all make it a WOW movie to watch.<br />Catherine Zeta-Jones definitely steals the show in the musical performance department.  She is absolutely scintillating -- vivacious, energetic, all-out, sexy and strong.  But Renee and Richard also hold up their own quite nicely.  Who would have thought?!  I don't understand how anyone could NOT like Richard Gere's tap dance -- it was so well-placed in the script, was such  an apt allegory for the \\"fancy footwork\\" needed to get out of court room trouble, and it looked effortless.  Bravo for all three performers!<br />Queen Latifah actually stole the show for most complex character development, however.  She was subtle; you could never quite get a fix on her.  Was she a good guy, or a bad guy?  It was so blindingly obvious with all the other characters.  While it must be acknowledged that the character was written that way, Queen Latifah pulled it off, without any glimpse of discontinuity in the character.  And her musical number was as scintillating as Catherine's were.  Too bad there weren't more of them.<br />I twitched through the whole film, wanting to dance along with the numbers.  And stayed right through to the end of the credits in order to determine who danced and sang for Renee and Richard.  I strongly recommend this film for any who like good musicals.  This will be a classic!
0316666343|3.0|It was a nice read, not totally unworthy. it's an interesting prespective. the most interesting thing is how the family recovers, they all had their own way. read it if you want.
0393312836|5.0|I have to admit, I was actually afraid to read this book.  I have never seen the movie but had heard many awful things about it.  I was expecting a book without a purpose (as many described the movie to me) that graphically described countless horrific crimes and then ended.  I knew it couldn't be as bad as people described and still be so popular so I decided I would read it for myself.  I am happy to report that this book is nothing like what I expected.  <br />     The slang language used by the main characters of this novel serves two purposes to me.  First, it transports the reader directly to Burgess' futuristic world that quickly becomes frighteningly real while at the same time provides a sort of buffer that allows the reader, for some unknown reason, to still like Alex despite his tendencies toward terrible, violent crimes.  It is for this same unknown reason that I found myself appalled at the \\"cure\\" Alex was given in order to be released from prison.<br />     This novel poses several very intriguing questions.  I found the prison chaplain's view especially interesting.  \\"It may be horrible to be good.\\"  Is it better to choose to be bad or to be forced to be good?  Being good, or in this case, not doing bad things, doesn't make a person good when their inner thoughts are still bad.  The closest Alex gets to being good is not when he is physically kept from committing violent crimes but when he realizes, through his own reasoning, that there is more to life than violence and crime.<br />     There is much more to this book than graphic violence and crime, or even what I have briefly mentioned here.  The language of this book makes it one of a kind and the thought provoking questions it raises make it definitely worth reading.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|If you've seen the movie, you've probably fallen in love with the music and the unusual way to add snippets of different songs together for a definitely unique song.  The stand-outs for this CD are &quot;The Elephant Melody,&quot; &quot;Come What May,&quot; and Ewan McGregor belting out &quot;Your Song.&quot;  Such powerful and unexpected singers.  Who knew he and Nicole Kidman could sing?<BR>The only problem is that some of the popular songs in the movie did not fit on this CD.  Gone is the funny &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and the surprise &quot;The Show Must Go On.&quot;  The producers realized these omissions and then turned out Moulin Rouge 2.  If you can get past the missing songs, you'll the CD as much as I do.
6301543408|4.0|Most people, including Trekkies, despise this movie. Recently I decided to rewatch it, remembering that I had liked it in the past. This a damned fine movie, stumbling only somewhat in the conclusion. That doesn't make it a bad or frustrating movie, however. Its few flaws make the summation of this adventure to be strangely fascinating. It is sometimes silly, and has the occasional weak scene, but there are some scenes that are among the best and most poignant/breathtaking in the Star Trek cannon.<BR>I particularly liked Bones' and Spock's scene with their fathers and Kirk's ascent up the mountain (the music making the latter scene really special).
B000078DOI|4.0|the old funk of chili peppers untill these rereleases i was unable to find, and i thank EMI for rerealeases. these are fun to listen to, i recommend Magic Johnson and Punk Rock Classic and Pritty Little Ditty.

B000028U0Y|5.0|If you don't have this gem by Johnny Cash then you MUST IMMEDIATELY purchase it NOW! DO NOT DELAY! I will not explain the tracks in detail because words can't describe the greatness, power and honesty that this album contains. Or you could buy something from one of the new \\"country\\" artists that are all over the radio. But if you do that you are only living a lie because this Johnny Cash album makes any of that new [music] look like a JOKE.
B00006J3WH|4.0|If you liked the episode you will like the soundtrack. Of course it has a different feel to it but it's one thing to watch it and another just to hear it. It does have some slow points but it's a nice touch to add to a Buffy collection.
B00000J7JO|5.0|this is one of the few cds ive EVER heard in my life that if i hear a song off it i have to listen to the cd at least twice before im satisfied. its quite possibly one of my favorite cds if you couldnt tell, and need i say more than its a classic? only downside is porcelian, but, thats only depending what mood im in. ive never actually heard a song where the drummer just uses brushes.
B0000797IO|4.0|Having read several reviews of this movie before renting it, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Some people seem to think it's a comedy, others think it's a \\"dark\\" comedy, and others claim it's a bleak drama. The truth is, it's not a movie that comes with a built-in genre indicator, which may be why some reviewers found it so frustrating. Certainly, if one was hoping for a light-hearted comedy, this movie would be a big disappointment. Jennifer Aniston plays a young woman stuck in a dead-end retailing job in a dead-end town in a dead-end life...her husband is a well-meaning schmuck and throughout the film she wears this look on her face like life has already passed her by. When a dark and brooding new co-worker exchanges meaningful looks with her, an ill-fated romance begins that is clearly more about her needing to find an escape from her life than any actual connection between the two of them. Things quickly become complicated.  Not in a wacky comedy kind of way, but more in a real-life kind of way. People at work are noticing them spending too much time together. Her husband's best friend catches on and uses the information to blackmail her. Soon, Jennifer Aniston is stuck in a situation that has no \\"right\\" answers. Ultimately, \\"The Good Girl\\" is a morally ambiguous film that challenges the viewer to form her/his own opinion about the lead character's choices.  Are moral compromises inevitable? Is it fair to put one's own happiness before one's responsibilities? Is romantic self-destruction really all that romantic, or is it just a way to distract oneself from the daily grind? A very satisfying movie with no easy answers, \\"The Good Girl\\" has none of the gloss and glitter of a Hollywood film. It is an observant and thoughtful film, well acted, and very much worth your time.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This album is the best Linkin Park album to date. Far better than Hybrid Theory. This band has truly come a long way since their 2000 debut. Every song just has nice beats and great guitar riffs. I bought this album expecting something great but instead i got something way better than great. It's AWESOME.<BR>With some great tracks like &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; and &quot;Faint&quot; this album will most likely be and IS THE BEST of 2003. It has something for everybody, with Chester's hard rock voice and Mike's hip-hop style it's the greatest combo ever. That's not mentioning Mr.Hahn's sampling and beats but also Brad's great guitar riffs. You like rap? You like Hard Rock? Then go buy this Damn album. AND BUY EVERY OTHER LINKIN PARK CD THAT'S OUT AND THAT COMES OUT IN THE FUTURE.
B00005JLKN|5.0|The key thing about watching &quot;Red Dragon&quot; is to realize that this is not a Hannibal Lecter story.  The character was a compelling but relatively minor figure in both the Thomas Harris novel and &quot;Manhunter,&quot; the original cinematic adaptation by Michael Mann.  Obviously screenwriter Ted Tally and director Brett Ratner have enhanced the role for this 2002 film, but Anthony Hopkins's part is not a central part of the story.  Once you understand that you will discover that &quot;Red Dragon&quot; exceeds your expectations.  But if you cannot get around this idea then you are probably going to be bitterly disappointed with this film.<br />Clearly a major strength of this film is the stellar caste, which in addition to Hopkins has Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, Harvey Keitel, Emily Watson, Mary-Louise Parker, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Anthony Heald, and Mary Beth Hurt (add to the list Ellen Burstyn as the voice of Grandma Dolarhyde).  But what makes this film work is its intelligence, for which Harris and Tally get the credit.  Will Graham is an intelligent man, an F.B.I. profiler who constantly shows throughout this story that he has a gift for saying the right thing, whether he is talking to Lecter, a room full of police officers, the head of a company, or the Red Dragon himself.  Yes, he has been scarred psychologically as well as physically by his capture of Lecter, but it is not an incapacitating condition as was the case with Clarice Starling.  In \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" the climax of the film involved a cinematic commonplace that has always enraged me, when a law enforcement officer has a gun drawn and aimed at a suspect who then manages to get away.  I thought the climax of \\"The Red Dragon\\" involved an exhilarating series of intelligent, brilliant moves by the good guys.<br />The other aspect of this story that makes it compelling is that the villain is a monster with a soul.  The idea of a serial killer falling in love, struggling to thwart the demonic voices and try to stop his descent into hell is brilliant.  The circle becomes complete when you notice that all of the main characters in this film are complex; granted, not as complex as the Red Dragon, but enough that the actors reading this script would be drawn to the parts.  But the ability of the villain to be surprising is critical because usually in the final analysis it is the villain that makes the film.  Again, this underscores the fact that Lecter is not the villain of the piece.  But he was in \\"Hannibal,\\" and look how well that film was received.  Here we are back to the pivotal idea that even when this character is bound and gagged in a cell he is still capable of killing you.<br />Ultimately Hannibal Lecter remains the problematic element in the film; more often that not his scenes are suggestive if not outright reminiscent of scenes from \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\"  One of the obvious questions that springs to mind is whether Hopkins's Lecter would have made as big of an impact if \\"Red Dragon\\" had indeed been the first of the reconstituted trilogy.  Ultimately the answer has to be \\"no,\\" but because this is clearly a prequel made fully cognizant of the film that comes after it.  To appreciate how difficult this is to pull off look at other recent prequels such as \\"Gods and Generals\\" and either of the two Star Wars films.  The argument here is not that \\"The Red Dragon\\" is a better film than \\"The Silence of the Lambs,\\" but that it is a worthy successor to that classic film, even if it takes place first.<br />Final Note:  The commentary track with Ratner and Tally is well worth a second viewing of the film, more so in terms of tidbits about the production than analytical insights into the adaptation.  The rest of the DVD extras are at least average, but the commentary is the big attraction here.monic voices and try to stop his descent into hell is brilliant.

B000003TA4|5.0|first off i love the sound of the jaguar (&quot;jazz&quot; guitar that fender makes) that kobain used. secondly, i agree with many people that this is a very influencial cd, with alot of good music on it. which cant be said of many cds out there which have 3 or 4 good songs and 13 tracks. the only other thing i can say is its one of my favorites.
B000002J2B|5.0|At the very least this is a very well crafted disk. There is enough music here to satisfy any fan of Genesis. The first track begins with a fine track written by keyboardist Tony banks. &quot;Eleventh Earl of Mar&quot; paves the way for the rest of the album and giving a taste of what is to come. The next track &quot; One for the Vine&quot; is a long drawn out tune that adds a touch of spice to the album. Clockin in at 10 minutes, &quot;Vine&quot; shows that Genesis is still in that near epic mode. &quot;Your Own Special&quot; has been mentioned as the &quot;one that does not belong&quot; on the CD. I beleive this track is crucial to show fans that they were moving closer to a pop ballad mentality. If you listen carefully, every Genesis album has some kind of ballad sound, not neccesarily romantic though. &quot;Your Own Special Way&quot; does give way to the next phase of the album and does not let up for the &quot;filler&quot; tune &quot;Wot Gorilla? There is nothing wrong with filler especilaly if it is a well crafted instrumental. Every album needs adventure, and that is where we have &quot;All in a Mouses Night&quot;. Long enough to keep you intrested, but short enough of a tune to not make you bored. Then we have the signature tune, &quot;Blood on the Rooftops&quot; which makes for good ear relaxation after hearing the previous moderate to fast tempos of some of the previous tracks. &quot;Rooftops&quot; then segues into the quite artistic instrumentals of &quot;Unquiet Slumbers... and  &quot;In That Quiet Earth&quot;. On may think that these two tunes may end the disk, but no, it would not be like Genesis to end one on an instrumental. Phil makes his outro on &quot;Afterglow&quot; which almost sounds like the outro to &quot;Suppers Ready&quot; off their Foxtrot album. A slow and dragging yet listenable outro. As see I have given 5 stars to this pleasant production. It is quite worth the listen  but only if you are not interrupted by any outside sources. Buy this CD today and enjoy!=o)
B00001QEE7|5.0|The little mermaid is my favourite disney movie.  When I was young, I listened to this movie about a hundred time and I still watch it now.  In case you didn't see this movie, it's the story of a young mermaid (Ariel) who wants to know everything about humans.  She dream to become a human and her dream got realized by the evil witch of the sea Ursula.  Ariel fell in love with Prince Eric but she sould never have trust Ursula.  When she realize it, it's too late for her!!! This movie is a classic!! The biggest problem is that the DVD contain no extra!!! I WANT A TWO DISC SET DVD OF LITTLE MERMAID!!! Why does Beauty and the beast, snow white and lion king got special DVD and not little mermaid.  It's a shame.  I just hope they make one, one day.
B00005QG9J|4.0|I think incubus will progress into a great original band. Once they will hopefully outlive Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit, who they have been unfortunatly mentioned in the same sentence. But i think they are probably the new chili peppers with a faster progression. With songs like Mexico, Warning, Wish you were here, Are you in ? , Tumbing down the river, echo, just a phase, 10 am , They have proven that they can sit down write songs , and not rely on fans who only like distortion. They can still jam like a crazy but like Sytem of a Down they actually have songs which gives them more substance. <BR>i think we should all expect good things from this band.  they have a made a very good album but next they will make a great album.
B000002J1O|5.0|Sit back and take a chair. This disk is like watching a medieval movie, from the start anyway. The first track &quot;Dancing With the Moonlit Knight&quot; is nothing but a great strikingly terrific track. I have no idea what the song is about, but more importantly the music is great and pleasant to the ear. Moving right along we have the flute laden &quot;I Know What I like&quot;. Flute isn't a bad thing and it is definitley not bad here. The song is slightly raw despite the use of some &quot;artsy fartsy&quot; mellotron. Who ever thought a song about a person who mows lawns would be a classic?? This CD gets even better with &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot;. This has to be one of my favourites because of the semi long guitar solo which Steve Hackett belts out. It is sad that he never continued on with the band, but he went onto make some good albums of his own(check out &quot;Spectral Mornings&quot;). Enter Phil Collins on &quot;More Fool Me&quot;. As I can tell, Phil does good on ballads and he makes a slightly good impression here. At first listen as youth I couldn't tell if it was Phil or Peter singing. Lucky for Genesis was a good replacement for vocals. The next track, &quot;Battle of Epping Forest&quot; seems to be the down low on the album. Although not a bad piece of work, it could have been left out, edited or replaced. The track does have its place in the album though hence it tells the tale of gangs in East End of London. Along comes one of my favourite tunes and instrumentals, the raw and underated &quot;After the Ordeal&quot;. I have recently thought, was the &quot;ordeal&quot; the series of events that took place in &quot;The battle of Epping Foret&quot;??? Anyways, &quot;Ordeal&quot; is great ear candy and includes those beautiful piercing compressed guitar solos by Mr. Hackett himself. Lets move forward and talk about the last two tracks, &quot;The Cinema Show&quot; and the &quot;Aisle of Plenty&quot;. &quot;Cinema&quot; segues into &quot;Aisle&quot; beautifully, making this IMHO one of their best outros. I would have to give their &quot;Duke&quot; CD the best outro though. Not to get off track now, &quot;Cinema Show&quot; is the dessert of this disk. Buy this disk today and enjoy the evening with some of Genesis best art rock effort.=o)
B000056V73|2.0|This was really a dull film with not much to engage the viewer. I mean, the subtext was original in a way: the pain of being ugly. And that may be why it's dull. When you see a movie you kind of want to spend a couple hours with beautiful people. Dull, dull, dull.
B000002U9E|5.0|One of the best albums ever released. It is fantastic. The compositions and the production is amazing. Kate beautiful vocals shine and her persona and chemestry is what makes this album even more brilliant. The album is deep, raw , energetic, sexy, beautiful and ORIGINAL. <br />Filled with beautiful songs. Hounds Of Love is one of the better albums released in the mid-80´s. A Comeback for Kate. The album became her most popular album and released also her first US top 40 hit. Running Up That Hill. <br />The album is often brigt yet sometimes dark and mysterious and even though it doesn´t matter what kind of mood your in You are going to love this album no matter what. Everything about is beautiful. The arrangements are heaven, the production by the genius is top notch. the songwriting and the cover I mean it is simple yet one of the most beautiful cover on an album ever released. her vocal range which is very different from her previous albums and the music itself uplifts you and brings you to a mysterious and perhaps a happy and sometimes dark place that you would like to visit again and again and again. <br />It´s an album that deserves 1000 stars and huge respect from all music genres, artist and fans. thanx

B00005JKZT|1.0|Dear readers,<BR>  For those of you that decided that the two towers was a worth while movie I feel an overwhelming sadness for you. I have read the reviews from those that thought that it was a good movie and all I can say is if JRR meant for Aragorn to fall over a cliff,he would have writen it.  I won't bore you with the rantings of a Tolkien aphile and other glaring omitions and additions,those of you who know, know what they are. However when Mr Jackson adds to the story it makes me see red. I find it hard to write this because its all been said before,while it is true that it is impracticle to follow the book word for word, would it have been to much to ask that he get right what he filmed. For those who know maintain the rage because we know that beauty is in the details and for the others, read the book so you too can tell the difference.
B0000026VZ|5.0|Very comprehensive selection of hits from the polished and romantic rock band: TOTO.  This is a fine collection of songs from the talented songwriters and musicians that innovated the influential 80's &quot;WEST COAST SOUND&quot;... well worth it!
B00000I8NC|1.0|while i respect that this album may evoke emotions in other people, i have to state my opinion for the sake of people looking to buy this. i find this to be bland and boring: painfully annoying &quot;build ups&quot; that amount to nothing interesting. i have listened to it a good 15 times all the way through, usually at night when i am in the mood to appreciate subtle music. this just does not work for me. i am a big fan of instrumental music, so i was very surprised at how much i hated this cd. there are a million other bands that seem to be in a similar category as this, that i think are so much better: anything on touch and go records, my bloody valentine, mogwai, tortoise etc...   maybe this is like my bloody valentine's loveless, you either get it or you dont. i do not 'get' what the attraction is to this music.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Hybrid Theory is an album that blows you away with a fresh sound right from the get-go. Now that this sound is established, it's hard to recreate that freshness. I kept that in mind when listening to Meteora. Most bands who start off explosively have nowhere to go but down, getting worse and worse (Bush, Korn). I was afraid this would happen to Linkin Park. When I first heard their sophmore album I didn't like it but for a few songs. But it does continue to grow on me as we speak. Their sound is consistent and they experiment with a few new things. &quot;Numb&quot; is hands down the best song on here. Not a bad album, but not enough to be better than their first.
B00004XONN|5.0|this is an amazing and beautiful, as well as original album, and i was pretty shocked when i saw that it only had a 4 star rating. the flow on this album is great, and the melodies are beautiful AND existant! (some reviewers need to listen carefully). i had my doubts about this album, and i thought i wouldnt like it when it came out, but i think it is easily the best album radiohead has done so far.
0312305060|5.0|I found this like-new book hidden between the beaten-up volumes of a rummage sale.  I didn't know at the time that The Hours would be released as a hyped-up movie.  With performances by Nicole Kidman, Meryl Streep, and Julianne Moore, the film has been nominated for eleven Oscars.<br />The novel takes its roots from Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, a 1925 novel that recently hit the best-seller lists again.  Woolf chronicles a single day in the life of the title character.  That's exactly what the author of The Hours does, times three: He recounts a day in the lives of three women.<br />Strangely, the Michael Cunningham (who won the Pulitzer Prize for this work) dedicates 226 pages solely to women.  Anyone who reads this book should run through the extra couple hundred pages of Mrs. Dalloway, because Woolf's work forms the basis of The Hours.  At first I questioned the merit of a novel that takes its inspiration from another, but Cunnigham's colorful prose and masterful plot converted me.<br />Virginia Woolf steps onto the stage first in the act of suicide.  This short scene highlights the theme of the novel: the struggle with depression and isolation.  One minor character expresses the loneliness of the whole novel in two sentences: \\"But there are still the hours, aren't there?  One and then another, and you get through that one and then, my god, there's another.\\"  Perhaps that's why Cunningham (and Woolf) limited their stories to a single day to show how treacherous those hours are.<br />The reader watches as Woolf (as portrayed by Cunningham in The Hours) agonizes over her work-in-progress, which the reader will soon recognize as Mrs. Dalloway.  In the next chapter Cunningham takes us to a woman living in today's bustling mess of New York City; her nickname is \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\"  Her story turns out to be a contorted version of Woolf's actual book: Names are reused but identities switched. <br />Next, the author transports the reader back the 1950s American suburbia.  Mrs. Brown, a humble housewife who ought to be happy, tries to escape from her insipid life by reading Mrs. Dalloway.  Later, she literally does escape from her family, abandoning her son.  Cunningham later reveals (in a clever linkage of the past and the present) that the abandoned son is now Mrs. Dalloway's friend who uttered the lines above.<br />Cunningham fuses distant eras in this conglomeration of concise chapters.  His writing kept me reading for hours straight just as The Lovely Bones did, but avoided clichéd phrases and plots.  This isn't a morbid account of depression, but a document of a thirst for life, a \\"new day in which anything might happen, anything at all.\\"

0316666343|3.0|My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie.  I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973.  And so begins the narrative of a girl not living anymore.<br />After ascending to heaven (a place that the author portrays as not too different from earth), Susie finds herself engrossed in the lives of those who shes left: her father, mother, sister, brother, and boyfriend.  <br />This is a coming-of-age-story in two ways.  Susie herself grows up in heaven, learning that she will have to eventually stop engrossing herself in the lives of those she had left on Earth.  Susie also watches as her 11-year-old sister, Lindsey, becomes a stunning college graduate and fiancée of a motorcycle boy.<br />Susies father has trouble letting go of Susie years after her death.  Susies mother cannot deal with the familys grief and escapes into the arms of a widower police detective, and later, to the vineyards of California.<br />The author, Alice Sebold, also explores contact between the living and the dead.  Ruth, a school acquaintance of Susies, finds herself caught in the Salmon familys grief because of a chance accident: As Susies soul leaves her body and rises to heaven, it brushes by Ruth in the street. <br />Ruth immerses herself in poetry and an unhealthy obsession over the female victims of serial killers.  The novels climaxa staggering moment that links Ruth, Susie, and Susies boyfriendstunned and made the hours spent reading the novel worthwhile.<br />However, originality stops there.  Sebolds style is short and simple, though a little bland.  Her premise for the book is novel and sound good in principle, but not in practice.  Sebold too often resorted to caricatures of people on earth: the grief-stricken father, the eccentric killer, the discontented mother.  <br />One of my favorite parts, however, were the descriptions of life in heaven.  In one poignant scene, Susie waltzes with her grandfather in the moonlight asdogs gather round.  I wish the rest of the novel had been so lovely.
0380778556|5.0|Having discovered the incredible works of Daphne du Maurier long ago, I can only wonder why I had never read her most renowned and classic novel.  Probably just as well too, because I'd probably not have appreciated du Maurier's exquisite mastery of suspense-building.  Most of her novels are definite page-turners, keeping the reader firmly with grasp; this work not only grasps, it gropes!.  Memorable characters, even if not particularly loveable ones.  Dame Daphne left us with some great reading and this surely is indeed one of her best and probably one of the greatest novels of the 20th Century.

B00000AOUD|1.0|The original version of this record was great, but IT WAS NOT A CONCEPT ALBUM!<BR> <BR>A concept album is a collection of songs bound by a single (or, in the case of David Bowie's \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" or Jethro Tull's \\"Aqualung\\", a bifurcated) conceit. (This doesn't mean every song in a concept album has necessarily to do explicitly with the conceit.) \\"Thick as a Brick\\" purports to be ONLY ONE SONG. It is thus NOT a collection of songs, and it is thus NOT a concept album. <br />Jethro Tull maintains that \\"Thick as a Brick\\" was the first one-song rock LP. That may be so, but Pink Floyd previously released two one-song rock LP sides: \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" and \\"Echoes\\". Bob Dylan also previously released a one-song LP side: \\"Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\\". What prevented Pink Floyd and Bob Dylan from going \\"all the way\\", as it were? Possibly the circumstance that since vinyl discs have two recorded sides, a one-song vinyl disc's song has to be interrupted, compromising its one-song-edness. Ian Anderson took this rather obvious problem into some account at least when composing and recording \\"Thick as a Brick\\" and adapted bits of the music accordingly, such that any (single) CD version does not to this extent represent the song accurately.<br />I mention this because the \\"remastering\\" we find here, which is really merely a monkeying about with, constitutes not a more \\"faithful\\" version, only a different (and to my taste inferior) version. That the music for what used to be the very end of side one and the very beginning of side two remains unaltered here demonstrates that Jethro Tull allowed \\"Thick as a Brick\\" to be monkeyed about with not for artistic reasons, but instead cynically as a ... marketing device. Jethro Tull was manifestly not concerned here to adapt the song to a technologically different medium
0066620996|5.0|Collins' research into eleven public companies over a thirty year period provides important insights into corporate success. I was impressed by the emphasis on the right people -- instead of people in general -- as the greatest asset of a company.  I also respect Collins' suggestion to &quot;Confront the brutal facts.&quot;  Optimism is a bad strategy when the price of failure or probability of failure are high.  Good to Great provides the leap from mediocre thinking to extraordinarily positive thinking for a company. In the optimal thinking corporate world, good and great performance are considered positive, but suboptimal.  Leaders and employees are using optimal thinking to be their best.  I recommend this book highly because of its unique perspective and scientifically valid research.
B000089A07|3.0|First let's start with the obvious: the reason that Red Dragon was made was due to the success of Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal. The former film wasn't produced by Dino DeLaurentiis. He passed on it after the box office failure of Michael Mann's terrific thriller Manhunter (based on the same novel as this film).<br />Manhunter was a terrific thriller. Yes, it has all the earmarks of a film made in the 80's but what film doesn't reflect the decade it was made in? Red Dragon is a good retelling of the same tale. Brett Ratner's film isn't an improvement as much as a refinement; Manhunter was really more about the conflict between Will (the FBI profiler)and the killer he was hunting. It also was about his attempt to recover from a mental breakdown that occurred as a result of Will's face off with Lecter.<br />Red Dragon has an enlarged role for the character of Lecter. Ted Tally's screenplay keeps the basic plot intact and, in fact, Manhunter isn't significantly different plot wise from Red Dragon. The difference is the size of the role of Hanninbal Lecter and the pathology that drives the Toothfairy to kill in this film. Red Dragon benefits from the prologue that Thomas Harris added to the novel after the success of Silence of the Lambs. That key scene reflects the relationship and showdown between Will Graham and Hannibal Lecter. While that was alluded to in Manhunter, it's presented in full from the novel.<br />Ratner dismissed Mann's film stating that his was closer to the novel. While that is generally true, it doesn't necessarily make Ratner's film any better than Mann's. Mann's film had a huge impact on the look, feel and sound of many of the films of the 80's. His influence on thrillers and action films (as well as television)had a much deeper impact than this thriller ever could.<br />Ratner's film is more of a reflection of Silence; in fact Ratner's film fits in well with Jonathan Demme's classic film. It's a follower, not a leader despite the terrific cast, fine screenplay and sharp direction. That doesn't dimish the impact of the film; Red Dragon is a fine thriller and very enjoyable. For fans of Silence this would be the film to start with vs. Manhunter. Manhunter is the better film overall but there's a sense of continuity here missing (naturally since Manhunter was made well before Silence was made)that audience's will enjoy.<br />It's like comparing Dangerous Liaisons to Valmont--both are terrific films that tell the same story. One film focuses more on being a mundane thriller while the other has higher ambitions. You can of course decide which is which.ast, fine screenplay and sharp direction.

0385504209|5.0|I work at a bookstore. A little over a month ago, we got an advanced copy of this book and a letter from the publisher and thought nothing more of it. The next week, we got a letter from our home office asking us to read the book before its release. I was the first to read it. I was completely amazed, suprised, and delighted to find The Da Vinci Code a very refreshing read.<br />The book is based on the idea that the Holy Grail is actually Mary Magadaline and that the early church hid documents and changed who she actually was in order to further its own cause. Taken from actual historical and theological works and ideas, Dan Brown crafts a remarkable story around a 2000 year old controversy.<br />Robert Langdon is a professor at Harvard suddenly finding himself mixed up in the bizarre murder of the Louvre's curator. As the story moves on, there are many twists, turns and shocking suprises that are completely unexpected. Helped by Sophie, a French cop, Langdon helps to unravel the mystery of the Holy Grail and the secret society that watches over it.<br />This book is truly amazing and has lead me to consider other books with similar ideas like \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\" and the \\"Templar Revelation\\" among others. If you have any interest in Christianity at all, read the book!
B00008H2LB|5.0|Meteora is an outstanding new album released by Linkin Park. Whilst being very short in overall length, the album almost completely matches up to their original album favourite, Hybrid Theory. Included in the album are 13 songs.<br />Foreword: Simply a foreword, it blends into the second song quite nicely. Grade: -<BR>Don't Stay: A very nice heavy guitar song to start off with. Conveys the main message of album thoroughly. Very nice mixing work in the background. Also makes notice of Chester's screaming ability. Grade: B<BR>Somewhere I Belong: A rather positive outlook on life. This song has a surprisingly interesting introduction as it gets into the song. The ending is very drawn out and can be repeatative or even annoying at high volume levels. Still this piece is one of my favourites on the album. Grade: A<BR>Lying From You: One of the better songs on the CD for sure. A very offtone song for Linkin Park. The lyrics meld into the song very nicely. Chester proves his singing ability in this song nicely. Grade: A<BR>Hit The Floor: My personal favourite on the CD. I've always been a fan of Chester's singing and Mikes rapping. They're brought together very nicely in this song. The upbeat rock is very catchy, loud but simple. Grade: A+<BR>Easier to Run: Chester has very nice vocals in this piece. The song is one of the calmer pieces on the album. This song shows similar characteristics to Crawling from Hybrid Theory, as it launched into the Chorus, then goes into the first verse. However this piece lost points for me because of its simplicity compared to the other songs on the CD. By itself this song is outstanding. Grade: A-<BR>Faint: This is one of my personal least favourites on the CD. The introduction is downright annoying. It gets better as you delve into the song a little bit, but that annoying introduction keeps popping up. Mikes vocals tie in well with the general tune. Chesters worst song on the CD. Grade: C+<BR>Figure.09: Best guitarwork in this piece. A very typical Linkin Park song. The chorus is very catchy and I find I cannot get it out of my head, however unlike other songs it doesn't become annoying. The title's originality scores points from me. Grade: A<BR>Breaking The Habit: The message in this song is very encouraging. Unfortunately the song is very simple and has another annoying introduction which repeats over and over through the entire song. Perhaps this song would have scored better if it had been a little more intense in the bassline. Vocals are superb, very nice attempt by the band to go in a different direction. Grade: B+<BR>From The Inside: This song reminds me of 'Pushing me Away' from Hybrid Theory, even more so the ReAnimation version. The vocals in this song by both Mike and Chester are among the best in the CD. Definately the most passionate song on the CD, as Chester supplies background vocals to Mikes rapping for a change. Grade: A<BR>Nobody's Listening: A very typical rapping song by Linkin Park. Unfortunately I absolutely loathe this song. Rapping fans will love this. The Japanese flute does something nice to this piece. It's too simple for me with very little guitar, which awarded it the lowest grade on the CD. Grade: C-<BR>Session: Outstanding Instrumental. Reading other reviews, this track hasn't pleased many at all. Drum and Instrumentals have always worked well for me. Mr Hahn's work at its best here with the drumwork. Several steps above Cure for the Itch. This piece is yet to lose its charm for me. Grade: A<BR>Numb: This final piece disappointed me a bit. Possibly because I read so many reviews on it that said it was good, I had my expectations up high. It's a fine piece indeed. Closing nicely with both Chester and Mike showing their best. Unfortunately doesn't stand out as anything too interesting. Grade: B+<br />Overall Grade: A-<BR>This Album stands out as Linkin Park's equal best next to Hybrid Theory. Although it is only 37 minutes long, there are several songs on it capable of being single hits. I personally would rather have a CD full of good songs than one with one or two good songs on it, and the rest are simply space fillers or money grabbers. This album is a must-have for all fans of Hybrid Theory. Anyone that enjoys rapping and/or heavy guitar work will like this album just as much. The messages conveyed in this album are suited for almost anyone, so there is no particular target audience other than everyone who feels like listening. Worth the Money, worth the time to listen, and well worth a moment of recognition or two.
B000002UEB|2.0|A coworker loaned me this CD with the promise that he was doing me a favor I didn't yet realize. I have to disagree, though, because this album is nothing special. It all sounds exaclty like any other music you'd expect to hear from this era, and could easily be mistaken as Def Leppard or Poison by the casual listener. There's nothing really bad in here, but there's also nothing to make you sit up and take notice. None of the songs really differentiate themselves if you listen to the album straight through, and the album itself just seems lackluster and monotonous. It's OK, but I can think of a lot of things I'd recommend before it.

I personally would rather have a CD full of good songs than one with one or two good songs on it, and the rest are simply space fillers or money grabbers. This album is a must-have for all fans of Hybrid Theory. Anyone that enjoys rapping and/or heavy guitar work will like this album just as much. The messages conveyed in this album are suited for almost anyone, so there is no particular target audience other than everyone who feels like listening. Worth the Money, worth the time to listen, and well worth a moment of recognition or two.
B000068W42|5.0|This, the 3rd album from So. Cal robot-rockers Queens of the Stone Age has been largely recognized for the drumming presence of former Nirvana and current Foo Fighters member Dave Grohl, who picked up the sticks and played on all but one song on this amazing album. But although the drums can't be overlooked, the main draw into this album should be the diverse styles. It goes from screaming punk metal w/ Nick Oliveri on vocals to the soft growl of former Screaming Trees frontman Mark Lanegan and back to Homme, the vocalist on the radio hit, &quot;No One Knows&quot;. This is a concept album, it's supposed to be what you might hear on the radio on a drive from Los Angeles to the Joshua Tree in California, Queens of the Stone Age style. But even if you don't get the concept, if you &quot;get&quot; good music, then you should definitely &quot;Get&quot; this album.
B000089RVX|5.0|I had gotten this CD a week ago today and I haven't stop playing it since then. I haven't played a CD this much since I got \\"The Queen of the Damned\\" Soundtrack last year. This is one of the most original CDs of the year, and originality is a lot in this world of Avrils and Christinas.<br />Amy Lee is got one of the best voices, sensual and dark. She reminds me of Sarah McLachlan and Free Dominguez of Kidneythieves. <br />The lyrics are awesome, not pathetic love songs but some deep recollection. The riffs are dark with some blendings of Linkin Park but it makes it even better.<br />Two more things, one this group is not goth and second, if you like Evanescence, try the Kidneythieves, they are similiar
B000089RVX|1.0|If you wanna hear a good band check out Lacuna Coil. Lacuna Coil has female vocals over beautiful metal music. Evanescence is just a mainstream mindless nu metal band with a not so good female vocalist. Lacuna Coil is the band you should be listening to, they actually have talent and mix female vocals with REAL metal instead of cheesy nu metal. This cd doesn't even get stars due to the fact it was made for the simple fact that the musicians are money hungry. AVOID THIS CD IT IS HORRIBLE.
B00006DEF9|5.0|I know you've heard it all before, but I'm going to tell you again. This is a top notch film. The glittering costumes, the glittering characters, and the glittering dance steps make this classic musical a blinding, glittering experience.<br />There's not a whole lot I can say about this film in only 1,000 words, but I'll try and keep it short:<br />The songs and the tap-dancing are probably the best parts of this film. No one can possibly keep their eyes off Gene Kelly when he gets started. And Debbie Reynolds is just enchanting.<br />I have to say, though, my favorite character is Lena Lamont, the fairly insane movie star who makes &quot;more money than Calvin Coolidge... put together!&quot; Who can resist a dumb blonde every now and then.<br />A must see for the whole, extended family. And don't forget friends as well.
B00006ALGL|5.0|Not just the most moving and heartfelt album I have bought in many years, but also the most intelligent and complex. An album to last for years. Many of the tracks play that trick of being personal to you.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Forget what the people who gave this movie bad reviews said. This is movie was a limited release in theatres, ... Dont get me wrong, The Matrix is absolutely one of the best movies i have ever seen, but this surpasses the Matrix in its style. It has a good plot, that will keep you entertained in the non-fighting scenes, and the fighting scenes get better througout the movie. By the end of this movie you will be blown away, at how amzingly well made, and how satisfiing it is.
B00004XQP4|5.0|This is an album that I knew was coming because it was the next step in their evolution, but I also new that all the cool punk rockers would hate it, and this album would recieve a mixed reception. Well for those who understand how music works, and understand that in order for a band to have longevity they must evolve, if not they rot away into a land of obscurity and redundancy. This album definately turns over a new leaf for the band. If you listened to \\"nimrod.\\" you knew this was coming, there was hints of it all over that album. I wouldn't expect any of their forthcoming albums to use this many acoustics or alternate instruments as they did on this. They tend to re-invent their sound for every album, and because of that, they made this one of my favorite albums, and I just can't stop playing it.<br />The opening, self-titled track is a simple chord progression all acoustic song, that talks about questioning authority, but very catchy at the same time. <br />One of the oddest Green Day songs comes in the form of track # 6 \\"Misery\\", if you're not open to new things then this one isn't for you. I on the other hand love it. It's over 5 minutes long and includes such instruments as a farfisa organ, accordian and some other ones that I can't remember off the top of my head. It's sort of a gypsy song that tells a very interesting story. You'll just have to hear it for yourself.<br />Among my personal favorite tracks on this album are \\"Church On Sunday\\", a love song BJ wrote for his wife Adrienne about compromise in a relationship, \\"Deadbeat Holiday\\", \\"Hold On\\", and their greatest ballad \\"Macy's Day Parade\\".<br />The other songs on this album are very good, but don't believe me, just listen for yourself and judge. The only downside to this album is that it includes the only Green Day song that I don't particularily like \\"Minority\\", but hell it sure beats 95% of the [other things] out there today.
B00008GKEG|5.0|When this series first aired on television in 1995, I was very happy to see it. Very very interesting, I love watching shows dealing with music history. Other than some archival soundbytes, there is no narration in this mini-series. The story is told by the Beatles themselves (as well as appearances by George Martin and others). Some time after being televised, it was released on VHS but at the time I found it quite expensive, and also I must have known that DVD was on the horizon. So I decided not to buy it on tapes. And I promptly forgot about it. Then in March 2003, I was searching on the internet for something totally unrelated when I stumbled upon the news that The Beatles Anthology was to be released on DVD about two weeks from the time I discovered the news. Fantastic I thought. I bought it only a couple of days after it came out and am very happy with it. The first time it was shown on television it was heavily edited into 3 x 2 hour episodes (approx). So it was terrific to see all the stuff we missed out on the first time around. The bonus disc has interesting tidbits, showing the boys recalling those incredible times in their past, having a bit of a jam session, and putting together \\"Free As A Bird\\" and \\"Real Love\\", the Beatles tracks of the '90s. This is the sort of mini-series that all Beatles fans and those interested in music history in general must have in their collection. It is the story of the most successful musical group of the twentieth century, perhaps of all time.
B00008MNYS|5.0|Escapology has got to be Robbie Williams's best CD to date. With a unique mix of tracks, this CD is sure to be a hit in the U.S. It's hard to pick stand-out tracks because they're all so great, so I'll just review a few:<br />Feel- This song gives me the chills every time I hear it. The vocals are extraordianry. Robbie pours everything into this song, and it's easy to see why it is such a hit in the UK.<br />Something Beautiful<br />Me and My Monkey- I love Rob's sense of humor! This song is catchy, fun, and hilarious to listen to. It will entertain you every time.<br />I hope you'll buy Robbie's CD! I guarantee you won't regret it.<br />(We always knew he was the most talented member of Take That.)
B00003CWN3|4.0|'Boys Don't Cry'is a honest and at times sad story about the story of Brandon Teena. This film is charming, compelling yet the outcome is sad. What drew me to liking this film is the love story between Brandon and Lana. Hilery Swank did a fantastic, believeable job of portraying the ... identity crisis of Teena Brandon. Chloe' Sevigny was mesmerizing as Lana. There was fantastic chemistry between the two, and I completely understood what the director was saying. This is a important film that should be seen with a important massage. By Justine Ryan

B00005AAFS|5.0|Rammsetein are just to put it simply one of my favorite bands ever! They're just so very diffent and appealing. Maybe it's all the bleeps and noises, awsome guitar work or just simply that thye just sing in German. The two guitarists weave in throughout each other, the singer has a very deep, deep voice, the bassist and drummer make a very good rythm section and their keyboardist is amazing. One of the other cool things is that even though you can't understand them your head is banging at the heavy metal parts and a song like Mutter makes you feel very emotional. Here is the track by track review:<BR>Mein Herz Brennt-Very cool, awsome little keyborad thing inbetween choruses. 5/5<BR>Links 234-Awsmoe German march song which in English is Left two, three, four. My second favorite song on the album. 5/5<BR>Sonne-Breathtaking chorus. 4/5<BR>Ich Will-Favorite track ont the whole CD. I really like the bleeping the keyboardist keep s using and when some words are sung and then like an audience calls back. 7/5<BR>Feuer Frei!-Cool song that was on the Triple X soundtrack, can't believe all music called this song dunder-headed. 5/5<BR>Mutter-Slower song, very powerful, maybe tied with Ich Will for my favorite. 5/5<BR>Spieluhr-Okay track. 4/5<BR>Zwitter-Ehh. 4/5<BR>Adios-Better than preivious two. 4 and a half/5<BR>Nebel-Good closing. 5/5<BR>Buy this CD if you are a fan of metal in general, you will love it. I soon hope to get their other albums as well. Very, very good!
B000084T18|3.0|I was thinking 50 could be one of the very few keepin it real, but I knew it was too good to be true, because he can't rapl it's al about good beats nowdays.

Eminem)-this is where 50 just has a weak flow, and eminem needs to quit tryin to be gangsta, cuz he aint, nice beat tho 7/10<BR>4. Many Men (Wish Death)-In this song 50 makes a very good story about bein shot, and it has a good beat 9/10  <BR>5. In Da Club-50's pop song, he can't rap in this sing, and the beats ok, and this song got way to overplayed 5/10  <BR>6. High All the Time-Very good beat, horrible flow as always  6/10     <BR>7. Heat-Another good beat, but the braging about getting shot, and all the drug stories are getting old 7/10        <BR>8. If I Can't:Nice beat, but yet again, this man is givin me a migrane with his horrible flows 7/10        <BR>9. Blood Hound (feat. Young Buck of G Unit)Oh no a bad beat, and no flows, pretty bad song 3/10        <BR>10. Back Down-This got a ok beat, But I don't even have to say why this song is bad         <BR>11. P.I.M.P.-He just got weak at the ending with the beats which sux 4/10        <BR>12. Like My Style (feat. Tony Yayo of G Unit)-This has an ok beat, but the lyrics need work        <BR>13.

But at least it's better tan  Nelly Ja-Rule, and Jay-Z(Thank god).  If u like real hip hop or good lyrics, u might wanna borrow this or burn it, but if u like beats heres the brand new flava for ya ear
B00005YXZH|5.0|The Wilco boys have grown up into mature musicians in so many ways. Not only has Jeff Tweedy grown as a songwriter, but as a guitar player as well. Those looking for the frat boy favorites such as &quot;Casino Queen&quot; may not appreciate YHF because this record is not about instant gratification. It is about letting the music in. If you relax and listen, the songs, &quot;Poor Places,&quot; &quot;Jesus, etc.&quot; will get under your soul and break your heart -- in the best way possible. Buy for yourself and a friend. I did.
0671027344|5.0|This book convinced me to read again after having been scared by bad books in school since the third grade.  Between my friends and me, it goes down in history as the best book ever written.
B000001F3C|5.0|I don't care what anyone else says; this is the definitive U2 album. It's a potent mix of their earlier heavy punk-influenced sound (Boy, October), and their later, more successful works (from Joshua Tree on). Their sense of melody, profound lyrics, aggression, and social commentary all shine on this album, on songs like &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday,&quot; &quot;New Years Day,&quot; &quot;Like a Song,&quot; and &quot;Drowning Man.&quot; Mainly Bono's vocals/lyrics and Edge's resonant guitar sound their best on this album, and Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen provide a great rhythm section. If you must buy any U2 album, make it War.
B000089RVX|1.0|That's what this reminds me of, but worse.
0880389052|5.0|Meet a character that is incredibly noble, incredibly good and unselfish--and someone we can actually stand without retching. (Goodbye, Tanis! Goodbye, Sturm!)Not to say that Drizzt is 'perfect' as a being, he has his childish flaws too but as heroes go, he's an epitome of one. <br />The drow are a cruel race of elves. They live in the Underdark and in the great city of Menzoberranzan, intrigue and plots are always afoot. Cruel ambition is greatly encouraged, outside and inside the family.<br />Even as a child, Drizzt had never felt himself belong to such a race. Cruelty comes unnaturally to him and as he grew older, he was horrified at the actions of his fellow drow. He could not escape though. Where would he go? To the surface, where he would be further persecuted? Thus, he kept silence and despite his disdain for the drow, he was spared for he was one of the greateast warriors among the drow.<br />Until one time, Drizzt found himself right in the middle of the most cruel act done by the drow in his eyes. He knew then he had to escape.<br />R.A. Salvatore writes vividly and dramatically the events that happened in the life of Drizzt Do'Urden, one of the most prominent characters of Forgotten Realms. As a first book of the trilogy, Homeland is gripping and will make you like Drizzt and admire him for who he is.<br />Drizzt is a special character, in my opinion. Few characters ever stand out and become a, shall we say, symbol, for some people. Perhaps it's because depsite having human flaws, Drizzt makes an effort to do the right thing and the way Salvatore delivers it makes him more acceptable and admirable instead of impossible; we don't see a 'knight' or a 'saint'.<br />Homeland will immediately hook you to read the succeeding books of this trilogy.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This cd is a great cd, I don't know why everyone is complaining about it being short Linkin Parks first album was only 37 minutes long.  If you are a fan then get this cd.<br />1. Forward - 5/5 good intro<BR>2. Don't Stay - 5/5 Love this song cause the lyrics really home with me cause I have been in that situation.<BR>3. Somewhere I Belong - 5/5 good song and also this is not a &quot;In the End&quot; clone I don't know why people are saying that.<BR>4. Lying from You - 5/5 Great song probably third favorite<br />5. Hit the Floor - 5/5 this is my favorite track I love the song has a great beat to it.<BR>6. Easier to Run - 5/5 this is a great song from Linkin Park<BR>7. Faint - 4/5 this is a pretty fast song just not one of my favs<BR>8. Figure 8 - 5/5 My second favorite song on the cd.<BR>9. Breaking the Habit - 4/5 I like this song but it is a lot different from other Linkin Park songs<BR>10. From the Inside - 5/5 I like this song it is one of best<BR>11. Nobody's Listening - 4/5 this is a pretty good song<BR>12. Session - 5/5 right up there with cure for an itch<BR>13. Numb - 5/5 I love this song it reminds me of &quot;Pushing me away&quot;
B00005JKZV|5.0|This movie is great! I loved the battle at helms deep and seeing the treehearders stomping everything. It has more fighting than the first{which I like}. And also gollem is just as he was in the book. it differs a littel from the book though,but who cares            =-)<br />delta904
B0000640VO|5.0|The opening of this movie was a little bizzar, but it certainly got my attention. The characters in the movie are introduced by the narrator, who includes the odd things they do for a simple perk (ie: Amelie likes to dip her hand into a sack of beans at the market). Plus, I've never actually seen (or wanted to see) a baby popping out of its mother. That was a little bit of a shock.<br />As I'm sure you've heard, Amelie is about a waitress that makes it her duty to help people without their knowledge. She's very introverted, which started because her father, a doctor, believed she had a heart problem and kept her home-schooled. Instead of meeting and talking to people, she kind of observes them from the background when she can.<br />The first good deed she did was an accident. She discovers a box hidden behind a lose tile in her bathroom, and feels the need to return it, which begins the search for its owner. This leads to another thing, and another, and Amelie begins to get ideas and inspirations from everything around her. Her daydreams tend to be funny and oddly real (as in, the part most Americans keep tucked away for fear it will make them look idiotic), and her imagination is great.<br />The settings and acting in this were fabulous as far as I understood, and the story was the type that leaves you oddly happy. When it was over, the only thing I was able to do was gush out, \\"Wow,\\" to nobody in particular.

0689835604|5.0|\\"Where Is Baby's Belly Button? A Lift-the-Flap Book\\" - by Karen Katz.<br />As an ESL and newcomers classroom teacher (A newcomers classroom is for children who have been in country for less than a year, speak English as a second language and such classrooms use scaffolded methods of teaching in hopes of being able to transition these children to a mainstream classroom), I often have to be innovative in how to teach primary and intermediate children basic language skills that mainstream children of their own grade level would consider \\"baby\\" lessons.<br />Books like this one are a God-send. I can drill this book a few times a week at the beginning of the school year and within a few weeks, all of my students have the parts of the body from this book down pat. My older children (intermediates - 4th to 6th grade) at first objected to the book, but then they started having fun and forgot about the book being a \\"baby\\" book.<br />The book itself is a series of flap pages with big bright easy-to-read text. After one reads the text, they can flip up the flap and reveal the part of the body being taught on the page. It is constructed of cardboard and heavy card stock. The simple language phrases such as \\"Where is baby's belly button?\\" are easy for children to memorize and use. The bright colorful illustrations serve to bring out the text and allow easy recognition of the parts of the body.  <br />I highly recommend this book for infants, younger ESL (English as a Second Language) learners, and younger children in general. <br />Review by: Maximillian Ben Hanan
B00006F7S4|5.0|I never knew who Beck really was before reading the five-star review of SEA CHANGE in rolling stone. I was intrigued by this album, and quickly downloaded a couple of songs off the album. I was enraptured by these tales of heartbreak and misery. Beck's songs are really strong, and are backed up by great electric guitar, piano, and orchestra additions. Easily one of the best albums of 2002.
B000002L75|4.0|This was the first album I ever heard by Depeche Mode, at the age of 11 or 12 and after a number of listens I was well and truly hooked. The first point of fascination was the interesting and obscure art work on the sleeve for the record. Sometimes the visual impression of a record cover is so well suited to the music, the two almost become synonomous. Almost like a screen still from captured from a film or a photograph taken without the knowledge of the subjects - very evocative and 'storylike'. The first impression created by the sleeve triggered an interest in hearing the music.The  quality of the music left a lasting impression, with its rather avant-garde edge lurking just underneath the stylised dance-pop flavour of the music.<br />Simple on the surface, but with lots clever hooks and subtle touches that shine through on repeated listens, great thumping electronic grooves (discernable Kraftwork influences) complementing David Gahan's majestically morose baritone, a good variation in overall mood and so on.After that the music really defies any informative description - Kraftwerk meets Bowie? Duran Duran meets Eizerdzende Neubauten? Stockhausen meets Stock/Aiken/Waterman? Maybe not. Danceable music but also quite dark,turbulent even, in a way. Good fodder for the ears, being music put together with great intelligence and regard for impact - a testament to the generally overlooked abilities of songwriter Martin Gore. Sort of a disco album that would enjoyed by the progressive rock set - or dance music for the \\"Upwardly Mobile Homo Sapien\\".<br />This album was the sound of a musical act starting to find it's feet and move past it's rather amateurish beginnings. The first in what would be a fruitful line of good releases.<br />Recommended? Yes.

0064407667|3.0|In Lemony Snicket's, \\"The Bad Beginning,\\" the Bauldaire children are faced with catastrophe after catastrophe. The author does indeed earn a few \\"good\\" points in this book. To mention a few: He defines many difficult to understand words and describes the meaning in context. Also, he winds this tale in such a way that the reader feels as though he/she is sitting around a fire, listening to these frightful events. <BR>     On the other hand, I find a few problems with the content that I cannot overlook. As both a teacher and a parent, I don't feel that the content of the book is appropriate for this age group. For example, the general mood of the plot is dreary and hopeless: a mood that I don't want my child focusing on all hours of the night, as any good story line tends to do to children. In addition, Snicket refers to a bank robbery and the manner in which one would mastermind such a plan: again, a well-planned crime is not on my list of teahable information. Next, Snicket makes a number of references to the eldest of the children, Violet, that are sexual in nature. Any reader, at this target age, can figure out his intentions when the evil-doer, Count Olaf, mentions her beauty and strokes her face continuously throughout the book. Also, the idea that an infant is to be dangled from a delapitated tower for 2 days may leave children with a VERY false idea that an infant could go without food, changings, etc.. for this period of time and only yell out, upon her release, that she would like \\"cake.\\" This angle is sick in itself without any elaboration on the idea of child abuse. E.A. Poe may not have committed the crimes that he concocts, but I certainly would not want my children associated with him! Last, Snicket mentions that he is not allowed, by law, to enter an area of land that is probably near you (speaking to the reader). This statement in itself leads one to believe that the speaker is NOT a law abiding citizen and has been punished by being banned from MY home town. Why then, would I want to delve into this speaker's mind? As a child, I'm guessing that this would arouse a sense of danger and overwhelm my curiosity. Again, this is NOT a curiosity that I want my child being curious about. <BR>     Some of these points may seem minor to some people, but if there is anything that I have learned, it is that good influences breed good ambitions; likewise, bad influences breed a poor sense of judgement and dangerous curiosities. As a 6th grade teacher, I would be extremely apprehensive in reading this to my students, and my child for that matter. Again, as an adult, I applaud Snicket's writing skills; otherwise, I do not feel that the content of this book is fit for budding youngsters. If Mr. Snicket were to decide to \\"up\\" the vocabulary, increase the age of the child characters, and extend the length of the book, then this would be both interesting reading and appropriate for an older audience. Until then, I will choose to label this \\"Bad Beginning\\" as it really is: a bad beginning for this age group.
B000002LHX|5.0|I love this soundtrack. It's very hard to find in the stores though.  It's been underrated since it's release in '89.  &quot;Batdance&quot; is my favorite song off of this album. Unfortunately, none of these songs are on &quot;The Hits&quot; or &quot;The Very Best of&quot;...What happened? But anyway, I think songs like &quot;The Future&quot; and &quot;Scandalous&quot; are Prince classics.  This is a short album in the tradition of &quot;Around The World In A Day&quot; or &quot;Parade&quot;.  Prince gets right down to business. This soundtrack works better than most because there's a common theme.  So while this album has been all but forgotten, it's still worth the money. A Prince essential.
0789723107|5.0|In a world of overinflated designer egos and concomitantly overinflated books on usability, Krug's minimum opus is very refreshing.  Krug successfully elucidates some situations in which simply copying [website] and [website] is not the best course of action.  Five stars because it is a bright spot in an otherwise bleak landscape.
B000068MKZ|5.0|A friend in Paris put me on to this album -- i would never have even considered something by a model turned singer but this is excellent music -- well written, well performed, highly addictive. A real talent.
B000001Y5J|5.0|This was the first Nine Inch Nails album that I ever bought and remains my favorite. No tracks you have to skip (unless you count the 91 black ones ;-), no annoying rants about athiesm and all that not-good stuff, just 30 minutes of pure anger, placed on record for your listening pleasure. As an owner of over 200 CD's, many of them belonging to extreme metal bands, I think that it is telling if I say that this is the angriest CD in my collection. If you have anger management problems (or like to rock), then do not hesitate to get yourself a copy of this. If you love everybody, think that the world is a beautful place, and/or have a major phobia of heavily distorted guitars, then please listen to something else. This is not for the weak-stomached.
B00005OM4N|2.0|I thought that Britney's first two CDs were great, but this just didn't make the cut for me. This album clearly shows that Britney wants to prove to the world that she's not a teenybopper by wearing even more outrageous outfits, and trying to sound mature and sexy. She also tries to cuss a little in \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\", and she tries to sound sexy and nasty in \\"Boys\\", but I'm sorry to say it's not working. Many songs, such as \\"What It's Like To Be Me\\" and \\"Overprotected\\" still had that teenybopper ring that was apparent in her first CD. I think that Britney should really stop trying to be someone she's not, (like Christina Aguilera) but actually sing the right type of music that works for her that was in her first two CDs. I hope that Britney will put out a better CD next time that will have people actually glad to listen to.
B00008H2LB|5.0|To all you people dissing it you are totally wrong!!! This is an awesome cd...one of the best I've ever heard. You have to be able to appreciate their different style to truely enjoy their songs. I don't even truely think of them as songs, I think of them more as poems to music...each one tells a different story. That's mah input!!! I like track 7 the best myself...it's very unique!!! To all you TRUE Linkin Park Fans...buy it...listen to it...love it!!! Lata!!!
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park is true rap/metal not like other bands that can't hardly rap or scream at the same time....
0441172717|5.0|In the very far future, the Atreides and the Harkonnen families are reaching the peak of their unending feud. When the Padishah Emperor - the ruler of all the known worlds - discovers that the Atreides army is becoming dangerously strong, he develops a complex frame-up to wipe-out the whole Atreides family. The Duke of Atreides is invited to accept the job of administering the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune. On this desolate, almost uninhabitable planet only one thing is of value: the spice Melange, a drug that makes space travel possible. At first this seems to be a fabulous gift, but soon the Duke suspects the true reason for the Emperor's generosity: with the help of the unbeatable army of the Emperor the Harkonnen family attack the planet Dune. All seems lost for the Atreides, but there is still hope: Paul Atreides, the Duke's son, has more power than seems feasible at first sight.<br />Dune is consistently voted the Number One science fiction book of the century by readers all over the world. Overrated? Reason enough to give it a try - I thought - so I embarked on this epic voyage to the planet Dune, although packed with quite a lot of scepticism. But surprisingly, I didn't regret my decision for a single moment: this is truly a Classic Masterpiece. The narrative of Frank Herbert is simply addictive; his insight into the fantastic gives evidence of pure mastery. The images used to describe the planet of Arrakis are overwhelmingly strong. The human struggle for survival in the most relentless conditions imaginable is so intensely portrayed that the planet itself becomes one of the major villains of the book. Nevertheless, Frank Herbert writes with such involvement that there is no doubt as to the reasons people might have for living in such conditions. High drama and complex plots, filled with treachery within treachery, makes this book an experience you never to forget.<br />A must read for everyone interested in fantasy and science fiction.
B00008H2LB|5.0|true rap/metal...LP lives up to our expectations...mines...don't know about the other fans...but excellent sophmore album...keep it up Linkin Park...
B00005JKJA|5.0|This movie is unlike any other movie I've ever seen in my life.<br />After watching it, I knew I had to review it, however, I was not entirely certain how I could do it, or what I would write. I could reveal every scene in the movie for this review and would still not tell you anything about the movie. I watched every single moment of the movie with a level of attentiveness I don't ever give films, and in spite of this, I could not tell you what the movie is about--I would be hard pressed to even tell what I think it's about.<br />The movie mostly revolves around two characters in Los Angeles--Rita (Laura Elena Harring) and Betty (Naomi Watts). Rita, we learn, has suffered amnesia from a car accident; she can recollect nothing about herself, not even her real name--she merely lifted the name 'Rita' from a Rita Hayworth movie poster in Betty's apartment. Her only belongings are a purse which contains a large sum of money, and a curious-looking blue key. Betty, an aspiring actress, has flown in from Ontario to audition for a part in a new movie directed by a man named Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux). Adam is involved the the movie's B-plot, where he must cast a particular actress for the movie's lead or be killed.<br />Once again, the movie is not really about that, or about anything. The movie can only be described as what it most closely resembles; it has been billed as a mystery, and that is true inasmuch as that there are things that are not known when the movie begins, but the movie is in a state of constant revelation. Resolution is never reached, but the mystery that requires it may never have existed to begin with.<br />I mentioned how much I was paying attention in this movie. I've never watched a movie before and been so completely drawn in by what was happening. I had no idea what to expect, ever, and I believe it will be a long time before I see a movie again that has that kind of power.<br />The movie does an out-of-nowhere turn in which everything that camebefore is rendered completely worthless in terms of plot development, spurned by Rita and Betty's discovery of what the little blue key goes to. Watts and Harring are in the movie after this point, but seemingly are now different characters. Or is the quartet of characters played by the two actresses all the same character? Nothing is for certain.<br />I watched the movie with two of my friends, Justin, who owned the DVD, and Josh, who was watching it for the first time like I was. Justin and I had come up with explanations for what was actually going on in the movie. Justin said that the last half-hour was the reality of Naomi Watts' character; everything before was her dream. I said that the entire movie was a death fantasy of a character who commits suicide at the very end of the movie. (I will not reveal who, though even if I did, nothing would be spoiled.) Both theories seem to hold water, but that is because everything in the movie to support plot is so scant that it is up to heavy interpretation. In the end I had to say that making sense of the movie was foolish, this movie only makes sense a scene at a time, and to tie them together will leave you with more loose ends than knots.<br />This is not a movie to see if you are concerned with making sense, this is a movie that is more concerned with feelings and emotions, requiring the audience to admit that they can't know what's going on.
B00005JKES|4.0|David Lynch's TV series Twin Peaks, still followed religiously  by hordes of well-meaning but overly obsessive geek fans, was a singular moment in television creativity.  With the bottom-line now the only consideration network execs have as to the production of a series, the creative and financial control that was given to Lynch and the series' writer, Mark Frost, is likely never to be seen again.  So if you're a fan of convoluted and enigmatic storylines (one of the few constants of Lynch's works) that require an almost singular dedication to understand, then you've found your set.  And a note to the nerds: Lynch doesn't grant interviews for a reason.  He doesn't think his work should be analyzed in the manner you people have been doing for the past 13 years!  Your personal interpretation is the right one, so quit with all the damn theories.
B00006F83Y|4.0|Look at first I would've given this album 2 stars only on the account of NO ONE KNOWS being the best song on the CD.  Well as time grew on I started getting into this compact disc.  Which stand out songs include FIRST IT GIVETH, A SONG FOR THE DEAD, THE SKY IS FALLIN, GO WITH THE FLOW, &amp; OF COURSE NO ONE KNOWS.  This is a great compact disc.  You may not like it at first but as time grows on you'll think it's a great CD.  This could be one of the best albums of 2,002.....
B00004XONN|3.0|Ok Computer was the first album I heard by Radiohead. I thought it was great.  I had heard a little about Kid A and thought I would like it because I am also a fan of electronic music.  I just finished listening to it for the first time and I really dont like it that much.  The melodies arn't very interesting and it isn't as emotional as OK  Computer. I thought it was boring.
B000083E79|1.0|Great, more money for Cher so she can &quot;plastic&quot; herself into eternal youth. There are a few decent songs on here but do we really need &quot;essential&quot; tracks like &quot;The Shoop Shoop Song&quot;(track 13) or &quot;Bang Bang&quot; (track 15)? One reviewer suggested that Cher be inducted to the rock and roll hall of fame. Does she even write her own music? The hall should be reserved for truly talented songwriters and performers. In my opinion Cher has never advanced to a level beyond her own shallow preocupations.

B00005JLEX|5.0|Why is Seinfeld not a DVD yet. I have seen shows that aren't even worthy to air on the same day as a repeat of Seinfeld, being released, (i.e. Malcom in the Middle, Friends, Family Guy). Seinfeld has never steered anyone wrong before, every episode is filled with witty qoutes that you know you are using the next day at school, work, church etc. Seinfeld is one of the few shows that doesn't rely on cameo appearances by celebrities to boost ratings, it would rather make up its own characters, (i.e. the Soup Nazi, Poppi, Mulva, Bubble Boy etc.) So Jerry if you want the money to buy yourself another Porsche with, give the word to release the show because SEAN IS GETTING ANGRY!
B00004WGAI|5.0|JANE EYRE shares the place in my heart with PRIDE AND PREJUDICE for my favorite novel.  Therefore, after seeing ALL the versions there are to see that I am aware of, I can say without flinching that this is the ONLY version that tries to incorporate ALL the important elements of the novel AS WRITTEN into a film version, and which keeps faithfully to the characterizations and DIALOGUE of the novel without trying to \\"modernize\\" or \\"improve\\" on the original as the A and E travesty with Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton did - though those actors did well with the material they had to work with.<BR> This version faithfully shows ALL three important sections of the novel, from the childhood with Jane's evil but wealthy three cousins where she is the poor relation before being sent off to the Puritanical Lowood Institution (and her time at Lowood included in this third), her life and love at Thornfield with Rochester, and her journey into the wild where she is saved from death by starvation and exhaustion by her poor yet loving and good-hearted cousins in the north.  And when Jane becomes a rich woman due to her childless uncle's inheritance, she equitably shares the wealth with her poor relations who have given her the love she has desperately wanted all her life from a blood relation.<BR>Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton and all the other principals in this version have done their homework in their performances and truly bring the characters of the novel to life without trying to improve on Bronte's descriptions - which is a difficult thing to do, and a tribute to their abilities as artists.  Dalton's beautiful bass/baritone speaking voice also embodies the 'sound' one expects to hear when reading Rochester's lines in the book as he is described.  The only drawback in ALL film versions of JANE which I have seen is that NONE that I know of show a Rochester with a fine singing baritone doing duets with Blanche Ingram, as he is described in the book, or the love of Jane's minister cousin for the local beauty in the north, and how he denies himself the real love he feels for this girl (which Jane is totally aware of and observes) while convincing himself of the \\"suitability\\" of Jane as a wife.  This is a very important element in the book - the whole moral and intellectual vs. passion levels of love.  BUT other than THAT - this version is the most faithful.  <BR>For Jane fans, I would recommend this one first...
B00008973A|1.0|This movie is unfortunate, because it ignores the elements that made the stage version so intense without replacing with anything else.<br />The stage version of the show runs in real-time. You watch the singers/dancers do the first number, after which they go through an initial cut down to \\"the line\\" of hopefuls, and then watch as each presents himself/herself to the casting director. The intensity of the stage show is that those folks on stage remain there, leaving once or twice, but largely, they stare back at you and don't leave.  You stare at them, and it gets scary. Just like an audition.<br />The movie tries to \\"open it up\\" by messing around with the pacing and timelines. There are flashbacks, people arrive at different points into the audition, there is footage included from outside the theater. Worse, the concept of \\"the line, no stars\\" from the show is lost in a poor subplot involving the director and one older dancer. (Yes, in the stage version that subplot's there. It's not the focus of the show, however, and the single top-10 song from the show, \\"What I Did For Love\\", is stolen from its focus about the love of dance/art and used in this wretched context instead.)<br />Do not see this movie before seeing the stage show.<br />It's considered, by Broadway types, to be the worse movie adaptation of a Broadway show that's been done. (Oliver and Chicago are the opposites, both adapting the shows excellently without being a simple film of a stage production.)
B000002LGA|5.0|Lou Reed's &quot;New York&quot; is a true masterpiece, one of those rare albums that it can be truly said belongs in any serious music-lover's collection.  An often brutal, often humorous look at Reed's hometown in the late 80's, &quot;New York&quot; is Lou's frank view of the social, economic, political, and even environmental currents of the time.  From start to finish, Lou takes you on his own twisted tour of the city, and it's one hell of a ride.  In the mid-90's indie film &quot;Blue in the Face,&quot; Lou muses, &quot;New York doesn't scare me...I get scared in places like Sweden.&quot;  Upon hearing this album, one realizes the true hilarity, and honesty, of those words.
B00008MNYS|5.0|Yes, his ego is as big as the States itself. Yes, he is a true exhibitionist. But, he also creates some of the best pop music in the industry today. ESCAPOLOGY just might be Robbie's ticket to fame in the U.S. The album already seems to be doing quite well here, despite no appearance on the singles chart. 'FEEL' 'HANDSOME MAN' 'COME UNDONE' and 'SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL' are just feel good songs that remind us about what excellent pop music is really all about. British critics may not always be kind to Robbie, but North Americans are really starting to appreciate him. For all of his American fans, Robbie will embark on an extensive North American tour starting in September 2003. Could this really be Robbie's time in the States? I seem to think so (as long as he can keep his clothes on long enough). For further listening pleasure, check out these other great UK acts: ATOMIC KITTEN, BLUE, SUGABABES and MIS-TEEQ. Also, check out KYLIE MINOGUE's sister DANNII (she's excellent as well), HOLLY VALANCE, and DELTA GOODREM (from Australia).
B00004S35Z|5.0|I don't have anything to say in terms of the musical content of this album that hasn't already been stated below -- it's a splendid work.  I do, however, want to chime in on the remastered disc in case you own the original CD and are wondering if it's worth shelling out the cash for yet another version.  In short: it's definitely worth it.  I'm usually underwhelmed by remasterings, but in the case of this album, remastering was long overdue.  The original CD sounded flat and muffled.  The remastered version is a major improvement -- it's nicely balanced and brings out all sorts of rich musical detail lost in the mush of the first CD pressing.
B000007T1M|5.0|This album is unbelievable. I own no other like it. Not even SOAD themselves have released an album that sounds like this. Serj shrieks and roars, and the instrumentals, especially the guitars, go along perfectly with him. But it's not ... like metal bands such as Mudvayne and Slipknot. The scope of variety on this album is enormous, and the style is totally unique. I'd highly recommend this album to anyone who likes hard rock or metal. Here are some notable songs.<br />3.Sugar-SOAD's first radio release, which is odd because this is one of the weirder songs on a weird enough album. The video is awesome for this one.<br />4.Suggestions - How does a man make his voice that high?<br />5.Spiders- The softest song on the album and the band's second release. Very much like Aerials, on Toxicity.<br />8.War?- It's amazing they never released this one to radio. This song kicks ..., and is strange to listen to now that we are no longer in peacetime. You'll see what I mean.<br />9.Mind-This song is literally like a nightmare!At 6:09, it is by far the longest song on this album, and you be the judge of whether that's a good thing or not. It's one of my favorites, for sure. The funny thing is, I didn't even know this song existed until about a week ago, and I've had this album since August! The reason is, the beginning is so slow you just want to skip to the next song, which I did, every time. Finally I waited, and found out the tempo DEFINETLY picks up. A lot.<br />10. Peephole- This song reminds me of an evil circus.<br />12. Darts- Another cool song. I love the clock in the background.<br />I mentioned that \\"Mind\\" was like a nightmare, and really all the songs are like dreams in audio form. A must buy.
B00007E8V4|5.0|The best album I've ever heard, I can listen to this on repeat not skipping a single song, it's just the BEST.<br />My favorite songs:<br />1. Streamline - This song is so amazing; best ending ever 11/10<br />2. Boom! - Right up there with Streamline 11/10<br />3. ADD - Same as above 11/10<br />4. Chic N' Stu - Funny; Love it! 10/10<br />5. Roulette - VERY nice, but not very much lyrics 9/10<br />6. Mr. Jack - Love this song; greatest riff ever 11/10<br />7. Highway Song - Very nice; takes some time to like it 10/10<br />8. Ego Brain - This is pretty good; Good lyrics 9/10<br />9. Bubbles - Very nice; 8/10<br />10. Nu Guns - When they say \\"Nu Guns\\" thats the best 10/10<br />11. Pictures - I love the repeat lyrics 10/10<br />12. 36 - OK, very short though 8/10<br />13. F*** the System - Exactly how I'd say it 10/10<br />14. Innervision - Very good 10/10<br />15. IEAIAEO - Very fast and good touch to it 11/10
2246269318|5.0|This book changed my life.  I never thought a book would change my life; indeed, before I never enen thought much of books, but this book even changed my thinking that I wouldn't be changed by it.  <br />In my eyes, catch-22 is not about anything. Joseph Heller will never tell you \\"War is bad, say no to war\\" and force you to believe it.  What he does is create situations in which many aspects of human life are illustrated, and he lets you make of it what you will.  And while he's at it, he makes the book tragic, funny, and unbelievably touching all at the same time.<br />I will never dictate to anyone what to get out of Catch-22, but what it meant most to me was the idiocy and self-ruin of human society.  It's the stupidity of putting man-made notions and concepts ahead of people themselves.  This can be anything from comical to absolutely horrifying.  It's funny when the doctors at Yossarian's hospital have no choice but to keep him there because his liver is not bad enough to require operation but not bad enough that they can declare him safe to leave the hospital.  But it makes you think twice about society, the world, and humanity when a young soldier in Yossarian's plane gets hit and bleeds to death, and the madness of war is coupled with the absurdity of Milo taking out parts of the first aid kit to make ice cream soda for the benefit of the same people who were fighting for causes they really were not sure of.<br />All in all, it's futile to explain catch-22 because you can only experience it by reading it.  Joseph Heller passed away a few years ago, but Yossarian will never die.
B000002KFJ|4.0|This is one of my favorite Black Sabbath albums. Each song is interesting like the rocking opener &quot;Hole in the Sky&quot;, the epic &quot;Meglomania&quot;, and the synth-like &quot;Am I Going Insane (Radio)&quot;. &quot;Thrill of it All&quot; is my favorite song on the album. What keeps it from perfection, though, is that it's not as hard rocking as their second album, Paranoid. It's a more artier album. Still, Sabotage is worthy of purchase.
0440236738|4.0|LIke many of you - I found this to be a great escape - but falling second to Tell No One.  I loved the twists and turns - and I could go with the ending - EXCEPT I am completely puzzled by the newspaper article . .clues???  I have passed the book along so I can't keep searching - but I must say, the book stuck with me enough that I keep puzzling over that article??
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Judging from some of the reviews here,  there is little appeciation for what James Marshall Hendrix was or too many bad drugs.  Clapton was in awe of Hendrix and Pagey could never begin to even comprehend what Hendrix was doing to be in awe of it. <br />Like some of the Led Zepplin compliations,  this is a very good place to learn about Hendrix and his music.  Often it is forgotten that there were only three real albums released in three years.  There is no other artist who has had such a huge impact with such a short discography.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|This is a well put together set of cds that allows new listeners an opportunity to acquire a best of collection. I grew up on Rumours and the music remains with staying power decades later. Their new cd is due April 15/2003 and I am fortunate to have a copy of both Peacekeeper and a live version of the same. If the remainder of the cd is anything like this single, fans will be the big winners here. Additionally, this new disk shows the influence of 9/11
0446310786|4.0|'To Kill a Mockingbird' is a excellent novel that relates the story of an ordinary child's life in extraordinary circumstances.  Harper Lee uses strong emotion, laughter, and reason to relate a time of controversy and \\"the crisis of conscience\\".  This story is told from the perspective of a young girl named Jean Louise, nicknamed Scout.  She lives with her older brother Jem and is raised by her single father, which relates to her less than typical upbringing.  <BR>        The main focus point of this story relates to a case that Scout's father agrees to take.  It is a case that is surrounded by controversy.  A black man is accused of assaulting a white woman, and in this time frame, a white person is not to be disputed by a black person.  Atticus, Scout and Jem's father, believes that he has no choice but to take the case and he must struggle with the town that he lives in to do what he knows that he must do.  This also has a strong affect on Scout and Jem's life.  I would strongly encourage anyone to read this book and learn how Atticus, Scout, and Jem handle the town's reactions and to learn the outcome of the case.<BR>      This novel tells a story filled with humor and excite, sadness and emotional conflict.  This novel is especially good for young adult readers, because the story is related from their viewpoint.  This is a novel that you can sit down and enjoy, but also take away a good life lesson from it.
B00003CXFV|2.0|I didn't have much of an opinion after watching this movie. It followed a cookie cutter formula of good v. bad and of good going through tough times but triumphing.<br />...that is until Roberts got the Academy Award.<br />I've developed an unsophisticated,unscientific and frankly childish opinion: This movie ... Again, I am rating this against the background of extradinorary elite recipients of oscars. Giving Roberts a best actress award is akin to a booger on your Picasso. <br />Perhaps its just been a long winter here, and I'm in a mean mood. To be a bit fair, this flick will do as a snowy/rainy day afternoon.
B000063S6Z|4.0|To say that 18 is a departure from the feel-good tunes that clogged Play is merely stating the obvious. We Are All Made of Stars and A Jam for the Ladies seem to merely take up space in the album, very heterogeneous from the other more somber tracks. It took me a few listens through to realize how deep and emotional this album is, if lacking obvious masterpieces like Play's Porcelain. A must have for Moby fans, and for those who enjoy a soul-searching record.
B00004STPT|5.0|Hans Zimmer did a brilliant job to bring together the best for this amazing film, still since 2000 it has been one of my favorite albums. It has everything, African drums, Enya's spiritual words, orchestra's best ect. ect. I just have to say WOW!
B00005V3Z4|1.0|I couldn't wait for this film to finish.  Imagine comparing this film to Stir of Echoes.  Not even in the same league.  Don't spend a lot of money on it.
B000002GQH|5.0|As I read some of the reviews of this album, I am so pleased to see many were written by young people. I think that's GREAT!! To those of us who fell in love with this band, we have had this album ingrained in our soul for many years. It's a part of us. From beginning to end, this album is pure art! And if you don't have it yet, you need to get it. This album is one of my 5 favorites. And it is a {{{{BLAST}}}} to play. Even the laid-back 'Lazy day, sunday afternoon' is a joy. 'Are You Sitting Comfortably' is a good example how Hayward can take a real simple chord progression and using a thumb pick (how guitar players use flat picks and thereby putting between 1 and 3 fingers outta commission I will never understand), use a break time melody and then a downscale riff and actually make it WORK! So easy, yet soooooooo classy. It starts with a hammer-on single lower E, then to G with a C and D note hammer-on and then a Dm and single E hammer-on, then a progression C chord, down scale to B (actually just a B 5th string and D 2nd string..D and G strings are played open and both E strings are silent), B flat, Am, G (sorry if I lost you). If you do that, you will understand what I mean. 'Never Comes A Day' showcases the fullness of the band's sound and how they were MASTERS of studio technology...YEARS before Floyd and Rush expanded on it. Oh BABY...What an album!
B00008LOS1|4.0|The 1971 release of Who's Next ranks as one of the best classic rock albums of all time. The albums original nine tracks were initially going to be released with additional songs that were to make it a two album set. Following the release of the two album Tommy, it was decided that a single album would have a greater impact. Some of the additional songs deleted from the original album have crept out in other forms as sigles, b-sides and on 1974's Odds &amp; Sods. <br />Thirty years later, there has still been no effort to compile and release the original double album, so Who's Next tracks spill out over a variety of material (greatest hits albums, Odds &amp; Sods, Who's Missing, &amp; Two's Missing). My biggest flaw with the Delux addition of Who's Next is that MCA still has yet to add hit songs from the Who's Next sessions on any version of the album. Songs left off the album are Let's See Action, The Relay, Join Together, Time is Passing, Too Much of Anything, and a few others. On a two disk set, this feat would have been easy to pull off but was never attempted for some reason. Personally, I would rather here different songs on an album than hear different versions of the same song. <br />With that gripe aside, the sound quality is superb as well as the packaging. There is a longer version of Baby Don't You Do It, the Odds &amp; Sods version of Love Ain't for Keeping, and disk 2 features live performances from the Young Vic shows in 1971. The Young Vic performances being the only real reason for upgrading from your remastered version of Who's Next.
B000002H33|5.0|In reading all of the  reviews of this album, one thing comes to mind, everybody has a different opinion about it. Let me say one thing, i've been listening to this type of music for twenty years, and in all that time, there has only been a few records that you could truely say were masterpieces. When i first heard this record, way back in March of 86',  i was completely blown away. Not a bad song on it. I know some people have said that Leper Messiah is a kind of weak song, but i think it fits in quite nicely. i am especially fond of this one for one simple fact, that this the last recording with Cliff Burton. I was lucky enough to have seen him &quot;live&quot;, six months before he died. Blew Ozzy right off the stage! But back to the review. Every song on this record is played with intensity and power. Maybe even some passion. Something they have seemed to lost over the years. Is this my favorite album from them? No, that would be Kill'em all &amp; The 5.98 EP. But this is probably the best record the have done to date. Everything came together on this baby, the playing, song writing, and the sound. Ahh, the sound, another job well done by Fleming Rasmussen. if you think i'm kidding check out Morbid Angel's &quot;Covenent&quot;, you'll see what i mean. Well anyway, you can't go wrong with any of their records, but if i were to get just one, this would be it. This just maybe one of  the best ever...
0312106122|5.0|First of all, i must emphasize:<br />THIS IS NOT HISTORICALLY ACCURATE FICTION.<br />Once you come to grips with that, you can accept it as intriguing, and occasionally, romantic fiction.  Sure, the technology isn't completely accurate and the characters didn't really exist, but that's what makes it fiction.<br />Taita's genius and perfection do get somewhat annoying, and sometimes the plot seems somewhat farfetched, but all in all this is an entertaining read.<br />Read if you: enjoy the setting of ancient Egypt, like a little romance mixed with historical fiction, like a good adventure<br />Don't read if you:  are an Egypt history buff, like pure fiction w/o romance, need completely feasible details.
0385504209|5.0|I have read much historical fiction/suspense, and this is certainly one of my \\"top five\\".  The clues, puzzles, double-entendres, and anagrams are brilliant.  The story grabs hold immediately and does not let go of the reader...I did not put the book down until I was finished, and was disappointed that the experience was over.  The Da Vinci Code is comparable to The Name of the Rose, An Instance of the Fingerpost, and other highly literate compositions.  It is clever, entertaining, and captivating... It is guaranteed to thrill.
B00005JLRR|5.0|Apparently the final film in the long-running STAR TREK film series, NEMESIS is simply the best of the franchise. It also works as a marker to show how far the films have come since the first snooze-fest STAR TREK. Stuart Baird's direction makes this one a tautly-paced, exciting adventure with fantastic special effects and a great score from Trek veteran Jerry Goldsmith. Both Patrick Stewart as Picard and Jonathan Frakes as William Riker turn out great peformances, and the added gravitas fills the void left by previous Trek movies. There are some complaints; the middle section tends to drag on for a while and the cop-out ending seems to contradict the well-known publicity about this one being the last. But this is minor carping, as the film as a whole is great fun.
B000002J1H|5.0|This is the Progressive Rock masterpiece of our generation and most likely for generations to come. Jon Anderson even says this is the bands best work. As a Yes fan for 25 years, this is the one record I can and will never get tired of. It just keeps getting better, almost like some sort of spiritual or religious experience. Turn Of The Century is a reflection of the history of art, humanity and all things beautiful in this world. When I have had a hard day, one listen to this CD and I am renewed again. The strange power this CD has over me has been going on for 25 years now! Many other Yes fans I have met share this feeling. Thanks Jon, Rick, Alan, Steve and Chris for proving how good life can be!
B00005RY7X|5.0|Andrew WK is a mix of:<BR>hair metal: a lot of 80's like guitar riffs, but not really any solos.<BR>new-wave: all the keyboards and pianos.<BR>hardcore punk: the way he sings, shouts, chants, and screams. some will aruge with this, they are wrong.<BR>techno: sometimes a techno beat is thrown in there every once in a while.<BR>party: non stop.<BR>&quot;she is beautiful&quot; probaly has the best guitar riff, listen to the intro riff once the music kicks in. &quot;i get wet&quot; is definitly an adrenaline pumper. i love this album. if you don't like it, then you don't get it. it's supposed to be fun. let loose, and just dance to this album.
B000069AUI|5.0|Yes they sounds closely to U2, Radiohead, and The beatles. But the guth is this band has blended their influences and has created an album of true beauty and despair. I listened to Carachutes which was the first album i bought in over five years where i loved every single track. But on this album i think that all of the songs are great. Especially 3 \\"God Put a Smile on Your Face\\",4 Scientist ,5 Clocks, 6 Daylight , 7 GReen Eyes ,8A Warning Sign. If these were on an album and the rest fo the albu, [wasn't that good] but they were on it i would buy the album for just those songs. Now the other songs are good Amsterdam is actually another song where i would buy the album for just that song. But the only song i didnt care for really was A whisper but it was still more inspired than most of the music out these days. I think this will be the next great band because in only two albums they have made music that took alot of modern bands four or five albums to get, and that is you dont have to be loud to be powerful, lyrics are important, and the only time you should blend music is if it is natural.
B00008H2LE|5.0|What can I say? This album will likely to make it very very big impact this year... more than the Hybrid Theory has accomplished. if you have their Hybrid Theory album, you will surely enjoy this one.
B00003CXP1|5.0|This film portrays various drug addictions in all their glory.  From the hardest hardcore drugs to seemingly innocuous prescription addictions, each character starts off slowly and we get to watch as their lifes spin farther and farther out of their control.  A voyeuristic view into the world of addiction that leaves you both fascinated and shocked.  It uses a raw film style and doesn't pull punches, definitely not for the squeamish.  The ending doesn't tie neatly up into a bow in the Hollywood feel-good style (Traffic) but some characters suffer more than others, and none escape the movie unscathed.<br />  Opinion wise, I don't give out too many 5 star ratings, this one earned it. This movie didn't make it into a lot of Cineplex 24's but found it's place in the \\"art house\\" type theaters.  It is an excellent movie but it's grim and somewhat harsh portrayal of the effect of drugs on these people makes it one you have to go in prepared for. If your list of \\"great\\" films includes anything with Vin Diesel, please move on, this isn't for you.  If you are a male who wears a beret, this doesn't have subtitles, move on.  Anyone with a bit of refinement, who likes indy-looking film and doesn't mind getting some rough treatment at the hands of a director without the Hollywood sugar-coat, take a look at this, I think you'll find it a winner too.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|I would say it's more like 3.5 stars.  This is an overall good movie, it has some great special effects and an interesting story.  I was hoping that it would be as good as movies like The Mummy or Jurassic Park because I like these type of movies, but it lacks something compared to them.  It lacks some more action and some \\"major\\" event of some sort.  Also it doesn't feel as a big adventure like the other 2, it has a smaller feel to it.  They should have added an extra half hour.  By the way, I've never read the book or seen the original, and basically I don't care about watching a movie from 50 years ago.  Anyways, it's a nice little movie and if you enjoy adventure, special effects and science fiction, then you will have a good time.   It could have been better, but it's still good.  3.5/5
B00005JLEU|5.0|I really didn't want to see this movie at first, but I forced to as it was my brother's birthday, and he is an animation fanatic. <br />Even though I'm fifteen and like to think of myself as above cartoon movies, this has quickly turned into one of my favorite movies, prompting a fifth visit to my local theater to see it. Everytime I see it, I notice something different about it, that I didn't before.<br />It has a fantastic plot, and really transports you to a different world where not everything is as it seems on the surface. It really absorbs you. There are sad parts, and well as funny parts, and you feel the emotions of the charachters.<br />Despite the PG rating, this movie may scare little kids, as there is some pretty weird stuff going on in the movie, such as people beng transformed into pigs, several monsters, dragons, and some animated blood.<br />This is definitely one of the most enjoyable movies I have seen in a really long time.
B00006JU7T|4.0|For many viewers of my generation, the definitive Al Pacino performance is the Cuban drug lord Tony Montana in Brian DePalma's 1983 \\"Scarface\\" (\\"Say 'allo to muh lil' friend!\\").  But for me, the cream of Pacino's crop was in the 1970s, and among his great performances in that decade was in the 1973 movie \\"Serpico.\\"  In this feature directed by Sidney Lumet (who also directed another Pacino film, 1975's \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\"), Al plays a cop who joins the force with the best of intentions.  He's honest, sincere, and treats criminal suspects impartially--qualities that should enable an officer to advance in his field.  Instead, Frank's kindness and humanity make him an object of scorn and contempt among his peers, who engage in shady dealings and suspicious activity.  Frank's job ultimately takes a toll on his life, both professionally and romantically, and by the end of the movie, he's transformed from an eager-to-please cop to a jaded officer.  The movie is an effective and scathing commentary on police corruption, and it earned Pacino his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor (he was previously nominated for Best Supporting Actor for 1972's \\"The Godfather\\").  The DVD offers a decent picture and surround sound for a movie of this age, and the extras include retrospective interviews with the filmmakers.  I was disappointed that Pacino isn't featured in any of these interviews, but aside from that, I thought they were overall informative.  I'd hesitate to call \\"Serpico\\" a classic, but it's a fine and gritty drama that has an award-calibre performance by Pacino.
0783225970|1.0|Those who say Scarface is one of the greatest gangster films of all time, obviously has not spent the time to watch more than this one. I curse those who place Scarface in the same sentence, nevermind level, as such masterpieces as the Godfather (parts 1 and 2), Goodfellas and even Casino. Al Pacino gives a painful performance in a movie that was a mistake to make. If viewers would like to see Pacino at his best, see movies such as Serpico or the Godfather, but please, I beg you, skip on this. The story is simple and makes you feel stupid after watching. Basically the plot of the movie is this: guys die, Pacino screams his lines, tons of drugs are done and Pacino kills his enemies. My bad for ruining the end of the film to those who are not smart enough to figure it out. <br />When watching this movie, I wanted to cry. Not as a result of the drama of the film (if you want to call the poor acting, directing and writing loosely thrown together dramatic), but because I had taken time out of my life to watch the movie, time I will never ever get back. Al Pacino should have known better when reading this poor script (he also should have taken speech class to develope a reasonable accent). Those of you still contemplating the purchase of this film, I sure hope you do not like good movies or have the ability to live forever or are extremely rich, because if you are not, you will find yourself wanting the time and money you have spent watching this sorry movie back to do anything else. I can best some up this movie in one word; [sad]...
B00005JKPF|5.0|I have read the book for this movie, and it was fantastic. And, since the book is pretty much the movie, I know that it wont suck. In fact, it looks like X-Men 2 will be a lot better than the first. More action, more Iceman, and more Storm. That's what I'm looking forward too. The trailers look amazing, and the scenes I've seen so far are wonderful. I can't wait to see this on the big screen, and this will defianitly be the best movie from Marvel comics.
0783225725|5.0|In this classic western, Clint Eastwood performs admirably as producer, director and of course starring in the lead role.  High Plains Drifter is an excellent tale that highlights Eastwood's talents in this genre, whether it's his \\"Stranger\\" type aura or the clipped but poignant lines.  This great western has a superb script and exceptional performances by Eastwood and the other actors.  Its surreal style, unexpected plot twists and great camera angles serve well to enhance this movies overall appearance.  I do not normally comment on the soundtrack for films however, in this case I feel compelled to because I felt the soundtrack for this one is a perfect accoutrement to the overall feel of the movie!<br />The premise:<br />A lone stranger rides into town and is immediately set upon by some of the locals.  Unfortunately for these rough locals, they've picked the star of the movie in Clint Eastwood to aggravate and they receive his quick six shooter justice for their efforts.  The locals, being a cowardly bunch, eagerly set out to appease him in every way in order to secure his loyalty and protection from a group of criminals who are soon to be released from the territorial prison.<br />The \\"Stranger\\" agrees to be their benefactor and immediately sets out to do so in some strange ways.  Through humiliation, misogyny and the threat of immediate \\"justice,\\" he begins to prepare the town for return of the criminals.  As a surreal side note, the Stranger and some of the locals are having waking nightmares about the brutal killing of the former marshal by the criminals who are expected to return.  What follows is a western that is one of the best and a benchmark for all westerns to follow.<br />I highly recommend this great Eastwood western to any and all die hard or casual fans of the genre or the actor.  It is a classic western that deserves a spot on the DVD rack.<br />Special features:<br />Not unlike many of the other movies of the time, this one isn't jam packed withspecial features because there just aren't many to throw in.  It does have a great trailer and some production notes that are quite interesting to read through on the screen.  {ssintrepid}
B00008BXJF|1.0|The Power to Believe is even worse than The ConstruKction of Light (if that is possible.) It's hard to understand why these masterful (Mastelotto excluded) and experienced musicians are doing this \\"heavy metal\\" thing (and they are calling it \\"moving forward\\"!) The new instrumental pieces are boring to death. They lack in dynamics, are exaggerated and, like Dangerous Curves, go from nowhere to anywhere. Level Five sounds like it was part of Larks IV (which was a failure too.) And they get even worse if you compare then with King Crimson's past achievements. King Crimson's hardcore fans don't like to hear it (they consider it a \\"dead thread\\"), but the truth is that without the elegance of Levin and Bruford these guys completely lost their tracks and became a mere rock band trying to look Modern. For that matter, you just have to compare the musical excellence of the Projekct One album (Fripp, Gunn, Levin and Bruford) and the BLUE albums (Bruford, Levin, Torn and Botti) with those horrible and pointless eletronic sounds of Projekct Three and Four (Projekt Two is ok.) The Double Trio band was a very interesting and relevant endevour. Even when they appeared to be reworking the past, like in VROOOM, they sounded fresh and focused. The THRAK album deserve to be put side by side with In The Court of Crimson King, Larks Tongues in Aspic, Red and Discipline. Now, the best thing that the new King Crimson quartet have done in years is Heaven and Earth (that instrumental bonus track at the end of TCoL album.) I wish then good luck with their new tour. Maybe they will get new adolescent fans that will jump all-around. Nevertheless, those looking for intelligent and inspiring music should go elsewhere.<br />P.S.: In order to make my review more helpful to others, I have to say that I'm not a rock (or even \\"prog\\" rock) music listener. I just happen to like SOME of King Crimson's music. So if you just happen to be a fan of plain and unimaginative rock music go for The Power to Believe.
B000070WJE|5.0|I couldn't wait 'til the release of this CD here in the US so I paid an import price as soon as I could! <BR>This is another EXCELLENT album no matter what his detractors might say. Here in America, we are so starved for originality, intelligence and, meaningfulness and most of us don't even know it. As good as this work is, it won't surprise me if it doesn't go over here. <BR>Although I'd like to see RW received as he should be here in the US., it would concern me that in attempts to do so his music genius might be manipulated and distorted in favor of commerce rather than art. Another cause of concern is his diminishing collaboration with Guy Chambers.<BR>To sum up this work, It is a wonderful and complex blend of musical styles which come together to create yet another RW masterpiece. Go buy this CD, this man has a beautiful soul which shines through in his voice and through the words he writes. Go buy this CD, I want him to build his mum that beautiful new house!
B00001QGIQ|4.0|My three year old loves this movie, and sings along with most of the songs.  The great songs and story aren't the only treasure within this movie though, we also find a wonderful moral lesson which isn't specific to any particular religion, but is common to all religious and moral principles.<br />Since Pinocchio was only born yesterday(pun intended) he's not versed in the ways of the world, so we get to see him fall into bad company when he doesn't listen to his consious, Jiminy Cricket.  What an excellent way to be able to bring up the subject of people out there who aren't all good and are out to only help themselves and let everyone else pay the consequences of thier actions!  Seeing this lesson twice repeated in the movie, first when Pinocchio is sold to Stromboli, and then again when he is tricked into going to pleasure iasle shows no good can come from listening to these kinds of users.<br />While some find the boys turning into donkeys to be disturbing, maybe a bit of disturbance at the consequences of doing the wrong thing isn't so bad?  When I saw it as a child I don't remember being terrified or getting nightmares, and my children seem to be fine after seeing this movie many times.<br />Pinocchio must also find courage, intelligence and perserverance to save Gepetto after he escapes with Jiminy's help.  The movie is really a hopefull message that even after someone has strayed off the 'right' path they can straighten things out again if they really work hard at it.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Linkin Park... a fine band, a talented outfit, whatever you call it these guys know what they do. Following up on Hybrid Theory, their 14 million selling masterpiece, LP have arranged a 13 track-albeit a 36 minute- sequel. It's nothing you haven't heard before. Basic song structures that we are all used to by now. Familiar song dynamics (exchanges between Mike Shinoda's rap and Chester Bennington's melodies). And lyrics of familiar nature. Yet Linkin Park has a gift. They know how to make this stuff tasteful and not overplayed. They know how to make good, catchy, honest music that is able to move the listener in every way. I believe that this album also displays a sort of transitional maturation. We are witnessing what will become of the next album. It will surely be more technical and complicated and hopefully at least half an hour longer. But I'm getting ahead of myself, the album's been out for 2 weeks. The highlights for me are &quot;Easier to Run, Breaking the Habit, Figure.09, Numb&quot; and &quot;Hit the Floor&quot;. I found the single &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; the only tired song on this selection.<br />Honestly, I was disappointed with the lack of duration. 36 minutes is just not enough. Especially with this band's talent and integrity. I know for a fact they can make incredible music. I HIGHLY recommend obtaining or downloading Linkin Park's music before they were called Linkin Park. Hybrid Theory was their original monicker and that stuff was amazing as well. All in all, I have faith in this band. I feel they are going to encounter a musical milestone. Do as you see fit. This album is just more good stuff, nothing more, nothing less. Enjoy
B00005JLKN|4.0|I had reservations when first deciding to watch this movie thinking it might be in the same league with \\"Hannibal\\" which I found disappointing.  Of course, it was pleasing to find that Red Dragon is quite a step above Hannibal and is well done.<br />Of all the Hannibal Lecter movies in the trilogy, Silence of the Lambs appears to be the benchmark by which all others are judged and for good reason, of course, due to it's enourmous success and excellent production.  Red Dragon comes in at a close second.<br />As for the first attempt above all others, Manhunter was a good shot in the dark to launch the whole series, and although not a bad movie really, Red Dragon gets the job done even better.  For diehard fans of Hannibal Lecter though, it is recommended that maybe you watch both Manhunter and Red Dragon as to draw your own conclusions of which will be your favorite.<br />The movie itself has a great cast with Ed Norton and Anthony Hopkins displaying good chemistry in their interactions.  Harvey Keitel is a decent choice for the FBI agent in charge and lastly, Ralph Fiennes does very well as the serial killer.  The plot moves at a credible pace throughout the movie and doesn't stagnate as in Hannibal.  Last but not least, the special features offered on the DVD are very good with Lecters FBI File (case history and criminal profile) being the best and most interesting of the features.<br />For all Hannibal fans, and even those with a casual interest in the trilogy, this movie is recommended to you and won't disappoint. Enjoy.
B00008H2LB|4.0|...just worn out. This album is good in it's own right, but it can't compare to what they did on Hybrid Theory. <br />An example is the first song (after the \\"coulda-been-attached-to-the-following-song-intro\\"), it sounds just like One Step Closer. Also, in their songs, they have more Reanimation elements in the songs (i.e, more mixing, dj scratches, etc) but i think it's for the better.<br />Bottom line: the album is good, but LP, please try something different next time.
B0000640VO|5.0|This quirky film won me over from its first moments showing the childhood of Amelie, an imaginative girl born of emotionally stunted parents. From her suicidal goldfish to her belief that her camera causes accidents to her sullen (and hilarious) revenge against her father, Amelie's childhood perfectly describes the rest of the film: both poignantly real and humorously surreal. As an adult, Amelie (Audrey Tautou) retains her impish nature while living in a circumscribed world. She works as a waitress in a caf&eacute;, lives alone in her Parisian flat, and spies on her neighbors. When she discovers by accident a small box hidden behind the tile of her bathroom, Amelie sets out to return it to its rightful owner. Because of the effect this return has, Amelie sets out to do good deeds aimed to change the lives of other people, ignoring the reality that her own life is desperately in need of love.<br />The plot by itself cannot adequately define this film. The wry voiceovers create a tone of humorous levity, and the cast of off-beat characters lend the feel of a small circus. Warmth and charm and wit abound. The remarkable performance of Audrey Tautou - honest and nuanced - brings the entire film into focus.<br />I waited far too long to see this film. I highly recommend it for a wide audience, from foreign film buffs to romantic comedy devotees to those looking for a funny, upbeat film to liven up the evening.
B00008MNYS|3.0|I found this cd a little short of pizzaz. It's style did remind me of Rod Stewart's latest effort in covering the standards, so can only say it is fairly pleasant. Sure was not as good as I would have hoped, but far better than Williams previous release here.<BR>A successful recent release by Michael Bubl may well have made Williams' entry into this market a little easier. And this IS a fair alternative to top 40 pop....
B00005J6SZ|5.0|Madonna was among the most successful pop singers of the eighties and nineties. Listening to this album, it's easy to see why, Four enormous international hits - Like a virgin, Angel, Material girl and Dress you up - plus an outstanding cover of Love don't live here anymore and some other great songs that would surely have been hits had they been released as singles - most notably Over and over, a catchy number to make you get up and dance to.<br />There were those who thought that Madonna was all about image, but this album made me realise that she had the talent as well. I am therefore not surprised that she has continued to make great music that sells in huge quantities.<br />My Like a virgin CD includes another major international hit, Into the groove, which has been omitted from this re-mastered version. A couple of re-mixes of other songs have been included instead. Even without Into the groove (which can be found elsewhere), this remains one of Madonna's strongest albums - and that is saying something, given the consistently high quality of all her albums.
0316666343|5.0|I'm suprised others didn't like this book, as I found it (as cliched as it might sound) one I literally couldn't put down.  In truth, I'm not sure whether I loved it or it was simply just compelling (which sounds redundant, I know) -- but I was riveted from the beginning.  I didn't initially want to read this, as I'd heard so much hype I couldn't believe it, but was in a situation where I needed something to read and happened to have just been lent the book.  Once I started, I didn't stop and read it one day.  Did I love it?  I'm really not sure, but I do know that it was incredibly gripping -- and would recommend it highly.
B00003CX95|5.0|I saw this movie more than two times before I bought it. First in the cinema, second in a PPV TV channel. Then I decided to buy it in purpose to keep it as one of my DVDs best collections.
B00000055E|4.0|First of all ive got to say that cd1 is'nt better than cd2.But overall this album is not that bad,not the best 2pac album of course for several reasons.It was released in 1997 but the songs are from 1994,some of the songs lacked what id expect of him.I liked do 4 luv and hellrazor,when i get free2,hold on and some others.But this album has some really good beats and tunes,get it but dont be to disa pointed about some of it.
B00007L4MJ|3.0|Let me start by saying that a movie of this stature can't be praised highly enough. Having said that I beg to differ with all the five star rave reviews concerning the DVD transfer. I'm quite the Metropolis fan and my toes curled when I saw that the newest and latest official release has its intertitles translated into English up to the point of actually changing the original images as well.(The address card Freder shows Josaphas, the Hel memorial plaque, the tower of Babel sequence, a business card picked up by Freder, etc, are all English translations inserted by digital or other means into the film.) So, claiming that this version is original is dubious to say the least. Why not benefit from DVD's technology to leave it up to the viewer to choose between the (original) German or English intertitles? If it can be done with subtitles, I'm sure intertitles can't pose a problem. Imagine the frustration of the German movie buffs who have to watch one of their greatest movies of all time with English intertitles and German subtitles! What really made me frown is that in the scene selection section on the DVD you can make out the original German intertitles in some of the preview windows! The frustrating part about this is that even when using DVD's technological advantages to choose between intertitles, changes made onto the print by substituting English text over the images are permanent.<br />Furthermore I challenge any film technician or any of the members on the restauration team of the Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Foundation to tell me that this version of Metropolis is transfered at the correct speed. And by that I mean the speed at which any normal human being walks, runs and can gesticulate without looking like an episode from Comedy Capers. Have a look at the final scene where Rotwang chases Maria up the Cathedral. It is actually comical and embarassing to see, taking into account the enormous effort the F.W.M. Foundation took in restoring this monument. Trust me,you don't have to be an animation student or an expert in locomotion to see that the actor's movements are sped up. Even the big clock's second hand in Frederson's office races by at exaggerated speed. When Joh Frederson stands opposite of Rotwang (Hal statue sequence), Rotwang waves his hands frenetically in Fredersen's face to gesticulate refusal. For a moment his hands elude me because of motional blur. Eureka's 1999 release of Metropolis had much better and natural movement of the actors. What very few people know is that Fritz Lang under-crancked the camera for some of the shots in his movie to add drama and weight to some scenes. These little moments of genius gave Metropolis some of its extraordinary atmosphere and appeal and are now completely lost with this release.<br />In 1927 the German production company UFA ordered the film to be cut for the US release. The American editor charged with this operation also exchanged the German intertitles and scenes with German texts for English substitutes. It's an irony that this release has been labeled &quot;Restored Authorized Edition&quot; for it perpetuates the act of defacing the original print as the editor did in 1927. The claim Kino makes this being a restored edition is at least misleading. Apart from footage that must be considered permanently lost, the claim holds no truth. The Merriam Webster dictionary defines &quot;restore&quot; as: &quot;To put or bring back into a former or original state.&quot; Metropolis is a German movie. It used German text and titles. So let's get over the five star rave and try to be at least a little critical. I mean we're talking about one of the most influential and monumental movies of all time. Too bad its fantastic restauration is marred by such obvious flaws.<br />My first copy of Metropolis was Eureka's 1999 release which runs at 139 minutes on region 2 equipment. Although the image suffers from a very bad transfer and even more missing footage in comparison with this release, it is so much more the viewing experience you want and ultimately can't forget. Speeding up a film destroys the director's artistical vision together with the movies ambience and atmosphere. Needless to say I immediately returned my recently acquired Restored Authorized Edition for a refund.
0316666343|2.0|We have such promise of a great story here; a murdered young girl tells us the story of her death and its aftermath, with backstory added at times. Altogether, the makings of a gripping novel. The beginning is powerful, and draws one into the story right away. Character development builds, and I thought, \\"Wow, this is really good stuff!\\" But perhaps about 2/3 of the way into the book, I started to feel the flaws. The actions of the mother and grandmother seemed out of place; they did not feel right. Ms. Sebold's take on the grandmother's drinking problem might have taken a more realistic path. There are far too many intuitive moments by the different characters, a cheap way to move the story forward. The interesting detective, Len, sort of fades away. He might have been given a stronger role, particularly in the curtailing of Mr. Harvey's activities. However, I would have gladly accepted all that if the ending had been satisfactory. The end of this story is as bad as its beginning is good. I was left wondering, \\"What the heck happened here? Did Ms. Sebold have pressing business elsewhere?\\" The ending is shabby and contrived, and left me feeling that I had wasted my reading time. The \\"swap\\" between Susie and Ruth doesn't play well at all, and the actions of the mentally disturbed (my take) mother are a bore. Better she should have stayed at the Winery. But the real disappointment is the fate of our villain, Mr. Harvey. Here is the literary equivalent of finding a dead cockroach on your plate near the end of a good dinner. I hope that Ms. Sebold gathers a new editor along her writing path. The possibility exists for her to be a contender. But not with this book.
B00000K44W|1.0|I have the impression this record's lyrics were written before its music. They fit rather uneasily, and quite a bit of the &quot;melody&quot; is just reiteration of a single pitch (especially on &quot;Journeyman&quot;, but to a significant extent also on &quot;Mouse Police&quot;, &quot;No Lullaby&quot;, and &quot;Rover&quot; as well as on the middle sections of several of the other songs). Where there are some slight wisps of actual melody, or, rather, intimations of melody, the music is particularly trite. (I'm thinking here especially of &quot;Acres Wild&quot;, &quot;Rover&quot;, and &quot;Weathercock&quot;.) <br />The lyrics seem to present a particular problem for their musical settings because they tend not to be very lyrical. They are prosaic rather, and in a clumsy, overwrought, and often insipid and smarmy manner (e.g., &quot;Good morning, weathercock/Make this day bright/Point the way to better days we can share with you&quot;). <br />Here is a typical bit of lyric chosen more or less at random:<BR>&quot;I'll make love to you in all good places/under black mountains in open spaces/by deep brown rivers that slither darkly/through far marches where the blue hare races.&quot; <br />That sounds vaguely literary, or pseudo-literary, such that it may impress those with puerile taste, but it is unlikely to have any genuine emotional or sensual effect on anyone. If you've ever taken an elementary English composition course, you can probably see why immediately. We have seven flabby adjectives (each noun is modified with at least one) and a flabby adverb, but only three verbs--only three words denoting something happening. Of these verbs only one is strong. Even so a river can slither only figuratively, if it can slither at all, and a DEEP river is unlikely to slither even figuratively. &quot;Darkly&quot; only dilutes &quot;slither&quot;. <br />Here is a contrasting example by Paul Simon that makes a strong verb tell: &quot;I know the reason I feel so blessed/My heart still splashes inside my chest.&quot; Notice that Paul Simon wisely clears the brush away from &quot;splashes&quot;. His heart doesn't splash wildly or &quot;darkly&quot;; it isn't black, brown, or blue or good, open, deep, or far.
B000056H25|5.0|This is the best movie ever about Jesus.  There are many reasons.  I will mention two.  One, Charlton Heston as John the Baptist.  Need I say more?  Secondly, the scene of Lazarus being raised from the dead.  The &quot;Hallelujah Chorus&quot; at that time is one of the most inspiring moments in movies.  Nothing, for Christians, is more inspiring than the &quot;Hallelujah Chorus&quot;, but to add it to the scene which best depicts Jesus' power is awe inspiring.  Remember that Jesus had to specify which person he wanted to &quot;come forth&quot;, or every dead person in that cemetery would have risen from the dead.
B00006JKOM|1.0|The penultimate song on John Lennon's first post-Beatles record ends thus: \\"I don't believe in Beatles. I just believe in me, Yoko and me; that's reality. The dream is over. What can I say? The dream is over--yesterday. I was the dream weaver, but now I'm reborn. I was the walrus, but now I'm John. And so, dear friends, you'll just have to carry on. The dream is over.\\"<br />There is something to be said for getting out while the getting out is good. The difficulties with \\"A Passion Play\\", the initial recording sessions as well as the concerts, ought to have made it clear that the end was at hand. We could have been spared the excruciating torment of the vacuous singles \\"Bungle in the Jungle\\" and \\"Too Old to Rock, Too Young to Die\\" and of the interminable series of dreadful Tull LP's and CD's beginning with \\"War Child\\" and including \\"Heavy Horses\\", \\"Stormwatch\\", etc.

B00005QGAT|5.0|I am 18 and love this album but my favourtie album is bad which might come as a suprise to people, anyway this album is a disco album really as 1979 was around the height of disco. Songs like 'don't stop till you get enough' and 'rock with you' classics also 'off the wall' and 'get on the floor' are great songs. This album is must have if you are a r&amp;b,pop, fan or whatever because this album has such feeling in it and you will want to dance to most of the songs.
0425152251|4.0|My little brother, who loves reading philosophy and other deep subjects, passed this book my way.  I began it not knowing at all what to expect.  I was not prepared for the amazing journey I would go on with Sophie, as her life is affected by a corresponding &quot;philisophy teacher&quot; who askes her the questions of life and explains to her how philosophers of old responded to these questions.<br />You will read some great summaries of philiosophical beliefs as they were passed down from one society to the next.  As Sophie tries to sort what she agress with and disagrees with you will do the same.  I found myself having to take time to read this book, to think about the views, and re-read some of these summaries.  You will also be taught how philosophy evolved into science, and then eventually into religion.  All in all, the book is a true simple summary of the history of philosophy, with an underlying plot that will surprize you, and even have you scratching your head now and then trying to figure out exactly wht IS going on.<br />One nice thing about this book is that I believe it could be enjoyed by adults and teens alike.  I think for high school students of philosophy this book should be a must, because the discussions it will invoke will be amazing!<br />The material is deep, seeing how it is philosophy and mans questions of existence, but the book is a light read, and won't leave you to shaken, like some soul searching books might do.  it is a fun read, especially if you enjoy pondering philosophies of life.  Remember, it is more philosophy then story, and if that is what you are looking for, you will love this.<br />I noticed new editions of this book recently in reprint at the book store, and I was excited to see it making a come back.  You will be glad you read it !
B00008GKEG|5.0|Initially I selected the Real Love video from the main menu on the special features disc, and I realized, as the video was playing, that there was no sound coming from my DVD player. I pressed the AUDIO button on the remote and noticed that the DVD player was on DTS mode (that's strange, I didn't select any audio mode previously, and my DVD player is set to play in the Dolby 5.1 mode by default). By pressing a second time the AUDIO button, I changed the setting to Dolby 5.1, and the problem was fixed. I guess this won't happen to those who have the appropiate audio equipment to enjoy DTS sound. <br />Now my comments about the anthology itself:<br />I got this DVD boxset (in its region 0, or region-free encoding release) just yesterday, and played only bits from all five discs to sample this material. When the documentary aired for the first time on ABC in late 1995, I was not able to watch all the programs; I remember watching the part when the Beatles were about to break up as a band, and when John, Paul, George and Ringo were playing on the roof. I enjoyed very much the versions of the songs that the Beatles played on that last part of the series, particularly Let It Be and the Long and Winding Road. The VHS videos of The Beatles Anthology were released here in Mexico in 1996 or 1997, but I didn't buy them then because I already had a DVD player and was amazed by the quality of audio and video that the DVD format is capable of deliver, so I decided to wait for the DVD release. From what I've seen so far now, I think it was worth waiting for this boxset, although I was hoping to see the &quot;hawaiian&quot; girls dancing at the end of the Hello Goodbye Number, instead of other material that the producers of the anthology decided to insert.
B000002A3T|5.0|The main reviewer of this album must be a techno-freak or something, but to the rest of us who like Pink Floyd this is an AWESOME album. I have owned this album for over 6 years and I still love it. Cluster one is a memorable piano/guitar opening which reminds of an elegant car ad. The best song on the album is high hopes, which embraces the atmosphere of the whole album. This album is really one of the only ones I have ever listened to that manages to take me to a different world (it reminds me of green wetlands). Other songs that are very good on it is A great day for freedom, Take it back, and especially Coming back to life. If only I can find more music that are as freshly unique and masterfully crafted!
B000050FEN|5.0|Brilliant mainstream movies seem to be increasingly rare these days, but \\"Seven\\" is surely one that will stand the test of time.  Direcotr David Fincher, with help from a terrific ensemble cast, crafted a dark, uncompromising look at the moral failings of contemporary American society.  This is not a happy movie, and you won't feel any better after watching it, but it'll certainly make you think.  On one level, \\"Seven\\" is a mystery/suspense movie, and an excellent one at that.  The plot, which I'm sure most are familiar with by now, concerns two cops, Brad Pitt's youthful Mills and Morgan Freeman's aging Somerset, on the trail of a serial killer.  As the movie develops, it turns out that the killer is basing his murders on the seven deadly sins, and finding a fiendish way to turn each one against the sinner.  Although this concept is exceedingly clever, it wouldn't make a classic movie on its own.  What elevates \\"Seven\\" above the heap is that it exploits the allegorical potential of its subject to the fullest.  More than just a simple crime drama, \\"Seven\\" is a modern morality tale for our troubled times.  The lead characters, Mills and Somerset, become representatives for two competing viewpoints.  The young Mills still thinks he can make a difference through his work, but the soon-to-retire Somerset has allowed himself to become jaded by the constant apathy he sees in society.  Unfortunately, it seems that Somerset's view has the weight of evidence behind it.  And then there's the killer, played in truly unsettling fashion by Kevin Spacey (back when he was still an excellent character actor and not a failed leading man).  Spacey's John Doe doesn't show up until there's about a half-hour left in the movie, but during his brief role he OWNS the screen.  When he explains the rationale behind his killings, it's pretty near impossible not to think about what he says.  Fincher's noirish direction tops it all off, creating a dark and oppressive atmosphere that perfectly complements the movie's subject matter.  If you're anything like me, you'll be rather depressed after watching \\"Seven,\\" but you'll be wiser for it.complements the movie's subject matter.  If you're anything like me, you'll be rather depressed after watching \\"Seven,\\" but you'll be wiser for it.

6302816580|1.0|I was just flipping through channels on a lazy Sunday afternoon and saw this movie on cable.  Why, oh why, I ask, would \\"Over The Top\\" be on cable sixteen years after its release when all available copies should have been ceremoniously burned years ago?<br />This ridiculous piece of filth is, quite possibly, the worst movie ever made.  Here's one hint as to just why this movie is so bad: it stars Sylvester Stallone as a sensitive, truck-driving arm wrestler trying to make up with his estranged son on the way to a competition.  Now, just read that sentence again.  That's right, \\"Over the Top\\" involves Sylvester Stallone trying to invest a dumb arm-wrestler with tenderness.  I'm pretty sure I could run through a brick wall before Sly could achieve such a feat.  And the script is every bit as bad as you could imagine, with dialogue so insipid and hackneyed that indecipherable gibberish written by a team of retarded, blindfolded monkeys would have been more intelligent.  I feel especially bad for the poor kid playing Stallone's son.  He must be about my age now, and he has to look back at this movie and see himself trying to breathe life into his stick figure of a character.  I think some of the lines and facial expressions he was assigned may well qualify as child abuse, or at least violate child-labor laws.  \\"Over The Top\\" probably ruined his career, just as it should have ruined Stallone's.  If that were me at around age eight, I'd probably still be in therapy.  I don't even think think \\"Over The Top\\" is good enough to qualify for \\"so bad it's funny\\" distinction.  It's just a miserable waste of celluloid that should be relegated to \\"Mystery Science Theater 3000\\" status so it can get the treatment it deserves.
B00005YW4H|1.0|Norah Jones introduces us to seven dwarves for the new milennium - this album is sleepy, samey, insipid, boring, mediocre, overrated, and derivative.<br />Oh, and by the way, it's most definitely NOT JAZZ. <br />Don't believe the hype.
B00008DDSC|4.0|&quot;Secretary&quot; is not your mother's movie about a compulsively self-mutilating woman who enters into a sadomasochistic relationship with her overbearing lawyer boss.  It's a twisted tale of two people with some serious hangups, who somehow manage to find a connection in the midst of some kinky activities at work.  Maggie Gyllenhaal plays the titular self-mutilator, Lee, who upon her release from an institution takes a job as a secretary for the stern E. Edward Grey (James Spader).  She clearly has a submissive personality, which Edward seizes upon to exercise his own dominant tendencies.  At first he just yells at her when she messes up, but pretty soon she's wearing a saddle and being spanked for making typos.  It's pretty therapeutic for both of them, and the S &amp; M activities clearly give Lee and Edward some sort of symbiotic relationship where both can work out their control issues.  One could even say it constitutes love, which is an idea that the second half of the movie addresses.  It's interesting to watch the way the dynamics of Lee and Edward's relationship develop, but what really makes the movie is the brilliant acting and director Steven Shainberg's keen eye for detail.  The whole movie is full of little subleties that had me laughing at the inspired absurdity of it all, and Spader and Gyllenhaal can convey more with a single expression than some actors can in an entire monologue.  If you're not amused at the scene where Edward gets turned on watching Lee root through a dumpster, then you'd better check your pulse.  The film's bizarre sense of humor is often reminiscent of my all-time favorite TV show, &quot;The Simpsons,&quot; but a lot dirtier.  If, like me, you're appalled at the near-constant mundaneness of mainstream cinema, you owe it to yourself to check &quot;Secretary&quot; out.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Before &quot;Elephant&quot;, I considered this duo to be one of the more interesting acts in rock -- entertaining and talented as hell, recording really good, but somewhat uneven albums.<br />After hearing &quot;Elephant&quot;, I can say with confidence that they are THE most important and exhilarating act in American rock today.  How they make such full and nuanced music from two players and an eight-track is staggering.<br />If you've never listened to The White Stripes, PLEASE don't automatically dismiss them as one of these half-assed &quot;faux&quot;-blues acts that are cropping up all over the place lately.  Musically and lyrically, these two can't be touched.<br />If, like me, you've OD'ed over the past few years on fractured, claustrophobic art-rock (Radiohead, Wilco), and dreamy, lush, productions (Luna, Beck, Coldplay), The White Stripes are a refreshing and MUCH needed change of pace.
B000069HKH|3.0|With a shorter album and a critical distance t'wards Sep. 11 tragedy, Springsteen could have made a lasting statement of the event which would be wiewd as an example of rock- the art form. Instead, he's going for immidiate emotions, not wanting to scratch deeper under the surface, and doing that he underestimates his audiences. The music itself is perfect, but there are too many songs on this one subject that it gets boring towards the end. The Rising is a step back for Bruce but hopefully he will realise it and make a better and wider record next time.

B00005RFAI|4.0|I've always been a Pink fan from the start, in which I still am.  I'm more into R&amp;B than pop, so I liked her first CD better.  I wonder why she made that transition.  This CD is good though and I really enjoyed it.  Highly recommended.
B00003CXXM|1.0|If I could give this movie 0 stars, I would. This movie was the surprise movie at the Edinburgh Film Festival. I could not believe how awful this movie was. Apparently everyone that made the movie felt the same, as not one person from the film showed up to support it. One &quot;action&quot; filled part had me and 5 or 6 people around us laughing embarassing loud. This movie is a complete joke. It ranks as possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Bad acting, see-through plot, horrible directing. Just all around bad.

6305161992|5.0|This is probably Dolph's best role.  This is also one of Brandon's best film roles as well.  A fun movie. <BR>     Dolph Lundgren is a man, and he's not afraid to act like a man!  Dolph simply oozes masculinity in this film. He's in great shape, he's confident, he picks up gorgeous women , he eats a traditional Japanese style lunch (even the old Japanese waitress can't help but to flirt with this man!), he has two residences. He is such a man that he even built himself a Japanese style home with those rice paper type walls complete with a hot tub and equipped with Japenese ninja type weapons. <BR>    Tia Carrera and most of the other women here simply ooze feminine sexuality in this film! <BR>   The very fact that Brandon Lee is in this film adds a lot.  This is probably to only film he made where his good natured personlity and sense of humor come across so well.  Dolph's Japanese upbringing and Brandon's style contrast perfectly.<BR>     They should bring this out in a widescreen version and add some extras. The picture is not bad, but could probably be improved.<BR>     Note: the Yakuza here were originally introducted in 'The Punisher', but they perfected their role here. This movie deals with the violent Yakuza and some of the sword scenes are intense. <BR>    Also I own both VHS and DVD versions of this movie,and they kept the front cover the same, but they changed the back cover. The original VHS back cover shows a nice shot of Brandon in the coffee shop, and Dolph carrying Tia in his arms. They should not have removed those shots, as they capture the film far better than what they replaced it with. <BR>     I have noticed that they are changing the covers on both the front and back of a lot of movies they convert to DVD. They are removing pictures of things like guys carrying women in their arms. If a guys has his shirt off they replace that. And they are also removing any pictures with sexy women and replacing them with shots of just their head. (they did that with Tia Carrera on the inside cover. In this movie she's very sexy but they only show her head in the inside DVD movie cover. And she has this stern expression on her face. In the entire movie she's sexy so that picture is out of place. Politically correct.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is a true story- I watched the video for bring me to life, and I thought Amy Lee was just the pretty video girl, and that the band/paul mccoy, were what would be on the CD. Once I realized that that girl was singing, I went crazy! I ran out to Best Buy and bought the cd as soon as I could! And let me tell you, it's not a dissapoitment at all. Her voice is so beautiful, and the music is so riveting, its a wonderful combination. There are ten great songs out of eleven, only because I'm not craxy about my immortal. The cd hasn't left my discman since I bought it, i LOVE it! <br />On a separate note, I have no idea why theu call themselves Evanescence, because the word means the act of dissapearing. I don't think they'll ever dissapear for me!
0142000655|5.0|This book is my all-time favorite book from my all-time favorite author. I read the first 175 pages towards the end of the eighth grade before giving it up for several months. This year, as a freshman, I read the rest of it and was blown away. It is a beautifully crafted piece about family, love, and human fate. It retells the story of the fall of Adam and Eve and the rivalry of Cain and Able in a way that shows the relevance of the story in todays time and the dangers of making your children live as you want them rather than as what they are. The Grapes of Wrath got more praise because of its' social applications but I feel that this is Steinbeck's finest novel.<br />Timshel!
B000002AGN|4.0|For some odd reason I just haven't been listening to my jazz albums lately and suddenly for no apparent reason, I had a urge to listen to some of my Dave Brubeck recordings. I wasn't born in the 50 or the 60's, when Brubeck was starting to make a name for himself with these columbia recordings, but, I'm willing to bet Dave was considered ahead of his time. Now, whether or not you like this album is a different story, but, listen to the \\"sound\\" Brubeck had. Go to a jazz club tonight, listen to a piano player, than go home and listen to Brubeck, it doesn't have to be this cd, Brubeck sounds just as \\"modern\\" as the players of today. His music transcends time. I think Brubeck is one of the few musicians who if you listen to his recordings from the 50's or the 60's he sounds fresh.<br /> As for \\"Time Out\\" it's a masterpiece. Many might say Dave made better recordings, and maybe they are right. But, \\"Time Out\\" put Brubeck where he is today. It was both comerical and artistic. The sales for the album could of went either way, but, people responded kindly to what Brubeck was doing. Of course most people will say \\"Take Five\\" and \\"Blue Rondo A La Turk\\" are their favorite tracks off the album. But, may I also suggest some other tracks to listen to. One I like very much \\"Kathy's Waltz\\". And \\"Three To Get Ready, Four To Go\\". A song that most if not all Brubeck fans are familiar with. Is \\"Time Out\\" my personal favorite Brubeck album? No, but I do enjoy listening to it. I also think that all jazz fans should at least hear the album once. And anyone that considers themself a Brubeck fan should buy it.<br /> Bottom-line: One of Brubeck's finest albums. Set Brubeck off in a new direction. One of his most \\"important\\" and most respected albums. Classic jazz.
B00006RAKP|5.0|First off, there's the surprise third disk that came with this already great collection, featuring four bonus tracks, such as the live version of &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot; and the duet of &quot;Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot; with George Michael (the long version, no less!). This is an awesome and well-presented collection of Elton John's greatest hits, expressing his full range from ballad to pop to rock. We see his evolution, and while I agree with those who say his best stuff was in the 1970s, his work from the 1980s and '90s are great, too. My only complaint is I wish that the bonus CD had included the version of &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot; honoring the late Princess Diana. Otherwise, I can't think of anything that's missing. Highly recommended for all Elton John fans of all ages.

0385503954|3.0|I found the writing style of McEwan to be meandering without being especially lyrical. There were some details that didn't need to be there, or at least not as drawn out as they were. Still, though, this is a good book in terms of looking at how writing and our imaginations affect our real lives. McEwan's description of how young Briony totally misunderstands the adult world around her is masterful, and makes her somewhat sympathetic, despite the terrible thing she has done. The ending is also something of a surprise, which makes the book worth sticking out to the end. I'd really give this 3-1/2 stars if I could, but I can't, so three stars it is. Still worth your time, though.
B000002A46|5.0|Before she decided to start dressing like a hooker and submerging herself in the 'flavor of the day' hip-hop, Ms. Carey recorded this beautiful seasonal album. It's absolutely perfect for the holidays. <br />Silent Night (4/5): This classic carol is sung wonderfully by Mariah. Choosing to restrain herself, she brings it off great. <br />All I Want For Christmas is You (4/5): The first of three new songs, this bouncy, fun number is guaranteed to lighten up anyone. <br />O Holy Night (5/5): The best-performed song on the album, Mariah brings across the emotion and spirit of Christmas in this wonderful song. That high note near the end never fails to send chills up and down my spine. <br />Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)(5/5): ANother up-tempo number, this classic pop-holiday hit is performed wonderfully by Mariah. <br />Miss You Most At Christmas Time (4/5): The album's only sad ballad, this tear-jerker is very emotional. <br />Joy To The World (5/5): A true gospel number, Mariah infuses this with a mix of devotion and emotion that is perfect for Christmastime. <br />Jesus Born On This Day (5/5): The final of the three new songs, this is the third-best song on the album. The use of a children's choir in this is pure genius, and Mariah sings it beautifully. <br />Santa Claus is Coming To Town (5/5): This playful cover of the famous tune is wonderfully fun. <br />Hark! The Herald Angels Sing (5/5): One of my very favorites, this classic hymn, though short, is another of the album's highlights. Again sung with a gospel-like feel, Mariah does this one beautifully. <br />Jesus, Oh What A Wonderful Child (5/5): This bouncy album-ender has become a church fave and one of Mariah's best. <br />Sadly, this along with DAYDREAM was Mariah's last truly great album. Since then, she's spiralled downward severely. I would recommend this album along with Celine Dion's THESE ARE SPECIAL TIMES for the holidays.
B000089RVX|3.0|I must say to begin with that I've very much enjoyed listening to this CD - and these days, that is really saying something.  Evanescence has an original sound, not perhaps instrumentally but definitely vocally. My only problem is that they don't push the envelope further. They seemed to find a sound that they liked, then rammed all of their melodies through it. I tire of the same guitar sound in almost every song. There are a few respites from this, but they are short lived at best.  <br />Do I regret buying the CD? No - absolutely not. This is an engaging brand of pop metal fused with a vaguely (sometimes overtly) Christian viewpoint.

B00003CXRP|3.0|This is a good popcorn movie, but it's far from the epic some people seem to think it is. Problems:<BR>1. The unbelievable excess of product placement re: Fed Ex.<BR>2. Hanks is a likeable actor, but not a great actor. (Come on: how much talent does it take to do his screaming and kicking frustration bit when he cuts his hand? Or to sob for his lost buddy Wilson?)<BR>3. The ending was quite disappointing; instead of finding out what happened to him immediately after his rescue, and his reintroduction to civilization, we get a hackneyed reunion with Helen Hunt (who will apparently spend the rest of her life pining for Chuck and being unhappy in her marriage). <BR>4. Overdone irony. Okay, I can believe a friend of Chuck's might unthinkingly say &quot;We'll have to catch up on our fishing!&quot;. But are we really supposed to believe anyone would have ordered sushi and crab legs for his welcome home party?<BR>5. One of my first thoughts upon seeing this movie a few years ago is that no one would have left any of the packages unopened. I joked with a friend, &quot;What if there had been a satellite phone in the box?&quot;. Then somebody finally made a commercial with the same point!
B00005JLKN|5.0|I refuse, to say that this movie was better than Silence of the Lambs, because I just loved that whole movie[jody foster especially], but after being pleasantly disappointed in Hannibal, this was a refreshing breath of Thomas Harris' brillence. I love it, I love it, I love it.
B00000IMCW|5.0|the second in george a. romeros dead trilogy, this movie, along with day of the dead (1985) are the reason zombies are zombies. director George A. Romero is the creator of the way zombies are! Movies like resident evil wish they had the talent and entertainment the dead trilogy has. This movie all starts out with a society gone mad. the dead are slowly taking over the world, as newscasters at a tv station try to urge viewers of the situation. meanwhile, two police officers, a helicopter pilot, and a newscaster flee the city in one of the tv stations helicopters. once they fled the city, they go ahead stealing gasoline from a deserted gas station, and fly over national guard troops, and rednecks hunting out the zombies. they soon discover a deserted shopping mall, not TO surrounded by zombies, and slowly start to make it their home, by killing all the zombies around, blocking the entrances, and taking advntage of all the free stuff in the mall! but soon, a biker gang discover their secret, and then raid the mall stealing everything, ripping the place apart, and leaving an open door for the living dead to roam the mall once again, and kill the group of people. this movie takes place in pittsburgh, and was shot in the famous monroeville mall. a classic, but soon forgotten film, it lives on today as one of the scariest, goriest, and frightening horror films of all time. in addition to this movie, i srongly reccomend the last in romeros trilogy, day of the dead. The dvds are rare, and cost a lot of money. that's why i own dvd copys of this movie, instead of the real thing. i suggest you wait for the new dvd releases of day of the dead, and dawn of the dead coming out later this year.
B00005JLKN|5.0|I own SOTL, Hannibal and now Red Dragon proudly. I am hoping that Thomas Harris has another adventure up his sleeve.......
B00003CY0U|5.0|Nice to see the 'X-Men' Hugh Jackman(Wolvereen) and Halle Berry (Storm) together again in 'Swordfish'. One of John Travolta's second best movies after 'Pulp Fiction'.
0066214122|3.0|This was a typical Michael Crichton theme - you know, technology and science out of control due to human irresponsibility! Although engrossing, it was not my favorite Michael Crichton novel.  <br />The whole premise of this book was based on the science of nanotechnology.  My 2 major problems with the book were not the story itself (which was highly suspenseful), but with the fact that many parts got way too technical for the non-scientific layperson and there were too many different scientific elements.  In addition to nanotechnology, for instance, the ideas of predator-prey relationships, evolutionary development and swarming characteristics were explored.  Although these were all interesting topics and the author needed each of these elements to draw the story together, it got a bit confusing at times.  I found myself skimming the super-technical parts to get to the core of the story.  I also found the ending somewhat predictable.<br />I do think, however, that this could be adapted into a really exciting great screenplay and would translate well on the big screen (but first I want to see his book &quot;Timeline&quot; in the theaters! That was my favorite Crichton book!).
0783225733|5.0|I saw this when It first came out on Video(I was too young to see it in the theathers when it came out). Its a classic, it deals with the real-life problem of getting one our our &quot;rockets&quot; back from outer space!
B00008J4P5|4.0|So, I've bought into the hype again. Except this time, that's a good thing. I bought into it with The Hives(good), and the Strokes(overrated but good) so I figured why not with the White Stripes?<br />  I'm from Memphis. I was raised on blues, rock and roll, and a little country(some hiphop and rap if you want to get right down to it). This is an excellent album. I heard Seven Nation Army on wazee.org, that's what really convinced me to buy it.<br />  If you've got an open mind about music, buy the album. I doubt you'll regret it(if you do maybe you have poor taste?)
B00008H2LE|5.0|This album is very good.  LP worked their butts off to make this album and it shows.  Just a quick background on my music tastes. My favorite bands are NIN, and Tool.  <BR>  Ok lets set a few things straight about LP and all those who choose to say this album isn't that great.  Can any of those fans actually admit that whatever LP released would have pleased them? Highly doubtful.  Why? Because Hybrid set the bar so high everyone set themselves up for disappointment, regardless of what LP would have released.<BR>  Now for all those who say they sound the same. That absurd. Why? Every band (Rage, NIN, Tool etc) has their own sound.  Compare Tool's CDs, they are all great in there own right, but you can always draw the conclusion that they sound the same.  But it's not the same, that's the band's &quot;sound&quot;. They are the same band so why would you except to hear a completely new sound from album to album? Smashing Pumpkins didn't do that, and I really can't think of many bands that do.<BR>  I really like LP and in fact I think they are one of the best new bands out on the scene in a very long time.  Ok on to the content on the cd.  I've been listening to this CD just about non-stop since the Tuesday it was released (at work, gym, home).  I don't skip any songs, I really enjoy every song for their own right.  I think that everyone will find out that they have their own favs on the CD because of their personalities, but every song is done very well.  But every time I do listen to the cd I find new things about every song I didn't notice before that makes me appreciate it even more.  <BR>  My personal favs are Numb, No One's Listening, and Session.  But again I never have to skip songs I love listening to the whole cd.  And that is another reason people might grip about, they may say that no song really stands out on the cd.  Well that can be answered solely on the fact that there are no filler songs on here, so there is no real way to compare any song to a &quot;bad&quot; song on the cd that you would normally skip.<BR>  Conclusion:  Linkin Park makes good music, this cd clearly shows that.  The album as a whole is fantastic, and I highly recommend that if you liked anything from Hybrid that you will enjoy this album, maybe even more so then their first.
B000089RVX|5.0|Its not often that I purchase a CD, but this particular band made me want to go out and buy it as soon as I could. Amy Lee's vocals are tremendous throughout the entire CD. The entire band is solid as well. Tracks of note are: Bring Me to Life, My Immortal, Imaginary and Whisper. This band has a bright future and I highly recommend it as an essential add on to your CD collection.
B000069HK2|2.0|The Used are a fine example of a band whose few radio hits and MTV music videos have given them instant popularity, without any real talent to go along with it.  They've released this one album, which is less than mediocre, and all of the sudden, a \\"faithful\\" fan base has appeared, supporting them as if they've been around for a decade.  Songs like A Box Of Sharp Objects and A Taste Of Ink may sound passable, or even decent the first few times you hear them, but once their play time is up, the interest level is drops to zero.<br />When I see The Used, I see a trendy, wannabe punk/emo act who're adored by \\"gothic\\" teenagers everywhere mainly because of the image they project, rather than their talent.  Kids see their deceptively dark and rebellious motif, and listen to their music.  And their music has just enough catchiness and mundane appeal to convince these oblivious fans that they are indeed something special when, in actuality, they are essentially [*].  For a quality new emo band, check out Finch.  For the trendiness of The Used, listen to AFI (A Fire Inside), who are actually a very good gothic punk band that has been around for a while.  Or, better yet, if you want some \\"real\\" emo/hardcore, trace this stuff back to its Husker Du and Fugazi roots.  Just whatever you do, don't buy this cd--it's a major disappointment.
6305291446|2.0|This was a OK movie.I thought it was cool to have Curtis back but this movie kinda stunk.For example,this movie isn't scary and it's too short.&quot;Jason Goes To Hell&quot; was scarier than H20.<BR>Also why did they say in the start of the movie(when the 2 cops <BR>were talking after the lady died)&quot;They never found Myer's body&quot; to make it sound like parts 4-6 never happened? This Halloween is really for the people who don't watch the other Halloween's.If your a true Halloween fan, skip H20, if your a person who didn't watch the other moviesand gets scaried easily, go on ahead and this weak Halloween movie.
B000053VJI|5.0|Compré éste disco en España en 1996 y sigue gustándome, no me he aburrido todavía de ninguna de las canciones. Mi favorita es &quot;Rompiendo Fuente&quot; que cuenta la historia del embarazo de su mujer y de la vida cotidiana en la Republica Dominicana acompañada de un ritmo tan bailable y tan hipnotico que me da escalofrios! La otra increible es &quot;Visa para un sueño&quot; que cuenta la historia de todos los que intentan a llegar a los EEUU en sus botes chicos - tiene tanta relevancia hoy en día como cuando salió en los años 90.<br />No les tengo que decir a los latinos mas de Juan Luis Guerra, sus antecedentes musicales hablan por sí. A los que hablen español pero que no sean de Latinoamerica, cómprense éste disco hoy.
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|If you love music you must obtain this cd period. Every cut is fantastic. Standouts include Pump it Up with its throbing punkish traits, Lip Stick Vogue  with its defiently witty lyrics \\"Sometimes i almost feel like a human\\" , Living in Paradise with its full bodied sound, Radio, Radio \\"You better shup up or get cut out\\", a live version of NEAT NEAT NEAT, i could list every trac the cd is that good. It was a important album when it came out giving early clues to who the true king of rock and roll is... a man named Elvis after all. WARNING dont buy this album unless you want to be blown away with an album from 1978 that is as fresh today as it way when it was the day it was pressed into an LP.  An essential album not only of Costello but of Rock.
B00003CXCQ|4.0|Not my favorite Snow White story.However with all of the aded extress and dosegess of interviwes.You will be helplessly soiled with this DVD set.Also including the Angela Lansbery tour.This is a thrilling brillian reconstructed masterpice.
B00005B36H|5.0|The Grudge- 10/10 Great musical variety for one song.<BR>The Patient- 9/10 A great song with softer vocals, but some pretty heavy guitar at some points.<BR>Schism- 10/10 Great lyrics with a good message about miscommunication and a great ending. The bass and drums really show how talented the band is.<BR>Parabol/Parabola- 10/10 Awesome guitar and drumming with great vocals.<BR>Ticks &amp; Leeches- 10/10 One of Tool's heaviest songs. Good guitar and drumming.<BR>Lateralus- 10/10 This is another song with good variety, which prevents it from becoming monotonous. Sort of like a song with 3 endings.<BR>Disposition- 8/10 A great relaxing song which leads into the most incredible song Tool has ever written.<BR>Reflection- 11/10 Wow, this song is very different from any other Tool song. Everyone in the band is incredible here (with the exception of the Danny, because most of drumming is on different percussion instruments). The vocals take some time to get used to, but when they grow on you, you will love them. The lyrics also have a great message that can be interpreted in different ways.<BR>Triad- 8/10 Good instrumental closer.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Linkin Park is a modern pop-rock band, and as such, they have to cater to a certain need in order to sell albums. Their first album, while showing no musical talent at all, displayed enough pop hooks and the right blend of guitars and rap-rock vocals to do very well and cash in on the rap-rock fad.<BR>This album, however, is a disgrace in many ways. First of all, in the 3 years it took to come up with a sophomore release, Linkin Park was only able to put together 36 minutes of music. Sure, their fans have little attention span, but this is ridiculous. I could buy the 36 minutes if it actually showed progress from their first release, but they just rehash the exact same themes ad nauseum. Which brings me to my second point - there isn't any significant progression. They have the same pseudo-teen angst lyrics to poor turntable work and sloppy and simplistic guitar riffs. Do something new. <br />And, finally, there is just alot of music out there that is infinitely better than this, yet this will be a platinum album. This album should be proof to everyone of how poor the record industry really is.
B00003CXV4|4.0|If you want to cry, go ahead and watch this. But, let me tell you. Everybody thinks I'm better looking than Keanu Reeves and that's the truth. &quot;Sweet November&quot; will make you laugh, make you cry, and maybe make you hurl. The chemistry between Nelson (Reeves) and Sara (Charlize Theron) is chucklesome, the Enya music is booming and the whole premise of the movie is hard to believe. But if you want to see a better movie and I mean WAY BETTER movie than &quot;A Walk to Remember,&quot; then check this out.
0676973779|2.0|This is by far, not the worst book I've read but it does not deserve higher than a rate of mediocre.  Life of Pi is on the best seller's list, with raving reviews so I was indeed tempted to read.  I'm quite disappointed, maybe I started with expecting too much.  I finished the book last week, but started about 6 months ago.  This is to demonstrate the motivation I had towards the story.  I just wanted to finish it and get it off my night table.<br />I can call it a fairy tale story for grown-ups I suppose.  I wouldn't recommend it.
B000063TNH|3.0|Criterion's edition of \\"Traffic\\" is virtually the same print master as the previously issued (and MUCH CHEAPER) edition from USA films.  While fine film grain is excessive and colors are presented almost completely desaturated (which is as the director intended) there is virtually nothing to distinguish this print of the movie from the previous one - except the price.  <BR>\\"Traffic\\" is an ugly little drama about kids wacked-out on narcotics and the drug smuggling apparatus that allows them to illegally enter the USA. Michael Douglas and Katherine Zeta-Jones are in it, though not together - he's the father of a crack-addicted teen, she, the unsuspecting wife of a kingpin drug lord. Benicio Del Toro cuts a swath as a Hispanic police officer who wants to do right by his job, but winds up looking the other way when the powers that be kill his partner.  I'm not giving away more than I should.  There's plenty of sick, perverted and disgusting issues to twist your stomach herein.  As pure cinema the movie plays like a hybrid Mike Wallace expose' on \\"60 Minutes\\" meets \\"The Blair Witch Project\\".  Camera work is frantic and jumpy.  The cuts happen in rapid succession.  The plot unfolds haphazardly until midway through when the audience starts to do their own piece work. Overall, I enjoyed the idea behind this movie, but I can't really get past its excessively manic style.  <BR>True to form, Criterion give us some real \\"toss-away\\" extra features. Like extra audio commentaries (as if one isn't enough) and some deleted scenes that really don't enhance your viewing or understanding of the film.  My personal favorite of the extra features, one that Criterion loves to include(virtually every one of their discs has one) is the critical essay.  But honestly - does anyone \\"read\\" type-written articles on their big screen television?  I would much prefer a book or pamphlet with this same info that I could read at my leisure  without worrying that the on-screen font was burning itself  into my picture tube.  <BR>BOTTOM LINE: Buy DVD's with pristine image quality.  That said, why buy Criterion if someone else is minting the identical disc for a cheaper price? You're just throwing away money on extras that don't really matter!
B0000214F0|4.0|The acting is both tremendous and pathetic.  The sets are flat-out amazing and cheesy.  The characters are deep and shallow.  There are both sex and violence in spades.  If you want a campy, sexy (even hard-core at moments), crass look back at the Roman Empire then this movie could very well be your cup of tea.  M. McDowell is his usual shining self, even when direction seems to fail him.  Other stars seem to mail in thier performances.  Nevertheless, the movie, when viewed as a 70's Penthouse production, is pretty darned good.  The story is really quite good.  And the sex scenes certainly don't hurt!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|When I bought this album I expected what anyone would expect of <BR>Johnny Cash, a good country music album, but is was so much more.<BR>From the powerful intro on the title track The Man Comes Around, until the last note of We Will Meet Again it's worth every second. The best song on the album is without a doubt Hurt,and to hear Johnny sing that, moved me and I cried the first time I ever heard it. He does such a great job with Depechmode's Personal Jesus, which gives the song a totally new meaning. Lastly, I HAVE to say that Sam Hall is my favorite song of the album and the phrase &quot;Damn your eyes&quot; makes me laugh every time.<BR>I would recomend this to anyone
B00005B4GU|3.0|Radiohead has a knack for making music that is consistently better than everything else out on the market.  However...this album seems more like someone else that was inspired by Radiohead's Kid A and tried to make an album like Kid A...only not as good as Kid A.  <br />Still, this album is better than almost everything played on the radio at the moment.  Hopefully their next album will be better than this...Radiohead can do much much better than this.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Since their first albumn, the White Stripes keep getting better and better with time, and with every albumn they make.  Five stars for having a variety of guitar solos, simple but catch &amp; meaningful drum beats, blues,&amp; punk/alternative rock, laid back &amp; classic rock approach.  Elephant is a must have albumn to purchase for your CD collection.  Simple, longer, heart felt, &amp; fun are the descriptions of this new albumn.  BUY IT.
B000003S5H|5.0|This album is great.  It infuses jazz with electronica and smart pop music.  It has a real flow to it...it just seems natural.  I know that Air is mostly an elctronic group, but most people seem to resort to loops, and heavy programming.  Somehow, the two frenchmen have made something that almost seems dated in its appeal.  Most of the songs seem like pop songs from the 60's...only more emotional.  <br />So if you like oldies, jazz, or electronica, this album will probably please you.

B00008AWOD|3.0|I became a huge Placebo fan after the release of Black Market Blood. Own all 3 past recordings and have eagarly awaited thier lastest release. Maybe I was just too psyched, but after hearing &quot;The Bitter End&quot; a month before the album release, I totally expected &quot;Sleeping with Ghosts&quot; to be an all out classic Placebo record. I was somewhat dissapointed. The boys seem to have mellowed out a bit. There are some great songs like The Bitter End, This Picture, Special Needs, Plasticine and Second Sight, that could be put alongside with their past classic songs. The other songs do grow on you but for me will probally not hold up with time. Overall the guys put out an ok record.

B00005B4GU|4.0|A follow up to their icy 2000 masterpiece Kid A, Amnesiac performs the closure of the tale Kid A initiated. <br />It portrays a bleaker world than Kid A (if that's possible).<BR>Pact Like Sardines is the only song that doesn't make you want to crouch with your head in your hands. It's almost danceable. A trip through a synthesizer with kettle drums on the edge. <br />Pyramid Song is pure romance, a fever dream decked with imagery  the wailing violins enhances the melacholic ambience created by thom's vocal and piano. I wondered how Phil could possibly manage to drum to that wicked piano time...but he pulled it off.<br />Pulk Pull: the only way to enjoy that is to get stoned, can be a real grinder then.<br />You and Whose Army, purportedly dedicated to Tony Blair, is characterized by a lazy thom drawl, and one of the bleakest chord sequences ever. The moody ambeince is further enhanced by the lack of treble... It's also got one of the most climactic outros in Radiohead's career. <br />I Might Be Wrong revolves around a gritty riff by johnny. A true guitar song, probably the one that would most appeal the pre kid-a, riff lovers.<br />Knives out bears a resemblence to Paranoid android, probably not deliberate. Guitar chords again, and the classic thom wail, It would've been more at home in OK. But nevertheless, classic.<br />This version of Morning Bell with actual bells, somehow makes me imagine waking up on resurrection day. <br />Hunting Bears sadly, has to be overlooked. A go nowhere tune, signifying nothing else than that even the greatest of bands is susceptible to writers block at times. <br />The Jazzy Dollars and cents is restrained at first, and explodes in a &quot;blinding&quot; supernova, an outstanding track.<br />Like Spinning Plates, is an emotional mix of music and technology, art and science, a delicate, melancholy song, that makes you feel like, well, spinning plates.<br />The lethargic closure, Life In A Glass House, invokes a picture of dreary 40'spubs that hollywood depicts, and having one drink too many...feeling the warm blackness engulf you, while you ramble on...and on...
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee, a Southern woman, wrote the Great American Novel. Without demeaning the quality and value of \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" or \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" or \\"The Great Gatsby\\" -- great American novels all -- \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" summarizes a nation in constant flux, always examining its personal values, forever wondering whether there is something bigger than each of us.<br />The story of Scout Finch, her family, friends and acquaintances is the story of an entire nation, whether Harper Lee intended to write a universal story or not. This is not just a book worth reading; it is a book thet should be read by every American reader, lest we begin to believe that Tom Clancy, Stephen King, John Grisham and Danielle Steel are great (or even good) writers who reflect the complexity and depth of American literature.
B000002MP2|5.0|this is by far the best green day cd ever(besides international superhits,but that really doesnt count) dookie has some of the top hits of the 90s on it,including longview,basket case ,and when i come around. anyways this is what i think of each song on the CD.<br /> BURNOUT- this is a great song and it should have been released as a single,it could have gotten a lot of radio airplay.<BR>HAVING A BLAST- not really a great song, but its ok to listen to a few times<BR>CHUMP- this is a good song that goes very well with longview right after it.<BR>LONGVIEW- this is one of my favorite green day songs ever,its also the most profane green day hit ever.<BR>WELCOME TO PARADISE- this is a great song that was originally released on KERPLUNK.<BR>PULLING TEETH- a pretty coll song,but it can get annoying after a while<BR>BASKET CASE- this is an AWESOME song,its one of green days best ever. it has a pretty cool video too<BR>SHE- this is a cool song that statrs out slow and then gets loud.<BR>SASSAFRAS ROOTS- this is a good song that could have been released as a single also,i really think it could have been a hit.<BR>WHEN I COME AROUND- this is an another cool song that any true green day fan will love.<BR>COMING CLEAN- one of the best songs on the CD,i cant see any reason why this wasnt released on a single and had a video made for it. this is really good song.<BR>EMENIUS SLEEPUS-this is also a good song, but its nothin special.<BR>IN THE END- this song is probably the big letdown of the CD,it really isnt a very good song at all.<BR> F.O.D....this is a sorry song until it gets to the hidden track(All By Myself)the hidden track is kinda messed up and the song actually [stinks] but its funny.<BR>          OVERALL I THINK THIS IS A MUST BUY CD FOR ANY PUNK FAN OR RELLY ANYONE WHO LIKES ROCK.
0440237688|4.0|I read this story in order to prepare for when I have my class read it.  I thought the story was well done and very rivoting, that is, until the ending. The story goes along fine until the last chapter and it seems like Lowry just got tired and wanted to finish it off without having to really develop it. It was quite abrupt and disappointing. I know that the author wants to leave the ending open, the reader comes up with their own conclusion. But I think she was wrong with leaving it so ambiguous. Even when she was given the Newbery award she refused to clarify the ending. This is not the kind of thought provoking ending I want to give middle school students. I believe they will find it disturbing and feel cheated (as I did) at leaving it unresolved. I read \\"Gathering Blue\\" and felt much better after having read that book. <br />Lowry did state in and interview that she sees the ending (in The Giver)as optimistic ...  I can't take ambiguity! I need closure! The book would have deserved a 5, except for the ending.
0553382179|5.0|I still can't believe the impact that this book has had on my life.    It is so ingeniously simple, it's hard to remember why my house was always such a disaster.  Reading through the book initially, I was just happy to hear that there are other cleaning-challenged people out there.  But by applying the system, my house looked better on the very first day.  Each day, my house looks better, and I go to sleep peaceful.  While I have changed my routine, I am spending no more time on housework than I had been previously.  I am just better at it now, and the results are so obvious.  And I don't spend my weekends anymore just wandering around the house,overwhelmed by the mess, and never getting anything accomplished.  I have recommended this book to everyone I know.  And it makes a great housewarming gift!
0395193958|5.0|What can I say about this edition-not a whole hell of a lot. It's the same story, a new cover which, might I add, is charmingly seductive. The leatherette collector's edition is a rich, catchy word. Say it in the morning. Say it in the evening. Buy a sword and slaughter some orcblood at your neighbor's house and all the way to the mines of moria*cough*jail as you fend of goblins*hack*cops every step of the way. Good for old people. Good for people that don't need vigoroso500 yet. And AWESOME for people who don't know what I'm talking about.

B00005YXZH|4.0|Jeff Tweedy has long since left his so called &quot;alt country&quot; roots in the dust.  YHF finds him seamlessly blending great songwriting with electronic freakout, although sometimes he goes a little over the edge with the found sounds and electronics.  The CD has a lazy, stoned feel to it throughout, which is undoubtedly the condition in which it was created.<BR>He's opening for REM on part of their tour, although this music lends itself much better to a club than an arena, because this is very intimate, F'd up music that is best appreciated up close.
0800111680|5.0|At a local movie theater on the first Monday of the month they run one showing of a classic movie. One day I saw that The Bridge on the River Kwai was playing. I walked out of the theater knowing I had seen one of the best movies ever made.<BR>     The plot is about a bridge being built by Allied prisoners of war. The battle centers around two strong willed men. Col Nicholson (Alec Guinness) a british commander who refuses to comply with Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa)who runs the camp. During this battle Cmdr./Maj. Shears (William Holden) escapes only to be called back into duty to destroy the bridge that now Nicholson has taken great pride in constructing.<BR>     This is one of those movies that is slow paced but done so deliberetly. Director David Lean paces the movie so by the end you don't even want to go to the bathroom, (Lean would use the same style in the brilliant Lawrence of Arabia).
B00000064F|5.0|This is just a CD you've got to have.  Once you've gotten to know it, you'll start hearing Drake's influences in musician after musician who knows what he/she is doing.  Beck, Robyn Hitchcock, Jim White, Lucinda Williams, David Byrne, Vic Chesnutt.  That's just for starters. The list of people who cite Nick Drake as an influence goes on and on. Once you get this CD, you'll want to dig into Drake's entire catalog, which, unfortunately, is only 3 or 4 official albums.  Amazing musician who made an incredible splash in his short life and limited number of recordings.

B00006CXSS|2.0|This series has not been on German television so far, and there's probably a reason for that: it's unauthentic. While the characters, setting and story are very nicely done, the enemy, i.e. us, the Germans, no matter whether SS or Fallschirmjaeger, are depicted mostly as military imbeciles. At the same time Easy Company NCOs are the personified Army-Ethic, role models no matter what way you look. The sign language the troopers use is supposed to look oh so professional. Mr. Hanks seems to want to make a point with at least one surrending German getting shot every epsisode, which was against Geneva convention even back then. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate war movies, but BoB is so much blind glorification it's almost propaganda. Is there something from with war? Not according to Band of Brothers, it only makes men out of boys. And because BoB is so busy celebrating US troops, it doesn't get much beyond entertainment. If we go on making these movies, we're going to slide into more wars again and again.
B00000J6AG|1.0|This review will never see the light of day, nonetheless it must be written so that hopefully it will have a negative effect on the 4 1/2 star rating Moby's album currently has.  Sadly the world is ripe for the likes of Moby.  Millions upon millions of mindless, musically impaired twits, who think that DJs like Moby are actually musicians, sing (out of key) the praises of this modern adaptation of The Emperors New Clothes.<BR>His album, Play, is a testament to the depths of human suffering.  Surely no man could have more accurately put to disc the sea of emotions present on Play.  From boredom to depression, rage (at his inability to create new music) to madness, Moby knows pain like no other man in history.<BR>That said, Mobys &quot;album&quot; is horrible excrement that epitomizes everything that's wrong with music today.  On the other hand if you enjoy repetitious samples and funky drum beats and have an inability to whistle in tune, then Play is right up your alley.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones' rise to fame has been nothing short of meteoric. Her much talked about debut album \\"Come Away With Me\\" has been a huge success worldwide, topping both the US and UK charts - one of the first female records to do so since Alanis Morissette's \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" back in 1996. The album has sold 10 million copies worldwide already, and looks like it's going to continue selling and selling. There aren't many jazz artists who can do this. It seems to me a bit like right time, right place for Jones, and her popularity has only rocketed since her recent multi-Grammy award win. All this said, I do consider Jones to be a very talented artist who boasts a brilliant debut album.<br /><br />Come Away With Me opens with the soothing single \\"Don't Know Why.\\" This brilliant jazz piece has a great beat and wonderful lyrics from Norah that give off a feeling of longing, yet a certain feeling of resolution without taking any action. \\"Seven Years\\" is a song filled with joy and innocence. \\"Spinning, laughing, dancing to her favorite song. A little girl with nothing wrong is all alone,\\" croons Jones on this perfect ballad. Perfect to chill to. \\"Cold Cold Heart\\" is a cover of the Hank Williams song and has a great bassline which almost has a cowboy-type texture to it. The song is about someone's cold heart, but Norah's silky vocals melt it down to its simplest form. She asks why she can't melt our cold, cold hearts, without knowing she has done exactly that. \\"Feelin' The Same Way\\" is one of my favourite songs from this album. This song has a great beat to it, which is rather up-tempo (something you won't come across too often on this record) and is rather catchy. The song seems to spin around in circles, perfectly matching the title of the song.<br /><br />\\"Come Away With Me,\\" the album's amazing title track, is another album highlight. I have gently fallen asleep to this song on many occasions, because it is just so relaxing and soothing. The video to this song features Norah in a car in the middle of the sunny desert, but the beat sounds just like slowly falling snow. The piano solo by Norah is also excellent. \\"Shoot The Moon\\" and \\"Turn Me On\\" are two songs which I don't really enjoy much, but seem to be mentioned by other reviewers quite a lot. \\"Lonestar\\" has a great sweeping beat, with Norah's vocals on top form. It has a country music feel to it, with its two-note vocal piece as she wishes for a sign from the night sky. \\"I've Got To See You Again\\" was my instant favourite song from this album. This is now not so, but I still enjoy this song a lot. Norah's vocals are at their most soulful ...on this great song about confused love. It's the longest song on the album, so we really get a chance to enjoy it, and the addition of the violin makes for a welcome change.<br /><br />\\"Painter Song\\" is just class. This amazing song is perhaps my favourite on the album with its excellent beat and vocals. All this is just brilliant, but the addition of the accordion (cheesy, but oh so classy!) is just stunning. \\"If I were a painter, and could paint a memory, I'd climb inside the swirling skies to be with you,\\" wails Ms. Jones on this perfect song to doze off to. \\"One Flight Down\\" is another great song with its noticeable piano intro, followed by some great lyrics. Full of secret meanings and memories, the song showcases Norah's rather clear and song vocals. \\"Nightingale\\" has perfect lyrics and a deep sound that provokes wild memories in the mind, in an almost lullaby style. \\"The Long Day Is Over\\" is yet another good song and probably the slowest on the album - another one that is perfect to fall asleep to. \\"The Nearness Of You\\" will be the song that wakes you up with its outstanding vocals that sound incredibly fresh but old and classic at the same time.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />This album has received a lot of criticism - most of which I cannot understand why. Norah does write some of her own material, and she has a wonderfulvoice. Anyone who says her vocals are cringeworthy needs their ears checked. She is a truly talented and exceptional young lady who I can see going a long way with follow up albums. She isn't riding on the back of her father's (Ravi Shankar) success, as his classical Indian style is completely different. Her Texas upbringing has brought out the best in her individual style of Western Jazz. This isn't a perfect debut album (I've heard better), as it could have done with a few more toe-tappers and variety in the tempos, but give her time. Norah will prove herself as her vocals mature. Trust me.cringeworthy needs their ears checked. She is a truly talented and exceptional young lady who I can see going a long way with follow up albums.

B00000099Y|1.0|If there's anything more boring than listening to this album, it's hearing nerdy fanboys drooling over Tool. \\"Oh, Tool is genius, they play such insane time signatures, blah blah blah...\\" <br />Look, Tool is nothing but snooze-core sludge rock. Their tuneless, repetitive music lulls you to sleep, and their lyrics really aren't anything to write home about. They play their instruments well but they can't write songs. If you want to hear something artsy and innovative, you're much much better off with Radiohead. At least Radiohead can write hooks.  <br />Music geeks and suicidal stoners might get a bang out of this depressing sludge, but anyone else should really steer clear. The most entertaining thing about this band by far is their videos.

B00004Z400|4.0|WHITE PONY is a great record from a band I really wasn't interested in until I heard the single \\"Change\\" on the radio back in mid-2000. It wasn't until a few weeks ago that I decided to actually purchase their record to hear it in its entirety (I had downloaded the single along with a few others before this). I must say I am pleasantly surprised... I generally don't go for the rap-rock thing but they are melodic enough and keep the outright rapping to a minimum. Tracks range from melodic and beautiful (\\"Knife Party,\\" \\"Teenager\\") to ridiculously heavy but still very well-written and melodic (\\"Elite,\\" \\"Korea\\"). The best songs, in order, would be \\"Passenger,\\" \\"Knife Party,\\" \\"Change,\\" and \\"Elite.\\" The added track \\"Back to School\\" is simply a heavier version of \\"Pink Maggit\\" with rap-style vocals, but is still worth the extra [money]this version will set you back as opposed to the original release. Overall, any heavy rock fan should give this one a listen, particularly those whose tastes include Korn, Tool (Maynard sings on the astounding \\"Passenger\\"), and the like.
B00008GKEG|5.0|If you are a boomer, than you must consider yourself fortunate to have grown up at a time of exhilerating excitement and hope, epitomized by rock's greatest singer/songwriters.  With the DVD release of Anthology, along with MOJO's current special series, this is a wonderful time to reflect back on the joy and wonder, and especially the power of the music that stirred a generation.  I truely wish that others had followed in their footsteps that could bring similar bliss and enpowerment to subsequent generations, but I guess \\"the dream is over\\", or at least on long-term hold.<BR>     The anthology itself is superbly constructed, much better than what was aired on ABC years ago.  Even at 10 hours there are large chunks missing (Stu's death, John's early marriage), but the important thing is that this document collects so much valuable audio and film/TV clips that not only remind just how much stuff the group produced in a decade, but also where it all came from.  This really is a class act.<BR>     Onced upon a time is all we got to get us through the dark days, as we wait for new heroes to emerge to help us shake off the blue meanies once again.
B00003CXXO|3.0|I love good science fiction.  For me, a good plot can overcome mediocre acting and special effects.  However, wonderful acting and super technology cannot overcome a cumbersome and disturbing plot.  The main character, David, was wonderful.  I cringed with sadness for him countless times.  Gigilo Joe and Teddy Bear were entertaining side kicks.  <br />So much of this movie was wrought with hopelessness and sadness, that two and a half hours proved far too long.  Additionally, the troubling ending in Manhattan did not mesh well at all with the epilogue in the far future.  The latter could have been a short on the sci fi channel.<br />The bottom line is that I loved the characters, but just did not like the story.  I cannot deny the talent and art that when into this work, thus the three stars.  Nevertheless, I finished the movie glad it was over, and eager not to dwell on the dejected musings of its author.
0920668372|1.0|I received this book as a baby shower present and I really thought it was creepy.  I did not care for the image of the mother literally crawling into the baby's room in the first place and it just got worse from there.  Granted, no one is really going to go the lengths in this story but I still felt it symbolized an overprotective mother who doesn't know when to let go.  This story doesn't portray love; it portrays obsessiveness.

0440237688|3.0|In my opinion, \\"The Giver\\" was an excellent book.  It dealt with a future that is both frightening in its reality and illuminating in the way their society is run.  Dealing with the story of a growing boy who is about to face his life's job for the first time, Jonas is chosen for the most respected job.  He is the Receiver of Memories, who remembers everything of the history of the race so that the general public doesn't have to.  They live in a world without color, emotion, or choice of any kind - they are even given pills to prevent sexual urges.  Lois Lowry combines the idea of communism to the extreme with the idea that even a twelve-year-old child can change society if he so chooses in a story that makes you appreciate how horrible a life like that could be in comparison to all of the choices we make today.
B000002LGQ|4.0|Madonna's first great album, lyrically this is a milestone above previous LPs, with personal and sometime sombre insights interspersed with well intended self help messages. While still very much poppy, the instramentation is more varied, more acoustic and for once the album tracks nearly live up to the quality of the singles. Lover's of pop, funk, gospel, dance, and aching ballads will all find something to lvoe on this album.<br />Top Cuts: Like A Prayer, Oh Father, Till Death Do Us Part.

Instead, get the three disc set with \\"Castle in the Sky\\" and \\"Kiki's Delivery Service.\\" These are the best works from Miyazaki's Studio Ghibili that deserve to exceed amazon's five star rating:<br />Nausicaa: Valley of the Wind (1984)<BR>Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986)*<BR>My Neighbor Totoro (1988)*<BR>Grave of the Fireflies (1988)*<BR>Kiki's Delivery Service (1989)*<BR>Porco Rosso (1992)<BR>Princess Mononoke (1997)*<BR>Spirited Away (2001)*<br />People who have seen most of Miyazaki's work usually have a favorite from these 8. You are all in luck. 6 (see *) of those 8 are now available in the US (although \\"Totoro\\" is only available in English dub). You might be spoiled after seeing so many animation masterpieces at once. The good news is, they're all great no matter how many times you see them.

B00008J4P5|5.0|The album descriptions have been well covered in previous reviews, so I just wanted to say that I have not been awed by an album since Radiohead's &quot;OK Computer&quot;.  By awed, I mean shaking my head every few songs in utter disbelief at what I was hearing.  By the end of track 8 I knew that this is one of the best records to come out in the past decade.  It doesn't matter if this album does or does not sound like previous Stripes efforts, or like the Stooges, or the MC5, or Zepplin, or whatever.  This album is jaw-droppingly good in its own right.  Thank you Jack and Meg.
B00005J6T1|2.0|While its importance in bringing r&amp;b fused dance music to the mainstream should not go unregarded, there's still no hiding that Madonna's self titled debut contains mostly shallow dance/pop songs with even shallower lyrics. It sounds dated almost to cringe inducing levels.<br />Top Cuts: Holiday, Borderline, Burning Up

0316286850|5.0|This book is said to be America's #1 book which is 100% true not only the material and content it contains is great but also the paper quality is excellent. It contains 200 pages few excellent tips and 24 great looks!!! along with it also provides each looks description (what makes one look different from the other)Honestly I did not even know so many amazing looks existed.<br />   Book also contains not only different shades of lip and eye colors but also how many different textures can they be in e.g creamy, sheer, glossy, mettalic, matte along with their pics. It also contains different kinds of powders, foundations,<BR>brushes and how they are to be used.<br />     Their are a few quality pictures of Celebrities such as Janet Jackson, Nicole Kidman, Cher, Kate, Marylin Monroe several others but my personnal favourite is Julia Roberts... I would also like to add even though this book is excellent but it is not for beginners especially not for those who do not know anything about make up because it lacks detailed explaination of technique used.
B00000IN5G|4.0|my personal favorite Bodom cd is Follow the Reaper, but, thats mainly because that cd follows my musical compisitional train of thought very closely, that and its just kickass. anyways back to the topic of Hatebreeder which has alot of classicalish stylings in the solos and breif interludes, the growl could be a little better from the lead vocalist, but i guess it works. but over all its worth getting.
B00005MNP8|5.0|Remember the line in &quot;Men in Black&quot; where Tommie Lee Jones tells Will Smith, &quot;This means I have to buy a new copy of the White Album&quot; after showing him a futuristic audio device?  Well, I only have one version of the White Album, but I've bought PARALLEL LINES in every form it's been released.  Not because I no longer have the equipment to listen to it, mind you, but because I wore them all out!  My purchase of this CD was due to the grief I still felt for the cassette tape, which met a sorry end in my clock radio set.<br />The remastered version does not disappoint.  It takes you right back to 1978, when we found out that punk didn't just mean Johnny Rotten's verbal sputum or the political pessimism of the Clash.  Punk could be Fun!  Debbie Harry's versatile, clear-as-a-bell voice is the highlight, from the opening growl on &quot;Hangin' on the Telephone&quot; to the oozy sweetness of &quot;Sunday Girl&quot;.  It exudes mystery in &quot;Fade Away &amp; Radiate&quot;, utter desperation in &quot;Will Anything Happen&quot; and &quot;11:59&quot;,  and sarcastic poutiness in &quot;Go Away&quot; and &quot;Pretty Baby&quot; (an ode, by the way, to Brooke Shield's scandalous child character in the movie of the same name).<br />The bonus tracks I can take or leave.  I like the live version of &quot;Hangin' on the Telephone&quot;, but &quot;Once I had a Love&quot; is a weak version of &quot;Glass&quot;. The cover of Marc Bolan's &quot;Bang a Gong&quot; is an interesting element, since it brings the number of gender-bending songs to three (including &quot;Baby&quot; and &quot;Sunday Girl&quot;), but not an especial showcase for the band. Never mind, this is still at the top of my list of discs I would take to a desert island (along with the corresponding audio equipment!).
B000002H2H|3.0|My friend, Tommy, had let me borrow this last Monday. I just now finished listening to the whole thing in one sitting, so I'll give you my impression of the album. Keep in mind that I'm not a metal fan. This is the first Metallica album that I've listened to in its entirety. I suppose that it would be considered great by a metal fan, but it's merely okay background music to me. It really didn't hold my attention much. It's a classic 1980s metal album, and a lot of Metallica fans agree that it's the band's best. Most of it is fast. Some of it is slow. The theme of this album is death in different forms (suicide, the killing of the first-born sons in Egypt, electrocution, drowning, etc.). It sounds a lot better to me than the [stuff] that I heard on the radio from 2000 to 2001 (when I worked as a night stocker at a supermarket and had to listen to the local metal station). The final track is an instrumental. I guess I like it. If Konami ever makes a CastleVania game set in the 1980s, they should use this track for one of the stages. My point is that, if you're not a metal fan, you won't like this album, but, if you are a metal fan, you probably will like this album.
B00006RU5B|4.0|Having never liked anything from Rage outside of &quot;killing in the name&quot; and never listened to enough Soundgarden to get into them, I didn't expect to like this much. But, after a few hears of &quot;Cochise&quot; it started to grow on me and upon first listen of &quot;Like a Stone&quot; I was hooked. This is sort of like Rage with Soundgarden like everyone says but it also has a stonerish type quality to it as well. The only problem is, contrary to popular belief, I don't find Cornell's voice all that great so after awhile his voice does tend to grate on my nerves but this is still a really good band. This was a really good idea I think and I hope this band prospers for a while. The guys did better without Zach. MUCH better. Rap was not meant for rock.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I've been listening to rock music for 30 years, and I can't remember the last time I was this excited about a record.  The White Stripes are the freshest, most passionate band to hit the scene since Nirvana.  From the blistering punk of &quot;Black Math&quot; to the swaggering blues of &quot;Ball and Biscuit,&quot; to the plaintive but scorching &quot;I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself,&quot; the Stripes display an eclectic range of influences without ever sounding derivative. Whether you're 14 or 40, if you love rock and roll, buy this disk and play it loud.
0385504209|5.0|This book was simply amazing. It is a classic page-turner that keeps you guessing until the end. What I found most interesting was the amount of Catholicism in the book.

B000068QY7|1.0|I love Oasis but let's not kid ourselves, Heathen Chemistry is by far the worst Oasis album ever recorded. Songs like Little by Little, Stop Cryin' your Heart Out and Song Bird are incredibly simplistic and belong on soft-rock FM radio stations along side the likes of Michael Bolton and Celine Dion. On Born on a Different Cloud, Liam's vocals have never sounded worse. With the exception of Hindu Times, the rest of the album is strictly filler material (i.e, Force Of Nature, Hung In A Bad Place, A Quick Peep...) What ... were they thinking when they included this junk? Come on Noel! Take control of your band and start writing some good music again!

The strings are good and the lyrics are nice and romantic, but I'm afraid I'm not one for romantic lyrics.  Besides, it sounds like a soul/R&B song, which I don't really have an ear for.

B00004XOWM|1.0|Look i loved limp bizkit but when was that, like when i was 9, oh well any way limp bizkit have lost their touch like sparkart said but not only that, they are very untalented, i mean who thinks fred durst is cool when he tries to beat the records of the most swear words in a song like hot dog, any way its pretty pathetic that fred durst has to hide his poor song writing with the f words, and look young fans of limp bizkit are gonna know fred is a phony one day once they realise he is not hardcore and its not cool to swear all the time. Look i don't mind a bit of swearing but when its like too much swearing then no i don't like it, and just too prove to you kids that im not a phony who just bags out a band without listening to it, heres a discription and a rating, plus i'll even say how long each track goes for, and yes i do own it.<br />1.INTRO: a boring intro with just electronicy space music. 1:18<br />2.HOT DOG: oh dear, yes this is the song with 46-48 f words. Poor lyrics as well, this song is mainly just a rhyme with f words in it. 3:50 0/10<br />3.MY GENERATION: ahh this is one of limp bizkits good songs, decent guitar riffs, nice bridge in the middle when he says you take the blame. This is one of freds best songs on the album. Though it gets very old. 3:41 8/10<br />4.FULL NELSON: a crap song with fred just repeating you'll get knocked the f**k out. This is the heaviest song but its horrible. 4:07 2/10<br />5.MY WAY: i like this song, its slower than most of limp bizkits stuff. This song starts out with some wierd voice saying check, check out, the melody. Not bad. But it was over played and sadly limp bizkits songs do get old fast. 4:23 7/10<br />6.ROLLIN': a horrible song. Its way to catchy, repetitive, and the song writing is awful. Starts out with fred saying allright partner you know what time it is, keep on rollin baby. 3:34 3/10<br />7.LIVIN IT UP: its below average, he swears a bit too much for stupid reasons. Any way starts out with a wierd voice saying life in the fast lane, and then fred raps about pointless stuff. 4:24 4/10<br />8.THE ONE: this song is very boring, the lyrics are better atleast but its to boring and slow and he has such an annoying voice, starts out with im dead from all the loneliness and the chorus is this could be the one. 3:42 3/10<br />9.GETCHA GROOVE ON: too much swearing for pointless reasons, and i don't like xzibit whos featured in this song. Starts out with xzibit sayin millenium .... 4:29 2/10<br />10.TAKE A LOOK AROUND: ok song, starts out with fred saying all the tensions in the world today, all the little girls fillin up the world today and then in the chorus you hear him say i know why you wanna hate me. At least there is not as many swear words but its still a not so good song. 5:18 5/10<br />11.IT'LL BE OK: a boring song talking about leaving a girl friend. Gets old very quickly you see after a couple of listen s of the album you get sick of it. 5:06 4/10<br />12.BOILER: Not bad, in fact i like it a bit, because he is actually expressing his anger and when he swears he swears for a reason. Another song talking about a relationship. Check out the video clip. 5:47 7/10<br />13.HOLD ON: the slowest song on the album, horrible, he can't sing. 5:47 1/10<br />14.ROLLIN'(urban assault vehicle): such an awful way to end the album. Feartures red man, swizz beatz, method man and fred. You would have to be a mega hardcore rap fan to like this, though in my opinion i don't like it and it has too much swearing for no reasons. 6:23 -1/10(yep, thats a minus)<br />15.OUTRO: not funny!!!! 2:01<br />So overall don't get this album go get his older on 3 dolla bill if you have to get an album by limp bizkit. If you want a band like limp bizkit check out linkin park, they are slightly less rappy, and way more talented, not that i like them but they did win last year an award for the best selling album which was hybrid theory.

It is a tribute to the direction of Alfred Hitchcock that one is never bored watching this film, though it entirely takes place within the confines of a claustrophobic New York Greenwich Village apartment,  the windows of the neighbors across the way, and a courtyard that separates the buildings.<br />Professional photographer L.B. \\"Jeff\\" Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart) is recovering from an accident that occurred while on assignment. Encased in a cast covering his left leg and hip, Jeff is pretty much immobilized and temporarily confined to a wheel chair. Despite regular visits by his nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter), and his beautiful, sophisticated girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly), Jeff is chafing at his confinement. Bored stiff, he does what he does best. He peers at those around him from his window. Jeff finds the lives of his neighbors both  immensely interesting and amusing. He watches them through their windows and in the courtyard, enhancing his experience with binoculars and the zoom lens of his camera. Jeff draws inferences and  conclusions about them, based upon his own experiences with human behavior.<br />This interest intensifies and takes a strange turn, when he believes one of them, Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), may have committed a grisly murder, killing off his invalid wife, Anna. Though Jeff never actually sees the murder, what he does see is its aftermath and some peculiar behavior that puzzles him.  Putting two and two together, he becomes absolutely convinced that his neighbor across the way has done away with his invalid wife. Jeff then informally involves his friend, Lt. Thomas Doyle (Wendell Corey) of the New York City Police Department, who initially scoffs at Jeff's assessment, though he does a cursory check . With Lisa and Stella also becoming fascinated by the strange behavior of Lars Thorwald, their interest and amateur sleuthing  propels the film to an exciting climax.<br />Jimmy Stewart is terrific as the housebound voyeur, drawing the viewer in with him. One finds oneself peering along with him into the lives of those around him. Grace Kelly is stunningly beautiful as Jeff's girlfriend Lisa, with whom Jeff is finding it difficult to make a commitment. It is interesting that as Jeff gets more intimately engrossed in his neighbors' affairs, his intimacy with Lisa seems to grow, drawing them closer together. Thelma Ritter is funny and sassy as the tough talking, no nonsense nurse. Raymond Burr, looking eerily as he would half a century later, is well cast as the neighbor whose wife got on his nerves. Wendell Corey is very good as the congenial, though jaded, detective.<br />All in all, this is a terrific film that clearly shows the mastery and deft direction of the legendary Hitchcock. With a well written script and a stellar cast, this is a film that is well worth having in one's personal collection. Bravo!housebound voyeur, drawing the viewer in with him.

B000002UDB|5.0|I found this album on a cassette without a label, listened to it, loved it, then went on a mission to find the name of the album. i finally did (after emailing virtually everyone i know) and hope to have it for my birthday. I just love it! like people before have said, all the songs are so unique and would be gems by themselves on any other band's album, but to have them altogether is magic. my all time favourite song (so far) is the fool on the hill - i listened to it around italy, so whenever i hear it, i adore the song, and think of people, places and things i saw when it was on - i used up so many batteries rewinding the tape so i could hear it again! it gets to the stage where i stop and rewind it halfway through so it never finishes. enjoy...
B00008GKEG|5.0|Derek Taylor, the Beatles' press officer, has devoted his life in that job to maintaining and revivifying the Beatles myth.  I don't mean that he tells lies about them, or that there's some sordid \\"truth\\" about the Beatles that he seeks to conceal (Albert Goldman, back to your seat!).  I mean that he, more than most other people, has helped to shape the posthumous legend of the Beatles as being some kind of uber-human cultural force - what they themselves referred to as being \\"Fab\\".  His liner notes to these DVDs are in that spirit - you'd think there were almost no other bands during the 60s from the way Taylor writes about this one.  Still and all, he also observes (righteously) that the Beatles were the greatest romance of the 20th century.<br />It's true.  They were, with all the complicated glories implied by that intriguing word \\"romance\\".  Maybe it's the quality of the music, maybe it's the power of the legend, but I always come away from encountering the Beatles feeling like I've just ended a wonderful, intense, electrifying but all-too-brief love affair.  They can make you sad and happy at the same time.  I'm happy that I've heard the songs, sad that there aren't more of them (and that a few of the existing ones aren't even better than they are), regretful that I was born after they split up and never got to see them, glad that they never stayed together and ended up getting old ... (OK, I don't much like \\"Free as a Bird\\", but I notice it's actually been covered by those monsters of rock terror King Crimson, another fave of mine, so there's another point on their card)...I could go on.  Either way, the Beatles have an incredible capacity for making me feel more alive, that no other band has ever come near.  They were the first band I ever liked and they'll always be my favourite.<br />The \\"Anthology\\" series' greatest virtue is also its greatest flaw - that it's told almost entirely by the band itself (Lennon appearing in archive footage or voice-over.)  Wenever get to hear from the women, for example, because Yoko Ono didn't want to take part - imagine what Cynthia Lennon might have contributed! ...Of the fans, almost the only contribution is some old B&W footage of a hapless Cavern denizen named Cathy, who you can see fearing that her beloved lads are being taken away from her - \\"I just want it to be like it was before,\\" she wails, but it was too late even then.  <br />I watched this on British TV when it was first broadcast and it's not quite as great now as it seemed then.  There seems to be an awful lot of not very interesting footage of the band performing \\"All My Loving\\" (never my favourite Beatle song) on some forgotten TV show or other.  But it's balanced by a blistering live performance at the Washington Coliseum, in which the band truly wigs out, plus a generous selection of stuff from the great Shea Stadium film.  (Why isn't it on video?  I remember seeing it telly in the early 70s...)  There's a lovely shot from that show of Brian Epstein, standing near the stage, calmly chewing gum, observing the teenage insanity around him and nodding to himself in quiet satisfaction - yeah, this is pretty much how popular I thought they would be.  <br />As the series goes on, you start to wish that the inevitable won't happen, but of course it does.  They get swamped with acid and produce the gloriously poised \\"Sgt Pepper\\", but from then on it's increasingly tragic; no Beatle of 1964 would let something as dull as \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" or \\"Bungalow Bill\\" onto a proper album.  They'd have saved it for the fan club discs.  And for every three moments of glory in their later work, there are things like the dreary \\"Blue Jay Way\\" or the mean-minded \\"Piggies\\" to be taken into consideration.  The Beatles at their best were so great, that at their worst it's  heartbreaking how ordinary they could be.  Watching scenes from \\"Let It Be\\" in which they bicker about guitar parts (Paul pompous, George sullen, John uninterested) is like overhearing your parents having a row in the next room.  Fortunately they got it together for \\"Abbey Road\\";  but the second side of that album is notably less inspired than the first.  Ringo always kept this band in perfect time, and when they broke up, it was with an immaculate sense of rhythm.  (There used to be a joke that Ringo not only wasn't the best drummer in the world, he wasn't even the best drummer in the Beatles.  But the joke betrays a tin ear. Ringo was in this band because the others knew talent when they heard it.) <br />The coda, in which all four Beatles get to deliver a verdict of sorts, is for me the most touching part of the whole series.  George is typically reflective, remarking on the spiritual and emotional cost of the whole thing to the Beatles themselves.  Paul is just glad it was all done with such a great spirit of love and understanding behind it.  (Granted, Paul, and there's no doubt that \\"Hey Jude\\" is as good as it gets; but please explain \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\".)  John, in what from its slightly defensive tone sounds like an interview from the very early 70s, says that they were just a rock band and breaking up isn't the end of the world - true, but this was no ordinary rock band.  However, in my book Ringo steals the moment, clearly moved as he recalls the deep, private, four-way connection that this band forged during the maddest and hugest career any band ever had.<br />They were the best.  This is a priceless haul of Beatle stuff, more than any but the most rabid fan could ever want.  But there were always generous like that.  Don't worry, lads, you passed the audition.
B00008MNYS|5.0|I have had the UK version of Escapology since November. The two new tracks added to this US version are 'Get a Little High' and 'One Fine Day.'  I previously thought 'Handsome Man' was the best Song on the Album - but it has been superceded by 'One Fine Day.' Look and Listen for Robbie Williams to become famous in the USA! His lyrics are amazing and his songs are awesome. This CD is worth every penny!
B00005M1CO|5.0|I don't listen to metal. I'm not talking Limp Bizkit metal, I'm talking Rhapsody, Iced Earth... I love a few metal songs, but I never thought I'd go buy an entire album. But I did when I listened to Elvenking. This band's metal is so appealing it charmed many people I know who never liked metal before.<br />What may drive people to listen to this music is that it sounds so natural. Each track comes together so nicely it sounds as if the 5 bands members just starting playing and the music came out on its own (but you just know they've worked really hard on this). There is also the mix of clear and deep voices, not to forget women voices at times, that is just incredibly put together. Four people actually sing in the last song, Seasonspeech (they sometimes sing one after another, sometimes together). The first minute of that song will bring tears to your eyes.<br />As for the other songs, they all have lives of their own. Pagan Purity is the most average song on the album, probably because it's the one most ressembling other metal bands. I'm not saying it's bad, it's very good. It's just the one with the less personality. Other tracks worth a mention are Skywards (this one is really slow until the end where it breaks down into one of the greatest song endings), Conjuring of the 14th (that successfully recreates the mood of a horor movie) and A Dreadful Stain (which, for a while, I thought was the worst song on the album. After a couple of hearings, it became one of the best).<br />This album is recommanded to anyone, whether you're a metal fan or not. However, I would recommand a listen first if you are not. Chances are, you'll recognize the genius behind the music. \\"And that's not a bad thing. That's a good thing.\\"
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This film is a wonder.  For one that came and went in a flash from the theaters, its word of mouth and its adoration by most viewers and reviewers is amazing. It is one of those rare films where its ambiguity does not frustrate viewers, but engages them. Is it spiritual, supernatural, metaphysical, romantic, satirical ... ?  Gosh - just about everything.  The characters and the actors who play them are wonderful.  Gyllenhaal is amazing in this and his perfomance invites you to join him on his journey and share his confusion, fear, wonder, angst, lust,and sense romance.  Beautiful filmed and directed  This is a classic that slipped through the cracks before it was really  discovered.
6304806426|3.0|The English Patient is based on Michael Ondaatje's prizewinning novel of love and betrayal before, during and after the Second World War. It recieved almost every award under the sun. A  nurse called Hana played by Juliette Binoch looks after an &quot;English Patient&quot;  played by Ralph Fiennes who has been seriously burnt in a plane crash. Initially, he cannot remember anything - or refuses to do so - but eventually his story and his guilt are revealed. We learn of his love and betrayal.<br />The film diverges in a few places from the novel and is probably a tighter story for the changes. Nonetheless some ofthe changes are just odd and we never learn of Carravagio's past. The cinematography is stunning and the direction is superb, but the whole thing is just lifeless.<br />Even Colin Firth cannot generate anything in this. It has a great cast, superb production values, but for some reason it just leaves you looking at your watch waiting for it all to end.<br />The best scenes are provided by the sapper crew who at least appear to be human. Binoche gives it everything as does every member of the cast, but in the end it does not work.<br />That said, it is staggering beautiful to look at. Some scenes are just breath taking, particularly Binoche in the church as she moved from painting to painting by rope.<br />I admire almost everything about this film, but I just cannot like it.
B00006RIO7|4.0|greatest sountrack of all time maybe like the bodyguard.Catherine voice was amazing,stong,sexy,loud,she can be a singer if she want.<BR>   my favourite:all that jazz,when you're good to mama,class,nowaday,i move on,love is a crime.
B000000JO3|5.0|as i listen to this album i think that i never want to stop. this is a defining album with all the best of minor threat on it. all the kids that tell me that they are into punk and list sum41, averil, good charlotte need to listen to this until their ears bleed.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Being the local rock n' roll kid that I am, I bought &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; and immediately fell in love with it. I learned every song on the guitar, I listened to it to relax, and my whole family fell in love with it. &quot;Elephant&quot; brings whole new feelings. A whole new sound that the reverant and wonderful Jack White stirred out of his mind. It's very simple rock n' roll, but like the last album, it's very inspiring and artistic. Listening to songs like &quot;I Want to Be the Boy to Warm Your Mother's Heart&quot; and &quot;I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself&quot; make you think that Jack's singing a whole new language. Songs like &quot;Hypnotize&quot; bring back the same feel that &quot;Fell In Love With a Girl&quot; brought. I HIGHLY recommend this album.
0812550706|5.0|Great author, great characters, great story. This is one of my all-time favorite books, and people of all ages will love it! People say that science-fiction books are about aliens, spaceships, in-space battle wars...well, for this book it's true. It's not your typical everyday story though. You may be used to stories about heroic characters going on a mission, coming home victorious with people loving and surrounding him/her. Well, the hero of THIS story just wants to stay with his beloved sister Valentine -- but he can't. Ender Wiggin is sent to space around the age of six to train to become one of the most famous commanders of the military. <br />I know what you're thinking, and you're right. Pure child prodigy. Actually, the entire school where he trains at is full of them; military geniuses, of course. Ender just happens to be the smartest of them all. Others resent him for it and are willing to hurt, or even kill him, to bring him down. The teachers won't help at all, and believe this will help him save the world. Ender just knows that if he's able to pull this off he can go home.<br />I'm going to stop talking now! If you look at the better written reviews above and below me, you will see that this is a GREAT book. I've read it again and again, and it only gets better the more you read it.
B000060P79|5.0|I'd Do Anything - this song is simple plan's first single .Good song, teen-ish lyrics about doing anything just to get a girl, and features Mark Hoppus for about 2 seconds. 5 of 5<br />The Worst Day Ever - another good song which is a good way to end I'd Do Anything. Lyrics are kinda weird, sounds like he hates his life, but the sound of the song makes it the opposite. 5 of 5<br />You Don't Mean Anything - One of my favorite songs on the album. Very good lyrics if you feel like making a girl understand that you dont like them. Great guitars and backing vocals by Good Charlotte. 6 of 5<br />I'm Just a Kid - Lyrics are eh, talks about how none of his friends wanna hang out with him. Starts off slow, then explodes into guitars. 4 of 5<br />When I'm With You - Eh, this song is most likely to be skipped most of the time. I dont like the guitars and the lyrics. Its an ok POP song though. 2 of 5<br />Meet You There - Another favorite of mine. Slow song, but GREAT singing by Pierre. He's just amazing with his voice. awesome lyrics and not much guitar but i like it. 5 of 5<br />Addicted - This song is Simple Plan's second single. I started cracking up because of the lyrics. ... Kind of a medium tempo song. Once again, GREAT singing by Pierre. 4 of 5<br />My Alien - Eh..the lyrics are kind of [bad]. Talks about how a girl relates to an alien and [stuff]. The beginning of the song is ok, starts out with a Blink 182-ish type solo, then into some good guitars. 3 of 5<br />God Must Hate Me - Good guitars,slow/fast song,  lyrics are about how his life is coincidently always getting bad and Pierre, its not cuz God hates you. God loves everyone :)....4 of 5<br />I Won't Be There - Another song i would always skip. Its an ok song, but it sounds very similar to other songs on the album, and the lyrics arent too suprising. Its a pretty fast punk/pop song. 3 of 5<br />One Day - Finally, the only song where Simple Plan uses some acoustic guitars. Lyrics arent too great, it is , once again, about his [bad] life and how ONE DAY he wont take it. Starts out with punkish acoustic solos, and then in the chorus, some electric pops in. 4 of 5<br />Perfect - MY FAVORITE SONG ON THE ALBUM!!! This song starts off slow, and explodes into some hard rock. Only punk i see in this song is Pierre's voice, otherwise, its AWESOME. Lyrics are also to his dad, and how he cant live a perfect life and hes sorry. GREAT SONG. 100 of 5 (if possible)<br />Grow Up (Bonus) - Song from the scooby-doo soundtrack. I could tell this song was made before Pierre's voice grew a little mature. Good song, great guitars, and lyrics are about how he doesnt ever wanan grow up, so people should stop telling him to.4 of 5<br />My Christmas List (Bonus) - This song is secretly hidden after about 50 seconds after Grow Up ends. A christmas song, good guitars, [bad] lyrics about what he wants for christmas and santa. A fast song. 3 of 5
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park has done it again.  They have made another awesome cd.  I loved all the songs on the first cd and on Reanimation and I can not find a single song that I don't like on Meteora.  Anyone who already loves Linkin Park, you will love this.  If you haven't joined the club, Linkin Park is the best and you will love them.  They have a one of a kind sound to their songs and every one is different.  Go Linkin Park.  Are you ready??
B000005IS1|5.0|Have a lust for intense, brash and violently loud rock? Have a taste for rebellion and chaos? Have a taste for things that represent the gut of rock n' roll? Look no further than this brash juggernaut of an album.... Armed with a defiant aesthetic, they (and Brother J.C. Crawford) take the listener on a wild, brash and freewheeling sonic trip to a time when sex, drugs, rock n' roll and total debauchery was the order of the day. Let all your worries, fears and everyday concerns disappear while you listen to the loose, passionate and carefree atmosphere brought on by vocalist Rob Tyner and company. Have a laugh or two when you hear Brother J.C. Crawford's provocative speeches (for some reason, his speeches always crack me up a bit), but most of all, get lost in the soulful, chaotic, rebellious energy, and feel as if you can take on the world - like these guys did. This album represents 60s rebellion of the highest order. Want punk? Put this on,... But most of all, if you wan't pure, intense and unbridled energy to get your adrenaline up everytime, you MUST own this. This is the essence of rock n' roll. And remember - PLAY IT AS LOUD AS POSSIBLE!
B000084T18|4.0|It is a well made album but the only reason I will not give it 5 stars is because many of the songs are annoying to me now. There are also too many radio-friendly songs on the album and not enough gritty songs for my taste. My favorite songs are:<br />Patiently Waiting<BR>Many Men (Wish Death)<BR>Heat (My Favorite Song on the cd)<BR>If I Can't (His next single)<BR>Blood Hound<BR>Back Down<BR>Don't Push Me<BR>Wanksta<BR>U Not Like Me<BR>Life's On Da Line<br />If you don't alrady have the album, you need to get it NOW!!<BR>Look for \\"The New Breed\\" April 15 and G-Unit at the end of 2003
B000089RVX|3.0|I heard this CD at a Virgin Store nearby, and I was pretty impressed. Nice vocals, good melody, WHAT?! these riffs sound EXACTLY like the ones Linkin Park uses. Well, they [took] that from Linkin Park, but the rest of it sounds OK. I'm not a big fan of this band, and I haven't listened to the whole CD so I'm not going to judge too much. All I'll say is that in my opinion, they're trying to copy Linkin Park in a way, except not rapping in it. But I could be wrong, I haven't heard all of the CD, so take a listen for yourself.
6304602979|5.0|Quentin Tarantino wrote the script for this 1993 film. It set the stage for his career in pushing the envelope a lot further than the audience ever expects.  There's energy here and a fast paced story that grabbed me right from the beginning and never let up.  There's also humor and lots of violence.  My kind of film.<br />Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the couple at the film's center.  He's an Elvis fan and comic book freak who loves martial arts films.  She's been working as a call girl for only four days and is sent by his boss to show the boy a good time.  However, they fall in love, get married and then he goes gunning for her pimp.  All of a sudden they're in possession of a suitcase full of cocaine.  Then they drive to Los Angeles where they hope to sell it and live happily every after.<br />Not so fast.  The mob is on their trail.  Christopher Walken plays the gangster who tries to get information as to the couple's whereabouts from Dennis Hopper, who is cast as Slater's father.  James Gandolfini is a hit man and has a bloody scene with Patricia Arquette later.  Brad Pitt has a small role as a stoned out friend of Michael Rappaport who is helping the couple sell the drugs. And Tom Sizemore is a cop.  Naturally things get complicated.  People get bloody and battered. But \\"true romance\\" constantly prevails between the couple.<br />Once I started watching this film, I literally didn't move from my seat as I was entirely focused on the screen that was exploding with action.  The dialog was terrific.  And so was the acting.  O.K. - maybe it wasn't realistic or plausible.  But who had time to stop and think about it?  Certainly not me.  I just relaxed and enjoyed.  And isn't that what the experience of a good film is all about.<br />There weren't any good extras on the DVD and that was disappointing.  I would have liked to learn more about this film in depth.  However, \\"True Romance\\" certainly does stand alone in its own right.  I give it one of my highest recommendations.ighest recommendations.
B00006RU5B|5.0|To put it very simply... if the U.S. is a military and political superpower, then Audioslave is a rock superpower.  Long live rock!
B000005RSW|2.0|I love manowar.  They are among my favorite bands.<br />This, however, is by FAR their weakest album.  Sure, there's some catchy lyrics and riffs.  Some of the songs are quite good.  But overall, it's just weak.<br />I see Manowar's music progression in 3 stages.<BR>1.  Into Glory Ride &amp; Battle Hymns - the original sound.  Raw, full of emotion and vinegar.  Awesome, awesome work, if it is more than a bit dated now.<BR>2.  Sign of the Hammer and Hail to England - their weakest 2 albums.  The sound is more 'metalic', partially due to the prodution.  Sure, the musicanship is outstanding, but the songs are overly cheesy, and they sound 'thin', with no depth of music.<BR>3.  Fighting the World --&gt; and on.  -  About Fighting the World, the lyrics are still cheesy, but the music is *thick* with layers, the lyrics are well delivered, and it is good, good metal.<br />Of all the albums, Sign of the Hammer is the 'weakest link', but it's sister album (Hail to England) is a close 2nd.  Still, if you're a fan of Manowar, it's worth having in your collection.
B00008H2LB|5.0|When I got this album I was astounded.  I have Hybrid Theory and Reanimation, and this one is just wonderful.  The songs are all very well performed and they are just what I needed to hear.  On this album, the best songs would have to be Figure.09 and Numb.  Those two songs are the best on this CD, and if you are already a LP fan and you haven't got this yet, get it now!! If you're new to LP, this is a wonderful album, as it explores many different styles.  If you like rock and rap, LP is just what you have been praying for.  Wonderful album.  Good job guyz!!
B00004TRD8|1.0|I have gotten two copies of this DVD, and both have had the same problems. On certain scenes, the DVD will go back and repeat the previous scene and get stuck in an endless loop unless you skip the scene entirely. Meaning there are some scenes you don't even get to see! I recommmend getting the regular version of the DVD and not the &quot;Ultimate&quot; edition. The extra material really isn't all that good anyway.

0784011710|5.0|From a totally penetrating and naked display of emotions, to her effortless narration of German prose, or the very convincingly affectuated Polish accent, this may be one of Streep's most outstanding performances ever! 'Sophie's Choice' should be compulsory viewing for any member of the voting panel who decides Academy Award winners. Quite simply, Meryl Streep's performance is THE benchmark for that 'Best Actress' category. I've seen a lot of films and not one performance has ever (or perhaps will ever) equal her's. The manner in which she embodies Sophie is beyond scrutiny, it is too accomplished and moving for words.<br />Sophie is a person who is naive, jaded, innocent, guilt stricken, soft and gentle, hard as nails, loving and giving, and both practical and poetic to a fault. She is a classic tragic figure, a lesson in how to deal with the horrors of life and how not to deal with how those horrors haunt you. She is funny, soft and sweet, and you want to put your arms around her. Then you realize that underneath that childlike woman is a woman who has given up on childhood. She is a study in contradictions, speaking English, German, and Polish to survive at all costs. Then along comes Nathan, expertly portrayed by Kevin Kline (possibly one of his most challenging and multi-layered roles), and her life takes another turn.<br />But we see all this through the wondering, innocent eyes of Stingo (Peter MacNicol), and the terror, love, laughs, friendship and alienation he experiences, that we experience.<br />Aside from Streep's breathtaking pivotal performance, there are so many other reasons to own, collect and cherish this film -- Kevin Kline and Peter MacNicol in their once in a lifetime role (I bet you cannot imagine anybody other than MacNicol who could portray Stingo like he does!), the beautiful cinematography, the haunting score which I realized was never overly touching or pretentiously dramatic....and yes, the key scene -- The Choice of Choices -- is possibly the most poignant scene ever on film, and how Meryl interprets Sophie during this scene is, by itself, worth an award! I loved this movie.<br /><br />All I can say to sum up is: required viewing! An intelligent and profoundly moving film that will (I promise you) live on in your memory long after the closing credits.ly the most poignant scene ever on film, and how Meryl interprets Sophie during this scene is, by itself, worth an award!

B00008H2LB|5.0|Great album. I'm not sure if its better than hybrid theory though, there are many differences. look at song ratings below.<br />Foreward-just noise skip this track.<br />Don't stay-Great way to start off the album,amazing.10/10<br />Somewhere I Belong- Good single. great intro. great chorus. great verses. great. but may be one of the worst songs on the album.10/10<br />Lying from you- amazing. what i was expecting on the album. its got a cool egiptian beat in it too. 10/10<br />Hit the floor- great song, its the hardest one on the album.10/10<br />Easier to run-This is definite next single, possible next big hit for LP. 12/10<br />Faint- most genuis song on the album. Cmon? violins? thats great. 10/10<br />Figure.09- THis song is differnt but its really good and has a hard tone.not one of my favorites but good.10/10<br />Breaking the habit- One of linkin parks best songs ever. my favorite one on the album. im not sure if it could be a single because it isnt a normal lp song. its a fast pace non hard rock song and has a soft guitar. 15/10<br />From the Inside- great song, kind of like easier to run but is original. 10/10<br />Nobody's listening- almost pure hip-hop. mike has great rapping on this one. chester makes a good chorus. if u only like linkin park for their hard rock u want like this one. 10/10<br />Session- Same thing a cure for the itch but i like cure for the itch more even though i never listen to this its still kind of cool. 8/10<br />Numb- another one of my favorites. people say he sounds different but he sounds the sam. duh? 10/10<br />I cant get this cd out of my cd player, its mad good. if u liked hybrid theory, get this!!
B00000JZJ0|5.0|When I started my horror collection on dvd i had to have The Re-Animator saga(Re-Amimator, Bride of, and From Beyond). But they only had Re-Animator on DVD. But after a long awaited period it here. If you liked the first one you\\"ll like this one. Now we need From Beyond! I can not wait tell the next installment, Beyond Re-Animator!!!...
B000002UJQ|5.0|It took me four years to get into Radiohead. For the casual radio victim (like myself in 95') this album can be rather obtuse and difficult to digest. If you don't see what all the hype is about, actually listen to all the tracks in order and (here's an idea) concentrate while you're listening to them. This has become the best record I've ever heard. I've searched earnestly for better music, but this is it and it does not dissappoint. It will inevitably hit you as it eventually hit me, but when it comes be prepared for a total mind-kcuf.<br />Brilliant.
B000089RVX|4.0|Amy Lee has an amazing voice, i like the dark side of the songs. But this girls vocals are great, this band is here to stay. Also i recomemend to check out the band 12 stones which vocalist sings with Amy on the song bring me to life. This band Rocks!!!
B000001EAQ|4.0|First and foremost, as a drummer I looked at this album as an accomplishment for Larry. The complicated beats and the hard pounding snare was much gone from the last 2 albums. Lyrically, this album is intense. Bono's lyrics are honest, ironic and direct. I remember reading the reviews before the album came out. They applauded the album; however, as soon as it started to flop they dismissed it out of that.<br />Discotheque  - A song full of fun. Like chewing bubble gum. <br />Do You Feel Loved - Heavy Distortion from the Drums and Guitar. <br />Mofo - Bono's most honest and upfront song. Once again, heavy distortion and drumming.<br />If God Will Send His Angels - Clever song. We see honesty through sharp critism for the way society is today.<br />Staring At The Sun - This song got a lot of air play. I found it irritating after a while. However, after seeing it live, it grew on me. <br />Last Night On Earth - Everyone agrees that this is a great song. Lyrically & musically. Sounds great live and blasted through the speakers.<br />Gone - Same as above. Musically a lot better. Though LNOE tells a much complete story. One of the highlights of the album.<br />Miami - This song is like acid jazz on crack. LoL Complicated musically, yet ironic and satirical lyrically. Living in Miami, I found this song to be very true. Many found this as a weak track. However, living here I found it to be quite a bashing treat.<br />Playboy Massion - A song mocking the social news and dilemmas of society. I liked the playfulness in the beat and its tone.<br />If You Wear That Velvet Dress - Perhaps U2's 2 or 3 most sensual songs. Lyrical teaser and seductive in it bass lines and guitar picking.<br />Please - This song is just amazing. The acid jazz beat and the drumming is just amazing. Add the sentimental honest lyrics and this song is a highlight. I have the CD Single and I love both versions they made. It sounds spectacular.<br />Wake Up Dead Man - This song is so intense and in your face it's just amazing. It is just RAW. Bono battles some of his issues with Jesus.<br />Overall, for an album that's half done it is just great. Fine, this album is not as tight as the previous albums or the one's that follow. However, that's just fine. The pure RAW / unfinished elements that make album miss is what make it a masterpiece. Asides from Zooropa and Passengers this is an album with different textures. It takes a few listens for it to grow on you, but when it does you feel and hear why.
B00008MNYS|5.0|I've heard both versions of &quot;Escapology&quot; Hint: The full album can be heard on Robbie's website. Both versions are unbelievable. Buy &quot;Escapology&quot; right this minute, do you hear! You won't be disappointed. America wake up. You're missing something really special. Robbie is one of the most talented people on earth right now. His voice is soulful, his music is memorable and his lyrics are thoughtful. If that weren't enough, he has the body of a Greek g-d and enough charm for 10 men. Oh that I were about 30 years younger. Alas, I'm old enough to be his grandmother. I first heard that voice during the closing credits of &quot;Bridget Jones's Diary&quot; and wondered who was singing &quot;Have You Met Miss Jones?&quot;  I was so captivated, I searched the Internet and bought &quot;I've Been Expecting You.&quot; I'm totally blown away by his music. He's a healthy young lad who's  taking full advantage of what the fates have brought him. All of us can live precariously through Robbie's great good fortune in Escapology, but Robbie also shows us that there are dangers and hypocrisy  too. He's no fool, this Robbie. He's obviously got a good head on his shoulders. He may have his demons, but something tells me he'll be okay in the end. It gives me chills to think what he will bring us in the future. I can't wait.
B00005JLEU|4.0|I will start with why I gave the movie 4 stars. It ended abruptly, I mean, I understood the whole part of her learning respect, and manners, and how to live life. I understood all the moral values of everything. But... The fact that everyone got to love her and was happy to see her go. That wierded me out, I mean, aren't they all evil and such. Don't they hate humans. That could have been explained better. I suppose. But, theres not more I can say than that.<br />This movie was excellent...This movie for starters was rather graphic. There was blood, and references to death and a single cigarette but sorry conservative parents that doesn't mean its PG-13. It's PG. There is a difference between PG and G and I hope now all of you realize that you cannot take a 5-year-old to a PG movie. That lesson having been learned, the parents no longer need to put down the movie for showing blood. PG movies tend to have some references to death and in this day and age also have violence and blood. <br />Next on my negative attacks is the fact that this movie wasn't up to Oscar status. Look, the artwork was excellent, the story was beautiful, the plot was great, the scenery and worlds were mystical and entertaining, the characters were unique and fun. Just because your son/daughter did not sit through it doesn't mean it isn't Oscar worthy. Notice the Oscar was for best Animation and not best Child's Movie. Thank you.<br />The Artwork was so good on this movie. I would glance at my friend next to me and we could only laugh with glee at how beautiful it all was, or the similarities between this and the directors other famous filmed Princess Mononoke. I'm slightly disappointed that they felt the need to ad CG (computer generations) to the film. They disappointed me only because it shows they got lazy, they easily could have pulled those scenes off with mere animated art.<br />This movie was not just a kid's movie, but if you aren't a fan of Anime and want to check it out because it's an Oscar winner, than don't get your hopes up. Anime is like Coffee to a kid, you just gotta get used to it before you love it. An acquired taste. It's really an excellent film, the dub wasn't horrible, I'm sure there were some edits, but it was chopped, it was beautiful the way I saw it in theatres. It was excellent and it is a must see for most Anime fans and Children over 8 sounds like a healthy age.<br />Well, having purchased the movie today.  The day it has come out, I noticed something under \\"The Art of Spirited Away\\" featurette, that some people may find interesting.  Sadly this is what happens when the world thinks it knows everything about movies.  Sadly, some people don't quite understand the things that go on in the backround and just because it says Disney on it means its gonna [stink.]  I mean honestly, look at all the over protective and unimaginative parents that hate it!  That is one of the most appealing things to it that most defintely shows that it isn't Disney.  The featurette I watched explained the situation of Studio Ghibli (Miyazaki's laboratory for animation) on the distribution of their works in America.  Miyazaki refused to sell his work to anyone unless it came, and I quote \\"fully uncut in it's entirety\\".  No, this is not diet-Miyazaki.  This film was not Disney-fide.  What you saw was the true version of the film translated into English.  If that puts you in too much of a hard situation to listen to your own native language, I'm sorry, just go jump off a cliff.  I too enjoy the original language tracks, but trust me, nothing was changed.  And, guess what that means.  Mononoke wasn't changed either...
B00008972S|5.0|i had the honor of seeing west side story on broadwaY 5 times with carol lawrence, chita rivera and larry kert! i saw this great film at least 10 times in it's initial roadshow release aND i'm so thrilled with this marvelous new dvd! it looks and sounds better than it ever has before. my only problem-someone help me here now, please--asap! how do i choose the option on disc one-the film- to play with the intermission music included! it is and was always such a strong piece of music-no matter what i search no matter what i do-i don't find this option as is listed here and on the dvd box! if anyone here has unlocked the secret please e mail me asap. thanks.......robert
0446608955|5.0|WOW!<BR>I was in complete and utter shock, and I thought the movie was good- This is NOTHING compared to the movie, it has a mix of everything for PICKY readers. WARNING you will need to keep a box of tissue nearby! I was blown away at how descripitive \\"Sparks\\" was upon writing this book, it makes u belive in faith, love, belief, tragedy, and how dreams do actually come true!
B0000025P9|5.0|Toto is one of the most underated bands in the world. They are still together and making some of the most well-crafted rock/pop out there. Toto IV swept the Grammys when it came out and deservedly so. Never has there been a more perfect song than &quot;Rosanna.&quot; Jeff Porcaro's drum groove is instantly recognizable and unique. David Paich's piano work is unparalled. Steve Lukather is one of the finest guitarists on the planet, now and forever. Don't overlook the genius of this band based on the merits of a few soft rock hits like &quot;Africa&quot; and &quot;I'll Be Over You.&quot; Every Toto album has hidden gems of outstanding songwriting ability and music arrangements par excellence! Get the whole collection. There's not a terrible album in the bunch.
B00006AW2L|5.0|Thank God... thank god. I can finally own a good sounding copy of this album, with all the tracks in stereo, at the correct speed, etc... <br />Yes, Allen Klein is still a schuyster, and I can't believe the boys actually did business with him again, but still, I am grateful to be able to replace what was unquestionably the worst-sounding disc in their catalog (the only possible exception being Hot Rocks II) with a fresh new version.
B00005Q4CS|3.0|I found Requiem for a Dream to be a tad overrated, but still interesting to watch.<br />If anything, it teaches that Poverty creates crime, and NOT that drugs are inherently evil. If the person who wrote the script for this made it solely to spew out anti-Drug propaganda for 90 minutes, then shame on them...but I'm not going to speculate the true intentions from the start.<br />For those that aren't easily (or ever, for that matter) offended, I suggest you check the movie out and see it for yourself.
B000056VJ7|5.0|In an age of disingenuous noise that passes for feeling, Meatloaf shows what it means to MEAN a song. Like a terrified surfer who fears the end of a wave, he sings within a heartbeat of a heart-attack during the crest of each movement. At the troughs, he demonstrates such feeling and vulnerability that you will have to believe his previous passion.<BR>     I remember thinking in my early years that Joe Cocker and Robert Plant could sing as though their lives depended on it. And Janis.......just damn! Meatloaf picks up on that. <BR>     I bought this CD for the usual reason - Paradise By The Dashboard Light - and God knows I'd heard the other songs a million times. But when you can can sit down and quit listening and start appreciating a work of art, all the rules change. I started to appreciate the performance potential of Meatloaf and the writing ability of Jim Steinman. I had always known Meatloaf had the &quot;feel&quot; for hard-core blues-rock but infinite repetitions of a work highlight nuances like the radio never could.<BR>     If you're looking for what God meant when he allowed the term &quot;Classic Rock&quot;  to be created - buy the CD. But if you're looking for a religious experience, just remember, &quot;There ain't no Coup de'ville in the bottom of a Cracker Jack Box&quot;. <BR>     Phil Rizzuto does a play-by-play on the teenaged lust-quest &quot;Paradise By The Dashboard Light&quot; and subsequent interviews had him saying he felt tricked into doing something he didn't realize he was doing. Phil, this soundtrack of you will outlast any game you ever dreamed of. Thanks for the background, dude. It was freaking classic.<BR>    &quot;What's it gonna be boy...?&quot;<BR>    &quot;I never knew how the fire could be burning on the edge of the icefield...&quot;<BR>     Talk about hard and fast to soft and vulnerable, Meatloaf has a range that amazes. Jim Steinman was born to write for such an emotional artist. Just listen to this and imagine anyone else doing it. <BR>       Janis would be proud, for cryin' out loud.<BR>    An album who wants to be an all time classic has to meet certain conditions. Timelessness, passion, originality. Two outta three AIN'T bad - but with this disc, three outta three is better. <BR>    Hear me or ignore me. If I present truth as you see it, know that I understand. But if you see me as full of horse hooey, then &quot;...like a sinner before the gates of heaven, I'll come crawling on back to you.&quot; <BR>     It just does NOT cost that much to buy the disc. If you don't like it, you can at least make most of your money back off a friend selling it to them. And they'll be glad you did.
B0000028M7|5.0|Alice In Chains' second album, Dirt, is a harrowing listen, which only gets more haunting with every listen. It's almost like Joy Division's \\"Closer,\\" since the topics are very macabre and depressing (death, drug addiction, and the ode to Vietnam \\" Rooster\\"). Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell were amazing vocalists, who wrapped this album with very pensive lyrics and emotional vocals, and their vocal harmonies can be compared to Lennon and McCartney, or even Simon and Garfunkel, and it was probably unheard of for a 'metal' band to do that. <br />It is a very difficult album to stomach, snce it clocks in at about 58 minutes, and it is reminiscent of Seattle's raint atmopshere (which undoubtedly influenced the genre's muddy sounding music), though the amount of melody and passion is enough to draw one to this album. Songs like \\"Angry Chair,\\" \\"Would?\\" \\"Them Bones\\" \\"Down In a Hole\\" and \\"Rain When I Die\\" are grunge classics (along with the aforementioned \\"Rooster\\"), and hasn't gotten the credit it deserves, since it lies in the shadow of Pearl Jam and Nirvana. Now with Layne gone, the vocals in many of the songs are really haunting, and make the album even sadder. As he said \\"I feel so alone, gonna end up a big old pile of them bones.\\" Strangely prophetic lyrics. Definitely the darkest album of the 1990s. Only a few bands can top its overwhelming amount of gloom.
B00008GKEG|5.0|The Extra Disk alone makes this set worth the price by adding the Real Love video that the VHS set left out. Sound is incredible also.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|My daughters love Beauty and the beast. I bought this for them three days ago and they are still loving it. They love seeing the different versions of the story. This is one children's DVD that even my husband can sit through.
0140120416|1.0|This book has to be the worst grammar/language book I have ever read! This is coming from someone who has learned two other foreign languages.<br />This book is horrible. You don't even learn plural noun forms until a few chapters into the book. Then they make you wait until the chapter on the genitive case to find out the adjective forms for these plural nouns!<br />A lot of good this will do someone who wants to communicate with Russians right away.<br />Granted Russian is a tough language: there are 6 different cases to learn and lots of exceptions to rules. However, the way this book is laid out and organized only makes it harder!<br />I know because I have found a few web pages that teach Russian more effectively than this.
0399226907|5.0|My kids love this book. It is a cute story with even cuter pictures. This book has helped my son learn to count, and my daughter just loves the bright colors. This is one of my all time favorite children's books.
0440237688|4.0|The Giver by Lois Lowry, was a refreshing change in reality.  This young adult novel is about a boy named Jonas, who lives in a \\"perfect\\" world. But soon Jonas finds out the world is not so perfect. I liked this story, it was fun and easy reading.  The Giver allows a person to leap into their imagination and see the world in a different way.  I recommend this book for young and old readers.  The Giver is a unique and powerful novel.
B00000DLUV|4.0|I do. As a trio, these brothers wrote tons! I mean, they get my vote just for that. Beyond that admiration, I like their music, well, most of it, and this CD is a quick paced movement through a lot of their best stuff. I watched the special on TV a few times, and enjoyed that as well. I finally figured out what they were saying in How Deep Is Your Love!(I still can't belive that Maurice has died.) Although Robyn tends to get on my nerves a bit, Barry is still as fab as ever, with that lions mane and his voice still hanging in there. This is just a fun CD for anyone who likes a bit of easy-listening, a great pick-me-up for the home commute!
B00004R996|4.0|An enchanting product of the Good Neighbor policy with Latin America, Saludos Amigos gives viewers a nostalgic trip back. The film chronicles the good will tour Walt Disney and his animators made to Latin America in  1941. Footage of Walt and company on their trip tie the four cartoons that make up this feature (Lake Titicaca staring Donald Duck, Pedro, El Gaucho Goofy, and Aquarela do Brasil). The four cartoons are cleaver and very well done in the Disney tradition, staring existing Disney favorites such as Donald Duck and Goofy, and new characters such as Pedro the airplane and Jose Carioca (the last of which would go on to appear with Donald in two other features during the 1940s). However, it is truly the live action at the artists finding inspiration that elevates the film to more than just a collection of four shorts. Also included with the film is a travelogue entitled \\"South of the Boarder with Walt Disney\\" which includes even more footage of Disney and company and their travels in South America. To any Disney fan, this is a hidden gem and a nostalgic treasure.
B00005JKG7|5.0|This movie, following up John and Debris first, and my favorite movie Halloween is outstanding! The plot revolves around a small California coast town about to celebrate their 100th annoversary when all of a sudden a secret is unconvered reaviling the terrifying past of the town to some of the townspeople and whats soon going to happen to them. The details of what they learned are too long to explain, but on the night before the 100th birthday and the night of it, a strange mysterious fog wraps itslef around the town killing random people. Its now up to a disc jockey, a native of the town, a hitchhiker(jamie lee curtis), a priest, the mayor(janet leigh), and her assistant to try to survive this terrifying night and to correct history!<br /> This movie had everything you want in it; a good cast, good plot, great picture and sound quality, and a great director to back it all up! This movie was both horror and slight comedy mixed together creating the pefect blend and I love all the subliminal things that John put into it! For example Jamie lee curtiss says that shes not that lucky, that funny because of her last role in Halloween. The other thing was that the native, the man who picked Jamie up in his car, said that his name was Nick Castle, Thats cool becuase that was the actors name who played Michael Myers in Halloween!<br /> The special features were very good featuring original trailers from the theatres and TV, still shots, (two)cast interviews and biographies about the movie one from 1980 and one just made for the DVD, and a directors commentary by John Carpenter and Debri Hill.<br /> So if you want to watch a scary movie by yourslef or with a group of people then turn off the lights, shut your doors and watch: The Fog!

B00005JL0I|4.0|Eon Production's DR. NO was a great hit in the early 1960s, and Eon quickly snapped up the rights to the rest of Ian Flemming's novels about super spy James Bond--except for the CASINO ROYALE, which had already been purchased earlier by CBS for a 1950s television adaptation.  When the property wound up at Columbia Pictures, they decided to create the satire to end all satires with a host of writers, five famous directors, and an all-star cast led by Peter Sellers.  But Sellers' ego reached critical mass during the production and he was fired mid-way into filming--and suddenly roles that were originally envisioned as cameos had to be expanded to finish the project.  The result is one of the most bizarre films imaginable.  The story, such as it is, finds James Bond (David Niven) called out of retirement to deal with the sudden disappearance of secret agents all over the world.  In order to confuse the unknown enemy, Sir James orders ALL secret agents to use the name James Bond--and before you can blink there are Bonds aplenty running wild all over the globe. Eventually all the Bonds, including (through the magic of editing) Peter Sellers, wind up at Casino Royale, where they confront the evil agents of SMERSH and a diabolical mad man with a plot to rule the world.<br />The plot is absolute chaos, but that doesn't prevent the film from being a lot of fun to watch. The entire cast runs wild with some marvelous over-the-top performances, and whenever the writers can jam in a gag or a weird plot turn they do precisely that: Bond (Niven) is attacked by decoy ducks; counter-agent Mimi (Deborah Kerr) swings from a drain pipe; Bond's daughter by Mata Hari (Joanna Pettet) is kidnapped by a UFO; double agent Vesper (Ursula Andress) hides bodies in the deep freeze.  And that's just for starters.<br />At one point Niven blows up the locked door of a psychedelically decorated dudgeon with lysergic acid--better know as LSD--and in a way this is indicative of the entire film, which was made at the height of the 1960s ultra-mod movement: the whole thing has the feel of a blow-out acid trip, right down to flashing multicolored lights and swinging 60s fashions.  It is visually arresting, to say the least.  And then there is that famous Burt Bacharach score, easily one of the best of the decade, sporting Herp Albert on the main theme and Dusty Springfield's legendary performance of \\"The Look of Love.\\"  On the whole, the film is one of the most entertaining hodgepodges of talent and weirdness I've ever encountered, and it never fails to amuse.  As for the DVD itself, the print is good and the sound is too.  The extras are a bit disappointing, however.  The original CBS version, included here, is a bore, and the making-of documentary is essentially a prolonged interview with one the film's several directors.  I've found that viewers tend to have extremely different reactions to this film--they either love it or hate it, so you may want to rent this one first.  But it's one of my favorite guilty pleasures, and I recommend it for fans of the unexpectedly odd.was made at the height of the 1960s ultra-mod movement: the whole thing has the feel of a blow-out acid trip, right down to flashing multicolored lights and swinging 60s fashions.

0375703764|1.0|This book is bad.  It's long and never takes you anywhere.  There is no monster, no climax, no nothing.  The appeal in the book is the way its written and a promise of a very creative and  interesting story (text in all sorts of weird formats), but the story is virtualy nonexistent which makes it a waste to read despite the creative layout.  Again, there is no event just a house that is huge and full of absolutely nothing.  Don't waste your time or money.  There are many other good books I could have read instead...
0060012218|5.0|A theme of discovery runs through Brent Hartinger's Geography Club, just like explorers discovering a new land. So the book and the club that five high school students start at their high school is appropriately named, too. And even though the Geography Club doesn't have anything to do with geography, since the gay and lesbian students who started it didn't want others to join, it has everything to do with a kind of map to understanding what it's like to be a gay kid in a typical high school, or an outcast. Hartinger brilliantly captures the voice of his teen age protagonist and story teller. He also captures the heart and mind of the reader. You don't have to be gay to learn something from this book; what that is, I will leave to each reader. I think it has a lot to do with who you are and the geography of your own mind. --Ronald L. Donaghe...

B00006LLNU|5.0|Today was one of those days when I was grateful to be alive.  The crisp sun, the forest, the Flon Morand with its little waterfall, my doggie, and Sigur Ros playing in my head.  A sublimely beautiful moment.<br />The music is ethereal and substantial, calming and uplifting.  It is harmony-with-nature.  It is ahimsaa.<br />The fact that the vocals are not in any tongue I understand - language as pure sound - only enhaces the mystic pleasure one gets from that voice.<br />It is no wonder that Thom Yorke has &quot;noticed&quot; Sigur Ros.<br />So.  Thank you.  Thank you for helping to make a moment so beautifully sublime.
B000002MU3|5.0|To the casual observer, Monster would appear to be a complete about-turn from the baroque nostalgia of Automatic for the People. The out-of-focus and rough edged pop-art sleeve. The electric guitars. In fact, at least as far back as Green, they were rocking out with 'Turn you inside out' that would have fitted in perfectly on Monster. And what Bono called the greatest country record never made (Automatic)- itself a thematic offshoot from Out of Time's 'Country Feedback' - had a fair few twists and distortions- the song Star Me Kitten bearing the tame title of what they had originally intended. So REM were doing what they had always done- creating a weird evolution and a worthy, arty addition to their impressive catalogue with Warners. Monster, rooted in the haziness of both the louche 70s and the indie 90s, seemed like a merging of both Nirvana's raw, disaffected anger and U2's new arch postmodernism. Frankly speaking, this was the first REM album you could get drunk to and it seethes with adolescent sexuality in a fuzz of guitars and twisted songs about love, sex ... and death. Let Me In is written about Kurt Cobain and the album dedicated to the late River Phoenix. And even what might sound like Everybody Hurts Part 2 (Strange Currencies) seems more disturbing when its opening line about two lovers talking on the telephone follows the song 'Star 69'. 'You will be mine' sounds more like a stalker's threat than an expression of love. <BR>        The opening track 'What's the frequency, Kenneth?', to me, almost seems to say 'Do you know what's going on? Do you REALLY know where we're coming from?' to the muddled masses who only knew REM as a charming quartet who spun out 'Losing my religion' and 'Everybody Hurts.' It's a classic and one of their best songs on any album. Ambiguity, an REM trademark, is given free reign on this album, in a sea of distortion on such tracks as King of Comedy, with the robotically voiced lead singer and Tongue, with Stipe doing falsetto.Dreams have always featured prominently on REM's albums and this IS REM's dream album- sometimes a wet dream such as I Don't Sleep, I Dream and sometimes a nightmare such as You. Its' accompianment piece, New Adventures in Hi-Fi, would later take the template of Monster, remove some of the sharp edges, stetch it and add a dash of Automatic for the People.  <BR>      This album will not appeal to everyone. It probably won't be your most listened to REM album. For all its' loud rocking nature, this album is as darkly introspective and intriguing as anything REM have done. REM made an album to play with your head as well as your mind.
B00005JLSE|5.0|chiCago, what can i say this has to be one of the best movies of all time. Not only does it have an all-star cast it has great musical numbers but it was nominated for 13 Oscars! <br />Chicago is about a aspiring preformer (ROXIE-Zellwegger)living in chiCago in the 1920's. When she shoots someone she goes to jail where she meets some amazing people. Not only does she meet Mrs. Velma Kelly (Zeta-Jones)but meets Billie Flynn (Gere)the best murder case lawyer. When Roxie sits in jail she visions all these Razzle Dazzle musical numbers including ROXIE & WHEN YOUR GOOD TO MAMA. Will she be guilty or let off? Find out in chiCago and it will really Razzle Dazzle you.<br />All the actors are amazing and their singing skills are unbelievable who knew Rene Zellwegger or Richard Gere could belt out those tunes. I can't wait to see what the DVD offers (special features) and i bet you in the first week my DVD will be burned out and i'll have to buy a new one. LOL.
B000002LFU|5.0|Its' title is very contemporary for 'Green' came at a time when concerns about the environment were having mass impact. <br>In typical REM fashion, the colour of the sleeve is not green but orange. Song 7, of course, is Orange Crush which is about the serious concern of Vietnam. But this album, like most REM albums, is a curious mix- 'Orange Crush' could also refer to the unashamedly youthful, sweet, 'pop' sensibility of some of REM's inspirations- California, the 60s and its simple, direct political protest slogans: the dreamy 'Get Up' and the practical 'Stand'.  Sandwiched between these two is 'You are the everything', which oscillates between present concerns for the world and the sureness of the past with the riff of a mandolin.<br>      But any wrongly held suspicions that the casual listener might hold of nostalgic naivety on the part of REM is shot to nothing by 'World Leader Pretend', a song about one man's power and stupidity and its wider implications.<br>  Following this is the simply beautiful 'The Wrong Child' that seemlessly takes so many musical directions. Haunting piano melodies seep through Michael's lament about a boy who has 'never been' outside. Careful observers might draw comparisons with World Leader Pretend who doesn't seem to have spent much time out of his political office.<br>'Turn you inside out' could have been put on Monster without any incoherence but, again, it's about how much power a leader wields, whether he be a rock star or politician- Stipe continues :'I can swing my megaphone' on Hairshirt, which follows the delicate instrumentation of the earlier 'You are the everything'.  <br>      As for the other songs- Pop Song 89 is a bit clunky and not their best song ever but it works when placed next to Get Up. I Remember California reminds me of 'You' off Monster- it's dark and not the most comfortable song to listen to. That's probably why it's one of Michael Stipe's favourite songs on the album!<br>       To all the hardcore REM fans who think that this, their first Warner Bros. album, smacked of selling out I would just like to say that if REM are a sell out band then we need to redefine the word 'sell-out'  for all the true sell-outs who never had anything to sell. In a simple phrase, this album is full of pathos and political statement mixed with a bit of fun.  <br>As well as a full stop to the eighties and the beginning of REM on the Warner label, REM's subsequent albums would experiment even more radically within their own world. A wonderful album that marks a calm before the storm and the beginning of a new optimism.
B00004XOWM|4.0|Here's the break-down:<BR>1. Intro, nothing new.<BR>2. My goodness, great song but this song has more cuss words than any other song I've ever heard!!<BR>3. Awesome drums, awesome song and it's very, very heavy!!<BR>4. This song sounds like &quot;Stuck&quot; off the Three Dollar Bills Y'all album. It might be a remake!!<BR>5. Pretty good song, sounds different than the others!!<BR>6. Awesome song!! It kinda gets old after awhile, though.<BR>7. Awesome song!! Pretty neat lyrics, too!!<BR>8. Awesome intro, and the rest of the song is good, too!!<BR>9. It's a typical rap song, nothing special. It's pretty good.<BR>10. Mission Impossible 2 Theme Song!! Awesome, and it's very heavy!!<BR>11. Very depressing, but somehow uplifting. Awesome intro.<BR>12. Another depressing song. The lyrics sound like what happened to me before...<BR>13. Gosh, another depressing song!! It's not bad!!<BR>14. The rap version of song #6. Over 6 minutes of funky beats and alot of guest vocals!!<BR>15. Outro, nothing for me to say here.
B00008MNYS|2.0|Someone said Robbie Wiliams is a superstar like Madonna worldwide? ... well not quite. I don't think people think of RW as a legend or an icon, not even in the UK. RW tried the big band sound and failed. It was a pathetic record. While I like some songs from his earlier albums, with this one he seems to just go back to the old tried and true formula, i.e. the Guy Chambers sound (who actually made records before teaming up with RW). RW's lyrics are the same old egoistic trite stuff. He's not an \\"artist.\\" You can call him an entertainer but he will never be an artist. His music is not art. It's a commercial product and he's a good promoter. His humor is so tired. And I find his continuous effort to break into America really pathetic. An album is supposed to be coherent when you made it and most true artists would try to preserve their original. But his American releases are all modified to suit local tastes. This is commercial music. You may like it the first few times but his music gets very tired and irritating after 5 spins - this is what happens when there's no substance. Guy Chambers is an able musician and songwriter. Shame his talent is wasted on this talentless clown. If you want good British melodic rock music, try Mull Historical Society and Electric Soft Parade.
B00000JCB2|5.0|Here's the breakdown:<BR>1. Another Intro.<BR>2. Awesome intro, but I listen to this song just for the intro!!<BR>3. Awesome song, but it gets old after awhile. Funky beats galore!!<BR>4. Good heavy song!! One of my favorites!!<BR>5. OMG!! This has the coolest bass line I've ever heard!!<BR>6. A typical song, nothing special, I guess.<BR>7. MY FAVORITE SONG ON THIS ALBUM!! GREAT STUFF AND INSANE GUITAR AND BASS LINES AFTER THE SECOND CHORUS!! JONATHAN DAVIS FROM KORN LENDS HIS VOICE ON THIS SONG, TOO.<BR>8. It's alright. Nothing special here, though.<BR>9. It's okay until after the second chorus. Then it gets awesome!! <BR>10. OMG!! AWESOME RAP SONG!!<BR>11. Good heavy song, again!!<BR>12. Depressing, but also uplifting!! Awesome intro with the guitars!!<BR>13. This is a very good &quot;mosh&quot; song!!<BR>14. ??? I'm not sure what to say about this one. I usually skip this one.<BR>15. Outro. Nothing new or special.<BR>16. This is weird, I don't think it should even be here. It's only about 2 seconds of silence, then it ends!! Weird.
B000059ZT4|4.0|this is a great bob marley collection for everyone who loves reggae and bob marley.with never before heard versions of classic songs.And unreleased songs such as high tide low tide and all day all night.this is a great box set.
B00008J4P5|3.0|Hmmm, when I first heard Elephant, I loved it and wrote a review immediately.  I even gave it 5 stars.  Now, it's sitting in the sale bin at a used record shop.  The first few listens were thrilling, no doubt, but then the charm wore off.  I like that they're going for a more expansive sound, but in the process they seem to have lost the manic energy that drove their earlier albums.  I don't want a De Stijl: the Sequel or anything like that, all bands develop and change over time, but I think Elephant is just kind of boring after awhile.<br />I'm not saying they have completely lost it, there's some good stuff on here.  I think Meg White's drumming/time-keeping is perfect for their sound; they'd sound really silly if she did a lot of fills and syncopated rhythms.  Jack White is also a great vocalist and guitarist, and I'll probably get their next album.  But this one, hm, well, the media hype certainly charmed me.
B000002NJS|5.0|Ray of light is an emotional aquatic music album.When I hear the song Swim I feel like I 'm in the middle of the ocean. My favorite songs are Swim, Candy Perfume Girl, Sky Fits Heaven and ray of light. If you liked this album you'll probably like her new album &quot;Revenge&quot;. The song &quot;Revenge&quot; is the best of the album I also lkie &quot;Love Affair&quot; and &quot;CyberraGA&quot;
B00005ONMJ|5.0|I have gone back to this opera a third time. <br />Without any doubt, the jewel of the crown was Furtwangler albeit that Mozart was not exactly his favourite composer.  Vienna Philharmonic under the baton of Furtwanlger was so expressive and so full of drama, both by itself and when supporting the singers. And of course, the singers was a very strong team too, we have Siepi, Ernester, Grummer, Dermota, Casa, Edelmann, Berger and Berry... <br />Yes, in terms of psycho-analysis, we have a bit of Macbeth here instead of Midsummer Night's Dream in this opera. Mozart's   music was never meant to be singsongs as his soul always touches and concerns the breadth and depth of humanity. Was the Statute who put an end to the life of the rascal a symbol of his own father and Giovanni in a way Mozart himself subconsciously without himself knowing about it?<BR>    <BR>I watched this opera side by side with &quot;Dem Serail&quot;, another Mozart opera produced by DG. The orchestra was Bayeriscshen conducted by Karl Bohm, another favourite conductor of mine.   With Bohm, we have perhaps a little more lyricism but we don't have the sort of fullest possible support to the singers as we have from Furtwangler. Nor was there the drama. The orchestra was nearly as good as Vienna Philharmonic, but the singers are remarkably weaker, and one would suppose that got nothing to do with the language in which it was sung for it intended by Mozart to be sung in German. So, despite the recording was made some twenty years later, technology alone doesn't help much.<br />Even as far as visual and audio effects go, one would say Giovanni is better.  It was so natural and pleasing. The conductor's interpretation is so modern in every way, with all those extrordinary lines from all these superb singers, one would hardly notice that it was a 1954 performance at all. Instead, Dem Serail sounds a bit outdated now. <br />Definitely a treasure, Strongly recommended.
B000002NJS|5.0|I really loved this album, it's mix of eletronic and aquatic instruments. My favorite songs are: The Power Of Good Bye, To Have and Not to Hold, Ray of light and Swim.If you like this album you'll also like her 97'album call Revenge. Revenge is the best track of the album but Love affair is good too and Cyberraga
B00003CXTG|5.0|This is one of those movies that you can't forget.  The kind that when you think of it makes you catch your breath.  It gave me a greater awareness of what those in the military sacrifice to protect our country.
B000083E79|5.0|Just grand,--- uplifting and fun. Put this in on the way to work and you will have a smile when you get there!
B00005B36H|5.0|This is a great album because, firstly, I can fall asleep to it, and no other rock album that I own induces this kind of semi-consciousness, which is not to say that its boring; far from it.  It's pulsating drum and bass beats are both lulling and rousing, depending on your intent.  Lateralus covers the whole spectrum of rock, from pure metal onslaught to mellow percussion pieces like the trio of tracks 10/11/12.  The album comes off as being highly technical, but is at the same time undeniably organic.<br />Secondly, the 'mature' lyrics are exactly that; where else will you find such a probing commentary on the post-modern, post-structural social condition? (haha) Seriously, name me one album who's lyrics include the word 'juxtapose' (sure, its standard college-brat terminology, but its nice to know that Maynard's mind is in the right place; attempting to make the 'pieces fit', and not just damning it all to hell; an easy route that most other bands take.)<br />Lateralus will strike both your mind and body with its tunnelling  riffs and its thoughtful, seemingly cryptic verses. And nothing beats seeing Parabola performed live.
B00007BK2N|5.0|This movie made me homesick.  Alright, the review is supposed to be about the movie but if you want friggin film criticism, read Stephen Hunter in the Washington Post.  All I can say is that if you lived in Manchester in 1976, you will GET this film.  If not, you might understand it but you won't ever GET it.  If someone was to tell me that a fine, fine movie would be made about Madchester when I was 19 and living in Stockport, I would have chucked you out on your arse.  However, a fine, fine movie was made and it did put a lump in me throat.<BR>P.S.<BR>Pete Shelley:  I love ya, mate.
B00008H2LB|5.0|i have yet to hear an LP song that i don't like. ALL of their songs from the EP album, Hybrid Theory, and Reanimation rock! Meteora is no different! i do detect a different style with this album but i still like it! personally, i never buy CD's, (i download music instead) and for me to go out and buy one, it has to be good. LP's Meteora is that damn GOOD!
B000000JO3|3.0|This is a good record, but seems to be one of the most overrated records in the history of hardcore.  The recordings on this album are over-produced.  To hear the best of minor threat I would suggest trying to track down a copy of their demo which is pretty widely avaiable through tapetrading and has been bootlegged onto record a couple of times.
B000060P79|5.0|When I heard Simple plan's single 'I'd Do Anything' for the first time I was hooked. Their mix of punk-rock angst with dance-pop beats makes any other CD sound like a bunch of sappy love songs. I love the way that in their songs they could be singing about a broken heart or a ...girlfriend, yet still it makes you want to jump up and dance! Simple plan is wonderful, If you are into punk-pop like Good Charlot, All american rejects, Bowling for soup, or just about any other group like them you are sure to enjoy this CD. I hope my review helped you in the decision of buying this CD, and that you love it just as much as I do. (Tip: although all their songs are great, listen to the ones that aren't all the popular, you'll love them even more!)
0316666343|5.0|This became my favorite book when I read it.  It is very emotional, and it was very well written.  If you are looking for a book to read then this I would recommend...
B000001F26|5.0|This is a good place to sample Eric's solo career. It is also a good place to start if the Crossroads box set is too expensive for the casual fan. My advice is please also check out the Cream of Clapton too.
B00008H2LB|3.0|I liked both the Reanimation Album and the Hybrid Theory but the problem is that this album doesn't exactly meet the Hybrid Theory(I'm not counting Reanimation since it was a remix) in terms of standards.<br />Some of the tracks sound very similar to the tracks in their previous albums due to the format the songs are laid out in.<br />Very polished but I am fairly disappointed, given that they could have done a lot more with this album. Instead of just relying on a successful formula, they could have gone all out and done something different. They didn't. And therefore some of the tracks sound boring and fairly repetitve while some are more like mis-matched music with an attempt to make it all sound right. If they had really taken this long to make this album, I'd say it's quite an amount of effort gone to waste.<br />Sometimes, you need someone other than your friends or someone you know to get a true and honest critic of something that you made.<br /><br />To LP: There are like a thousand over instruments in the world and even if you don't use anything else from what you already have, you still have your imagination and sense of rhythm and other stuff that made the first album successful. So, I don't see what's so difficult in re-inventing yourselves. Too many bands have fallen prey to the fixed formula method simply 'cos they didn't venture outside their boundaries when doing vice versa could have put them onto the path of success.
B00005OAIE|5.0|My Wife liked the one song that play on the the air. So I got it for her. She likes it a lot. And I like it alot too. It has a very good sound to it. I think if you got it you would not be disappointed at all.
B000069CWE|5.0|when I picked up this album.<br />It was fantastic and many of the tracks were absolutely fun, fun, fun and awesome to listen to. Given how fantastic Hybrid Theory was, Reanimation only added onto the fun factor of the album!
B00004Z459|5.0|I like this one it is very good. it will go good with all of the other rock albom you might have. It has a good sound to it. It was a very good whan it first came out.
B000002UAO|5.0|With respects to Revolver, Sgt Pepper's and all the others, I firmly believe that Rubber Soul is my favorite album of all time.  Out of almost 1,000 CDs I own, Rubber Soul is tops!  It was released well before I born, but I find so much passion and inspiration in these songs.  As a songwriter, singer and guitarist, The Fab Four have provided me with many musical lessons.  The songs on this album are the beginning of the Beatles' experimental period.  You can hear Dylan's influence here.  I am glad that even though the Beatles broke up about 10 years before I was born, I can always go back to their great songs.  If pressed, &quot;In My Life&quot; is my favorite one here.  The Beatles were not only one of the first bands to write their own songs, but that also did not put filler songs on their albums.  Great to buy for a novice or a diehard like myself, Rubber Soul will bring you much enjoyment....guaranteed!
B00006RU5B|5.0|When I first got Audioslave I was taken a chance on it. I never heard of them befor. I think it is one of the best new rock bands out ther. I think if you have not got it yeat go get it now. You will not be disapointed at all. I love it.
0385503954|5.0|In all honesty, it took me a long time to progress beyond the first fifty pages of this novel. The more than three hundred that followed, however, I devoured in three days. As with an earlier book by McEwan, THE INNOCENT, pushing past the exposition requires great patience and discipline. Rich with the prose of THE LOVELY BONES, and ripe with the building excitement of CONQUEST OF PARADISE, ATONEMENT unfolds into a beautifully written novel.  The story develops at somewhat of a plod, though the richness of the author's prose vividly illustrates scenes in the 1930's with such detailed resonance that the reader is all the more emotionally involved when events take a turn for the worse.   From that point forward, the unfolding of this mature and insightful narrative is a privilege to read, and the reader (at least this one) emerges reluctantly from the final page with a desire to begin the book anew - with a better understanding of where the characters err.
B00007E8V4|5.0|This is a very good rock band. I like it a lot. It hard to say witch one of there album is the best. I like them all. This would fit right in to all of all your other rock album.
0316666343|5.0|I found this novel to be very comforting. The author leaves a warm and thoughtful idea that heaven is in the eye of the beholder. Alice Sebold captured my complete attention throughout her novel because the characters are so endearing and so thoughtfully written and the setting is so complete and imaginitive. Your heart can't help but feel the weight of loss on Susie's family. I enjoyed this book so much, that I would forget for a moment that I was reading a work of fiction.  The unique imagery reminded me of the SECRET LIFE OF BEES, while the suspense reminded me of CONQUEST OF PARADISE. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has lost a family member and wonders about the afterlife. Even though, the afterlife is a work of fiction, I found it a great comfort in hoping that my loved ones are really watching over me and family. I eagerly anticipate another masterpiece by Alice Sebold.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I got this 0ne whan it first came out and it is good or as good as there last album. It has a good rock sound to it. If you get you will not be disaponted at all.
0440224764|5.0|Though I have read 4 or 5 Grisham books since I read the Partner, I am convinced that it is Grisham's very best.  The premise of the book is a partner in a law firm that steals 90 million and runs away to Brazil (my home country).  The book starts by him being captured (so no secrets give away here) and evolves through a brilliant set of plot twists that lead up to a surprising and heartbreaking ending.<br />This is the type of book to pick up one day and finsih the next; make sure you have time to read it straight, because it will be hard to put it down once you start, and it will definitely leave an emptiness after you finish.  This is the best international theft thriller I have ever read.
B00006RU5B|5.0|When I first got Audioslave I was taken a chance on it. I never heard of them befor. I think it is one of the best new rock bands out ther. I think if you have not got it yeat go get it now. You will not be disapointed at all. I love it.
B000084T18|1.0|50 cent cant rap to save his life. He has no skills at all. he says he was shot 9 times, it must have been in the mouth. All his words are blurred mumbled. The one good thing about this album is dr.dre. He proves he is still the best producer in tha biz. The only people who will like this lp are teen bimbos who dont know anythin about real hiphop. Any true fan of hiphop should make it there goal in life to burn all 50 cent cds...
B00007E8V4|5.0|This is a very good rock band. I like it a lot. It hard to say witch one of there album is the best. I like them all. This would fit right in to all of all your other rock album.
B00000099Y|5.0|There's not much need in my opinion, for me to expound on an album with 712 reviews.  I only have an urge to tell those optimistic like I was when considering buying this album that it is awe-inspiring.  There's a lot I owe to Maynard Keenan in introducing me to Bill Hicks, who is now my favorite comedian of all time.  This is one of the best albums I've purchased, and there's much depth to it.  <br />Perhaps it's too pre-mature for me to give a review now...I've only owned this album for a month.  I love this band, and they deserve the praise they get in the way they've made me feel alone.  I could of summed it up with that.  My favorite song on here is the title track.  SUPERLATIVE.  Buy it--I don't think you'll regret it.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Love Jack's loving that he's a man. Rock and roll is best when it's about libido, as demonstrated by the superb \\"Ball and Biscuit,\\" a song that starts in the ears and comes out the fly of your ultra low-rise jeans.<br />There's been something wan and timid about rock since the eighties, most recently we've been handed stuff like Wilco, which comes off like the deep thoughts of a \\"gifted\\" eighth grade boy. Viva Jack, Meg, and the noisy, dirty factories of Detroit that spawned this noisy, dirty record.
B000084T18|3.0|50 cent is truly very overrated.I mean he is just another newcomer rapper like Fabolous who can't rap.But i admit that the production of the album good but 50 cent bring it all down with his lazy vocal.The stand out songs on this album are many men(wish death), in the club and 21 Questions.While the others are just sort of crap.overall, 50 cent is just another rapper who got lucky with the help of Dr. Dre and Eminem or he would still be another unknown chap.
B00008972S|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this! The most brilliant musical ever filmed!

B00000J7JO|5.0|Californication is brilliant, to say the least. The way I look at music is...You don't hear it, you taste it. Stuff like country and western to me tastes like...broccoli, or bad milk. Stuff like Godsmack, Korn....Tastes like...Bland. The Chili Peps' Californication tastes sweet and refreshing. Great effort, great songs, great bassline, great album.<br />Reprazent da west coast, RHCP.
B00003CY6M|4.0|When I rented this movie I wasn't sure what to think. Being a Classic film buff I can be rather critical. What drew me to it was John Cusack, Always a huge fan of his. After watching this I still am. Sure, you probably have seen it done before..Two people meet and feel that fate has something to do with it. In my opinion its the way the talent delivers themselves. Any Guy that watches this movie can almost feel they are John Cusack in the position he is in. Any girl can feel like Kate Beckinsale. You pull for them, You relate with them. Set in the beginning with a beutiful New York Christmas and great supporting cast of Molly Shannon and Eugene Levy. Its a solid movie that you can feel good watching over and over again.

0141301104|5.0|Witches, by Roald Dahl is one of my favorite books. I just finished it. I am Christain and my mom is picky of what I read. She saw Witches and almost took it away. It is hilarious!<br />The boy has no name, because he is telling the story. His parents die in a car wreck, and he is sent to live with his grandmamma in England. She teaches him about the witches and how to tell who is a witch and who is a woman.They are instructed to move back to America. Grandmamma gets sick from smoking cigars and can't take the boy to his dream place int he summer. The doctor instructs her to go to the ocean coast.<br />While there, they stay in a hotel where the grand high witch is holding a meeting. 90 witches are in the meeting room. How will the boy get out after stuck in the room? He is turned into a mouse. Read on to find out.
0385504209|3.0|Good story, except for the last 20% of the book.<br />At that point the author starts to have the characters to things they would not do except to mislead the reader.<br />In the book earlier part of the book the readers get the same information that the main characters do, however at this point in the book the author withholding information the characters do.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This album is an excellent example of how bands can grow, change, and experiment with sound.  It is impossible not to incorporate sounds from the past, and indeed, there is an undeniable influence from music of the past few years on this record.  But if you like the sounds of Hybrid Theory, you will like this album.  The fact that it might sound kind of 'pop' is irrelevant.  In my opinion, &quot;Easier to Run&quot; and &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; are great tracks that show that you don't need the crunching guitar of Korn or the insane beats of Slipknot to make a good song.  While I don't dismiss these other acts, Linkin Park has definitely carved its own niche in the modern world of rock, and this album definitely overcomes the challenge of &quot;sophomore&quot; albums........  But make your own choice.
B00004CWO8|1.0|I saw this video after hearing a lot about it from my friends.  I did not enjoy it at all.  Swan Lake is a classic that will always be in the hearts of true ballet lovers.  This version, which has been called the gay version of Swan Lake, with all male swans, and strong Oedipus complex overtones should not be allowed to use the name of the original, classic, and beautiful ballet.  I have no problem with the homosexual element to this production, but why not just create a whole new work, rather than radically change a classic? <BR>  As a ballet dancer myself,  I felt the choreography was very medicore, the music was altered in many places to become almost unrecognizable, in short, this production took away everything that I love about Swan Lake.<BR>  Don't waste your time or money on this one.  Stick to the original.
B00005NKW3|5.0|The film begins with the supervisor of the parade assigning people to their posts. Isn't it always difficult with people hired for a one-day job? Then we see her daughter, raised as a  sensible, rational little adult. As compensation for her failed marriage, or a symptom of the failure? Some say you should never lie to a child, like telling them about Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, or other legends. But doing so prepares them for life: they will be lied to by rulers, advertisers, employers, friends, and relatives. Get used to it, kid!<br />The story is that the real Kris Kringle shows up to play Santa Claus - which he does to perfection. He is \\"too good to be true\\". This film contrasts the legends to the realities of adult life. What would happen if everyone spoke the truth as they knew it? Is this film a warning against forcing children to grow up too soon?<br />Susan Walker tells Santa Claus what she really wants: a home with a backyard where she can play. Isn't that what every child should have? After happily married parents? One scene shows Mr. Macy shaking hands with Mr. Gimbel; is this a comment on world conflicts? Another scene discusses the \\"guilt complex\\" of giving<BR>away gifts. Does this explain the charities of Carnegie, Rockefeller, and the others?<br />The story continues with Kris Kringle brought into court for a sanity hearing. Anybody who doesn't believe in Santa Claus, or lawyers, should see this. Yes, the scenario is rigged, just like a lot of life. Or maybe some court cases? Does public opinion affect trials like in this film? Do political bosses advise<BR>judges in real life? How do you think judges get appointed? Kris Kringle's lawyer persists in his defense, even at the cost of his job. He will defend ordinary people against their oppressors. The political boss explains the economics of the Santa Claus legend, a fact that cannot be denied.<br />Since the Post Office has a ton of dead letters, they decide to send them to the courtroom. His identity is thus authenticated by the US Government! The ending is drawn out, but little Susan finally gets her Christmas present. \\"You have to have faith\\" says her mother. And another happy ending to a Hollywood movie.<br />The saddest fact is that Natalie Wood never lived long enough to play the mother in the remake. Real life doesn't always have a happy ending.
B000083E79|3.0|Good things about this album : new tracks from her last two albums, plus some duets from Sonny &amp; Cher period. Bad things about this album : She already has two other (if not more) greatest hits albums. Her 99' &quot;IF I Could Turn Back Time : Cher's Greatest Hits&quot; has everything that a Cher fan would need in their entire lifetimes. <br />Why buy this album? If you are a Cher fanatic, and must own any and every Cher album, or has not bought &quot;IF I Could Turn Back Time : Cher's Greatest Hits&quot;, then you should definitely buy this album. Otherwise, don't spend the money.
0140186409|5.0|Most people read this book for the first time in an english class. Thus they have to read it fast and they don't get as much out of it. I did not. I chose to read this book, partly because I had heard more good than bad about it, partly because though it was in the 50's, my dad took route 66 from Missouri to California, but the main reaso I read The Grapes of Wrath is because after I got out of High School I wanted to read Literature finally at my own pace, and mainly read the books I never did in school.<br />I dont think I would have liked this book had I had to read it in school because it is 600+ pages but I tell you this. The Grapes of Wrath is the best book I've ever read, and Steinbeck is far up if not the best American author of all time. This book can be compared to Huck Finn. Poor folk, some in trouble with the law make an odessy to a new place, far away. The thing that separates the Steinbeck from Twain is that in this book there were chapters, almost every other one, that didn't pertain to the Joads. They were more an generalized vignette of expiriences that happened to many families who made this journey. May it be lack of food and water on the road or the dustbowl storms destroying a corn crop.<br />Steinbeck weaves characters like a master and Tom Joad's final speech will live on in my mind forever: &quot;Wherever they's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever they's a cop beatin' up some guy, I'll be there.... An when our folks eat the stuff they raise an' live in the houses they build-why, I'll be there.&quot;<br />In short, this book is fantastic, one of the best and a must read for anyone. It is a great story of a family's strife against the elments, struggle for enough money to live, and their belief in the good things getting them by.
B000065U1N|5.0|This Movie is one of the best war movies that I've seen. What's so captivating about this movie is the fact that it's non-stop action, and good action. Very realistic and very well done. Presto, Hats off.
0316666343|4.0|I read this book because my English teacher recommended it and I was not disappointed at all.  Mostly, all the points in the story are clear, and its OBVIOUS what decade the story takes place in.  It said more than once when Susie died, so using common sense you could assume the story takes place around the same time period.  There are times when the actions in the book are hazing, but the book it worthwhile and not a waste of time by any means.  And I know books that have been a waste of time.
B00008H2LE|5.0|I have been a fan of Linkin Park for like ever. Hybrid Theory was awesome, but this cd is soooo much better. I was slightly disappointed with Reanimation. Everyone should absolutely go out and buy this cd. Even if you're not sure if you'll like it or not, buy it anyway! It's worth it!
B00008H2LB|5.0|It sounds similar to the other LP CD's, but it definitely has a new original sound.  It is a quality CD despite what others may say.  They still scream (haven't gone soft like other bands), have badass guitar rhythm, rapping, and singing.  I gave it to my girlfriend and she left it in the car CD player yesterday.  I've heard it straight through a couple times now.  Have to get myself a copy. great stuff, get it, or miss out.
068484267X|5.0|After I read the book, Angela's Ashes, I felt as though I had lived and experienced a whole different life. This new life, was in Ireland, and I faced the same harships as the protagonist, Frank McCourt, went through.  This book made me realize that you should be happy with the little things in life that you take for granted, because some people might not even have those items.  I can't even express in words, what kind of impression this book made on me.  I think that this has to be in the top 3 of my favorite books.  I learned a lot about the culture and values of this family, which makes it a book worth reading.
0375414053|1.0|I found this woman absolutely despicable.  Poor jack-of-all-trades, master of none. She wants to have it all and in the process mutilates the lives of everyone around her.  I didn't laugh once.  I didn't cry. I did feel incredible shame that our global society has so many woman like this one - woman who not only leave their families, husbands and friends in their flustered wake as they kid themselves into believing what important people they are in the business world - but also who  look down their noses in disdain at the women who feel their place is with their families.  I feel sympathy for the poor sheep who read books like this and feel that something must be wrong with them for getting sleep and spending time with their kids and doing things that make their families see how important they are to her.<br />What was the purpose of this book?  Are we supposed to feel sorry for her?  No, we are supposed to be in envious awe of her as the superwoman who sacrifices so much for - for what?  I never did figure that out.  Maybe we wouldn't have a 60% divorce rate and such a high kids-on-drug rate if woman like this didn't tout their lives in poorly written books before they stopped and meditated on why they had to live this *fulfilling* life style. <br />Logistically, it was hard to follow with all the British references - some that could not even be infered by context. I had no problem with Bridget Jone's Diary (a much better book depicting a life that could be related to). Of course, gratuitous use of the 'f' word everywhere - can't have a best seller without it. Every cliche, every predictable predicament -every yawnnnnnn sex reference, yeah, she has it all.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Fantasy?...Of course, but what a fun fantasy, action packed fantasy.  Tobey Maguire brings the Spider Man character to life, he makes the character seem so real, and those Spider Man moves are so slick.  He's having fun and you're having fun watching this.  Even his nemesis, the Green Goblin has some incredible scenes (and cool dialogue).  Make this one a must have for your  collection.
0385504209|5.0|This is a fun, entertaining book. Take it to the beach and start turning the pages! You can almost see the movie as you read this thriller.<br />Dan Brown has successfully arbitraged a lot of research about the Holy Grail and Mary Magdelene and the Knights Templar with the general public's lack of awareness of all that research into a cosmic whodunit.Along the way, you learn about Fibonacci Numbers, The Codex Leiscester, church and art history and mythology.<br />If you want to know more about all the issues the plot deals with, buy &quot;The Templar Revelation&quot;, by Picknett and Prince, at the same time(published in 1998, the first chapter is entitled &quot;The Secret Code of Leaonardo DaVinci&quot;!). Their non-fiction book describes in depth practically everything The DaVinci Code treats in this fictional representation.
B00003CXXM|5.0|I had no desire to see this when it played at the theatre, even though reviews had been impressive.  Rented it and realized this is great.  Lots of energy, some incredible scenes, definitely a DVD to add to your library.  One minor item...Damon's character is not clearly defined in terms of his capabilities and physical development/makeup.  He does AMAZING things.
1565847873|3.0|This time inspector Kurt Wallander has to solve the murder on two very well-dressed men, who float ashore the Swedish coast on a raft. The trail leads to Latvia. After his Latvian colleague is also murdered, Wallander ends up in a web of intrigues in an unstable country that is unknown to him and where he does not speak the language. Soon he finds out that one of his two nearest Latvian colleagues is the villain, but which one of the two?<br />In contrast to Faceless killers by the same author, this book contains much more action, but after a while I became quite dizzy with all the twist and turns that the story took. It is an entertaining story, but Wallander appeared less real to me than in the previous book.
B000089RVX|5.0|i never heard of this band until very recently. It was playing on the radio and when the song came on i called the radio station, and they gave me the cd. i think it is an awsome new sound of music. its a good break from the happy go lucky music like smashmouth and sum 41. its more like a mixture of POD and<BR>kitty.
0618001905|4.0|How did nearly ten million deaths in one African colony escape the ears of history? In King Leopold's Ghost, Adam Hochschild opens our eyes to what really went on during the late 1800's and the early 1900's in the Congo. In this gruesome tale of greed, terror, and death, Hochschild shows us the lines from which the Congo was derived and means by which it was raped of it's rich history and natural resources. Very well written and easy to understand King Leopold's Ghost exposes the near extinction of a race of people by a tyrant who never once set foot in the land of his plunders. An excellent read in every way.
0140177396|5.0|John Steinbeck truly outdone himself this time by writing one of best pieces of literature ever recorded by the English tradition. This is a story about two guys named Lenny and George who live in the 18th century and just try to make enough money to survive.  They encounter many problems but they also make friends along their journey.  George has a problem dealing with Lenny because of Lenny's mental illness and because he gets George in trouble too much.  Steinbeck really makes you feel like you're in the book with the characters and adds a sense of setting that we can all picture in our minds.  <BR>        I was never able to put down this book because I always wanted to know what would happen next.  The suspense is unimaginable and the story seems so real that it's almost like Steinbeck was actually there following George and Lennie around.  Read this book and you will discover the hardship of life in the 18th century for Lower Class men with no families, no home, and no long term job.  They have to move on to job to job and get paid about 15 cents a day.  They also encounter a lot of danger throughout the story and makes the reader wonder what will happen next.  Everybody should read this book because the conclusion is guranteed to suprise you.
6303168507|5.0|Nearly a decade ago, I sat in a darkened theatre in Kansas City, attempting to view Steven Spielberg's brilliant \\"Schindler's List\\" for the first time. Highly respectful of the director's factual (and unflinching) presentation of a world plunged into madness, I nevertheless fled the auditorium little more than halfway before the film's conclusion. A scene involving a cherubic Jewish child - and the lengths to which the frightened boy took to escape certain death at the hands of Nazi barbarity - so overwhelmed me that I could remain in my seat no longer. Weeping and shaking with revulsion and sorrow, I eventually regained my composure with great travail and returned home - and resumed my place amidst a generation that had never directly known war. <br />I recently purchased the VHS version of \\"Schindler's List\\" - and was at last able to view the film in its entirety. Spielberg's masterwork boasts two bravura performances: Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler and Ralph Fiennes as Nazi kingpin Amon Goeth. In Neeson's capable hands, Schindler emerges as a man of deeply rooted flaws - and an ultimate redemption of staggering resonance. The paradoxes are abundant: Schindler is a member of the Nazi party - yet he saved many Jews from certain death in the gas chambers. A practicing Catholic (a religion which purports to champion the sanctity of all human life), his initial fealty to a genocidal racist (Hitler) is somehow swept under the vestments. A keenly savvy businessman, he was also a profiteer of slave labor. Possessed of sexual magnetism and evident charisma, he nevertheless conducts his casual assignations with thinly veiled arrogance. (Early in the film, Schindler is seen complaining about the need to replace his workers when one of them is shot or deported. He is not so much sorrowful as he is petulant. In another scene, Schindler's wife literally walks in on one of his plethoric affairs. He is not so much regretful as he is annoyed at being caught, somewhat akin to an adolescent when his lollipop and/or outer infant is removed and he has to look for yet another opiate.) Like many of his fellow Nazis, Schindler is a man of extravagant appetites - whoring, drinking and eating with a great deal of noise - and little subtlety. (Spielberg deftly juxtaposes these scenes against portrayals of the deprivation and suffering inflicted upon the Jews.) Schindler's dichotomy is so pervasive that, even when he attempts to be compassionate (such as his obvious concern for Goeth's long-suffering female servant) - the audience (not to mention the servant herself) is initially on edge - half expecting him to molest her - and the other half breathing a sigh of relief at his sympathy. <br />Fiennes is simply astonishing in his portrayal of the murderous Goeth. In a Nazi party boasting a surfeit of bestiality, Goeth was particularly snake-like. In an early scene, the sadistic assassin stands idly on the balcony of his sumptuous villa, coldly perusing the mournful parade of half-starved Jewish laborers. Soon, pre-alcoholic senility and post-coital torpor surrender to action:  Amon has an itch.  His copious gut jiggling southward like an epileptic jello-mold, the porcine pasha reaches for his rifle. Goeth then randomly shoots two Jews before slithering into his bathroom to ciphon the python. In another seminal scene, Fiennes brilliantly portrays the conflicted desire Goeth harbored for his Jewish housekeeper and cook. \\"Is this the face of a rat?\\" the tortured Goeth asks himself while contemplating animal coupling. (Mercifully, the helpless servant wasn't forced to engage in this act of obscenity, but was nonetheless beaten by the beast.) As anyone who has observed Fiennes in interview montages is acutely aware, the talented actor is a genteel, sensitive artist, with eyes and expression of manifest sensitivity and intelligence.  That Fiennes was able to transform himself into a murderer of such unspeakable evil is a truly stunning feat; his performance is astounding.  With all due respect to Tommy Lee Jones - Fiennes should have won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1994. (As a testament to his acting chops, five years later the versatile actor would portray a Nazi victim in \\"Sunshine\\" - with equally disarming skill.) <br />\\"Schindler's List\\" also gives the lie to a pervading myth surrounding Hitler and his henchmen:  The familiar theme of regarding the Jews as somehow \\"subhuman\\" or \\"nothing creatures\\" who could (and should) be exterminated at will.  Was Hitler ever able to explain how a non-entity could work at a factory for little or no wages - often during ungodly long hours and under deplorable conditions?  How can one exploit a \\"nothing\\" for one's own personal gain, as so many Nazis did with manipulation and cunning?  The answer, of course, is that they couldn't have.  Cruelty, man's inhumanity to man, and the primacy of personal choice and conscience (or lack thereof) were at the fore here.  Hitler was, in essence, a liar.  Tragically, he was a  particularly convincing one for far too many.<br />Thankfully, the conclusion of \\"Schindler's List\\" reverberates with poignancy and reverence. The accomplishment of the perplexing Schindler cannot (and should not) be downplayed: He saved countless lives, and for that he deserves profound respect. However, this film is, chiefly, a triumph for humanity and a great, great accomplishment for Steven Spielberg. For this viewer, Schindler's victory is somewhat ambiguous - and his dichotomy too troubling - to rescue him completely from the shadows.
B000002H2Z|5.0|This is an excellent album so I was going to replace it with the CD but it appears to be incomplete.

0345457684|5.0|Richard Morgan got a hit on his hands with this stunning sf noir thriller set in the 25th century where real death is only a memory to a select few!Technology exists in this future society where a person's consciouness can be stored in a cortical stack and download into another body(sleeve). Ex Un envoy Takeshi Kovacs is killed in a firefight with the authorities and he finds himself in another body on Earth in Bay City which use to be San Francisco. He is hired or threatened by the rich Laurens Bancroft to find out who had him to kill himself! Morgan's sf thriller has it all: scenes of brutal violence as Kovacs uncovers a rather sinister conspiracy that will rock this future society to it's core. Morgan's vision of the future where human life is bought and sold and where death loses it's sting to select few who can afford it.Another thing I love about this novel is wonderful characters both good and evil who inhabit this world: Takeshi Kovacs-a man who finds his conscience as he battles his corrupt enemies. Kristin Ortega-the cop who has ties to Kovacs that makes her distrust him at first. Laurens Bancroft-<BR>centuries year old man who's hires Kovacs to find out who tried to kill him. Miriam Bancroft-Laurens wife who has some dark secrets of her own as she tries to seduce and stop Kovacs.I love the gritty feel of this book with it's scenes of future eroticism<BR>and gory violence and it's theme of in the future technology changes but human nature doesn't!Greed and betrayal figure in this advance world. I can't wait to read the next Kovacs novel!
B00008J4P5|5.0|I really wish I could be more lucid about The White Stripes latest album 'Elephant', but frankly, all that needs to be said is that it is as good as anything they've done previously. In fact it mixes up the styles from previous releases pretty well, Meg gets to sing, and it has a little bit of a darker edge that makes it all the more listenable and yet another great album from a band that keeps getting better.
B000002572|5.0|Ask any true professional or semi-pro guitar player who understands the roots and history of rock music to name his top five guitar albums and Boston's first album will be on that list!  The reason is TONE!  Boston was one of the only rock bands ever to employ three (3) guitar players (Tom Sholz, Barry Goudreau, and Brad Delp) who knew how to achieve the guitar TONE that all aspiring guitar players strive to achieve in their careers - the tone of the gods. <br /> Their expert use of harmonics, synthesis, and technology was also apparent in this album. It's a classic showcase of &quot;this is how it's done.&quot; Of course it certainly helped that Tom Sholz, the lead guitar player and musical brains behind the band, had already achieved a master's degree in Engineering from MIT!  Sholz not only mastered all the guitar synthesis technology available at that time, but his engineering knowledge helped him to make contributions of his own to the state of the technology art. <br />This album is a pure rock music masterpiece and is a must CD for anyone who enjoys rock music.  It's not only a landmark in rock history, it's a monument to the artists who significantly contributed to the state of the musical art and a standard for ALL guitar players to aspire to!
B000002V07|5.0|i've heard so much about this particular mazzy album that i decided to give it a try. saying that it was unbelieavably<br />worth it remains an understatement. i keep listening to&quot;fade into you&quot; , &quot;blue light&quot; and &quot;5 strings serenade&quot; and i never get enough of  these exquisitly haunting songs. not that the rest of the album is bad, on the opposite! it all flows in smoothly and all the songs are wonderful, sad, and... i dont know just give them a listen and you'll 'see' for yourself, but still the three songs mentioned above, stand from the rest and are among my timeless favorites.
B00005T30L|5.0|I read all the five star reviews that have been posted; we should all start a club! I'm 34 and I was completely and unexpectedly devastated by this film, perhaps my favorite coming of age picture since The Graduate. I was floored, watched it twice; i didn't laugh much, although it is certainly a very funny movie in spots. Despite a slightly heightened reality, the tone is just so honest and it's full of touching moments throughout and i had to fight back tears in the last half hour. So rich and right. So many themes about friendships and where society is going and fitting in, loss and trying to be yourself. It's like those rare moments when reading a short story or novel and feeling so at home with the setting and characters, even if it's unpleasant at times. I found the ending very sad and perfect. It is ambiguous, but if you've been paying attention to this movie and relate to what's taking place with the characters and the world around them, you should be shaken and inspired by it. There's nowhere to really go, no place to really escape to unfortunately, if you're a sensitive or &quot;out of step&quot; person in this world; But it's sometimes important that you go out and take a risk, try to find someone who understands. Ultimately all we have is ourselves though and that can be a crushing realization. Seeing this movie twice in twenty-four hours (and I may not ever watch it again) did not make me want to escape the world I inhabit, but to navigate it with some kind of grace and sense of humor. I don't know where to start except with what's in front of me.
6305897786|5.0|This movie is awesome!  Very well made horror/mystery flick.  Keeps you wondering up until the end.  Welcome back, Johnny Depp.
B00003CX5P|5.0|The first in the three part prequel trilogy in the incredible and groundbreaking Star Wars is a starting point of where all of the events of the entire Star Wars began.<br />The story begins in the Galactic republic headed by a mysterious named Queen Padme Amidala. The start of the rebel forces start to take shape in this Chapter in the Star Wars prequel with Padme's position of senator being jeopardized by the increasing rebel activity and the threat of galaxies breaking away from Amidala's republic. Also an Evil Trade Federation is also planning to take over her home planet Naboo. An organization called the Jedi Knights sends in a young Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn on a diplomatic but they don't realize that they are heading into a trap set up by Darth Sidious who's plotting to take over the republic and now a battle is about to begin as they now wage a diplomatic and military war against Sidious to stop his malicious plans and repel his droid warrior forces. During the course as we all know, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon meet a young boy named Anakin Skywalker, and they want him to train him to become a Jedi Knight but Yoda objects believing that Anakin is a serious danger to the Jedi and the galactic republic.<br />They also meet a mind numbingly loquacious amphibian being named Jar Jar Binks. While I don't necessarily dislike Binks nearly as much as most others, I thought that he was incredibly annoying on some occasions and almost felt like an extra character from a rejected kids cartoon show put onto Star Wars compared to the rest of the characters. On the other hand though, Jar Jar makes up for it though with some funny moments on an otherwise dark movie and is almost like the extreme opposite to the two main villains Darth Sidious and Darth Maul. The latter was a bit disappointing to me. It's not that Maul was one dimensional or showing little or no malice, quite the contrary, it's disappointing that THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH OF DARTH MAUL!!! I expected more of a role from him than what I expected. For that reason, I can't help but say that that was the main disappointment that I had with this movie thus taking a star off the ratings. Darth Maul though during the moments the spotlight focused on him, was awesome and the face definitely shows the extreme malice that he had in him. I even remember being Darth Maul for Halloween a few years ago but let's not change the subject of the review. Darth Maul though was one of the best characters on the movie and came off intelligent and evil and not just a background character. If \\"Phantom Menace\\" becomes forgotten in the distant future, Darth Maul though will be remembered. Padme Amidala, the one with the fancy Asian-style make-up, actually is a special decoy used by the real one who is played by Natalie Portman. I actually liked the fancy decoy version better as she looked more like a leader but the real one isn't bad either. Young Anakin Skywalker though was one of the best kid characters on a movie that I've seen in a long time, showing lots of bravery for someone so young. It's kind of odd how a 9 year old Anakin could actually build a racing pod vehicle! I thought that Jack Lloyd did a great job playing the young Anakin Skywalker. All of the surviving characters would improve on \\"Attack Of The Clones\\".<br />R2-D2 and C-3PO also meet and began their long friendship. This might sound odd but R2-D2 and 3PO, I've always liked more than most of the human characters in \\"Phantom Menace\\". To tell you the truth, I even like Jar Jar Binks too at times despite his sometimes highly bumbling character performances.<br />There is quite a bit of mumbo jumbo in the movie and it tends to sink the movie down a bit but the special effects though are absolutely stunning and stupendous, thus making up for the unnecessary mumbo jumbo. The battle scenes I thought were awesome to watch and lifted this movie off the ground of mediocrity. The sceneries and numerous landscapes though are visually stunning andthe Senate Room was a visual feast. The Pod Race was probably one of the best sci-fi action movie scenes that I've seen in many years at the time of this movie's release. Even so though, \\"Phantom Menace\\" suffers from poor plot development in some occasions and even some downright bumbling moments and these render it more for the Die-Hard Star Wars fans. I had relatively low expectation of this movie but despite being quite flawed and occasionally silly, it turned out to be a great movie and the opening chapter of Anakin's descent into the dark side. Still though, even I cannot deny that this was slightly disappointing in some areas. It's nowhere near the heights of the Episodes IV, V, & VI and even \\"Attack Of The Clones\\" was better but this movie could've been much, MUCH worse but overall, despite the major flaws to it, this is not a bad Star Wars movie. I think of it as more of a large bag of potato chips or popcorn and a can of soda as opposed to a mind-blowing epic masterpiece like the original three. \\"Phantom Menace\\" could've used better plot development and greater roles from Darth Maul but for the first chapter though, it's more like lying down of the foundation of the next five episodes. This movie only scratches the surface of what was to come on the Episode II and the cataclysmic events that'll become the backbone of Episode III! Overall though, \\"Phantom Menace\\" once it's finished will leave you hungry for more. Not a bad job from Mr. Lucas.

0385486804|5.0|This is a wonderful book that explores the human desire to explore and the hard cold truth of nature. Through most of this book I found myself identifying with Chris McCandless, admiring how he found no pleasure in the wealth his family offered, but instead found joy in the friendship and view of nature he found on the road. Yet in the end I was sad to see his dream of living of the land crushed by the hard reality nature offers. This is young man and a story I will never forget.
0385504209|4.0|As someone who has studied and been fascinated by the same subjects as are the characters in this book, I was captivated by the clever plot, but sorely disappointed in the ending of &quot;The Da Vinci Code.&quot;  This is due to the fact that the object of the protagonists' search is in the final analysis, not a physical object; and, as the author directs us, is not the point.  For anyone who has seen any classic Hitchcock film, you know that this kind of device is known as a McGuffin, the plot that motivates characters being more important than the actual thing being searched for.<br />The story is compelling and a bona-fide page turner for a good 7/8 of the book. While elements are implausible, they are of the sort that one discounts to keep moving. As a tour de force, that  7/8 of the story, a good 350 pages, takes place all in one evening.  But once dawn breaks, the reader is betrayed by the author, and the plot unravels into such implausability that it seems unfinished.<br />We are led to believe that the global secret being slowly revealed to the reader is of enormous importance, and at least eight people are killed to keep this secret from getting out.  Somehow I was not prepared to have this secret turn into a McGuffin of the most cosmic order.<br />A typical, maddening red herring Mr. Brown engages in, is to name the victim on page one Jacques Sauni&egrave;re. (Our protagonist, his granddaughter, we assume comes from the line of Sauni&egrave;res.) Anyone who has studied the mysteries of the Templars and the Grail--the premise of the McGuffin in this book--cannot help but know that Sauni&egrave;re is the name of the priest who, it is claimed, found a part of the Templar secret at Rennes-le-Chateau between 1890-1908.  While we are waiting to see what the connection is between Jacques Sauni&egrave;re and the priest Berenger Sauni&egrave;re, the final disppointment in the book is that there is no connection at all! Like the plot, it simply is gone in a puff of authorial smoke.<br />Some of the puzzles and codes solved by the protagonists are very clever; some are so obvious it is embarrasing that they can't find the answer for pages, when the reader can.<br />I don't mind that the search is for a McGuffin: but if that is the case, the characters might better be interested in each other as passionate love interest. Our male and female characters at the end, barely seem to acknowledge one another, making it a fascinating beginning, and rather a flaccid end.f the puzzles and codes solved by the protagonists are very clever; some are so obvious it is embarrasing that they can't find the answer for pages, when the reader can. <br />I don't mind that the search is for a McGuffin: but if that is the case, the characters might better be interested in each other as passionate love interest.

B00005J6T0|5.0|With five major international hits - True blue, La Isla Bonita, Open your heart, Papa don't preach and Live to tell - this is yet another brilliant album from Madonna, who set the standards for others to follow in the eighties.<br />Papa don't preach is about a teenager with an unintended pregnancy who decides to keep her baby. Live to tell is about an older and wiser woman who has learned not to believe men. True blue is, by contrast, a song about a woman who is happy with her man. La Isla Bonita is about memories of a holiday romance. Open your heart is about a woman who shows interest in a man but he does not reciprocate.<br />On this album, the five hits are unquestionably the best tracks, but the other four, all catchy, upbeat songs, are also worth hearing. This is an excellent album that includes some of my favorite Madonna hits.

0767819594|5.0|What a fantastic film! As dark as it may be, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Reese Witherspoon, Ryan Phillipe (hottie!), and Selma Blair are phenomenal in this twisted...well, I'm not sure what you'd call it. It's pretty funny in the beginning, but gets thrilling in the end.<br />The only bad thing about this movie would have to be it's ending. First a crucial character is...erm...well something bad happens to them, and then Sebastian gets revenge on Catherine. Then it just ends. I mean, you never see what happened to Catherine or Annette! You find out what happens to Sebastian, but not to the two (or three, if you include Ceccile (Selma Blair) female characters.<br />Just don't let young children see this movie, because I think that it gives a message saying \\"Doing it is okay, it's all fun and games.\\" Although the two evil characters do get revenge in the end.<br />An added bonus of this movie would be a scene in which you see Ryan Phillipe's butt.<br />Phillipe and Witherspoon have fantastic chemistry together, which would make sense seeing as they are now married and are expecting their second child. But everyone plays their characters well. Catherine is pure evil, Sebastian is also evil at first but softens, Annette is good-girl, and Ceccile is seriously naive and innocent.<br />A great buy - purchase this movie!
B00006JJ1O|4.0|This recording is very unique.  I had to listen to it twice to fully understand all of the influences.  This may sound a bit odd, but I hear part Teletubbie vocals, Cirque du Soleil melodies and vocals, Soho guitar rifts and edgy rock vocals.  This album crosses all the genres and is yet consistent.<br />I wasn't sure I was glad I bought the album after the first spin, but I was surely glad after the second spin.
B00005YTFG|5.0|This movie grabs you and doesn't want to let go. It is my all time fave. I know all the songs, can pretty much recite it, and have seen it about 100 times! You can read the plot above *points up* but Baz Luhrman does a fantastic job on this film. The vocals are amazing and you never get tired of this movie - hence my seeing it about 100 times! If you're in a romantic mood or a musical mood, turn to this movie. It's actually great for any mood. I watch it when I'm happy, sad, bored, nervous, etc. The extras at the end are pretty cool beans, too.
B000089A07|2.0|I'm pleased to see that other reviewers have had the same impression I had.  Red Dragon is just a remake of Manhunter, and not nearly as good.  All the performances in Manhunter are much more intense and edgy.  CSI's William Peterson is a better Graham, Tom Noonan a MUCH better Dolarhyde, and Brian Cox will always be THE Hannibal for me.  My two stars are for Harvey Keitel, always an interesting actor, even if his character wasn't.
B00008H2LE|2.0|There isnt a whole lot a guy can say about this album, besides how much of a dissapointment it is.  Almost every song on the album sounds like &quot;In the End&quot; and &quot;My December&quot;, the 2 songs that i dont like on Hybrid Theory.  It is too &quot;poppy&quot; and doesnt bring the same awesome riffs that hybrid did.  Calling all TRUE L.P. fans...we need to voice out soon or a potentially great band will be lost.  over and out.
B00005JLKN|4.0|This is a very worthy prequel to Silence of the Lambs, and is well worth seeing.  However, the DVD features are lackluster to say the least.  The interface is beautiful, but the features are no more than a few minutes apiece.  Considering how much they are hyped in the commercials, you don't get much for your money.  If you liked Silence, you'll like this.
B00008DDSC|5.0|This is so much better than I thought it would be, the characters are a little unusual, but they tie the plot together so well, it is well written, well acted, and on my personal &quot;must have&quot; list!
B000002J0B|5.0|Without going into any great depth reviewing each song individually as others have done, this album is a Ten, a 5 of 5, or however you want to say it. In my mind, it is not only Zep's best, but my favorite album by anyone, period. It has the variety of musical styles and moods that I never get tired of listening to.
B00005JLEU|5.0|....P>Spirited Away is amazing, and the animation breath-taking. Personally, this is a bold move for ....Disney. Disney acquired Miyazaki as a territorial move, not as a equal admirer. However, Disney does present its customer base with animation that is risky and features all life's shades, something that is integral to the growth of a human being.
0066214122|5.0|This has to be one of Crichton's best. You can tell he really reasearched for this book. The scientific infomation is clear, understandable, and up to date. The action is intense.  The science is facinating. The storyline is grand. If you love to read Crichton's novels than this would be a very good book to read and become an instant favorite. If you have not read any of Crichton's novels than this would be a good book to start off with. Wonderful, amazing, facinating, intense, grand, there are few words that can truly describe how great this novel is.
B00005AQE8|4.0|This is one of 2pac's better albums. The only thing wrong with it I can think of would be the excessive poppiness of it, especially on singles like 'California Love'. I could do without the 'shake, shake, shake'...makes me wince every time I hear it. Otherwise, it's chock full of interesting lyrics that cover just about any topic. The music is what you'd expect from well produced, mid-90s g-funk, and I like that...especially on the track with E-40 on it.
B000002UB6|5.0|As sloppy and underproduced as Let It Be is, those things are what give it its simple charm. In fact, as silly as it sounds, the album sometimes feels more spontaneous and fun than any other Beatles recording. Even the silly songs on Abbey Road were well polished and sequenced to perfection. Let it Be sounds more like John, Paul, George, and Ringo hanging out in your living room trying out new songs. <br />And thinking of it in those terms, there are some really great songs here. \\"Let It Be\\" and \\"Long and Winding Road\\" are well known hits. Then you have the intimate \\"Two of Us\\" which after listening to it, you can't believe that John and Paul would have been anything but best friends. \\"I Me Mine\\" is a great song from Harrison with a strong message. \\"I've Got a Feeling\\" and \\"Dig a Pony\\" are Lennon and McCartney at their best. And one of my personal favorite songs ever recorded \\"Across the Universe\\"... absolutely beautiful.<br />Some other advantages of Let It Be include the fun filler tracks like \\"Maggie Mae\\" and \\"Dig It\\" which are simply the band screwing around. Plus, there are no Ringo songs which is always a plus in my book. <br />For a beginner to the Beatles, this would be one to wait on. But for a serious fan, this is a must have. Let It Be is a loose, fun, and sometimes brilliant album from the best band ever.<br />It is hard to believe that they hated eachother so much while this was recorded.
B000002H97|4.0|This album represents Metallica's commercial peak, but can it live up to their classic 80's albums? A reasonably close comparison proves, sadly, no. While working on excellent radio songs such as &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; and &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;, the Sandmen have an unforgiven amount of songs that are half-baked in structure, and lyrically. &quot;The Struggle Within&quot; suffers from unbalanced, rushed choruses that are fugly to listen to, and some songs such as &quot;through the never&quot; &quot;of wolf and man&quot; are so pretentious, they will have diehards howling louder than the shape-shifting wolf. <BR>And then some of the songs are only as good as their (then) new approach will allow. What I mean is that this album is less electrifying than such Sandmen classics as Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets. I'll admit that it's mostly extremely well done, but the spark is missing....
B00008MNYS|4.0|Robbie Williams is full of himself. You know it. I know it. And obviously, Williams knows it, too. After all, this is a guy who blurts out in \\"Handsome Man,\\" \\"It's not very complicated/I'm just young and overrated.\\" But whatever your take on Robbie is, there's no denying his animated personality. His breezy new album, \\"Escapology,\\" is a huge improvement over his last studio disc of original songs, 2000's \\"Sing When You're Winning.\\" Reuniting with (and then firing) his longtime songwriting buddy Guy Chambers, Robbie's new album has the songwriting craft of Elton John and the Beatles, coupled with the stage presence of a twentysomething Freddie Mercury. The American version has a different tracklisting than the UK version (for one, there's no \\"Cursed,\\" a bitter kiss off to alleged paramour Geri Halliwell), but it works just as well. \\"Feel\\" is worthy of the US Top Ten status it achieved across the Atlantic, while \\"Me and My Monkey,\\" a seven minute track replete with Spanish horns, stands out pretty well. And, there's the tribute to his grandmother, titled \\"Nan's Song.\\" This is a disc of fine pop you can listen to without ever hitting the \\"skip\\" button. But will \\"Escapology\\" make him a star in a country already in love with the Justin Timberlakes, 50 Cents, and Avril Lavignes dominating our airwaves? It's tough to say. America is no easy market to penetrate, but if we sleep on a disc as fine as this, the loss will certainly be ours.
B00007G207|1.0|What would possess a director to take his award winning film and add 51 meandering minutes to it? Ego?  Greed? I bought this edition because I thought it included both the old and new versions (the jacket is a bit misleading...), I was sadly mistaken. By the end of this film I knew more about these people than my own family and I felt as if I'd been watching them in \\"real time\\".  There were no thoughts left unspoken, no questions left unanswered, wrapped up nice and tight like an episode of \\"Murder She Wrote\\". I only hope that Quentin Tarentino doesn't decide to add an extra hour to \\"Pulp Fiction\\" to explain what was in the suitcase...
B00008GKEG|5.0|This package is excellent. I only owned it before on VHS taped from television. In this DVD edition, each of the 8 hours has been swelled up to at least 1 hour and 15 minutes, including very complete footage of every Beatles personal appearance on record. The (DTS) sound is stupendous and even the early Beatles songs that were only available in \\"dual stereo\\" have been remixed in a much more acceptable format. What comes consistently through is that (1) John, Paul and to as lesser extent George were no experts or archivists of the Beatles and some of their nerdy fans know a lot more (through collecting bootlegs, probably) about the infinite details of their discography; and (2) Ringo is the most reliable source on the facts and figures, correcting everybody and everything and certainly not devoid of words of wisdom and impressions of his own. My favourite bit has Ringo relating how he realized that the Beatles' success had irreversibly changed their lives (circa 1964): \\"I was at my auntie's for tea and somebody upset the little table where the service was and some tea dripped from my cup to the saucer and everybody was up in arms with 'Oh, no, we can't have this' and fussing and towelling everything off and it hit me, like an arrow through me head, you know!\\" Priceless.
0743244249|1.0|In short: a very bad book by a very good writer.
B00008J4P5|5.0|However, I just want to point out that I believe the supposed *bass* line in &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;, is actually played on a guitar with an octave pedal to give it the bass sound. I could be wrong, but who cares? The album rocks and that's all that matters.
B00005176F|4.0|Some great britpop songs which are simple pop/rock songs even though some of them have weird intentions e.g country house and parklife. This album showcases 10 years worth of work from there very first song 'she's so high' which was released way back in october 1990 to music is my radar from the year 2000. <br />Blur's first big hit 'there's no other way' from way back in 1991 is one of the catchy tunes on here. Not many great songs from there second album but the songs from parklife and great escape are instant britpop classics like parklife, girls and boys, country house, charmless man and the universal.<br />The rest shows stuff from there last two albums like the brilliant 'tender'.
B00006FXB6|5.0|An incredible album from one of America's best rock bands. If you've never seen them live, I highly recommend checking them out, best live band I've ever seen!
B00007G1ZM|4.0|MILDRED PIERCE     (USA - 1945 - black and white)    Aspect ratio: 1.37:1  Theatrical soundtrack: Mono    A downtrodden housewife (Joan Crawford) works hard to become a successful restaurateur in order to accommodate her spoiled daughter (Ann Blyth), leading to betrayal and murder...    The movie which netted Joan Crawford her first and only Oscar and revitalized her flagging career is a top-class melodrama, beautifully constructed by screenwriter Ranald MacDougall (from a novel by James M. Cain) and photographed in moody black and white by ace cameraman Ernest Haller (HUMORESQUE, REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE). Aimed at the market for so-called 'women's pictures' which had emerged during the Second World War, the movie contains all the ingredients of a modern day soap opera, piling the agony on Crawford's tragic character until she's redeemed by a moment of happiness at the very end of the picture.     Crawford is a tower of strength in the leading role, and she's given strong support by an exceptional cast, including Blyth (KISMET, THE HELEN MORGAN STORY) as her vicious, mean-spirited offspring, character actor Jack Carson as a wily businessman who pursues Crawford romantically and loses out to a succession of unsuitable paramours (including a deceptively suave Zachary Scott in one of his first screen appearances), and Eve Arden in a hilarious turn as Crawford's friend and business colleague who doles out the wisecracks like candy (after being leered over by Carson, she retorts: \\"Leave SOMETHING on me, I might catch cold!\\"). Attentive viewers will be amused by some eyebrow-raising dialogue which hints at a lesbian subtext in Arden's character, having somehow managed to elude conservative-minded censors in 1945!     By this stage in his long career, director Michael Curtiz was an old hand at this sort of thing (ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES, CASABLANCA, etc.), and he orchestrates the dramatic highlights with visual aplomb - the confrontations between Crawford and Blyth are particularly strong, though Crawford's stubborn devotion to such an ungrateful daughter seems faintly ridiculous at times - and the sumptuous production values represent Hollywood craftsmanship at its finest. Beautiful, doom-laden score by Max Steiner, incorporating a number of cues heard earlier in NOW, VOYAGER (1942), and vivid, expressionist set designs by Hollywood veteran Anton Grot. Butterfly McQueen (immortalized forever in GONE WITH THE WIND) appears uncredited as Crawford's maid.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|A Beautiful Mind is the touching story of John Nash, the brilliant mathematical genius who suffers from delusional paranoia, better known as schezophrenia. Nash is played beautifully by the talented Russell Crowe, whom I did not think could fit into this role. With his last film being Gladiator where he was buffed, here, he is slouched over and fits into an awkward body and mind. <br />A solid supporting cast gives this movie depth. I won't give away too much because there are a few surprises and no shortage of touching moments. A Beautiful Mind is flawed in that it simplifies Nash's achievements into elementary terms. I saw the extra with Ron Howard visiting Nash and it seemed he had no idea what Nash's equilibrium accomplished or stood for. Ron Howard, however, proves to be a fine emotional director and relies heavily on Russell Crowe's great performance.
B000009MF7|5.0|Krystian Zimerman is one the very few truly exceptional geniuses that can make the piano sing. His colors and tones are of a breathtaking aesthetic beauty as only a Rubinstein or Horowitz were able to produce... French composers appear most suited for him, just look at his Preludes from Debussy. If you love piano, by all means get this CD.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Wow, this movie was awesome.  Christopher Nolan finds a neat way to tell a story...backwards with cause and effect.  Guy Pearce and Joe Pantalonio did a wonderful job but i didnt think Carrie Anne Moss did that good of a job, couldve been better.  A very compelling story.  When I first saw this movie i didnt figure it out at first but then i thought about it and figured it out.  <br />Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man looking for vengeance on the man who raped and murdered his wife, but the problem is that he cant make new memories so he has to write down, take pictures and tattoo himself to capture vital information for him to remember.  Joe Pantaloin plays John Edward Gammel aka Teddy, who plays a vital role in the movie. Carrie Anne Moss plays Natalie, a woman who is supposedly helping Leonard.  <br />Whether or not your a fan of this genre of a movie you should see it anyway, youll be surprised.  Christopher Nolan is now one of my favorite directors.  Go see Insomnia too (Christopher Nolan's second major film)
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|This is an absolute favourite CD of mine. Elvis Costello is a truly talented individual, the way he writes his lyrics is almost like poetry, though much more controvercial. He had (and still has) an amazing voice and an amazing band, the perfect formula for the perfect music.<br />1)No Action<br />2)This Year's Girl- a very Elvis Costello song, it kind of is saying how sex is such an important part of glamour today<br />3)The Beat- I love this song, it is very catchy and fun to listen to<br />4)Pump It Up- a classic. It discusses the whole \\"sex drugs and rock and roll\\" part of fame<br />5)Little Triggers-marked by desperate feeling<br />6)You Belong to Me- One of my favourites, very groovy<br />7)Hand in Hand-an OK song<br />8)I Don't Want to Go to Chelsea- a very humourous song and has a great tune!<br />9)Lip Service-an interesting song, cool tune<br />10)Living in Paradise-another great song!<br />11)Lipstick Vogue-The drums at the beginning of the song are awsome! <br />12)Night Rally- Not my favourite, but a good song none the less<br />13) Radio, Radio- a classic. Discusses how the radio does not appreciate how artists want to express themselves. Too right.<br />An altogether GREAT album that I would recommend to anyone who loves music<br />
B00008977N|5.0|Beautiful, intense and deeply mooving, 'Secret World Live' is one of the greatest concert DVDs ever. Before seeing this DVD, I only knew Peter Gabriel as that somewhat odd guy who used to be with Genesis. This concert blows far beyond what most shows even try for. The music is great, the images are beautiful, and the staging for the show is quite unusual. This disk has awsome sound with DTS and Dolby Digital, as well as some interesting  extras. This is a DVD you will want to play and play and play...
B000024D4R|5.0|An awesome album that has so much meaning in it that it just blows you away! Based on George Orwell's \\"Animal Farm\\", it categorizes humans as either pigs (hypocrites), dogs (backstabbers and money-grubbers), or sheep (followers). What a great album! Each and every song just mesmorizes you! I am surprised that this album is so underrated, it is definately one of Pink Floyd's best.<br />1)Pigs on the Wing part I- A great song with a sort of Folk sound. <br />\\"If you didn't care what happened to me,<BR>And I didn't care for you,<BR>We would zig zag our way through the boredom and pain<BR>Occasionally glancing up through the rain.<BR>Wondering which of the buggars to blame<BR>And watching for pigs on the wing.\\"<br />2)Dogs- a song just under 20 minutes, it is a great song to listen to, for the sounds just change and evolve throughout the song. <br />\\"...And after a while, you can work on points for style.<BR>Like the club tie, and the firm handshake,<BR>A certain look in the eye and an easy smile.<br />You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to,<BR>So that when they turn their backs on you,<BR>You'll get the chance to put the knife in...\\"<br />3)I love this song, though it can get stuck in your head quite easily :) <br />\\"Big man, pig man, ha ha charade you are.<BR>You well heeled big wheel, ha ha charade you are.<BR>And when your hand is on your heart,<BR>You're nearly a good laugh, <BR>Almost a joker,<BR>With your head down in the pig bin,<BR>Saying \\"Keep on digging.\\"<BR>Pig stain on your fat chin.<BR>What do you hope to find.<BR>When you're down in the pig mine.<BR>You're nearly a laugh,<BR>You're nearly a laugh<BR>But you're really a cry...\\"<br />4)Sheep- The song starts out all quiet and serene and then ends in a rock tune, superb! <br />\\"Harmlessly passing your time in the grassland away;<BR>Only dimly aware of a certain unease in the air.<BR>You better watch out,<BR>There may be dogs about<BR>I've looked over Jordan, and I have seen<BR>Things are not what they seem...\\"<br />5)Pigs on the Wing part II- continuing from the first song, it is the same melody just with different lyrics. <br />\\"You know that I care what happens to you,<BR>And I know that you care for me.<BR>So I don't feel alone,<BR>Or the weight of the stone,<BR>Now that I've found somewhere safe<BR>To bury my bone.<BR>And any fool knows a dog needs a home,<BR>A shelter from pigs on the wing.\\"<br />A must have for any Pink Floyd fan!!!!!!
0380778556|5.0|I first read this book in the eighth grade. I was really intrigued because it had a great story line. Now that I'm in college and am taking an adolescent literature class, I have decided to reread the novel in hopes of greater understanding. It is very fascinating. &quot;Rebecca&quot; by Daphne Du Maurier is a mystery about a young girl who dies and leaves her husband widowed. The husband remarries and Rebecca begins to haunt them. The underlying part of the story begins when Rebecca's late husband, Maxim de Winter, makes his second wife, a lady who's name the book never mentions live in Rebecca's shadow.
B00005JLZ9|2.0|This film tried hard, but it kept missing.  The pacing of the film is way, way too fast.  The twists and turns of the story are fired at you bullet-style and I just couldn't keep up.  When the end finally arrived, I STILL didn't know what exactly had happened.  There were critical scenes missing which would have tied it all together.  Too many things didn't add up. Inconsistencies galore.  And I don't know what the other reviewer meant by John Travolta being \\"slim and trim\\" here-- he looked fat and bloated to me, and showing his age.  He always plays the young cocky guy in every one of his films, but in this one he is the washed-up, ex-cocky guy, which I guess is perfect since he can't keep up with the younger crowd now.  Jackson plays the usual loud-mouth character, so there wasn't any real surprise there, either.  All things considered, I recommend skipping it entirely.  There are far better \\"thrillers\\" out there.
B000002GQE|4.0|I got this album shortly after getting into Pink Floyd (starting with Dark Side and The Wall).  After hearing PF's excellent work with the concept album genre, I was quite shocked to discover that Days of Future Passed dated all the way back to 1967, when PF was releasing its very first album Piper at the Gates of Dawn.<br />Although I do not have the same familiarity with the Moody Blues that I do with Pink Floyd, I must say this is a very good concept album indeed.  Judging from what other reviewers have said, it seems that the two favourite tracks are probably &quot;Nights in White Satin&quot; and &quot;Forever Afternoon (Tuesday?)&quot;.  <br />While these are beautiful tracks, and probably the ones that best survived the test of time, I am most moved by the absolutely surreal--and *achingly* short--&quot;Twilight Time&quot;.  This song absolutely soars...the layered vocals are haunting and hypnotic, and one wants to take flight into the world of dreams and joyous anticipation of the next day's promise.  For seven years, the moment when this song is swallowed up by the orchestra has always been one of the most &quot;painful&quot; moments of the album...I never want this song to end, and yet it does far too soon.  Often I wish that this underrated tune could be extended to run forever.  <br />One rather annoying thing about the CD that I own is that there's no track break right before &quot;Twilight Time&quot;, so the only way to reach the song is to fast forward from the beginning of the Evening suite or back from its end (same problem with &quot;Time to Get Away&quot;).  The other drawback of this album, in my mind, is that a few of the songs do become a bit dated.  Although I enjoy it, &quot;Peak Hour&quot; is the one that seems the most tied to the 60's pop sound and least able to transfer to the modern day.<br />I do enjoy the blending between the orchestra and the band, and the quality of the recording itself is shockingly good for its time.  As for the poetry that seems to annoy some people--I enjoy it.  I give this album four stars...although a few songs seem dated in retrospect, its quality is extremely high for its time, and it is an excellent forerunner to concept albums such as those later produced by Pink Floyd and its individual members Roger Waters and Rick Wright.
B000067IZ3|5.0|In the liner notes of Traffic, the director states that his goal was to create a simple picture of the drug trade, not to make a political statement about who was winning.  I think he succeeded masterfully.<br />The one thing that I really enjoyed was the depiction of Law Enforcement, both the Mexican authorities and the Americans.  Benicio Del Toro was wonderful (duh, he won an Oscar) as a mostly-good Mexican cop.  His scene in the pool with the 2 G-men is borderline hilarious.  Don Cheadle and Miguel Ferrer also gave great performances, as the most direct arguments for and against the drug war.<br />The plight of the Douglas character's family was a wonderfully interesting story as well, from permissiveness and hypocrisy of adults, to the slow spiral into addiction and acceptance by youth.  Really a good story.<br />The one thing I thought was far-fetched was the final press conference involving Michael Douglas's character--in the history of government, how many people have ever done that?--but that's my only complaint.  Catherine Zeta-Jones's character is involved in a Cheech & Chong \\"Up in Smoke\\" moment as well, but that's certainly forgiveable.<br />All in all, this is a fantastic film that gives a very even-handed view of the \\"War on Drugs.\\"
1878424505|4.0|I had this book recommended to me by a good friend.  I have now ordered it for my sister and my mother.  When reading, keep the concept in mind the message that it's trying to portray, less the religion aspect.  It is very helpful in giving you a 'reality check'.  Thank you Mr. Ruiz~
B00005OAIE|3.0|I listened to the whole album and even some of his &quot;older stuff&quot; and find his music relaxing.  It's not the best written music you will hear or the best guitar riffs but its definitly better than the stuff they play on the top 40 radio stations. Some &quot;hard hitting&quot; music review people will bash it and say it has no substance but I totally disagree.  John Mayer said it best &quot;Even if I music connects with just one person I have truely accomplished something.&quot; I think Mayer has touched many with mellow lyrics.  My favorite song is &quot;citylove&quot; it sounds different from the rest of the album. While his music is touching the lyrics seem like they need more work.  But all in all John Mayer has something.  I reccomend it to anyone wanting to hear something a little different.
B00005R87Q|3.0|i dunno this movie is borin even wit the cars and all its just a borin movie.
B00008H2LB|3.0|i guess linkin park had lost the essence of their real music. the songs here are less good but also presentable. i just wanted to say to the linkn park that &quot;please make a more good album next time, a better or more better one.&quot; keep rockin'
B000066NW0|4.0|o.k there are already 1412 reviews of this album, so what can i possibly have to say??<br />just that people take music way too seriously, i couldn't care less if this is punk or pop or anything else, it's pretty good music, she has a better voice than any other girl her age currently recording that i know of, the songs aren't the best you'll ever hear but it's the first attempt of a 18 year old - she did a pretty good job!<br />Mobile, I'm With You, Tommorow and Naked are obviously pop songs, love songs, and it's all been said before - but Avrils never said it before - the songs are written about whats she's be through - even if you don't like this album i'd give her some major credit for co-writing it herself and being so honest with her image, whatever this is - it's not manufactured pop, so give her a chance.
B00008DDXC|5.0|I've seen the movie in fact I've bought a local CD of the movie.  but I intend to make a long time collection of this series so that I can share it with my children and maybe grandchildren.  That's why I still ordered the DVD from amazon.com.  <br />It is a nice movie to watch with my family.  We can discuss it and share the great experience.  The movie, though so many interesting parts been omitted from its original story, still have a great fun with lots of laughter to share and some emotional parts that one would prefer to watch it alone.  It pull lots of emotions from the audience, the joy, suspense, irritated, superior, pity, fun etc.  out of us.<br />My children love it and I hope they could learn emotions and the facts of life that lies behind each of the characters.
B00006879E|5.0|WOW! all i can say. Maroon 5 is truly an original and talented band. They go from funk rock tunes, to jazz sounding piano solos in \\"sunday morning.\\" they have a truly unique sound. Many different music genres mixed on this cd. Great flow to the album, you can listen to it over and over and never get tired of it. I heard this band the other day on the radio and went out and bought the album and haven't stopped listening since. Maroon 5 is truly a great band, and the cd is well worth the money. SO buy it now!
B00008J4P5|3.0|No doubt the white stripes are a great band. The album starts off great with Seven Nation Army. Black Math, Ball and Biscuit, The Hardest Button to Button, Hypnotize, and the Air Near My Fingers are the stand out tracks. When Jack goes to a more folky style, the songs are weak, both lyrically and musically. I can say that the 6 songs mentioned above are all great. The failure comes with the &quot;quieter&quot; songs. De Stijl, though many in this reviewing board have dubbed it as below par, I think is their best album. Elephant is definitely a good album and I'm happy I purchased it, but the rocking songs show the White Stripes branching into new directions.
B00005JLSE|2.0|This Broadway-to-screen musical is one I could have lived without. Its winning the academy awards makes one wonder. Obviously, it is not my kind of music. <br />Roxie would have been a smash at the Roxy Theater. From the ads, I had expected her to be a copy of Marilyn Monroe; instead, she was Shirley MacLaine as Sweet Charity. <br />In my opinion, the best part of this strange combined crime story/musical was the bittersweet piece by Amos (John C. Reilly). There were actually only three big numbers all of which expended a great deal of energy and talent. <br />The actor who played the judge was perfect for that part --liked the portrait of the blindfolded Miss Justice behind the judge in courtroom. <br />Richard Gere has aged well, but can he really tap dance?  This trial (reminiscent of the Scopes fiasco of times gone by) proved that all criminal attorneys must be showmen at times. <br />That was a sleazy time in America's musical history; it was a decandent era as shown so well in THE CAT'S MEOW, about the Hearst coverup of the mysterious death on his yacht, which has similar music but no big performances. <br />The premise of a crime story turned into a musical may not be new, but it was strange going.
B000002H33|5.0|Now, there are more than 500 reviews for this album, but here I go nonetheless. From the acoustic intro which is followed by basically the same riff but ominously played on electric, to the very last note, this album is a Metal lover's dream come true. Nothing to fault here. The powerful riffs, masterfully arranged songs, to the dark lyrical themes - everything is grade-A METAL. Anyone even slightly into Metal must listen to this one. In this day and age of poser bands and rap-rockers, an album such as this one should not be (will not be) forgotten. Save a few exceptions (Tool, Mudvayne, Deftones, Candiria) most of what is today called Rock or Metal pales miserably in comparison to this (link and limp = sad). Those who don't know why most reviews here are enthusiastically positive do not know one bit about Metal at all. In 1988, all I had ever listened to was what was &quot;hip&quot; at the time - Madonna, Michael Jackson, and later, Motley Crue, Bon Jovi,etc. I still remember the feeling I got when I hit play on my walkman and out came &quot;Battery&quot; - I got chills down my spine! Electricity ran through every fiber in me. I was revealed a new world of music, and I never looked back from then on. The Bottom line is: Master of Puppets is undeniably a monumental achievement in the history of Metal. No one can deny that, ever.
B00008MNYS|5.0|I recently purchased Robbie's new album Escapology and feel in love with it instantly.  Usually when you buy an album you have to listen to it a couple of times before it moves you, however after just listening to Robbie's Escapology CD once I new he had a major hit on his hand.  This album seems to be more personal then his other albums to date.  It seems that since he is a well established artists he was able to experiment more with the lyrics on this new album.  It does have your ballads however they have the personal Robbie William's touch which we all have learned to love.  One of the tracks that jumps out or stands out is The Worlds Most Handsome Man.  I really liked that track among others however that one seems to stand out.  At this time I take time out to congradulate Mr. Williams on his recent recording deal giving him the honors of signing the most lucrative recording contract since M. Jackson.  The good news for his established fan base and future fans to come is that we will have the opportunity to listen to new music and lyrics from this talented Brit.  Buy his new CD it is Great.
B000084T18|5.0|This cd is the best I ever heard. Every song is great, from start to finish. The best songs are Blood Hound, P.I.M.P., Many Men, If I Can't, and Don't Push Me. 50 cent is the next big thing!
B00008H2LB|5.0|I'm only 15, but I recently bought this c.d. in Florida a few days ago and I never regretted it, I've listened to it fully about 9 times already and it still rocks! Look, don't listen to those people that are putting down this music just because it is different from Hybrid Theory and that they changed their style a bit . Me honestly, I like that they changed it cause I beleive that it shows more of LP's potential. If you are into this kind of music, then I highly recommend that you pick a copy of meteora soon! you won't be wasting your money over this.
B000069AUI|5.0|Its hard for a more mellow band such as this one to catch my attention, but it caught it and didnt let go. The music just sucks you in. Its one of those albums you can just loose yourself in. You turn it on and forget everything. Simple relaxing melodies and lyrics that everyone could relate to. A wonderful album.

B00008GKEG|5.0|I am a HUGE Beatles fan and if I didn't know any better, I'd call myself the number one fan. I watched these 8 films and was blown away by all the things I didn't know! I thought I knew everything about the Beatles through books and songs and interviwes and other films but this fed me knowledge unbeknownst to me! The Anthology series changed the way I thought about The Beatles and made me like them to an even larger extent if possible. I'm extremley excited for it to finally be on DVD and I will surley buy it. I recomend this to Beatles fans at any high or low.
B000065V9P|3.0|Even though many years went by after Gabriel's huge hit album SO (Sledgehammer, In Your Eyes, Big Time) this album still feels like it was pretty much tossed off in a month or two, and those months must have been fairly uninspired ones.  <br />Not much on the album feels new, and Gabriel's vocals, which  have always had a lanquid, sad quality, just feel tired and uninterested...most of the time.<br />KISS THE FROG is the greates of his few \\"funny\\" songs, like BIG TIME.  Yes, it could be a musical version of the story of THE FROG PRINCE, but when he begs the princess to be nice to him and to \\"Kiss the Frog,\\" I think any adult listening knows he's NOT talking about a frog.  Since this is a family site, I can't say what he IS talking about kissing, but suffice it to say, the double entendre in this song is priceless.  It's like Gabriel has written a really dirty limerick!  <br />STEAM is also a blast.  Upbeat and full of fun (though somewhat pointless) lyrics.  DIGGING IN THE DIRT has moments of great evocativeness, but mostly (as with the rest of the album) we feel we've heard it all before.<br />I normally just LOVE his work, but this album is at the bottom of my list.  (But if you haven't heard KISS THE FROG, you MUST find a way to get ahold of it!!)
B000069HP6|4.0|Since 1977's \\"Star Wars\\", Hollywood has tried desperately to duplicate its success, 1978's \\"Battlestar Galactica\\", 1980's \\"Flash Gordon\\" & this one, 1979's \\"The Black Hole\\" & \\"Alien\\" as well the first \\"Star Trek\\" movie all rode the coatails of SW in the late 70's & early 80's, funny how Hollywod continues to ignore George Lucas but still, till this day tries to duplicate him with big-budget summer movies, enough about that, on to the review, like many reviewers here, I too liked this one as a kid, & bought it on DVD as well, & as an adult, I still found it to be entertaining, as well as BG & FG above, it still holds up well I think, this has got to be one of the creepiest Sci-Fi movies ever made, especially the Cygnus, an interstellar ship that could pass for a haunted house, with many dark corridors & window paines galore, Maximillian Schell is Dr. Reinheart who has lived in exile on this ship for the last 20 years alone, only with his demonic Robot & faceless people(creepy), soon a survey ship(The Palomino) that is surveying a nearby Black Hole arrives & its crew soon discover the ship that is motionless & dark, soon it lights up & the crew investigates its origins, only to discover that this is a lost NASA ship thought to be destroyed 20 years ago, as they investigate, they discover a dark & sinister secret about the ship & the fate of its crew some 20 years earlier that soon has them fighting for their lives as Reinheart decides he is going to take the ship itself into the Black Hole & hopefully discover its origins, this is a well done movie, with a unique & interesting story, that plays out very well, the set designs & special effects are good for a movie made in 1979, however, I am not sure it looks real, the uniforms worn by the crew of the Palomino don't really look all that different than today's astronaunts, neither does Reinheart's clothes, but the cinemataghopy does look somewhat dated in terms of today's Sci-Fi, but not many Sci-Fi movies since have had the visual eye candy this movie has, except maybe the SW Prequel films, which in some ways make this one look like a 60's film, the DVD itself is clear & sharp for a movie this old, which makes it worth owning if you like this one!!
B000065VA1|4.0|Far and away Gabriel's biggest commercial success, this is a terrific album by almost any standard (except in comparison to some earlier, even more brilliant Gabriel albums).  The production work is lush and detailed, a hallmark of Gabriel's incredible attention to detail and interest in layering sound upon sound.  And he put to use relatively new digital technology to create a sound of unusual crispness and clarity for its time.  <br />RED RAIN  A very moody, even creepy piece, featuring oustanding vocal work.  Evokes his prior albums, which relied heavily on creating moods of dread or drama.  The finale, where the song gets quieter and quieter uses that fading to create a feeling of great sadness.<br />SLEDGEHAMMER A huge commercial success, and one of Gabriel's friskiest songs to date.  It still holds up well (and of course, the video was a CLASSIC).  Shows Gabriel's terrific sense of humor and his \\"dirty\\" side, but it's only dirty if you want to dig for it.  Most it's upbeat and fun to sing along with.  A happy song!!<br />DON'T GIVE UP  A duet with Kate Bush, whose vocals are fantastic.  It's a shame she never got the attention she deserved.  Gabriel plays an out-of-work man in England, falling into dispair, and Bush represents family and loved ones offering words of encouragement.  It's a sweet song, tinged greatly with sadness.  It makes a social commentary without resorting to anything but very personal commentary reflecting on the damage done by unemployment.  Bush enjoins Gabriel to not give up and reminds him \\"somewhere there's a place...a place where you belong.\\"  The song is full of love and yet sadness as well, as though we know that Gabriel's character is probably beyond feeling good about himself again.  It's powerful, quiet song.<br />THAT VOICE AGAIN  Gabriel often sang songs in the first person about people with, shall we say, mental problems or at least, obsessive/compulsive disorder.  Add this somewhat mediocre song to the list.<br />IN YOUR EYES  One of the most romantic pop songs EVER written.  It was a great song even before John Cusack made in legend in SAY ANYTHING.  It speaks directly to the heart of how a great love in your life can transport you.  Gabriel's vocals are yearning, the lyrics are mushy in the best possible way, and the backing chorus of an almost tribal quality give the song a buoyancy that's just a hoot.  The opposite of RED RAIN, which gets slower and quieter as it builds in power, this song gets faster and more festive as it builds its power.<br />MERCY STREET  A rumination of the sad life of poet Anne Sexton.  Although we don't get most of the references in the song (I assume you need to know more about her life and her work) the song nonetheless builds sumptuous \\"word pictures\\" that evoke a mood.  If you can, listen to this one with headphones...it really gets into your head.<br />BIG TIME  Another hit song.  Another upbeat tune.  This one is a bit of a social satire...I can almost imagine The Kings coming up with something similar if they had written A WELL-RESPECTED MAN about 20 years later.  The lyrics are funny and self-effacing.  <br />WE DO WHAT WE'RE TOLD  Sorry to say it, but this song is mostly filler, and is the reason I can't give the album 5 stars.  Pointless and dull.<br />THIS IS THE PICTURE  A fun trifle, done with Laurie Anderson.  They both have quirky voices and quirky sensibilities, and they have crafted this ditty strictly to amuse.  (The song didn't even appear on the original album...it was a B-side).  Not a classic, by any means, but I dare you not to smile while listening.<br />I prefer a couple of other Gabriel albums over this one, but this is his most accessible and is quite excellent.  It's a great introduction to the man's work and should be part of any well-rounded collection.
B00008CLOA|3.0|I give the actual cd a 5 star. I love Pink Floyd, and this classic explosion of music (at the time) produced by Alan Parsons. Although Alan didn't help reproduce this amazing cd, I still bought it. The CD sounds great, better than the original! But my problem lies there within the second layer of the cd... the SACD format with DSD decoding... its jsut not right! I mean, its nice of them to try to push a new format into the mix... but why this one, why this cd? I have a nice system I've worked for to build! Now they release this, and I can't play it, a big dissapointment for me.. and thats why the rateing I gave it stands! I don't think that it would have made that much of a difference to record this in DTS! Thats it, thats my major complaint.... In order to play SACD music you have to buy a DVD player that is SACD compatible (...), after that, I dont know if the stereo has to be compatible to that format...!! I hope not! I just dont have that kinda money to listen to one single cd!!!
B00006YXEK|5.0|This album is a hoot!! The lyrics are clever, it's very upbeat, and George sounds great. And maybe I've got a short memory, but I'm not sure his guitar has ever sounded more relaxed and fluid. <br />In the past, some of his more overtly \\"spiritual\\" songs have often been a bit heavy-handed, but the title tune here, which has spirtual overtones, is really quite lovely. It's the final tune, and has some \\"sad\\" chanting at the end, which fades out. Yes, knowing that it was George's final song really makes the emotional impact of that song quite strong. You really miss him at that point.<br />But the nice thing is that even though you know he was dieing when he made this, you hardly ever think about it when listening. It's just fun. It may be one of the best Beatle solo albums. If you enjoyed George's CLOUD NINE or the Traveling Wilbury's, you will like this. <br />His songs are all well written, but for me a real treat was his cover of an OLD Harold Arlen tune, THE DEVIL AND THE DEEP BLUE SEA. <br />The DVD that comes with is fairly short and his hardly essential to enjoying the album.  If you're a big Harrison fan, it's probably a must-own, but if you're a casual fan, save the money. The rest of the extras (a sticker and a guitar pick, all in a cool black case) are nothing special.
B000066NW0|2.0|so heres unother teen singer who claims to be different   from the others but too bad, her difference aint to convincing...<BR>so wat if shes a tom boy, her music does sound girly still...<BR>...sketer boi's okay...but i feel she still has a long way to go.....for now...this cd isn't worth buying...so letgo of it!
0060012218|4.0|GEOGRAPHY CLUB, Brent Hartinger's debut novel, is a realistic coming-of-age story. It deals with a high school boy named Russel who realizes he isn't the only one at school questioning his sexuality. He along with a few others want to talk more about it, but are scared to speak openly or to create an Alliance that everyone would know about. Instead, they form the Geography Club, thinking that no one will want to join something that boring and that their secrets will be safe.<br />This very quick read takes an honest look at one young man coming to terms with who he is. The protagonist is not infalliable; the story is not preachy. You want to hug Russel once second and slap him the next as he goes through the ups and downs of high school. At times, he caves in to peer pressure; at others, he stands up for the truth.<br />Ultimately, this book is not about being gay or straight, being a boy or a girl, but about being who you are. We've all felt alienated at one point or another, and we've all felt alone when surrounded by people. This book should be an eye-opener for students and adults alike.
B000069KE0|5.0|I've already reviewed CHICAGO (scroll downwards) hence the 5 star rating.  I just want to clear up the negativity about the &quot;bad&quot; sound - there is a reason.  Sometime in the 1970's, there was a fire at Caribou Studios in Colorado (where all the Chicago master tapes were kept) and out of all the Chicago albums, THIS ONE saw its master tape destroyed.  Yes - gone.  Hence, the dub of the master tape that appears on the CD.  If there was a better sounding tape, Rhino and Chicago would have found it by now (after all it's 2003) and used it here.  I'm sure they regret it, but there you are.  So if you're waiting for the 1st generation copy of CHICAGO to appear on CD, you'll be waiting forever.  Like Terry Kath, it is gone.  However, the sound isn't THAT bad and at least the production team had the foresight to make reference dubs of the album.  To quote Mick &amp; Keith: &quot;You can't always get what you want&quot;, but you'll get what you NEED here.  Cheers...
B00005JLKN|4.0|...and the Hannibal saga goes on. The third installment of this trilogy had a few surprises up its sleeve: notably, the incredible cast, secondly that it's a very worthy continuation of the other two (a lot of people were expecting it to fail dramatically). <BR>     This time around it's Lecter back to his coaching methods again as he directs an FBI agent (Edward Norton) to find the &quot;tooth fairy&quot; killer (Ralph Fiennes).<BR>   The new elements in this film compared to its predecessors are that it contains more fear, more intimidation, and less dosages of dark humor. All these work in a positive way: they are not overblown out of proportion, in fact the film is superbly balanced throughout.<BR>   And, speaking of balance, the biggest trick is balancing big time actors like Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes and of course Hopkins himself. Indeed, it's not Hopkins that dominates the proceedings here (even though it's impossible to even think of ignoring his presence) but Fiennes portraying the psychoting serial killer that the &quot;doctor&quot; is helping to track down. Fiennes gives a memorable (and tone setting) performance in one of his very best roles of his career.<BR>    Fiennes's performance helps shift the focus point from Lecter in an overwhemling way. Aided by Norton's subtle but ultra-convincing acting the whole film becomes a classic not only for fans of the Hannibal trilogy but for fans of the genre in general. Keitel is great in his rather small role and it goes without saying that Hopkins maintains his reputation as one of the all-time classic cinematic psychos.<BR>    The script is very well-crafted and maintains the suspense and the &quot;edginess&quot; from beginning to end, but what really does the trick are the dark optics that accompany it particularly the sequences involving Fiennes and his horrifying deeds.<BR>    As it has been mentioned already &quot;Red Dragon&quot; can be viewed either as a sequel to &quot;Hannibal&quot; ora prequel to the previous two parts. But even if viewed as a sequel it's actually incredible when you think that it could've been a disaster especially because of the hype prevailing the other two films before it. It's far from that, it's simply a great film.
B00005JM93|1.0|The recent acclaim for Gaspar Noe's new film \\"Irreversible\\" is clearly a case of the emperors new clothes.  The controversial film starts off as an assault on the senses but quickly fizzles out and becomes an exercise in tedium.  Due to the reverse order storytelling gimmick, this top heavy film falls victim to its own theme - time destroys everything - and ultimately collapses under its own weight.  Aside from the early scenes of brutality (a graphic head bashing & the infamous 10 anal rape) the film offers little else - least of all anything resembling complexity or psychological insight.  Instead, Noe presents scene after scene of meaninglessly contrived after-the-fact foreshadowing, self indulgent film student aesthetics and laughably amateur (not to mention excruciatingly dull) actor workshop improvisations - some of which make the endless rape scene feel subliminal.  What Noe seems to be aiming for is a kind of Peckinpah/Cassavetes hybrid, but what he attains is the cinematic equivalent of anesthesia.  Don't believe the hype - the emperor wears Noe clothes.
B00008DDSC|3.0|It's a shame that this movie is so good for so long.  The final fifteen minutes is utterly unbelieveable.  It's as if a different crew came in to fill in story for the end.  The first hour and a half is really good.  Both leads sizzle in great roles.  The atmosphere is excellent and teeters on the edge of edgy drama and blackest black comedy.  The entire package is marred, however, by a dissapointing third act.  The film flows along and suddenly stops on a dime and changes direction completely.  It turns the kind of bizzare that makes you scratch your head and say,&quot;why'd they do that?&quot;  Really worth seeing (especially for the performances) but could've been wrapped up into a tighter package.
B00004XOWM|2.0|I liked this CD way back when it came out but compared to other rock albums this album lacks big time.  Fred enjoys using MF in his lyrics for no reason.  I mean I could give a care about the language in the albums I listen to but this guy was just saying it to say it.  The songs are mediocre and better left unheard.  If you want rock go buy any of KoRn's albums.
B000001IPL|5.0|Its the classic Punk album with songs: Gotta Get Away, Bad Habit, SelfEsteem, Come Out And Play(Gotta Keep'em Seperarated).  Get this now-its an \\"oldie\\" but it still holds up as one of the best Punk albums out there!!
B00008AWOD|4.0|It took me a few listens to fully take in this whole cd and I enjoy it more with every listen. Not the best of albums but pretty strong from beginning to end.
B00000GAIW|3.0|I've never understood the facination some people have for this CD.  It's good but definetly not Tull's best. I prefer \\"This Was\\", \\"Stand Up\\", and \\"Benefit\\" over this. The beginning of the end for Jethro Tull, it was all downhill after this.  Despite the tedious lyrics, Martin Barr kicks [booty] and the rhythm section of Clive Bunker and Glenn Cornick is splendid.
6300248569|4.0|I first saw the film about 20 years ago, and after having enjoyed -very much- the A&E version decided to buy this one and compare.   Each one is good in its own way. In general I like the actors better in this version, Elizabeth Garvie is my Miss Bennet, although I wished she showed a bit more rage in the first proposal version. All the \\"negative\\" characters -Mr Collins, the Bingley sisters, Mrs Bennet and Lady Catherine- are more natural here and truer to the book. Mrs Bennet is equally silly, but you do not wish to beat her to death every time she appears. The only one I didnt like at all is Mr Darcy.   Good looking, but too stiff. OK, I know the character is haughty, but he lacks sparkle. Except for the last 5 minutes he is completely expresionless.  The A&E version actor is far better.<BR>As for the script, the story is more static in this version, but the dialogues are delightful and truer to the novel. The zinging between Mr. and Mrs Bennet and Between Mrs Bennet and Lady Lucas is priceless. The only think I don't agree with is the ending. Just terrible. The first time I saw it I thought it was a defect of my video version but no. Thet's why I haven't given them an extra star.
B00005AREQ|5.0|Now this here album was the turning point in my musical preferences.  I grew up listening to delta blues and Chicago style electric blues. First heard Mr Beck on the &quot;Over, Under, Sideways, Down&quot; album by the Yardbirds and was immediately drawn to the wildly ecclectic influences of his playing. Far Eastern themes, loud explosive chords, lightning fast runs up and down the fretboard. He was like nothing I'd ever heard before.  Blow by Blow is a landmark album in the history of not just rock but electric guitar in general.  Beck reached new heights that would culminate with the follow-up, Wired.  Jeff Beck may be the greatest electric guitarist of all time.  Buy this album and find out for yourself.
B0000029DD|5.0|Jeff Buckley was the real deal--talented beyond all good taste, eclectic in scope, and an extremely wonderful songwriter, with a bent toward forgiveness in lyric and tune.  There are a couple of tracks on Grace I never liked, but the standouts were so humane that it's pointless to bicker.      Humanity, in fact, overflows from \\"Last Goodbye\\" and the best song on this work, \\"Lover, You Should Have Come Over\\".  The latter is like one long cry, escalating in a powerful ascending guitar that melds perfectly with his high, thin voice. It would be maudlin coming from any other songwriter; Buckley's obvious sincerity elevates it to the sublime.      There was so much good--and goodness--in his first work, so much promise and virtuosity, that I remember some critics being snarky about \\"Grace\\": did he really have to put Nina Simone's \\"Lilak Wine\\" on, or sustain that last note on Leonard Cohen's \\"Alleluiah\\" so long, or sing so high and so well in the obscure Britton tune \\"Corpus Cristi Carol\\"?  I mean, it was almost showing off!    Yes, he did, and thank goodness he did, because besides the posthumusly-released \\"My Sweetheart the Drunk\\", this was his only finished work.  And it's beautiful.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Man, I've been reading these bad reviews and I'm shocked. Parents whining that it's \\"too scary.\\" If you recall, the rating PG stands for PARENTAL GUIDANCE. You're lucky this movie was of class and didn't include any foul language (like many PG movies...). What REALLY makes me laugh is that most of America is left-wing liberals, who make it almost possible to see nudity on cable. If you're going to whine, have a good reason, don't just bash a beautiful movie because of your ignorance. I agree that it wasn't the BEST anime ever, but I wasn't expecting it to be. I walked in thinking it would be a expertly animated Japanese fantasy, so I knew it would be a little odd. Like it or not, this movie has great animation, although sometimes the voices seem TOO loud (Chihiro's mainly). Overall a great PARENTAL GUIDANCE movie, which is tamer than The Goonies, which is also a PG movie filled with bad language.
B000089RVX|4.0|First of all, when I heard their song (from Daredevil) as I was browsing in Best Buy, I thought it was a great song and wanted to get it right away.  The hard guitar and her strong voice just had a strange combination and sounded interesting.  I agree with some others that their sound is quite unique.<br />I have lstened to some other bands that another reviewer refered to as being better like:<BR>Lacuna Coil - The girl has a nice voice, the guy doesn't (Sugarcubes anyone?) and they risk sounding like bad 80s heavy metal sometimes.<BR>The Gathering - Not too bad either but they aren't as hard rock.<BR>Flowing Tears - Pretty bad if you ask me...<br />...and still I think this band is better.  Although this album isn't that earth-shattering because some of the songs sound too much like each other, her voice, again, is great.  Sounds a lot like Sarah MacLachlan.
B000002H2H|4.0|At first, i was sceptical when my son bought this cd. But after hearing him play it, despite the song subjects, i learned that these people were great musicians. This is is better than my son getting some parental advisory cd, like Marylin Manson or Korn. I think this cd is good enough to listen to if you are mature enough to understand the meanings of lyrics.
B00005IC2H|5.0|i was driven to write a review on this album, and now as i sit here with the task of trying to sum this up in words, i realize im in way over my head.<BR>what i will say tho is that upon first hearing this album, i was completely entranced, and wanted nothing but to own my own copy that very night.<BR>ever since purchasing this album, it has become sort of the musical backbone to my entire life for the past few years... i go through different musical phases, i like this band, i like that band, but it inevitably keeps coming back to Sigur Ros.  true beauty transcends all emotion and perception, and this music transcends even that.  the lack of understandable lyrics in my opinion adds so much depth to the music itself because it frees up the mind to appreciate the music as a whole, as a living thing, rather than listening to the music and at the same time trying to catch and comprehend the word meanings.<BR>i've also had the great privilege to have seen sigur ros twice in concert...and all i can say is that the shows were... well, practically a spiritual experience...if you like the cd(s), you'll be drawn to shudders and tears by the live show.<br />all in all, this album is the epotome of what one could call a 'musical landscape'.  except it takes you far beyond the landscape, through vast reigons of space, through the inner-depths of the soul, and back<br />well, sorry for rambling, but i tend to do that with things i feel passionately about
B000002572|5.0|More than a feeling! This song title explains the monster ballads that flow of Boston's first self-titled release. <br />While other folks wax elequently with a song by song analysis of this timeless album I will keep it simple.<br />Boston will always have a special place in my collection.
B000000WJZ|5.0|After listening to Siamese Dream for the first time, nearly ten years after it's realease, I couldn't help but wonder why I had never heard of this album before. Siamese Dream contains some of the most imaginative and innovative guitar riffs of it's time. Songs such as &quot;Cherub Rock&quot; and &quot;Hummer&quot; have riffs the listener will always remember. Each song is a different musical experience. From screaming guitar solos to &quot;Disarm&quot;, with an orchestral arrangment, Siamese Dream is one of the most melodic and diverse cd's to ever be recorded and will always be one of the best ever. If you like any kind of music at all, you will like this cd. Believe me and get your hands on this cd.
B00006879E|5.0|I first heard Maroon5 right after my long term boyfriend had left me for another girl.    I heard harder to Breath on the radio, after that I went and picked up the cd and it has not left my cd player yet.  The songs are far from the ordinary tunes that get played over and over again on MTV.  This is great orignal stuff.
0380018179|5.0|I was first introduced to The Thorn Birds when the miniseries was run on television for the second time (I believe this was around 1993), and after seeing it, I had to buy the book.  This book is captivating and involving.  Once you get started, you will not want to stop reading until you've finished.  <br />The book is much better than the miniseries in many ways, because you get to know exactly what the characters are thinking and you get to know the characters themselves very well.<br />The story is tragic, yes, but I think the most tragic thing about it is that we readers cannot live with as much passion and desire and spirit as these incredible characters do every moment of their lives.  If you read this book, I doubt you'll be able to look at the world or yourself in the same way again.
0385474547|4.0|This novel tells a story of a burly tribesman in an African locale.  The name Okonkwo, has been heard on the tip of many tongues throughout the tribe of Ib.   They speak of the main character's reputation as a powerful wrestler, wealthy husband and farmer. Okonkwo's only inspiration is to overshadow his father's mockery and feeble attempts for success.  This book contains exceptional insights into the African culture, before and during the slavery undertaking. Author Chinua Achebe, sheds no expense to guide the reader through various African customs, jargon and economy. Although younger readers may find some situations confusing, it is still interesting to follow the characters described in the book as they are entwined to the African way of life. One interesting aspect is when Chinua narrators the role of women in the tribe. To have more than one woman, signifies a man's wealth and power. Also defining his control over his household and property.  The wives are expected to fulfill every household chore, along with caring for numerous children. This book is a good read for anyone that expresses an interest in history or culture, although the ending won't surprise you.
B00008AOS5|4.0|Based upon the wonderful, well-written novel \\"Red Dragon\\" by Thomas Harris, this is a superior and chilling thriller. Grim and gripping, it features Edward Norton in the role of troubled, retired FBI agent, Will Graham, who is called back to service in order to track down a bizarre serial killer, known as the \\"Tooth Fairy\\". It appears that Graham has the uncanny ability to get into a killer's mindset and figure out what his next move might be. It is as if he and the killer become one. In his preparation for this, Graham even consults the imprisoned Hannibal Lecter (yes, THE Hannibal Lecter), deliciously played by  Anthony Hopkins. Unfortunately for Graham, Hannibal has not forgotten that Graham was responsible for his changed circumstances.<br /><br />It is Hannibal Lecter, after all, who was the catalyst for Will Graham's retirement. The viewer is treated to scenes of Lecter's life, before he was revealed to be Hannibal the Cannibal, one of the sickest serial killers ever to strike. The viewer sees the renowned psychiatrist in his milieu as an erudite, cultured, and wealthy patron of the arts. A noted gourmand, Dr. Lecter liked nothing better than to give intimate dinner parties for the favored few. Of course, some of the ingredients used for his dinners were best left unsaid. It was nice to see the always excellent John Rubenstein in the small role of a dinner guest, heaping accolades upon Hannibal for his dinner parties.<br /><br />The movie is compelling and, at all times, gripping. Anthony Hopkins reprises his career defining role and steals the show (Really, Hannibal Lecter has become all but a cottage industry for him!). With a twinkle in his eye, he is, in his low key way, deliciously malevolent. Edward Norton, one of the best young actors around, gives a decent and sensitive portrayal of Will Graham, the angst ridden former FBI agent and profiler, but lacks the grittiness and hard-edged veneer that the role really demands. He also simply looks  too young and soft for the role.  Ralph Fiennes gives a fine performance as the tormented Francis Dolarhyde, but his portrayal is hampered by the fact that too little is revealed in the film about what makes him tick.<br /><br />Emily Watson affectingly plays a blind woman who becomes romantically involved with Francis Dolarhyde. It is her involvement with him that helps bring the film to its stunning conclusion. Moreover, Ms. Watson is a wonderfully talented British actress who manages to get her American accent down pat. Good performances by Harvey Keitel, as Graham's former boss, and Mary Louise Parker, as Graham's wife, round out this fine, ensemble cast.<br /><br />This film is a taut, unnerving psychological thriller that is subject to comparison to its 1986 predecessor \\"Manhunter\\". Having seen both, I call it a draw. This current version had a bigger budget, so obviously it has better production values. Also, the opening scenes in the current version are more interesting than those in the 1986 one. Music, however, was used to much better effect in the earlier version. Moreover, the final scenes in the earlier version were much better than in this later version, as they were much more suspenseful. Both films, however,  are well worth watching. Do yourself a favor and view both. Then,  judge for yourself.d soft for the role.

0385504209|1.0|Rave reviews from Publishers Weekly and BookSense 76 lead me to believe that \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" was just the thing for fans of intelligent thrillers by Arturo Perez-Reverte or Wilton Barnhardt's \\"Gospel.\\"  It is just the opposite. Those are the sort of readers who will be bored stiff by this novel's cardboard characters, cornball plot, and melodramatic writing. \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is rife with factoids about Church history, the symbolism of the pentacle, Opus Dei, and Fibonnaci numbers which are pretty interesting and propel the plot for awhile, but showing off tidbits of knowledge is no substitute for actually creating believeable fiction.<br />This book will work better as a movie (its obviously intended purpose) when actors can flesh out the characters, a director can create some atmosphere, and the factoids may sound profound and less like a lecture. More intelligent, more fun, and more exciting time can be spent rereading \\"Gospel,\\" or discovering that big juicy book for the first time.
0385504209|5.0|I just finished reading the Da Vinci Code and I think it was one of the best intellectual thrillers I have read in a long time.  Although I don't consider myself much of a history buff, I thoroughly enjoyed the mix of history, art, religion, murder and suspense.  I was amazed at the way Dan Brown put all of the puzzle pieces together.  I find myself searching the internet for more information on Da Vinci and his theories.  Are any of these theories true????
B00005RYLE|5.0|Ever so often, after sometimes years of weak Hollywood Horror Movies along comes a kick but Horror Flick that shakes up the whole Genre.  Almost always a low to NO budget independent film, some young/new director will make his mark, and push the envelope a little farther.  Movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Night of the living dead, Halloween, Re-animator, and this small but gutsy little epic, which is one of my favorites, The Evil Dead.  Group of friends, weekend trip, small cabin in the woods, \\"Complete and total body dismemberment\\" What more can I say, what more could you want from a Movie!  How about some inventive camera work, and that first scene at the cabin with the swing banging against the house, sweet! Oh and lets not forget the tree rape scene, Wow, talk about \\"WOOD\\" Last but not least this baby introduced Bruce Camble to the World...  The sequels were very good but a little two much comedy for my taste. As for the DVD It's self (this is about the 10th version on DVD) it looks and sounds way better than this film has a right to.  Should be in ever Horror Fans collection!! Required veiwing Horror 101....
B00007AJGH|5.0|Reviewing the movie: \\"Who frameed Roger Rabbit\\" (without the question mark, because it's bad luck) was the \\"E.T.\\" from the end of the eighties; when this movie was released, almost there was no CGI graphics in the movies (the \\"Digital era\\" began at the mid of the 90's); this movie was a land mark in the way of the making special effects and animation (every single animated frame was made with pencil and ink -- everything was drawed), but not only that, it's the first (and maybe the only and last) movie that brings together the Looney Tunes and the \\"Mouse Pack\\" among other Toons.<br />This movie was directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump) and produced by Steven Spielberg (Jaws, The Schindler's list) and it won 4 Academy Award (with a special achievement award for animation direction).<br />The plot is about a detective, Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) that must help a Toon to clean his name of the charge of homicide, this toon is Roger Rabbit (Chales Fleischer); in this world, all the humans and the toons coexist hand in hand (even the toons that we saw in all the animated shorts from the 40's and 50's were actor under the contract of the many Hollywood studios); however, all the toons are segregated in a place named Toontown (here, we can see a couple of references of the racism that US lived in the post-war era).<br />The movie is rated PG, because it's sexual innuendo and the mature subject (i feel that this movie is more oriented to adults than kids)<br />Reviewind the DVD: This package contains 2 dvd: Family Friendly (with the Full screen format of the movie and the Roger Rabbit's animated shorts, among other kids oriented to kids, like games and puzzles) and For Enthusiasts (with the widescreen version, deleted scene (the famous \\"Pig Head\\"), comparisions before and after the toons where added to the film (specifically the Toontown secuence), production notes, audio documentary, featurettes, etc); the sound is very good (THX certified... evena speaker of mine fall down in the \\"THX sound\\"); the case of the dvd was something like a card-box (pretty, but i prefer the plastic cases); in the foreign language support, i feel that it could be better, the movie includes french, english and spanish tracks, but lacks form spanish subtitles (i think that it has french subtitles, but i'm not sure), the worst part is that all the extras has no subtitles at all! (not even english subtitles) so if you don't know english, you're going to suffer a little.<br />Anyway, this DVD is much better that the first (that was released a couple of years, and if you love this movie, you'll love the dvd!
B000077VT7|5.0|This film is loosely based upon Robert Ludlum's book \\"The Bourne Identity\\". It is not a faithful adaptation nor is it intended to be. The book was just a springboard for something a little different. Having read the book and loved it, I also really enjoyed this movie. They are both excellent. Each forges its own path and entertains in its own way.<br /><br />The plot is simple, or so it seems. A man is found in the ocean with two bullets in his back. He is rescued by a trawler of Italian fishermen. When he regains total consciousness, he has no idea who he is or what he was doing that caused him to be floating in the ocean in the condition in which he had been. He shortly discovers his name to be Jason Bourne, and  it appears that a great many people are trying to kill him, though for what purpose he has no idea.<br /><br />Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) also discovers that he has some unusual gifts and  automatic, instinctive responses in certain situations. It turns out that he is a natural \\"Bourne\\" killer (pun intended). Jason teams up with a German expatriate named Maria (Franka Potente), and together they run into some heavy duty action, as they run for their lives. Meanwhile, a team of CIA trained assassins, dispatched by Bourne's boss, a CIA honcho named Conklin (Chris Cooper), are hot on the plucky couple's trail. There are a number of stunts and action scenes that are guaranteed to make one's palms start to sweat.<br /><br />Matt Damon, looking very buff,  portrays Bourne as an intelligent,  resourceful  character with a core of goodness imbedded in his assassin's psyche. He is simply terrific. Franka Potente is good as the free spirited Maria, who is also resourceful and Jason's love interest in the film, though, quite frankly, very few sparks fly between them.  Chris Cooper is excellent as Bourne's boss, Conklin. He is coldly efficient and brutal in his mop-up operation. Unlike Bourne, he lacks that core of goodness.<br /><br />This is an action packed, inventive, spy thriller that will hold the viewer in its thrall. This film revives that genre of film that was beginning to get a little stale.  Kudos to Damon for giving the viewer something fresh and entertaining in this genre.  This is a film that is well worth having in one's personal collection.ive, spy thriller that will hold the viewer in its thrall.

B00007149X|5.0|Two of the funniest US films from the 80's or early 90s.<br />STRIPES is a spirited, almost anarchic comedic romp through army life. Of course, the plot development half way through becomes improbable, but it links well with the original premise.<br />GROUNDHOG DAY is a sublime piece. The subtle changes in plot to work in the circular time reference are precisely done. Murray displays a delicate performance, with the right amount of comedic timing, with the necessary seriousness to keep the plot ticking along.<br />Murray has undertaken a number of films, but these two, particularly presented in a package, reveal Bill Murray at his best.
B000002BMV|5.0|I was born in 1974 and grew up as a child of the 1980's. Journey is part of the 1970's and 1980's, like MTV and VH1. I couldn't get enough of Pop, New Wave, and ROCK.<br />I had to sneak in my viewing of MTV and VH1 because my father forbid \\"that noise.\\"<br />My older cousin introduced me to Journey, through her initiative to listen to the \\"forbidden\\" stations in his absence.<br />Journey remains a favorite even after so many years. My pleasant memories of their music still remain associated with her introduction of that amazing guitar, drums, keyboarding, bass, and that VOICE!!<br />As an adult, I've expanded my knowlege of their songs that I didn't hear on the radio. The driving beat of Escape and Lay It Down aren't lullabies! It's great fun catching up on a lot of what I've missed.<br />Don't Stop Believin', Who's Crying Now, Open Arms, Separate Ways, Faithfully, and Send Her My Love are some of my favorites of the ballads. The joys and trials of growing up in the '80's come back when I hear these songs.<br />I have a lot of respect for Journey as a highly talented group of musicians. The music business is a very hard business to make it in, and they've made it through the storm, despite the critics.  Like any other industry, music is packaged and sold by businesses, so what's the deal with the \\"commericial rock\\" label?<br />Journey did so well because of their MUSIC!!! People like their songs, and they WORKED hard to be successful, honing their skills as musicians.<br />Don't ignore the early Journey albums, or the new CDs. Give it a try. It's ALL JOURNEY!!! They can still rock even after all these years!!
071484232X|5.0|This has to be the best book yet on the works of Waterhouse.  Its got historic facts and stories about his young life to a successful artist in Britain.  The author goes in depth about concepts and theories of how Waterhouse think in terms of painting and storytelling.  It also talks about the other Pre-Raphealists that lived at the same time as Waterhouse; their influence and relationship to him.  What I love about the most is the high quality of the prints.  The book is big in scale and the prints are marvelous in fullfilling the space.  <BR>If you like Waterhouse or Pre-Rapheal artworks this is one book that you won't want to miss.

B000002J1I|3.0|It comes as a surprise to me that despite this album's reputation, I've listened to this one more than I ever listened to 1977's 'Going For The One'. <br />It's not that Tormato is an infinitely better album or more accessible than Going For The One. I find that Tormato has songs I really like, songs I desperately try to like, and songs that just leave me baffled as to the direction some were going.<br />SONGS I REALLY LIKE:<BR>Release,Release to me is a precursor to DRAMA (1980). I hear in this track the direction Howe/Squire/White wanted to go with YES for the 80's. It has been said that the head of Atlantic heard this song from the demos, and thought that if every song followed suit, a great YES album for the new decade approaching was on its way. Unfortunately, Tormato is not Release, Release. You can definitely hear throughout the album that there are two different directions being pursued, one by Howe/Squire/White and one by Anderson/Wakeman. That they united at all is the mystery.<br />'On The Silent Wings of Freedom' is the other song I really enjoy, strong emphasis both on rhythm and unity in the Howe/Squire/White trio. I hear Drama being born on this album, and some of the members realising that the 80's were coming, and others resisting change and forcing a direction that seems has left many fans high and dry in dissatisfaction or puzzlement as to why???<br />'Onward' rests outside these two songs as my other favourite. The reviewer who has stated it may be better suited for Squire's solo album, I have to agree. It does more suit 'Fish Out of Water' than on here, but its still a beautiful song nevertheless, and one of the best things Squire has written, ever. <br />SONGS I DESPERATELY TRY TO LIKE:<BR>Future Times/Rejoice , Don't Kill The Whale, and Madrigal. Each song has its strong points, but its on these songs I hear that struggle between two different factions (Howe/Squire/White vs. Anderson/Wakeman) most clearly, and where definitely someone's tryingto win. They all have their moments, and though Madrigal is mainly Anderson/Wakeman, it seems a continuation of 'Turn of the Century' from Going For The One, a direction Anderson & Wakeman were definitely heading. After YES were 'classical' in a Beethoven/Stravinsky/Mozart way, it seems natural to explore Baroque music in the YES context, but I think it was too late in YES's career to go Baroque. Back in the Fragile days would have been better suited. The problem is, Anderson & Wakeman were of like mind, but 4 years too late. With Wakeman's departure in 1973, Anderson & Wakeman were as far apart as can be. 4 years later they agreed on the direction, but continuing a course started in 1973 by 1977/1978 seems better suited for a solo project and not in a group situation. <br />SONGS THAT JUST LEAVE ME BAFFLED:<BR>Though I think the message of 'Circus of Heaven' I appreciate, that despite all of these wonderful creations mankind produces, the most beautiful seem to be those nature provides (if thats the message at all!!!!) this song seems all wrong for Yes to be doing. I like the fact that a slight reggae feel is incorporated into Yes music, but in 1978 EVERYONE discovered reggae! Well, except for Marley, Tosh, Cliff and all the originators of the genre. 'Arriving U.F.O.' suffers the same fate unfortunately.<br />I have no clue what Anderson & Wakeman wanted Yes to be at this point. It started on Going For The One, and ended disastrously on Tormato. Whether Baroque, or Reggae, or New Wave, whatever they saw, it was in no way prepared for the 80's, and had Howe, Squire & White allowed Anderson & Wakeman to pursue this direction unchallenged, you'd just be hearing about a YES Reunion tour being put together. Yes would have been finished in 1978 or a year later. Whenever I hear the Anderson/Wakeman/Howe/Squire/White grouping ,I always hear a tug and pull going on in the direction of the music. Someone always steps back, someone always stands upfront, its never in the middle or compromise never pursued. I think every album these 5 people worked on suffers in a way because of it. You also notice that the 4 major works they co-operated on (Tales From Topographic Oceans / Going For The One / Tormato / and 'Keystudio') seem to be the albums that cause the greatest disagreement between Yes members AND Yes fans. It has to tell you that something's not quite right with this 5 man line-up.<br />Buy Tormato for the 3 great songs on here, or the 2 really disliked ones. Its up to you of course. But know that Yes have done far far better than this, and usually one or two of the members that produced this album AREN'T involved.
B00004YKUY|5.0|A lot of bands have gone the way of the wind and never been heard from again. Journey is back and worth listening to, as always. Do pick up a copy of ARRIVAL and give it a try! <br />As to the complaints about the new lead singer, Steve Augeri, give the band a break! Steve Perry couldn't continue for health reasons!! I'm a fan of the ENTIRE group. A band is not comprised of just ONE talent doing all the work. Other band members have sung lead on other albums, so what's the big deal? <br />There's some really great new songs on here. Higher Places, All the Way, and Signs of Life are really infectious. I've Got a Reason, and much more, to listen! <br />The band members have grown up and had wives, kids, and normal lives. This gives them a different set of experiences and provides plenty of room for new material. I'm glad to see them back in the music business again.  <br />Give Red 13 a whirl for those who remember the older Journey albums, especially for the guitar!
B000000W6F|4.0|This album is amazing!!! By the time Mellon Collie came out the smashing pumpkins had established themselves as one of the great alt-rock bands of the 90's. It's amazing that a band can put out an album as masterful as Gish and to top it as the pumpkins did with Mellon Collie and the Infinate Sadness. I urge you to buy this album and support a near abolished creature, the Musician. This album has great creativity. There are amazing lyrics and uncontainable guitar riffs. Billy Corgan takes his guitar and brings it to life. Great work from a great band!
B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie is packed with action and has a great, new look on an old plot with tons of twists to always keep you guessing.  If you like action movies, see this movie.  If you like martial arts movies, see this movie.  If you like guns, SEE THIS MOVIE!!!<BR>You are gonna hear alot about how this movie is a Matrix rip-off, but it's not true at all.  Just because they use guns, martial arts, and wear all black automatically makes it a rip-off?  There is NO wire fighting and NO bullet-time which made the Matrix.  Sure the movie poster looked a little like the one the Matrix used, but big deal.  The only things that really links this movie to the Matrix are the trenchcoats and the awesome fight sequences (in my opinion, Equilibrium has faster paced action).
B000084T18|4.0|Wow! 50 cent has really burst onto the scene with his hits \\"Wanksta\\" and \\"In Da Club\\". It's a really good CD but most of the songs are about guns. He brags about being shot 9 times and all that, which he has every right to because if i have been shot 9 times, i probably woulda died. all the songs are good. they have really catchy beats and the lyrics are good. He does diss a few people but what do you expect? It doesnt mean you should automatically hate on him. Its just all for fun (with that Eminem touch). Lil' Kim got kinda mad about the whole nose thing in \\"Wanksta\\" but she forgave him when he said he was only playin. Dont hang on every word. Some of my favorite songs on this CD are:<BR>1.Patiently Waiting<BR>2. In Da Club<BR>3. P.I.M.P<BR>4. 21 Questions<BR>5. Don't Push Me<BR>6. Wanksta<BR>These arent in really any order. Overall the CD was worth my money and if he comes out with another CD, I'll probably buy it. Good work 50!
B000002J1I|3.0|It comes as a surprise to me that despite this album's reputation, I've listened to this one more than I ever listened to 1977's 'Going For The One'.<br />It's not that Tormato is an infinitely better album or more accessible than Going For The One. I find that Tormato has songs I really like, songs I desperately try to like, and songs that just leave me baffled as to the direction some were going.<br />SONGS I REALLY LIKE:<br />Release,Release to me is a precursor to DRAMA (1980). I hear in this track the direction Howe/Squire/White wanted to go with YES for the 80's. It has been said that the head of Atlantic heard this song from the demos, and thought that if every song followed suit, a great YES album for the new decade approaching was on its way. Unfortunately, Tormato is not Release, Release. You can definitely hear throughout the album that there are two different directions being pursued, one by Howe/Squire/White and one by Anderson/Wakeman. That they united at all is the mystery.<br />'On The Silent Wings of Freedom' is the other song I really enjoy, strong emphasis both on rhythm and unity in the Howe/Squire/White trio. I hear Drama being born on this album, and some of the members realising that the 80's were coming, and others resisting change and forcing a direction that seems has left many fans high and dry in dissatisfaction or puzzlement as to why???<br />'Onward' rests outside these two songs as my other favourite. The reviewer who has stated it may be better suited for Squire's solo album, I have to agree. It does more suit 'Fish Out of Water' than on here, but its still a beautiful song nevertheless, and one of the best things Squire has written, ever.<br />SONGS I DESPERATELY TRY TO LIKE:<br />Future Times/Rejoice , Don't Kill The Whale, and Madrigal. Each song has its strong points, but its on these songs I hear that struggle between two different factions (Howe/Squire/White vs. Anderson/Wakeman) most clearly, and where definitely someone's trying to win. They all have their moments, and though Madrigal is mainly Anderson/Wakeman, it seems a continuation of 'Turn of the Century' from Going For The One, a direction Anderson & Wakeman were definitely heading. After YES were 'classical' in a Beethoven/Stravinsky/Mozart way, it seems natural to explore Baroque music in the YES context, but I think it was too late in YES's career to go Baroque. Back in the Fragile days would have been better suited. The problem is, Anderson & Wakeman were of like mind, but 4 years too late. With Wakeman's departure in 1973, Anderson & Wakeman were as far apart as can be. 4 years later they agreed on the direction, but continuing a course started in 1973 by 1977/1978 seems better suited for a solo project and not in a group situation.<br />SONGS THAT JUST LEAVE ME BAFFLED:<br />Though I think the message of 'Circus of Heaven' I appreciate, that despite all of these wonderful creations mankind produces, the most beautiful seem to be those nature provides (if thats the message at all!!!!) this song seems all wrong for Yes to be doing. I like the fact that a slight reggae feel is incorporated into Yes music, but in 1978 EVERYONE discovered reggae! Well, except for Marley, Tosh, Cliff and all the originators of the genre. 'Arriving U.F.O.' suffers the same fate unfortunately.<br />I have no clue what Anderson & Wakeman wanted Yes to be at this point. It started on Going For The One, and ended disastrously on Tormato. Whether Baroque, or Reggae, or New Wave, whatever they saw, it was in no way prepared for the 80's, and had Howe, Squire & White allowed Anderson & Wakeman to pursue this direction unchallenged, you'd just be hearing about a YES Reunion tour being put together. Yes would have been finished in 1978 or a year later. Whenever I hear the Anderson/Wakeman/Howe/Squire/White grouping ,I always hear a tug and pull going on in the direction of the music. Someone always steps back, someone always stands upfront, its never in themiddle or compromise never pursued. I think every album these 5 people worked on suffers in a way because of it. You also notice that the 4 major works they co-operated on (Tales From Topographic Oceans / Going For The One / Tormato / and 'Keystudio') seem to be the albums that cause the greatest disagreement between Yes members AND Yes fans. It has to tell you that something's not quite right with this 5 man line-up.<br />Buy Tormato for the 3 great songs on here, or the 2 really disliked ones. Its up to you of course. But know that Yes have done far far better than this, and usually one or two of the members that produced this album AREN'T involved.dle or compromise never pursued.

B00005JLZ9|4.0|Basic is anything but that - it proves to be the very antithesis of its title with its bizarre and constantly twisting and changing storyline. I believe Newton once said: With every cause, there comes an equal or greater effect. Well, while watching this movie you're constantly refiguring the outcomes when the variables continue to change - so much so that it almost makes you dizzy! Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are dead on as Army Rangers - the supporting cast is superb as well. I was pleasantly surprised by the cleverness of the plot and the good acting.<br />If you mix Black Hawk Down with The Usual Suspects you come out with Basic. Worth a look-see for all military buffs - just be prepared to pay VERY close attention to detail. One of the best movies I've seen in a while. Enjoy.
6304401132|4.0|The Disney heroes/heroines never really did it for me. Maybe, its my slightly warped personality that makes me root for the villains. \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" boasts a humdinger of a bad girl in the guise of Malificent, maliciously voiced by the late character actress Eleanor Audley. She had the perfect pipes for the portrayal of one devoid of compassion and love.<br />The actress had previously made a distinctive contribution to an earlier Disney film, the classic \\"Cinderella\\" (she was the wicked stepmother). '60's audiences also remember her as Eddie Albert's mother on the comedy classic \\"Green Acres\\" and her frequent appearances on that other country-themed comedy \\"The Beverly Hillbillies\\".<br />Also, being a dragon fan, I love Malificent's final transformation as she takes on the valiant, handsome, and dashing (although, bland) prince.<br />Unfortunately, the good guy wins.
B000002ITW|5.0|I bought this lp on vinyl when it came out.  At that time I didn't much care for it because it was 'only' the live versions of songs I loved, and when I was young I looked for perfection -- the studio versions.  Now at my advanced age 30 years later I find 4-Way Street much more appealing than the studio albums -- I have an enormous amount of affection for this music with all its flaws -- missed notes, garbled words, muffed chords.  It's just these four guys with their bassman Calvin &quot;Fuzzy&quot; Samuels and their drummer Johnny Barbata.  You can feel their humor and their passion, and it's so much more immediate and accessible than the sterile (but awesome) studio stuff.  My gods came down into human form!<BR>I was thrilled and amazed when I updated to the cd because there are four more songs on it than on the original double album, one from each man -- Nash's &quot;King Midas in Reverse&quot;,  Crosby's &quot;Laughing&quot; (one of my Top Ten All-Time Favorite songs), Stills' &quot;Black Queen&quot; and Young's &quot;Loner/Cinnamon Girl/Down by the River&quot; medley.<BR>Live albums also give me a chance, as a sometime guitar-player, to guess chords and tunings by ear.  This cd sits right next to Crosby &amp; Nash's &quot;Another Stoney Evening&quot; -- another wonderful and highly underrated live outing.<BR>Bravo!  Thank God someone in the 1970's had the sense to capture this irreplaceable beauty on tape, wish they had video back then......
B00008J4P5|5.0|The White Stripes's \\"Elephant\\" is such a remarkable improvement from the previous album, \\"White Blood Cells,\\" that it is difficult to believe that they were recorded by the same band.  Not that \\"Cells\\" was bad, but in retropect that album merely hinted at this duo's potential.  No other rock artist today can approach their ability to effectively combine elements of early 1970s classic rock and late 1970s punk.  \\"Ball and Biscuit,\\" for example, is the best seven minute-plus, heavy blues, innuendo-laden rock song released since \\"Physical Graffiti.\\"  And if leader Jack White's voice is no match for Robert Plant's, his guitar playing does give Jimmy Page a run for his money.<br />More importantly, The Stripes know how to mix up styles and how to alternate harder and softer tracks without it sounding forced.  The songs range from the danceable \\"Seven Nation Army,\\" to the accoustic \\"In the Cold, Cold Night\\" with Meg White on lead vocals, to the punkish \\"Girl, You Have No Faith in Medicine.\\"  But perhaps the most unique song in the mix is the threesome vocal tradeoffs and clever wordplay of \\"Well It's True That We Love One Another,\\" featuring Jack, Meg and guest vocalist Holly Golightly.<br />The production album is fantastic, and is made even more remarkable by the fact that they used an 8 track reel to reel recorder and only very basic instruments to record it.  This rather docternaire approach would be severely limiting in the hands of less talented musicians and ultimately would not matter if the songs on the album were not first rate, which they most certainly are.<br />Overall, \\"Elephant\\" is an amazing triumph from one of the most refreshing unique rock and roll bands around.
0871137380|5.0|While others have written books recounting battles and wars, Mark Bowden has penned, in Black Hawk Down, an incredibly real, almost surreal, account of war that enthralls and invigorates like no other.  When reading the book, you not only feel like you're there in the bustling and chaotic Bakara Market in impoverished Mogadishu, you also feel like you are a veritable member of Task Force Ranger.  Bowden takes you, the reader, to the site of this tumultuous bloodshed vicariously through his exquisite and no-holds-barred account of modern warfare.<br />So much better than the movie, the book fully engrosses you and makes you root for the Rangers and Delta Force members, as they find themselves in for a real barn burner in hostile territory, overwhelmingly outnumbered by thousands of hostile drugged-out AK-47 toting clansmen.  Despite only losing 18 valiant men to hundreds, if not thousands(depends who you ask) of Sammys, many seem to chalk The Battle of Mogadishu up as a destitute failure.  Although it would have been a resounding success, if not for the inaction and incompetence of Secretary of Defense Les Aspin and President Clinton, Task Force Ranger nonetheless achieved their objectives of extracting two high-ranking clan leaders.  The procurement of AC-130 Gunships, Abrams Tanks, and Bradley Fighting Vehicles, as requested by General Montgomery - and subsequently denied by Aspin, would have assured a more pragmatic, and in turn, more successful battle plan.  This book is a tribute to the brave men and women, like Randy Shughart and Gary Gordon, who fight, and oftentimes die, so that we may be free.
0142000663|5.0|What amazes me about this book is the writing. Steinbeck was a wizard of desription and characterization.  His book challenges you to see the world with new eyes- the unfairness of things as well as the beauty of small gestures.  I am shocked by some of the negative Amazon reviews.  It appears that some of those writing have no concept about the ideas presented in this novel or are in denial about American history.  But getting back to this book: read it slowly, linger over Tom and Ma and Rose of Sharon and their sorrows, their daily sacrifices. There is nothing boring here but you will be challenged as to your religious and political stances.  The Joads are America itself.  Powerful stuff.

B00005JLWL|5.0|When I went to go see this movie with friends, I had no clue as to what it was about. Someone said, \\"It's like the Matrix, but not.\\" That perked my interest. So I went, but mostly just to hang with my friends.<br />Beautiful<br />Moving<br />I can think of no better words to use for this film.<br />It was a rather low-budget, but you wouldn't really notice it while you're watching it. They were able to make the movie in such a why as to NOT be expensive. Most of the sets are monochrome, yet sleek. So why does it work so well?<br />The basic plot of the movie is this: Humans are an emotional creature, strong emotions lead to hate, hate leads to war, thus emotion is the enemy of mankind.<br />Ruled by a \\"benevolent\\" dictator, the city pumps itself full of a drug that suppresses emotion. A special type of law-enforcers, called \\"Clerics\\", police the citizens for items with \\"Emotional Content\\". Objects like artwork, books of poetry, perfume, things with color and decoration.<br />The overall plot is pretty predictable, but that doesn't lessen the movie in any way. The most moving scene is when you watch the Star, Christian Bale, begin to \\"feel\\" for the first time. I sat in my seat and cried. And the action sequences were something to drool over. This is probably the first movie that I've watched that satisfied both my Action/Fighting craving along with my desire for good Drama.<br />If you haven't seen it, GO SEE IT! It's worth the drive, it's worth the rental, it's worth BUYING! You WILL NOT regret it.
B000065U1N|5.0|Let's be frank here - if you've read the book(like me), the movie pales in comparison.  That being said, the movie, without comparison to the book, is a solid, if not spectacular, piece of filmmaking.  The hostile anarchy of Bakara Market is masterfully recreated by Ridley Scott.  The cast, from watching the special feature segment on the DVD, actually went through real Ranger and Delta training.  That makes for a surprisingly realistic and well-made war movie - not some Hollywood glitzy anti-war ....<br />The cast, as stated in interviews, felt it their duty to accurately represent the members of Task Force Ranger and Delta Force as well as to honor those who so valiantly gave their lives in Mogadishu.  Black Hawk Down tells the story of normal people put in conditions that are anything but normal.  They didn't plan on being heroes - but that's exactly what they became - none moreso than Medal of Honor winners Gary Gordon and Randy Shughart, who selflessly gave their lives for their fellow man and their country.  It is immeasurably powerful - because it really happened.  A great movie to own.

0446608955|4.0|A Walk to Remember is one of my favorite books.  I don't usually like to read but I couldn't put this book down.  An easy read, it never got boring.  I also saw the movie but without a doubt the book was way better having more detail and depth.<br />A Walk to Remember is  about two teenagers, Landon Carter and Jamie Sullivan.  Now, Landon was your regular teenager but Jamie was not- she was a minister's daughter and liked to read the Bible and volunteer at an orphanage.  She was also something of an outcast.  Landon had to go to the school's homecoming dance but there was only one problem:  he needed a date.  He knew everyone had a date but Jamie and him, so he decided to ask her to the dance.  They went to the dance and had a fairly good time and, as a result, they became friends.  Landon began to feel something for her besides friendship and they fell in love with each other.  Jamie had a secret though and that secret was that she was dying.  When Landon finds out, he tries to make all of her dreams come true before she dies.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who likes love stories.  It has a trajic ending but, at the same time, a good ending.
B00005JLXC|4.0|What that means is that this movie was better than I expected it to be.

Subway chase <BR>3.) Playground fight scene.  <BR> Anyways, most people didn't like it, but it turned out to be a pretty good movie.

B000002I53|5.0|This, as many have observed, was an important and richly fertile  record in  Coltrane's career, with impressive new personnel, and the introduction of his soprano sax, as well as offering much other great musical innovation. The \\"rhythm\\" section subsequently came to be identified with him, and was a great asset to his music. So was the use of the soprano sax, which is used to great  advantage here. \\"My Favorite Things\\" is one of those interesting themes Coltrane used to employ totally to his own, and highly original, advantage: he turns it inside out, rings the changes on it, and soars exploringly and mesmerisingly all the way.  \\"But not for me\\" shows a similarly original but very different handling of a well known \\"song\\".  This is, quite simply, one of the best and most \\"classical\\" of Coltrane's recordings. It is not necessarily the easiest one to access, and requires intense concentration, but deserves every bit of attention one gives it.  - Joost Daalder
0684803356|4.0|For Whom the Bell Tolls, written by the well respected and one of the greatest authors of all times, Earnest Hemingway, is based on Hemingway's experience in the Spanish Civil War during 1937, when he went to cover it for the North American Newspaper Alliance. He has written many other spectacularly historic books like The Sun Also Rises, Farewell to Arms, and numerous other accounts of his real adventures covering other major historic events in American history. Hemingway's characteristic laconic, terse and fluid prose and dialogue shine radiantly throughout this book giving off his unique style of writing. There are layers and layers of emotion, passion, and personal pain. You are transported to the mountains of Spain with Jordan and a band of Spanish guerilla fighters. His description of the characters is so incredibly real, that the reader feels as though you could find their names in a history book.<BR>For Whom the Bell Tolls begins and ends in a pine-scented forest, somewhere in Spain all in sixty-eight hour period, in which he meets up with the guerilla group, falls in love with a Spanish girl named Maria, and blows up a key bridge behind enemy lines. The year is 1937 and the Spanish Civil War is in full swing. Robert Jordan, a demolition expert attached to the International Brigades lies \\"flat on the brown, pine-needled floor of the forest, his chin on his folded arms, and high overhead the wind blew in the tops of the pine trees.\\" (1) The sylvan setting, however, is at sharp odds with the reason Jordan is there: he has come to blow up a bridge on behalf of the antifascist guerrilla forces. He hopes he'll be able to rely on their local leader, Pablo, to help carry out the mission, but upon meeting him, Jordan has his doubts: \\"I don't like that sadness, he thought. That sadness is bad. That's the sadness they get before they quit or before they betray. That is the sadness that comes before the sell-out.\\" (85) For Pablo, it seems, has had enough of the war. Hehas amassed for himself a small herd of horses and wants only to stay quietly in the hills and attract as little attention as possible. Jordan's arrival--and his mission--have seriously alarmed him. Hemingway touches on, among other things, love, loyalty, sacrifice for the greater good, rape, suicide, altruism, and social injustice.  <BR>For Whom the Bell Tolls is an excellent book, which breaks down the tragedies of war and the emotional struggles that come along with it. Hemingway is definitely the best author of his era, with a different approach to a story idea. The reading makes it hard to go through the book, but the story line keeps the reader connected with the book. I enjoyed Hemingway's unique style and hope to read more of his books with pleasure.
0385504209|5.0|My first experience with Dan Brown was with Angels and Demons (another brillant novel).  The Da Vinci Code is superb.  Dan Brown has a consistent ability to integrate factual information in a fictious plot...something that I have never seen in an author.

B000003489|5.0|This is certainly an excellent \\"buy\\", as it is a great Coltrane recording,  the quality of the sound recorded is excellent, there is an abundance of music, and the  notes are good, though you may need a magnifying glass to read them, especially if you are not young. The price is eminently attractive.<br />This recording features for one thing the tracks on the original LP, ALL of which are of a superb standard. To my mind Coltrane is usually more impressive when the going is fast, as is the case in six out of the seven LP tracks, with only \\"Naima\\" as a notable (and rewarding) exception. The \\"extra\\" (\\"bonus\\") tracks are all worth having, though it is a matter of opinion whether they are, as variations on the tracks originally chosen for the LP, really a major addition.<br />Coltrane's inventiveness is a delight throughout, and, even when breath-takingly fast, he has his many, many notes well under control, phrasing intelligently, logically, and meaningfully. There is none of the wildness or extravagance that at times marred his later playing: this is disciplined music, of awesome technical assurance, but profound and original at the same time. It confirms Coltrane's status as one of the most important tenor-sax players ever, and certainly of his period, which was one of the most fertile and greatest in jazz.<br />The \\"rhythm\\" players had to meet quite a challenge, but did very well indeed. Nevertheless, good though their support was, this is pretty much Coltrane's record, and well worth having in addition to such other great Coltrane CDs as \\"A Love Supreme\\", \\"Africa Brass', \\"My Favorite Things\\", and some others. It just possibly is not quite as \\"great\\" as any of those - but it is extremely satisfying to listen to, and in any case consistently offers music of a quite extraordinarily high standard.

0553208845|2.0|This book is no doubt well written and a quick, easy read. However, I found it to be very hokey. If you are very spiritual and you like the Celestine Prophecy, then you'll probably love this book. If you are practical and down to earth, I don't recommend it. Many reviewers say that this book changed their life. I don't get it. Maybe I skipped a chapter....
B000060OFT|1.0|I saw this movie when it first came out in the theatre, and I was so appalled with the film that I almost walked out. At the time, I believed that updating Shakespeare was not to be done. However, I have grown up since being a freshman in high school, gone through college, performed Shakespeare, studied many other texts, and almost have my bachelors in English with an emphasis on British Literature. I went back to this film, hoping somehow I could shed some light on why everyone thought this was an amazing film. From all the studying I have done, I have come to appreciate some of the artistic choices Luhrmann has made in the film. However, that does not forgive the horrendous acting of every single performer in the movie. They speed right through their lines as if they want to fight the fact that is is written mostly in verse, instead of using it to drive the lines. To truly see how Shakespeare is done, watch the Zeffirelli version. There lies true Shakespearean acting. My goal is to teach high school students this beautiful play (one of Shakespeare's best tragedies, along with Othello), and I promise this version will never be something they lay eyes on.
B00005JLK1|1.0|'Ghost Ship' is lacking of a good story and good actors. First of all the story is very lame, and doesn't correllate with any of the other mysterious happenings. For example the fact that the Ocean Liner shows up in the Bering Strait holds no signifigance whatsoever. Second of all, the cast really drags. It's made up of unknowns, who seem to be complete amateurs. All the parts that were supposed to scare me actually made me either mad or laugh, because it is a disgrace to any cinematographer. Ultimately, Ghost ship actually deserves -1 star but i can't do that. Don't even bother.

B000066NW0|5.0|The CD is quite masterful and when you look at the magnitude of a 17 year old making this good of a CD in her first try, it's quite something. Although the genre of the music may be in question, it can take nothing away from this. Her voice is amazing compared to the other artists we see today including some of the big artists as well. Personally, I feel it is even better than Norah Jones and it showed with her achievements in a non biased award ceremony, the Juno Awards (Canada's equivalent of the Grammy's). Many are quick to complain, yet have no reason to. It's all too easy to criticize this music and give it 1 star and 0.0012 stars when you don't realize what work both the artist and the producer have put into the album and how it compares to other female vocalists. It is quite an album that is worth buying and not worth giving 1 or 0.0012 stars. I personally had no regrets purchasing this CD and I doubt you will either. In no way is it near Britney Spears as I have read in other reviews. She is 'Anti Britney Spears.' She actually wears clothes. The CD was also nominated for 5 Grammy Awards. This is something Korn has yet to do with multiple albums and Avril does in her first at the age of 17. You really can't compare the two seeing how one completely shadows out the other. The music is both melodic and filled with the churning riffs. The lyrics are great as well and were co-developed by the artist, something we're not seeing much these days. Buy it. You'll love it.
0385474547|3.0|This book really is good to read if you want to know about Nigerian culture in the 1800's.  I learned a lot from this book.  However, I didn't really enjoy reading though.  It was hard to like the book, when I really didn't like the main character, Okonkwo.  Okonkwo was really hateful, but I sort of understood where he was coming from.  He was really tough on everyone because he didn't want to be seen as weak, like his father, unoka, was.  It's an ok book, but not great.
B000060OFT|3.0|This movie was shown to us in Language Arts to help us &quot;understand&quot; the play better. But it is really one of the cheesiest movies I've ever seen. Not that it's not worth seeing; it's actually quite interesting to see Luhrman's interpretation of Romeo and Juliet (modernized with gun fights, explosions, hip hop, and lots of angry people screaming and driving around cars while shooting at each other) (And did I mention that the Prince is now as far down the echelon as Chief of Police?).<br />The movie has its moments, but for a movie, it is pretty unevenly paced. Shakespeare intended it to be a play, not a movie! In some parts it goes way too slow, while in others it goes way, WAY too fast. And at the beginning the Montague servants are literally screaming their lines, which gets to be like fingernails on a chalkboard after you've been listening to them for several minutes.<br />Oh yeah, and the Shakespearean language does not fit at all, especially when Romeo and Benvolio are having the conversation at the pool table. Can you imagine to guys walking into an arcade where you are hanging out and talking up a storm of &quot;thous&quot; and &quot;thys&quot; and &quot;thees&quot; while playing pool? Frankly, they looked like performance artists (reenacting a Shakespearean conversation between Romeo and Benvolio while playing pool at a modern arcade... I should try that some day!).<br />It's not bad, it's just not good. Mediocre. Lukewarm. Like I said before: if you haven't seen it, I encourage you to rent it if you're interested. But it's not worth the price of the purchase.
0553208845|5.0|Herman Hesse is a great author.  This is one of his best books.  It's about a teenager, Siddhartha, who has everything he needs but he still doesn't feel fulfilled.  So he goes on a journey to de-tach himself from everything in order to reach Nirvana (ultimate peace).  However, he meets a lovely courtesan, Kamala, who teaches him the ways of love.  Also, he starts gambling and becomes a reach man, unlike the man he wanted to be, a simple-living man.  He goes through many things to reach Nirvana in the end.  if you have not read this book, you should go pick it up now.
B0000714BP|5.0|The DVD has around 15 deleted scenes, albeit poor quality ones.  Way back this was a great feel-good movie for me, so when the DVD came out I bought it quickly.
B00005LB9O|5.0|One thing you must get through your head is that Travis is not Radiohead and they should not be compared to Radiohead (even though Fran Healey sounds a little bit like Thom Yorke circa Pablo Honey on some songs from Travis' debut album).<br />Ok, now you are ready to enjoy an album full of catchy mellow songs from a UK quartet and now they have a BANJO!! A great album and one that grew on me very quickly. Travis have been progressing their sound with each album and this is audible proof. Get this album.
B00004RFCM|4.0|I loved learning about the characters watching this season, but I didn't see the spark everyone seemd to be talking about until season two.  This is a good purchase for fans of the series, but don't buy this one first if you're looking for that catchy writing and directing you have been hearing about from others.
0380820846|5.0|Penelope Featherington has loved Colin Bridgerton (3rd of the Bridgerton clan) since she was 16. He never paid much attention to her and she knew that she could never have a man like him. She wasnt beautiful by society's standards and she was just a tad chubby when she was introduced to society in order to gain a husband. Unfurtunately, no one looked her way and Colin only danced with her in those balls out of pitty, and because his mother order him to (and you dont mess with Lady Bridgerton). 10 years later Penelope is 28 and used to the idea that she's a spinster and she will remain so. Colin has barely seen her in those 10 years since he spends too much time traveling, but when he returns he sees a different Penelope, because she is slowly starting to speak her mind instead of being so quiet as she used to. There's much more to the story. The plot is so entertaining I skipped a study session for a final so i could keep reading the book. I simply loved everything, the characters are well written, the plot is great, the dialogue is fantastic as well as funny and tender. In short this is my favorite JQ book! Highly recomend it! Plus there's a very interesting surprise as well! and Lady Whistledown is more superb than usual!

B00005JLRR|4.0|...is that they have to sell. Yes, that's right. While for the TV shows the producers have the liberty to play with really wonderful SF ideas (like the episode where Dr. Crusher gets trapped inside her own universe, or like \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" and there are so many more) and truly explore new worlds -- in terms of imagination at least, when they make the movies for the big screen, they have to compromise in order to satisfy the tastes of a broader audience, and that's how you get fist fights, Picard with a gun, chases through places with pipes etc, Data singing... True, all these are elements that were seen occasionally even in the TV series, but not all together at once, in an obvious attempt to make the movie SF, action-movie, occasionally funny all at once. Oh yes, and the ugly aliens. Why do they always have to be so repulsive??? The Romulans were always OK (our luck that we already knew them from TV and they couldn't change them), but the Remans just had to be as ugly as they can get. It's not believable, either... just think that the viceroy had nails so long that he couldn't press the buttons right. For me, these elements ruined the movie in parts. Also, some inconsistencies: what was Wesley doing at the wedding in a Starfleet uniform when we know clearly that he has left Starfleet years before with the Traveller?<br />Well, all these being said, you may wonder why it gets 4 stars. First of all, it's still Star Trek -- and definitely better than Insurrection. Then, if you leave aside the above, the movie does have its good parts. The Shinzon/Picard conflict is good -- even if it deals with cloning, but then, doesn't everything these days? -- and I loved the space battle. Thumbs up for ST on this one -- I was so dissapointed in SW II, where they had so much money but not a single space battle was shot... Also, the emotional development is good... except that I didn't quite sympathize with B4, he was never sufficiently developed. <br />And there was an aspect which reminded me of ST VI: there, in the end, they make peace with the Klingonians... here, in the end, they make peace with the Romulans. Feels like a nice closure. And a new beggining.
6301640659|3.0|Ultimately, this film generated far more controversy than it deserved. Let's face it, there are a lot of people, gay men included, into the S&M/leather subculture. In NYC in this era there were clubs like the Mineshaft and the Anvil where all kinds of public and kinky sex were the rule.  All the protests really amounted to was a group leather queens and politicos with their panties in a bunch about misrepresentation and stereotypes and homphobia and violence against gay men and .... okay, got the point.<br />Actually, it's a gritty, strange, well-acted mystery. Not a great film, but an intersting slice-of-life, period thriller. Was Friedkin being homophobic?  I don't really think so.  He just wanted to push some buttons and he did.
B000089A06|4.0|Thank God they made this movie.  After the horridness of Hannibal, they needed something to bring the Silence of the Lambs trilogy to the level it should be.  This movie does a great job of doing just that.<br />An amazing cast helps the movie along.  Ed Norton is spectacular as FBI agent Will Graham, trying to track down the Tooth Fairy serial killer, played amazingly by a creepy Ralph Fiennes.  This movie brings back the much-appreciated puzzle of chasing a serial killer where the agents actually have to think about things, and there's a surprise around ever corner.<br />Anthony Hopkins is once again masterful as Hannibal Lecter, after a disappointing showing in Hannibal.  He is intelligent, manipulative, and witty as ever, as opposed to Hannibal, where is is a little too omniscient, and seemingly only there to get a maximum gross-out factor from his cannibalism.<br />Either way, this movie is definitely the second-best movie in the trilogy, behind, of course, the original.  It is definitely light years ahead of Hannibal in just about every category, and highly recommended.
B000066NW0|5.0|Ever since I first heard Avril Lavigne's first hit, Complicated, on the radio, I found out what great music truely is! By the time my best friends had gotten Let Go, and had listened to it and recommended it, I had to get it myself. So last Christmas, of course, I needed to get Let Go! I did get it, and it is practically all I listen to, because I love it so much! All of the songs on it are worth listening to. Personally, to those of you who say she's a poser, I really don't care! It's her music that I like-her style just adds to her personality!
B000089A07|5.0|We all know by now that there was a book before The Silence of the Lambs, by the name of Red Dragon. Few are aware that there was a movie based on this novel by the name of 'Manhunter', though it was a fair adaptation, this is far superior.<BR>    This is a few years before Hannibal Lecter has even heard the name Clarice Starling,at this time his opponent in the mind games is an ex-FBI agent by the name of Will Graham. Will is a much more interesting opponent for Lecter, seeing as he is the man responsible for Lecter's incarceration.<BR>    Graham is called out of retirement by his boss Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel)in order to assist in the investigation of two homicide cases, both of which share enough things for the FBI to become convinced that they are hunting for a serial killer.<BR>    Crawford wants Graham because of Graham's ability to get inside the head of a serial killer, so much that he virtually becomes one of them. Crawford is also aware that if worse comes to worse they may have to consult Hannibal Lecter, who, in spite of his status as a convicted felon, is still one of the best forensic psychiatrists in the country. And the only person Lecter will talk to is Graham. <BR>    Graham reluctantly comes onboard to assist, in the hope that the killer will get caught before he has a chance to strike again, and then he can go home for good. But there is no denying the ability he has to think and act so much like a serial killer, as Lecter so thoughtfully tells him during their first exchange &quot;You caught me because we are just alike&quot;. And it's clear from this first reunion that Lecter's obsession with Graham is far from over.<BR>    However, Lecter sets aside his obsession long enough to give Graham the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle to help him catch the killer the tabloid press have dubbed 'The Tooth Fairy'. Lecter is disdainful of Graham's claim that he's at a loss with these murders, and he takes every chance to taunt Graham about the state of his own mind.<BR>    Anthony Hopkins once again showed the world why Hannibal Lecter was voted as the number one villain in film of all time, Edward Norton proved a good foil for Hopkins' Lecter. Ralph Fiennes was excellent as Francis Dolarhyde, a lonely photo lab manager whose mind and actions are influenced (and to what extent, controlled) by a Blake painting named Red Dragon. Brett Ratner, best known for the 'Rush Hour' films, proved all of his critics wrong by crafting a film which closely rivals it's decade old sequel.<BR>    This DVD is definitely worth the extra money for all the features, such as deleted scenes and seeing one of Brett Ratner's first films. But the dossier on Hannibal Lecter seemed a little silly to me, but whatever turns you on.
B00005JK8K|3.0|The Marine Joe Enders (Nicolas Cage) is the sole survivor of previous combat where his whole platoon was massacred after which he had to take command upon the death of the platoon leader.  At a military hospital he regains his strength, but he suffers from permanent hearing loss and a damaged balance system.  However, a caring nurse helps him cheat on a hearing test, which enables him to regain his combative status.  His survival in combat is observed as useful by the Marine Crops and they assign him on a mission to protect the Navajo solider, Ben Yahzee, whose objective is to send code in his own language.  This code is an unsolved enigma for the Japanese forces, however, they are attempting to capture and torture anyone who knows the code in order to help themselves.  Thus, it is essential that Joe protects the code at all costs as they invade the island of Saipan.  Windtalkers is a fascinating story and the moral dilemma which Joe faces is equally interesting.  However, the score in the film is played all too frequently and it generates a cheesy atmosphere that seems contradictory to the dilemma.  In addition, there is some awkwardness in the combative scenes that resembles Achilles' godlike presence, which seems far fetched and similar to the shooting scenes in John Woo's earlier films.  The enemy also seems to be far too stupid, in comparison to what they really were, which diminish the feeling of realism.  Lastly, Windtalkers provides an action packed cinematic experience, which fails in addressing the questions at hand and leaves the audience with an empty reaction.

B00005JLXC|3.0|The blind Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck), a lawyer by day and superhero by night, has sworn to protect those who cannot protect themselves.  His blindness was a result of an accident with toxic waste, but the accident also provided him with sonar radar similar to what bats use to detect food.  This sonar offers him the opportunity to sense things that normal human beings cannot sense and when he combines this with his fearless behavior he becomes the one some call the Daredevil.  One day when he has coffee with his legal partner he meets Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner) and they fall in love with one another.  However, someone is out to harm her family and when the Daredevil attempts to help something goes wrong.  Daredevil is a superhero film with a lot of action and well choreographed fights. Nonetheless, the story falls flat when it attempts to deliver moral messages and dilemmas, since it is not followed through with and finished.  At times the film provides a choppy experience when some events in the film seem incoherent, leaveing the audience with a time filler that provides an empty feeling.

B00006IUL7|4.0|The Los Angles detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and his partner are sent to Alaska to investigate a bizarre murder of a teenage girl.  During the murder investigation there is a simultaneous investigation of the two LA detectives in LA, which might incriminate detective Dormer and set free all the criminals that he has put behind bars.  When an opportunity to arrest the murderer of the teenage girl arises, the detectives set a trap for the murderer, but something goes wrong in the fog of things.  This leads to an overbearing sense of guilt for detective Dormer that induces insomnia, which affects logical reasoning and all other aspects of detective Dormer's investigation of the murder.  The constant daylight keeps the audience reminded with intelligent manner that one cannot escape guilt.  Insomnia is a remake of the Norwegian film with the same title where Stellan Skarsgård has the roll that Al Pacino performs in the remake.  The Norwegian version is different in the sense of solitude and culture while the remade version provides an clever and different view of the same film.  The film is cunningly directed as well as acted with a brilliant touch and it leaves the viewer with an experience that will not fade.

B00004Y87O|3.0|In a dark future where violence and crime is staggering, the government has shut down Manhattan and made it into a high security prison where prisoners have been put for life to govern themselves.  There are no ways out, since the government has mined all the bridges to and from the island and a wall has been erected on the shores around the island where guards are equipped with heavy firearms.  When cynical Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) is sent to the prison to serve his life sentence he is offered amnesty, if he can recover the President of the United States who has crashed into Manhattan.  In addition, he is forced to follow a certain time line and if he does not follow the time line a bomb will explode within his arteries.  Escape from New York is an action packed science fiction film that keeps the audience interested in the plot, however, the story suffers from incoherent characters and the technology that the can be seen in the film inhibits the audience from getting a good feeling for the story.

B00005JLZL|5.0|Shakespeare once stated, the fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool, and this quote narrows down the idea of the film in regards to the death penalty.  Dr. David Gale (Kevin Spacey) is on death row for the murder of his friend, Constance Hallaway (Laura Linney), with whom he once was an anti-death penalty activist.  Dr. Gale has requested to have three interviews with Newsweek magazine's reporter Elizabeth 'Bitsey' Bloom (Kate Winslet), each one sequentially in the days prior his execution.  The interviews are the premise on which the story is built and this is presented through flashbacks.  In between these three flashbacks there is clear evidence emerging in regards to Dr. Gale's innocence, but who is providing them with the proof?  Life of David Gale is a interesting film that plays with the attribution theory and the moral dilemma of death penalty.  Moreover, the story is driven by the audience, meaning that the audience must be aware and alert on what is being presented to them.  At the end, the film provides much food for the brain to ponder, which can be fuel for future discussions.
B00003CXWV|3.0|Beneath its cool, cool surface, blow is an old fashioned morality play about the importance of hard work and family. The right virtues are exemplified by Johnny Depp's father. While Depp achieves great success, it is all based on a lie and eventually his world comes crumbling down and he loses it all. Loosely based on an autobiography, the film never discards its moralistic edge. Indeed you begin to scream at the characters not to be so stupid. But drugs and big money can take their toll. You would think after the first ten million dollars most people would just stop, but the characters lurch onto their destruction.<br />I did feel some sympathy for the central character but then I realised that he helped make the Colombian cocaine kings rich and remembered the devastation that they caused in that country. I think he got off pretty lightly. At least his daughter is still alive.
0385504209|5.0|It has been quite some time since I cracked open a novel that was as compelling as 'The Da Vinci Code'.  This is my first novel by Dan Brown, but I assure you it will not be my last.  This story headlines one incredible world-class 'What If' scenario:  What if Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married and produced children?  What if there were a secret society charged with not only keeping this as quiet as possible, but also to protect that seed at all costs?  What if the clues to the very existence of the mythical Holy Grail were contained within some of the most famous art work of Leonardo Da Vinci?  What if all this WASN'T just the fertile imagination of Dan Brown, but rather a factual group of stories tied together with a fictional premise?  Get ready for the ride of your life as 'The Da Vinci Code' opens up the world of Cryptology and Symbology in easily one of THE MOST overall entertaining novels I have read in several years.<br />What is so truly amazing about this tale is the depth of research that Dan Brown so obviously put into all of this Grail Lore and how he convincingly ties it all together.  I sat with my mouth open on many occasions as I pondered his phenomenal imagination and how he managed to put it all in one book -- and making it so compelling that you keep promising yourself that you'll stop reading...AFTER the next chapter.<br />One of the curators of the famous Louvre Museum in Paris is suddenly targeted for elimination by shadow forces that aren't what they seem to be as the story unfolds.  He is shot and left for dead, but before his life ends, he quickly leaves several clues for Sophie Neveu (his granddaughter) and Symbologist, Robert Langdon to discover.  Before he realizes what has happened, Robert finds himself the chief target for this murder and Sophie mysteriously helps him to escape, hoping to fully decipher the riddles left behind by her Grandfather.  Maybe I'm just horrible at figuring out these clues, but to my feeble mind they all seemed stunningly clever how they played out and how it led them on an adventure only to discover that the original puzzles left behind were only the beginning of a much larger list of historical clues, all of them REAL clues that have been documented over the centuries, all which lead them on a quest that just might find them discovering the legendary Holy Grail -- but it turns out NOT to be what you might think, in fact it came as a total and amazing surprise to me.  Again, what found me so impressed with this story was how all of these seemingly unconnected clues are all REAL and verifiable, and Dan Brown has managed a way to include them seamlessly in his novel.<br />From Paris to the outskirts of London, this well-told tale moves along at a frenetic pace in what I would describe as one of the best stories I have ever found.  Dan Brown should be congratulated on piecing together such a highly complicated story, all while making it completely understandable and thoroughly entertaining at the same time.  I will be recommending 'The Da Vinci Code' for a very long time to come and anxiously look forward to discovering a few of Mr. Brown's previous novels...in short, BUY THIS BOOK.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!emed stunningly clever how they played out and how it led them on an adventure only to discover that the original puzzles left behind were only the beginning of a much larger list of historical clues, all of them REAL clues that have been documented over the centuries, all which lead them on a quest that just might find them discovering the legendary Holy Grail -- but it turns out NOT to be what you might think, in fact it came as a total and amazing surprise to me.

0930289234|5.0|Watchmen is a great graphic novel. The plot was so intricate and involving that it was like watching a movie. Additionally, there is a large amount of foreshadowing throughout the book that will be lost on you with the first reading; do yourself a favour and read it at least twice. The &quot;substory&quot; of the crazed sailor is itself pretty interesting as well.
0783225733|4.0|With no nifty packaging and no &quot;picture&quot; disks, this is the best bargain you will get for your money. Not one but two commentaries, an immensly entertaining documentary, a cache of other goodies and all on one disc. This has been a favorite in my library since a got it over a year ago. The movie is great and is one of Ron Howards best. Read the editorial review for the plot.<BR>When this came out, there were alot of other titles that came out with &quot;Collecter's Editions&quot; only to be reissued again a few years down the line with an &quot;improved&quot; version. It's nice to know that some studios got theirs right the first time. Don't be fooled by the unpretentious packaging of this DVD. Get this one.
B00008DDXC|3.0|I've never read any of the books but I thought the first movie was better. This dragged on a little at parts but was still fun. One thing I didnt understand was how did all the Weasleys and Harry and all the luggage fit into their little car. Looking forward to the other movies.
B00008972S|4.0|When I first saw this movie on VHS pan and scan. I smiled and shrugged my shouders and passed the movie off as nice but outdated. Entertaining but not really seeing what the big deal was. With this new offering of the DVD I get it. The sound and music explode on the screen. And I realize the only way to see this reworking of Romeo and Juliet is in widescreen. I'm not much of a fan of dance numbers, not much of a fan of the entire genre itself, but there were at least a dozen times where I said &quot;Wow!&quot; watching this one. This is also where most of the films strength comes from. They are having a great time on screen and it's infectious!<BR>With respect to Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer I found myself tuning out after the first of many songs where they declare there love for one another. Richard Beymer even says himself in the documentary on the second disc that the character is one dimensional until the climax at the end. <BR>Speaking of the second disc, the documentary is the only thing worth seeing here. It's quite good but uneven. Great stories from Beymer, Tamblyn and Moreno but where the heck is Chakiris? They talk very highly of him but he's nowhere around. They also have sound bites from past interviews of deceased cast and crew but no Natalie Wood. The love/hate stories about perfectionist Jerome Robbins are entertaining and informative. You have a deeper respect for the dancers. Particularly after &quot;Play it Cool.&quot; Not to mention the archive footage is really neat and I liked hearing the difference between Woods and Nixon. You also learn that Natalie was not the only one whose vocals were replaced and the justification and the still now slightly wounded pride by the cast members is unintentionally funny. <BR>The book that comes with this is interesting eye candy, but really not that useful. I think an audio commentary would have been much more appreciated.<BR>However despite the criticism, I'm glad I got the disc. <BR>The packaging is great, the sound is outstanding and the picture quality does the film justice. The special features may less than expected, but it's a great addition for a collector and fans of the genre. Solid &quot;B&quot; rating.
B00008RH3L|5.0|The Coen Brothers throw all the style they can muster at the gangster genre, and the result is splendiforous!<BR>Miller's Crossing wasn't apperciated at the time of its release. In some ways, it out Tarantinos Taratino, before there was a Tarantino. But beyond all the stylish direction and amazing visuals, the story doesn't disappoint.<br />DO YOURSELF A FAVOR. If you think you love movies, and you haven't seen this one, BUY IT.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is arguably (no, UN-arguably) the best rock album ever. If you are a music lover, it is essential to have this cd is your possession, and not only listen to it, but explore it past it's most famous songs like &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; and &quot;Come as You Are&quot;. Everyone has their own special favorite on the disc (mine being &quot;Lounge Act&quot;). Listen to every song: the inspired lyrics, the sheer musicianship, and how incredibly DIFFERENT it is from anything else. There are hard songs, there are dofter songs, angry songs and reflective, but they are all brilliant.
0441172717|4.0|Dune is simply amazing.  The book is even more in depth than the movies.  I had never read the books before, but I recently saw the Children of Dune mini-series, and it got me interested.  I'm sorry I didn't pick up this book sooner, it's excellent.<br />The sad part is, that the mass market paper back edition is poorly produced.  My main gripe is that the margin is way to close to the binding of the book.  I have to come close to destroying the thing just to bend the book open enough so I can so those words down the inside edge of the paper.<br />I heavily reccomend Dune to anyone who's a sci fi fan.  I also reccomend picking up a different printing of the book.

0316666343|1.0|I looked forward to reading this book, however, found it to be predictable and mediocre.A tragic beginning was a ploy to hold my interest, but it was lost like the victim.

B00005NB8K|4.0|What a shame the director Oliver Stone (Or former DOORS members) didn't insist on keeping details accurate about Jim Morrison and the musical group he lead during the late 60s! I have read a biography of Jim Morrison, and there was SO much material to work with that ACTUALLY happened. Why do the movies have to \\"invent\\" past events? I'll give examples in a minute, but the reason I am upset is that Val Kilmer played Jim Morrison so convincingly that this was a colossal waste for Oliver Stone and company not tell Jim's life-story truthfully!<br />*SPOILERS*- you may not want to read if you haven't seen movie- <BR>I can understand the Indian spirit that pops up occasionally in the movie (even though I doubt that ever happened) because at least there was a connection to Jim's life- when he was a child he saw American Indians injured on a highway and believed one of the dying Indian's soul entered his mind (there is a line in the song \\"Peace Frog\\" about that). I understand creative touches that don't take away from the facts of a true story or biography. Here's where I have a problem: THESE THINGS I AM ABOUT TO LIST *NEVER* HAPPENED (outright lies):<br />1) Jim did NOT quit film school. He graduated and then teamed up with THE DOORS.<BR>2) Jim's live-in girlfriend Patty (spelling?), played well by Meg  Ryan, became friends with Jim's mistress when they actually met (remember the Thanksgiving scene when there is a \\"catfight\\"- no way that happened) I doubt the \\"other woman\\" drank blood either.<BR>3) There was never a \\"Light My Fire\\" commercial (scene when Jim supposedly has a fit when he sees commercial on television).<BR>4) Andy Warhol incidents never occurred, at least I never read about it, and there were PLENTY of more interesting stories from Jim's life like when he was hit over the head by a whiskey bottle from Janis Joplin.<br />Anyway, I hate to be so negative because the movie got some things right, like the band's one and only performance on THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW.I felt like the film had so much potential but only delivered about half of what was capable. Too bad!

0688170528|4.0|This is the first novel that I read by Jodi Picoult.  I was just passing by it in the bookstore and picked it up on a whim, (which is something I never do) because I thought the art on the cover was interesting, But in this case boy, am I glad I did!! The story centers around two families: the Hartes and the Golds.  They have lived next door to each other for years, shared their homes and their lives, not to mention raised their children together.  So, it stands to reason that Emily Harte grow up as best friends and become lovers.  The reader really becomes immersed in the book very early on when Chris becomes embroiled in the drama of a suicide pact gone awry.  Jodi Picoult rally has a knack for writing about rather disturbing subjects with a cast of characters that the reader really learns to care about.
0060012218|5.0|This book is an awsome book. Brent makes the characters come to life and you can't help but feel like you actually know the chracters. Very touching story that gets every emotion possible into your head. Finally a good book for gays, lesbians, and bisexuals, but definately not reserved to only them. May help with understanding what gays, lesbian and bisexuals live with. I absolutely loved the book and I think EVERYONE should at least attempt to read it.

B00005QFE5|3.0|I find it unsettling if not downright scary that almost all the reviews I have seen thus far in Amazon for this movie scream \\"excellent\\", for I find this as one of Zhang Yi Mou's less inspired and less riveting movies.  As I watched the first ten to fifteen minutes of the movie, I wanted to give myself the benefit of the doubt I was having, for there was nothing, other than the scene of a man going home to a remote village (which could be somewhere in Xinjiang), that I found as an indication that this WAS GOING to be another one of Zhang Yi Mou's cinematic jewels.<br />Perhaps it was the plot, or perhaps it was an overblown focus on his young and very attractive actress, who clearly was a replacement for the unfortunately aging but always-the-arresting-persona that was Gong Li.  The camera did the younger actress plenty of justice, and I could sense that she and the director would have many more movies to come.  Hopefully, Zhang Yi Mou can recreate the same kind of arresting and captivating movies that he had made with Gong Li.<br />But for this movie, it did not have many of the elements that wowed me when I saw \\"Raise the Red Lantern\\", \\"To Live\\", and \\"Shanghai Triad\\".  I consider \\"To Live\\" as a masterpiece, and whenever I watch it, even in my overworn VHS tape, I can always sense the vision and inspiration it took to create such a dramatic saga of many generations through sweeping socioeconomic and political changes in China (I am hoping for the day when the DVD of \\"To Live\\" comes out!).  I guess it would not be fair to use \\"To Live\\" as a golden standard against which \\"The Road Home\\",  a movie with a simple plot and minimal characters, can be compared.  I should check out \\"Not One Less\\", also by Zhang Yi Mou, since this movie is just as recent as \\"The Road Home\\", and the theme of teacher (albeit female) in a remote village is similar to \\"The Road Home\\".<br />I give it, however, three stars, because of the outstanding photography.  The music was decent, although again, not as memorable, as the musical score in \\"To Live\\".<br />For melodramatic Chinese movies, Chen Kaige's \\"The King of Masks\\"  also sits on that much higher plane in my opinion.ain, not as memorable, as the musical score in \\"To Live\\".  <br />For melodramatic Chinese movies, Chen Kaige's \\"The King of Masks\\"    also sits on that much higher plane in my opinion.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is not a review of the movie, but rather of the DVD.  If you are getting this DVD because you think you might enjoy the movie you will, and if you saw the movie but aren't sure about spending some money on the DVD, well, you should.  If you liked the movie, you'll definitely want to get this DVD and the extras that it offers.  Basically, if you took the time to look into this DVD and read this review I think are someone who should buy the DVD.  However, the extras aren't all they are cracked up to be as is often the case in DVDs and I want everyone out there to know what to expect.<br />There are 20 deleted or extended included in this DVD, but each on has to be played separately (no 'Play All' feature) and you must select commentary on/off for each one of them.  This is not the best arrangement for a deleted/extended scenes section.  The actual content of this section is pretty decent with most of the scenes having the possibility of really having added something to the story and most could've made the film had the director not had to cut the film down to 2 hours from the original rough cut of about 2 and half hours it originally had.<br />There are two commentaries on the DVD, one with the Richard Kelly (writer/director) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie) and another with Richard Kelly, two producers (Nancy Juvonen and Sean McKittrick) and several cast members: Holmes Osborne (Eddie, Donnie's Dad), Mary McDonnell (Rose, Donnie's Mom), Jimmy Duval (Frank), Beth Grant (Kitty Farmer, Donnie's Health Teacher), Drew Barrymore (Karen Pomeroy, Donnie's English Teacher), Katharine Ross (Dr. Thurman, Donnie's Therapist), and Jena Malone (Gretchen, Donnie's Girlfriend). First, the sound quality of the commentaries is below what one has to come to expect on commentaries.  You can hear the commentary track fine, but the track of the movie itself is all but silent during the time in which the cast or crew is speaking, almost shut off which is a turn to many people (but you canput on closed caption, although that can often distract you from the commentary if you are reading it), and it is back to full regular volume when their is no active commentary. My only complaint on the second commentary is that Drew Barrymore often `hogs' the commentary and was way to close to the microphone (which only accented her shrill voice on this commentary) during the recording of the commentary, she tried to hard to be `deep' in her comments way too often and it gets annoying at times.  Many of the tidbits and insights provided in both tracks are interesting and above par with many other movie commentaries, but by no means exceptional.  It is fun listening to what Kelly and the others have to say and then watching the movie looking for these things on your own, but don't only watch the film looking for hints that the director left for the audience and nothing else; this takes away too much from the film, so don't do that.<br />The theatrical trailer is above average and can be appreciated by both those that have already seen the film and those than haven't.  The several TV spots, all 30 seconds or less, are largely repetitious.<br />The cast &amp; crew information section is above average listing all of the actors' other films through late 2002 (most DVDs list only some films and are not current beyond the movie on the DVD).  There is a total of nine crew bios (as opposed to a simple list of past work) including Richard Kelly, Sean McKittrick, Nancy Juvonen, Steve Poster (director of photography), Alexander Hammond (production designer), April Ferry (costume designer), Eric Strand (editor), Sam Bauer (editor), and Michael Andrews (composer).<br />The `Mad World' music video is OUTSTANDING, and I have seen it many, many times already.  It is quite addicting, and even if I close my eyes and just listen to it, it is still great.<br />The `Website Gallery' is very hard to see and is not anything special and does not add anything to the DVD.  What is shown is really a sampling of what the website has to offer, which is somewhat hard to navigate but during the cast and crew commentary they give you the three passwords for levels one, two and three if you listen closely.<br />The `Soundtrack' feature provides interesting linear notes, but is not an isolated soundtrack of the movie (which is really the score of the movie with the lone exception the `Mad World' Tears for Fears songs covered so eerily by Gary Jules for the movie).<br />The `Cunning Visions' section features the infomercials from in the movie with optional directors commentary).  There is also a `His Name is Frank' section that is a fun little feature of several place cards that are designed like those featured in the Cunning Visions `exercise' in Donnie's health class and shown during Jim Cunningham's assembly.  You can also look at the book covers used for Jim Cunningham's two books feature as background material during his assembly at the school.<br />`The Philosophy of Time Travel' book feature is disappointing showing only several pages (including the appendices featured in the film) and all the pages are hard to see.<br />The `Art Gallery section' is neat with a bunch of artwork that inspired works in the film and some of which was used directly in the film.  The production stills are plentiful and interesting.<br />The `Scene Selection' feature is as good as any other DVD with moving images as opposed to stills to mark each chapter, and there are a total of 28; good for a 2 hour movie.<br />Overall, I enjoyed this DVD especially the `Mad World' music video and the two commentaries as I personally enjoy the opportunity to see the entire movie a different way when I can and the commentary tracks give me this opportunity.

Harper, like one of my unsung musical heroes, Will Kimbrough, is obviously a student of music.  Yet, also like Kimbrough, while his songs give a nod to others before him, ultimately they are nobody's but his, each imbued with his own style and a little piece of himself.  You can't go wrong here.

B0000033WC|2.0|Get this if you're mostly a Lou Reed fan; the Velvet Underground this is NOT! This is Lou's project. The songs are nice, but it's NOT the Velvet Underground. The VU is John, Moe, Sterl &amp; Lou(with Nico). Moe wasn't even around for the recording of LOADED; it was basically Lou, a little bit of Sterling, Doug Yule and his brother filling for Moe. The Velvet Underground(the 3rd album) functions MUCH better as a post-Cale Velvets album...it still retains that minimalistic experimentalism. LOADED sounds desparate for hits...it sounds forced. Ofcourse, this is just me.

0679720200|5.0|Our society has a weird setup, which is something that i realized a few years ago.  It's one that has morale, values and belief systems that practically everyone accepts in one way or another, but often contradicts.  although the fact that moral is a belief is something that we should all get credit for.  so what happens if you have a disaffected, amoral non-believer present in the society?  that's the question that camus examines in \\"the stranger\\" and gives its readers an answer i don't think many were prepared for.<BR>    the novel has a pretty simple plot.  it's about a young man named mersualt who has a job, lives in a flat, has a girlfriend, and committs murder by accident.  he's sent to trial and the jury decides to execute him by guillotene.  <BR>     that's the book on a shallow front but it really folds into a character study of a young man who has been abandoned by morals, values and traditional views by standard society.  mersualt is concerned mostly with the present and not thoughtful about the future.  he gets excited over jumping on a car, but turns an opportunity to get married, change jobs and move.  his concern is mostly over physical sensation and morals take a backseat.  he is observant and at times self centered. he doesn't reflect on his views and values until he's forced to and his physical desires are left empty.<BR>    camus does a great job in \\"the stranger\\" because it examines part of our value system and demostrates that some people may be closer to being amoral than they want to think.  when i first read the novel i was about 15 and i thought it was cool odyseey into a character who reveals thoughts and does things that i don't think many people have the gaul to do.  i read it a second time in my English class and a lot of people had adverse reactions to it.  most people were stuck on the murder, his language, and how dare he hang out with pimps and talk about his girlfriend so carelessly!  where are his morals!  so during a discussion ihappened to say that the character just didn't have a concrete view on what's good or bad, nor were his values determined by society's standards.  for example, he doesn't cry during his mother's funeral.  well, i didn't cry during my father's and i was 10.  does that mean that i am an example of evil?  no.  mersualt (and i) both see death a natural act, although it's standard convention for someone to be extremely mournful at a funeral. in other words, common morals are sort of a way to bond people and add value to life.  if people at least have the belief then they are still people, right?  mesualts views are determined by his own standards, and he didn't really have a reason to be concerned about other people and their current state until his life depends on it.<BR>    the reason why the stranger was such a profound book is because of the reaction that it got out of people.  i can say this, because most of my classmates were disgusted with mersualt and i had to say that people treat others like this all the time.  and it's also an examination of the concious that a lot of people are unwilling to admit to.  mersualt is not sugarcoated by society's standards, although he is broght to trial for that.<BR>      the other characters are central to the story as well.  marie is devoted to sensual pleasures as much as mersualt, and the pimp (sorry, i forgot his name) sees mersualt as a good person.  other characters saw him as weird.  their interpretation of mersualt, who demonstrates camus' rule of absurdity is a representation on society's interpretation of the rule itself.  <BR>     the stranger is all too familiar in our society and presents an alternative in the rule of absurdity which could be accepted with a few changes.  the stranger provokes, assualts and challenges the belief systems of current society, which is a question that will always remain contemporary although the book is about 80 years old.  i tip my hat off to camus.  this book is not a must read that can easily be discarded.  it should be required of everyone in order to gain insight into our world, the validity of our beliefs and understanding of ourselves.

0451527046|2.0|I read Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. I found this book to be not so enjoyable. It begins with slow, hard to follow beginning, and continues with a somewhat sped up middle with many confusing twists and new people. The end I also found to be boring. This just seemed like a short story streched out on many pages lots of new places, characters, or things in between.<BR>     The parts of this book that I could follow along with were few and even still not inturesting. It took effort to read and keep everything in your head. I had to read over many things twice.<BR>    Some of the characters are Jim,Jim's mom,Dr. Livesey,Pew, Admiral Benbow,and others. Jim is the boy who goes on the adventures with the pirates. Jim worked an inn with his mom and dad. A sstrangwe visitor came around that was a pirate. Jim's dad died and so did the pirate... which is where Black Dog came and Jim's whole adventure started. He traveled across seas to find treasure, and he thought that the island was scary and haunted.<br />If you are an advanced reader, who can keep up with many things I might suggest this to you. If you are inturested in a fantasy like story with pirates, you also may enjoy this. However if you are an average person who just enjoys casually reading or you like to have a book that leaves you on the edge, I would have to say you would not want to read this.
0316096199|5.0|LUCKY, a memoir of a rape and its aftermath by Alice Sebold, author of THE LOVELY BONES, is a remarkable piece of writing. Twenty-two years ago, the legal and health systems were not attuned to the rape victim and were positioned to make a terrible situation even more dehumanizing. Sebold was lucky, she was told, that the rapist left physical damage to back up her claims, that she was a virgin going into the experience and thus to be accorded more respect, that she wasn't in the same place some days before-in a park near her college campus-when another young woman was raped and killed. Sebold reports the events of the rape in unswerving, unsensational journalistic fashion at the outset of the book. From there she shares something of her childhood in suburban Philadelphia, to help the reader understand who she was and how that helped shape what happened next after the rape, the impact on her family, friends and college community, and on her own choices. Woven in and out of the narrative is the story of how Sebold encounters her attacker on the street months later and pursues him through the legal system. One of the shocking discoveries she makes is how unusual she is in that pursuit; most women were defeated in the process or did not have the wherewithal to initiate it. Sebold probably would not describe herself as courageous, but it becomes apparent, the further you read into the book, that she is very courageous on many levels. She is also downright likeable, though she isn't asking the reader to like her.<br />It is also apparent that even if our health, emergency, college safety departments, municipal police services, and judicial systems have grown more sensitive to the rape victim in recent years, there remains the problem of how the victim and the people around her make sense and make progress after the event. Emotionally, Sebold was left very much on her own, and while she marches forward, graduating from college on time, accumulating some typical college experiences along the way, it is with some surprise years later that the internal healing process had really yet to begin. As she heads into recovery, Sebold closes the door to outside scrutiny and that's okay: she has already given us what we really need to know.

B00008GKEG|5.0|If you're a hard core Beatle fan, you will definitely like The Beatles Anthology released on DVD.<br />A great job was done in restoring the video clips of the band's performances in the clubs, the recording studio, the television shows, and in concerts.  With four track recording the only process to capture music back in the early sixties, the engineers who remastered these tapes produced a very enjoyable, crisp listening experience.<br />The first four DVDs have the programs with extra footage.  A fifth DVD is included that has Paul, George, and Ringo together in 1996 recollecting about the band and performing five songs together.  There is also documentary of how the Anthology CDs, that were released before the DVD set, were put together.
B00008A7HZ|5.0|Delta's debut album was highly anticipated in Australia, and in the week it was released, it shot straight to number one, with her second single 'Lost Without You' still in the top five.<br />This album is absolutely fantastic. Delta wrote/co-wrote all but two songs on the album, most of the songs being about her own experiences.<br />In the tradition of \\"Born to Try', the album offers such ballads as 'Not me, Not I', 'A Year Ago Today',  and 'Will You Fall For Me'.<br />More upbeat tracks such as 'My Big Mistake' and 'Running Away' will have you singing with your hairbursh in front of the mirror.<br />Delta also shows a darker side with 'Predictable', a very addictive track.<br />I love all the songs on the album, but my favourites are 'Innocent Eyes', 'Not Me, Not I', 'My Big Mistake', 'Longer' and my absolute favourite, the beautiful 'Butterfly'.<br />I'm seeing Delta in concert next week and I am so excited.<br />I highly recommend this album to anyone who appreciates good music.<br />Delta is an artist we are sure to hear a lot from in the future.
B00005OWEG|5.0|I seen this movie many times but the Redux version is possibly as good as it gets. With the extra scenes the movie totals to almost 3 hours and I gurantee that it is a very fast three hours. The characters that Martin Sheen, and Laurence Fishburne play show their strengths and just one reason why they are still acting in films today. It is truly a war-epic/thriller film in a catastrophic atmosphere where at night the sky glows brightly from all the fires shot out from all different weapons and in the daytime all types of threatining force hide out and wait to attack. This is a movie for the serious watcher.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|This film is dazzling and fantastic, and in buying the DVD you get more information and the picture is better, it's worth every penny.<BR>  Every one who has seen Moulin Rouge or Romeo+Juliet knows that Baz is a flashy guy with new ideas, clearly shown in this movie, about professional ballroom dancers, one of whom, Scott, is bored with the standard and excepted steps. He makes up incredible gymnastic crowdpleasing moves, but the professionals hate them, and they lose a competition because of them. He upsets his partner, Liz, and has to find a new one.<BR>  I won't say more, so as not to ruin anything, but I have to comment, doesn't Fran over-react to the Tina Sparkle thing? Oh well.<BR>  I would recommend this movie to anyone, but I do have to comment on the predictability. Then again, what was the last UNpredictable movie? Ocean's Eleven? Sixth Sence?<BR>  Still, a fascinating peice of eye-candy with great charectors and great dances performed by great actor/dancers.
6305313687|5.0|I seen a documentary on the making of this film and I found it interesting how artist Tony Kaye put everyone through so much bull because he wanted to edit the movie since he was the one who directed it. After viewing the film like alot of the excellent films I seen I strongly disagree with the director's attitude on the film being unfinished. I think whoever edited this piece knew what an audience would associate most with the characters and made the film successful. If you are into movies where people go against the grain and lose all their connections in order to make things a little better then this movie displays it with tremendous and powerful emotion

B00003CXWV|4.0|When this movie started and Johnny Depp was using the voice over to introduce the audience to his childhood and Ray Liotta pops out of frikkin' nowhere it reminded me of that same Goodfellas drive that this movie offers. Don't confuse yourself with what I say, this movie is definitely not as close as good to Goodfellas but if has a decent story line of the life of the first man to bring cocaine into the u.s.(yeah right!) to deal it. This movie has a good cast and I don't really mind that they [copied] the same narrative structure from Goodfellas, I thought the movie was decent and was good at portraying the life of a drug dealer. If your into movies about crime and trying to achieve the 'impossible' then this is definitely worth a look!
6305313687|5.0|To be brutally honest, after seeing American History X, I'd have to say it's one of my favorite films ever...if not my single favorite. The movie teaches a much more broader about racism or neo-Nazism...it teaches you how hate gets society no where. Edward Norton does a magnificent job of acting in the movie. It was a bit melodramatic at times, but that doesn't take away from the fact that the plot is a masterpiece. The climax of the movie and the ending are also some of the best for its genre. <br />I'd recommend this movie to anyone...life lessons can be learned from a simplest of places.
B000001IPP|4.0|This album shows how rancid became as successful as they did when they released '...and out come the wolves' right after this one. The songs are very chantful and Tim Armstrongs snarling of street and alley life are truly unique to the punk genre. This album is a definite staple in the punk rock category and holds up just as well as their next release!
B00005QHPQ|5.0|I'm just gonna make it short and sweet! This is a great CD! With the up beat and slow songs its a terrific CD! If you liked his other CDs then you'll love this one just as much!
B00005MAM2|5.0|I finally found a tin copy of the Akira movie and picked it up when I first laid eyes on it. There are to many things in the special features to mention of but the film itself was worth every penny. Watching Akira I felt like visiting a different world in a different time. The city is so big and the speed of the animation is like nothing I've ever seen before. Otomo who created most of the story explains his process with an hour long interview and an important lesson in doing dynamic storylines and transferring it to a film maker's order. This film in the Anime genre is a must buy or a must steal. Just see it for yourself!
0375823360|5.0|Ok, i've read through many of the reviews and in a few there is an obvious dislike of this trilogy for reasons of literary \\"flaws.\\"  I agree that there is a lacking of information in some areas and a general lacking of characterizations and explainations of complicated events, yet to me, literature of this sort is a means of sparking ideas into the readers and open their imaginations to new planes of thought.  When you read with your mind open and your heart too, everything flows quite wonderfully, and Pullman paints a wonderfully brilliant world full of life and movement at every turn.  Personally i think the plot is golden and very very BIG...perhaps that is why Pullman was unable to tie together every loose end he had created, but that is no reason to shun such a wonderful and explosive novel.  Yes, i would have liked to see a few different things happen in the third book, yet I would still recommend this trilogy to anyone.  This is one of the most exciting and profound fantasy/sci-fi series i've read since i don't know when.  OH and just a message to all you conservative people, Loosen UP!  People who reject this book because of it's theme and message really didn't understand it at all, read it yourself...And i DO think this is an excellent read for both adults AND kids alike.  (especially teens.)
0345451325|5.0|This book was excellent. I have Halo and have beat it on three levels. It was amazing before I read the book, but now that I have it clears up any of my questions about the game. It made the game just that much better. This book is filled with suspense and action on every page. I absolutely loved it. I think I read it faster than I've ever read any other book.
B000002UB3|4.0|I think people like the Beatles more because they're supposed to, than from an actual musical interest. Their enormous popularity, and catchy songs earn the Beatles their right to be liked by people. On the other hand, Dylan was a better songwriter, Hendrix was a better musician, and Joplin was a better performer. The Beatles are sort of a watered down stew of all these three rolled into one, which is alright. But in a world full of musical vomit, the Beatles are okay in my book.
B00006ALGL|5.0|This cd is a brilliant masterpiece. From the pristine vocals in \\"Volcano\\" to the somehow harmonious confusion of \\"Eskimo\\", this album defies the original boundaries set forth for a rock, pop, or even folk record. <br />The subtle, yet intricate self narrtives (assumingly) about Rice's own life constantly flow over pleasing melodies. What results is a soothing work of art. <br />Damien Rice is destined for glory, but whether that glory will be confined to his home country of Ireland or not is yet to be determined.
0871137380|5.0|This was a very accurate account of this event. I would suggest to anyone who wants a clear picture of what happened in this fight that they read the book and let the movie fall second behind what is reality. Everyone should read this book to know a little bit more about the sacrifices that soldiers have to make when in the line of duty. It's a very sobering affect and should make you very proud to be an American. Only people who have been there and know what it's like truly have a right to criticize any military actions taken on for the sake of freedom and democracy. People who don't know better and who don't live in this country should keep their mouths closed.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I have to say that Im a big fan of No doubt, and Ive bought all of their albums, but Rock Steady is the best, I know that theres a lot of people that think that it is strange, compared to their previous works, but hey, they are growing up, they cant play the same music always, and they proove it here, the only song that I dont like is &quot;waiting room&quot; (produced by Prince), it is kind of boring, but the rest of the album is awesome, my favorites are: Hella Good, Making out, Detective, Dont let me down and Platinum Blonde life.

B00005JKG7|5.0|A great film festival would be John Carpender's &quot;Assault of precinct 13&quot;, &quot;Halloween&quot;, &quot;The Fog&quot; and &quot;The Thing&quot;.  I love what this man does with characters and mood.  The other reviewers have certainly gone over the plot in detail so I will reflect mostly on what Carpender does best.  He takes a wide variety of people, lets you know just enough about them, and then adds those special moments of life that force them to interact under the most stressful of situations (oncoming doom).  Halloween was the exception in that Jamie Lee Curtis was on her own.  The music, again, becomes a character in how it puts you in the right mood for whatever's coming.  The only annoyance was the little kid who just couldn't figure out that he shound RUUUUUN! away from the bad people.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This is a fun, catchy album. I wouldn't expect too much from this album- it is what it is! The first release from two teens with strong and pleasant vocals. They have a lot to say and are supported by awesome beats/tunes. I think it's good to put out there 'pro-lesbian lyrics' (if you will) and a little controversy for more PR is not such a bad thing either. If you are not uncomfortable with what these girls have to say/sing - which isn't really 'in your face' nor mentioned much anyway- then you'll likely enjoy this album. Hopefully they will release a more vocally-refined follow-up album within a decent amount of time as well.
B00007H1Y2|5.0|I guess words like \\"lounge\\", \\"pop\\" and all of the other cheap, easy terms reviewers like to use have their place. If you look under one of those categories in the local record store you'll find some 'product' excreted specifically for that category.<br />But those words don't really have any place in reviewing a recording made for the pure joy and uplift of playing and hearing music. To refer to the selection or the instrumentation as \\"cheesy\\" is the best evidence yet of someone listening to music with a deaf ear. <br />These guys play together with the highest levels of empathy, skill and inspiration. This music will reward anybody who actually listens to it. This is my favorite Cooder record since Chicken Skin Music in '76. <br />I admit to a reasonable level of subjectivity. Cooder's been a great inspiration to many of us in the musician tribe for the last 30 or so years. I've made my living as a musician for many years and done the usual stuff: recordings, studio work, performing and teaching, so I have a pretty good idea of what it took to make a record this gorgeous. <br />This is a great recording. It'll be liked or disliked by people, but the quality of the music doesn't diminish because of casual opinions.<br />Think it's cheesy? Then YOU record something more moving, rather than just yapping about it.
B000066NW0|4.0|Avril Lavigne's first album &quot;Let Go&quot; is nice. This is *really* not my typical kind of music to listen to, but after hearing some of her songs on radio, I decided I should try listening to something different, and was suitably impressed. So why write a review when 1400+ other people already have, just to show my appreciatioin of a good work (Best Album of Year- Junos).  Not a punk album, somewhat of a pop album, but not the typical pop bs. &quot;Losing Grip&quot; starts off the album powerfully. Lead and hit single &quot;Complicated&quot; follows, and though the song has been killed on radio its good, positive upbeat track, the first time I heard it, knew I was listening to something different. Next come two more songs that have been made into videos &quot;Sk8r Boi&quot; and &quot;Im With You&quot;. First songs alright can see the appeal it has for some, the second however, &quot;Im With You&quot; is my favourite song on the album, standout song, about being alone, and reaching out, song really is  related to the feeling many young (and all) people feel, trying to make it on there own, Avrils vocal tones on this are amazing, love the way she expands and lowers tones. &quot;Tommorow&quot; is a kind of sad slow song which has main message of tommorow is another day, kind of gives hope that the future can be bright, to keep your head up. <BR>&quot;Anything but Ordinary&quot; is a introspective song, which makes you feel different emotions from sad to happy, but is essentially upbeat. &quot;My World&quot; is about Avrils life, growing up in a small town and wanting to get away. &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; is a song about being real with one's self and not giving into others pressure.  <BR>Albums closing track is &quot;Naked&quot; a slow melodic song. &quot;Let Go&quot; is   a memorable album from a talented young artist.
B0000507PC|4.0|The central character of this film at first sight appears to be Michael Caine's Dr Larch. It soon becomes apparent that the central role is of his unofficially adopted son, Homer Wells, played by Tobey Maguire. This is perhaps the only serious criticism of the film- I would have liked to have seen more of Larch, but Homer goes off and spends time with other, less interesting characters. It may be because I like Michael Caine or because his performance was strong enough to win him an Oscar, or just because the eccentric character is so different from  anything Caine has played before. This is not to diminish Maguire's performance; he comes through very strongly and is not overshadowed by the veteran actor. He plays Homer very much like John Boy Walton, an educated innocent who has outgrown his place of birth and needs to go out into the world to get some real learning. This is highlighted by the fact that he has had much experience of women's bodies in an gynaecological sense, but no intimate encounters of his own. Homer goes to work on a cider farm, and the people he meets there have a huge influence on his life. There is an amusing performance from rapper Heavy D, which nicely balances Delroy Lindo's hard man character. The music is layed on a bit too thickly at times and is in danger of swamping the production. Otherwise this is a top film.
0140186409|4.0|The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck took place in Oklahoma.  Steinbeck shows many classic examples of the events in the 1930's.  For an example how farmers in the Dust Bowl suffered not only from the drought but the Depression also.  I liked how Steinbeck is always paying attention to detail when he describes the family's and the living conditions.<br />  The 1930's was a very bad time for this nation.  I think that Steinbeck not only shows the Depression setting but also what they done in order to survive.  Steinbeck gives many examples of how the family's lived and their everyday lives.  I think that this is important because unless you lived during the 1930's you wouldn't know how things were.<br /> He gives many examples along the journeys of the family's life from their home place to search for more work to feed their families.  By doing this it gives the reader a glimpse of how they might have had to live if they lived during that time period.  Sometimes it feels as if you are right there on the journey with the families.  Like the world today only the strong survived the Depression in the 1930's.  Some of the events that happen in The Grapes of Wrath are very sad and touching all at once.<br /> I suggest that if you want to learn about the Depression and the 1930's this is the book to read.  It is not only is packed full of examples but takes you along with the family's journey for success in California.  This book will make you glad that you're not in the Joad family's shoes.

0385504209|3.0|A fun grab bag!  There is much to enjoy in this collection of historical parlor games that Mr. Brown playfully cobbles together using the thriller format.  As near as I can tell, however, the lion's share of the grail storyline is lifted from HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL (a source Mr. Brown acknowledges in the text).  HBHG is itself best read as speculative historical fiction.  Readers interested in more of the straight historical record might want to check out Malcolm Barber's THE NEW KNIGHTHOOD (an objective and detailed history of the Templars), Susan Haskin's MARY MAGDALENE: MYTH AND METAPHOR, and, of course, the first (and possibly still the best) grail story, by French writer Chretien de Troyes.  His PERCEVAL, OR THE STORY OF THE GRAIL (1186) is the one that started all the centuries of &quot;rewrites&quot; and speculation.  It was a blockbuster in its day, and still reads beautifully -- full of wit, romance, adventure and authentic poetic mystery.
B000089RVX|2.0|I was extremely disappointed when I bought this cd a few days ago. The content was not very good. I was expecting a good, clean, entertaining cd and instead I found one that was quite disturbing. The lyrics main themes were breathing and bleeding. I had heard so many great things about this album, like how they were Christian (which they definitely are not), and their words were so great. The only positive thing I can find about this cd is that their music, especially guitar and piano, was very well done and they are talented musicians.
0812548094|5.0|First, I would like to state that I read almost all of the reviews of this book and I would like to tell you, the future reader, that almost every single bad review on this book on this site came from people that [obviously] did not really pay attention to what they were reading.  I am not saying that people couldn't dislike this book, but these specific reviewers missed so much that it is hard to believe that they did more than skim through the book.  If there is one thing that Goodkind does good, it is making sure that everything that happens CAN happen in his world and nothing is too far fetched.<br />While Goodkind does seem to take a lot from Robert Jordan, the overall story is completely compelling.  I spent hours upon hours reading this book because I could NOT put it down.  It seems like anything can happen and many times anything does.  Sometimes the conclusions are rushed and there are things that don't seem all that important, but there is always a fast pace that will make you want to know what happens next.  I must admit that I had a hard time getting though Khalan's first chapters and after she was alone and there were a few boring chapters in Galea I thought that either I didn't like the character or that her part in the book would be boring.  Trust me.  It is the best part of the book after you get past those few chapters of nothing.<br />If you are a fantasy reader and are not of the weak at heart.  You will love this book.  One word of advice though.  Try to read large chunks at one time or in one day.  If you try to read Goodkind and only read ten pages a day, you will NOT get the full effect of the book.  I'm not sure why, but with everyone I have talked to it is the same case.  Some I have talked to read it slowly and hated it.  I told them to go back and read more at a time and then they loved it.
B00003CXXM|5.0|The Bourne Identity is tightly crafted, gripping action-thriller with elements of espionage and fugitive films thrown in.  Despite its rather far-flung and somewhat murky plot, it delivers many thrills with intense and exciting action sequences.  <br />The movie opens with Matt Damon's character floating unconscious in the Mediterranean Sea in the middle of the night.  He is rescued from the water by a passing fishing vessel.  The boat captain, who inexplicably owns a set of surgical tools, finds two bullets lodged in his back and a laser device implanted in his hip. When activated, the laser reveals a Swiss bank account number.  However, he has no knowledge of who he is and no memory of how he got there.  <br />Upon reaching land, he takes a train to Zurich and accesses the safe-deposit box which, to his surprise, contains a stash of various currencies, several passports with his picture but different aliases, and a handgun.  He discovers that his name is Jason Bourne and that he maintains a residence in Paris.  Despite his amnesia, Bourne finds that he possesses superb martial arts skills and many uncanny abilities that would put 007 to shame.  Suddenly pursued by the authority, Jason convinces a distraught young woman named Marie to drive him to Paris for a ridiculous sum of money.  Marie becomes his reluctant companion after she discovers that her name and picture had become inexplicably linked to him.  Together they desperately race to discover his identity while evading mysterious and deadly assassins who hound their tracks. Somehow the key to his mystery is a flamboyant African leader in exile who publicly maintains that he's the target of assassination attempts by the CIA.<br />Throug most of the movie we witness events as they unfold from Bourne's perspective.  From time to time we see glimpses of Bourne's former superiors who try to track him down with high-tech surveillance and spy gadgets.  Bourne, in the words of his former boss, is a \\"malfunctioning 30-million-dollar weapon\\".  He is deadly armed and unarmed, speaks several languages, has superb observation skills and drives a car like a stuntman.  However, unlike Bond, his primary role is assassination; he and others like him operate anonymously and without glamor or glory. He doesn't get to save the world; he's just trying to survive.  In this day and age, the notion that such superagents exist and are employed by none other than the CIA is intriguing if rather far-fetched.<br />Matt Damon delivers a subdued performance and is credible in the title role, even though his boyish look belies somewhat his role as a professional killer.  Sometimes he appears lost and confused, sometimes he has a dangerous streak, but at all times he exudes cool-headedness and control.  He effectively conveys compassion hidden beneath a deadly facade.  Franka Potente, in her big-budget debut, is great as the love interest.  I've liked her ever since Run Lola Run.  Besides being attractive, she has an appealing mix of innocence and edginess to her.  As Bourne's former boss, Chris Cooper seems to have nailed down the role of a cocky, authoritative military figure that he portrayed in American Beauty.<br />The cinematography is excellent.  The European locations, primarily Paris, are gorgeous.  The actions are fast and furious.  In particular, the car chase through the narrow, crowded, maze-like streets of Paris is the most viscerally exciting in recent memory.  What's the fun of a car chase if it takes place over straight, wide boulevards with no traffic!  No, Paris is the perfect location, with its ancient cobblestoned streets and stately brick buildings; one gets a sort of guilty pleasure at such recklessness and mayhem.  There are no eye-popping pyrotechnics or stunt cars flying through the air.  Instead, what you get is furious, gut-wrenching twists and turns.  They were driving a Mini, and you can almost feel every jaw-rattling bump and jar.  In the end, you don't see a car flipping over in slow motion; instead, the fugitives scoot down a tunnel, switch off the engine, and let out a breath.  When they do, so would the audience.  <br />The martial art sequences are exciting and highly stylized, with judicious use of fast- and slow-motion.  They almost remind me of The Matrix, but then again practically everything resembles The Matrix nowadays.  The climactic gun battle features an very cool stunt, one that would take the audience by surprise as much as it does the nemesis.<br />If you're looking for non-stop, adrenaline-charged thrills, this one won't disappoint.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I must say that the new White Stipes Album is quite an impressive album. Although I was expecting something along the line of the last album, this one sounds even better than White Blood Cells! The great thing about this album is it has more depth to it, jack white's songwriting has evolved for the better and overall, this album has a british-invasion tone to it. with jack also maning the bass, this album is a must buy.
B00005JLT5|4.0|A picture is better than a thousand words. This saying is especially true for The Pianist, a film based on the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman who escaped the fate of being put into concentration camp and survived in Warsaw by a fluke. That is not to downgrade or take anything away from the Mr. Szpilman's memoir that procreates a personal attachment to Szpilman. Director Roman Polanski commented, 'Until The Pianist, I have never read a piece so moving that I felt I had to bring it to the screen.' <br />On September 23, 1939, Szpilman played Chopin's Nocturne in C-sharp Minor live on the radio as shells exploded outside in Warsaw. The bombing was so loud that he could not even hear his piano. It was the day that marked the last airing of Warsaw radio station. The city went starkly quiet as the Germans laid out boundaries of Jewish Ghetto and roamed through which to manhunt Jews to be hurled into concentration camps. Though he lost his entire family, Szpilman survived in hiding, in homes of his non-Jewish friends, in attics of empty apartments, in rubbles. A German officer who heard him play the same Chopin nocturne on a piano found among the rubble saved his life. <br />The Pianist achieves the same caliber of sobriety and grief though this filming does not take into the concentration camps. The scenes of Szpilman's parting from his own family is just as provocative as the horrible bloodshed images shown in many documentary films. Viewers immediately develop a personal and sentimental tie with Szpilman and feel his pain. The film, for the most part, delineates life in Warsaw during the occupation and the starkness of which lends it a verisimilitude that no other filming can afford. The quietude and the prolonged shots generate a sense of imminent danger, threat, and premonition. When is Szpilman going to be caught? What will he do when he runs out of food? Will shrapnel kill him? The mental threat is far greater than physical suffering. In the sense the film is powerful in what it doesn't do. <br />The film is almost 2 hours and 30 minutes long and yet none of the scenes are excessively long. The prolonged shots produce an ominous effect that is crucial in setting the mood of the film. Andrien Brody's performance is superb as if he himself went through the fugitive life. Brody really acts out the physical disintegration and emotional devastation of the protagonist. He has adroitly projected Szpilman's refusal to die and his endurance to live. The fact that Roman Polanski himself is a Holocaust survivor makes the film a valuable piece of the Holocaust history and its studies. 4.5 stars.
B000068FUS|4.0|Truth in advertising. \\"Southern Rock Opera\\" is exactly what it announces in its title. A 2 CD opus that doesn't merely recount the rise and fall of Lynyrd Skynyrd, but uses the tragic story of that classic band as a thread to hang ruminations on life, death, and all things south of the Mason-Dixon line. The clean three-guitar attack of Skynyrd has been updated into punky blasts of murky alt.country, with the band's twang and drawl front-and-center. Kinda fun, kinda profound, and - by the end of the 8 minute closer \\"Angels and Fuselage\\" - kinda heartwrenching.
B00002DEQQ|5.0|I always thought Tom was a cool dude, but this CD just proves it for once and for all.<br />I was on a Qantas flight from Perth to Sydney last month, and they played a live concert of his on the plane. He blew me away with how much energy he still has, and how good his voice is after all these years.<br />Now, I'm over here in England on business and I drop into an HMV. I see this CD on sale, and I am like \\"what the heck, it looks interesting...\\"<br />Get it back to my friend's house here, pop the CD in and BAM!!!<br />Every song a winner here, folks. \\"Are you gonna go my way\\", \\"I'm left, you're right, she's gone\\", You need love like I do\\", all are standouts for sure.<br />One caveat - somebody PLEASE remix this one and get Chrissy Hynde out of \\"Lust for life\\". Tom has a strong voice, and she sounds like she's sleepwalking through the song. Tom does a bang up job on this one though - just like he does on every other song here. <br />Tom, you ROCK, dude!<br />Buy this CD, folks. Your ears will love you for it.<br />Frank
B000002MM8|5.0|I think this album is the best one. I listen it every day and Dead Can Dance is one of the most wonderfull, fantastic, genial group.
B00000373U|5.0|This is a melancholy cd with 12 tracks of brilliantly mournful tunes. If you're into sad songs and ballads (of big nothing), then you've found the right guy. Smith, a heroin addict during much of his peculiar career, has an incredible, seraphic voice, and inventive melodies that will make you feel despondent or happy. Either/Or. Personally, I think the songs are very bleek and depressing, but they're also so stark and sincere that you may feel a warm happiness from the sheer beauty of the songs. I highly recommend Say Yes, Ballad of Big Nothing, Between the Bars, and Alameda for some happy/sad, ambivalent listening.
B000002GIE|5.0|If anybody out there wonders if Nuno Bettencourt's musical style (or everybody else in the band) wasn't influenced by Van Halen, then this album will be your answer.  As for all this &quot;It's SO uneven&quot; stuff?  COME ON!!  This is their first album!!  Clearly, we hear their first attempts to shed their VH influence and try to create a style of their own.  A must have for any Extreme fan!!
B000068PQ0|5.0|This magnificent cd has received condign praises that surpass even the unparalled greatness of The Soft Bulletin. As this band progresses through its notable career, my appreciation for them augments as I hear each new recording. This disc is no exception. Although I thouroughly enjoyed The Soft Bulletin, I think Yoshimi is far more of a ground-breaking masterpiece then their previous effort. Each song propels itself through your ears in an unnerving manner that draws you in and bewitches you like very few cds I've heard. Every track is captivating, and there isn't one letdown on the whole cd. Fight Test, Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots Pt. 1, Are You A Hypnotist??, and Do You Realize?? are sure to thrive forever in the archives of historical, profound music.
0671027344|1.0|This is one of the worst books I have ever read. It is filled with one-dimentional side characters (your token gay guy, your token formerly promiscuous girl, your token abusive boyfriend, your token confused jock, your token liberal and accepting English teacher, ect.) as well as the most annoying and utterly braindead protagonist I have ever heard of. All Charlie does is sit around and obsess about others, never doing anything for himself. At the end of the novel, I was left wondering if he suffered from some form of high-functioning autism. He cannot write for himself; everything notable that he writes is either intended for Bill or the mysterious recepiant of his letters to read. To rub salt in the wounds that I personally endured reading this book, Charlie becomes a big fan of Ayn Rand's masterwork The Fountainhead and wonders what she would think of him. If any of you are at all acquainted with her Objectivist theory (living for yourself, not submitting to what others wish of you), then you will know exactly how infuriating this is to me.<br />Don't waste your time with this droll.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Kidman, McGrgor and Luhrmann combine in a brilliant whirl of vibrant colours and outstanding dances.  Australians Nicole and Luhrmann have shown the world some of their personal best in this movie( and Ewan isn't bad either!)  A fab. DVD!!
B00006LI4S|5.0|Gilmour has guitar chops, stage presence, as well as a body of work that even many of the great rockers would cringe jealously at.  And here he is with  a unique show, captured for us lucky humans on DVD.  He is tasteful, never overstated in this performance.  The accompanying musicians are just the right touch.  Comfortably Numb, Wish You Were Here, and Shine On You Crazy Diamond are, of course, awesome.  Even the Division Bell numbers are right on the money.  His voice is flawless, even well into his 50's. Where the hell did Pink Floyd come from?  How come they were so good?  I've always been convinced, even when I was a young teenager,  that they can't be explained by ordinary words.  My college roommate referred to them as God, I suppose the way people in the UK thought of Clapton back in the 1960's.  Gilmour may not be God, but his music is probably listened to by him!

B00006BTCA|5.0|Upon first listen to this album I thought \\"eh, this is pretty good\\". There were the standout songs that kinda tickled my ear,  but then after many more listens I started to realize something.  That this is how rock should be.  There is so much energy into this non energetic music.  Its sad and depressing, yet uplifting and fun at the same time.  The landscapes they create in my mind are beautiful and daring.  this is truly one of the best albums for the genre that I have heard in a very long time.<br />the opening track totally hinted to me that this wasnt going to be your typical album... very repetitive melodies, with smooth rarely heard monotone lyrics.<br />PDA was the first track that got my attention, with the galloping drums, and the break down with the guitars pounding. oh so glorious.<br />the stick out track for me is Stella Was A Diver And She Was Always Down.
B00003CWTI|4.0|OK...many people have said that this movie is weird or confusing.  I say it is movies like Magnolia that seperate movie fans into two categories:  those who are willing to think during a movie and those who just want to sit back and be entertained.  I think that Magnolia was a brilliant movie full of symbolism and art.  If you want a light, easy-to-watch movie, this is not the one for you.  If, on the other hand, you don't mind to think and take in the symbolism, sit back and relax...you're gonna love it.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Movie Musicals are back again...and better than ever! Chicago has an all star cast that is absolutely amazing. Catherine Zeta Jones deliveres a strong performance as Velma Kelly. Her singing is great,her dancing is fabulous, and her body is even better! She especially shines in my favoite number \\"Cell Block Tango.\\" Zellwegger is a faboulous Roxie Hart! Zellwegger shows off her amazing talents in numbers such as \\"Roxie\\" and the beautiful \\"Nowadays.\\" Richard Gere is phenomenal as Billy Flynn. His Razzle Dazzle truly is Dazzling and his tap dance is incredible! After seeing Chicago it is easy to see why it won the coveted Best Picture Award. Movie Musicals are back and are hopefully back to stay!!
0375413405|5.0|I think the best measure of a cookbook is how many times you have to practice to get a recipe right.  I had owned this book for a couple of months and had been regularly adding to my repertoir with gratin dauphinoise and steak au bercy when I came across a recipe for steak au bearnaise.  I knew little about bearnaise and hollandaise and less about making them.  Even with this it took only one try to get a perfect bearnaise to go with my steaks.  This book is the measure of delicious and authentic food as well as relative ease of use.
B000002UEB|5.0|If you ask this reviewer, two bands come to mind when thinking of progressive metal: Dream Theater and Queensryche. These two bands released perhaps the 2 best progressive metal albums ever recorded. Dream Theater's \\"Images and Words\\" was one of them, and the other is the topic of this review, Queensryche's \\"Operation: Mindcrime.\\"<br />Geoff Tate's vocal capabilities were tested for this album, and he passed with flying colors. Right off the bat, Queensryche intrigues us as they prepare to tell a story of a Reagan-era heroin addict named Nicky, who \\"works\\" for Dr. X, a Communist revolutionary bent on destroying a Reagan-era Democracy. Throughout the course of the story, Nicky falls for Mary, a prostitute who laters becomes a nun. When Nicky is ordered to kill Mary, he begins going through a transition that forces him to reflect on everything. The story is beautiful and touching, and it even tends to make a person reflect on their own lives. This album may even hold the answer you've been seeking for so long.<br />In the end, Operation: Mindcrime manages to satisfy even those with the shortest attention spans, and those who pay very little attention to detail. Beautiful music, a beautiful voice, a beautiful story... these make a beautiful album.
B00003CX95|5.0|I love it when a period film has it all and Braveheart is one of them. It deserved it's Oscar! It has a bit of something for everyone. Any time that an actor steps into the shoes of a director and makes something as wonderful as Braveheart deserves our homages. This is one to have in any serious film buffs collection.

B00003CXE7|5.0|Although I think that Russell Crowes performance was Oscar worthy, his perfect performance in A Beautiful Mind was the part that should have won him the golden guy. He was robbed! Enough about that; this film did deserve picture of the year. I saw if 3 times in the theatre alone, because it captivated me. Everytime that I watch this film I am transported in time. I feel that in the end my breath is taken away. The score is superb and one of the best ever. It helps to move you through the film from scene to scene. This is what movie making comes down to; a masterpiece in it's own right. Love it!!!!!

B000089RVX|5.0|I liked the single &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; but was skepticle about this band.  But after hearing the entire album, I have to give this a 5 star rating.  I like bands like Disturbed, Drowning Pool, Linkin Park, Rage Against the Machine, MudVayne, Flaw, Stone Sour, and a little Korn.  This album is really good.  I love the melodic songs, the mix of piano and rock, and the lead singer has very powerful vocals.  I am not a big fan of religion, Christianity, etc; but the lyrics sound more like a confused person trying to grasp the unknown rather than a gospel or sermon.  It certainly doesn't preach.
B000089RVX|4.0|This band, for those of you who don't know- should never be compared to lighter sounding Christain rock bands who are all so often inferior in talent. This is a dark, brooding gem of U.S. rock. It is similar to some other European bands such as the Italian band Lacuna Coil (also with a female and male vocalist). I am so glad that a band from the U.S. finally broke from mainstream music to produce something truly fantastic. I only buy CDs that don't have any filler tracks. This is one of those CDs where most every song is excellent. I encourage all of you to check out similar European bands such as Lacuna Coil, The Gathering and Within Temptation as well. You will thank me later.
B00005JLK1|2.0|Yeah right! It's funny how it says, people who rented Ghost Ship also rented The Ring and Signs. This movie bit all around. I couldn't wait until the whole thing was over so I could actually go in for work Monday morning! Scary movies are hard to come by these days....I've yet to find one that gave me the jolts like The Evil Dead or The Silence of the Lambs. Well, off to bed for some pleasant dreams..that should pretty much sum up how scary the movie was!
0345451325|5.0|A great book for anyone who loved the game or just likes science fiction.  For game fans it gives much more insight into what the master chief really is and who the covenant are, you will never look at the game the same way again.  For Sci-fi fans it's a great story that you can get into even if you have never played the game.  I finished it in 5 days just because every time I started to read it I couldn't put it down, even if your not a big reader you should check this book out.  Don't think that just because it's a book based on a video game that its not going to be very good, it will really surprise you. Can't wait to read the next one.
B00003CXCW|5.0|I truly knew very little of Gloria Swanson until I happened to view Sunset Boulevard. That night my fate was sealed! I was destined to begin an exaustive quest for ANYTHING to do with this Movie. I purchased some of her other movies and they were \\"quaint\\" to put it nicely. BUT as Norma Desmond...Miss Swanson became an INSTANT Legend..Perhaps the greatest of them all! The role was made for her, she had ONE SHOT at making a return, and she gave it her all! I was able to collect EVERY Autograph of all the major players in this movie and have dozens and dozens of Signed Photos and letters of Miss Swanson. This movie is the story of all human beings who were once young and beautiful (like me) and find themselves slipping into old age and a life of memories. It is the story of how one woman copes with this fact. By living in a \\"Dream World\\" she is ever young and glamorous...I am doing that as well. Norma is my idol and role model on how to survive being a Diamond in a Rhinestone World! Goodnight Norma Darling...I will love you Forever!.......Dennis

1559408758|5.0|Why was Sir Denis Eaton-Hogg knighted?  Why can't you dust for vomit?  Why must Nigel continually fold the small ryes until there is nothing left but crumbs?<br />     This superficial &quot;rockumentary&quot; (a term that is more stupid than clever) leaves many a stone(henge) unturned as it continually fails to delve deep enough.  A film that should have been portrayed as a deep psychological drama gives up and ends up playing everything for laughs.<br />     The how and why Sir Denis became knighted, could make for its own mini series on the BBC.  This question not only isn't answered, it isn't even raised!  Maybe you can't dust for vomit, but certainly DNA testing could prove whose vomit it is.  Any by examining the contents of the purged material, perhaps, something could be learned about its owner.  For example, if vegemite particles appear under the microscope, maybe the originator of the waste was Australian?  Perhaps, most disturbing is the fact that Nigel's obvious obsessive compulsive disorder, goes unrecognized and untreated.  It was so disturbing to watch him crumble the rye bread into oblivion backstage that I could barely watch.  Nigel's mental problems could have been documented by narrator Marti Dibergi in a way not seen on film since &quot;Sybil&quot;.  Instead, this scene, like many others is played for laughs.  Nigel doesn't require bigger slices of bread because he is a pampered aging has-been rocker.  He requires it because he has a disease, one that often went unrecognized and untreated in 1984.  Nigel's mental fraily is witnessed a second time in the scene where he insists that his amplifier is louder just because &quot;it goes to eleven&quot;.  Such auditory hallucinations are common in pscyotic individuals.  <br />     In summary, Tap raises more questions than it answers, and it answers very few.  DiBergi fails time and again to ask insightful questions and not surprising, receives dim witted answers.  Unfortunately Tap crumbles like a Nigel prepared Sh-t Sandwich.

0066214122|1.0|My opinion of Michael Crichton has sunk to a new low. This book reads like a sloppy first draft from someone who decided it was time to cash in on the current public and media interest in nanotechnology.<br />From a literary perspective, why would anyone care about the two-dimensional characters in this book, much less the gauzy excuse for a plot and sleep-inducing ending?<br />If viewed purely from a &quot;hard science&quot; angle, the book also fails miserably because the author couldn't be bothered to provide even a half-way plausible explanation for his nanotech swarms. Anyone with background in the physical or computer sciences will find the underpinnings for this latest variation on Shelley's Frankenstein laughable.<br />Good books from acknowledged masters of the genre feature one or more interesting ideas, are populated with fully formed, three-dimensional characters and plot elements, and furnish the reader with believable extensions to known scientific fact. This book, however, is drivel and I'm sorry I wasted money buying the hardcover edition. I expected much better from the author of the Andromeda Strain, and it will certainly be a long time before I take a chance on another Crichton book.
B00000IL1K|1.0|This was just too painful and boring... Here are my resons:   <br />Eden - This one was really good. I have no problems with this. <br />So Many Things - Bor~ing<br />Anytime, Anywhere - Great!! One of her bests.  <br />Bailero - Really BOR~ING<br />Dust In The Wind - didn't have any problems with it      <br />Il Mio Cuore Va - It was OK, but it was painful to listen to her voice hit the high notes...                <br />Un Jour Il Viendra - PAINFUL!!        <br />Nella Fantasia - It was good, but not great.        <br />Tu - TOO PAINFUL FOR MY EARS.... TOO BORING!!!       <br />Lascia Ch'io Pianga - I recommend Cecilia Bartoli's version or the one from the OST of Farinelli. Their voices are much deeper and beautiful than hers. They both brung tears to my eyes.        <br />Only An Ocean Away - My favorite song in this album        <br />Scene D'Amour - PAINFUL        <br />Nessun Dorma - Actually, I like the idea of a female singing Nessun Dorma... It's just that her voice is not fit for this song... Maybe for someone who has a strong and drammatic voice Birgit Nilsson, but... not for a weak voice like Sarah's.
B000084T18|4.0|First off, let me say that I am very hard on CDs and artists, especially when they first come out or during my first listening session.  So 50 was not treated any differently than BIG's Ready To Die or Snoop's Doggy Style.  Secondly, I weigh lyrics in more heavily than beats.  So the first time I listened to this CD, I was very judgmental and I concluded that the 50/Dre/Em combination DID NOT live up to its hype.  Almost impossible to do, initially I ignored the fascinating beats and bass lines by Dre, to really feel the content.  I felt a \\"lukewarm love\\", but then after listening to the CD a few more times and slowly turning up the volume on Dre, my rating jumped from a 2.5 to 4 stars.<br />One of the popular magazines asked the question, \\"Is 50 Cents Hip Hop's Saviour?\\"  I would not say all of that right now.  But I do think that he is a fresh face and offer a diversion to the well-documented spat between Nas & Jigga.  Furthermore, I do have to agree with several critics that are now comparing 50 to PAC.  In some sense that is true.  Just as PAC was in the Hip Hop arena for quite some time before he blew up, so goes the storyline with 50.  I remember \\"ROBBING\\" from a few years back and I thought that it was very witty but just some B-List rappers method of getting a rep.  Then the other comparisons such as the jailtime, surviving murder attempts, the male bravado thing, Dre Connection, rivalries with other rappers ...the list goes on.<br />Nevertheless, 50 is an underground rapper that has literally gone through rehab, as his 'Club' video hints at.  But to hang out with Commercial Wonders such as EM, he must waterdown his venacular of murder, mayhem, and gunplay just a little.  He is going to have a to strike a balance between being 'street enough' to allow credibility to his image but just 'safe enough' not to jeopardize his MTV, suburban fanbase.  Because let's face it, they are the gatekeepers to Platinum Status. <br />But now that 50 has teamed up with Dre who's Perfect Protege Projects include the world renowned Snoop & Em, but also includes other just-as-talented-but-not-as-celebrated, he is sure to garner enough attention to make a few MTV appearances.  I saw him on the Spring Break special the other day!  \\"In Da Club\\" is the hottest song on the CD and \\"Wanksta\\" (from the 8Mile ST) was thrown in on the tailend of the CD just because people who didn't know any better would expect it to be on this release.  21 Questions is the other only radio-friendly song on the CD and will probably be the 3rd song to receive the most radio play.  Surely this is enough to make a neophyte-hip hop fan to claim that this is a classic.  If I was to put debut albums for 50, BIG, PAC, Nas, Kane, EPMD, Slick Rick, Rakim in my CD changer, I think 50 would get the least rotation.  But rightfully so.  In the industry of Hip Hop, you gotta prove yourself over time and you have to weather a few storms.  I think 50 has put forth a good effort, and if he hangs in there he will be recognized for his contribution to the music.  However, in the meantime, he has to earn his rings.  Kobe could not be compared to Jordan until he won a couple of rings.  McGrady cannot go get the 'Heart of a Champion' from the Wizard, he must win a few Playoff series.  Thus the same path lies ahead for 50.  Let's see where we write him in history books 5 years down the line.
B00008AWOD|4.0|I have to say that I was disappointed to the album at first, I felt it was not as good as my favorite Placebo album, Without You I'm Nothing, or Black Market Music.   It started out good enough, with a nice little guitar work but then it just seemed plain.  When the album was over I was like, huh?  There didn't seem to be anything catchy or brilliant, kind of dull...  Have they pooped out after putting out three great albums (e.g. Foo Fighters, Smashing Pumpkins, etc...) ?<br />However, I listened to it a few more times and realized that there are, after all, some gems.  Picture this, The Bitter End, Plasticine, Second Sight, and a mellow Sleeping with Ghosts.  Guess I just had to sit down and listen to it a bit more.  I can say I like this album now, and would recommend it to any Placebo fan or non-fan who just wants to hear some more good Brit-rock.

0440237688|5.0|In this understated masterpiece, Lowry examines the idea that humans could entertain the possibility of giving up love, strife, choice, and all variables in life in exchange for \\"happiness\\" (really a sort of placid complacency.)  The premise seems unreasonable as the act of love is mechanized, career paths are chosen by a board of elders, and all the pain and joy and memory of society is stuffed into one overloaded brain.  The Giver must give this knowledge to the Receiver, \\"The (New) Chosen One,\\" an astute twelve-year-old boy named Jonas.  <BR>In the beginning he never questions his society because he knows no alternative, but he knows he has always been a little different than the other kids.  As soon as he is exposed to pain and love he wants to share them with others, but the Giver explains the circumstances of his society and his lonely responsibility.  Like members of today's society, Jonas and the Giver must decide whether it is right to continue compromising freedom and choice for security and \\"happiness.\\"  CLEARLY THE ANSWER IS NO!!!  Mature juveniles (a paradox?) and even adults can enjoy and learn from this novel.  Younger kids can still appreciate the good writing even if the universal concepts don't yet click.  Spread the word!
B00008DDSC|5.0|This movie provides a voyeur's view of a dominant/submissive relationship that occurs between two very disturbed individuals.  It begins simply enough and is easy to follow.  Its complexity through the middle and even to the end is altogether funny and thought-provoking.  The actors portrayed their respective roles with compelling emotion.  I was never at any time confused and I never once viewed the main characters objectively, which speaks volumes given the nature of their secret compulsion.  I rate this one 5 stars and 5 stars again--flawless.
B00003CY0V|5.0|Yes, I was a sucker (no pun intended) for that famous topless scene, but CTPB, Halle was NOT paid extra bucks to do it. It was simply a part of the character she played, as she asserts at her website. She does talk more about it in some of the supplemental trailers (including 2 hidden ones--depending on how your DVD player works you can search for titles 12 & 14). One of the trailers is as long as the movie itself; as the movie plays from start to finish, the director comments on how various scenes were shot & why they were shot the way they were. His perspective on the topless scene: Halle agreed to do it because her character would \\"get the upper hand\\" by turning the embarrassment around on Hugh Jackman's character, who would then get disoriented & bump into a chair.<br />At any rate, why all the \\"hoopla over the boobla,\\" as another reviewer put it? This is already an R movie for all the shootings & things blowing up, so its makers might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb. Besides, Kate Winslet bared all for an art-posing scene in \\"Titanic,\\" & that movie is PG-13! As long as Halle is comfy doing such a scene, I say go for it!<br />Of course there was that underwear/wire/gun scene, which I loved also. Plus the unorthodox plot where you can't tell whether Hugh Jackman is the good guy & John Travolta the bad guy or vice versa. Even the timing of this movie is interesting--it came out only a few months before 9/11.<br />Controversy often drives people's interest in a movie (or, for that matter, a book or audio CD or whatever) up instead of down, & that sure was the case with me. Congrats, Halle, on a job well done--again, if you're comfy with it, do it!
0689835604|5.0|Both of my children (now 18 months and 3) learned many body parts from this book, which encourages children to lift the flaps and search for babies' hands (under the bubbles!), toes, and even belly buttons. The illustrations are colorful and simple, which is very engaging for a 12-18 month old. I also love the focus on learning spatial relations (behind, under, etc.), and the great fine-motor skill practice that comes from lifting these oversized flaps. The flaps are as sturdy as most, but they will eventually separate from the book, o keep your wide scotch tape handy!
B00008AOS5|2.0|Red Dragon is an adaptation of the Thomas Harris serial killer novel &#34;The Red Dragon&#34;, the prequel to &#34;The Silence of the Lambs&#34;. Retired FBI profiler Will Graham (Edward Norton) is asked to return to the force to investigate the murders of two families, each killed on a full moon in exactly the same manner, before the killer can strike again. In order to find the murderer, nicknamed &#34;The Tooth Fairy&#34;, Agent Graham seeks the advice of a serial killer that he put behind bars years ago, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins). The Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes) is an admirer of Dr. Lecter as well, and is simultaneously seeking his advice. Agent Graham must decipher the evidence and Dr. Lecter's ramblings in order to crack the case before the next full moon claims the lives of another family.<br /><br />Red Dragon is the second movie adaptation of the same Thomas Harris novel. The first was a movie called Manhunter, released in 1986. So Red Dragon is in the difficult position of being compared to both a book and a movie that preceded it. I wish I could say that Red Dragon holds up well, but it doesn't. Red Dragon has but a fraction of the visual and  emotional impact that Manhunter does. It has bad screenwriting, mediocre directing, and poor casting instead. The first and most striking problem with Red Dragon is the extraordinary amount of screen time spent on things entirely extraneous to the basic plot and character development. The film really condescends to the audience by inserting several scenes that are only there to set up the next scene, as if we needed an explanation of what is going to happen before we actually see it. Presumably due to his iconic status, the character of  Hannibal Lecter is given many more scenes than the book or first movie allowed him, including a ridiculous first act that only serves to lessen our opinion of Agent Graham. Lecter's extra scenes don't contribute anything to the film except the opportunity to listen to him ramble and look at various preposterous features of the prison in which he is confined, while being distracted from the substance of the story. I found this especially annoying because I have always thought that Sir Anthony Hopkins was badly miscast as Hannibal Lecter. There are a lot more superfluous scenes in Red Dragon whose purpose I could not even guess. But all of this extraneous material prevents the film and the audience from focusing on what should be the substance of the film, and it dilutes any emotionalimpact or intellectual interest that the movie might have.<br /><br />Red Dragon's cast is certainly impressive: Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, Sir Anthony Hopkins, and in supporting roles: Philip Seymour Hoffman, Emily Watson, Mary-Louise Parker, and Harvey Keitel. I was left wondering how a film can feature so many great actors without producing one sympathetic or memorable character. I can only say by way of explanation that the characters are both badly written and badly cast. Red Dragon explores The Tooth Fairy's &#34;Red Dragon&#34; obsession in much greater depth than Manhunter does. In itself, that is neither good nor bad. But the character of The Tooth Fairy is so over-the-top and theatrical in Red Dragon that he is more ludicrous than frightening. And, again, too much screen time was dedicated to his histrionic antics. The more the audience sees of a villain, the less scary he seems, especially if we see that he is nutty to the point of caricature. In the film's worst example of poor character writing, Emily Watson plays the part of Reba, a blind woman in whom The Tooth Fairy seeks companionship. Reba is chatty, desperate, and generally annoying, not the bright and confident woman we know from both the book and the movie Manhunter. I find her character in Red Dragon to be a little insulting and certainly unsympathetic. Edward Norton's Will Graham is utterly lacking in depth and gives no indication whatsoever of the trauma that Lecter has caused him or of the great self-sacrifice that Graham is making when he decides to see Lecter again. Philip Seymour Hoffman sleepwalks through his performance. These are easily the worst performances of both of these actors' careers.<br /><br />If you liked Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal, you might like this film. But nothing in Red Dragon is believable -not the behavior of its characters or its knock-off gothic sets- so the movie is not affecting in any way. I strongly encourage you to see Manhunter, the first and far superior &#34;Red Dragon&#34; movie, and judge for yourself. Manhunter is a tightly woven film with good writing, directing, editing and casting. It is one of the best films of the serial killer genre. The characters have far greater depth. The movie has real visual impact. And Brian Cox plays Dr. Hannibal Lecter as he should be portrayed. The only reason Manhunter didn't do well at the box office is that it was released before serial killers were fashionable. Fans of Hannibal Lecter should check out Manhunter and see if you don't prefer Brian Cox's charming, seductive, and chilling Lecter to Sir Anthony Hopkins' grotesque, flippant Lecter who seems simply to be trying to put on a show all the time. I've always thought that Hopkins' Lecter was more of an attention-starved creep than a convincing criminal mastermind. If you are a fan of Thomas Harris or of murder movies, Red Dragon may be worth a rental, but Manhunter is worth owning.eat self-sacrifice that Graham is making when he decides to see Lecter again.

The Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Rickman) has murdered Robin's father and now has a tyrannical rule over the people during King Richard's absence. The Sheriff also has the evil witch Mortianna (Geraldine McEwan) on his side as he launches a campaign to put himself on the throne. Robin unites a band of exiled villagers to lead them against the Sheriff and his evil cousin, Guy of Gisborne (Michael Wincott). But with only a band of thieves and their families, can Robin be able to rid the land of evil and protect his true love, Marion Dubois (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio)? <br />*ACTING* - Kevin Costner as Robin Hood is my favorite character in the whole movie (despite complaints about his accent ;). His character was charming, funny, and was overall a great hero to root for. In the beginning he is obviously still a young man, a bit wild and not that serious. This part of Kevin Costner's acting has a lot to wish for (especially the scene where he arrives back in England). But later on as Robin begins to mature more with his responsibilities of being a leader, we see the glimpses of Costner's terrific dramatic acting abilities. Morgan Freeman gives a lot of dignity to his character of Azeem as throughout the movie he gives pieces of advise and wisdom to Robin. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Marion Dubois is well acted and she puts a good balance of strength and womanly characteristics in her acting. And then we have the Sheriff of Nottingham played by Alan Rickman. Though as an actor he is excellent, I absolutely did not like the characterization of the Sheriff! I can understand that they wanted to make the Sheriff as terrible and evil as possible, but I thinkin this movie they went a bit too far. Making him constantly shift between comical to serious resulted in only giving the movie an uneven feel. And there's one scene between the Sheriff and Marion that was highly unnecessary. Also look for Sean Connery as the good King Richard at the end of the movie. Nobody can play royalty the way Sean Connery can; he just has this way of making his characters come alive! I wish he had a bigger part in the movie.<BR> <BR>*PLOT* - The story of Robin Hood is generally well-known and as all movies go with famous legendary heroes, some changes are made to make the movie as interesting as possible. Overall I had only a few complaints with the plot: 1) I am extremely puzzled about where Prince John is throughout the movie! 2) As I said before, I was disgusted with the character of the Sheriff. 3) The character of Will Scarlet is very different and I missed the original character (my favorite in the book). The humor in the movie is distributed frequently and as often as possible. In one sense this reason is why I like the movie. But some of the humor doesn't seem to fit in with surrounding events or seriousness of the scenes, making the movie at times uneven. <br />*ACTION & SUSPENSE* - I must say that the action is one of the best points about this movie! I can almost guarantee that after watching this movie, everyone will have a favorite 'action scene'. There's the scene where Robin Hood and his men are attacked in the forest, Robin Hood's fight with Little John at the river, and ultimately, the last 20 or so minutes is extremely exciting and suspenseful! And most of all, Kevin Costner is very, very cool whenever he wields his bow and shoots off his arrows! The sword fighting of course is pretty spectacular.<br />*PG-13 RATING* - \\"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\\" is rated PG-13 for some sexual content, action/violence, and some language. The profanity is pretty tame compared to recent films but it's still there. The action and violencein the movie is not that graphic or gory but still not recommended watching with younger kids. But what really put me off was the sexual content. Some of the innuendo might have been tolerable but as I have already mentioned, the Sheriff is very weird and strange. I recommend parents watch the movie before watching with younger children.<br />*PUT-IT-ALL-TOGETHER* - Overall, \\"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\\" is an enjoyable film which has its flaws. This movie goes under my list of \\"Movies which had potential\\". \\"Robin Hood\\" would have been a much better film for me if lots of the sexual content would have been taken out. If you're a Kevin Costner film you shouldn't pass by this movie. If not a Costner fan... well, it's up to you if you want to watch this movie. But if you're looking for a good action and adventure film, check this out!<br />...
B00006HBUC|3.0|There's a lot of things wrong with this movie.  First off, it isn't a cartoon.  It's a live-action movie with a CGI Scooby Doo.  All the Scooby Doo elements are in this movie, which makes it enjoyable for fans of the show.<br />  I think Scooby Doo was a lot better as a cartoon.
0800141601|4.0|This is the heart of Camelot, not these stones, not these timbers, these palaces and towers. Burn them all and Camelot lives on, because it lives in us. Camelot is a belief that we hold in our hearts.<BR>-King Arthur<br />Prince Malagant (Ben Cross), a rebel knight from the Round Table, seeks to expand his empire and take over the lands of Guinevere (Julia Ormond). With her subjects at the mercy of Malagant's evil forces, Guinevere leaves her home to marry King Arthur (Sean Connery) and ask for his help and protection. But en route to Camelot, Guinevere's escort is ambushed and though Guinevere is almost carried away to Malagant, she is rescued by Lancelot (Richard Gere). A loner who lives by his sword, Lancelot is attracted to the soon-to-be queen, and Guinevere too feels herself drawn to him. What follows is the tale of a forbidden love which will bring about terrible consequences which might affect the outcome of the battle between good and evil.<br />*PLOT* - For those who love anything to do with Arthurian legends, this is a great film. But for those who are finicky about details, this is NOT the film for you! Besides having the legend of Arthur completely altered, none of the other famous characters besides Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinever from the stories of Arthur are present! Where's Merlin, Morgan La Fay, Mordred, Sir Galahad, Lady of the Lake, etc.? And though the Knights of the Round Table are listed in the credits (example Sir Gawaine, Sir Gareth, etc.), after watching the movie you won't be able to put names with the faces of any of the knights! This is in fact one of my biggest complaints with the movie, one of the few movies featuring the Knights of the Round Table and we're not even given a chance to know any of them! And on top of everything, the plot surrounding the romance between Lancelot and Guinevere was a bit too predictable! Lancelot starts lusting after her immediately after their meeting, and throughout the movie there's no real romance! I just felt that it was just a bit too unbelievable. Why in the world would Guinevere 'fall in love' with a man who even admits he has no real honor? <br />*ACTING* - Sean Connery is the real star of the film. With his Scottish brogue, great acting, and in general possessing the air of a king, casting Sean Connery as King Arthur was simply perfect. (a little trivia, Sean Connery also played a famous king in history when he played the uncredited role of King Richard in Kevin Costner's \\"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\\"). Whenever I finish watching \\"First Knight\\", I can't help but think Guinevere a fool to betray Arthur's love. I certainly have no complaints with Julia Ormond's acting. I thought she was marvelous, and she also has a lovely British accent which complemented her role as Guinevere. Unfortunately, as I said before, the romance didn't fall right. And Richard Gere doesn't quite fit the bill as Lancelot. Too American and too modern, and besides that, his acting wasn't top notch. Plus, I couldn't believe he was really in love with Guinevere because love requires respect. Besides not respecting Guinevere's wishes for him to leave her alone, he also doesn't respect that she is engaged to King Arthur. I also thought that the whole thing surrounding his promise that 'Guinevere will someday as him to kiss her' was stupid. <br />*ACTION* - Ah, the action is what really saves this film from being a total waste of time for movie lovers! Lots of excitement, \\"First Knight\\" is full of exuberant energy! The battles are well done, and the swordplay is loads of fun to watch! Though epic battle scenes and swordplay from the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" cannot EVER be beaten, \\"First Knight\\" is still enjoyable. Best fight is definitely the last part, especially between Lancelot and Malagant. <br />*PG-13 RATING* - The movie is rated PG-13 for violence and some innuendos. The violence is nothing too gory since the battle scenes are pretty quick. But the fight between Lancelot and Malagant might make some people a bit squeamish. The same can be said about the innuendos, though not bad at all compared to more recent films, the dialogue is obvious and suggestive at times. There is one scene though towards the beginning where parents might want to skip for younger audiences.<br />*OVERALL & RECOMMENDATIONS* - Overall, what you can expect from \\"First Knight\\" are loads of action and some nice swordplay. Unfortunately, don't expect too much to learn more about the Arthurian legends or find a beautiful and believable romance. Other movies I can recommend are:<br />-LADYHAWKE- (1985) One of the best medieval movies ever made! A wonderful tale with better action and a more beautiful love story. Director Richard Donner and starring Matthew Broderick, Rutger Hauer, and Michelle Pfeiffer. PG-13<BR>-MERLIN- (1998) TV miniseries with a stellar cast follows the life of the famous wizard, Merlin. A much more accurate look of the legend of Arthur. Director Steve Barron and starring Same Neill, Helenna Bonham Carter, Miranda Richardson, and Martin Short. NR<BR>-LOTR: FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING & THE TWO TOWERS- (2001-2002) An epic movie of grand proportions, the best battle scenes ever put on film. And when \\"The Return of the King\\" comes out in 2003, that will also be highly recommended I'm sure! Director Peter Jackson and starring Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellan, and Christopher Lee. PG-13
B00005J6UP|5.0|whats wrong with that one lady that gave it goonies a bad review.  First of all goonies is great movie and second why would you buy a movie that you had never seen not knowing the content off the movie.  sounds like another over protective parent.
0140380221|5.0|The heartwarming story Little Women is a timeless masterpiece in which Louisa May Alcott describes the lives and adventures of four sisters growing up in New England in the 1800's during the Civil War.  They are faced with many challenges they must overcome bringing them closer and closer.  Little Women brings   the trials and tribulations of young people dealing with family crises, the mending of broken hearts, and the death of a loved one.  The four sisters of the March family, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy manage to live their lives willingly, and interesting lives despite their father at war and the lack of money the family has.  The closeness bondage of the sisters intrigues you as you read through the long, but exhilarating book.  The love that the March family share is remarkable and leads to my jealousy due to the childhood I grew up without siblings.  Marmee March is the mother of the family and holds the family together. She displays infinite wisdom in dealing with her daughters and also shows unlimited patience with an exceptionally charitable nature.  Marmee also diligently teaches them the lessons they need to achieve a happiness that will carry them through their adult life.<BR>    The story of these sisters describes Meg's joys and mishaps as a young wife and mother, Jo's struggle to become a writer, Beth's tragedy, and Amy's artistic pursuits and unexpected romance.  Meg, the oldest, is somewhat vain and does not like the poverty status she has to live. She dreams of having money to spend on beautiful clothes and live like the rich society girls that have become her friends.  Jo is the second oldest, and is the tomboy growing into maturity with a quick temper. She is always quick to chastise her inner self and live the values that Marmee has taught her. Her main goal in life is to be a writer and she spends endless time pursuing this goal.  Beth is the quiet, very shy, child who is third oldest who strives to help the less fortunate in any way she can portraying herself as an angel.  Amy is the youngest, who is quite selfish and spoiled. Her desire in life is to be an artist in which she diligently looks for the beauty in the world around her to paint on canvas and dreams of painting in Paris.   Alcott portrays the characters that make them come to life as you read and the thrill you have that lures you into reading more and more. This book leads you to realize what family love is.
0312305060|5.0|To those who suffer from mortal sickness (don't we all?) <br />depicted from the last page of my favourite \\"The Hours\\" (not the movie): <br />\\"We live our lives, do whatever we do, and then we sleep - it's as simple and ordinary as that. A few jump out of windows (poor Leslie); more die by accident (US bombing), or devoured by some disease (SARS), or if we're very fortunate, by time itself. There's just this for consolation: an hour here or there when our lives seems, against all odds and expectations, to burst open and give us everything we've ever imagined, though everyone but children (and perhaps even they) knows these hours will inevitably be followed by others, far darker and more difficult. Still, we cherish the city (Sydney, Singapore, Tokyo, Melbourne, Adelaide, Hong Kong, Taipei, Kerala or even Kuala Lumpur), the morning; we hope, more than anything, for more.\\"
0743244249|2.0|This book is, quite simply, not good.  End Zone, White Noise and Underworld are all truly amazing works that show an author at the peak of his powers.  <br />Cosmopolis, like The Body Artist, smacks of an experiment gone awry.  Suprisingly for someone as iconoclastic as Delillo, he seems to have fallen into an all-too-familiar trap.  After the breakthrough success of Underworld, he has begun writing in a new style, apparently feeling like he's done all he can with his previous style.<br />I can only hope Delillo abandons this experiment soon.
B000083E79|5.0|DEFINITION OF A MUSIC ICON: CHER! There is no one quite like the divine Cher, and never will there be another. She has evolved so much during the course of her lengthy career, yet the heart of her music has remained the same. Just dance and feel good about yourself! From 'I GOT YOU BABE' all the way to last year's overlooked gems 'SONG FOR THE LONELY' and 'DIFFERENT KIND OF LOVE SONG,' Cher easily proves why she is a legend. While the mega hit 'BELIEVE' might seem to be aging (because it has been played so much), I can still listen to it and feel totally relaxed. Cher has the same philosophy about music as Kylie Minogue, Amber, and Ace of Base: Move, groove, and be free! Who needs emotional depth! Personally, I love feel good music. That is precisely why I love Cher. Her voice and the pure beauty of her music are mesmerizing. The only complaint I have about this cd is that it does not include \\"DOV'E L'AMORE\\" and \\"WALKING IN MEMPHIS.\\" What ever happens, I hope Cher doesn't stop making music for years to come.
038572179X|4.0|Have you ever been annoyed how, in literature, characters always seem to intuitively know what is going on in other people's heads?  Why can't I be so incisive?  The purpose of Atonement is to turn that notion on its ear.  In this novel, the characters think they know what's going on, but none of them are right.<br />The actual plot of the book is incidental: a little girl sees stuff and misunderstands it (or does she?).  What's interesting is that Briony (the central character) is a future author whose books will just be about how individuals perceive things differently.  Well, this is a book where everyone perceives things differently.  Motivations and actions are completely misunderstood.  We travel in and out of the different minds in the story to understand how each of them are mistaken.<br />As for the actual story, it takes place in World War II Europe.  There is a memorable description of the British retreat to Dunkirk.  It creates a very vivid picture of what England was like up to and during the war.<br />Nothing expected happens.  I groaned when I came to the bit about the note, because I thought I knew how it would pay off.  I was wrong.  There is kind of a surprise ending, which is all the more strange in a book that denies the basic principals of plot.  McEwan's elegant prose makes for a very engrossing read.
1878424114|1.0|The book is a smallish hardcover book with a little over 100 pages, all set in large type and generous spacing on smallish pages. In these pages, Deepak Chopra goes through seven \\"laws\\" of behavior and thinking that he promises, among other things, will \\"make your dreams come true\\" and bring you \\"unlimited wealth\\".<br />In reality, the \\"laws\\" are quite arbitrary and simplistic, such as being aware of what you're doing or giving to people. The text is mostly feelgood rubbish peppered with some psychological discoveries (to lend it some credibility no doubt) and quotes taken from various places that seem to support his notions, mostly from similar new age works such as A Course in Miracles, and some I think are taken out of context or made to look like they agree. He talks about \\"quantum fields\\", \\"field of pure potential\\", \\"tapping into the cosmic computer\\", and says things like \\"In the ecstacy of my own silence, and by communing with nature, I will enjoy the life throb of ages, the field of pure potentiality and unbounded creativity.\\"<br />Unsurprisingly, he has no evidence to support his claims, and the book is written with the confidence that it must be true merely because he says it is. While some of the (albeit little) psychological advice is useful, some advice I find unreasonable or potentially harmful. For example, he says that you should _always_ bring a gift when you visit someone. Another example is that the method of decision making he promotes is thinking of the choices and their consequences (this part is obvious), but then taking the one that makes you feel best and \\"plunge ahead with abandon\\". Not exactly good decision making.<br />All in all, this book is a lot of fluff with little substance, hence the title of my review. It might appeal to people whose emotional needs these sorts of promises and concepts cater to, but for lasting and substantial change without the self-delusion, look towards books based on real psychology, which do away with the hokum but instead include reasoning and research.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is one of my most favourite albums of all time.  Normally you get a couple of tracks that skip but not on this.  Can't believe that I bought this and didn't listen to the whole album for a month.  Locked into the CD play now.
B000069AUI|2.0|I don't understand these reviews? I mean after listening to this effort \\"Clock\\" is easily, I mean easily , I MEAN EASILY the stand out on this mediocure effort at best! This band sounds like they write songs just to b writing them! The lead vocalist always sounds like he is in pain. And just because he sounds like his is in pain doesn't mean he is PEOPLE! I estimate 3 more years and people will get bored with this formula. A Majority of this lp follows the same instrumentation throughout. They have the piano playin in the verses then the chorus has some middle of the road guitar work. And the subject matter he sings about is completley pointless! When I heard \\"Spies\\" I laughed, then when I heard \\"Yellow\\" I couldn't believe it. \\"I wrote this song for you it is called Yellow?  What the (...)! And the \\"Spies\\" come out the water? I don't know what this guy is SM**kin but he is on Uranus somewhere. I can't really touch anything On this latest effort it is so forgettable. \\"Trouble\\" and \\"Clock\\" are great works because of the musical arrangments. I guess I am not cool because this band just doesn't impress me all that much. I mean the \\"Chili Peppers\\" last effort was mellow and offered far more creativity than this I mean Far more. Musically and lyrically they blow this band out of the soil! What happened to people appreaciating great songs like \\"I thought You'd fall for me\\" & \\"On the low\\" by Hope Sandoval & The Warm Inventions. Or \\"Romance and Tom the Model\\" By Beth Gibbons & Rustin Man? These two bands I just named have the same empathetic sound but it is far more creatively put together. Beth & Hope's Production would send these guys retreating like a squad of caitiffs! I mean I am sorry, if Coldplay is for the complex listener, then I must be artistic! I mean \\"Sarah Mcglahlan\\" (Or how ever you spell it) delivered better grooves and sultry songs in soft rock than this!<br />Arish
0062502182|2.0|I usually pick up books on the recomendations of others, and enjoy books that offer life lessons.  Reading all of the other reviews here I thought this book was going to change my life!  I spent the $... (steep) and finished the book in about four and a half hours time.  All that I really learned from this book is that it is possible to take good teachings from the holy books of several religions, add a tenth grader story telling twist to it and....VIOLA.... instant hit!  Sorry - would only recommend to keep you occupied during a short flight, but spend your money elsewhere....
B000050IE6|5.0|This was the third Opeth album that I bought, and I think its safe to say that this one is my favorite.  Still Life is probably the best album for people new to Opeth to start with.  There are a lot more clean vocals used here than on previous efforts.  This makes it a lot more listenable for those not normally into death metal.  Speaking of the vocals, on Still Life they are done with raw emotion.  The growling is used in places where it would fit the story well. Its not just growling for the sake of growling, it has a purpose.<br />There are 2 songs on here that are all or mostly played on acoustic guitars: Benighted and Face of Melinda.  Here is the only slight complaint I have about the album, the acoustic passages seem to be quieter than they were on previous albums.  That's not to say the songs aren't great, but compared to Morningrise the acoustic guitars feel less powerful.  The bass is different as well, due to the fact that its a different bassist.  As a result, the bass isn't very promeinent.<br />With those nitpickings aside, I think I may have found one of my favorite albums of all time.  The music, the lyrics, and everything you would want in an album.  This is highly recommended for any music lover.

B00007BH5C|5.0|THE LORD OF THE RINGS is actually one massive story told in three parts. That's the way Tolkien wrote it (well, actually he divided it into six parts) and that's the way Peter Jackson filmed the movies. The soundtracks follow through on that idea.<br />THE TWO TOWERS soundtrack continues (like the movie) where THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING stopped. The music repeats some familiar and powerful selections from the first film, but it also introduces new arrangements into the mix that are just as beautiful and majestic as the songs from the first part of the series.  My favorite arrangements on the album are:<br />&quot;The King of the Golden Hall&quot;<br />&quot;Forth Eorlingas&quot;<br />&quot;Isengard Unleashed&quot;<br />&quot;Samwise the Brave&quot;<br />My favorites by far are &quot;The King of the Golden Hall&quot; and &quot;Samwise the Brave&quot;. &quot;TKotGH&quot; is a powerful, moving piece that appears throughout the soundtrack. &quot;Samwise the Brave&quot; comes near the close of Part II and incorporates all the moving and majestic emotion of this, the best scene, in the movie.  The only song on the album I didn't like is &quot;Gollum's Song&quot;. It's not the same as the song Enya sang on FELLOWSHIP and is the only piece that seems out of place.<br />This is a great album for any LORD OF THE RINGS fan or any collector of movie music.
B00000JLWW|1.0|I cannot reconcile myself to living in a world where this is the number one movie of all time.  The real sinking of the Titanic was indeed a tragedy, as was the script, the acting, and everything else about this movie.  I don't know if I've ever witnessed such horror on film before.  If someone was really as self-centered as the fiancee is supposed to be, would he continue chasing them around the boat when it's obviously sinking--wouldn't he be more interested in saving his own hide?  And I shudder at the spitting scene--there's no better way to cause a common steerage passenger to fall in love with you than to learn to spit with him.  What a trooper she was to descend to his lowly level.  Ah, it must be true love.  I'm just embarrassed for Hollywood, and for all involved in making this movie.  Especially Kate Winslet who is so much better than that.  Shame, shame, shame on James Cameron.
0316666343|5.0|This book really affected me.  I thought about it for many days after I finished reading it, which took only about 3 days because it was so absorbing.  I found Sebold's description of heaven intriguing and unlike any other I had heard of before.  Unlike some other reviewers, I thought the characters demonstrated tremendous depth and humanity- they just weren't explored more because the story wasn't about them.  Yes, the part about Susie &quot;falling to earth&quot; was fantastical, but so was the whole idea of her telling a story from heaven after she has been murdered, so you just accept it.  And somehow, in the context, it seems believable and not a departure from the rest of the story.  I was frustrated at first that her murderer kept escaping, and that she didn't use her time on earth to bring him to justice, but that would have wrapped the story up too neatly.  And it was more realistic that anyone would choose to spend time with someone they love rather than chase down a criminal, anyway.  <br />I have recommended this book to friends several times, and they have all enjoyed it.  A fascinating, thought-provoking and moving read.
B000006TRV|5.0|Perhaps the very best Rock concept album ever created in the history of mankind. This is the story of a boy who grows up to be a Rock Star who eventually goes crazy because of isolation. Roger Waters, the main composer and lyricist was inspired by the isolation he though he felt when he performed live, the distant space, the difference between the audience and the band (Pink Floyd) performing. <BR>Almost the whole story is flashbacks and memories of his past life. He remembers that his dad was killed in WWII. Then he remembers that when he was in school his teacher was very mean to him, he ridiculized him, so he wanted to rebel against him and the whole system of the school, here comes the well-known song Another brick in the Wall pt. II (this whole rebellion never took place in fact, it was just young Pink's will).  We are also told that when the teachers got home at night they were beaten and scolded by their wives (this tells us that they took revenge against the students). Then comes a description of Pinks mother.  She was way over-protective, she didnt let Pink develop by himself, as it should have been. She helped to build this Wall. A psychological wall that kept him from the others, isolated him, and kept him from having a normal life. Her mom ironically turns out to be a brick in the wall, so does the school and the teacher. The song Good-bye blue sky can be interpreted as a change in Pinks life, hes moving on (could be from his childhood to his life as a teen).  Pink knows that the wall harms him, isnt good for him, nevertheless, he feels safe behind the wall (normal behavior, it is easier for us to turn away from our fears than to face them). Then Pink tries to call his wife (in the present, his wife lives in England, he is in the US) and finds out that shed cheated on him, was with someone else. In the song young lust he is looking for a groupie to pick up. He gets himself a nice groupie/slut and takes her to his hotel whichis somewhere in LA.  In the next song he is talking to the groupie and society: he says he doesnt wanna be left and he needs them.  In the next songs he realizes, or thinks that everyone and everything in his life so far has been just bricks in the wall, meaning that it all has harmed him psychologically. <BR>The death of his father influenced his life a lot and caused an inrreversible psychological harm. In the song comfortably numb the tour manager (Pink is on the road) walks into his room and sees that his is as stoned as hell, then a doctort comes and shoots an injection into his arm to make him feel normal again. He then tells the sensation of being numb and the feelings reeled in him. He is brought back to normality and goes to perform at the concert, the song is the same as the first one (the one he performed in the other concert, at the beginning) but he starts insulting and discriminating the audience, however, they dont seem to care. The next song is part of the concert, the song waiting for the worms: the worms symbolize the decadence of Pink, his dacat, what the wall has done unto him.  In the song stop he says that hes had enough (hes still in the concert) and wants to go back to his home, take off his uniform and leave the show, but he was waiting in that prison cell (the way Pink sees the concrt or even his life) beacause he wanted to know if hed been guilty all the time. Then come the song the trial which is a psychological trial (there really is no trial, its all going on inside Pinks head) in which he judges himself, the main characters of the opera whove helped to build the wall (his mom, the teacher, his wife) are questioned and at the end the judge decides that he is guilty and sentences him to be exposed before his peers and to tear down the wall. This part is interesting, because Pinks punishment is to be taken out of the wall (the wall torn down) but this IS GOOD FOR HIM. He realizes hesbeen guilty for letting the wall be built.  In the next and last song outside the wall (whose lyrics go all alone or in twos the ones who really love you, walk up and down outside the wall. Some hand in hand, some gathered together in bands, the bleeding hearts and artists make their stand. And when theyve given you their all, some stagger and fall, after all its not easy banging your heart against some mad buggers wall.) we are told that the ones who love and care about Pink are outside the wall, which is natural, so is heSo we see that the story has turned full circle, Pink is back behind the wall again, and it is always gonna be this way, if he eventually manages to get out of the wall again, he will be back behind it. To endorse this Pink Floyd (the Band) decided to play a little bit of the music that closes the opus (it is a harmonica, I think, playing quietly in the background, right after Outside the Walls lyrics are all sung) in the very Beginning of track 1 of DISC I (In the Flesh?) and there is even a hidden message (the first part in disc II, the second part in Disc I) which says this is where we came in.  <BR>Well thats it, if youre still reading, thank you for reading cos it took me a long while to type all this babbling!
B000002BQK|4.0|It's not as compelling as MUSIC BOX or DAYDREAM -but personally i find them boring!. This CD is lyrically marvellous -but to me its not, RAINBOW would've been much better, musically it [stunk]. But i believe if you listen to MARIAH CAREY, EMOTIONS, MUSIC BOX AND DAYDREAM -without listening to her latest R&BPOP work, you'll discover she takes a journey wit this CD, she explores musically turns Hip-Hop and R&B working with Missy Elliott. <br />Honey -not the best single but ok<BR>Butterfly My All are all usually typed ballad singles. <BR>The Roof and Breakdown are new stuff, !!! -great stuff. <br />This CD has 6 ballads, and 6 Hip-Hop, Pop & R&B influenced type music songs.<br />A MUST HAVE for all Mariah fans -this is a break through!

B000002G30|4.0|Although I find &quot;Superjudge&quot; to be the best Monster Magnet release, &quot;Dopes to Infinity&quot; will always occupy a prominent place in my collection.  If you're a fan of sludgy, Sabbathesque metal, you certainly can't go wrong with this album.  Monster Magnet have always rocked unapologetically, and done so with more flair and musiciansip than any of the boring, wimpy Seattle-lite and nu-metal bands currently polluting a radio dial near you.  Dave Wyndorf's vocals are often trippy, but they still hit hard, and he and Ed Mundell pull off some excellent Iommi worship on guitars.  The first four songs on &quot;Dopes to Infinity&quot; comprise a rock clinic of sorts, from the massive, stuttering riffs of the title track and &quot;Look to Your Orb for the Warning,&quot; to the rhythmic crunch and irresistible groove of &quot;Negasonic Teenage Warhead,&quot; and the mystic trippiness of &quot;All Friends and Kingdom Come.&quot;  The quality doesn't stop there, either.  &quot;Ego, the Living Planet,&quot; is almost entirely instrumental, but its fuzzy and repetitive riffing is downright mesmerizing.  Rarely does an instrumental hold my attention like this one does.  The eight-minute &quot;Third Alternative&quot; is a swirling, sinister epic, with subdued verses building to an explosive chorus.  The fast, roaring, &quot;I Control, I Fly&quot; could almost qualify as thrash metal, and the woozy psychedelia of &quot;Vertigo&quot; closes the album out on the best note possible.  All in all, a quality album from a band that knows how to rock.  You can do a lot worse than to add &quot;Dopes to Infinity&quot; to your collection.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|I own all three of Godsmack's albums and in my opinion...this is by far the best of them all...the guitarist seems to have gotten better...of course they have a new drumer (shannon larkin) which is like the old 1 but better..and really fun to watch...sully also experiments w/ the vocals...heres my rating on each song:<br />1. straight out of line (5/5) - awesome radio-ready song<BR>2. faceless (5/5) - almost reminds me of whatever because of the repeating riffs and beats...still an awesome song...could even be single worthy<BR>3. changes (5/5) - awesome song...1 of my favorites...probably will be a single<BR>4. make me believe (5/5) - good song...nice chorus....another probable single<BR>5. i stand alone (4/5) - i gave it a 4 only cus im tired of hearing it haha..but its a really good song nevertheless<BR>6. re-align (5/5) - awesome song...another of my favorits...catchy chorus...singleworthy<BR>7. i f***in hate you (4/5) - not a bad song...could have been a little more creative w/ the lyrics but its not bad...almost a lil humorus even though its not supposed to me<BR>8. releasing the demons (3/5) - its an ok song...i really dont care for it too much...<BR>9. dead and broken (4/5) - no comment<BR>10. i am (4/5) - good chorus...dont like some certain references...i.e. \\"i am the devel's eye\\"<BR>11. the awakening (3/5) - this is an instrumental into to serenity...its mostly native drums<BR>12. serenity - (5/5) well they kept the \\"last song is a slow 1\\" tradition haha. but its actually a good song. reminds me of an accoustic voodoo...could be a single.<br />buy this cd
B00008H2LB|4.0|After waiting for this album forever, I finally got what I wanted...new songs, new lyrics and the first day at that I had a copy.  I have listened to this album through since I bought it and I'm actually glad I am reviewing it now instead of the first day when I had bought it.  Meteora is a great album but I feel it really really lacks some of the emotion that I found in Hybrid Theory that I loved...however, I do like the diverse tones in this album so it sort of weighs out.  \\"Foreward\\" seems to take from the Reanimation opening track and I think it's amazing but I think it is almost out of place.  \\"Don't Stay\\" is a good gritty song but lyrically it isn't that impressive.  \\"Somewhere I Belong\\", the current single, is lyrically an amazing song...the video is very very deep (feel free to e-mail me on the video..I'll break it down for you)...this song definately outshines many of them on Hybrid Theory lyrically and is super.  \\"Lying From You\\" has an interesting beginning but then of course the typical rapcore nu-metal feeling to it but lyrically it's good but sort of repetitious and too much like many songs on Hybrid...not a bad track by any stretch but nothing new either.  \\"Hit the Floor\\"...I love this song first of all, it's very very creative and unlike anything ever done...the beats are awesome, the rapping is tight, lyrics and chorus are amazing...top song.  \\"Easier to Run\\" is the new downbeat that actually builds even better than \\"Crawling\\" did on the debut..the drum beats are innovative and the lyrics are so much deeper and more passionate...by far, my favorite song on this album.  \\"Faint\\" is interesting at the beginning but reminds me too much of \\"Lying From You\\" so it's not as impressive as it could be.  \\"Figure 09.\\" has a great gritty guitar beginning but the rapping seems too typical now and doesn't seem to provide diversity on this album..and lyrically it's not too different from some previously recorded LP songs.  \\"Breaking the Habit\\" is the one song thatis the slowest and lowest song by LP I've heard with Chester's voice...very different but good too.  \\"From the Inside\\" is very very good with the center rap sections and the fading echo sounds in the background...another favorite on the album.  \\"Nobody's Listening\\" sort of reminds me of Japan but almost of Animi so I'll give this one credit for creativity and it's just really catch and hooks you so well.  \\"Session\\" is the new turntable mix by Mr. Hahn and I really enjoy it...must more euphoric and very good as usual.  \\"Numb\\" ends off the album..I'm not a fan of the intro but talk about penetrating lyrics and guitar rifts...this one ties for my fav song on the album and I will always like this one too for so many reasons.  Overall, Meteora has some amazing new sounds and maturity...however, there are some tracks that don't seem to stand out but since this album ranks above a 4.5 in my books and I can't give anything but whole stars, I'd love to give this a 4.75 so it'll get a 5.
0316776963|5.0|I read this on two plane rides to a conference and could not help but to laugh out loud.  I'm sure the other passengers thought I was absolutely nuts. I didn't care.<br />Sedaris' style is easy and funny to read, but harder to explain. If you haven't read some of the stories, it's extremely difficult to relay them in any decent manner.  Though too many to point out here - two that spring to mind are the ones having to do w/his sister Amy (on the Chicago L and at a photo shoot) and the explanation of Easter during a French class.<br />It's a quicker read that will make you smile (and laugh out loud) the entire way through.
0786869143|4.0|This book is an amazing book!  It changes your whole look on life.  I would strongly reccommend it to anyone because the ideas presented in it are so interesting.  I have never heard of such far-out yet possible ideas.  A great read!
B000002KO1|5.0|I first heard &quot;Brass in Pocket&quot; right around the beginning of 1980.  I thought to myself - 'man, the 80s are gonna be great when it comes to musics'.  I immediately went out and bought the Pretenders debut album.<br />The irony became that &quot;Brass in Pocket&quot; is possibly the weakest song on the recording (though I have little use for &quot;Space Invaders&quot;).<br />&quot;Precious&quot; and &quot;Mystery Achievement&quot; are possibly the best opening and closing numbers on a record ever.  Sandwiched inbetween are some wonderful, underrated recordings that rarely got played.  &quot;Lovers of Today&quot; and &quot;Private Life&quot; are much more subtle than &quot;Tattooed Love Boys&quot;, but it works.  And the almost pop of &quot;Stop Your Sobbing&quot; and &quot;Kid&quot; really fit in nicely without becoming sell-out material.<br />Everything else is just as good - though as mentioned, &quot;Brass in Pocket&quot; may have become too overplayed for me, but that's just quibbeling on my part.<br />The Pretenders have put out a lot of other good work (their 2nd and 3rd albums), but it does pain me to say - they've never matched the accomplishments of their debut disk.
B00003CXMG|5.0|Writer/director Cameron Crowe digs into his past and comes up with a rose-colored gem in Almost Famous, a touching and entertaining trip that rolls along through the wild rock scene of the 1970s. This semi-autobiographical story follows the coming-of-age of William Miller, a teenage prodigy journalist who lands an assignment for Rolling Stone magazine, and chronicles the depth of emotion that happens in a love affair with rock-and-roll.<br />Patrick Fugit plays the young protagonist, a smarter-than-his-age music geek whose sister (Zooey Deschanel) promises he'll be cool someday. Someday comes when William is taken in by the \\"band aids\\" (otherwise known as groupies) at a Black Sabbath concert and gets swept up in the circus of life on the road, despite the strong reservations of his overprotective mother (a feisty and funny Frances McDormand). Crowe distills his early experiences with the Allman Brothers Band and Led Zeppelin into Stillwater, a fictitious Midwestern band embarking on its first major tour. Guiding William by phone is Lester Bangs, the legendary Creem magazine critic who tells him \\"don't make friends with the rock stars.\\" William does of course, and in his exuberance, falls for the angelic and mysterious band aid, Penny Lane, whom Kate Hudson plays with a rapturous combination of playful passion and vulnerability.<br />William soon realizes that the music is not the only affair happening on tour. Penny Lane is enamored with Stillwater's guitarist, Russell Hammond (played with a troubling mix of charm and selfishness by Billy Crudup), and William becomes a go-between for the pair. Although the film tends to shy away from the truly darker parts of the era, the characters uncover in sweet and more personal moments the various shades of honesty and reality that are part of being an adult. It helps that the wonderfully-written dialogue also manages to avoid much of the saccharine tart that has stolen the emotional cred of some of Crowe's past movies, namelyJerry Maguire.<br />But what is most impressive about Almost Famous is the fact that none of its many characters get lost in the mix. Each is thoroughly drawn and played with gusto, from Stillwater's prickly lead singer (Jason Lee) who refers to William as \\"the Enemy,\\" to the manic and outspoken Lester Bangs, through whom Phillip Seymour Hoffman shows his seemingly unending range by countering Fugit's innocence and energy with a jaded razor wit.<BR> <BR>Finally, no review of a Cameron Crowe movie would be complete without mentioning the soundtrack. This is a movie about the 70s after all, and the music takes center-stage throughout. When the band sings along to Elton John's &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot; on their tour bus, it becomes the emotional benchmark of the film. It is also a scene that could easily be considered an attempt at coy filler in the hands of another director. But Crowe asks the audience to simply listen and experience the bond that occurs when music gets a hold of you.
0316666343|1.0|How can the reviewers be so wrong? As I read this book, I kept on saying \\"No!\\" There is nothing credible about it. And it is icky. Heaven is reading Glamour Magazine? An alcoholic grandmother is the embodiment of love? A dead girl enters another girl's body to complete her life's ambition to have sex--and she was 14 when her life ended?<BR>I wanted to retch.
0425170349|5.0|For years, Tom Clancy has been writing novels that tie into each other through certain characters.  The linking character in Rainbow Six, John Clark, is seen in previous novels such as Clear and Present Danger and Without Remorse.  John Clark is the head of a new international counter-terrorism unit designated as Rainbow.  Domingo Chavez is Clarks right hand man and son-in-law.  Clark, charged with the task of running and maintaining all aspects of this Rainbow team, has Chavez as the leader of Team-2 of two teams.  Over their first six months of operation, they respond to four seemingly unconnected incidents.  The last of these occurs at the hospital at which Clark and Chavezs wives work.  A group of PIRA terrorists (Irish-Catholic) receive inside information on Rainbow, which is supposed to be black, or secret.  They succeed in hurting Rainbow, but are all captured or killed in the process.  Unbeknownst to Clark, these incidents have been secretly planned by John Brightling, the CEO of the pharmaceuticals company Horizon Corp.  These attacks serve Brightlings purpose by getting his right hand man the security contract for the 2001 Olympics so they may carry out a world-threatening plan to end life as we know it.  From here the story takes twists and turns through the plot, always throwing in something different.  An important part of the plot, the setting takes you around the world, from a Swiss bank to the jungles of Brazil; Clancy describes each location with vivid detail and great precision.<br />Rainbow Six is a startling story of conspiracy of a large scale, covert international operations, and espionage.  Tom Clancy incorporates all of these elements into an enthralling turn of events driven by strategic switches between characters points of view that keep the story from stagnating.  All aspects of the story are adequately detailed, from the operational procedures of the British MI5 to the workings of the H&K MP10 sub-machinegun.  I highlyrecommend the suspense/action novel Rainbow Six to those that like suspense, mystery, and action compressed into one book.  For the Tom Clancy readers, this is one of his best yet.
B000066SBB|5.0|This excellent collection of hit singles amply demonstrates the major contribution the Queen of Soul made to popular music over almost forty years. On Disc One, my personal favourites include her amazing interpretation of Spanish Harlem which was a huge hit in 1971, the vocally innovative Chain Of Fools, the urgent Don't Play That Song, and the lovely lilting You're All I Need To Get By. Disc Two kicks of with her assertive Sisters Are Doing It For Themselves, the powerful duet with Annie Lennox which saw her re-establishing herself in the middle 1980s and includes the catchy Freeway Of Love from the same period. It also contains her beautiful versions of The Beatles' Let It Be and Simon &amp; Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water from the early 70s. In the sixties, Aretha's soul was more rootsy than Motown, in other words, you had to work a little bit harder to fully appreciate it, but when Disco arrived in the mid 70s, her star faded a bit since she never really had consistent commercial success in that era. But her return in the eighties saw some great music again, like the album from which Freeway Of Love was drawn. This is a comprehensive compilation of her greatest hits and always a pleasure to listen to. Not many artists have such an impressve portfolio or have consistently made such brilliant music over more than 4 decades.
B000089RVX|5.0|I first heard of EvanEscence from the DareDevil soundtrack, and since then I've been hooked. I bought the Cd 'Fallen' the day it came out, and it has not left my cd player yet. Amy's voice is so awe-inspiring, and absolutly amazing, especially in the song &quot;Imaginary&quot;. Yes, I might have to admit that the music sounds simular to Linkin Park, but not exactly...let's just say that it's a branch off the Linkin Park sound, with an addition of choir-like vocals, and of couse the Amazing Amy Lee. EvanEscence is Absolutly beautiful and should be listened to through deep thought, lyrics are very touching and emotional ( The first time I heard the song &quot;Hello&quot;...i literally cried my eyes out, and it hit very close to heart, along with most of the songs, but that song especially ) , while guitars are heavy and edgy ( Especially in the song &quot;My Last Breath&quot; ,towards the end of the song, there amazing drum lines...). Along W/ help from A Perfect Circle drummer Josh Freese, EvanEscence has [to me, at least] made a new breakthrough in music today...in short, if you don't have this cd yet...Get it NOW!!... --6r4nd0n
B000000H64|5.0|Perhaps one of the most unappreciated bands in recent metal history, \\"Demanufacture\\" stands as Fear Factory's best and most brutal album in the band's entire catalog.  Songs like \\"Zero Signal\\", \\"Replica\\", \\"New Breed\\", \\"Dog Day Sunrise\\", \\"Body Hammer\\", and \\"A Therapy For Pain\\" are among the band's best, and they fully display the vocal ranges (and almost demonic growl reminiscent of Pantera's Phil Anselmo) of Burton C. Bell, the pumping grinding riffs of Dino, the fantastic drumming of Raymond Herrera, and the unbelieveable (and underrated) bass playing of Christian Olde Wolbers.  What made Fear Factory and \\"Demanufacture\\" so great to me was the combination of old school thrash with death metal and a bit of grindcore, and although I can't say I liked the band's direction that much on later albums like \\"Obsolete\\" and \\"Digimortal\\", Fear Factory is undoubtadly one of the most underappreciated and underrated bands of the nineties.  All in all, \\"Demanufacture\\" is a spectacular album, and if your looking to get into the band start here or with \\"Soul of a New Machine\\".

B000066NW0|1.0|This album is horrible, Avril refers to it as &quot;rock&quot; but it's really pop. Not to mentions there isn't any song on the album she wrote alone, I guess she only has enough talent to &quot;co-write&quot; all 13 songs. Not to mention, &quot;Complicated, Skater Boy, and i'm with you were all written by the Matrix, and although she co-wrote her latest single with less people, it's still horrible. The music avarge, the guitar playing is avarge, she's avarge.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ALBUM. You'll listen to it 3 or 4 times and then wanna throw it out your window. People think she's so cool because she's punk, but seriouly a lot of people dress like that.
B00005JLK1|4.0|It would be a fair assessment by some to label this a garden variety horror picture but it is probably due more credit than that.  Instead of moving too fast too early so you can outguess the plot, the opening scene shows an intriguing series of events that leaves your interest piqued about what lies ahead and holds your attention.<br />Falling away from the standarad locales of haunted houses, cemetaries, etc. of other horror movies, it is nice to see a fresh perspective on an unsettling and unseemingly evil ship.  Somewhat straightforward in the cast getting killed one by one (no surprise there) with twists and turns thrown in, the viewer is thrown for a loop later in the movie that is totally unexpected and adds a nice angle to the whole story. The suspense in the movie is well done and there are good special effects to boot.  Lastly, the ending has a nice reedeming quality too in that it is not what is expected and gives you a good jolt.  So much so that you could almost read a sequel into this first movie.<br />The DVD itself has a couple of good featurettes, a music video, trailer, and cast and crew biographies.  Not a bad deal for the money really.  If you're a horror fan and like a decently developed ghost story plot with good intentions, you'll probably be pleased with this film and I do recommend it to everyone.
B00008QSAA|1.0|How thrilled I was to get Mountain's two classic albums -- Climbing and Nantucket Sleighride -- in what I assumed would be beautifully remastered editions!  How disappointed I was to discover that these cd's sound no different now than they did when they were originally issued eleven years ago!  And that sonic experience can be summed up in two words: TAPE HISS.  So much tape hiss that it's almost unbelievable. They may have repackaged these cd reissues, but it certainly does not sound as though they bothered to remaster them.  And that's too bad; these Mountain masterpieces desperately needed to be properly  restored/remastered.  Shame on Sony! This amounts to thievery.
B000001ESF|5.0|My thesis is that Rush's 2112 is their best album, and one of the best albums in both hard rock and progressive camps.Of course, this would just sound cliched if I didn't have sufficient facts to back it up. For one, Rush has some of the best musicians you will hear in popular music. This is evidenced by the 2112 Overture, which features sadistically good drumming by Neil Peart, a terrific mix of acoustic and electric guitars by Alex Lifeson, and Geddy Lee's lovable bass, all mixing with amazing effects such as echoes to create a very futuristic sounding instrumental.<BR>       Secondly, the album is a masterful fusion of graceful and hard-hitting rock. Rush has done more graceful songs than the ones on this album (Closer to the Heart, Spirit of Radio), but they never have cut an album as thrilling and heavy as this. Neil Peart has written an enduring and remarkably coherent extended track in 2112, and the band has an amazing style of alternating between sedate pieces (discovery) and explosive, blowtorching metal (The Temples of Syrinx, Presentation). Geddy Lee is in the vocal performance of his life as the main character and also as the priests, which put his vocal range to good use, as they yell larynx-shredding objections. Or would that be syrinx-shredding? Ha.<BR>      I could write a book on this album so let me say that the rest of the songs are not throwaways, and carry the same traits as the title track. In fact, the quantity of strong material makes 2112 an album that, contrary to what the skeptics say, will never be dated if people have an appetite for being dazzled by innovation, craftsmanship, and graceful rock.
B000000OQF|5.0|At the time of this album's release, you couldn't hate or like Guns 'n' Roses, because it took the better part of a year for it to spread to the masses.  Look for cameos by the band in Clint Eastwood's \\"The Dead Pool\\" which also features \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\".  The exposure must have worked, even if it was all squandered in the end.<br />Utterly lacking in originality, but nobody gave a damn; the riffs were too good, the delivery stunning, and the conviction convincing.  It contained enough glam to appeal to all the Bon Junkies as well as style for the Sonic Children.  Almost every song on this album is a classic; essential for your eighties collection (or any other for that matter), and suitable for all your air-guitaring needs.<br />If you can find it, check out their '88 show at the Ritz, which is rolling around on video somewhere--it features blistering versions of \\"Paradise City\\", \\"It's So Easy\\" and especially \\"Rocket Queen\\", my personal fave.<br />Every garage band in the world made it a point to study this album.  If Axl never releases another album, it won't matter, because this one will be around forever.
B00008H2LE|5.0|A Great CD!!! Linkin Park has done it again, and they really needed this after Reanimation, which i thought wasn't that great. The CD comes out and hits you with \\"Don't Stay\\", which is one of my favs. Then it slows down a bit with \\"Somewhere I Belong\\", which is another fav. Next, it jumps right back up into \\"Lying From You\\". After that, it gets into \\"Hit The Floor\\", which has a good beat, but it's got a little too much rap going on for me- still a decent song though. \\"Easier to Run\\" is another great song, good to just listen to. The best first 20-25 seconds of a song I have ever heard are from \\"Faint\\". It comes out with this awesome drum beat and sweet guitar. The rest of the song isn't bad, either. \\"Figure.09\\" is another one of my faves. The lyrics are sweet and they go with the music so perfectly. \\"Breaking the Habit\\" isn't a bad song, but I usually skip it, but that's just because \\"From the Inside\\" is my fav song on the whole CD. It's freakin' AWESOME!!! Chester's singing on this song is phenomenal, and it goes mixes in nicely with Mike's rapping. The next song, \\"Nobody's Listening\\", in my opinion, is the worst song on the CD. But, that's just what I think because I have a strong disliking to this kind of heavy rap. Number 12, \\"Session\\" is all instrumental. I'm not a big fan of this one because I don't like inst. music, but still a nice song, otherwise. The last song, \\"Numb\\" is a great song to end the CD with. It's not super hard, but it's got a great beat and the lyrics are great to end a bad day at school or work with. For all those buying the CD w/ DVD, the DVD is only about 40 mins long about how they made Meteora- NO music videos or live video. Great for the die-hard LP fan, but maybe not worth it to those just wanting a great CD to listen to- Just a little advice :-)
B000088E6D|3.0|There's an old, wonderfully delicious tale that's gone around for years that whilst a very young singer, trying to establish a name for herself, Barbra Streisand was appearing at a local Manhattan nightclub called the Bon Soire Club. Upon catching her act one evening a local newspaper music critic simply wrote in the following days paper, \\" Barbra Streisand, singer. File it and forget it. \\" With that in mind I must say that listening to Michael Buble's freshman disc I am sadly reminded of the critic's rather brusque remarks....and although I don't find myself in complete agreement with that harsh review I am disappointed in Mr. Buble's freshman disc. <br />But while many of Mr. Buble's fans will think me 'wrong-headed' as well I must admit to this cd being a bit of a letdown. While there's certainly little wrong in Michaels's delivery, for the most part, much of what comes across is a singer who is still seeking some direction in his career. And while kudos should go to Paul Anka ( who if I understand correctly 'discovered the younger vocalist ) unfortunately that may be part of it's downfall as well. The disc at times does have all the earmarks of a young singer being jostled into a certain Las Vegas self-styled lounge act. And for that I place the blame on Mr. Anka as well, a man who (musically speaking) seems caught in some type of ultra-lounge/Holiday Inn time warp! Add to that is production being overseen by David Foster, a man who subscribes to the theory that \\" too much is never enough \\" when producing discs for Whitney Houston or the Queen of bombast Celine Dion, and unfortunately you can see that our poor Mr. Buble never stood much of a chance. Sublty is simply not the order of the day here and most tracks are arranged, to one degree or another, as simply over the top the height of schmatlz. Not unlike Linda Eder, who sadly subscribes to the singing to 'back of the bleachers 'mentality while displaying her craft, why does it seem almost pathologically necessary to torpedo a young singers freshman disc with songs that, for the most part, are the height of kitsch and even delivered with an almost kareoke-style appeal. Do the producers feel that todays youthful music lovers ( which I guess this is who the disc is designed for ) can only be appeased with tracks that are by their very nature beat them over the head with a certain 'gooey sentimentality' that comes across as forced? And yes, once again, we have inevitable comparisons made regarding Mr. Sinatra and how this young singer reminds us just so much of a young Frank. Comparisons that I am subjected to at least two or three times a year when any young performer releases a disc of standards. Simply by virtue of using some of Mr. Sinatra's past arrangements does not a classic vocalist make. <br />Overall, if there is any issue to made with Michaels disc it is simply that in an effort to appeal too a younger audience ( and one who may not understand the intracacies in arranging an album in a subtle yet understanding manner, i.e. Nelson Riddle ) we find this young singer virtually all over the musical map ( Queen, Van Morrisona and Sinatra! ) and all the while taking each song and making them each sound like a kareoke party gone bad. And for that I place the blame on the producers of this disc not on our young singer. It would actually do Mr. Buble nicely if he did sit down and truly listen to Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald and other classic singers of that genre. If you're going to sing standards you might as well learn from the best. And although I do look forward to Mr. Buble's next disc, lets just hope he can find a producer/arranger who understands that sometimes \\" less is more. \\"
0790737345|5.0|My main reason to see this movie was Nicolas Cage - he is my favorite actor, so I was going to see the movie no matter what.  Movies are a personal experience - it all depends what you want to take away from the experience of watching them.  I personally loved this movie.<br />This movie was very touching, if you picked up on the subtle nature of what was going on.  Maggie (Meg Ryan) was struggling with her faith while being a heart surgeon who can't see the connection between her work and faith in God.  Don't let that scare you - religion isn't the main focus of the movie.  It was very moving to watch Maggie come alive once she meets Seth (Nicolas Cage) who is an angel.<br />Another reviewer had a great point - the movie, if you spend time thinking about it, really does make you realize all the little things that we all take for granted.  Dennis Franz's character really brings these things to light, but he reminded me that you don't always have to take life so seriously - there has to be room for fun and enjoyment.<br />I will admit that I was disappointed with the ending, but every movie has to end and even though I needed some Kleenex it was a very powerful ending to a though-provoking movie.  The soundtrack of this movie is also great!  The songs perfectly fit each scene.<br />The most memorable line from the movie for me is when Seth says the following to Maggie shortly after they meet for the first time:<br />\\"Some things are true whether you believe them or not.\\"
6304639457|5.0|This is the best Fleetwood Mac concert! They do the classics, &quot;Dreams&quot; &quot;The Chain&quot; &quot;Go your own way&quot; and many others. There are also some new ones including &quot;My little demon&quot; and &quot;Silver springs.&quot;<br />The advantage of having the video is that you get the whole concert. I was appalled when it on aired on MTV the first time. They cut out 40 minutes. The PBS version was an improvement, they had about 20 minutes more-but even the PBS version leaves a lot to be desired. Both the MTV and PBS versions left out &quot;I'm too afraid&quot; This song is a tour de force for Lindsey Buckingham-it showcases his incrediable talent on the guitar.<br />Get this viedo-you won't be disapointed!
B00000IAU3|5.0|I bought this CD because of the first song &quot;Here With Me&quot; which was the title song for the WB's now cancelled &quot;Roswell&quot;.  I listened to the entire CD over and over - not just the one track (which is what I normally do when I buy a CD for just one song).  I didn't much like Eminem's song &quot;Stan&quot; with &quot;Thank You&quot; as the start of the song - &quot;Thank You&quot; is so powerful standing on its own.  Dido has a very haunting quality to many of the songs on the CD - with &quot;Here With Me&quot; being my favorite on the album.  There is enough variation in the songs to make the entire CD interesting - with just enough emotion to intrigue the listener.  She has a great quality to her voice - I found it to be very pure and sultry.
0385504209|4.0|This is a good mystery with puzzles to solve, historical sights, interesting happenings and escapes, but flimsy in its basis.  Enjoyed it but couldn't take it seriously at all, almost laughable. But you might like it.
B00006F7S4|4.0|This is an excellent CD-- the songwriting is superb, and the performance is beautiful.  Not a CD to lighten the mood.
0676973779|2.0|I ordered this book with &quot;The Hours&quot; (Michael Cunningham), thinking, wow, what a great week this is going to be... Well folks, borrow this book at your local library, read the first third of the book (animals and theology stuff is great) but keep some time to do better things than reading the rest of it. The middle is boring and the end is like: &quot;where's the beef? You must be joking, etc.&quot; It's is certainly a no go for his previous or next books for me. Sorry, Yan...
B00004Y2QT|5.0|From beginning to end, this is one sweet ride.<BR>Recorded live from the purple one's studio's, we get a glimpse into what many of us have known for years: this man can funk it up and can stand on his own a guitar master.  He shares the spotlight with a littany of R&amp;B masters, new and old and gives the people what they want. I won't pick it apart, song by song.<BR>This was a truly enjoyable concert and it saddens me that I've never had the pleasure of experiencing it firsthand. One can only hope he continues pumping out the funk for many years to come, like the Godfather, James Brown

0375823360|5.0|Pullman's books are fantastic, and while they may take Milton's Paradise Lost and choose a different side to win, I think they make a good point.  <br />The story is beautifully written, with a instant immersion into a world so interesting you are immediately caught up into the story.  The plot itself is a parody of Milton's, but this time instead of emphasizing goodness as suffering, pain and misery it emphasizes goodness as tolerance, joy and love.  It is not surprising that religious fanatics have panned this book, because Pullman dissects the message of Christ away from the institutions that have brutalized it to their own advantage.  If they looked beyond his anti-clerical viewpoint they would see his message is more spiritual, and closer to pure Christianity than the chronicles of Narnia or the writings of any other author who has attempted to capture the essential Christian myths in the fantasy genre.<br />In other words, Christians who understand the message of Christ will get it and love it (many I know have).  Those who worship the walls and stones of the church will not.
B000062XM7|1.0|For a wildly romantic and daringly exciting Saturday night flick, many of the latest titles on your local movie rental locations shelves would at least lead you through an enticing story.  The Last of the Mohicans was clearly a mistake during the restocking of honest movies.  Its exaggerated sensualizations, poor cinematography, and tedious epic story line slop together into a desperate attempt to glorify James Fendimore Coopers mediocre novel.<br />     The movie opens (after a lingering scenic introduction of setting) with Nathaniel (Daniel Day-Lewis) running through the woods shirtless in hunt of wild game.  A sharp shift for Daniel from a gay street punk (My Beautiful Laundrette, 1986) to a bulked-up Indian-raised hero.  Immediately this exaggeration sickens the mood and its questionable legitimacy persists throughout the movie as Nathaniel shoots every target perfectly.  The barbaric and heroic action leaves a foul aftertaste in the mind of those expecting a qualified film.<br />     Beyond the poor appeal of the key character, the action in this action movie was apparently left out.  As a group of British travel through the woods Indians break out and a jumble of actions occur.  The battle scene omits many details, and the viewer is left watching a meaningless scramble of pandemonium irrelevant to the plot.  <br />     Ultimately, Manns The Last of the Mohicans is the example of a failure to define a true epic story.  Lacking story line, <BR>meaningless exaggerations, and poor character development stand as testament to the failure of this poorly produced picture.

B00006RU5B|4.0|On first listen, I knew Audioslave had Chris Cornell on vocals, but I was a little surprised to hear that former Rage members were in the band.  It's a big shift in tone, compared to the political rage that had been their center.  But, for the most part, this music works.  Some tunes, such as &quot;Like A Stone&quot; have a funky, bluesy jazz backdrop, with a kind of quiet power underneath.  No doubt, this is a band that can rock and it will be interesting to see their live show, but on this disc, there is art and some degree of restraint.  My major criticism has to do with consistency.  Many of the tunes on the second half just haven't clicked for me yet.  I'll give them a few more listens, then may decide to program around the ones that appeal less.  Still, plenty of great music here.
B00008H2LB|4.0|I am a big fan of Linkin Park, due to word of mouth, I went out n bought Hybrid Theory before they had much air play. I began listenin to it n it blew me away, its awesome, This is the best of both worlds(rOcK N rAp)i kept thinkin to myself. Then when Reanimation came out i was too hyped i listened to that one even more made me apperciate each song for what they are worth. I couldnt wait to hear Meteora, LP's sound is untouchable from the rest that try to follow in the rap/rock trend. They take it to a higher level, mix it all up n create a tight cd. This cd is great with a few things missing: collaborations, scratchin riffs and more tracks. I cant get enuff of LP. I love the back beat of Lyin from U , what i was lookin foward to, I dont have an actual fav of the whole cd i love em all, n for the haters, This cd is #1 on the charts for a reason, u should reconsider ur comments, n u will get hooked on METEORA. Project Revolution!
B00005Y228|5.0|I love that cd so so much when I listened to all the songs of every track on my cd player! What's really strange is that I knew it had 12 tracks but when track #12 was finished I heard the last two tracks pop up on that cd I didn't know it bonus tracks #13 and 14-in the cd it didn't say the name of the songs<BR>I did is to guess the name of the songs, I find that strange.<BR>Track #1 the song &quot;More More More&quot; is very upbeat and very very<BR>energetic because the rhythm is very discoish because it makes it feel like the 70's-it can really make you get out on the dancefloor to do disco dancing even for me too. All the other songs I can't tell how to express the beat and the rhythm in it it's very hard for me to understand because I have a learning disability. All, all the songs on that cd can really get you movin' because it can really make you sing along and dance the day away. I think Kylie is so so pretty but also she has a pretty voice.
B000089RVX|3.0|This is the rock album which anyone could ever hate. even the vedeos are undefined. i guess? but still it's entertaining.
B00003CX97|5.0|The Bridge on the River Kwai is one of those classics that never gets old.  The movie tells the story of prisoners of war forced to build a bridge for their Japanese captors. However the British commanding officer will have none of this and instantly puts up a fight.  Later the movie follows the prisoners efforts at building the bridge as well as the story involving Allied commandoes who are attempting to destroy the bridge.  <br /> This classic is full of great performances that should not be missed.  Alec Guinness, who won an Academy Award for his role, plays Colonel Nicholson, the stubborn British officer.  His conflict with Colonel Saito(Sessue Hayakawa) provides much of the plot for the first hour of the movie.  William Holden is Shears, a man who escapes from the prison camp only to return with Force 316 as they try to destroy the bridge.  Jack Hawkins gives another good role as Warden, the team leader, who will do anything to complete the mission.  Also worthwhile is Geoffrey Horne as Joyce, the youngest member of the team.  This is not one of those action packed fliks that is so prevalent today.  The movie is really more of a character study than anything else.<BR> <BR> The limited edition DVD is perfect and should not be missed by any fans of this classic.  The documentary on the making of the movie is very good.  There is also a widescreen presentation with many other worthwhile extras.  If nothing else, at least watch the last twenty minutes of the movie.  It is one of the most tense scenes in movie history.  You can just feel the anxiety as the end draws near.  Do Not Miss This Classic!
B00005B74X|5.0|Although at the time this was originally issued, I had a couple of reservations, now I realize how great this album is. It captures the ambiance of a certain time and place in musical and cultural history like no other, except, perhaps, Quicksilver's first album. A glorious evocation of the hard musical edge of the hippy era.
0066214122|2.0|In Prey, Michael Crichton does it again: merges action with techno-zeitgeist by bringing nanotechnology into his familiar world of brainy, regular-Joe heroes; a supporting cast of death-ready, 2-dimensional characters; and bad guys so obvious they might as well be twirling Snidely Whiplash moustaches as they violate the boundaries of nature.<br />It's my firm conviction that, by now, Crichton-- a very smart, very tall man, with lots of connections and money-- has created his very own, personalized Novel Writing Machine full of evolutionary algorithms and whatnot such that, when he gets an idea (and he almost always has A+ ideas) he can shoot an outline and a few key concepts into his NWM and set it to cook for, oh, a week.  In the meantime, he sells the movie rights and adjusts characters according to producers' casting concerns.<br />Which is my smart... way of saying this book, like many of his others, has a great \\"hook\\" to use a music industry term and one that continues to rook me in, despite the knowledge that I will be forced to read as one stock character after another (or, in Prey, the main character) describes in giant blocks of exposition how it is the science works.  And, you know, all these tiny robots are cool but I could read Engines of Creation by Eric Drexler and care more about the characters... and it's non-fiction.<br />I would recommend Prey only to those who know what they're getting into, and to speed-readers with a long airplane ride ahead of them.  Or to those with the constitution to become emotionally involved in soap opera plots and people.
B00005O3VC|5.0|For those who don't \\"get\\" the humor in this movie, it may seem like a 90 minute detour into one of the outer circles of hell.  Actors playing multiple roles, idiots smacking coconut shells together to make horse-sounds, men playing most of the female roles, modern-day police tracking medieval knights, the use of the word \\"nee\\" to a huge extent and lots of blood gouting from gory wounds.  For those people, I can only have pity.<br />Because to love HOLY GRAIL is to establish a life-long friendship.  I've never known anyone who was lukewarm about the film.  Hate it (see above) and you just scratch your head in wonder at its popularity.  Love it,and you find yourself quoting it often and watching it over and over.  My family and I watch this movie at least once a year.  When my son (now 15) first watched this movie with me, I knew it was an important moment in our relationship.  Would he think his dad was weird for recommending this old British piece of junk?  Or would he join the club of fanatics?  Let's just say that we now own almost everything by Monty Python that is available on DVD and we're saving up for FAWLTY TOWERS.  For him, it was the Dark Knight's duel with King Arthur that first made him a believer.<br />I won't rehash the plot...that probably isn't possible.  But suffice it to say that I don't think anyone should skip this movie.  Yes, you might hate it.  If so, I'm sorry.  But there's a good chance you'll be sucked in and then you too can quote \\"It's only a flesh wound\\" or \\"Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberry\\" or \\"There are those who call me...Tim.\\"  And you can enjoy, again and again, the vicious attacks of the white rabbit.  (If you have the DVD, I challenge you to watch the rabbit attack on super-slow motion...it's a historian's study on great film editing and it's also gut-bustingly funny!)  You can learn to count to five...uh, three.  You can learn to insult like the French.  And on and on.  <br />The deluxe DVD set comeswith a 2nd disc full of extras.  Not much of it is indispensible, but it's certainly worth the extra few bucks.  There is a complete redo of the CAMELOT song, except done entirely with legos which makes the 2nd disc worthwhile right there.
6304143184|5.0|My review of E.T.<BR>I really do think that this is one of the most classic children and adult movies of all time. I will never forget the first time I saw it and how moving it was. I believe that the creator hit an alien right on the mark. Let's always believe that we can have special friends.
B000001ESN|5.0|This album was Rush's first major foray into wide-spread, popular success.  And now, 25 years later, SPIRIT OF THE RADIO, FREEWILL and even JACOB'S LADDER still get frequent airplay, and not just on \\"classic rock\\" stations.<br />My only gripe about the album is its brevity.  Six songs over about 40 minutes...but then I remind myself that they didn't have CD's back then, so a shorter album today was a \\"regular\\" length album back then.<br />Every song is a winner on this album, but in my opinion, the true gem for Rush fans is NATURAL SCIENCE.  It's structured like one of their 20 minute, full-side songs (2112 being the most famous example), but it is compacted into a 9 minute package.  Lyrically, it is quite clever, particulary early on, when lyricist Neil Peart draws an analogy between the little communities of life that live in tide pools and our own lives.  As he says \\"living in our pools, we soon forget about the sea.\\"  Musically, the song was very quiet and almost acoustic up till that moment.  Then the guitar begins to build, as the \\"sea\\" comes in.  The song goes off in several directions throughout, yet the sum effect is of unity, as the piece deals with different aspects of science and man's relation thereto.<br />Rush still does this piece in concert.  It's sweeping in the best sense of the word, and a true high point in their career.<br />This is not to neglect the radio classics FREEWILL (what a guitar solo!!!  And the lyrics pretty much lay out Peart's philosophy, which he returns to again and again in albums to come, but seldom so clearly) and SPIRIT OF THE RADIO (one of the greatest rock songs ever...it celebrates music and the power of radio).  These songs remain in the pantheon of hard rock greats for a good reason.  <br />This is a must own for Rush fans, both fanatical and more casual.  \\"Begin the day with a friendly voice, a companion unobtrusive.\\"  What a great line...what a great album!!!
B00007H1Y2|3.0|The critics got me all worked up on this release. So I jumped at it. I have not yet felt buyer's remorse, but the music ain't as wild as I thought it'd be. Don't get me wrong. I dig Ry Cooder mightily. And this is among the better of his excursions in Cuba. Just be wary of the hype and enjoy it on its own merits.
0887306667|2.0|The basic principles in this book may or may not be valid. It's hard to tell, because most of the examples given are no longer valid. So much time is spent on IBM and computers in general, and we all know how much has changed in those areas in the last 8 years. The authors couldn't predict how things would go. They grossly underestimated the popularity of the PC and gave virtually no credit to Microsoft as a company that would be viable in the future. They touted Lotus 1-2-3 and were skeptical that &quot;office suites&quot; would ever catch on. (Microsoft Office, anyone?). I think the book is interesting from a historical perspective, but could be dangerous to apply to business today.
0743424425|5.0|This is the first novel of King work that I read.  I had first seen the Kubrick movie and I was scared to death.  I had to read the book.  I was surprised at the differences.  As I got further along in the story, I felt I was inside the minds of these three characters.  The dillusions, the voices, the ghosts, the masks.  When I completed this novel, I was still thinking about it for hours after.  What struck me as the most frightening was that somthing like this COULD happen!  Not the SHINING that Danny possessed, of course, but the mental breakdown of this man, stuck in a huge hotel for months with no one but his wife and young son.  The mind is a powerful force.  It can make you believe things that aren't real.  You'll hear things that aren't there to be heard.  You'll see things that aren't there to be seen.  King goes into a lot of reality with this book, and the mind can be the scariest monster of all.  I HIGHLY recommend this novel as a first KING read.
B000002C4J|4.0|After the massive success of FALLING INTO YOU, the world was ready for Celine's next release. This 1997 album was released to massive success, having sold 30 million copies worldwide, 10 million in the US alone. Besides containing the monstrous hit &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;, the album also contained the AC #1 &quot;To Love You More&quot;, the international smash duet with Barbra Streisand, &quot;Tell Him&quot;, the European and Australian hit &quot;Immortality&quot; and the minor European hit &quot;Treat Her Like A Lady&quot;.<br />1. The Reason (4.5): Written by Carole King and produced by Sir George Martin, this rock-sounding ballad gives Celine a chance to show off those glorious vocal cords. She just overdoes it a bit here.<br />2. Immortality (5): This lovely ballad written and produced by the Bee Gees is a perfect showcase for Celine's lower register, and it's great to listen to.<br />3. Treat Her Like A Lady (4): Celine Dion tries hip-hop!? Unbelievable! Even more unbelievable is that she pulls it off! Written by Diana King and produced by Ric Wake, this is a catchy track and a change of pace for Celine.<br />4. Why O Why (2): My least favorite song on the album. I don't like it.<br />5. Love Is On The Way (4.5): Another lovely ballad, this was first covered by Billy Porter from THE FIRST WIVES CLUB soundtrack.<br />6. Tell Him (5): When two of the great female voices of the century came together for this lush ballad, the result has to be explosive. Hearing Celine and Barbra sing is marvelous.<br />7. Where Is The Love (4.5): This Corey Hart-penned track is one of Celine's more unique songs, as she stays in her lower register and is not about love, but instead the state of the world.<br />8. When I Need You (4.5): A cover of Leo Sayer's 1977 hit, Celine does nicely with this one.<br />9. Miles To Go (Before I Sleep) (5) : The second Corey Hart-penned track, this mid-tempo ballad is great, with Celine showing off her vocal range once again.<br />10. Us (5): A ballad of longing and frustration, Celine turns in an emotional performance here.<br />11. Just A Little Bit of Love (4): The album's best up-tempo track, this one can lift your spirits nicely (not to be confused with the almost identical song on CELINE DION).<br />12. My Heart Will Go On (4): Celine's biggest hit? An emotional, powerful ballad that went perfectly with TITANIC? The winner of an Oscar, four Grammys and a Golden Globe? Check, check and check. Worthy of all the attention and playing it got? Ummmmm, I'd have to say no. While this is one of her classics, she HAS done better songs, and it completely burned out at radio.<br />13. I Hate You Then I Love You (3.5): Celine stretches into opera with this duet with the one and only Pavarotti. The song comes off as nice, but not a direction Celine should take completely.<br />14. To Love You More (5): One of Celine's very best songs, this huge Japanese hit and #1 AC hit is the best on this album. The violin is great and Celine turns in a jaw-dropping vocal performance.<br />15. Let's Talk About Love (5): One of the album's highlights, this Beatles-esque song is a testament to the power of love, and a perfect to the album for US fans.<br />Bonus Tracks: Be The Man (4.5): A bonus track from the Asian Version of LTAL, this is the sequel to &quot;To Love You More&quot;, not as good, but it's still a great song.<br />Bottom Line: A must-get if you are a Celine fan./>10.

0451169514|4.0|One of King's longer novels, I was both impressed, yet confused with this story of childhood fears manifesting themselves into a reality of death.  I enjoyed the flashbacks to the \\"gang's\\" childhood memories, yet King mixed the memories up too much.  The jumping from one character's life to another's, then back to the previous character was confusing.  It was hard to keep the facts straight in my mind.  I will admit, Pennywise \\"IT\\", is the most horrifying monster King has cooked up.  He made the amusing notion that, \\"All kids love clowns,\\" when in fact it's the opposite.  Most kids, whom I've talked to, are terrified of clowns, or any creature in costume.  They appear so huge before their eyes and they are frightened.  There's something not trustworthy about that forever smile on those faces.  I loved the book up until the end.  I was disgusted [by what the boys did to that girl.] That was unneccessary!
0064407667|1.0|the bad beginning (a series of unfortunate events, book 1) is depressing, boring,and creepy. this story has no story line and plot. all it is is a bunch of \\"unfortunate events\\" rolled into one! the characters (sunny,klaus, violet, count olef, jusstice struass ect.) are all one deminsional and extreamly hard to relate (if a person could relate to them at all). the author is very clear that the book is not a happy one, and right he was! this book contains no happy events whatsoever. the book starts out with the bauldaire kids spending a day at briny beach where they then find out their parents have died in a fire from a guy named mr. poe, go to live at his house for one night, and then go to live with their uncle count olef who is adopting them. count olef is an evil man who out to steal the kids fortune that their parents left them. sound interesting? well...it's not. by the end of the book count olef plans on stealing the bauldair children's fortune along with marrying voilet. the count also abuses the children horriably. this book is not okay for the age group that it is pointing at (9-12) year olds. also, the author explains words every other sentence, which gets extreamly annoying. you would think that the words explained here, 9-12 year olds would already know...but acording to the author of this book they don't. i've read many good books in my life, and this is not one of them. this is one of the worst i've ever read. i got a headache from reading it. to all those people who said this book was good...what is wrong with you? this is horriable! also, what kind of pen name is lemony snikket?

B00005JLEU|5.0|\\"Spirited Away\\" is a movie showing the power of love and sometimes the trials we endure to achieve true love.  The adventure of Chichiro in the land of the spirits builds her self confidence and independence.  This is an excellent movie that teaches many lessons for childern and adults alike.
B00008H2LE|5.0|Linkin Park just keeps getting better.  This CD is the best yet. I just can't stop listening!
B00008GKEG|5.0|As an avid Beatle fanatic, I replaced my laserdisc box set with the DVD box.  Despite some minor pixelization, the program material betters the laserdisc image (plus you get additional content).  But the REAL reason to get this set for the real Beatle fan is to get REAL 5.1 sound.  To hear a terrific surround mix of Penny Lane &amp; Strawberry Fields sends the heart fluttering...they sound FABULOUS.  Discrete sounds from all the channels.  Even the earlier recordings sound great with the natural echo coming from the rear.  This really whets my appetite for the rumored DVD-Audio titles that are supposedly in the works.  At any rate, this is a first rate documentary and should be in any music lover's collection.
B000002JBG|5.0|I love all the songs on here and my favorites are 11 and 14. 14 is like the song for everyone to get into and it get when you are cleaning the house to listen to. It an cd that you need it your collection today so go and buy the cd then after that go buy the movie.<br />Maybe you will buy the movie first and then get the soundtrack either way you should buy both because it's a great cd to listen to and you will want to play it over again.
B00008AY3L|5.0|Ben Harper is the greatest. Beautiful...Album is Very unique (of course). Buy it. The man has style.
B000083E79|5.0|Okay, it is the greatest of the greatest hits from any artist, but it lacks! That is, it lacks some hits. Like Love & Understanding, We All Sleep Alone, All I Ever Need Is You, The Way of Love, You Better Sit Down Kids, Wasn't It Good (granted, it only peaked in the 50s on the Billboard Hot 100, but so did One By One, which is included), also, the CD lacks bonus material. But hey! That would make the CD over 30 tracks.<br />However, die hard Cher fan or not, if you like the HITS of Cher, this is the CD. At least 2 hit songs from every decade for the past five decades... now how many artists can claim to have hits for five decades! Only Her Majesty! All the songs here on this CD, ranging from the #1 smash \\"Believe\\" (which went number 1 in 23 different countries, a record itself) to If I Could Turn Back Time to Take Me Home to Gypsies, Tramps, and Theives to All I Really Wanna Do to I Got You Babe to her latest smash dance singles (This Is)A Song For The Lonely and Different Kind Of Love Song, both recent number 1 dance tracks! Thus far, this is the GREATEST greatest hits not only for Cher, but for any artist. Let's just hope next we get a Not-So-Greatest Hits collection, or a Rare Cher Collection, or even a box set for Cher's 1970s albums, including \\"Stars\\", recorded on Warners.
B000002H2H|5.0|If you're a metal fan and haven't heard this, you're missing out on an important milestone in the genre.  Songs like \\"Fade To Black\\" (one of the band's finest works ever) and \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\" will go down as metal classics.  The instrumental \\"Call of Ktulu\\" illustrates this superior band's ability to produce quality music without the aid of vocals.  Even though it's only four and a half minutes long, \\"Escape\\" is one of my personal favorites.  Honestly, there is not a single weak track on Ride The Lightning.  This is one album nobody should be without.
B00008GKEG|4.0|I've been eagerly awaiting this DVD release for quite a few years now, and sadly I must report that this collection is rather disappointing.  I look through all these glowing reviews and feel as if I've gotten the wrong edition but alas that isn't the case.  The full length documentary is here in fantastic digital quality yet why did they make the contents of the set so thin?  DVD special editions and releases of classic films are usually filled to brim with extras yet this isn't the case.  The extra disc contains mainly footage dealing with the putting together of the Anthology and the recording of &quot;Free As A Bird&quot; and &quot;Real Love&quot;.  The video for &quot;Real Love&quot; is included yet some how not the same is done for &quot;Free As A Bird&quot; yet puzzling enough it does include a short bit about the making of latter's video.  Why one but not the other?  With all of the footage cramed into the documentary in edited form, would it been too much to put some extra clips on each disc?  Instead we get two episoded per disc with each disc tracking in at about two and a half hours each.  That's a lot of wasted space on each disc and it just calls attention to how thin this set is of features.  Just check out &quot;A Hard Days Night&quot; to se a Beatle's set done right.<br />One big problem I encountered is the wildly fluctuating sound levels.  If you remaster the sound but don't normalize them, well then you've only done half of the job.  Watch the Anthology with your remote in your hand because you'll be turn the sound levels up and down faily regularly.<br />Another disappointment is the lack of any materials in the jewel cases listing tracks, and why aren't songs given chaptermarks now that I think of it.  Argh, it really gets under my skin that this DVD set has fallen short of the mark.  Look at how well the CDs from this series came out and then the book as and maybe you'll understand my point.  As much as I love this documentary, they just didn't take full advantage of the technology available to them.  This is the type of monumental release that requires...no make that demands special treatment and in this case it just didn't happen.t take full advantage of the technology available to them.  This is the type of monumental release that requires...no make that demands special treatment and in this case it just didn't happen.
031286504X|3.0|a good book. no, nothing more. perhaps even a bit worse. a plague makes everyone either dead or vampires. except one. who tries to survive. who tries to kill vampires. he locks himself up safe and sound in his house. this is actually the great thing in the book. the descriptions of the way the guy stands there watching the vampires trying to lure him out or attack the house. very W.H.Hodgson- like. but except for that. i mean, why bother killing the vampires if you're the only one left? and how important are we supposed to feel his survival is, when he's the only human left. he lives, he dies. mankind's done for either way. survival isn't even important for him, since he feels lonely, scared, etc. let him die, i say. who cares when it doesn't make a difference? this is actually more a story about loneliness than a horror novel to me.
B00008AY3L|5.0|As my non catchy title states this album is very good. It's good to see Ben with a new release out. It has been almost 4 years since his last studio release. I can say that the wait was definitely worth it. Ben makes his usual genre jumps all over the record. Its amazing how he (and the IC's) are able to pull this off. So anyway I'll give a brief description of the songs.<br />With My Own Two Hands - First single, reggae, reminds me of one of Ben's influences Bob Marley overall 8/10<br />When its good - acoustic bluesy type song, very good tune. Ben busts out the acoustic slide on this one. 10/10<br />Diamonds On The Inside - great song, remind me of Elvis Costello. 10/10<br />Touch From Your Lust - Nice effects on the guitar, got the Leslie (listen to Hendrix's Angel) effect going, straight foreward rock tune. 8/10<br />When She Believes - Slow ballad type song, strings used, acoustic guitar - pretty good tune 9/10<br />Brown Eyed Blues - The first funky sounding track on the album, pretty cool little bass line to this one. Nice little Bass solo on this also. I love this song. 10/10<br />Bring The Funk - This is an all out funk track, but I don't really like it to much. 6/10<br />Everything - another acoustic type song (has bass and percussion in it), bluesy feel to it, uplifting though - 8/10<br />Amen Omen - my favorite song on the album. Well crafted acoustic song. Best song Ben has written in a long time. 15/10<br />Temporary Remedy - straight ahead rock song. I think it needs to grow on me. 6/10<br />So High So Low - This is the Led Zep song of the album. Gonna be a great live song. 10/10<br />Blessed to be A Witness - Ben's voice is the highlight of this song. Mellow song. Beautiful. 10/10<br />Picture of Jesus - Acapella type song, just percussion and vocals. Good song but I'm not really feeling it. 7/10<br />She's Only Happy in the Sun - Ender of the album, is kind on weak to end the album on. I'm sure it'll grow on me. 6/10<br />If you like singer/songwriters at least check Ben out. If you've never heard Ben before buy &quot;Life From Mars&quot; the double live set. First half electric, second half solo acoustic.<br />Peace.
B0000039PW|5.0|OK, how do I start this....I think this a good CD....as a matter this is the best cd ever to be created. Biggie's lyrics are crazy. His beats are sick.

B00008J4P5|5.0|This is easily the best White Stripes album yet. In fact this is one of the best albums I've heard recorded during my life time. I instantly fell in love with this CD as soon as I heard Seven Nation Army start things off. And my love grew with every single song that followed. The first three albums by the White Stripes were all amazing but this one proves exactly how talented they truely are. Elephant has quickly reached its way into my TOP 10 ALL-TIME favorite albums list.  This is their first album that rocks straight through to the end, even though there are a couple slow songs in the middle. Their previous CDs all contained at least 1 or 2 songs that could easily be skipped over. But Elephant shows just how solid Jack's writing is becoming.<br />I have not stopped listening to this CD since I bought it when the stores opened on the the release date, and I don't see it growing old any time soon. I know this one is brand new but I can't help but dream of what they will pull off in their next album. \\"Ball and Biscuit\\" immediately became one of my All-Time favorite guitar songs, on the list with \\"Stairway...\\", \\"November Rain\\", \\"Comfortably Numb\\", and \\"Voodoo Child\\".<br />If you don't have this one yet, buy it immediately and go throw out your Creed, Staind, Nickleback, Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Puddle of Mudd and any other .... albums you have been tricked into purchasing over the past few years.<br />AC/DC said \\"Rock and Roll ain't noise pollution / Rock and Roll ain't gonna die!\\" Jack and Meg are making sure that stands true! And so should you!
B00004Z459|3.0|I'll keep this short &amp; sweet.  There are about 5 very good songs on here, but the rest sounds like it was thrown together.  Add that to the fact that it takes up less than half of an 80-minute-capable CD, and you suddenly feel like you wasted your money.  The high-profile stuff (&quot;One Step Closer,&quot; &quot;In The End,&quot; &quot;Crawling,&quot; &quot;Papercut&quot;) is the best.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|There are good films, even great films...and then there are those in which all the elements come together to form something so close to perfection, something that so exemplifies what can be enriching, artistic and just flat out entertaining about the medium that you can only sit back in wonder and let it flow over you like a pleasant, soothing bath.  &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; is such a film.  The cinematography, music, script, acting -- there are few films that come close to matching the skill with which &quot;Mildred..&quot; has been put together.  There's not a moment, a line or a look that rings false; not a frame that doesn't speak of the craft of Hollywood at its peak.  But not in a self-conscious way.  In fact, this is the least campy of Hollywood's melodramas, even with Miss Joan Crawford in the lead.  Few actresses have deserved their Oscar more.  The sensitivity and understatement she brings to the role is mighty impressive, particularly in light of the scenery chewing and self-parody to which she could so often fall prey.  If you're at all interested in Hollywood's golden years and you don't know &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; -- well, you really can't be a Hollywood connoisseur without it in your collection.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I don't quite understand or agree a few user's reviews of this movie. I saw it with my 6 year old daughter, who I never take to anything rated stronger than PG. I think this movie teaches kids such wonderful lessons in humanity, and you need to understand the meaning behind the movie yourself before you can judge it. It might be a little confusing to the lesser educated? My daughter loved it, and we used it as an important lesson about morals. You will never see her eat food left sitting on a counter!! My husband and I also loved the movie. Don't be afraid to let your kids see this movie, it's certainly better than the .... afternoon cartoons they watch on t.v. Although I don't care for anime, this was a REALLY good movie, we have already pre-ordered it for dvd. Put the popcorn in the microwave sit down with the family and enjoy! If they have any nightmares you can blame me, but frankly my daughter has more nightmares after watching teletubbies! So do I!!
B0000029GA|5.0|Illmatic was ONE of the best rap albums ever to come out. He had MCs scared to death. he was killin' em' softly. He changed the game. Ever song is a classic. all you need is a hot beat and tight lyrics to make a hot album...nas shows it on this one. If you want to by an album go cop this one, it wont dissapoint you
B000002I6T|5.0|I can't rave on about this recording any more or any better than those before me. If you've never heard it, wait no longer. If you have, you know.<br />My only complaint is that this masterpiece STILL hasn't been remastered. If ever an album deserved it, this one does.
B000002HRE|3.0|I've noticed a lot of hate for this album from other Metallica fans.  If you're dedicated to the 1980s Metallica, prepare for a disappointment.  If you're a little more open-minded, this might find favor with you.  I have to admit, there are plenty of weak spots, but hands down, &quot;The Unforgiven II&quot; is a GREAT song.  I like it slightly better than the first (the mood is more demonic and the story line finds slightly more favor in my sadistic mind).  Otherwise, this is one where I'll listen to the first minute or so of some of the songs, but then find myself skipping tracks.
015670160X|4.0|very good story, incredible themes.. took a little long to get into..
1400034779|5.0|This is a wonderful little book with engaging, memorable characters.  Mma Ramotswe is a down to earth, unapologetically real woman doing what she wants to do instead of what people expect of her.  Yes, this book is about a detective agency. Yes, there are concrete mysteries for her to solve, but I think the real beauty in this book lay in the larger mysteries, the mysteries we all face in life that Mma Ramotswe so eloquently voices.  As Mma Ramotswe says:<br />\\"How sorry she felt for white people...who were always dashing around and worrying themselves over things that were going to happen anyway.  What was the use of having all that money if you could never sit still...?  None, in her view; none at all, and yet they didn't know it.  Every so often you meet a white person who understood, who realized how things really were; but these people were few and far between and the other white people often treated them with suspicion.\\"<br />I think this sums it up pretty well!
0780631684|1.0|My sister dragged me to see this awful movie when it first came out, telling me how good it would be and how it was going to be as scary, if not scarier than \\"Scream\\". Yeah right. Maybe if you're a 12-year old Slaughter fan who's never seen anything more adult than \\"Lilo And Stitch\\" it would be scary. The long and short of it is a stupid, spoiled rich (I think he was rich...shows how much I paid attention to this stinker) brat who goes to Paris with his equally useless, boring and bratty friends and sees their deaths or something like that. I wouldn't know anything else about it because it was such a turkey that Butterball could cut it up and sell it as lunch meat and that's probably the reason both my sister and I fell asleep partway through it. I give this floating log of a movie 1 star only because it can't go any lower! I want my [$$]back!! Avoid this at all costs!
B000077VPU|3.0|The DVD quality is very good, but the bad thing is that you only get the half of the concert. There is the second part, after Liz Taylor speech, and you miss the Metallica, Guns and Roses, Extremme, Deff Lepard and other groups that opened that concert.<br />If you want the full concert, this is not the DVD you looking for.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Boy plays guitar. Boy meets girl. Girl learns drums. Boy and girl form band.  The condensed history of the White Stripes would go something like this, but what would be missing from such an oversimplified summary-despite how attached The White Stripes are to simplicity-is how good they really are.  The <BR>fact that this random two-piece garage band from Detroit formed by Jack and Meg White opened up for the Rolling Stones and has been hailed by critics ever since they arrived on the scene is enough to prove their worthiness of a second listen, but their new release Elephant proves more than that.  It proves their <BR>greatness.   <BR>    The album surpasses expectations because it rocks out more than ever.  It also contains many of the same blues and folk songwriting techniques found on their past albums.  British alt rocker Holly Golightly even has a guest spot on  \\"It's True That We Love One Another\\", a song that revisits the Stripes' affinity for childlike melodies that project an innocent, jovial vibe onto the album (also see:  \\"I Want To Be The Boy\\". \\"You've Got Her In Your Pocket\\"). <BR>     If it wasn't clear before that Jack's guitar fluency makes up for Meg's lack of drumming skill (in fact, it sometimes seems that Jack put drum sticks in her hand and told her to tap every two seconds), then it is now.  Jack White's voice, sometimes screechy, sometimes sugary, but always song-appropriate, has only gotten better.   In the same tradition as the Kim Deal sung Pixies radio hits, \\"In the cold, cold, night\\" features Meg White on vocals in a jazz lounge-y tune.  With the timidity of a mouse, Meg cautiously approaches each note but the overall impact is reminiscent of a mystery-novel play on \\"You Give Me <BR>Fever\\". <BR>   The White Stripe trademark of unadulterated rock n' roll continues throughout this album.  If the songs seem more complicated, they aren't.  They even choose to practice their magic without the aid of modern technology.  The booklet in their album states, \\"No computers were used during the writing, recording, mixing, or mastering of this record.\\"  The album was recorded in an old British studio that stocks no post-1963 music technology.  As a result, the album is rough around the edges, but it is that roughness that is definitively <BR>White Stripe material.  Altogether, Elephant is a colorful smattering of songwriting that comes across more complicated than written and more original than intended; it's just so smart. <BR>   Perhaps the best component of this album is Jack's weakness for edgy guitar solos, which were absent on past releases The White Stripes and White Blood Cells.  Jack's solos turn \\"Black Math\\" from a punky blues jaunt into a fireball of flawless rock rhythm.  In the bluesy break-up piece \\"Ball and Biscuit\\", Jack <BR>uses his guitar solo to go where his words cannot.  His adlibs \\"Yeah, I think I got one or two things to say about, listen\\" head start a glorious mess of screaming whammies and whining scales.   <BR>   The genius of De Stijl, the Stripes' second album, with the catchy, saccharine goodness of songs such as \\"Apple Blossom\\" still exists today, but Jack has learned a thing or two about songwriting since.  The more mature Elephant piece \\"Seven Nation Army\\" exhibits the same schoolboy charm from Detroit days, but the raw fury and vulnerability in the vocals and alluring bass-infused guitar preamble tempting enough to bring Eve out of the garden. Using the quiet-loud-quiet songwriting pioneered by Nirvana and a magnetic chorus, \\"Seven Nation Army\\" builds a momentum so intoxicating we forget the band is contemporary.  Likewise, \\"There's No Home For You Here\\" has a grown-up <BR>gospel hymn quality that rests nicely on with the Mudhoney-like grunge distortion at the middle of the song.  Jack uses tempo as a weapon in this song with his \\"Throwing garbage/Drinking soda/Looking happy/Taking pictures/So completely stupid/Just go away\\" rampage that unleashes an angry despair onto the repeated refrain that is the song's title. <BR>     The White Stripes' identification with the original emotion and musical composition Burt Bacharach put into \\"I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself\\" is what makes the only cover on the album work.  The flamenco-whirl of the song perfectly compliments Jack's tiptoeing into the higher octaves of his vocal range and enables him to switch from metal god to opera primadonna and back again inside of a measure. <BR>    The time has come when The White Stripes regime must resist inclusion in the \\"The Insert--Word(s)-Here\\"s bands like The Hives and The Strokes of today's popular rock genres, and the sweaty-palm inducing, eye-opening Elephant shows exactly why, with its unfussy drumming and domineering guitar.  After listening to this album, the thought of rock n' roll's future in Jack and Meg White's hands leaves one sprawled with morning-after glee.
B000002J20|3.0|Probably the album that causes the greatest disagreement between Yes members and Yes fans.<br />There are parts of this album, comprised of four songs, averaged 20 minutes each, that work. And thats just to my ears, it may not be for everyone's. I know that after listening to Remembering (High The Memory) there is one particular section that I look forward to, and then I stop the song once its done. I cannot say I honestly do that with other Yes albums (apart from Going For The One / Tormato and The Ladder when I've listened to it.)I've owned this album for over 20 years, and my opinion has rarely changed about it.<br />For a person who is interested in what Yes does within a 20 minute timesphere, then this probably is the album for you. At times, it does show a brilliance that is rarely seen in bands aimed at a youth culture. Extended pieces and themes, orchestral movements and bombast, intricate playing and rhythms. It honestly is an album that can be appreciated on a level by musicians (in particular) and those who truly just love music of many kinds. It is not for everyone, and I would say if you're just starting out with Yes, Tales From Topographic Oceans is not where you want to start.<br />Instead go to the previous album, 1972's Close To The Edge, to find out where Yes were trying to go with their craft. Close to the Edge definitely inspired Tales's lofty ambitions, but its content is far more simplified, and therefore works more cohesively track to track, song to song, theme within theme. The songs on Close to the Edge build and extend melodies presented within the work. In sections that seem entirely unrelated, a melody from a previous section will return played over an entirely different rhythm. That is how classical works, and how Yes worked, and when they did it well it was every bit as good.<br />On Tales, it doesn't quite work as well. Wakeman's disinterest in the whole project shows throughout the album, where his keyboard role is much diminished, and sometimes non-existent. He had been a major force in Yes music up until this album, and his presence is definitely in the background throughout. This album is primarily Anderson & Howe's show, and it excels in places because of it, but sorely lacks as well. A main problem being Anderson's lyrics and the basis of the entire 'concept'. He basically tried to lyrically encapsulate Paramhansa Yogananda's 'Autobiography of a Yogi'. A very lofty ideal to shoot for, and it was Wakeman's problem with Topographic from the beginning. How are you to interpret an entire book of life-philosophy after a 7 hour jam session with Howe. Wakeman thought the idea to be half-baked. I tend to agree with him, merely because of Anderson's penchant of being 'spiritual' but being purposefully vague and incomprehensible in execution. Some find that spiritual, but if anyone has ever read Yogananda's book, its not as difficult to follow as Anderson's interpretation. At times I feel Anderson never knows what he's talking about.<br />For me, there's just not enough execution throughout, and much meandering on a note or a chord for sake of extending the piece. I'm a Yes fan, I do not mind 20 minute songs, when they work they are great and the time goes by quickly when you are thoroughly immersed in what is going on. That doesn't happen as much on Tales. Sections just go on and on, and you get the feeling they didn't know when to stop, so they just kept going.<br />As a live piece, 'Ritual' works much better. There is a version of this on DVD of Yes at Q.P.R (1975) that far outshines the original studio recording, and I find Ritual to be the one song that I think works and keeps you within it for the longest time. As I said before Remembering has one section in it that I particularly enjoy, primarily for Squire & White's interplay.<br />An acquired taste, but I feel the album before this 'Close To The Edge' and the album after (with Patrick Moraz) 'Relayer' are far better examples of Yes writing extended pieces and making them work extraordinarily well.extended pieces and making them work extraordinarily well.
B00004U2EZ|5.0|The first time I saw the musical, I fell in love with it instantly. The performances are so powerful and well sung.  Bruno Pelletier has a beautiful clear voice that could be listened to over and over again. I especially adore his song Le Temps des Cathedrals.  Daniel Lavoie is perfectly suited for the role of Frollo - I can find no flaws in his performance.  Patrick Fiori sings his songs wonderfully and his voice range is fantastic.  Garou is magnificent in his role as Quasimodo. His voice is low and husky - perfect for the hunchback. He expresses Quasimodo's pain and despair so very well. (Dieu Que Le Monde Est Injuste and Danse Mon Esmeralda always bring me close to tears)  Noa is superb as Esmeralda. Helene Segara, who plays Esmeralda in the musical, sometimes has trouble reaching the high notes especially in her duets with Quasimodo (which aren't on this CD)  Julie Zenatti has a very sweet, clear voice. Her only song on this CD is La Monture, which she sings beautifully.  Luck Mervil is very passionate in his role as Clopin. I'm not a huge fan of his voice but he plays the part well.  I have not been able to find any musical as beautiful as this one. I recommend EVERYONE to purchase this, even if you don't speak French.
B0000640VO|5.0|i first saw this movie with my boyfriend. its a great movie if you're in the mood to see a cute romantic movie. you cant help but like amelie and other other characters in the movie, no matter how weird they are. its all in french so if you dont mind subtitles, its alright. its a very artistic film as well. they use lots of rich colors and computer animation to help the film along. very good movie. i'd recommend it to anyone.
0446677450|5.0|This is a great book.  It really made me think about how I use money.  This book has great information for anyone, but would also be very useful for the entrepreneur who is attempting to learn how to use his/her money to successfully build his/her business.   Definitely recommend.
0844663662|5.0|Vonnegut's writing has always defied traditional classification and Slaughterhouse-Five is a prime example of this as it combines a mix of social satire, science fiction, anti-war sentiment as well as great deal of autobiographical detail. The full title-page of Slaughterhouse Five is perhaps the most revealing and apt description of the book in addition to giving us some insight into the author's mind-set behind its creation. <br />Slaughterhouse-Five or The Children's Crusade - A Duty-Dance with Death By Kurt Vonnegut <BR>A fourth-generation German-American now living in easy circumstances on Cape Cod [and smoking too much], who, as an American Infantry Scout Hors De Combat, As a prisoner of war, witnessed the fire-bombing of Dresden, Germany, \\"The Florence of the Elbe,\\" a long time ago, and survived to tell the tale. This is a novel somewhat in the telegraphic schizophrenic manner of tales of the planet Tralfamadore, where the flying saucers come from. <BR> <BR>Billy Pilgrim's \\"telegraphic schizophrenic\\" shifts from one period of his life to another is his own defence mechanism in dealing with (or avoiding dealing with) the traumatic experiences in his life. Vonnegut has acknowledged that the only way in which he could tell his story of surviving the fire-bombing of Dresden was in this fragmented manner and that it refused to come out as a linear story when he attempted to tell it as such. <br />What is amazing to me about Slaughterhouse Five is that Vonnegut manages to fit so much into one story. While writing a brilliant satire on the absurdity of war on par with Joseph Heller's Catch-22, Vonnegut also manages to put a human face on the tragedy at Dresden and expose one of World War II's darker moments to the general public in an accessible form. <br />While the fragmented nature of time in the novel is largely a thematic device used by Vonnegut to contrast the different events in Billy Pilgrim's life, Vonnegut also contemplates the nature of time and fate in the book. <br />After Billy meets with the Tralfamadorian's and they explain the nature of time from their own perception, Billy is able to accept his wanderings in time. Having visited his own death on numerous times he is no longer frightened by it and has come to accept it. With regard to fate, Vonnegut seems to argue that life is easier to live if we, like Billy Pilgrim accept that what will happen has already happened and that we are not in control of our own destiny. This absence of responsibility for our actions could in itself spark an entirely separate philosophical and religious debate that I don't intend to entertain in the space provided here. Suffice it to say that it's an interesting proposition and one that can be seen as a recurring theme in time travel literature. <br />With regard to time travel and the nature of time my argument of late has been that if the past is immutable and cannot be changed by the time traveller, then it tends to suggest that fate exists. My logic being that assuming time is linear (which it may not be), our present is the future's past so if we can't change our past the future cannot change its own past (our present). Confused yet? Anyhow, its just an aside that I thought I would mention in light of the themes raised in Slaughterhouse Five.
B000089J0R|4.0|Out of the ashes of Dragonheart comes the phoenix of London's Dragonforce. This debut CD is actually better than I thought it would be (having seen them in 2000 opening for Stratovarius in London... I knew there was something special about them though) delivering a fresh ensemble of power metal with a kind of speed metal influence. The deuling guitarists Herman Li and Sam Totman provide some awesome shred at times and the arrangements are sound, with Li providing some absolutely breathtaking solos! Vocalist ZP Thearst reminds me of a cross between perhaps Bobby Blitz of Overkill and Micheal Kiske of Helloween, his style definitely fits their brand of metal! Highlights include: &quot;Valley of the Damned&quot; (excellent title track), &quot;Black Winter Night&quot; (awesome tune with killer guitars, the best!), &quot;Starfire&quot; (great 80s sounding ballad), &quot;Disciples of Babylon&quot; (some proggy elements here), &quot;Revelations&quot; and &quot;Evening Star&quot;. The music is somewhat of a mix between the old school power influence of Maiden/Helloween and the speed metal sound of Infernal Majesty/Overkill. This is a breath of fresh air after some monumental disappointments from some of the so-called heavy hitters of the genre. Get this and feel the fire power of the night warriors!
B00008GKEG|5.0|Well, what can I say? <BR>This is an amazing collection of anecdotes, stories, clips, and historical info told by the Beatles themselves. It is an amazing series which blows my mind. <BR> I'm literally speechless. This has to be one of the best DVDs ever made. <BR> LONG LIVE THE BEATLES!
0684800713|3.0|Hemingway is a fantastic writer, however his plotting leaves much to be desired in this story of an impotent (in more ways than one) man who drifts through life as though he has no purpose.<BR>I absolutely hate the end of the book, where Brett tells him that if he wasn't impotent \\"we could've had a hell of a good time.\\"  <br />I do mark the book as 3 stars however, because Hemingway's use of language is so powerful.  The plot is absolutely useless.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This CD really rocks my world! It's terrific, you all have to buy it. You won't regret I promise. It is a really powerful lytics and great music style. Who would think russian music is so great. I'm beginning to be interested in russian culture overall, I think it's a very rich culture and the CD and the girls (TATU) prove it. The music is just AMAIZING!Way way way better than what we have on US market now.
B00005JKBC|5.0|Spy Game was a superb movie that will keep you guessing until the end. With the intrigue and the wonderful plot of going backwards showed the two worst places the United States has involved itself in, Beirut and Vietnam. The soundtrack to this movie also keeps the viewer on edge with its combination of fast paced action music and some music from the area, for example stringed intruments with China and deep wood instruments for beirut. The casting was also superb not only with Pitt and Redford but the CIA executives along with other minor characters was very well performed. This movie is just a plain great movie that everyone should watch. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes the James Bond series, Tom Clancy movies, and any movie about war.

B00003CXXI|5.0|Clever and sweet -- but never cloying -- and completely original. A film to treasure, with the message that only true love can allow you to understand what beauty is. My preschool-aged kids adore this movie, and so do I. A well-delivered moral about the pain caused by prejudice. Get the soundtrack, too, you'll listen to the wonderful music over and over and sing along!
B000063DFS|5.0|Ozzy it's a metal master, for me, many friends and many Ozzy's fans, this is the MOST IMPORTANT ALBUM FROM OZZY!!!<br />First, all the album are incredible, \\"I don't Want to change the World\\" it's one of my favorites songs (Ozzy won a Grammy Award for this one) an \\"Desire\\", \\"No more tears\\", \\"Hellraiser\\", \\"S.I.N\\", \\"Road to nowhere\\" sounds incredible. Lemmy (Motorhead's frontman) and Zakk composed some songs with Ozzy and all of them are a METAL MONSTERS!!!<br />Buy it, enjoy it and you will know what this word (METAL) means.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Okay I didn't even like Chirstina until \\"Come On Over\\" came out, and I continued to like her music released from then on. Well I didn't see pictures of her (talk about Dirrrrty) but when I did hear the first single off of this album \\"Dirrty\\" (basicly a remake of a redman song but works...) I loved it! It was brash, it was edgy, it was everything pop wasn't supposed to be! It was like we got a new Madonna from the \\"Erotica\\" period, I loved it. So anyway I bought this album and listened to it expecting something a la \\"Britney\\" (her 3rd album) but I was blown away by what I heard. Every song on here was fantastic, Christina has a voice and it's a good one. Now this rarelly happens that I love every song on an album... especially a predominatly pop album but I just couldn't help but love this one. You have ... tracks \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" and possibly \\"Dirrty,\\" and then you have insprational tracks \\"Soar\\" \\"Cruz\\" \\"The Voice Within\\" \\"I'm OK\\" \\"Keep on Singin My Song.\\" The ballads are perfect: \\"Beautiful\\" \\"Loving Me 4 Me.\\" There is not one bad song on here... I love it!

B00005MP58|5.0|I have wanted Mister Darcy ever since my first reading of Jane Austen's brilliant classic. And at last he is mine, all mine, courtesy of this spectacular BBC/A&amp;E dramatization.<br />Colin Firth is, as readers of &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot; well know, the perfect Mister Darcy. In fact, he IS Mister Darcy...his haughty looks, his handsome face, his lordly bearing...his very subtly exposed vulnerability when he looks at Elizabeth Bennett. Jennifer Ehle, with her fresh English looks and her captivating face, is a charming Elizabeth. In fact, the casting contributes in no small way to the brilliance of this feature. From the smallest character to the leads, everyone is as I imagined them to be from my many, many readings of the book.<br />Add to this the lush photography, the perfect period detail (furniture, clothing, countryside, village, even the militia's red coats) and you simply swoon with pleasure. As one of the filmmakers remarks in the special feature: &quot;Every time I read the book, I hold my breath hoping that Elizabeth and Mister Darcy wind up together, even though I KNOW they do.&quot; Exactly. And it is the same with the film--some parts, where each haughtily insults the other--actually make the viewer nervous. Will they REALLY wind up together? Or has the DVD morphed in the night and it won't happen?<br />Happily, all is well. The short extras on casting, the making of the film and such are mildly interesting...not really a spectacular addition to the film itself. In fact, I wish I had not seen the stunt that ends up on film with Mister Darcy diving into the lake. It took something away from the fantasy of the film. Nevertheless, I treasure this DVD almost as much as my own worn copy of the book.
B00008J2DQ|3.0|It was hard to distinguish Godsmack songs with two album, now it's even harder with a third album that sounds exactly like the first two. That's not necessarily a bad thing, Godsmack has a pretty powerful sound. It's just that Faceless doesn't have any songs that will pass the test of time. The first album had Voodoo (which I will never get tired of) and the second album had Awake (best Godsmack song in my opinion). Sure, Faceless has Straight out of Line and I Stand Alone, but they don't really stand out among the rest.<br />So what does this album do if it doesn't take Godsmack to a new level ? Well, it does the job. This is Godsmack like they were before and they don't disappoint from that point of view. If you liked the first two albums, you'll like this one. If you like the new single, Straight out of Line, there's no reason why you shouldn't like Faceless. If you didn't care for this band before, you won't start now. That's about all there is to it.
B00006690G|1.0|this is Eminem's 3rd album and it's the same as the first two. Nothing has changed in the way he releases music now: happy upbeat song, depressing song, then if we are lucky you get a third single... but this album just wears thin after about 2 listens.

B000084T18|5.0|WOW! This is a GREAT CD! I must admit I bought it because of the hit \\"In Da Club\\" so I decided to just buy it and it was worth every single penny.<br />1. Intro<BR>2. What Up Gangsta (9/10)- It's really catchy and stays in your head for a while. I love the beat and it's what I call \\"true rap\\".<BR>3. Patiently Waiting (10/10)- I love this song. And I love Eminem. Eminem helped in writing this song and he hasnt lost his touch!<BR>4. Many Men (Wish Death)(10/10)- Nice beats. It's basically just 50 saying hes glad to be alive. I would too after being hit 9 times gettin stabbed and going through all the crap hes been through!<BR>5. In Da Club (10/10)- Ah yes. One of my favorites. I could replay this over and over and over and not get tired of it. I love the beat and the words.<BR>6. High All The Time (8/10)- It's not my favorite but still good. I think he could have done better but once you play it a couple time it gets better.<BR>7. Heat (9/10)- I like how they got the beat to work with the gun shots and everything. <BR>8. If I Can't (10/10)- The beat is cool and I can really jam in my car to this one!<BR>9. Blood Hound (10/10)- This reminds me of old school rap. The ghetto rap!<BR>10. Back Down (9/10)- I have the sudden urge to yell \\"G-UNIT!\\" Good lyrics and beat.<BR>11. P.I.M.P (10/10)- LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this song. I love the beat and the lyrics.<BR>12. Like My Style (10/10)- 50 cent is funny.. hes really boastful. I like it though.<BR>13. Poor Lil Rich (9/10)- I could do without the word nigga every few seconds but other than that its really good.<BR>14. 21 Questions (10/10)- Oh my God. This HAS to be the next single.

Gotta Make It To Heaven (10/10)- Hell yeah for goin through hell! haha. A real good song.<BR>BONUS CUTS:<BR>17. Wanksta (10/10)- This song when it first came outwas stuck in my head for 2 weeks. I kept singing it and singing it and I annoyed people. I love this song.<BR>18. You Not Like Me (10/10)- It reminds me of that new Nick Cannon song \\"Your Pops Dont Like Me\\" or whatever it's called but its still good.<BR>19. Lifes On The Line (9/10)- I like the beats and everything. Another great song.
B00008URYM|5.0|Okay this song is a bit of a big leap for Madonna. It's brilliant, it's fun, it's fantastic and it has one of the best videos I've ever seen (too bad the general public won't get to see it). This song fuses &quot;Music&quot; with &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; with &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot; only it's better then that! I suggest that you get this single and check it out.

0375751513|5.0|\\"What does it profit a man if he gains the world, but loses his soul?\\"  This is the core question raised by \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", Oscar Wilde's reworking (if that isn't too unkind) of Goethe's Faust for the Victorian era and his attack on the values of the middle classes caused a scandal when it was first published in 1890 and over 100 years later, while not particularly shocking to the modern reader is still a deeply unsettling tale. The novel revolves around our hero Dorian, the tensions within his own character and the forces that conspire in his eventual destruction.<br />The book begins with Dorian seeing for the first time a portrait of himself painted by his friend Basil Hallward and Dorian's wish that the portrait would age while he remained forever the same as he was on that day.  The \\"prayer of his pride\\" is answered and not only does the picture carry the assault of time for Dorian, but also the full weight of the casual cruelties and crimes he commits, evolving from a reproduction of his physical form into a mirror image of his soul.  Realising this, Dorian is driven to even greater excesses safe in the knowledge that he can get away with it until finally his own guilt catches up with him.<br />In his only novel, one can't help but feel that Oscar is giving us an insight into his own soul and the guilt he suffered over his sexual orientation.  But on a deeper level, Wilde shows us the damnation of one soul and in that gives us a metaphor for our world and ourselves.  Despite the Victorian idea that a persons nature is written on their face, which is frankly ludicrous with the hindsight of the last century, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a truly wonderful and thought-provoking story heavily laced with the famous wit and wisdom of the great man himself.
B000069HK2|5.0|No band has ever written lyrics that came such close to things I experienced in my life. If I only remembered all the times I played a Box Full of Sharp Objects...... It's amazing how this band manages to create a great balance between screaming and melody. Mosts bands in this category have trouble with making one good track, this band has at least five of them.... The weaker pieces on the album are quickly forgiven, for good songs like Maybe Memories, Bulimic and The Taste of Ink make this album one to never forget...
B00008MNYS|5.0|It blows my mind that after 5 years of phenominal success worldwide, Robbie Williams is still a relative unknown in North America. That should change with Escapology, but not because it differs from his earlier albums (which are of just as high quality) but because he dropped the company that used to market him in the U.S. and is now under the label Virgin, who should know how to market him properly. Afterall, they were the ones who brought the Spice Girls to the U.S. (not that there is any comparison in the quality of music)<BR>Anyways, the album is a gem. There is not one song to skip, yiu can just press play and listen for an hour. The most powerful songs on the album are the ones which Robbie bares his soul, like leads single &quot;Feel&quot; and my favorite song on the album, &quot;Come Undone&quot;. But there are also some fun songs such as &quot;Me and My Monkey&quot; and &quot;Get a little High&quot;. No matter what your flavor, there is sure to be something that reflects your taste on this album. Robbie deserves the success he is about to get Stateside, and he'll also be touring here in the fall, so look out for that!
B00008J2DQ|4.0|Opening this album are various sounds from a battle - machine guns spewing out volleys of bullets, soldier voices, and a helicopter flying (very much like Metallica's classic song \\"One\\") - and then the real song starts up, with the drums echoing the chopper blades. \\"Straight Out of Line\\" is an instant classic and the war sounds introduce it well. Then for the rest of the 47 minutes Godsmack blows you away with heavy bass lines, pounding drums (from new drummer Shannon Larkin) and great swirling guitar riffs. After that a menacing guitar riff opens up another classic - the title track \\"Faceless\\" <BR>\\"Changes\\" is another great song, with an extended guitar part and an extended classic Sully scream. \\"I Stand Alone\\" is my personal favorite on the album, ever since it came out on The Scorpion King Soundtrack i have enjoyed it. Most of the other songs are usual Godsmack songs reminding me of a lot of the 2nd disc and slightly of the 1st. Excluding \\"I F***ing Hate You\\" (revealed by the title) there arent many obscenities this time around. Especially welcome tracks are the intro \\"The Awakening\\" and the song \\"Serenity\\" which are classic Godsmack concluding tracks (\\"Voodoo\\" on the 1st album and \\"The Journey\\"/\\"Spiral\\" on the 2nd) that leave us on a good, soft note.<BR>All in all another great CD from Godsmack
B0000636UN|5.0|This is an awsome album! From the opening track, 'Steve McQueen' and throughout the songs, Crow manages to sound as though she is having fun again. There is the other side, in which she shows that bad things happen, but she is managing to walk away. I think this is one of the best albums I have bought this year, second behind Springsteen's 'The Rising'

B00006CXSS|1.0|This is not a good war movie and the reviews here doesnt change that simply by the fact that americans dont know what war is. America hasnt experienced war on its soil affecting civillians. To americans war is a sport where you send some men to a far off country to fight. The review by the swede is therefore correct, BOB is just another american war movie. Too the person who said that critics of this movie should get their facts right: The Panther and Tiger tanks were ww2's best tanks, tank for tank, and their crews were superior to anything that the allies could muster. You claim that the T series was the best tank, the problem is that all russian tanks have T in their name. It ranges from the T-26 tanks to todays T-90. I put the blame on this lack of knowledge on your part to the american school system which doesnt learn american children anything about the world outside the US. <br />The movie is good for one thing namely glorification of the soldiers who took part in it. In most cases this is well earned but in some cases for example concerning Lt. Speirs it is simply shamefull. Only in america could a war criminal like this be hailed as a war hero. There are also a lot of triggerhappy americans and in this case the movie depicts the realities of american troops in war very accurate. A european quote from ww2 sums everything up:\\"When the British planes attacked, the Germans took cover. When the German planes attacked, the Allies took cover. When the American planes attacked everyone took cover...\\" <br />If you like movies depicting the realities of war without american \\"mush\\" and patriotism a movie like \\"Talvisota\\" or \\"Stalingrad\\" would be better. These films depict suffering on an unimaginable scale that is virtually unknown to any american soldier or civilian.

0441172717|5.0|By far, dune is one of the best science - fiction novels ever written. This book gives me a stronger view, and a better felling on science fiction. Auther Frank Herbert does such a great job on actually making every effert for detail, to make it feel like you are there. The many story lines happening at the same time really keep you into the book, but this can also lose you in the book too. Overall, I give dune 5 stars. It has to be one of the best novels ever written.
B00005N83M|1.0|Why is it that the people with the least talent are the ones we have to hear from the most?  She can't sing, she can't act, and her clothes are horrible (not to mention poorly made!)

0441172717|5.0|BY far Dune is one of the best science fiction novels ever written. This book gave me a stronger view, and a better perception on understanding science fiction. Many story lines that run at the same time through out the story really keep you into the book, but many readers can get lost through out the book in between story lines. Overall I give dune a five star reading! Dune is the best science fiction novel I have ever read and I definatedly recommened this book for anyone who likes to read. It is spectacular.<br />Dune is based in a galaxy far away much like most science fiction novels of it's time. A boy named paul has caught word that he may be the Kwisatz haderach. He has to travel through out the planet Arakis and train his followers to defeat the emporer and the Harkoneons, the defeaters of his father. I will not reveal the end of the story so I don't spoil the reading.

B000089CJI|4.0|Postal Service: Give Up (Sub Pop Records).<br /> Admit it. You've got a copy of that Justin Timberlake solo album hidden in your dresser, between the mattresses, or under your bed. You get it out when you're all alone and strap on the headphones and let that syrupy, saccharine white man electroni-soul ooze into your ears like so much cola that's sat in the sun for too long. You give yourself all you can take before you rip the headphones violently off of your head and fling them across the room before collapsing into a grotesque, nauseated heap, all the while repeating the mantra, \\"never again, never again...\\" But what's worse is the guilt, oh the guilt this shameless activity dumps on an ordinarily self-respecting music appreciator like yourself. The hairshirt, the ice-cold baths--you'd think you'd learn. But you don't. Within two days you're back swimming in the Timberlake (it's made of Kool-Aid) and it's the whole ordeal all over again.<BR> Hey, I know. You want your pop, you want to shake it--and we all do. It's a human weakness. This is why Give Up, the debut album from the collaboration known as the Postal Service is such a revelation for kids like you and me. Yes, it's guilt be gone! Throw that Timberlake in the--well, you know. See, the Postal Service combines all the good elements of electronica, indie-rock and good old schlocky pop to make what is for the most part warm, ingratiating, intelligent music, guaranteed not to leave you too sticky. The Postal Service are Dntel's Jimmy Tamborello and Death Cab for Cutie's Benjamin Gibbard, who come from their seemingly unrelated musical poles and meet wonderfully in the middle. The collaboration was originally conceived as a one-time project for a song on the debut album from electronic act Dntel. The result was the sublime \\"The Dream of Evan & Chan,\\" a song that left people clamoring for more. During the months that ensued, Tamborello and Gibbard worked independently on the project, with each completing a part or idea and mailing it to the other (hence, the name). <BR> Tamborello, of course, took care of the musical programming while Gibbard contributed lyrics and vocals. Fans of Death Cab for Cutie will instantly recognize Gibbard's boyish croon, although the setting here is anything but indie-rock. Instead, contemporary comparisons can be made to recent groundbreakers in the electroni-pop marriage like the Notwist or the Magnetic Fields, with roots traceable to Low Life-era New Order and the Human League. Gibbard has in fact said that one song in particular on Give Up (\\"Nothing Better\\") was inspired by the Human League's \\"Don't You Want Me.\\" The result is a back and forth that's as old as anything: the guy begging for another chance to make it right like he knows he can and the girl (here played by indie songstress Jen Wood) replying with a cool denial. The result isn't Shakespeare, but it strikes  a certain something (she: \\"so please back away and let me go...\\" he: \\"I can't my darling, I love you so...\\").  <BR> Elsewhere finds Rilo Kiley's Jenny Lewis contributing background vocals that serve as the perfect match for Gibbard, most notably on the dense but undeniable \\"We Will Become Silhouettes.\\" Lyrically, Gibbard turns in the kind of romantic, idealistic numbers that would sound corny over his regular rock & roll  gig. He's a veritable Lord Byron on songs like \\"Brand New Colony,\\" \\"Clark Gable,\\" and the designated single \\"Such Great Heights.\\" On paper, a line like: \\"I am thinking it's a sign/ that the freckles in our eyes are mirror images/ and when we kiss they're perfectly aligned...\\" sounds as cheeky as anything you'll get from J. Tim or J. Lo. Maybe it's the earnest delivery, maybe it's Tamborello's complex beats, but it actually works and eventually leads into  what is easily one of the sublime chorus melodies of the year.<BR> Give Up is by no means a perfect album, but it's certainly already achieved elevated status as far as collaborations go. What's more, no more sneaking around like a hormone-charged teen in the night to get your pop fix. No more hiding and guilt and shame. Give Up is an album you'll be proud to display on your living room coffee table, not to mention your stereo speakers.<br />Pure electroni-pop confection that lets you forego the Pepto Bismol.   8.1 out of 10
B000089RVX|5.0|I just purchased Evanescence's albulm Fallen at the request of a freind and have been listening to this album non-stop for the last 3 days.  I am more often than not, never really impressed with much of the pre-packaged music of this current generation.<BR>However, without a doubt Ms. Lee's talent is undeniable.  She is magnificent on many of the tracks; especially My Immortal.<BR>I am recommending this albulm to many of my associates and freinds.
B00008H2LB|5.0|You know, there have been countless times in my life where i have anticipated a sophomore album by a band and been let down.  Everyone always feels like change is a good thing.  This is what i really like about Meteora.  If you liked the Sounds from Hybrid Theory, the beats, the rhymes, and the orginiality, you will love Metora.  Linkin Park has out done themselves by taking their unique sounds and improving it instead of changing things around to make them sounds like a different band.  But the kicker to all of this is, its not the same repetitive garbage.  It's Linkin Park, need i say more.  Chester still has his voice, Shinoda kept his flow, and Phoenix provides an original sound to the music, providing a wonderful break from all ... that sounds the same in the rock world.  <br />On  apersonal note, if you are a big fan on lyricist Mike Shinoda, BUY THIS ALBUM!  Shinoda outdoes himself in Meteora with the tracks Nobody's Listening, Hit the Floor, and Lying From You.  If you thought that High Voltage and Step Up were amazing lyrics, listen to Nobody's Listening.  The track utilizes the skill of Phoenix prividing an oriental beat and Shinoda brings his game to the table, all of it.  <br />Another track that struck me was Dont Stay, it had One Step Closer written all over it.  By this, i dont mean that they tried to cop out the sounds that made them famous, i mean it has the hook One Step closer gave with its beat that wouldnt go away.  Dont Stay has that hook.<br />Buy Meteora, you wont regret it.

B000059PPN|3.0|Norman Boyle, his wife Lucy, and his young son Bob take a 6-month lease on a house in New Whitby, a Boston suburb.  Norman is a researcher, continuing the work of his predecessor, Dr. Peterson, who had been working in the same house before committing suicide under mysterious circumstances.<br />The Boyles arrive at their new home, a large, secluded structure in the woods near an old graveyard.  A local girl named Anne comes to work with them as a housekeeper and babysitter.  Norman is gone for long periods of time, working at his office in town, leaving the family at the house.  Lucy begins to hear strange sounds in the building.<br />Mrs. Gilson, the real estate agent who arranged for the lease, stops by to visit the Boyles, but finds the house empty.  She thinks she hears movement in the basement, and goes to investigate.  A shadowy form emerges from the darkness and kills her.  Later, Anne is also murdered in the basement.<br />Norman discovers some notes by Dr. Peterson concerning the original occupant of the house, a certain Dr. Freudstein.  Freudstein had lived in the house a century before, and had been disbarred as a physician for conducting strange and unorthodox experiments.  Peterson had reached the conclusion that Freudstein was still alive, somehow extracting cellular material from others to perpetuate his zombie-like existence.<br />Norman rushes home, to find Bob trapped in the basement, threatened by the grotesque figure of Freudstein.  Both Norman and Lucy try to save Bob.  Freudstein kills both of them, but in the confusion of the struggle, Bob manages to escape.  The house is deserted once more-except for Freudstein. . . .<br />Directed by Lucio Fulci, The House By The Cemetery is an adequate if unimpressive Gothic exercise, fairly restrained by Fulci's standards, and rather slow-paced.  If the ranking system permitted, my rating for this would really be two-and-a-half stars.
0553579908|5.0|It just gets better.  Surprises, character development, fantastic setting, and a plot that is well thought out and has direction.  Excellent novel.
6302801249|5.0|This is my favorite movie but Why to be careful ? just because there are two versions: the european version and the US version.  The European version is just a jewel but (I don't know why) in the US version the wonderful Eric Serra's music was replaced by Eric Contì's very comercial  soundtrack and the producers added a happy ending (??!!) so they distroyed the whole concept.<br />If you are looking for the french version be sure you buy the Director's cut edition.<br />Felix<BR>Barcelona, Spain
055357342X|5.0|The best of the three novels.  They only get better as they are written.  Keeps you hanging on for the next novel!  Great read.
B00008977N|5.0|It's nice to finally have this on DVD. The sound quality is superb and different, I guess the DVD has different vocal tracks for some songs, I own the VHS version too and there are songs like Solsbury Hill or Secret World qhere you can notice interesting differences vs the DVD (vocal errors included).<br />The audio mix shows some nice details that were hidden in the VHS version  like soft touches of David Rhodes in guitar, Shankar inviolin, Manu katche and Mr.  Toni Levin astonishing job on Bass guitar, stick, etc but hides or reduces some others.<br />I haven't had picture problems in my DVD the picture quality is by far better that thr VHS versions.  At least that is true for home DVD players I have tested.<br />There's a very interesting surprise in the DVD. I live in spain (Pal format and Zone 2) but I bought the SWL DVD since I own a Multi format / multi zone DVD.  The surprise was that it is labeled as Zone 0 (the world logo with a 0 inside) instead of Zone 1 as is announced by Amazon.  That means that anyone with a NTSC compatible DVD (PAL/NTSC for europe) could play this one.<br />To have this DVD is  good warming up for the oncoming  PG concert, the Growing Up tour bonus  documentary is excellent and shows some of the things we can expect (production musicians, commentaries, etc)<br />IMHO this is the best concert DVD money can buy right now<br />Felix<BR>Barcelona, Spain
1402532903|3.0|I really liked the premise of this book! Someone who has gone on before her family and friends looking over them from Heaven!<BR>The characters were interesting enough and especially now with the Elizabeth Smart case the subject was the right one for this time we live in! However the sex part was really uncalled for when will authors learn that sex does nothing for a book on my part anyway. Also premarital sex does not exist in my heaven I don't know about yours!
0316666343|5.0|The Corrections was good.  The Lovely Bones is great.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This new album is just as strong and fun as the previous three. I love the White Stripes and hope they keep putting out such high quality material. This cd rocks hard all the way beginning to end. It goes to eleven baby!
B00008O31H|5.0|I love the Big Come Up. It's rock and roll, as if rock and roll had never lost it's way. Thickfreakness is even better. The songs are more evolved, the guitar more startling, and the drumming even more economical.  Auerbach's singing is just as passionate and soulful, but because the lyrics are more devloped, he's got even more to work with. And... it's just as raw and gritty as The Big Come Up. This is a great album.
0140177396|5.0|this book is an excellent between two friends in the heart of the Great Depression in the 30's. George, is a witty guy who takes care of his friend george, a mildly mentally challenged guy who can gets paid extremly well when he gets jobs becayse of his strength and determination. But a downward spiral of events tests the friendship of these two men.
B00008I8IF|5.0|this album is awesome. it mixes sounds from the 60s to 80s alt country to rockin' sounds for the new millenium. it's definitely all jayhawks, probably returning a bit more to their roots then the last album. incredible tracks to sample are 'rainy day', 'one man's problem', and 'tailspin'.<br />please remember that when it comes to bands that don't sell gazillions of records, downloading their music illegally hurts the band much more directly than the record label. trust me, this particular album should sell for 25 or 30 bucks, so you're getting a great deal!
B00005NRO3|5.0|After the incredible, phenomenal success of the first \\"Scream\\" movie, a sequel was inevitable. Actually, it was inevitable from the start since a part 2 and 3 were already planned and part of Kevin Williamson's deal when selling the first movie. While many people thought this was only made since the first one was such a monster hit, it was not. I'm sure the box office didn't hurt tho!. Kevin Williamson is back with another sharp, fresh, and clever screenplay. Wes Craven is back in the director's chair and makes that screenplay into a stylish thriller that exceeds all expectations and puts the \\"sequels ...\\" curse to rest...for now anyways. It's been two years since the grisly murders and stalking of Sidney Prescott in Woodsboro, and now Sidney is enrolled in college and trying to put her life back in order. It's much easier said than done since she is now caught up in the frenzy of a new movie called \\"Stab\\", which is a film about what happened in Woodsboro based on the book \\"The Woodsboro Murders\\", by tabloid journalist Gale Weathers(Courtney Cox). Two young students(Jada Pinkett, Omar Epps)are killed during the premiere of the film in the movie's dazzling and well executed opener, and the hunt is on once again. A copycat killer dressed in ghost figure attire is jumping on the \\"Stab\\" hysteria and stalking Sidney and her friends. Returning is Gale, who is still the money loving, attention getter we loved to hate in the original, but we love more now here. Deputy Dewey(David Arquette)is back as well, having survived the stabbed in the back incident from the original. Unfortunatley, it has left him with a bad leg and limp. Film geek Randy(Jamie Kennedy)is back as well, and sets the tone for the film when he explains the rules of a horror sequel. Cotton Weary(Liev Schreiber)also appears in this one. He has a far more interesting and pivotal role than he did in the brief moments he had in the original film. We are introduced to a new pack of characters as well. Sidney's boyfriend Derek, who is played by Jerry 'O' Connell, film lover<BR>Mickey, Sid's roomate Hallie, and Gale's new camerman Joel, among others. \\"Buffy\\" star Sarah Michelle Gellar also appears in one of the films's best moments. Former \\"Roseanne\\" star Laurie Metcalfe, and David's father Lewis Arquette, round out the great cast. The movie definitley knows that it is a sequel and is fully aware of how sequels usually go. There's even a great scene about students talking about film sequels. But what the first film did horror films, this one does with horror film sequels and gives it a fresh and clever spin. The scares are great and the suspense scenes are carefully executed and fully effecting. The movie still manages to be surprising and scary and catch us off guard, unlike so many sequels. Neve Campbell is a fabulous scream queen heroine. She does another solid turn as Sidney. Cox looks fantastic in this one. Gale is such an entertaining character to watch. Arquette has the Dewey schtick down pat, although it feels as if he wasn't given much to do this time around and was out of the action quite early than he should have been. While many horror films seem to only care about violence and a high body count, these films are about the characters. Not the killer or what he does and how he goes about doing it. It's about why it's happening and how these characters that we have come to love and cheer on will respond to it. Wes and company did something that many people didn't think they would. They made a sequel that is as convincing, smart, scary, and entertaining as the original. \\"Scream 2\\" is a follow up that not only does the brilliant original justice, but it also gives sequels a good name.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Since most of the previous 264 reviews have already said this is not quite a greatest hits album, I suppose I should be number 265 (or so).  But in my opinion, this CD is a textbook example of Nirvana's resonance and their sound.  If Kurt was still alive today, I think this is how he'd want it to be.  Kurt was a big fan of Nirvana's earlier work; and subsequently was \\"ruined\\" by the success Nevermind brought him.  Other reviewers have noted that songs like \\"About A Girl\\" and \\"Been A Son\\" weren't singles; and thought they didn't deserve to be here.  When in fact they were singles, maybe not so much where [you] lived, and need to be here.  However, since these are opinionated reviews, I will say I thought \\"Milk It\\" should've been included.  But that's only because it's my favorite song.<br />The main reason Nirvana fans bought this CD is for \\"You Know You're Right\\".  But really, if you only wanted that one new song you could've downloaded it.  There have been hundreds of files floating around (whether entitled \\"YKYR\\" or \\"Over The Mountain\\").  But that's neither here nor there.  Most people don't realize that rare versions of \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" and \\"Been A Son\\" are also included.  The version of \\"Been A Son\\" was never released on CD and elongates the track (from 1:54) to well over two minutes.  And the single version of \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" is just as rare.  Even if you have all of Nirvana's earlier releases, those three rarities make this CD an essential.  On the other hand, this is THE place to start for coming-of-age Nirvana fans who've only heard songs like \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" or \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" on the radio.  I love how this album captures Nirvana's brilliance.  Many people cite \\"Dumb\\" as too uncharacteristic of Kurt Cobain and/or Nirvana; when really it was one of the better songs on the In Utero CD.  Again (excuse my pushiness), I do think \\"Milk It\\" deserved to be here.  It's such a raw song and finds Kurt Cobain speaking very outwardly about suicide.  Its edginess (and usage of the word `shxt') is probably why it never became a big hit.  The unplugged versions of \\"All Apologies\\" and \\"The Man Who Sold The World\\" are certainly choice selections.  I did not know \\"All Apologies\\" was unplugged when I bought this, but was surprisingly happy when I heard it.  I've seen some reviews that feature \\"Where Did You Sleep Last Night\\" in the listings, but my CD does not have it.  Still, that's okay; as I feel the David Bowie cover is much more appropriate.<br />Overall, there is not a song that isn't worthy of being here.  There are a few songs that might have been good selections if it were extended to 16 or 17 songs (i.e. \\"Milk It\\", \\"Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle\\", \\"Lake Of Fire\\"), but we as fans must take the bad with the good.  And even if one of your favorite Nirvana tracks isn't here, you shouldn't knock the CD, give it three or four stars, and tell people not to buy it.  This is a greatest hits as Kurt's love and inspiration (Courtney Love) deems fit.  There's an excellent biography in the booklet, some cool pictures and 14 unforgettable, unbelievable songs.  If you don't like one or two of these songs then you're not a true Nirvana fan.  And you're just like those people who sing along to \\"In Bloom\\"; not knowing what it means.  I could give this album 4 stars because it doesn't have my favorite song, but that wouldn't be fair to the band.  At the end of the day, the title of this recording says it all.  Buy this.  And learn to love it over time... if you can't initially.giness (and usage of the word `shxt') is probably why it never became a big hit.

6305903182|5.0|You know how the old saying goes. Everything must come to an end. Sadly, one of the best and most clever series in the genre closes it's final chapter with 'Scream 3'. Even though thr franchise was only around for a little over 3 years, it felt a lot longer. Kevin Williamson was absent on this entry, unfortunatley, but Ehren Krueger, who went on to write \\"The Ring\\", steps up and does a great job. The master, Wes Craven, also returns. Part 2 set up the rules for a horror sequel, but this time around our gang of characters and newbies are playing by the trilogy rules. All bets are off. We pick up a ways into the future as we are re-introduced to heroine Sidney Prescott, once again played with heart and conviction by Neve Campbell. She has become a recluse living in the hills, who has never forgotten the horrors she has seen. Gale Weathers(Courteney Cox)is back on the prowl, as is Deputy Dewey(David Arquette), who is working as a consultant on \\"Stab 3\\", a sequel to the film series that was turned into a movie from Gale's book, \\"The Woodsboro Murders\\". Gale is also being followed by an actress(Parker Posey), who is playing her in the \\"Stab\\" films. As production on the new film commences, a new killer pops up and the body count begins rising. It appears that the killer is going thru the script knocking off the actors in sequence as they die in the script. The only problem is that there is a different draft of the script, and no one knows which on the killer is going by. This leads Sidney out of hiding to become the killer's number one target again. New revelations are revealed about Sidney's past and all the connections from the first film are brought back up and given a real ending. It's a smart way how they tie it all up. This sequel is really a movie within a movie. We see re-creations of sets from the first film on movie lots and that whole bit. The new film introduces us to other new characters as well. Deputy Kincaid(Patrick Dempsey), who is assigned the new case of killings. Roman Bridger(Scott Foley of \\"Felicity\\"), the director of the new film. Jenny McCarthy, Deon Richmond, and others fill out the cast of the \\"Stab Movie\\". Liev Schreiber returns as Cotton Weary in the film's glorious opening. Horror director Roger Corman has a small cameo, and veteran actor Lance Henriksen plays the film's shady producer. It was slightly evident in this entry that the series was going to paint itself into a corner. By now, we pretty much knew the game and how things worked in a 'Scream' movie. The problem is that Craven and Krueger pretty much stick to the formula and don't really do anything new or refrshing like they did in the original. Some of the story's end resolutions bring some surprises, but the film as a whole really doesn't. But don't think for one second that this in any way hurts the film. It's still an intriguing tale that delivers incredible fun, thrills, chills, and unending entertainment. As for our characters, they are still the heart and soul of these films. What's surprising here is that Neve seems to of had a smaller part. This seems to be more of a Gale movie since that character appeared to have more screen time than Sid. Of course, Sidney really comes into her own and becomes the main victim once again. Didn't it look like Courteney Cox was wearing a wig in this film?. Jamie Kennedy also returns in a brief cameo, via video, as Randy. If this is truly the end, then it goes out in grand style. The last scene with Sidney and the opened door was a real nice touch. The movie is still clever, witty, suspenseful, and a lot of fun. It is ten times better than a part 3 in a horror series has any right to be. That is quite an accomplishment in itself. Keep on screaming!.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|Faceless is an extremely hard hitting album with thunderous vocals, distorted guitars,and awesome drums and bass. &quot;Straight Out of Line&quot; is a radio hit but is def. not the best song on the album. Each song is extremely hard and gets you pumped up to the extreme. Great songs are &quot;Re-aligned,&quot; &quot;I F**kin Hate You&quot; and a few others off the 12 track disc. The only reason why i gave this album a 4 out of 5 is because by the end of the album i felt that, even though they werent, every song had the same kind of sound and feel to it which made it more of a homogeneous album. Nevertheles, this is still anwesome album and almost every song is great. If you like Godsmack and their other cd's, get Faceless. You wont be dissapointed!
B000053GTF|3.0|This ten year song and video of Celine Dion fell short to my expectations. I realize that there were so many outstanding performances and videos that she made over the past ten years, it would be impossible to put all of them on one dvd. But I did expect to see her best. I did not.  There were some music videos on this collection that I never saw before. I am not saying they were not good but far from her best.  For instance, her duo with Andrea Boccelli or for that matter Barbra Streisand was not on it.  One of her great duet performances was with Pebo Bryson called \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", it was on the dvd but Pebo did not sing it with her.<br />If you are a great fan of Celine, like I am, buy this dvd, but don't expect the world.
0385504209|5.0|This is the best intellectual thriller in a long time. This book has it all....murder, mystery, religion, art history, and puzzle solving. I immediately went to danbrown.com to check out the actual photos of the places and paintings he discusses in his novel. I've recommended this one to all my friends. Don't wait for the paperback!<br />For a terrific murder mystery in paper-back, read Freeman's MURDER IN KEY WEST... it's got it all, as well.
6305922756|5.0|Possibly the funniest movie I have ever seen. The extras on this DVD are worth the price and more. Watching the movie is great, but then watching the movie with the audio commentary (which features the &quot;musicians&quot; talking about random stuff, like ear infections, the name of their skull, if people are dead, making fun of Viv), is even funnier. There is also about 45 minutes of deleted scenes, as well as music videos, commercials and other interviews. The start up menu is amazingly funny as well.
0671578855|5.0|This will be a short and sweet review:  This is a wonderful SF novel, and definitely one of the best in this series.  Buy it!  Read it!  Love it!
B000089RVX|5.0|Bought the CD because of the single &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; and was NOT dissapointed in any way. If you don't have this CD in your collection, I highly recommend that you buy it. VERY worth it!
B00007E8O5|5.0|Jerry Cantrell is clearly the man. This is an amazing musical work, every bit as good as Alice in Chains (the best of the Grunge bands, in my opinion). If you're a fan of Alice you must own the record. If you love good rock, you must own this record. Cherish it. There is not a bad song here, there's not even a marginal song here. Some are absolute classics. Anger Rising is wonderful, as is Spiderbite, Pig Charmer and Bargain Basement Howard Hughes. There are other diamonds here, and no rough whatsoever!
B000002IZ4|5.0|Purple is quite possibly one of my favorite albums of all time. Ironically, No.4 is my fav. STP album. I simply love both.<br />What makes this album stand-out the most is the hit single &quot;Interstate Love Song.&quot; This song is truely one of my fav songs of all time. What makes this song so great is that it gives a rare aura to it that makes it easy to listen to no matter what mood you are in. It's a little eerie, dark, poppy, catchy, fun, mellow, rock, depressing, and even happy all rolled into one. 3min and 13secs is a perfect time limit for any good song, not too long and not too short. If you haven't heard this song, buy this album, you won't be disappointed.<br />Other highlights of this album is the mellow, slow &quot;Big Empty&quot; that clarifies the great variety Scott Weiland has to his musical ability to write and sing. &quot;Vasoline&quot; is a fast tempo in your face come at you hard rock experience that will want you begging for more. The songs, &quot;Still Remains&quot; and &quot;Pretty Penny&quot; are also catchy pop rock songs that make this such a great album.<br />If you aren't convinced enough that STP isn't just another Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, or even Nirvana, check out this album. Core may be a replica of early 90s grunge, but Purple clearly solidifies Stone Temple Pilots as one of the great bands of the 90's and even into this decade.
B0000844I8|4.0|Okay, I just want to start by saying this was a pretty good movie. Not as good as the series it spawned mind you, but still good. I always liked it, even more so after falling in love with SG1.<BR>   That having been said I want to talk about the DVD. I found the featurette entitled &quot;Is there a stargate?&quot; quite interesting. The two disks for the directors cuts and theatrical cut were a pretty good idea. I really liked that. The only real complaint I have is a big one as far as I'm concerned. It's the audio commentary.<BR>   The commentary tracks are, in my opinion, one of the greatest ideas since home video. Sometimes I decide whether or not to buy a DVD soleley on whether or not they have a commentary track. I really love them, but I swear I'll never listen to this one again. I don't know why they let Roland Emmerich do these things. Every two words are &quot;like kindof&quot; he can't go more than 2 sentences without sticking those words in there about ten times each. <BR>   After 5 minutes of listening to this I realized that I'd suffered through one of this guys commentaries before. The Patriot. Another good DVD ruined by this guys endless string of &quot;like kindof.&quot; Maybe this doesn't bother others as much as it does me, but I know one thing. From now on I'm not only checking to see if a DVD has a commentary track, but I'm gonna make damn sure he's not on it.
B00008H2LB|2.0|after 2 1/2 years all they could muster was 36 minutes.  Somewhere I Belong and Don't Stay, Faint, and Numb are really the only tracks worth listening to over and over and if it was not for those 4 songs this album would be a complete waste.  Hopefully they did not commit career suicide by doing this.  Fans expected at least close to an hour of what they came to expect from these guys which is maybe a little heavier than Hybrid in some cases and mellower in others.  I am a little worried that we will wait another 2 1/2 years for another project and it will be only 20 minutes.
0694524743|5.0|This is an awesome book. It is about 4 kids who find their way into a magical land through a wardrobe in their grandfather's house. While there, they encounter all sorts of mythical animals like the centuar and others. There is an evil white witch who has kept it winter forever but no Christmas. Then, there is Aslan, the all powerful lion who protects the children. The four kids have wonderful adventures, and learn about themselves and their siblings. <BR>   I think that C.S. Lewis did an excellent job with this book. He made this story his own, not elaborating off anybody else's. He used imagery, symbolism, and personification to make the book interesting. The plot and story line is like none other I've read. I recommend it to everybody, all ages, because it doesn't matter how many times you have read this book every time you read it you get something deeper out of it.
B000089RVX|4.0|Bring Me to Life is awesome and I am glad it may have gotten 12 Stones on the map as well.  This whole album is greast and one of the few out there you can put in your CD player and let go.
B000002UY5|5.0|I bought this cd years ago under the strength of the song, Tones of Home, which I heard on a friend's mix-tape.  It remains one of my favorite cds in my collection.<br />This band is so underrated, and I think it's a shame.  Perhaps if Shannon Hoon hadn't died in such an untimely manner, more people could have had the opportunity to discover Blind Melon.  With a great mix of blues, funk, and folk, Blind Melon has one of the most unique, fresh sounds in music.  Hoon's voice is a marvel - from somber and soulful crooning to high pitched Robert Plant-like wails, his range leaves most singers in the dust.  Add insightful, heartfelt lyrics, and some fantastic guitar work to the the mix, and you have one fine album.
B000000OQF|5.0|Just got turned on to this new rock and roll band called Guns N Roses.  The lead singer W. Axl Rose has a great voice and seems to really involve the other members in this masterpiece.  He seems to share the glory instead of hogging it all to himself.  My buddy told me that they are also not the \\"Rock N Roll\\" type that do drugs and chase women.  Axl apparantly grew up singing in a choir and has the right upbringing we so desparately need in rock n roll.  Slash who's real name is Saul was recruited to play in Poison years ago but opted not to wear makeup so Axl gobbled him up 6 months ago to be the man on the axe.  Duff McKagan and Izzy are the type of boys you would want to take home to your family to show off.  Duff likes the Jack and Coke without the Jack.  Welcome to the Jungle mark my words will be a hige hit as will Paradise City.  Look for these 2 songs to blow up on MTV soon.  You're Crazy is about Axl telling all the people who he thought was a dreamer what he thought cause he knew he would hit it big.  Mr. Brownstone is about the janitor at Axl's middle school who never stopped believing in this skinny red heads dream.  He was a true mentor to Axl.  I guarantee this record will go multi platinum.

B000001FI7|5.0|If it wasn't for Portishead's vocalist Beth Gibbons, you could listen to Dummy all of the time. With tight, fresh hip-hop beats and a subtle jazz flavor, most of Dummy is danceable, although the band do have a knack for creating an especially eerie mood with moaning organs and swelling strings. But when Gibbons enters the scene, her clear delicate vibrato casts a shadow of isolation and absolute melancholy over the whole album.<br />Portishead easily draw you into their lonely world, and their ambient trip-hop entices you to stay. Songs like &quot;Numb&quot; and &quot;Biscuit&quot; are dark trances enduced by the combination of hip-hop, mellow guitars, and a variety of samples coated by Gibbon's desperate pleas for salvation. Hearing her cry, &quot;Nobody loves me, it's true&quot; (from the superhit &quot;Sour Times&quot;) is enough to tear at anyone's heart.<br />On &quot;Roads&quot; - a track already enveloped in sorrowful elegant strings - Gibbon's soprano trembles with pain. However, the twisted lounge acts, &quot;Strangers&quot; and &quot;Pedestal&quot; feature very soulful and powerful vocals accompanied by some excellent jazz performances.<br />The last track, &quot;Glory Box&quot;, is Portishead in full blow. Over a sample from Isaac Hayes' &quot;Ike's Rap III&quot; and a slinky blues guitar, Gibbons duels with herself as she tries to justify a relationship. She first comes off as a contemptuous Billie Holiday and then switches back to her sweet, sad self as she pleads, &quot;Give me a reason to love you/ I just want to be a woman.&quot;<br />By all means, Dummy is an essential album for trip-hop fans and beginners. A definite keeper.
B000001DV2|4.0|As noted in the booklet, \\"Adrenalize\\" was dedicated to the late Def Leppard guitarist, Stephen Maynard Clark. His death was, in fact, Def Leppard's \\"starting point\\" for this CD. Although \\"Adrenalize\\" isn't one of my favorites by them (that would probably be \\"Hysteria\\"--which, of course, I have somehow lost), it's still one of their best earlier CDs, opening with a fluffy angst song for the young male crowd, \\"Let's Get Rocked.\\" Like this first track, most of the songs on \\"Adrenalize\\" are fast and pop-oriented, but there are few good ballads thrown in, like my two favorites on here: \\"Tonight\\" and \\"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad.\\" This CD is certainly worth a listen if you're a Def Leppard fan and/or like '80s/'90s pop rock.
B000060P79|1.0|Here's another example of how sad the popular music scene is at the moment.I guess the good thing is that most of the people buying this album are 12, and think they're punk.Don't worry kids, you'll grow out of that phase.If you want to listen to some good pop punk/emo, check out the Reputation or Rainer Maria's new album.Once again, the girls have to show the boys how to rock...buy this album if you like Good Charlotte, or the Ataris.They've been having success with the &quot;12 yr old punk&quot; scene.
0870703781|5.0|William Eggleston's photos grow on you. Look through this book for the first time and the contents seem a bit like ordinary snapshots but look again and then again and with each viewing the images become more familiar (still with something fresh to discover each time) but now they start to blend together seamlessly. One reason for this, I think, is that the photos capture the everyday and the ordinary. Taken around Eggleston's hometown of Memphis and in the Deep South, they show some of his relations, street scenes, interiors, buildings and more, though the captions only state the locations. John Szarkowski says in the books introduction \\"..today's most radical and suggestive color photography derives much of its vigor from commonplace models\\" This capturing of the everyday and in color divided the critics in 1976 when the Museum of Modern Art used seventy-five of Egglestons's images for their first exhibition of color photography. The 'Guide' unfortunately only shows forty-eight from the show.    Art photography until this exhibition was in black and white and had been for years, color photos were mostly for ads, commercial print and snapshots. Thankfully the Museum's curator of photography, Szarkowski, had the good sense to allow the public to see something new and fresh. I think the 'Guide' is a good introduction to Eggleston and if you like his creative vision, as I do, have a look at these two books of his work:[[ASIN:0385266510 The Democratic Forest]] and [[ASIN:0517143933 Ancient & Modern]]. Both are full of wonderful color photos of the American everyday.    ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover.
B000084T18|5.0|When 50 Cent was first introduced to the public with the song 'Wanksta' I must admit I hated 50, I really didn't want to try to like 50 Cent. <br />Then I Heard the media and other sources comparing him to the greatest 2Pac. When I Heard that I Was like, no Way that he would even remotely be like 'Pac. But when the album hit the streetz 'Get Rich Or Die Tryin' I couldnt stay away for long, so I had to take a listen. Although Im not gonna agree with the people that compare him to 'Pac, or even say he's better than 'Pac, for people that say that, their just completely stupid.  <br />As for this album this is a great release by 50. <br />My Track Ratings:<br />1.

B00005LOUP|4.0|When I first saw this movie in the theater, I wasn't sure what to think of it -- I kept comparing it mentally to the animated Grinch.  My kids, however, absolutely loved it and begged me to buy it on DVD.  Now, after watching it (over and over and over...) I have to say that the movie has grown on me and I quite enjoy it!<br />I really loved Jim Carrey as the Grinch -- his facial expressions, despite being covered in pounds of latex makeup, were truly in keeping with the spirit of the original, animated classic.  For example, when the Grinch gets that &quot;awful idea&quot; and he grins that terrible grin where his cheeks positively curl up, Jim Carrey not only accomplishes that grin, but goes it one better!  <br />What had to grow on me was the back-story of why the Grinch ended up the way he is, but I do have to say that I enjoy it now.  The more I watch the movie, the more little details I pick out that make me chuckle.<br />Little Cindy-Lou Who is adorable (though not as young as the one in the animated film) and the actress truly holds her own against the zany mugging of Mr. Carrey.<br />All in all, a very enjoyable rendition of the Grinch tale, and a good family movie!  Enjoy!
B000059TPI|5.0|Several people have said that 'Harvey' is just a feel-good movie. I strongly disagree- There is no 'Just' about it. A feel good movie can be very valuable, and this one is Priceless. Jimmy Stewart is AWESOME as Elwood P. Dowd. The lady who plays Veta Louise, his older sister, is really good too. The only handicap in this movie is the Phsychiatrist. His whole character makes me sort of perturbed, though for the life of me I don't know why. The plot goes something like this- <BR>Elwood P Dowd is a friendly alcoholic who has an 'imaginary' friend- a 6 foot 3 and a half inch white rabbit named Harvey. Elwood, with his bunny buddy lives with his sister, Veta Louise and her daughter Myrtle Mae. Veta is upset because 'Harvey' is ruining her chances of getting Myrtle started in social life. She tries to commit Elwood to an Asylum, but, through a comedy of errors, She ends up being comitted herself. Eventually, things get straightened out and Elwood gets a chance to learn that Harvey isn't really real- or IS he? <BR>A real sweet movie. Perfect for a day when everything's going wrong.
