B000I9VZJ8|4.0|This is a sweet, funny movie, also very goofy, and endearing at times.  Great for tween boys at a slumber party.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Loved the book Morgan is a great author. If you enjoy lord of the rings or anything along those lines u will love the book it keeps you interested all the way through with a great story line. Hope the next one is out soon!
B0096CDG0O|1.0|Slow, boring. The game breaks and gives odd errors about your internet connection not working. You lose your game. You are at the other players mercy to pat their turn. Could take hours, days, or years.

B003P2WJ6S|5.0|This book captures the true life story of a family who could have easily been mine.  It also is explores research ethics.  Now I really understand the rigorous process to have my research approved for my dissertation.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|I read this book twice already and most probably I will get back to it from time to time. Body language comes alive in this essential reference for non-verbal communication. Through a mix of well placed anecdotes and sound research, Navarro offers an intense and fact packed publication that will go down well with many who find non-verbals intriguing or important in their line of work or day-to-day interactions.
B009JBZH54|5.0|PROS: If you're a  Batman fan (with actor Christian Bale) these are excellent entertaining movies.  And, if you're not a Batman fan they're still a good form of entertainment.<br /><br />CONS: None.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Our daughters and myself monitor over-the-air entertainment so our grandchildren are not exposed to adult foul words or imoral adult situations.  We watched this movie as a family &#34;movie night&#34; and was nice to watch something that adults had not inserted their worldy messages or language.  Just pure entertainment.  Thanks!
B004XISI4A|1.0|I have to preface by saying I loved book 1 but have been increasingly disappointed with subsequent novels. (OK maybe book 3 was reasonable). It is sad to see a series where each book is about half as good as the one before it. Martin needs an editor with an iron fist. This book makes watching grass grow exciting. Really, why take every character that you have built over many books and either degrade them, make them unpleasant and unlikable, or just slit their throat. And while you are at it, throw in some brand new characters who meander around contributing nothing to the overarching storyline.<br /><br />I so enjoyed the first book. I survived the death of so many main characters in the next few books. But now, I just can't be bothered anymore. The whole series should have stayed a trilogy. I can't make the effort to wade through chapters of nothing to get the odd tidbit of plot progression.<br /><br />Can someone tell me after they finish the series if anyone worth caring for survives? Do the dragons come and melt the icy bad guys? Does Tyrion get to be King? Do I really care?

1400067820|5.0|In The Bed of Procrustes, Nassim Taleb's book of aphorisms, he wrote: &#34;An idea starts to be interesting when you get scared of taking it to its logical conclusion.&#34;<br /><br />Here's a thought experiment: suppose you were sending a package with delicate items to a friend - what would you write on the package?  Since you don't want the ornaments to break, you'd likely write &#34;fragile&#34; on the package.  Now, suppose for some strange reason you were sending some rocks (say, a pet rock) in a package to a friend - what would you write on the package then?  Obviously you wouldn't need to write anything on it because the rocks are robust and wouldn't be harmed even if they were grossly mishandled.<br /><br />Those may sound like banal questions, with trivial answers, but here's a more interesting question: what would you write on a package that you wanted to be purposely mishandled?  Or, what should we call something that is the exact opposite fragile, i.e., something that is not only robust, but actually gets stronger from being mishandled?  Until fairly recently there was no word for this term, but the answer is that you'd write the neologism &#34;antifragile&#34;, coined by Taleb in his provocative book Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder.<br /><br />Antifragile is part of a larger corpus called Incerto, which includes the books Dynamic Hedging, Fooled By Randomness, The Black Swan, and The Bed of Procrustes.  Technically, Antifragile itself is composed of seven books, but I will simply refer to it as one book for the purpose of this review. [1]<br /><br />***<br /><br />One of the most interesting things about being human is that we can understand things we can't necessarily articulate.  Often the reason we can't articulate an idea is that we lack the linguistic tool to talk about it, but lacking the tool to talk about an idea doesn't necessarily preclude us from understanding it.  Taleb is not the first human to understand antifragility, but he is the first person to give us the linguistic tool to talk about it.<br /><br />Taleb cites an interesting anecdote from the linguist Guy Deutscher near the beginning of the book.  What Taleb learned from Deutscher was that until 140 years ago the Greeks didn't have a word for the color blue.  Strangely though, they still saw the color blue when they looked to the sky.  They weren't, then, physically color blind, but rather culturally color blind.  Similarly, even though we have long understood some of the ramifications of antifragility when we've seen it, we moderns have been culturally blind to it.<br /><br />Evolution is the perfect example of a system with antifragile properties.  Biological evolution, in particular, thrives off of randomness, stressors, and volatility, which ultimately cause adaptations to occur in individual organisms, and evolution to occur in the species.  For example, consider the discovery of penicillin.  It was an evolutionary (and harmful) shock to bacteria, but new forms of bacteria have adapted to the point where they are immune to the devastating consequences of penicillin.  By trying to harm the bacteria, we have actually made them stronger, and this is precisely because they are antifragile.  Although Taleb never explicitly puts it this way, I think for things biological, antifragile properties are a necessary trait.<br /><br />One of the more practical things Taleb points out in the book is that the human body is also antifragile.  Intuitively, and more importantly empirically, weightlifters have long understood this.  They purposely break down their muscles through the stress of lifting heavy weights and their muscles rebuild themselves to be stronger than they were before adapting to the stress.  Antifragile systems (like humans) benefit from the recently revived concept of hormesis, which is the idea that small doses of harmful substances (like alcohol) are actually good for you because they make you stronger. [2]  Or, as the toxicologists would say, &#34;The dose determines the poison.&#34;  Taleb, however, is scornful of those who use his ideas to justify the pseudo-science of homeopathy.<br /><br />Another ancient idea that is discussed in the book is iatrogenics, which means harm caused by the healer.  Taleb suggests that Mother Nature and our bodies have a natural way of healing themselves and we often cause more harm through trying to naively &#34;fix&#34; things with medicines and surgical procedures (although this is not to say that all medicines and surgical procedures are bad).  The old practice of bloodletting is the perfect example.  Taleb reminds us that iatrogenic effects occur in fields outside of medicine too, like our economies and educational institutions.<br /><br />As astute readers of his prior works know, Taleb is not particularly fond of most bankers, academics, economists, and journalists for a plethora of reasons, namely because they suffer from a form of epistemic arrogance and naïve rationalism that not only harms themselves, but harms others as well.  In Antifragile, Taleb has coined the term &#34;fragilista&#34; to refer to these individuals.  Fragilistas, according to Taleb, naively try to suck the antifragility out of systems that depend on it for its wellbeing, and they occasionally suffer from severe ethical lapses too.<br /><br />Neurotic soccer moms are one such type of fragilista and they join the company of fragilista economists and journalists like Alan Greenspan, Paul Krugman, Joseph Stiglitz, and Thomas Friedman.  Fragilista Robert Rubin, the former high ranking Citigroup official, had the honor of having &#34;The Bob Rubin Problem&#34; named after him because of an ethical lapse in which he finagled his way into getting financial upside without any possible downside at the taxpayers expense (a violation of Hammurabi's Code).<br /><br />For readers unfamiliar with Hammurabi's Code, Taleb described it as follows in a 2011 New York Times editorial: &#34;If a builder builds a house for a man and does not make its construction firm, and the house which he has built collapses and causes the death of the owner of the house, that builder shall be put to death.&#34;  The central idea behind the code, then, is that no one knows more about the house than the architect and they should not gain the upside without being exposed to downside.  The ancient Babylonians clearly recognized that the code would remedy the problems that occur in situations where there was an upside-without-downside asymmetry problem, like there is with modern banker's bonuses.<br /><br />***<br /><br />For as much as I love this book (and Taleb's other work), there is one thing that I must take issue with.  It seems to me that being both a humanist and a proponent of antifragility are incompatible views.  Taleb, however, claims that he is both of these things.  The reason I see this as a contradiction is because human biological evolution cannot progress without stress and selection pressures (of all kinds) on individual humans.  Thus, our attempts at saving weak individual people and trying to eliminate individual suffering may come at the expense of fragilizing the human species as a whole.  Humanists, in this sense, are fragilistas.<br /><br />As a humanist, one should innately value all human life and want to limit human suffering to any extent possible (a position I'm in favor of).  However, should this be done at the expense of fragilizing the species?  Not all fragilistas have ill intentions, and good-hearted efforts to improve the human condition often paradoxically make things worse.  As the old clich&eacute; goes, &#34;the road to hell is paved with good intentions.&#34;<br /><br />In his philosophical novel Thus Spoke Zarathustra Nietzsche introduced the ideas of both the ubermensch (translated to be the overman or superman) and the last man.  One interpretation of Nietzsche's work could be that the last man is the evolutionary byproductof a society run by fragilistas and that the ubermensch is the human ideal for proponents of antifragility (i.e., all that humans can become).<br /><br />As a proponent of antifragility myself, this interpretation makes me uncomfortable, but I cannot deny the fact that there is definitely a Nietzechean ring to the idea of antifragility.  If Nietzsche's ubermensch can be understood to be the byproduct of humanity's antifragility, then, Zarathustra was right, humanity can overcome itself if only it avoids fragilizing itself.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the things that defines us as humans, then, is that we morally, ethically, and systematically try to remove antifragility from the very antifragile system that created us (i.e., Mother Nature).  After reading this book, I can't help but think that Nietzsche understood something startlingly haunting about the human condition: whatever supersedes humanity will embrace its antifragility.ses and causes the death of the owner of the house, that builder shall be put to death.&#34;  The central idea behind the code, then, is that no one knows more about the house than the architect and they should not gain the upside without being exposed to downside.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Enjoyed playing Majhong especially ability to shuffle squares.  It is a lot of fun.  Plan to play a lot on a trip we are taking.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|This bible is the one I use,  and I read it mostly. Not hard to find things and easy to use. No complaints.
B0083DJWGO|4.0|Antifragile is composed of 7 books rolled into one.<br /><br />They are:<br /><br />Book I-- An Introduction to the Antifragile<br />Book II- Modernity and the Denial of Antifragility<br />Book III-A Nonpredictive View of the World<br />Book IV- Optionality, Technology, and the Intelligence of Antifragility<br />Book V-- The Nonlinear and the Nonlinear<br />Book VI- Via Negativa<br />Book VII-The Ethics of Fragility and Antifragility<br /><br />Taleb is essentially describing complex adaptive systems. This turns out to be better than a couple of other books that I've read because it at least gets about the business of addressing real-life examples *immediately*. From the first several pages, he tells us what his topics will be (evolution, politics, business innovation, scientific discovery, economics, ethics, epistemology/ general philosophy).<br /><br />Brings in a lot of characters/ themes from his other two heavy hitters early on. (Blowtorching of academics and experts. The character \\"Fat Tony.\\") He is also honest that this book is a compendium of a lot of ideas that he expressed in [[ASIN:081297381X The Black Swan: Second Edition: The Impact of the Highly Improbable: With a new section: \\"On Robustness and Fragility\\"]] and [[ASIN:B001SC9G5O Fooled By Randomness]]. To that end, you could probably read this book in lieu of the other two (although the other ones are not bad reads at a secondhand price).<br /><br />There are some new ideas and a lot of thought. One thing that I particularly like is his idea of self-selection in ideas (Loc 548). Things that you have been thinking about for a long time are good enough to write about. But things that you have to go to a library for which to deduce an argument are probably not something that you care about particularly passionately. Another way is his description of the petty feuds and backbiting that characterize academia. We all knew that such things existed, but his description was just so poetic that it was great to read. He also demonstrates that commerce is a great way for people to learn to \\"get along.\\"<br /><br />The one problem with the book is that it is just TOO LONG and uses TOO MANY WORDS (and this is not unexpected from reading Taleb's other works-- 550 pages could have been whittled down to about 275 or 225). Taleb's ego also came through (and after reading his aforementioned books we knew that it would show up-- and right soon) and that started to wear on the reader after hundreds and hundreds of pages.<br /><br />One thing that I do wonder (in response to Taleb's incessant repeating of the validity of things that have been arrived at through natural selection) is: \\"Is it really the case that something can't be improved on *just* because that is the conclusion that people have reached over some number of centuries?\\" China and India are two excellent examples of civilizations that have arrived at conclusions that are not helpful (i.e., aborting baby girls) and have stayed that way for many centuries). Another thing was: Is there *any* role for rationality (as Taleb sees it)? Not sure how he was making the case because he waffled on so much that it was hard to fish out his points sometimes.<br /><br />In fact, there are a lot of ideas/ subtle connections in this book and a lot of breadth. It won't be possible to do justice to the many points that the author made and still write a good book review. Instead, the verdict.<br /><br />Final verdict: Just barely worth the time (about 5 afternoons worth of reading), and just barely worth the (Kindle) purchase price. Recommended for a read.read.

B009DH379C|3.0|It seems no matter what setting I have it on when I play it on my receiver it looks like Fred is lip syncing? There is a slight delay in the audio track? It seems to be ok when I use just the TV speakers. And I tried other concert blu rays like the new scorpions and it plays fine just like other blu ray movies? Anyone else having this problem or did I just get a bad copy?
B009HEJXFS|3.0|it was ok... not as good as the first and second. and WS is getting old!! lol it gets a three star.

B003MOHX8S|5.0|I love this genre of music and use it all the time for my Yoga classes.  This album is full of winning songs with sweeping emotion, energy, and musical evocation.  I listen to it outside of teaching Yoga as well because the music is both energizing and calming.  This album made me a big fan of Two Steps From Hell.  I love &#34;Archangel&#34; as well.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I've seen my cousin play Minecraft lots of times and I really enjoy the game, then I saw that it came out on the kindle fire and I was really excited!!!! But then I saw the price and I understand that it's a really popular game but at least make it 5.00 or make the free app of the say or something.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Suspense, drama, zombies eating people, never knowing what's around the corner.  It's incredible and always keeps me on my toes!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I wasn't expecting much. So I was pleasantly surprised this book! I thoroughly enjoyed it. Kept me reading all in one setting. They both got on my nerves some with her insecurities and him being so clueless. But it came together and ended well. Cute and fun read!
B00A77II0U|5.0|Everybody should try playing this game. I play a lot of games and this storyline is one of the best I've come across. The characters in the game are really interesting, I kept wanting to play more, just to see what would happen next. Very spooky game, with great special effects and graphics. Very good ending with a bonus chapter. 5 stars for sure. WELL DONE !!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What can I say - If you read book one and two, why wouldn't you read book three?  Book three is the best and has the ending.  Great book, great series.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|One of the best shows we've come across recently.  The show has a touch of what 24 used to be while dressed up in a 'Showtime way'.  A great drama that keeps the action coming.  For anyone not hooked yet this would make a great gift.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you finished book one, you have to read book two.  It continues, sometimes a little too repetitive but you have to get through it to continue the saga to know what's going on with the story line - all in all it is a good book and gets you ready for book 3.

B0062NAVXA|5.0|The Kendrick brothers have come a long way from Flywheel to Facing the Giants to Fireproof to this. They are all masterfully done and Courageous - with a production budget significantly larger than any of their other productions - allows you to forget that this is a movie produced by a small church in the south. This is a must-have for any man - especially one with kids. You'll go through every emotion while you watch this. Highly highly recommended.
072325804X|5.0|Our youngest received one of these books as a gift.  He enjoyed listening to the stories and pointing to the beautifully illustrated pictures.  Nice, sturdy hardback.  They make fantastic gifts.

B002L9N4DS|5.0|Gary Sinise and Tom Hanks pull off their roles masterfully. They are amazing in this tale of a man with a big heart who always seems to be in the right place at the right time with the right people.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|some of the story line was familiar with the movie that Julia Roberts was in when she ran away from her controlling husband (Sleeping with the Enemy).  The ending was predictable once you saw the outline being formed.  I like Nicholas Sparks and I will go to the movie when it is out (early next year?).  If you are a fan of NS you won't go wrong making this purchase.
B00976NY6A|4.0|This is one of my favorite bands.  Ultimately my favorite album is Sam's Town, but this is a good album and has lots of enjoyable music.  The Killers are always on heavy iPod rotation in my car!<br /><br />Also, check out Brandon Flowers solo album &#34;Flamingo&#34; .... it is brilliant!
B008CPZNL6|4.0|It's a fun way to flip through news, facebook posts, photographs and whatever else you want to add. You never know where you might end up. It leads you from one interesting thing to another.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers of Catan (or &#34;Settlers&#34; to those familliar with the game) is a lot like monopoly in that you're constantly building relationships with other players yet your secret goal is to take their resources and build road straight across the board. You'll quickly find who your friends are in this game. I've spent more than one night on the sofa as a result of a game gone wrong! It is a steep learning curve at first and many take one full game (~2-3 hours) to learn it but once they have that &#34;ah ha&#34; moment they want to play again (and again and again). Very addictive!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Did what I wanted.Easy to use.I would get it again.I can find where my Kindle put downloads easily with this
B007PFD90G|4.0|I have been a fan of Rushdie for 20 years, having read the majority of his books.  The Satanic Verses was brilliant (as was Midnight's Children and Moore's Last Sigh).  What he went through as a result of writing that book is baffling.  I can see where some people may think he comes off a bit arrogant, but it is unapologetic and honest.  I have tons of respect for someone who will refuse to cower to the demands of the religious ignorant and stand up for freedom of speech. The fact that the Fatwa was carried on for so long is also baffling.  How is it possible that people think it's acceptable to kill someone for expressing an opposing opinion.<br /><br />All in all, an interesting memoir of a brilliant author.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|If you are a fan of this movie,  then this is the edition to buy. The book is full of great photographs, behind the scenes and scenes from the film and some fascinating background tidbits. I watched the movie and the both supplemental discs in one evening!
B002VECM72|5.0|Sandra Bullock does an amazing job in this movie. She has come a looooong way since Speed! This is a feel-good movie that no collection should be without.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is one of the best on television right now, and it keeps getting better. Gritty as hell and just brutal. I love that the story focuses more on the horrible aspects of human nature when faced with such atrocities, although zombies occasionally getting shit shoved through their pie holes is pretty cool to watch as well. And who knew that Morrissey could act? I sure didn't. He's a great addition to the cast.<br /><br />Can't wait to see where the last half of this season winds up.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Season 1 was great getting to know everyone! Season 2 was better as the plot thickens. Can't wait for season 3!.

0547884591|5.0|In spite of the intimidating size, this book is so easy to read. Above all else, it gives techniques for learning while using food and cooking as the subject. Like his other books, the 4 Hour Body and the 4 Hour Workweek, this book is both inspiring and instructive. It is not a book that you have to read straight through, you can jump around and still enjoy it. I highly recommend it!

080508990X|5.0|We love Eric Carle and had the three other books from this series.  My granddaughter loves to have this read to her and loves reading it to her dolls and stuffed animals.  Would recommend.
B006P96PAO|5.0|Good movie, maybe the best of the ones that Sherwood has produced. Like the Flywheel story best, but the difference in the production is huge.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Follett has again demonstrated excellent insight into a very complicated period of history.  I have enjoyed it immensely and, in the process, experienced drama and intrigue that can only come from truth.
B0083EW97W|3.0|This is still John Mayer's style but slightly different.  I like the laid back feel of the album but I think it's a little too much at times - so much so that the album passes by and you don't even notice it.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I love this movie and watched it first with my daughter when she was little.  So I purchased the dvd to watch with my granddaughter who also loves it.  It is so relaxing to watch.  I recommend it for anyone who is looking for a way to take the high stress out of the holidays.
B005FJ7DOM|3.0|Easy to download & view ~ I am always happy with my purchases on Amazon, I REALLY liked the cost, considering it was free! Thanks Amazon! :)
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Purchased this about a month after my son was born, and literally couldn't put it down for the week that it took me to read it (which caused some issues with, oh, tending to a newborn, but he survived!).  Great fun, and an easy read.  Didn't want it to end.
B000W93CHC|2.0|This was the second in a series by Ken Follett.  I finished the first book with relief frankly surprised that it had a happy ending after so much trajedy.  I got about a third of the way through this second in the series and gave up.  It was following the same pattern of character development and the same soap opera cycle of trajedy always just around the corner.  I  prefer my hero's and heroine's to learn from their mistakes as the narrative moves forward  This was just too much for me to cope with.  I had to move on to something else that had a point.  If you like trajedy always stalking your hero's and heroines as they naively step into the traps devised by their antagonists then this is for you.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|This was purchased as a gift for a friend.  He loves this movie and the quality of the dvd.  I would recommend this for any super hero fan.

I have all the Zep music now on CD's. It's not my vinyl but hey they took the stereo too. So, what can u do? Drive around and listen to some great music!!!!!
B004LROUW2|1.0|I hated this book.<br />I hated this book.<br />I hated this book.<br /><br />This is ho Haruki writes. He takes the same sentence and repeats it over and over again. He takes the same sentence and repeats it over and over again, I say.<br /><br />The story itself is OK, imaginative, but he seems to close off the ending far to quickly. The build up, character development, and nonsense was about 40% of the story. The &#34;action&#34; was about 20%, and the other 40% was repeating the first 40%

B003E6K1VK|5.0|I'm getting older.<br />I don't get out as much as I did when I was younger.<br />I got an Ipod, and listened to low quality mp3 and OK quality aac over some decent headphones ($200-$400).<br />After I plugged these in and used it with my etyomic's it was like I woke up from a deep sleep.<br /><br />I highly recommend this, if you have time to listen to music, and love what it is, and what it should be.
B0046MVVOW|5.0|I like this product is everything I thought and wanted. This is a great choice to buy for any and everyone.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is an extraordinary and fascinating book.  Goodwin brings to life dozens of pivotal figures whose lives at least in part intersected with Abraham Lincoln's.  The movie recently out is based in part on this book.  Even though I knew what happened, this book was my treat every day.  All I wanted to do was climb back in and read.  When the book ended I wanted to keep reading.  I learned so very much and understood so much more about the Civil War itself -- the battles and their significance -- and even having lived in DC, I never fully understood how constant and imminent the threat of battle in DC was.  And for once, women are more  hood ornaments.  Now I want Goodwin to do the same for the true story of the vote for women and our continuing absence from the US Constitution save for the right to vote (read it and the USSC decisions). Nevertheless,there are quite a number of parallels with some of the antagonistic and divisive politics of the present.  Indeed, those who do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it. I thoroughly recommend this book.
B007THA4FI|3.0|It started out very slow. Took a while to get my attention. Book is okay. J.K. Rowling is still a favorite author of mine so I will read more of her books if and when published.

1451695187|4.0|I was one of those people who was so thrilled when I first heard of Dr. Alexander's near-death experiences that I waited quite impatiently for the release of his book. And as much as I cherish this book and it has become one of my favorite possessions I was a little disappointed with the detail in the description of his experiences in the after life and especially in the \\"Core\\". I recognize that it is a process for Dr. Alexander and I really hope that as time goes on his recollection of his amazing journey improves and he will be obliged to put pen to paper again and produce another magnificent book. I am a fan, and I believe his experiences and I look forward to his future works.
B0076DELIG|5.0|love love love harry bosch. i feel like he is real. all of connelly's book bring harry to life. as usual he will keep you coming back for more
0896898288|5.0|I confess I am a newbie quilter so I may not know enough to know any different. What I did read today, after I opened the CD and save the patterns to my computer, was the basic information on how to cut out and sew various quilt blocks. As I am a newbie, and I am not locked into conventional quilt techniques (this may be a bad thing ***smile***) I plan to print out some quilt templates and attempt to sew some sample quilt blocks. If I like what I see, I will continue to work on sewing together quilt blocks and piece together a quilt top.<br /><br />I had no problems reading and understanding the brief quilt sewing directions given towards the back of the book. I had no problems either opening the enclosed CD and saving the patterns to a folder on my computer desktop.<br /><br />For now I am recommending this book. I will update this review, if needed.<br /><br />Recommend.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a must read. I really enjoyed it! Once I started I couldn't put it down. I read all three book in less than a week
B003WKOU0G|5.0|I recommended this movie to every friend that is a parent/works with kids. After they watched it,I've noticed different people take away different things from this movie, so it's very open to interpretation. My daughter was five when we watched it together, and we had a great dialogue afterward. Basically, it takes four different babies growing up in different cultures: San Fransisco, CA, Namibia, Mongolia, & Tokyo..and follows them from birth to age one. It's incredible getting to see the differences in child rearing, and some of the categories you'll be able to compare are: birthing process, feedings, play/toys, child/parent bond, discipline, cleanliness/homes. Since I live in America, I was most interested in the Namibia culture and Mongolia cause they were pretty different. That little Namibian baby's the happiest one in the lot and has virtually no material wealth..but it's pretty priceless that he is always near his mom! What an amazing film to watch if one's interested in cultures and child development, or just cute babies!! If you like this movie, I recommend: [[ASIN:156512958X How Eskimos Keep Their Babies Warm: And Other Adventures in Parenting (from Argentina to Tanzania and everywhere in between)]]
0671891634|5.0|This guy is a good writer. I felt like I was in a coffee shop with him and he was giving me all his attention. He is a down to earth guy with a lot of common sense.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|It was a great gift made a big hit, just not my type of music, but several other people just loved it.
B003Z6YM5U|5.0|My husband is an avid fan of the ALIEN anthology series. That is of course aside from the fact that he fancies Sigourney Weaver. It so happens that his birthday was fast approaching so I thought of the best gift that I could possibly give to him.<br /><br />I found the alien anthology collection and I was so thrilled to realize that I finally knew what to give my husband on his 60th birthday. To make sure that I will have the best gift to give to my husband, I actually read the reviews that I found at the site. Even though not all of them may give a positive review. Most of them do just and that is good enough for me.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|Im in love with her music, the first four songs are stuck in my mind all day. the rest of her album is awesome!
0307279189|4.0|This was one of the more interesting books I've read. I think most people should read this book or one like it. It's a motivator.<br /><br />I gave only four stars for just one reason. I realize that the author was quoting verbatum at times but thought the vulgarity was not necessary to make his point. The author is obviously an excellent writer and I wondered why he could not have spent just a little more time to use better language.
0525952926|4.0|Another great Ken Follett read. He continues his trilogy through the Spanish Civil War and WWII. In some minor things his characters actions and experiences and pretty improbable, but his grasp on the ebb and flow of the history of the period is fairly accurate.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I am a big fan of the show and couldn't wait for season three to begin. The series follows pretty closely to the book.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Fantastic arranging, as always, and the song choices are very smart. Emmanuel and Oh Holy Night are guaranteed to give you chills!
B0083GQKQG|5.0|Tilda Swinton is masterful. The utterly unglamorous anti-heroine that you don't want to identify with because of rather than despite her foibles. If you watch this, which you should, you may well experience the immediate impulse to re-watch it (as I did) because she steals so many scenes that you feel as though there's a lot you must have missed happening in the space beyond her. Swinton is captivating, so expressive and so emotionally real that the movie is instantly, totally gripping. Especially if you liked the book -- although you'll miss a few elements of the book -- and/or if somewhat gritty, more real than ideal (and more real than fantastical) dramas appeal to you, We Need to Talk About Kevin is a movie you must see.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I think we are \\"reachering\\" the end of this series.<br />Another author is doing better stories with this character than this author.<br />(The reference to Puller was funny).<br />This is different than other Reacher novels, as it takes place mostly on the road.<br />The characters are pretty blah, and the story drawn out.<br />There is no romance and no real \\"one against many\\" fights by hand.
B007THA4FI|3.0|This book needed to be pared down considerably in order to give a slice of English life.  The beginning was slow and finishing it a chore.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Fun and easy to play, my grandchildren loved it for a while.  They soon master it and then like a lot of video games get bored with it and want to try something else, but for the price it's worth it.
1451662432|4.0|We sent this to a friend recovering from surgery as a tongue-in-cheek gift. She enjoyed it thoroughly and likely would have under any other circumstances. Highly recommend it as a gift for a friend who can appreciate this bio.
B000SEJHRA|4.0|I bought this for my Kindle because I had lent my paper copy and never saw it again.  This is a go to book for me when I need a laugh.  This is one of my favorite David Sedaris books.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Great cast, great premise for a story - just didn't deliver.  Seemed like they cut out too much ... lots of conflict through most of the movie, then BAM!  problem solved.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It's a cute game. Fun and easy to play SIM game that is also very colorful.<br />The graphics are nice too.
B004VFK5LO|4.0|I love movies touching on or including any of the following: Sigourney Weaver, serial killers, police procedurals, psychological drama and turmoil, unexpected major character deaths, and innovation re: traditional film noir/mysteries. It's a bonus when the movie doesn't feel compelled to toss in a gratuitous romantic scene or two -- and a major bonus if I learn something interesting from the movie. All of the above apply here.<br /><br />This movie isn't brilliant, but it is totally enjoyable. I'm surprised I'd never heard of it and grateful Amazon Instant suggested it to me. It's very interesting, at the very least, and it stays away from most or many of the traditional pitfalls and cliches that mysteries and procedurals slash serial killer movies shamelessly rely on again and again.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I can`t craft on my Kindle Fire! What is wrong? Why is there such little time? But, I like how you added buckets and signs!
B007MNV5WU|4.0|The only problem is that it will delete all your data when you update it. Other than that this app ROCKS! However I do prefer Angry Birds Star Wars over Angry Birds Space.
1582701709|5.0|Is a wonderful book for who is trying to look for answers to change they lives. I recommend it. thanks
B000HF0J36|5.0|DBS is chicken soup for the bad-movie-loving, shark-fascinated, geek-tastic soul. I rewatch this movie with enthusiasm about once a year, maybe twice. It's campy yet seemingly oblivious to its campiness, and it involves so-called super-smart sharks, Alzheimer's research, a sociopathic but attractive scientist who seeks improbable redemption, and a rugged felon with a heart of gold. Most of all, it features Samuel L. Jackson, who is fantastic in this movie.
B008N1V11U|5.0|this game is actually really awesome. the graphics are great and its easy to navigate. I could not put it down..I finished it in a week and was sad. it froze up a few times buy nothing serious. I think ill download spiderman now!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|very good- simple app. good UI and have info you need about your  battery . wish we could change skin too.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|This app works well on the Kindle Fire (original).  I've been able to search easily through the now thousands of TED presentations, find those of interest to me, and save them for viewing when I'm not connected.  This is a great feature for traveling.  Watching the presentations on the Kindle Fire works out very well using this app.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|If you like or liked any/all of Ryan Murphy's projects -- just ignore Glee for the purposes of this review -- then you'll want to tune in to AHS. The first season is available via Amazon Instant Prime, I believe, and the second season is well worth the bargain 1.89 per episode cost of a season pass. It's the return of a neglected genre: the anthology series. I doubted the premise, a series that's recycling actors, as it seems most television actors (especially television actors) play one role over and over for their entire careers. But the actors are all so strong that seeing them returned from season one in an entirely different role is just a thrill, like recognizing an old friend, not a drag. This season, for example, we've got Sarah Paulson, Zachary Quinto (who just SHINES), and Jessica Lange, plus Frances Conroy in cameos.
B000002AGN|5.0|I have owned this for some time and really enjoy listening to the CD's.  Every tune a treat.  However I finally sat down and viewed the DVD  !  WOW Mr Brubeck a man who loved life you can see it in the way he talks about his music. dont miss this
B009K0P10K|4.0|I enjoyed this season. Amanda seems more vulnerable and so do some of the other characters. There are so many twists and turns I wish I had taped the show to re-watch it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider Solitaire via this app is the game I play most on my Kindle Fire (original).  It works quite well with this app.  It will play with the screen in vertical or horizontal orientation.  Undoing one or several moves is simple and intuitive.  And it keeps track of the stats you'd expect to see.  Very much recommended.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I read this well before Flynn's latest book, Gone Girl Gone, took off, and I reread it after finally giving in to the hype about GGG. I liked it to begin with, and I liked it much better than GGG. Both show tremendous imagination and talent, but GGG relies on a sort of sleight of hand, a pretty obvious one at that, and executes remarkably clever, overt manipulation (effective both as a plot device and on the reader). Whereas Sharp Objects and Flynn's other earlier work is full of similarly dark personalities, but they have real soul, truly developed characters existing in a multi-faceted setting and plot. Rather than making them the objects of prestidigitation, Flynn's invested in her characters here and seems to just be letting them live out the personalities she establishes for them when confronted with various obstacles and circumstances (from mundane to exotic). They're real, and they have changing, interesting motives. She's pulled off a curious and brilliant application of the sort of complicated mental disorders or, euphemistically, quirks, that are seldom brought to light much less so vibrantly and plausibly realized in the form of a main character.
B000001G8R|5.0|Abbado made a glowing and exciting recording for Decca of a pair of Mendelssohn symphonies early in his career. That proved to e a very popular record and since then Abbado has made a complete set of the symphonies plus this overture disc for DGG. Those have also proved to be very successful and once more demonstrate Abbado's affinity with the Mendelssohnian world.<br /><br />This very well recorded disc of overtures made from recordings originating from 1985-8, sparkles throughout with lively performances with crisp tempi and neat playing by the LSO. These are generally well-known and popular overtures but there are also two unusual overtures included in this selection. Both are examples of stand-alone overtures which have no link with stage or literary works. They may therefore be considered an early foretaste of the concert overture to be developed further by following composers, mostly in the Romantic or Nationalist periods of music.<br /><br />In this case the two relatively unfamiliar overtures are the Overture for Wind Instruments (* see insert below and comment1) and the Trumpet Overture. Both show Mendelssohn's naturally lyrical style of writing and are enjoyable enough but their relative rarity is not an altogether surprising thing given the greater attractiveness and pictorial advantages of the other overtures on this disc.<br /><br />............................<br /><br />*As I was an orchestral player, I am indebted to William Hollin for the following comment .....<br />'If you play in Bands, the Overture for Harmoniemusik (Band) is anything BUT a rarity. Being one of the BEST examples of classical wind band music, it is programmed quite frequently by fine HS groups and just about every major University Band or Wind Ensemble one can think of. Similar music by the (just barely) generational French revolutionaries i.e. Catel, Mehul, and Gossec doesn't hold a candle to this work. Come to think of it, if it isn't a transcription, neither do the wind band works by the classical period \\"Masters.\\" You can't count the Mozart Serenade as it is much more a large chamber work than a \\"Band\\" work. Finally, Abaddo's choice of tempo for the Andante in this work IMHO drags needlessly.'<br /><br />............................<br /><br />This then is a most enjoyable collection of the known and not so known Mendelssohn. All the overtures are very well played and recorded. I would suggest that purchasers should give this disc serious consideration therefore as the degree of sparkle it offers is rather more than several other collections of Mendelssohn overtures made by respected conductors.orks by the classical period \\"Masters.\\" You can't count the Mozart Serenade as it is much more a large chamber work than a \\"Band\\" work.

I've been a loyal reader ever since the first time I picked up a copy of Hunt for the Red October, buying and reading every subsequent Tom Clancy novel. Some were definitely better than others, some dragged on and took some time to read and get through. However, reading Threat Vector reminded me of the time I first read Hunt for the Red October. It kept me on the edge of my seat, not letting me put it down, even late into the night. The characters came alive on the page and you could feel yourself staring at the same computer screen that Jack Ryan, Jr., Ding, Dom, and others were looking at, just as you could feel yourself in the submarine with Jack Ryan Senior staring down at the cook who was trying to set off a missile. Threat Vector is now one of my favorite Tom Clancy novels.<br /><br />If you decide to read it - allocate some time, because you'll find yourself at 4 a.m. still gripping the book, not able to put it down. Great read!
B009GESJH2|5.0|Frankly, if you did not previously like Kid Rock, then you still will not.<br /><br />This album is a continuation of the blend of rock, country, funk, and a bit of soul.  There is a purposeful slant towards rock 'n roll.  Remember what that is?  Before grunge and other self-pitying emo's, there was music that did not whine and suck.<br /><br />As KR has professed for a long-time, if it is real, you'll feel it.  The largely biographical content of each KR album creates a tangible sincerity.  I appreciate folks that perform songs that they wrote.
B008N1V11U|5.0|this game is awesome and I love to play it.......I wish it had everything from the movie in this game. I love this game.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I give this book a five because this book reaches your heart and you almost believe that the dog can talk. Very well written, very well thought out theme.  Dogs truly are a man's best friend. A dog loves without conditions and that is the best kind of love. I would recommend this book to all dog lovers in the world. Mr. Stein, well done!!!!!!!!!
B0084IG8TM|1.0|for those of you that think this was a good movie SHAME ON YOU. This movie was not anything worth its time I am shooting from the hip I just watched it it and not worth anytime or mnoney
B007EE564U|4.0|If you are a Mitch Rapp fan you will enjoy this latest thriller from Vince Flynn. Good fast action with a few twists.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|think i've worn out the cd player in the two weeks i've owned this; haunting lyrics, great horns, great piano riffs.  in other words standard steely dan stuff!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was such a sweet story. I loved the way the story was told and the personality of the \\"narrator.\\" There are several points of wisdom that can be learned from this book; I encourage you to give it a try. Fair warning though, tissues may be necessary throughout the book. They were for me at least, but maybe I'm just very empathetic.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|Just not up to the typical Pixar standard.  Beautiful animation but VERY disappointing story.  I'm sure it appeals to children but adults will find it lacking.  Not nearly on the same level as past movies (Toy Story trilogy, Up, etc).  Here's hoping they bounce back!
B008EK91XU|4.0|I was very moved by Ian's totally honest and up front description of his life.  A man with great depth and an ambition to help others less fortunate.  You don't have to agree with everything but I admire his commitment to the things he believes in.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Was interested in this one and loved it.  I will watch this more then once.  Movie came in a timely maner.
B007V65R54|5.0|There are so many places in this book where I learned some important insight, that I was very impressed. The book starts out with Nate's expertise, Baseball and Politics but goes into predicting so much more. The section on climate change is a great explanation of what we do and do not know.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|The most amazing TV series that i have ever come across. Awesome mix of fantasy, drama, plots, twists and intricate characters. A must watch.
0307951529|3.0|its ok, ....same as alot of this genre of books....nothing earth-shaking here...sort of a waste of money imo.  oh well...a sucker born every minute...right???
B000P0J0AQ|4.0|Completed our Matrix collection and we are very satifided with the movie.  Movie was a great price and came within a timely maner.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Zombie apocalypse is on its way...buy as many guns as you can stockpile food and revolt against tyranny. Your kids future depends on it.
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|christmas gift not used as yet  looks like it will bev fun for the family  I bought it for grandson..
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I bought this because I heard a couple of songs on it that I liked.  To my pleasant surprise:  I love every song on it!  That doesn't happen very often!!!
B005MVJM3I|5.0|Typical Machine Head.  Whole album is good to listen to.  My favorite MH album is the more things change.  Although not as good as that, this album is some good classic Machine Head
0060254920|5.0|This is a classic that I got for my grandson.  A beautiful book came.  It will be under the tree for christmas
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love that it's simple and easy to use. I can just sit down and play and easily loose an hour.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|I love them so much just keeps getting better and better . Cannot wait until Take Me Home tour! :)
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|The whole family loved it. My six year old finished it first with a little help now and again. We would happily buy the sequel too.
0375869026|5.0|I read this with my 10 year old nephew who has a friend who has some facial burns. It is a really good book. Some great life lessons and teaches anyone of any age that your inner beauty is really what counts!
B007MAETA8|5.0|John Mayer seems that he could do no wrong, he's got so much great stuff. And I'm lucky enough to have lots of it !!!
0525953728|5.0|This book is great it goes into detail about 'MARK OWENS' life also about Buds training and many other things i read this book in about 5 days i couldn't put it down i am senior in high school in class i would read this this influenced me to join the military and hopefully be in the special operations community loved the book my favorite book i have ever read
B006LSZECO|5.0|I've read only a quarter of the book thus far, but at this point I can't stop reading.  Learning the perspectives of each of the major characters puts an added twist to this mystery.  In the midst of wondering where Amy is, I see how the relationship declines on one side and improves on the other.  Interesting approach to this story.
B001VLXNLU|4.0|This was a wonderful beginning to this series.  It definitely makes you want to read the rest of the series.  It also makes you want to have a vampire mark you so you can attend this school and find a cute and sensitive guy like Erik.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|Neil has gone back to his roots or so it would seem. This is a really good CD. Worth the listen !!!
B007HU7NBK|2.0|John (Nigel) took the time to let us all know a couple of things about himself.  The first that he's extremely egotistical & the second that he's a spoiled brat.  Name dropping throughout as a substitute for substance, likening his alcoholism to an illness that is entirely out of one's control (a defective gene!) such as cancer & not taking the responsibility for his lack of self control didn't endear him to the reader.  As a teenager I was not a big fan of DD & now I can see why: they targeted the Smash hits & Jackie reading 12 - 14 year old school girls & his book is really still pitched to those now forty-somethings.
1611761565|4.0|A well written and informative account of life as a Navy S.E.A.L.  Also a fascinating look at the politics and military expertise involved in tracking and killing Bin Laden.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|What can I say, I've loved this movie for many years but never owned it and now I can watch it whenever I like. Audrey Hepburn is amazing in this movie, she's so soft and gentle, they really did cast the right actor for this role, I absolutely love it and it's the sort of movie you can watch over and over especially on a rainy day.
B00008CLOA|5.0|This is a great album to have been put on SACD in 5.1. It's just AWESOME definitly worth the wait and worth owning.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Dexter is simply one of the best shows on television. The story is great, the actors are great, and each season seems to get better and better
B008XG1X18|5.0|it is an great app. if you don't have this yet then your living in the stone age. give it a try
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I like to read the reviews before buying books for my Kindle.  The reviews of 50 Shades had me crying tears of laughter! Thank you to all who wrote those witty and humorous editorals; I needed a good laugh. Thank you for saving me some money too, I am not going to buy or read this series. I think the reviews themselves should be published!
B008458O3S|3.0|The game is a puzzle game with increasing difficulty and new challenges with every level. it is a very nice game but it is very laggy on my Samsung Vibrant. I have to pull the batteries out in order to restart my phone more than once after I start this game because it will just freeze. Some times I will start the level and nothing will move for few seconds then suddenly all the trains have jumped to the end or crashed and I did not see what happened.<br />I will give it 5 stars if it was smooth and does not crash.
B004EPZ06G|1.0|I was a huge fan of the first movie. I must have seen it in the theaters 4-5 times. When I heard there was going to be a second (and third and fourth) movie made I was very excited. This movie just didn't compare. As many people had said before me, the humor/jokes/plot points were all recycled from the first movie. That isn't my main complaint though. The jokes in the first movie seemed natural and just flowed. In this movie they really felt scripted and you could really tell they were TRYING to be funny. I just couldn't enjoy it.
B000ID1J5E|5.0|I enjoyed watching the movie.  It's a good show that can be watched by the entire family.  There is a lot of action and it always keeps you wondering what will happen next.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is a great new novel by Grisham.  It kept me in suspense until the very last page.  An excellent read.  Very intriguing.
B009JBWOU0|4.0|I feel kinda silly for buying the dvd version instead of Blu-ray since I didnt notice the dvd version doesnt have any of the special features. I guess ill give this set as a gift and buy the Blu-ray copy.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|better than the first book...keeps your interest...not too much kinky sex... can't wait for the next book to come out
B0036BK6MW|4.0|This DVD was purchased to be a gift so I did not open the actual package. Great movie at a great price.
1615470158|3.0|Nice intro and overview<br />Actually I was expecting much more of realistic examples (like the one with buget-actual comparison)<br />But it did give me some ideas
B008LY9AWG|4.0|Another great Harry Bosch tale. Typically \\"gotcha from the first page\\" Connelly writing. I love him and Harry. Can hardly wait to get the rest of the book.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another Vince Flynn Masterpiece!!! Mitch Rapp is back and as good as ever. Non-stop action and suspense. A real page turner!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This just like the pc ver but cant go yo the nether or get lava etc. This is a really awesome game just get persuade your parents to get it!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love it. Only way we can watch the show without cable or satellite. Streaming through amazon is even high quality.
B005RUV0NY|5.0|This is really an xcellent show!!! Each episode will keep you on the edge of your seat. A must watch.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|This is a great movie.  It helps people understand, somewhat, the plight of the Native Americans and how they (especially their women) were treated.  I think Daniel Day Lewis was great in this movie. He is not feigning to be Native American in this film, (just in case you haven't read the book) but he pulls of the character well.  I won't spoil the ending, but, as you know, love conquers all.  Watch it.  It was free with my Amazon Prime.
B0055B7IPE|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, it was very cute.  Even for grown up kids.  I would recommend it for someone wanting to smile a little.
B007U1FEJE|2.0|Great harmonies as usual but very disappointing on the whole. I expected something new and fresh but the guys sounded very tired. Maybe they should retire or do some old standards like Rod Stewart has done.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|Broad-based reviews of hotels, restaurants. Quite helpful in planning entertainment/vacations.  You can also contribute yourself.  Overall, a good travel companion
B005XOPEOU|4.0|Their first couple of albums were more collage dorm love songs.. very slow low tone. The newer albums are a bit faster and more joyful. Something that could prepare you for a weekend. X M is pretty good. Shorter than I hoped for though.
B00881VLCE|5.0|can do over 200 pieces. very addicting. good for car rides or just sitting at home and enjoying piece and quiet.
B007EE564U|5.0|Then this book is a must read.  I've read all of Vince Flynn's books and this one is a cracker.  In fact It's close to my favourite.<br />It takes you on a fast ride, has twists and turns and action a-plenty. I couldn't put it down.<br />All your favourite characters from previous Rapp books make an appearance so you immediately feel like you've stepped back into their world.<br />Buy it if you love adrenaline-fueled reading.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Good visuals, and varied settings for playing against the computer.  Nothing exceptional but good for what it is is is.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The feed will not download beyond the first 10 or so posts.... after that it turns blue becomes misformatted and won't load. It's very annoying and very common from what I have read. It appears to be an ongoing problem that hasn't been addressed...
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It always lets me know when I need to charge my kindle and very satisfied. It has made things easier.
1419705849|5.0|Our 9 year old would bring it to school to read in his spare time.  He is looking forward to the next.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|There is not much to the game, but it is addictive and lots of fun to play. Level after level of fun!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I am not a huge book reader, but I really wanted to hear this story.  I think this book would be a great read for all types of individuals, this book was such an easy and quick read.  The author and SEAL did a great job on not only describing the Bin Laden raid, but also his life and journey as a Navy SEAL and what it took him to get to that final Bin Laden mission. He chronicles his life as a SEAL discussing training, some missions and about how life as a Navy SEAL really is.  The book transitions back and fort from the actually Bin Laden mission to his life growing up and as a SEAL.<br /><br />I know that before I read the book many people said this book was political, told military secrets / tactics, and that he was an ego maniac.  I would totally disagree, I thought he told a well balanced story that gave enough details about how a Navy SEAL teams operate without divulging anything I would consider secret.<br /><br />Political Book??? He mentioned Obama I think once or twice and although I would say he was not a supporter of Obama, he respected him and the decision to green light the mission.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone.  Well balanced, fast paced, a great look into a SEALs life and the Bin Laden raid.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I got this cover for 3 times the price last year. This price is great!  It a fabulous looking cover that offers great protection.  Just bought it again in different color.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|I admire Christopher Nolan's style he has a real eye for detail but this movie was very slow and sluggish with underdeveloped characters and a plot that didn't make a ounce of sense to me at all lol it continues 8 years after The Dark Knight film kind of like in the graphic novel The Dark Knight Returns when Batman makes a comeback after a 10 year retirement from crime fighting Tom Hardy did an excellent job as the villain Bane but Anne Hathaway was weak as Catwoman she's a good actress but they gave her absolutely nothing to work with and Christian Bale does his normal growling and grunting as the Caped Crusader we all know that Batman is a world class detective and investigator but Bale makes Batman look and sound like a caveman instead also the movie is almost 3 hours long and Bale was only in the Batman suit for maybe 15 or 20 minutes somehow I feel like they didn't really know how to end the trilogy so they just put a whole lot of BS together I'm surprised that this film made over 1,000,000,000 dollars worldwide.
1400067820|2.0|Long gamma, negative theta and long vega is the impossible theoretical prescription Taleb seems to make for the world today. The problem is it doesn't exist in practice portfolio trading or real world very often if at all. There will always be vega risk and only neutrality where we take additional exposure and put more weight on our prediction or trade.<br /><br />I listened to the entire Audible book and a recording of the lecture at the LSE and I'm left with the feeling Taleb has a lack of respect for theta or your time.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I downloaded this for my kindle to open .rar files, and it works beautifully. It helps me organize as well.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Well written and capturing story. Difficult to put down and keeps you on edge at every page! Highly recommended for leisure reading .
B009MF56GC|2.0|The plot was terrible the acting was cheesy and the action was funny and corny the only reason I give it too stars because it was cool to see all the old action heroes in one movie the final fight will have you laughing all night long I wonder how much money did they pay Chuck Norris to appear in this film?
B003YUQ71E|5.0|i simply loved it, it is true to size, the shoe is light and comfortable, you will get exactly what is shown in the pictures given
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Excelente libro, de esos que tienes que tener siempre a la mano para saber cómo hablar el lenguaje de amor de tu cónyuge.
B0041OOEJY|4.0|Good movie for family with pre-teens.  Better than the original with good dialogue, character development, action scenes, and just plain fun
B007HU7NBK|4.0|Book was very good. A real page turner for Duran fans. Would have liked a little more detail about how the songs originated. I would highly recommend this book.
B007REV4YI|4.0|The best Bond movie in the last 50 years. A model for all Bond movies to come. Two great spoilers alerts, but you'll have to see the movie to know them.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This app is very fun, however coins don't last long enough. Very frustrating to be forced out of game posy unless you make a purchase. Aldo, the wait time for coin accumulation is way too long.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|So hooked on this!! I am currently on level 172...I have no idea just hoow many levels there even are!
B007N8RULO|5.0|this is a great game. I play it all the time over and over. the game works really really great.
1400067820|1.0|Taleb's spectacular success in coining words and phrases rests on a massive pool of unconsidering humans who are suckers for pathetically thin observations like \\"use it or lose it\\". This reservoir was the topic of Maureen Tkacik's brilliant essay on Taleb's original promoter, Malcolm Gladwell. (Search \\"Gladwell for dummies\\"). And it is not drying up. That might have something to do with a species known as the journalist, perhaps the only sector of society with no training in anything whatsoever who have nothing better to do than humor wafer thin piffle like the following:    \\"Then we get to the idea ... You take a car. You drive it against the wall at a tenth of a mile per hour, a hundred times ...er... or a thousand times. Have you done any harm, no. A tenth of a mile per hour won't harm you. The car will have some damage but it won't harm you. Now, drive the same car once at a hundred miles per hour....\\"    Given the paucity of this type of pre-release discussion, the quality of this book should not surprise. There is not a shred of actionable intelligence to be found.    For a video review:    [...]
B003O86FMW|5.0|This sequel was every bit as engaging as the first book. I liked it very much. It was exciting and kept me reading.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I can't get enough of this show, its awesome. Can't wait until they have another child.<br />keep the show going yahoooooo
0307279189|5.0|Wonderful adventure into natural running still extant in the Copper Canyon MEX - what humans were built to do, how children run barefoot, and how the best athletes in the world run. McDougall travels to the Copper Canyon to meet the indian runners who &#34;just get warmed up running 50 miles&#34;, then convinces the best to travel to USA for competitions.  Also recommend [[ASIN:1934030651 Natural Running by Danny Abshire]] - a how-to book on running technique and training.  I have incorporated the natural running technique into my training and soccer refereeing thereby enhancing my speed and endurance.

B009HQ9UHC|5.0|it has all the fun from angry birds most feared enemy and couldent cave come at a better time.<br />its time for the piggies to have their revenge.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|One of three in a series and they were very interesting reading. Unlike anything else I have read before.  Worth a read for sure.
0307887448|5.0|As a child raised in the 70's and 80's, Cline's depiction of a futuristic society obsessed with the pop culture (and video games!) of that time period made for a story full of familiar things.  However, it was the twists, turns and puzzles within the story that have resulted in me reading twice already and buying 4 copies of it to give as gifts the Christmas.  A fabulous read - I hope he writes more.....
B00992CF6W|5.0|I couldnt expect more from this game but I already had my fun with the basic stuff wandering when is the update coming?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is easy to use, the font is a great size  It does everything that I wanted it to do.
1451695195|5.0|Loved the book!  It's obvious to me that Eben Alexander's chief intent was to share his experience in a genuine and articulate manner because he really wants us to know what it was like.  He seems repeatedly frustrated that there are no human words to communicate and fully explain his grand experience.  Overall I would describe this book as hopeful and honest.  He wants us to know that the universe can be explained by both both science AND spirituality.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|I loved this show and didn't get to watch the whole season because of work.  Very funny.  Love the cupcake business part!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of three in a series and they were very interesting reading. Unlike anything else I have read before.  Worth a read for sure.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved these books...I loved the character deveopment. Skip over the parts you dont like and read the rest. I have to laugh at those who give this book a bad review because its the second book. Gesh you've already read the first book, the author/content is out there...you have to know what its about somewhat.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|I (and my 17 year old daughter) have listened to the CD many times.  It's nice having some of the earlier songs from The Jackson Five included.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|One of three in a series and they were very interesting reading. Unlike anything else I have read before.  Worth a read for sure. Kind of a disappointing end to the trilogy.
B001LF3YQK|4.0|It's always hanging on our pram. The red button was hard to slide at first but over time it became easier to access with one hand. It's never opened accidentally for me and we have been quite rough with it - just don't overfill it. I've had it for over 4 months and loving it. The best thing about it is that each time I need wipes, I never have to dig into the bag! The outside is easy to clean too so even if I have sticky fingers, I can just grab my wipes then wipe the case.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|An easy read.  Read it all practically in one sitting.  I have already recommended it to a few other people.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I hate the ads but what do I expect for free. Easy to play and fun too.  Well worth getting.
B000T433CO|4.0|Things like this don't really happen, but it is fun to watch nice people and good results prevail in spite of life's challenges, which does really happen.  Heart warming.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Don't watch this for the the story. It's just good, mindless, fun time. Great combat, excellent visuals, mad story. Booze might be a better companion than popcorn for this one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Interesting story.  Very close to the movie.  Definitely a very different genre. I think it was worth reading this book.
B00A6X6V4K|5.0|Great album lots of great songs...not sure what the digital book is or how it applies to android phones. Would recommend to everyone that likes KC's music.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|School murders.<br />Rarely is seen the mother's side of the story.<br />In Finland too, where I live, there has been school murders and similar crimes. Many ponder, including politicians, why and how, where and when did our societies let the families down.<br />This book is a step closer to understanding and maybe being able to take helping steps.<br /><br />The movie made from that book is in my opinion a rare case of a great adaptation to screen.
B00451VH84|1.0|Since my vcr is still working... And I want my grandchildren to experience the movie the way I did, I will not be purchasing a censored version. I think the censorship diminishes the historic significance of the film. To leave it as is would provide parents the opportunity to have a dialogue with their children about any questions. Shame on Disney for not preserving the original or at least making it available to those who have enough sense to look beyond 'correctness'.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|For anyone who is a dog lover and even those who aren't! Happy,sad,and easy to read! Couldn't put this one down!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The last book of the saga exists as there should be an end where the good ones win over the bad ones (this is an american story after all). But the story drags on and the stamina of the plot and the writing  has been all used in the first two volumes. I forced myself to the end... just because I wanted to know how the good ones would win, not so much because I would have enjoyed the reading...
B003O86FMW|4.0|Not quite finished but the seeming fall of this dictatorship keeps me interested. Easy going reading but not a book that will be remembered after this era.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|I like this app because it so much easier.<br />I would recommend this app to other people that read this review.
B008AX18Y6|1.0|I can not understand how this book got so many brilliant reviews from critics.<br /><br />Yes, Salman Rushdie (S.R.) and the Satanic Verses have been and still are a very important stand about freedom of speech and have also served to point out the rise of extreme islamism. That can not be denied. But this book, written from his journal, is not in any way a good read. It also will not make you like it's author, be warned.<br /><br />1) There is no guiding thread to the story except chronology, as if he has been sitting at his desk looking each page at its turn and then telling us: &#34;today this happened&#34;, and the following day &#34;today this happened&#34;... it is quite boring.<br /><br />2) There is so much name dropping it is impossible to know which are the names you should pay attention to (who will turn out to be important characters to follow up in the development of the story,  which ones are just passing by?) I started to get the feeling he mentioned them so that-you-know-that-he-knows-all-these-more-or-less-famous-people-that-you-poor normal-reader-don't-know, argh....<br /><br />3) Why write your own story with the &#34;he&#34; pronoun? Kings and Napoleon-sorts used to speak about themselves like this... I found that deliberate choice profoundly unpleasant.<br /><br />3) Somehow the idea of fear, secrecy, the weight of having to live as a recluse was quite poorly conveyed: I could read the words he writes about it, but the feeling were not carried to me, I could not even feel sorry nor worry for him, even though I do not side in anyway with anyone who would say he deserved it, far from it . I would have expected more from an acclaimed writer.<br /><br />4) And about his relationships? S.R. writes about them in a way that puts him in a light of glory when he has to help ex-wives/girlfriends but he seems to be unable to be other than selfish and spoilt when he is within the relationship. I guess he is probably honest about this... Who would want to paint oneself in that way..? I would suggest anyone considering being in a relationship with him to read his book and think twice, one might be disposed of.<br /><br />To me this book gave the idea that S.R. became a defender of free speech completely by accident, but the person behind the role is, after all, quite small.<br />What a disappointment.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Excellent read... Book two continues the story of several vibrant characters that you would really like to know. Sad, in places but keeps the saga real. Can't wait for book three.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Lots of subplots to juggle, some with confusing time lines, but in the main this was a non-stop read. Johnson put me in North Korea. I could see the characters, understand the relentless terror that numbs and defeats nearly all of them. Genius interspersing of North Korean propaganda tools in the story, particularly the loudspeakers. Laugh-out-loud absurdities, followed by chilling barbarity. Not crazy about the ending - hence four stars instead of five - but this is first rate storytelling.
B003O86FMW|2.0|The follow up to the saga, same place, same people, different story.<br /><br />Always good to know what our teenagers are reading.<br />And of course a nice 1984-touch to the story.
B008M87GJK|4.0|Comprehensive and reasonably unbiased in most areas.I especially like the coverage of American domestic affairs even though they do tend to be in lock step with U.S. foreign policy
B0015DYIH2|4.0|All I can say is, if you love the other you'll love this one too! This book us just what I wanted it to be like. That's all I can say because I don't want to add spoil the book.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The issues that are addresses in this story are interesting and can make our teenagers think about issues of autocracy, democracy and wrongful use of power. The plot is well put together and the reading compelling. Good read.
B00A0SQBDM|1.0|Hate it! It would not open after I downloaded it. Would got high stars if I could. If get it fixed I know I would have loved it.
B004KNM3EY|5.0|Bought this CD the day it came out along with all 5 CD singles from this CD.<br /><br />The B-Sides are INCREDIBLE.  Yes, Incredible.<br /><br />This CD is in my top 5 favorite of all-time.<br /><br />Suede are known for producing B-sides as good  (if not better than the album tracks)...In fact they collected these on Sci-Fi Lullabies (a 2 CD set of B-sides).<br /><br />Most hard core fans say Dog is their best....not at all.  I'm about as hard core as they come.  This CD is their masterpiece.<br /><br />I dare anyone to give this CD 2 complete listens, extra tracks and all ( their B-sides are better than the actual album).<br /><br />I've listened to this CD about 1,000 times and never tire of it.<br /><br />Stand outs:  Trash, Beautiful Ones, She, Chemistry Between Us.<br />THE B-SIDES ARE AWESOME.  Trust me on this.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Impressive through every moment! An absolute must have movie for all ages! Get 2 copies so you can give a fabulous gift and keep one for yourself.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|not only two levels<br />uahbababsbabsbs<br />ajsjsjsjsjsjsjsnsnnsnsnzns sjsjsjsnsnsnsnsnsnsns sjsj shs shs shs. abs sjs abs ah whs h's J's J's sb wjww ab sb
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game, you really must think to figure it out!  Great game for free!  Just try it, you'll love it.
B0058YPL66|5.0|Good show. Didn't think I'd like it, but it wasn't bad. . . . . . . .. . . .
B004CEUEWE|5.0|What amazing performances!  Jeremy Renner's Jem was amazing and truly deserving of his Oscar nomination.  Ben Affleck shines both as a director and actor.  It's a must see!!
B009WO7NQO|3.0|The levels are great, but Dagobah and Hoth are  real ripoffs, especially Dagobah. Just to get more levels, you have to pay $2.00. I am a huge Star Wars fan, and this was a complete disappointment. My six year old brother is addicted to it though.... :-)
B008Y7045C|5.0|One of my favorites and not just because I like Johnny Depp.  I like movies that have a strong female part and this one doesn't disappoint me.  I watch it over and over
B000JPDJUY|4.0|Good movie - fun to watch a couple of today's Avengers in their past roles.  Some unbeleivable action at the end, but it was a fun ride.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This game is addicting, and it's easy to play all day. If you are a rookie in this game, BEWARE of original mode (the watermelon), for it is hard!!! I have played for a year and STILL can't do it. Otherwise, it's fun!!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I couldn't put it down and hated for it to end.  Can't wait for the next book to come out.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|I loved the first three Bourne movies and thought that this movie did a very good job of expanding the Bourne universe.  A lot of people / critics didn't seem to understand the interplay between the first three movies and this one, but my view is that they just didn't pay attention.  The movie isn't supposed to be easy to understand - it's one of those movies that you need to see a few times.  Anyway, I recommend at least watching the third Bourne movie before watching this one, and then just sit back and enjoy the ride...
B008MEM24S|1.0|This game is not my favorite. The levels are brain-frying. The only way to get more levels is to gets more gnomes, which is (in my opinion) a horror show. If there were a zero-stars setting, I would use it to describe this game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The whole family loves this game. It has great graphics and is easy for the little ones to play. Very addictive!
B0030MM68O|5.0|When The Hurt Locker first came out, I was afraid to see it because I had heard how intense it was and just didn't need the stress.  However...after seeing Jeremy Renner in his many hits of 2012, I decided it was time to watch The Hurt Locker.  WHAT AN AMAZING MOVIE!!  No politics, just a heart wrenching view of what IED soldiers face on a daily basis.  I highly recommend it!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is great! Young kids will delight watching that adorable Om Nom emotionally react to whatever happens, and older kids will get a great mental workout with the physic-based levels.
B00AK7GQJ2|1.0|I want my money back! I DID NOT PAY FOR 16 seconds of commercials before the show or 2 min of commercials after! Your commercials eat up the limited internet usage that I have way out here in the country. I DID love amazon vidoes when it first came out and I have been a VERY loyal customer, and how have I gotten re-paid? By Amazon sneaking in commercials that I DON'T WANT TO WATCH and I PAID so that I would not have to watch!!!! STOP the commercials or start loosing customers!!!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Absolutely terrific starting volume to The Walking Dead, well worth the money.  I really can't wait to read even more!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I played all the other updates, and compared to the others, this sucks. I went to write this, and I saw the &quot;update&quot; button. So I clicked it, and I'm hoping it's going to be better. I'll write another later. P.S.: If you are about to buy this app, here's a simple tip. BEWARE of Piglantis. It is so hard! :-(  Otherwise, the levels are good for beginners.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|great game. it does get get boring after a while. its a great time passer.  so all in all fun game and its free.
0545265355|1.0|Didn't see the movie, but people say it is better than the book.  Read 2 1/2 of the books before I quit.  Poorly written and stupid story line; maybe if I was 12 or 13 I would have been entertained.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is amazing but I think you need to add large chests and a better way to light tnt like add Redstone torches
0307593312|5.0|This is up there with the greatest books ever written; I am in awe in wondering how the Japanese version could be  translated to English and still maintain the beauty of the language submitted in every paragraph.  You will not be disappointed in this beautiful piece of work.
1475143389|5.0|I have been working out for 20 years and have tried everything from Tae Bo to P90X. After I read this book I finally started leaning out and gaining muscle at the same time. I would recommend this book to anyone at any age. It is very easy to read and the workouts are awesome. The eating program is so easy to manage and the book gives a great formula for several fitness goals. I would definitely recommend this book and I just ordered the author's other books, The Shredded Chef and 50 Muscle Myths. Can't wait to read them.
B0049VZ222|3.0|I had high hopes going into The Walking Dead but I was disappointed.  I watched the whole first and second seasons.  It was ok, but not great.  The main problem is that it's so hollywoodized and cliché in terms of emotions, acting, and plots.  It suffers from having very simple plots and nearly zero political or artistic relevance.  It just doesn't appeal to me as much as Game of Thrones, True Blood, Star Trek, and other series that seem to attract the best and brightest artists, designers, and writers by using fantasy as a means of addressing controversial issues from a metaphorical distance.
B00A6PD8RQ|2.0|Not Pixar's best work.  Story takes a very bizarre turn and frankly I just didn't enjoy it very much.  Not the worst movie ever but I'll never watch it again.
B00005U152|5.0|Love this story and it is a really young Anthony Quinn. If you love old film you will love this one.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed weaving in and out of the lives in this book, it kept me guessing until the very end...well worth the price.
B009LRE040|5.0|I was really reluctant to see this movie.  I thought the 2nd one was way too dark.  This one was great because it tied everything together and was not too dark.  The actors were fantastic.  The story was fantastic. If you have been waiting and wondering if this film is worth the $$, get it or rent it.  I was thoroughly surprised.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I'm not really able to rate this movie just yet as it won't be available until February 2013.  If it is anywhere as good as Season 1 and 2 I'm sure it will be awesome.  Great actors. Mostly serious mixed with some humor.  Once you watch Seasons 1 & 2 you will be hooked.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Use it all the time. you can change how the large are small the text is just by tappin it twice and it still will fit on the page. no accidental turning the page when i only wanted to read the last bit of a sentence. much better than the built in pdf reader on the kindle fire.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|A must see movie.  Based on the poor treatment of blacks circa 1950s.  Even though the movie has serious subject matter there is alot of humor injected throughout the plot.  Great cast and acting.  Highly recommended.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like this and haven't had to look for another weather app. I really like how it shows u by hour and shows the temperature and then how it would feel outside. living in oklahoma with all the wind, that's good info.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Bought this for a gift.  Had previously received recommendations from several people.  Great acting, mostly serious plot mixed with some humor.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is well designed with nice choices for solitaire. The play is continuous and easy to manage. I enjoy playing.
B00000JZIK|5.0|I'm a big Kevin Spacey fan.  This is a who done it movie and it keeps you guessing right until the end.  I bought it as a gift this time.
B001GMQALY|4.0|I just wanted to see Mickey Rourke when he was absolutely the sexiest man alive.  I have this on tape also, but it was good watching it on the Kindle Fire.
B00866JL96|4.0|Love story.  Fairly touching.  Happy ending.  Good acting.  Bought it as a gift for someone that is more of a romantic than I am.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I look forward each week for this show.  It's intro to so many new characters lately has me confused but still interested.
B000066AXC|5.0|I'm a Russell Crowe fan but I think this movie was one of my favorites.  Warm, touching.  I bought it as a gift this time.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Definitely my favorite show on the TV!!!!!!!!!  The acting is wonderful.  I hate to see the season end, but will look forward to next year.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Awesome movie with Sandra Bullock.  Based on a true story.  A mom (Sandra Bullock) adopts a teenage man that had had a hard life.  She incorporates him nicely into her family and helps build his character and confidence.  Great acting.  A feel good movie.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|i got this app the first day i got my kindle fire last christmas. it is amazing! i love the cool options like color pencil, crayon, and paint! worth the money
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I recommend this to anyone who wants to spend time entertaining with family members, I like it that it shows family values, respect to elders , kindness to the young.<br />I like the easy mood of the told story , without all the hype and stress, also great actors who play their respective parts with excellence.
B0077EBWVI|1.0|There are no redeeming qualities of this movie.  They used the same script, same setting, same technology; heck, they used the same dance moves, and the same vw beetle!  The only change in this movie, except for a few minor bits and pieces, is the sub par actors!  Wow.  I have never written a scathing review, and this is more time than I have to spare spent on this type of activity, but I am so disappointed.
B004ZN9J0K|4.0|What I found fascinating about his lp was how the cover art totally described the music. I bought this in 1969 shortly after it's release when this kind of music was new to the listening public. Since I always had a taste for the bizarre, the song titles and spacey melodies suited me just fine. My favorites are Let There Be More Light, Set the Controls, and the title track. They achieved what other artists did not do until years later, and all without synthesizers. Truly a milestone in space rock!
B003006WRC|4.0|A very interesting take on our healthcare system. It's good to know how other countries take care of their people. I realize no system is perfect so I'm not saying other countries are better or not as good as the U.S., but this film is  definitely interesting. I would recommend it to anyone interested in healthcare system issues in this country.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is fast paced and loads of fun! I only wish we earned more acorns. As for adding friends I wouldn't'know who they are, where they're from or if they'd be able to access or hack my kindle.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|The cast was superb.  The story shows how a group of elderly people react to problems of growing older and also plays up the problems of socialized medicine in Great Britain.  They travel to India to stay in the Exotic Marigold Hotel.  The young man who runs the hotel refuses to give up on his dream, and the group help him realize the dream.  Am looking forward to the sequel.  Was able to rent the DVD and enjoyed it so much I bought one for myself.
B000002ADT|5.0|Pure genius. Transports one to another plane; there, alone, you may see. You may not. But. You can always play it again.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Contrary to comments on the third book,  I think this this was a good third for closure of the hunger games
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|It was a great Movie! It is one we will buy for sure now thanks to renting it from Amazon instant video!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|best camera bag. love the different sections that can be customized to fit different things. holds other items in addition to your camera and accessories. I bring this whenever I travel.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This is one of the few movies I can watch over and over.  Sandra Bullock's performance is tremendous. I love it.
B008A1B5Z0|5.0|Does exactly what I want it to do, douche out my kindle fire! I'm verry happy with it! I highly recommend it to all of you kindle fire users out there!
1611761565|5.0|Best book I have listened to to date. Could not put it down. It begins with a teaser and then covers his background on how he got to that point and then of course the actual event. I lost one of the CDs accidentally and was so engaged I immediately ordered a replacement next day air. As frugal as I am that says a lot.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|news feed still unable to load more than a dozen stories (with no workaround such as re-installing or re-launching app). definitely not recommended; try the browser-based mobile website until fixed. poor form to keep this broken app in the app store in my opinion.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Get this game! It has very good graphics and awesome gameplay. It feels like a console game! You will not regret it.
0307895475|5.0|Not disappointed. So much knowledge and so little time to play. If you want to know the secrets of all Skyrim, buy this book. It will blow your mind.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Ordered as christmas present. Sure my fiance is gonna love it. We are big fans of the show.  Got item in very decent time.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|Simply put...a classic tale of three beautiful souls and each questioning if they have chosen the right path for their life and wondering if they should change courses, seeking a more fulfilling life in their latter years; or should they be simply grateful and embrace their life, as it has been.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Love the show, this was purchased for my fiance as a part of his christmas gifts. Now he has the complete series 1 thru 5 and will be purchasing season 6 when it is available
B003QP4BJM|5.0|Excellent book and enjoyable reading - Provides an uplifting experience in light of how things seem so negative and most people seem so pissimisitic today.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|One of my favorite movies!<br />Beautiful acting with a powerful message.<br />Great price and quick shipping -<br />I give this a thumbs up!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I purchased The Panther because I enjoyed The Gate Keeper. DeMille weaves a great plot, developes the characters and puts the reader in each setting..all this with flashes of humor.
B00008438V|5.0|walk down memory lane now our kids like it too and kelly was so pretty in this movie and we laughed really hard
0062101897|5.0|This was a gift...but my 32 year old daughter Loved it and was so happy that I could find it at all....thank you
0061733199|5.0|Not much to say other than awesome. Great tips and advice. Well written including some great illustrations. A must have.
0394826817|5.0|I bought two of these for little toddlers who are learning to speak and are perhaps &#34;spoily&#34; .  There is no substitute for &#34;Please&#34; and &#34;Thank you&#34;  and this book is so clever and fun that these little ones have learned the words and even say them and talk about the book.  Great. (Now if they would spontaneously say Please and Thank You...oh well.  In due time.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is the clock I've always been looking for. This app could teach a gymnist flexability. Wake to the music you wish make it as loud or quiet as you like. Need to catch a few zzz but afraid your too tired to hear the alarm? Be afraid no longer you can make it as easy to turn off as you want or as hard but only till the alarm goes off then you can't change a thing. This is an important asset especually if you have a hard time getting out of bed in the morning. The creators of this app deserve an award cause this is truly a dream app. A must have for anybody who needs to wake up at some point in the day. Easy to use and the ad's are unobtrusive.
B00007FOMP|3.0|I always loved this album, but in the remastering attenuates the emotion driving bass playing of the great James Jamerson. I think that was a critical error because the recording lacks the emotional depth of the original recording. The better buy is the DELUXE version of this album. You get this version and the original version plus a bunch of other cuts on two disks. This one only gives you two bonus cuts.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|Two things I didn't like about the changes made to the swivel sweeper, it no longer has the magnet to hold the base flat to the handle and the dirt tray is not attached to the sweeper. Everything else is great.sweeper.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Great fun read. Perfect for a day in the park or on the beach. If you liked 50 shades you will like this.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed the Hunger Games books a lot more than the movies. Funny how a book let's your mind build a picture as you read while a movie doesn't. All three books are a must read trilogy. Enjoy then everyone!!!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|While still new to me, this app is easy to program and use, even when it is dark. This simplicity is what makes me say, &quot;I like it!&quot;
B007URVZJ6|4.0|For such a short book there is a great deal of information on publishing to the Kindle. Follow the steps in this book to publish your book to Kindle.x
0345803493|5.0|I love the second book even more than the first book.  I cannot believe the great story line to the book; the book is not just about sex.  I cannot wait to read the final book.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|I took the advice of a friend, who said I could download and play Amazon movies on my new tablet.  So I bought this move, which is a favorite of mine, only to find that my tab won't support the system.  I know this is a good movie, but I won't purchase others from Amazon.
0345803507|4.0|I like the book, I just wish there was more to the story.  I don't want the story to end there.  Definitely a page turner.
B008MM9630|5.0|I love fairy farm.it is so awesome.I love it.by the way I am now fourteen. years old.I play it every day.it is so fun.
0394818237|5.0|Richard Scarry books are timeless. They are big, easy to hold, and easy to read to all ages. These are well made and will last through several generations.
B009FB3WQ4|4.0|i enjoyed watching it, and was glad to get it, some of the songs i thought were done not so good..but for the most part overall it was good.. received it in a timely fashion..
0307155102|5.0|Richard Scarry books are timeless. They are big, easy to hold, and easy to read to all ages. These are well made and will last through several generations.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|Fantastic voice!  We have been listening to these over and over...when we put up the tree and started baking cookies.  My favorite is \\"Baby it's Cold Outside\\".  When we were in the car the other day, my daughter broke into a version of \\"Sleigh Ride\\".  Puts a person in the mood for Christmas in a relaxing way!
B005FLX2WC|5.0|I'm so glad i bought this thinking it was a Bonamassa cd. Beth Hart has an outrageous voice and this is a great pairing!
B0050SYS5A|5.0|Nothing but a great product, totally recommended...do no think twice before buying this product since you will not regret it.
0316228532|3.0|Rowling obviously did not intend to paint working class society in UK as a warm and fuzzy bunch, but immediately, in the first chapter, killing off the only individual who seems to have had some warmth or charitable quality, results in a book full of rather unlikable individuals.  None of the long list of characters have any genuine affection for each other, so it is very difficult to root for anyone.  Self distructive, on the road to nowhere, the characters become rather cartoonish, like the Dursley's in 'Harry Potter'.  I would even go as far as to say that her characters are so mean, they are unrealistic.  Life has redeeming aspects to it as well as tragedies, so despite the love of the acerbic, this book disappointed me.  Clearly able to weave a tale, I wish Rowling would break down her wall a little and let us find the heart so I'll want to dive into another one of her books.
0780626966|5.0|Nothing but a great product, totally recommended...do no think twice before buying this product since you will not regret it.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|This movie is another of my favorites growing up.<br />The restoration is practically flawless....the audio is top notch.<br />I have watched this 3 times since I purchased it,and have seen more details that I missed the previous time.<br />If you waited to buy this,wait no longer.
1455527475|3.0|Some interesting observations about Goldman Sachs. However, it was like a constant stream of &#34;wow they expect me to work and make money&#34;! Who would have thought that that would be what it was like working there. It's a lot like a professional football player quiting because he didn't expect that anyone would hit him!
B0084IHVC0|5.0|I grew up with Disney,and I was glad to see Disney tranfering the classics to blu ray.As  always the transfer depends on the person/team making the transfer.<br />This movie transferred very well,and the audio is much better on blu ray.
B000031WBV|5.0|I bought this 30 years ago on vinyl and have heard many other interpretations since then. I re-installed my turntable recently and thus could hear the Nocturnes by Rubinstein again. They are simply the best I have ever heard.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I have seen Pink Floyd several times live over the years.The original members of course.<br />I kind of was disappointed when they lost Roger Waters.<br />I watched a few of the tracks on this DVD on youtube and loved them,so I bought this dvd.<br />This is Pink Floyd on steroids!<br />I did not think Pink Floyd could improve but they did.The music on this dvd is awesome,the show is even better.<br />If your a Pink Floyd fan,BUY this..you will not be disappointed
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I just started the book a few days ago, and I am already so interested in it! I love it so far. It has a cute storyline and everything.
0451228375|5.0|Great historical-type story. Great follow up to &#34; Pillars of the Earth&#34;. Ken Follett is a great story teller with historical perspective which makes the story seem real.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Finally, a movie that portrays true/applicable Christianity.  Please purchase non-bootleg copies to ensure that more movies like this can be made.  Also, I recommend purchasing for all lost family/friends.  They may neglect Christ, but they cannot neglect the realities of a fatherless/Christianless society.
B00961ZGQC|4.0|Good song. The radio stations have been over playing this song recently, but I still enjoy the song. It is one of those fast pace feel good songs that I enjoy.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Received the Hunger Games Trilogy on a loan last Sunday and was unable to put it down. I was fascinated by the characters, and the way they and their world was brought to life. A thoroughly enjoyable read.
B007L6VR6M|4.0|I really love the story and the way Wes Anderson tells it.  It is visiual.  I saw the film in theater and found compelling but knew I would want to watch it again, because visuals are so complex.  I was disappointed with the extras on the Blu-ray.  Usually his films have extensive extras.
B0052YAKS6|5.0|There are so many different kinds of songs that I don't really get tired of it. I love listening to this cd.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Could be better. Would not give me credits when I went to facebook and liked. Not Only that but it did not save my progress. Am interested to see if it gives me credit for this. If not then......delete.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|One of the better CDs released in the recent decades. Every song on the album is decent. Good musicality, lyrics and length. Shinedown produced a masterpiece.
B000HKW7E0|3.0|Bumbling, mis-direction,pratfalls and goofiness: all you'd want in a Christmas tale with this family Good for a laugh and to find your own woopsies.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This season started at a very quick pace, and has not slowed down. There are no episodes of people sitting around rehashing their emotions.  The action sequences are some of the best in the series so far. Watching how other humans are more dangerous than the zombies in a lot of cases makes the series stay fresh.<br /><br />Without going in to the details and spoiling any episodes, there are some flaws and behavior that just doesn't make sense. A lot of it has to do with Michonne (a potentially really cool character that so far is frustrating on how her part is written) and Andrea.<br /><br />Having said that, I can overlook some of the inconsistencies and flaws and am really enjoying the series.
B00003003R|5.0|I have ordered the CD because in a past, when I was teenager I had a cassette with same hits but obviously quality is much better. And it makes me remember all the good times.
B008KE3960|5.0|My energized grandsons love this game and have no trouble spending their alloted 20 minutres playing the games. This was a good one for me to add to my Kindle Fire.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|I have ordered the CD because in a past, when I was teenager I had a cassette with same hits but obviously quality is much better. And it makes me remember all the good times.

B009SQRL4U|4.0|Very fun movie. My hubby and I both ended up watching the whole movie with the kiddos rather than just one of us 'suffering' through a children's movie. Technology and Santa? Sounded silly at first but they did an excellent job of it with this movie. No problems with the instant video steaming rental. Will probably rent it again this season. Enjoy!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun, a bit of a challenge, but not as hard as Free Cell.  I can usually do this in one sitting without getting too frustrated!

B00A7CF1QY|4.0|This movie had me hooked and strapped in for one of the best roller coaster rides in a long while. This addition to the Bourne series films is like the cherry on top of a fantastic ice cream sundae.  I never felt a dry moment in this 2 hour plus length seat grabber.  I recommend this movie to purchase cause you will want to see the insane footage especially in HD.
B000063JZQ|4.0|First off, the man on the cover of this DVD is not Jon Finch as Macbeth.  It is a photo of Martin Shaw as Banquo from the same film.  Why this error in packaging is anyone's guess.  Maybe because it was a rush job - as there are no extras, no commentaries, no nothing accompanying the release of this magnificent but much maligned film.<br /><br />Polanski's take on the Bard is bloody original, outhouse outrageous, darkly comic and visually, viscerally exciting in a way that too few films based on Shakespeare's plays are.  Poetically photographed, concise in conception, visually captivating and for the most part wonderfully acted, this MACBETH grabs on and won't let go until its final gory end - and, actually, not even then.  It lingers.  It lasts.  It is worth the price of admission a hundred times o'er.<br /><br />Some have said that the final clash twixt Macbeth and Macduff is somehow comedic in its cumbersomeness.  They miss the point.  It is supposed to be awkward and silly.  When the beheaded body of the armored Macbeth tumbles down the stairs like a crumpled tin can, it is supposed to be funny, stupid, the way the fate of all who grab viciously for power ultimately is.  Polanski lived through Nazi-occupied Poland - and as evil and destructive as the goose-stepping Germans were, they were also as utterly ridiculous as their mad mentor Herr Hitler. As is Macbeth in this blood-and-thunder telling.<br /><br />Some complain about the nudity.  Why is Lady Macbeth naked in her sleep-walking scene?  Why is the coven of weird sisters naked on Macbeth's second visit to them?  Why not? Nakedness is part of the natural order - but shown here it also emphasizes the psychological states of those bereft of clothes.  Lady Macbeth has lost her sanity - and the absence of clothing merely heightens this vulnerability.  The hag witches are grotesque in their birthday suits as they whip up their disgusting potion which Macbeth then disgustingly drinks - but their hag bodies merely emphasize the dark, dangerous flip-side of Creation itself, mad motherhood in the mire.  The young naked boy bathing - and soon to be bathed in the blood of his killing - touchingly makes us confront innocence in a total, even shocking way that a shot of a cherubic face just couldn't fully convey and command.<br /><br />Some have said that the gore is gratuitous.  It isn't. And even though it may have been somewhat cathartic for Polanski to have made this film (his first after the Manson-mandated murder of his beloved wife Sharon Tate and unborn son Paul Richard) the violence tells a tale within a tale, all its own.  It is a statement about a large part of the way of the world and not in any way excessive for a story as soaked in blood as this one is.<br /><br />The credits of the film, by-the-way, are accompanied by no music but by the sound and fury of a battle, signifying...nothing, as battles mostly do.  And the first person to be seen post-credits is a soldier who approaches one of the fallen enemy.  Realizing the fallen man is still alive, the other beats him down and to death with a spiked ball and chain.  The killer looks very much like Manson at the time of the murders.  I don't think it was an accident on Polanski's part, not at all.  Perhaps just one more way to deal with that with it is ultimately impossible to deal with.<br /><br />If there is anything that might be considered a flaw in the film, it is much of the interior and exterior set-bound lighting.  Some of the courtyard scenes reminded me of the phony exteriors to the Cartwright ranch on BONANZA.  This is such a dark and gloomy film in its essence, that the exteriors seemed to counter this.  But...perhaps that was the effect Polanski wanted to achieve:  a dichotomy twixt the outside and the inside of things.  He may also have been trying to merge film and better-lit theatrical experiences in his take on Shakespeare.<br /><br />Ultimately, however, this version of MACBETH is not a tale told by anidiot.  It is a movie made by a genius.idiot.  It is a movie made by a genius.
B009HELT3C|3.0|This is probably the best MIB in the series.  Great storyline with the addition of new E.T.s that will keep you chuckling throughout the movie.  I will show this movie to my Grandkids this holiday season; I'm sure we will all have a good time.
B0059DL0UC|5.0|I never thought much of pilates, but I find that it's very similar to yoga. I incorporate some of the techniques in my own routine.
B00A0SMTXS|3.0|I think the best part of the movie is the special effects and futuristic technologies.  It is definately helpful to watch the first Total Recall to appreciate some of the twists of scenes.  I would have liked to see a better ending to the story line. Some of the serious emotional scenes had me wondering if the retakes were accidently left in.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I can tell you this much...from the first few pages of the first book I was hooked.  The characters are fabulous and you really get into all of what is going on.  I recommend to everybody!!  I wish more were like this!
0767903811|5.0|I honestly enjoyed this book although I has my biases initially because I stepped out of my genre comfort zone. But the author was hilarious and lots of his complaints--i mean insight--is still valuable.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Fun and fast.  The pages fly by.<br /><br />In life, nothing is as it seems.  Especially not in small town Idaho.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Well-paced, and there is character development everywhere. I like Bale, Caine, Tom Hardy, and Gary Oldman: Caine is noticeable for well-calibrated delivery, and Oldman is noticeable for how natural he seems. I am surprised by Anne Hathaway, who is so good in even the most perfunctory moments of plot exposition that I wondered after each of her scenes if anyone could do that better.<br /><br />So much character development and exposition happens in this movie that it's about to burst. Christopher Nolan stitches it together adeptly. I don't know if it was his choice, but the female voice ullulating on the soundtrack as Batman flies the bomb over the ocean is the only substantial irritant in the whole 2 hours and 45 minutes; time for Hollywood to dump that cliche.<br /><br />The only problem with the film is the sheer number of storylines, expositions, and character arcs: everyone has a story, and something behind that story, and we see it all. I was never bored, but when so much happens in one movie, everything gets run a little fine, and it creates a sort of predictability to the plot elements which seems inevitable if you have only 3 minutes for some of them.<br /><br />Would have been better if fewer storylines were included, giving each more room to breathe?
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I have a hallway in my house that was begging for a light like this to be installed.<br /><br />I've found that all the nightlights I've tried, aren't bright enough AND have to be plugged in. Because of how the hallway is laid out, I knew a light mounted down the hall would be more effective that one that had to be mounted in the middle of it because it needs a plug.<br /><br />I ordered and installed this light a little over a month ago and haven't been the least bit disappointed. I use 4 AA Eneloop rechargeable batteries in it and doubt I will have to recharge them for at least two or three months, quite possibly more.<br /><br />That only caveat about this light, is that the sticky back on it doesn't work and so you're better off mounting it with the included screws or some other means you devise.
0307352145|5.0|Very illuminating, well-written, and informative.  It is as much of a 'page turner' as any good novel.<br /><br />It helps, with the power of clinicial research behind it, to dispel misconceptions and shed light on important erroneous, even destructive, common beliefs.  I highly recommend it for the introverts in your life.<br /><br />And, if you know an extrovert with enough attention span and intellectual curiousity to actually READ a book, they will probably benefit tremendously from this book, as well.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great game to clear your head. Lots of fun and can be addicting too. But hey what's a little harmless bit of addiction right
0979019710|5.0|This is a must must read. After reading this book and putting into practice what Hal writes about, it has gotten me waking up earlier then ever before, and not because I need to but because I want to.

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|If you don't know about this book, there are lots of real photographs in it that help tell the story. I first read it on my e-ink Kindle and really enjoyed the book, but then I went back and looked at the pictures using the Kindle app on my iPhone. The photos were way easier to see.

B0084BMUFA|5.0|Very intriguing, psychological, deep and didactic indeed. Notwithstanding, a lovely and classic story that provokes a thorough reassessment of personal values and human integrity. Dickens's lively narrative and writing mastery would certainly not leave you cold, regardless of your age and social status, allegedly.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had to start this book twice as I found the beginning rather hard-going, but wow, after the thrid chapter, I could hardly put it down.  The plot has so many unexpected twists and turns, I could never guess what would happen next.  It's an intricate web of slightly twisted, very intelligent characters.  The characters are very real and I feel as if I know them well even though I don't know what they're going to do next, well, like real people I suppose.  Fabulous!
1419705849|5.0|My grandson couldn't wait for this to come out and so I bought him the perfect gift. He's 10 years old and loves this series.It was a quick read.Kept him laughing the whole way through.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|It's a Knock off. I compared this case to one that is available at best buy and it is clearly a knock off. The quality of the plastic is completely in inferior to the quality of the plastic from the case you get at Best Buy. There were pieces broken off of the case. I do not recommend purchasing this item
B004LWZWGK|2.0|The bluray disc has a soundtrack flaw.  The sound quality dips down too low and then back up to a reasonable volume over and over through out the movie.  I returned it at Best Buy, exchanged it for another and the second one had the same problem.  Anybody else having this problem.  The DVD has a perfect sound quality.  The bluray sucks!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|if you like bingo you'll love this game, kind of sucks that you have to actually buy cards but if you limit yourself daily they will last.<br />I gave only four stars because a few times the game didn't pay out my winnings, it was like it was stuck.

B007NCSQFO|4.0|I've been a Nicki Minaj fan since 2009 when she started dropping verses on everyone who was anyone's single back then. She definitely established herself as a strong presence in the rap genre, the damn near only visible presence in the female side of rap, and as a force to be reckoned with in the music industry overall after the release of her debut album, \\"Pink Friday.\\" Two things I knew before the album dropped. A. It was going to be even more unhinged, and B. It was going to be more pop. After the amazing, if a bit disturbing performance at the 2012 Grammys, and the release of \\"Starships\\" (which turned out to break the Black Eyed Peas record for longest running top 10 single of all time), I don't understand how anyone could expect anything different. She sings a great deal more on this record than she has previously, which is both good & bad...meaning it's good when it's good, but it does fail at times, particularly when she backs off of the autotune. Perhaps a few more vocal coach sessions, eh? Hey, it helped Rihanna by leaps & bounds. This album is split in half genre wise, with the zany & \\"ratchet\\" rap/r&b cuts heading off the cd, and the dance pop/ballad records finishing the rest of it out. I think that move has largely divided the critics on this one.    1- Roman Holiday 5/5 - I think it should be a pre-requisite to watch the Grammys performance of this before listening to this song. I've heard some critics hail it as the rap version of Bohemian Rhapsody, which is quite a stretch, as that song had much more meaning to it...but this is still quite a theatrical production. She goes between two alter egos here, and though the story is never fully fleshed out, it's just as interesting to hear as Roman's Revenge was.    2- Come On A Cone 5/5 - This is probably one of Nicki's best rap deliveries. With both verses, she builds the animation in her voice until it reaches the chorus, and then she just lets you have it. She addresses critics and haters here, while documenting some of the success she's experienced. There's a bit of a drop off in the song in the middle & again towards the end where she sings the \\"D*ck in your face\\" line, which is quite hilarious.    3-I Am Your Leader 5/5 - Another fun rap track. The production and the flows on this from Nicki, Ross, and Cam'Ron fit together like a glove. Definitely one to bump in the whip.    4-Beez In The Trap 4/5 - Again, Nicki isn't taking herself too seriously at this point, but seems to be celebration of her success and triumph over several haters who have tried to bring her down. This is a bit of a nursery rhyme ATL style rap, and who better to chime in on it that 2012's omnipresent 2Chainz. This one also bumps in the whip.    5- Hov Lane 0/5 - This track should've been cut from the album. There's absolutely nothing I like about it. The production is terrible, Nicki's lyrics don't save it, the chorus isn't catchy...I always skip this one.    6- Roman Reloaded 3/5 - This track is pretty solid until Wayne comes on and starts rhyming about cocaine and sex. Granted, he's got energy to match Nicki's, but it just seems like a direct about face. Also not fond of the blood gang shout out at the end. Did anybody else catch that? Of course we are talking about Lil Wayne.    7- Champion 4/5 - This track is a pretty solid lyrical outing for all involved. Celebrating success and the struggle it took to get somewhere from nowhere. Drake and Jeezy's verses are weaker than Nicki & Nas's, which is I don't give it 4 stars.    8- Right By My Side - 3/5 Nicki's R&B record with Chris Brown. She holds it down singing-wise on here. But when Chris Brown comes on, it just sounds effortless for him. Then she comes back with a really solid rap verse. I just feel like she should have rapped a first verse also.    9-Sex in The Lounge - 1/5 It only gets one star because it's laughable. Seriously? This would pass on a mixtape but not on a full length lp. Bobby Valentino's name on this track automaticallylet's you it's on some second rate s***.    10- Starships - 5/5 Ah, in comes the dance pop half of the album. This RedOne produced banger is a winner. Her short rap verses allow her to get a crazy and animated as possible, while the vocal parts are in range for her. The house breakdown is pretty insane in the chorus. If you listened the radio at all this year, you've heard this.    11- Pound The Alarm - 4.5/5 Another solid dance number that also did well at the radio this year. It is almost a little too similar to starships, but it's still good. She sings a bit more on this, and her rap bits aren't as stand out.    12- Whip It - 4.5/5 I feel it was a bit much to put three very similar sounding dance records back to back to back. But they're all good, so I don't mind it. Whip it is a bit more comical than both Starships & Pound the Alarm in the rap verses, and the hook reminds me a lot of some of J. Lo's recent pop smashes like \\"On The Floor\\". Lots of fun.    13- Automatic - 2.5/5 Is this really terrible? No. Is it really memorable or special? No. It is very generic though, and should've been cut from the record.    14 - Beaitiful Sinner - 3.5/5 So this one is growing on me. She probably does her most singing on here, as far as range, going in different directions, and not being afraid to go for some runs or hit some notes. She pulls it off and it works, but you have to remember this is the 5th dance track in a row...I'm not chomping at the bit to hear it, but it does work.    15 - Marilyn Monroe - 2/5 This one is a bit boring for me. She's doing a pop ballad a la JoJo or Demi Levato, etc. There was obvious autotune here. It just feels like Britney Spears tried to do a ballad here, and I don't believe. But it sounds ok.    16 - Young Forever - 5/5 Now this works. I could see this doing well at radio. It fits her range, it's danceable, it's believable, anyone can relate to it. She carries it well vocally and it's almost hard to believe it's Nicki (much like when shesang the sick breakdown in Super Bass).    17 - Fire Burns - 0/5 Terrible ass s***. She's off key at points, the song isn't written well at all, the production sounds like a video game soundtrack (the bad kind). Just...no. Sorry, Nicki.    18 - Gun Shot - 3/5 This is ok. A reggae pop track that doesnt make any lyrical sense via all the reggae slang, but it's fun to bop and hum to. Her vocals sound pretty solid here too.    19 - Stupid Hoe - 5/5 as crazy as this song is, it does a good job at closing out the train ride that is Roman Reloaded. This song is hella zany as was the opening track, and is just fun to rap to. Sidebar: if Lil Kim's career isn't dead yet, this put the nails in the coffin.    The deluxe tracks Masquerade and Va Va Voom could've easily made it on here. They are really solid pop/rap tracks in the vein of Super Bass, and Masquerade is even a tad inspirational to boot. David Guetta's Turn Me On is also on the deluxe edition, which I would have welcomed on the standard release versus some of the other crap that was on here. This album is a mixed bag, which is probably why the Grammys passed on it this year. Hopefully she'll take her time with the next release, and play to her strengths instead of just trying anything. Worth checking out for sure, but you'll end up skipping some tracks somewhere. In spite of all my criticism, I still give it 4 stars and would buy a hard copy, since the best tracks are really good.

B007TK77QE|3.0|I was amazed by the Harry Potter series and was looking forward to the adult offering from this writer.  I was a bit disappointed, the characters were less rounded and more stereotypical, the moral messages were less clear and the writing less spell binding.  This was a good read, but not what I had expected.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was great I really like it I wish it was longer but its really great I mean really great.
0316228532|2.0|This book was dull and didn't have even one original thought in it. The characters were repugnant in their small banal cruelties to each other, but that would have been all right if at least the story was propulsive and engaging or if Rowling had given us a reason to root for or sympathize with any of them. Instead, she seemed to ooze contempt for these small-town folk.<br /><br />If Rowling had set out to write a book that was completely opposite from her Harry Potter series, she succeeded. Though I didn't particularly care for the series, at least it had interesting characters, a fascinating world, and a story with high stakes.<br /><br />I titled this review \\"useless\\" because the book was neither entertaining nor enlightening. Read Richard Price if you're interested in the underclass; read John Updike if you're interested in suburbia. The only reason why I didn't give this book one star is because at least Rowling knows how to write a sentence competently.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Its hard for me to give this product a 5 Star rating because it stopped working after 15 months but those 15 months were nice. Only reason why I dont give it a 2 Star rating is because I feel Logitech makes quality products and I may have received one of their lesser ones.
B0084P9202|5.0|For a few years, with Med sud i eyrum vid spilum endalaust, and Jonsi's solo album called Go, Sigur Ros and its singer were heading in a new direction. The music was more openly ebullient, which is to say that it was a bit less meditative and melancholy, and way more fun. (For evidence, see the album cover for Med sud i eyrum, the title of which translates to &#34;With a buzz in our ears we play endlessly,&#34; and about half the tracks on that album and Go.)<br /><br />With Valtari, Sigur Ros has returned to the sometimes soft, sometimes loud, slowly progressing, and always beautiful music of their earlier albums like Takk... and (). While this is a wheelhouse collection of stuff that they do well already, I still really love this album. I like when bands discover new directions and evolve over time, but I can't give this album an &#34;I like it,&#34; because its production is so excellent and the composition so perfectly solid.

B000CNE164|5.0|Much as it was somewhat intimidating when first eyeballing the recorded catalogs of Stevie Wonder and Miles Davis when I was younger,a similar reaction occurred when eyeballing the breadth and scope of Nina Simone's music. At a time when the world of protest music was largely expressed through folk singers such as Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs,Nina Simone was one of the very few people to write and sing about the social concerns of the civil rights movement from an insiders perspective. Her distinctive musical style led the way for many generations of jazz and soul music,from the 70's funk era up to the socially aware end of the hip-hop/neo-soul scene today. Interestingly enough,she did all of this by being something of a creative non conformist. So this is the first Nina Simone album I ever put my hands on. And here's how I see it.<br /><br />  Conceptually this album is quite literal as she explores the blues. This is a genre she might have been mildly embarrassed about. Yet she understood it's true purpose to such a strong degree that \\"Do I Move You\\",her own composition that starts out the album in a manner that she has a full command of the form and authenticity of it's message. On \\"Day And Night\\",her own \\"I Want A Little Sugar In My Bowl\\",\\"Buck\\" and  the ballad \\"Since I Feel For You\\" she is throwing down some heavy soul with the likes of musicians Eric Gale and Bernard Purdie. Her lyrical and vocal expression reflect both personal and physical longing in almost equal measure. On \\"Backlash Blues\\" she's back to the 12 bar end of things. Co-written with Langston Hughes,this song realistically deals with the socio-economic inequities bought on from racism that,sadly we're still very much dealing with in the present day.<br /><br />  While that is a personal favorite of mine here,another is her take of \\"House Of The Rising Sun\\",interpreted with the full gospel power of the sanctified church and not the typically folksy take on the song whatsoever. She ends the album with \\"Blues For Mama\\",her collaboration with Abbey Lincoln dealing with unfaithful and abusive men. Of the bonus tracks,the standout for me is the uptempo soul of \\"Whatever I Am,You Made Me\\". Much as with Miles Davis,the in your face assertiveness of Nina Simone pours out through your brash and sometimes howling vocal instrument and projects an attitude that may not be everyone's cup of tea. However for those who hunger for the soul laid bare,Nina Simone stands out among the Etta James and Aretha Franklin's of her era for her naked expressions of emotion and consciousness. An absolutely revelatory album and highly recommended to those just getting into Nina's music.\\"Blues For Mama\\",her collaboration with Abbey Lincoln dealing with unfaithful and abusive men. Of the bonus tracks,the standout for me is the uptempo soul of \\"Whatever I Am,You Made Me\\". Much as with Miles Davis,the in your face assertiveness of Nina Simone pours out through your brash and sometimes howling vocal instrument and projects an attitude that may not be everyone's cup of tea. However for those who hunger for the soul laid bare,Nina Simone stands out among the Etta James and Aretha Franklin's of her era for her naked expressions of emotion and consciousness. An absolutely revelatory album and highly recommended to those just getting into Nina's music.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I had noticed that our original edition of this film was washed out and faded. I was very pleased to see improvements in the restored edition. Colors are more distinct and vivid and the sound is also improved. Though we've watched it many times, we were surprised to catch a few new subtle nuances in this version that we hadn't seen before.
0920668364|5.0|Bought this for my grown Son. I wanted him to know I will love him always. It brought tears to my eyes! Good for any age!! Wonderful Book!

B000PATZQK|5.0|This album, the swan song of a much-venerated but misunderstood English band, is a masterpiece. The Zombies saw their greatest success as a singles band on this side of the Atlantic. Singles were still the bread-and-butter for virtually all English bands in the '60s. The Who, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, even progressive rock bands like Jethro Tull recorded singles separately from LP material. LPs were too expensive for most teenaged consumers; the 45 and the EP were the order of the day. One of the problems The Zombies faced was that their songs and arrangements were just too sophisticated for for the marketplace. Additionally, visa problems prevented them from capitalizing on their successes in America. After \\"Tell Her No\\" charted in the states nothing more was heard from them over her until 1968 when \\"Odessey and Oracle\\" was released nearly a year after the band had broken up. It was concieved as a final artistic statement. The production wasn't as fully realised as a Rod Argent and Chris White, the band's main songwriters, would've liked: a mellotron was used in place of an orchestra. No problem there, Argent was an adept keyboardist.<br /><br />Recorded at Abbey Road Studios at roughly the same time The Beatles were waxing \\"Sergeant Pepper\\" and Pink Floyd were cutting their debut LP (\\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\") there is not a bad song here, from the opening \\"?Care of Cell 44\\" and \\"A Rose for Emily\\" (the lyrics based on a short story by William Faulkner) to \\"This Will Be Our Year\\" and \\"Time of the Season.\\" The melodies, vocal harmponies and instrumentation employed to craft this fine batch of pop songs will leave you humming them an hour after the first hearing.
0545265355|3.0|i read this trilogy because of the great reviews of the movie and people that have read the first book. book one was good. glad i read the book befor seeing the movie it gave me better knowledge of the characters. book two was ok, it took awhile to get my interest. very slow in the beginning, too much of a romance, about half way thru it picked up an got better. book three was ok as well. after reading the first two , you want to finish the series. i think its a teens, early twenties, type of reading, but i am much older and still enjoyed. not my usual type of reading,  i would reccomend this.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|I downloaded this for my 3 year old and he loves it!<br /><br />If it had any educational vale at all, I would have given it 5 stars. However, it doesn't seem to. Just plain silly fun. That said, it is one of the few games on Android that keeps my toddler busy for more than a few minutes. I often have to make him stop playing it after 20 minutes because I don't want him to have &#34;too much&#34; screen time.<br /><br />Samsung Galaxy S Captivate i897 running JellyBean

B000SGSU58|5.0|Best  Bosch  story  that  I  have  read  thus  far. There  was  beef  to  the  plot. Thought  the  killer  was  one  charactor  then  another  and  finally  twists  into  another.  Harry  given  ultimatum  by  his  girlfriend  finally  starts  to  open  up  and  be  a  little  vulnerable. The  story  held  my  attention  to  the  end.
0316069434|2.0|I loved the earlier books, but this one feels perfunctory or formulaic.<br /><br />a. The side plots are lame.  Gee, Harry's boss is political and cares about PR, while Harry only cares about solving cases.  How original to both Harry and police stories in general. There's not even an effort to develop the boss.<br /><br />b. I think more words are spent describing the food and restaurant where he eats with his girlfriend, than the girlfriend herself.  \\"Have love interest?\\"  Check.<br /><br />c. Am I the only person who is tired of detectives seemingly always liking jazz?  And I like jazz.  Even in a musical genre I don't know, I could with 5 minutes of Google research write something about obscure reggae artists or the like, and some wonderful live performance that you just \\"have to hear.\\"<br /><br />d. No time spent developing his partner, whose only mission is basically doing data entry for Harry.<br /><br />e. Yes, there are farms and grapes in central CA. Thank you Mr. Connelly.  And apparently the IQ of most people there is about 90. (and no, I don't live there.)<br /><br />The development of new characters; Harry being less than perfect; the inside of LA; etc., is gone.  This is one pretty boring procedural that feels like it could be CSI or the Mentalist or something.

B00932AA5G|4.0|The Headhunters tells the story of 5 foot 6 inches tall Roger Brown, who is a headhunter (recruiter for top-level managers). Roger has a beautiful wife, and because of his fear of losing her he showers her with lavish gifts and an expensive home - things that are beyond his means. To support this lifestyle, he steals valuable paintings on the side - from his clients. However, when Roger steals a very expensive painting from an enigmatic client, things take an unexpected - and scary - turn and his life turns upside down.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the Headhunters - I thought the acting was superb and that the script was clever. Sure, there are some hardly believable scenes, but overall it was quite believable. The movie starts slow but picks up pace quickly and then never slows down. There are quite a few twists and turns - some of them easily anticipated, others quite surprising. I especially liked Aksel Hennie in the leading role but the other actors/actresses did a good job as well.<br /><br />There are a few grisly scenes in this movie, so be aware of that. The movie itself is not meant to be a bloodbath or anything, but a few scenes were pretty gruesome. The version I thought was subtitled, and I know some people don't like that. I didn't have any difficulty following the movie though. Overall, I would rate this pretty highly - I think it goes to show that you can make a solid movie without a bunch of big explosions and fires and other bells and whistles that Hollywood relies so much on these days. I think it all ends in the story, and I thought the story here was well-crafted. If you enjoy fast-paced edge of your seat thrillers, I think you'll like this one. If you are looking for a movie with a lot of fight scenes and/or lots of explosions, this isn't your movie.
B005LAIGSC|5.0|Denzel once again carries the story in this high action movie. Great acting by both actors but the great Denzel Washington is without a doubt a Mega Star! Great movie!
B004Q6CG38|5.0|My daughter wanted this book for Christmas.  I'm sure she will love it.  Shipped very quickly and packaged well. Thanks.

B0076DCT2G|4.0|This, once again is John Corey at his finest.  Nelson DeMille has a way of captivating my mind! I am a retired Navy Vet. and during long deployments he alway was with me from port to port.  There have been many sleepless night with these thriller and I thank him as he replaced my family and kept my mind off home.  Have bought all and just can't wait for the next to come out. The many smart-ass remarks just keep coming and I thought I had heard them all....Thanks again! Slojoe.  Nelsons pictures that he paints in your mind are so true and correct, I've visited many, discriptions are very vivid and true...
B005LAIGJQ|4.0|This was a very heart warming movie. Eddie Murphy shows again that he can indeed act . I enjoyed this movie a lot.
B0086700CM|4.0|When I played the first time, I loved it, but after awhile, it got a little boring. But when I'm extermly bored it's a good game to play.<br /><br />A good tip: Try not to play Temple Run in the car unless your not car sick or really good at it.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|The acting was magnificent and the serenity beyond was,  of course, excellent  It is too bad that  this will draw viewers of a certain age...it gives a realistic view of how and what we must deal with over the age sixty.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I greatly  enjoyed the book.  Ms. Kelly is a wonderful writer, she has a way with words that is amazing
0763644765|5.0|I really was disappointed when I read this book.  It seemed simplistic and silly to me.  But I had paid for it, so I read it to my 2-year-old daughter.  She ADORES this book!  She now reads it when she sits on the potty, narrating the pictures herself.  She gets super excited everytime the child in the book has success on the potty.  :-)<br /><br />Just goes to show you, who knows what a toddler will love!  But this was a hit for my little one.

1400067820|5.0|I had a lot of wonderful \\"Aha\\" moments listening to this audio book about Antifragile vs. Fragile systems.  The author has identified a key underlying paradyne for failure or success, whether personal, in business or with government programs.<br /><br />Long ago, another book: Leadership and the new science by Margaret Wheatley convinced me that nature is self organizing and business can be set up to be self organizing.  Nassim Nicholas Taleb echo's that idea and states, the natural order is overwhelmingly Antifragile, while our manmade order tends to be Fragile.  The earth and mankind have evolved all by themselves without some great leader calling the shots, because nature is Antifragile.  If we listen/obey leaders who tell us how to live our own lives (which we already know intuitively and logically), we are likely to become Fragile.<br /><br />Fragility is all about risks.  An activity is Fragile, if the downside (negative) risks predominate over the upside risks or the downside risks are greater than the upsize risks.  Fragile is the property of most manmade systems.  How does that apply to us?  Modernity has created structures that allows certain groups of people, like corporate bankers, politicians and academics to take excessive risks without any skin in the game and thereby pass the downside consequences onto others, making them Fragile.  One way avoid this Nassim Nicholas Taleb argues, is to make ourselves Antifragile by insisting all decisions makers affecting our lives have skin in the game.  However, bankers, politicians and academics usually have no skin in the game.  In fact, often they gain at the expense of the people they serve.  So the solution is, limit the size and power of banks, corporations and government to minimize the damage.<br /><br />Taleb also points out that top down decisions by leaders who don't understand complex system, such as our economy, and have no skin in the game pass laws/regulations that make small problems large; for example our Financial Crisis:<br />1. The Federal Reserve made our financial system Fragile when it tried to prevent a small adjustment/recession by keeping interest rates too low and ended up causing a housing bubble plus the great recession.<br />2. Taxpayers became Fragile when large banks took excessive downside risk because the government protected the banks against that risk at taxpayer expense.<br /><br />There is a bit of fluff in the book, but overall Taleb makes a great case limiting downsize risk and how we can achieve it.  He deserves Nobel Prize.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I went into this movie not quite sure what I was getting (not having read the book), and came out not quite sure what I had gotten. That's not a criticism - a sense of wonder and something beyond appears all too seldom in mainstream movies.<br /><br />Really, this can only be understood in its final moments. Moving forward, we see a young man desperate for something to believe in, taking a cafetria approach to Hinduism, Catholicism, and Islam, trying to feed his hungry soul from the smorgasbord. Then, the catastrophe at sea lands him in a life boat with a small managerie. Oddly, the different beasts appear at different times, despite the boat's small size and dubious hiding places. The largest part of the movie describes his uneasy standoff with Richard Parker, the only other survivor, as supplies run out and conditions worsen. Finally Pi (the protagonist) finds land, and is saved - and Richard Parker disappears. As the only survivor, he's the center of interest for insurance investigators trying to understand the wreck.<br /><br />Under their merciless interrogation, Pi's story suddenly changes - and changes everything that had gone before. His deep and wide sense of belief falls into place, the whole time at sea takes new meaning, Richard Parker becomes both less and more than he'd been all along, and even his childhood feat of memorizing mathematical pi (3.14 etc) to hundreds of places earns a new understanding.<br /><br />And, when everything in the story changes, perhaps the viewer changes too - I know I did.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B0073COMUW|3.0|We ordered 7 bulbs (order of 4 and then order of 3).<br /><br />3/4 were bad in first shipment and Amazon refunded the money so while I was a little disappointed it was smooth.<br /><br />The one that worked was actually pretty decent and I am hoping it will last longer than the CFLs we have been using which have been going bad like crazy.  Great daylight brightness and instant on.<br /><br />In the 2nd order, 1 was defective but 2 worked.  So if you are ok with trial and error until you receive a good bulb, go for it.<br />Dont rely on them though if its urgent.<br /><br />Dhwani
0307341550|4.0|I enjoyed this book, I finished it in a few days. Not because it was an amazing story, but because I was truly insterested in the \\"who done it\\" aspect. Gillian is an amazing writer, she tells a good story and isnt afraid to Go There and be edgy with out being Fifty Shades. I like the fact her characters are crude and hard and have a story that screwed them up in obvious reasons. I didnt enjoy Amma. She is seriously a mothers worst nightmare. Her at 13 was such a discusting teenager,I have 3 daughters and will never ever forget this character. I was not perfect as a 13yr old but the way she acted was just discusting.And if she was such a whore, living in a town where everyone gossiped, how didnt her parent know she was a whore? I mean really, she wore pigtails at home and stripper shoes at school? I liked Camille (I think was her name) but I didnt understand her Cutting triggers. OK, so she is covered in scars...except for her back on her shoulder blades I think. How the heck did you reach your lower back? Try it...its not easy. Also she would think of a word to cut, that had nothing to do with anything that was going on. Like I am mad at my mom so I want to cut \\"Cattle\\" into my stomache (just an example)....ummm alright. Also when the story was over it was like..o.v.e.r......just like that. Like you were waiting and waiting and then its summed up and done. period. bu-bye
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Would highly recommend to a friend....a sweet love story with a bit of punch. :) an easy read with an unexpected story line.
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|Far from Pixar's best. As magnificent as the animation is, the story is trite and not terribly engaging. Can't hold a candle to The Incredibiles or Wall-E.

0307387178|3.0|Krakauer did a decent job of writing this, and I am of mixed feelings about McCandless, some admiration but much to criticize.<br /><br />I don't understand why there is but one small photo, a self-portrait of McCandless.  Krakauer mentions cameras and films, he went back to Alaska with Chris's parents, so he was on good terms with them.  Whatever the reason, the lack of photos is a serious drawback.<br />I just saw an hour long special on McCandless that included a large number of stills, of Chris as a boy, grown with his parents, and many shots from Alaska.  The program didn't explore the subject very deeply - it was tv, after all.  But the photos added so much, even just the impression of how small he was, how innocent-looking and vulnerable.<br /><br />There is no explanation for the lack of photos and it is a serious drawback to the book.
B0045NDVFE|5.0|This music is fantastic. The word play in the lyrics is great [you lie...like a penny in a parking lot], and the vocals are skillfully done.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Wuthering Height is a beautifully written novel.  It does stand as a timeless classic to be read at any price.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|...And I know what I'm doing in April when Rod goes on tour! I do love this album, but I can't help but think about the palpable energy he brings to every live performance which occasionally fails to shine through in his albums.<br /><br />Many of the collaborations shine--Cee Lo's soulful bombast on the title track contrasts well with Rod's more vulnerable vocal interpretation--but a few tracks leave me wishing that Rod had the song all to himself. Michael Bublè doesn't match Rod's enthusiasm, and provides a skippable track in what is otherwise a very solid piece of holiday listening. Rod's ability to evoke greatness out of these songs we've heard so many times before speaks to his talent as an artist and the timelessness of his unique brand of smoky coolness.<br /><br />The album resonates with Rod's signature passion and style- but there can be no doubt that in the `studio act/live act' debate, he is firmly in the latter camp. `Merry Christmas, Baby' would make a great holiday present, but for a gift that truly captures the Rod Stewart experience, I'm putting concert tickets on my Christmas list.

B00A6N7BS0|3.0|This is worth the watch, but not exactly what I expected.  From the previews I thought the 2 guys stormed the cartels compound, but that is not the case.  I guess I was just expecting something a little different.  I was still entertained so it is worth renting.
B009G78EE2|5.0|great music, great lyrics.  Never heard of this album before, but I will look further into it when I get the time.
B005HS4CUY|5.0|Our kids are 15 & 18, and they still love the Toy Story!  As do my husband and I.  The 3d version were even better than the originals in my opinion.
B0096PAA6E|1.0|So much for the next Jimi Hendrix. There are glimpses of the next guitar god, but it is hidden in a quagmire of pop experiments gone awry. The solid songs on this album are a painful reminder of what could have been.

B000QCQ9O8|4.0|I gave this book four stars because the story was well written and moving. It did not receive five stars because this is not a book that I would read again and again to reunite with the characters as they go through their conflicts. I would recommend this book for individuals who enjoy dramatic period pieces.
B007HACDLK|5.0|A fantastic story, continuing the series with style.  All of the characters you've come to  love and hate together in a new book.  Vince Flynn is better than ever.
B0055SJVPW|5.0|I love this movie and could watch it over and over.  It's funny and romantic.  The disc was a good buy too.
B007O3QC8K|2.0|First I would like to declare myself as a big Sir Simon Rattle fan. After obtaining almost all of his CD and DVD releases (as well as some broadcast recordings), I greatly admire Simon's music sensitivity, conducting capabilities and courage of innovation. What he is currently doing with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra is astonishing, revolutionary, and almost always fascinating, which I can't think of any peer of his in this world could have done better.<br /><br />With that being said, I have to say with pity that to me, Sir Simon Rattle still isn't among the best Bruckner conductors. His recording of the 4th and the 7th are overall great performances, but the dazzling details of the strings are often too much of an distraction from what I think is the main characteristics of Bruckner's music: the solid chorale-like melodic curve (often brought out by brass and woodwind instruments) resembling the internals of a grand cathedral, and the deepest sincerity of soul expressed in long breathes and firm pace. It seems to me that Sir Simon Rattle (and his colleagues who worked on the reconstruction of the fourth movement) prefer more vivid, lively, 'happening' music, while Bruckner tended to build his music in a more static, monumental fashion, isolated from the secular world, and, quoting his own words, \\"gazing too deep into a maiden's eyes\\".<br /><br />As a result, I find this fundamental difference in tastes becomes a serious problem of this performance as well as the reconstruction of the fourth movement. Yes the orchestra played the fourth movement with full passion and dedication, yes the fourth movement has a lot of dazzling moments, yes the re-constructors are strictly following the guidance that Bruckner has already laid out when they were 'filling the blanks', but the music itself isn't at all sincere, touching or inspiring, and lacks the unparalleled qualities I often find in Bruckner's later finales (4, 5, 6, 7, 8).<br /><br />I seriously doubt this \\"conclusive revised edition\\" (according to the CD booklet) would be of any satisfaction for Bruckner himself or a true Bruckner music lover. Therefore I only give it two stars (without the reconstruction I would've given it a four). I enjoy the symphony much more deeply when it ends with the soothing horn and the triple pizzicato in E major of the grand Adagio.
B007VYQ9G2|5.0|So,do you believe that chimps are just a thread away from human DNA's?  If so, this film is for you!  You'll be able to validate that humans lean to war with one another as much as we love and care for one another.  More disturbing, we use our intelligence to kill and eat meat.  Extra research indicates that the breed of monkeys preyed upon by chimps are in danger of extinction.  Genocide!  This innocent Disney romp through nature becomes a horror film.  A must see!
B0041KVXLK|5.0|I have wanted the vinyl version of this record for quite a while now.  I certainly was not disappointed.  It was worth the wait.  The sound was so good.  I am very happy.
0375507256|4.0|David Mitchell is really a great writer - I admire writers who have such skill. I do have some quips about the stories and why, rather than spoiling the book for others, I'll keep my opinion to myself.<br /><br />Enjoy! (I still have yet to see the movie.)

B007TXN4TK|4.0|Love this app! You learn to play basic tunes but in order to advance you will have to pay.I recommend this app to anyone who loves to learn for fun.
B00AE6SS5O|5.0|This is a good mystery game if you like mystery,s and it is really fun to play  and it is also for Christmas
B008D28HYS|5.0|I love these puzzles I am so addicted to them. I just wish new puzzles were added more frequently. I end up spending hours solving the puzzles. Once I start I cant put it down till I have solved the new ones added.
B000M53GM2|3.0|I like the Bond series, and I realize that they have a large fantasy element, frequently lack coherent plots, etc.  3 stars may be a bit generous here.  I give it decent marks for the stunts and for the Bond girls, but that's about it.  Even the stunts are partly wasted by poor writing, poor acting, poor direction.  For example there's a plane involved in the opening sequence, leading to a spectacular stunt, but the audience isn't really allowed to see the danger involved, or to see Bond's thought process as he decides what to do.  Instead, Bond just does the stunt, as if it's a gymnastics trick he's practiced and perfected hundreds of times.  A better use of the stunt would have been for Bond to show that he's trapped and going to die anyway if he doesn't try the stunt, also to show him hesitate before he puts it all together in his mind, etc.  And the entire movie is like this, Bond just doing, not really thinking (at least that we can see developing), not really showing concern that he might not succeed.  The dialog is mostly weak, and the one-liners seem strained, and delivered at inappropriate times, i.e. while the danger is still underway, rather than after.  The movie frequently reminds me of those old swashbuckler films, where the hero takes on three at a time in a swordfight, yet still has time to chat up the girl as he fends them off - as if he's just toying with them, or they are a minor annoyance rather than a real danger.<br /><br />I realize the Bond series already strains credibility, but this is really too much - another example of this, Bond uses an automatic weapon to mow down a great number of troops; those same troops have the same automatic weapon and shoot back, yet they all miss him while Bond mows them down.  Why?  Because he's Bond!  Bond also wins at cards, we are not really able to understand the game, but Bond wins because he apparently has the better cards.  So Bond is great at cards because he draws better hands?  That's silly.  And notto give too much away, but Bond isn't the only one who has a ridiculous ability to survive.  Frankly a weak acting start for Brosnan in the role, he says the lines (\\"Bond, James Bond\\", \\"Shaken not stirred\\") as if checking off the proper boxes, but without much conviction.  One other thing about dialog; as others have noted, it's strange to have Russians speaking to each other in English, rather than speaking Russian with English subtitles.  So this was highly flawed, even in a series that rarely delivers the \\"perfect\\" (albeit entertaining overall) film. Fortunately the Brosnan Bond movies got much better after this one.  But then again, this one has stunts and Bond women worth seeing, so... 3 stars (barely). At the current Amazon price of $5 for the DVD though, it will give you some entertainment if you can look past serious flaws.
B006R1T40I|5.0|I have been a fan for a long time.  This is a great new album for old and new fans alike.<br />Great music and Bonnie at her Best.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|Victorian novels just don't often lend themselves well to good film adaptations simply because they're so long; the pleasures of detail they afford are best translated for BBC miniseries rather than for two-hour screenings in a movie theater. That being said, it's been singular that until this there hadn't really been a satisfying adaptation of JANE EYRE since the Robert Stevenson version from the 1940s with Joan Fontaine (who was, admittedly, too pretty and too docile to be a believable Jane Eyre) and Orson Welles. But this one, directed by Cary Juji Fukunaga is pretty good. The moors are shot gorgeously, to make them look like nothing else on earth; the score by Dario Marinelli, is just about perfect (atmospheric and romantic without being intrusive); and the two leads, Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender, are quite fine--both are attractive, yet neither is so classically pretty that it seems unlikely they would describe one another as plain. Granted, the story is too rushed; but how else are you going to shoehorn in 500 pages worth of plot into a two-hour movie? (Remarkably, they even manage to get the St. John Rivers story into here, which the Stevenson version eschewed.) Its only other failing is that it's probably not scary enough: you don't get the great architectural sense of Gothic space and the looking \\"third story\\" that you do, say, in the Stevenson version. (Here, Bertha only seems kept away in a hidden linen closet.)
B008KMHFJY|5.0|Loved this story of Travis & Abbey. Finally a love story with real meaning and real emotions to situations but finding a way together in the end. Can't wait for Walking Disaster!
B0036OS3Q0|5.0|These boots are great. Light and very warm. I work in temperatures around 10 degrees in the winter and these keep my feet toasty with just a pair of light socks. The rubber makes them easy to wash out and keeps the water out. They fit ok but I have really small feet so shoes that fit are hard to find in general. All over A!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I liked this book usually only like dog books, how ever, I did not like the ending because I have to get the other book without knowing the ending
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|really good especially since its free a do not ever get a oreo colored  just sayin just sayin no way man
B004I744AS|5.0|wonderful app. a wealth of information at your fingertips. also love the dictionary games. love the website also. try it.
B005KDDUVS|4.0|It is also a good novel. This book was recomended to me by a friend. I also recomend it to my friends.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|A friend of mine turned me onto this album....I can't thank him enough.  I was drawn in on the first listen and since then, each time I listen to it, it keeps getting better.  Some truly talented young musicians.
B007HACDLK|3.0|i have enjoyed previous in this  action series. unfortunately this one has gone quite a bit downhill. it is more melodrama than drama. the sub plot lines are really really thin and almost seem made up as he went along. it wasnt horrendous but i cant say i would recommend it. it reads like it was done in a hurry to meet publishers expectations. sooner or later hopefully publishers will realize that the key to success is meeting readers expectations.
B0096CDG0O|1.0|The facebook login just goes around in circles from the login screen to the facebook login info -- it never logs in. So I tried to create a login by email and it told me no connection, at the same moment it pulled my email, so I know I was connected. A second try told me my email was already in use. Backed out again to log in and it told me no connection. Again.<br /><br />I can't play the game if there is absolutely no way to log into it.
B0015AARJI|1.0|I received a fake controller the buttons are so stiff and i have to push the buttons all the way in so it can react and i open up the controller the it look so different from my original controller that came with my ps3 very disappointed i recommend not to buy.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|Donald Fagen has hit form again this year:  if you liked the classic Steely Dan stuff (I'm thinking Pretzel Logic or Aja) or his first great solo album The Nightfly, this gets pretty close.  Music is uptempo Steely Dan style, lyrics are obtuse as always and the mood is late night listening.  Recommended.
B000050GQM|3.0|Without reading the book first this would be impossible to follow. Good job by Sutherland. Differs slightly from the book.
B008V0OLOW|4.0|I've read some of the poor reviews, but these folks just don't understand the concept of this album and expected it to be like other Diana Krall recordings. This is a departure for Ms Krall into a beautifully stylized world of the 20s and 30s. T-Bone Burnett's production is musically high calibre, but audio quality of Diana's voice is a step down from previous outings. The outstanding features are song selection, lyrics, concept, and interpretation. This could be a classic, especially the deluxe version which has some wonderful takes of solo vocal and piano.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|Typical Follett. Moves quickly and nice character development. Lots of twists and great development of the scene and time. Easy read.
B005HS4CUY|3.0|The movies are excellent.  That said, I thought I was buying the set that had both the 3D and the Blu Ray versions of the movie.  You really can't tell from the picture or the description.  This is the 3D version ONLY.  I have a 3D Blu Ray player and TV, so  I can watch them in 3D, but I thought I was buying both versions, so that we could watch them in regular, non-3D on our other TV, as well.  Can't complain too much, though Amazon should update their product description to clearly state what you're buying.
0739352989|5.0|I haven't completed all three books yet, but the voice and quality are very good. It's interesting how the title fits with the book. It's definitely entertaining.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne knows how to keep her audience interested. I love this book.  I would recommend this book to anyone that likes interesting books.
098555780X|5.0|This has several great ideas for para cord ties. Unusual. Much more interesting than granny knots. I will try some today!
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|this app would be fantastic if they let you save the different games that you have created. On the Kindle Fire,  the app always says that it is not responding,  but if you click on the 'Wait' button, it works fine. you only have like 20 minutes before the app says your trial period is up. but then you go back to the start page and this app starts a new game for you. I would say this app is good if you want ti try out minecraft before you buy the seven dollar one.

B000UZNRS2|5.0|I'm working my way through the Camel Club series based on my wife's recommendation.<br /><br />This book picked up right where the last one left off, which was great because I wanted to know what was going to happen to Annabelle.<br /><br />It truly lived up to my expectations and felt very well rewarded by the end of the book.<br /><br />Now, it's on to Divine Justice.<br /><br />-WG

B008CLI3TE|5.0|Great series....worth watching.  Women and men will both love this series. Is pretty sexually explicit so keep that in mind
B009B0L324|3.0|I've been a huge fan for almost 32 years but the same old songs played over and over live is boring.  Love the band but I found myself doing alot of fast forwarding just to get to Hells Bells, Shoot to Thrill and For Those About to Rock.  Live CDs are for the most part, a waste of time and money but I'm a huge fan so I'll just about buy anything they release.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|First understand this is one of the single largest Lego sets ever...like actually. I think it ranks 4th or 5th in terms of pieces. The instruction booklet that comes with it measures about 13 X 18 and is about as thick as a lengthy graphic novel.<br /><br />It comes with 24 minifigures and several versions of your favorites, which allows you to reenact the most iconic scenes in any one of the numerous backdrops on board the Death Star. And there are many.<br /><br />The entire set has more features than I can name readily including but not limited to two working elevators, functional doors, and rotating turrets. Plus believe me, many, many more!<br /><br />And there are tons of little surprises like hidden storage for weapons. It seems I discover something new each time and I built<br />it.<br /><br />They even manage to maintain some minor level of screen accuracy (to reason of course). Many recall the scene from Star Wars (Ep. IV 1977) where Luke, Chewy and Han spring Leia from her prison cell aboard the Death Star then flee into the garbage chute, only to face the Dianoga and imminently collapsing walls of the compactor. You can recreate this scene exactly. And I recently discovered you can even throw the minifigures into the garbage chute and they will land in the garbage compactor. There is also a lever that then allows you to collapse the walls. There are even little bits of garbage and the dreaded Dianoga included.<br /><br />It is expensive but worth every penny whether you are a LEGO fan or Star Wars devotee. Be prepared to set aside a few days maybe two if you are good.
B0096CDG0O|4.0|I was getting really sick of the free version. The ads weren't so bad, it was the bugginess. It froze often, button presses lagged like crazy, it used a lot of computing power, and once even rolled for me. But the paid version is much faster and no bugs so far. Totally worth it.
B006X5L6VS|4.0|As a professional astronomer I found this program very easy to use and I can use it right next to my telescope at night.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This is a good, basic game with no frills. The graphics are nice, not glaring. It is a free game so as far as I am concerned there is absolutely nothing to complain about.
B005LJETYI|3.0|The themes and concepts that are explored in the book are interesting and pretty well thought through, especially the time paradox. However, the book left me unsatisfied. The aliens are very ALIEN indeed, and are pretty scary, which is good. On the other hand, the protagonists are endowed with some pretty unbelievable abilities, which seemed a bit far fetched. That said, they are also pretty human and flawed, which is a nice touch.<br /><br />The humor was rather sparse, and I couldn't shake a feeling that the main character is speaking with a boring monotone (although nothing is worse in this regard than Ha Jin's &#34;War Trash&#34;). However, that could also be due to the fact that the book is written by a Japanese author, about a Japanese soldier, and I am just not used to the Japanese conversation style.<br /><br />To sum it up, the aliens and the time paradox concepts interested me, but the narrative and the plot didn't generate a whole lot of excitement
B007SGM084|4.0|I liked the books, there was just a small part that became boring.<br /><br />Here are my seven words that I have to write
0792163710|5.0|I chose this rating because I have loved this movie from the first time I saw it, when it was new!  I recommend it to anyone who loves old western movies.  Alan Ladd was terrific- and you can't go wrong!  Did somebody say &#34;corny&#34;??  So what, I don't care!  Corny is alright by me, ther is nothing wrong with being corny about loving old western movies!  Film-makers today could take some notes on this!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys history. I picked this book because I saw her interview on tv about it before the movie premier and wanted to read about Lincoln before I saw the  movie. Her book is spectacular at truly capturing the reality. I really enjoyed the book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I honestly did not believe that I would like this book geared towards teens/young adults.  However I could not put it down and read it in less than a day.  I would suggest getting all three if available, I did not and was frantically searching for the next two at midnight.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It is an enjoyable game. The levels are not always easy which is nice  and there is a variety of sizes and number of flows.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like it a lot. Still getting used to using my Kindle.  Looking forward to playing this till I become an expert.
B004JN1CW4|3.0|I hope you didn't read this novel to gain understanding about why the characters were in the maze, because this is never explained.  It provides an ending, but no explanation.<br /><br />How and why does the measuring of variables and patterns create a vaccine?  We are never told.  No plausible explanation is even attempted.  The most likely reason for this is because the author never had a plausible explanation to provide for us, so he never offers an explanation.  So in the end we only get because I said so, that is why.<br /><br />Let's talk about the disease and plausibility.  The author explains a systemic type of disease.  He explains that there are sores.  If this was only a disease of the brain, there would not be sores.  Yet, he explains that the cure and disease is only brain related.  We are told that they have a brain implant that records the patterns.  Would this be like a CAT scan?  If a certain part if the brain was believed to be causing the destruction of the brain...wouldn't it be smarter to block that portion of the brain with an implant?  And were any neurochemicals implicated?  If it is the brain, why would you make a vaccine?<br /><br />Next, is it really smart to kill off the smartest of the immune in experimentation?  Wouldn't it be smarter to kill off the village idiots?  Nothing in here lead me to believe that intellect was a factor in being immune.  Of course, we never knew why they were immune.<br /><br />We are told that the government purposely released the Flare to reduce population.  Please turn to page 125 in The Author's Handbook and consult the section on evil government conspiracies.  To be plausible the government should have a vaccine to protect themselves before releasing an evil biological weapon of mass destruction.  This author doesn't appear to feel the need to give us plausible reasons.<br /><br />Overall, the Maze was intriguing, but the author failed to follow through on his story.  Sadly, nothing in the original story was ever explained.  We never even learn why Teresa, Aris, and Thomas were helping design the experiments.  While we get an ending, the author chose to explain none of the original storylines that caused me to buy his work.  This was just a bunch of klunk.
B00A72989U|3.0|Well - for the exception of being able to download my album per Mp3 to my computer immediately, this CD is not as good as any of Alicia's prior albums. She used to be one of my favorite singers!!!!  I feel that she rushed into this or she just made up something in the sound room.  It will take getting used to, and I will try to listen to it again - but for the exception of &#34;Girl on Fire&#34; which is even a different version that I do not care about - it is okay.

0525478817|5.0|Okay, so now that I finished this book, I've read some negative reviews that kind of irk me. People say that these teenagers are unrealistic and hard to believe. I am a 16 year old girl, and this is completely true. I have never (and probably will never) met/meet teenagers like Hazel, Augustus and/or Issac... Their wit and overall amazing-ness astound me. Like seriously, an attractive star basketball player who loves to read & has great humour?! But that's why I love this book. I mean, if I wanted some real teenage dialogue, why would I be reading?? I like that I can be taken away on a journey via reading--away from reality, you know? The only downfall is that it makes reality depressing, I guess. And I like learning SAT vocab words through books... How else am I going to remember them? With that said, I am still a 16-year-old girl, so I feel like some of these concepts are above me. I need to re-read this, especially when I get older (I have not experienced a person close to me dying before... I am glad about this fact though).<br />DFTBA!
B005LAIHZY|4.0|Movies that appeal to all age groups are always a welcome addition to our library.<br />Brave has enough depth to keep the adults awake and enough innocence that my children (age 5 - 14) can watch

0891419063|5.0|I wish every service man and woman would read this book and see what another generation did for this country. I know it is hard on you now, but you have never had to see or do the things these men have had to live with. I know you are fighting an enemy you don't understand and I hate it, especially sense it is never going to do any good, these people don't want peace, they just want to kill.

B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn continues to wow his readers with new, page-turning thrillers.  He keeps his main character, Mitch Rapp, ever evolving in his career and personal life.  Yes, I think Mitch is a real person.  This story is believable, current and keeps you up at night.  So very happy also to learn that Mr. Flynn is feeling so much better.  God bless you and please keep writing.  I don't think I can wait a year for a new Mitch Rapp thriller.

B00936A0RU|2.0|Nick Cave the song writer wrote the script of this film based on a book written by a descendant of the 3 \\"lawless\\" moonshiner brothers in West Virginia during the '20s.  The film centers on the middle brother played by Tom Hardy and the younger sibling<br />played by Shia LaBeouf.  Other cast of characters includes a flashy government agent played by Guy Pearce and a notorious gangster played by Gary Oldman who mysteriously disappeared halfway through the film.  There are also 2 strings of love interests from a woman with a shady past from Chicago and a local preacher's daughter.  Both didn't add much to the story.<br />Tom Hardy lowered his head and brood.  Only Shia LaBeouf made the attempt to inject some life into this listless film.<br />The problems with this film are the weak storyline and shallow characterization which undermine the drama and the effectiveness of the intermittent actions and violence.  The mayhem also way stretches viewer's believability.  A man had his throat cut and laid in a pool of blood but survived after walking 20 miles to the hospital. The same person later got hit multi-bullets including a blow hole in the back of this jacket the size of small cannon ball.  Another was shot in the liver and they all survived.  Even the music is haphazard and ineffective.  A multi-million dollar film with a large fine young cast were wasted by the poorly written script.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Along the line of the Lion and Lion's Game. An author who knnow's what he's talking about, and  good story teller. Can excuse a few unreakistic situations,
B004LWZWGA|1.0|In the old days in Hollywood, there was the role of the producers who provided check and balance to the works of the screen writers and the directors.  The result was the golden era of Hollywood.  Nowadays writers/directors once achieved certain fame and success, they were given carte blanche to make whatever the movies they wished to make.  The result is this last instalment of the most recent Batman trilogy which cost hundreds of millions to make and with the best available cinematic technology and the top actors from Hollywood.  The result is a close to 3 hours of boredom, confusion and a story goes nowhere co-written by Chris Nolan and his brother.  This film makes Michael Bay a movie god of blockbusters.  It is a maddening waste of money, resources, acting talent and viewers' time.
B005M5OSBK|5.0|The collection of music is given to be spectacular, I wouldn't have bought it if it hadn't had great reviews. This comment is more towards shipping and handling; it arrived earlier than scheduled (which is always pleasant), well packaged and with no damage to the product. I would highly recommend buying this album from amazon.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|this movie is amazing! You deffinitly cant beat the price. You should also buy the Firefly series to go along with this!!
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|I usually buy this type of animation, but I'll pass on this 1. The story line was just ok. The graphics are good though.
B00338QENI|5.0|What a way to be remembered.  I couldn't put this book down because the topic of DNA is so current and I did not know this story and my emotions ran the gamut from intensely sad (for the plight of the Lacks family) to very happy to know this research is being done.  I do think the family should have been compensated for the commercial aspect of selling Henrietta's cells.

B007JZGIMS|1.0|I have the big Kindle Fire, and it's pretty good. However, two really awful things about the music player provided: no equalizer, and for some reason, if I have one album with twelve songs, the provided player sets it up as twelve albums with one song. Sooooo. I went on the app store to find a music player with an equalizer.<br /><br />I found the free version of this product. It's buggy. But it saw and set up my albums correctly! I had the actual 12 songs on one album. Great. So I tried the equalizer bit. It brought up a message I had to upgrade to the Premium version. Then unexpectedly, it let me change the equalizer columns. Fantastic! It sounded great! Then, when I tried to change it again, I was directed to buy the Premium version. So I did.<br /><br />It didn't show up. No confirming email either. So I go back to the Amazon app store. It confirms I bought the app. It confirms it's compatible with my device. But when I try to download it, it says you already downloaded it. I check. No premium app. I go back to the app store, try downloading it again, it says no, you got it already. I start the app, it's still saying I need to get the premium version. I search the Kindle Fire. There is no premium app on my device. I go to the Amazon app store, try to download it again, it says no, you got this already. I check emails; still no confirmation. Go to app store, try to leave review.<br /><br />What it tells me, YOU CAN'T COMMENT because you HAVE NOT downloaded it! Really! Really?<br /><br />What can I do? I bought the app, but Amazon thinks BOTH that I bought it and downloaded it AND I did not buy it and can't comment. The fact is I bought the premium version and can't download it, and Amazon is acting crazy about it!<br /><br />i really like the free version. But every instruction in it refers to how it integrates well with Itunes, and absolutely nothing in it indicates it 'knows' it's on a Kindle Fire, despite the fact it is working on a Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Are you reading this, Amazon and you, the app developer? This is such a stupid way to go wrong!you reading this, Amazon and you, the app developer? This is such a stupid way to go wrong!

B003DZX44I|5.0|This was a Christmas Gift for my Granddaughter last year and she was really happy that she got it because she had wanted it for quite awhile,she has gotten a lot of enjoyment out of it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What can I say other than this series just gets better and better. The core actors seem to out do themselvess in each new episode.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|I have a Cinemascope screen to correctly show the movie without black bars, the on and off insertion of IMAX squarish shots ruins the presentation because I have to constantly put the projector out of its Cinemascope setting for each shot otherwise the taller IMAX images spill over the top and bottom of the screen.<br /><br />To avoid that I was forced to see the whole movie with black bars just because of the continuos IMAX tall shots inserted throughout the entire movie. I know that most people have HDTV sets that are 16x9 and will see the black bars anyway and the IMAX shots would use the whole screen, but not for Cinemascope home theaters projecting a movie that supose to be Cinemascope.<br /><br />When I saw the movie at the local theater I do not remember if the IMAX shots forced the aspect ratio of the projection to be adjusted, I believe the image used the whole width of the screen all the time. Perhaps the IMAX theaters showed it the way the Bluray is, but there should be two versions of discs then.<br /><br />Consideration should be given also to newer HDTV sets that are Cinemascope 2.35:1 aspect ratio that show widescreen movies without black bars, these TVs were specifically designed to do so and they would show most of this movie correctly, but would cut the top/bottom of all the IMAX shots.<br /><br />The Bluray should either have a menu to choose for either aspect ratio to display constantly, rather than switching between formats on its own, or two discs should have been offered for the consumer to choose depending on the display device they have.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|I don't always agree with this Author but I always found him thought provoking and interesting.  He recently passed away from esophageal cancer.  He wrote this book knowing his death was imminent. The voice of this wonderful author has been silenced, it's a great loss to the Literary world.
B008XG1X18|3.0|i have found that this app is even easier to use than the normal website pinterest, but the problem is that once or twice a week this app will freeze and i will have to reboot it and start over. other than that its great

0525953728|5.0|Thank GOD for Americans like these men.  I only wish every American would view them in the same light and support their every action.
B009XY97VC|4.0|I tend to like soundtrack-related music, and TSFH really does a great job w/ them.  I can sit down and listen to this at any time.  If you don't prefer movie soundtracks or music without words, this isn't for you.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I love this cd. It has some wonderful classics and highlights some great talents that don't try to overpower or out perform.
B008518MOW|4.0|It was better than expected. #3 is usually bad, but this one was entertaining. I love Will Smith, and this movie was of typical ones for him.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|does anything else need to be said? this is for sure the best xmas movie and best of the lampoons vacations... 10 bucks for the blu ray new? done
B009XY97VC|5.0|This album really shows off the talent of this group. The variety of rhythms and tones selected are outstanding. I Really liked the larger amount of vocals as well. Sure songs without lyrics are very nice to listen to, but having the talent to make these songs feel as they always did while using lyrics is really cool. The &#34;Epic&#34; style music really makes these guys who they are in the movie audio industry, and also game trailers, movie trailers, etc.
B009E9QOEO|5.0|I bought this by request from my 18 year old grandson. This was a favorite group of his father who has passed away, so, it was important to him to get this set.  It is almost all he plays, because he loves the group, and because it is a link to better days. It amazes me how Led has transcended generations and is still going strong. Thanks for this.
B008W14ZD2|5.0|I have listened to Owl City since the first album hit the market. I have watched his music evolve as each album progressed. The first album had amazing lyrics(creative but sometimes had to use your imagination to see some sense). The second album had more of a feeling of calmness and definitely set the bar for great vocals. This album though, changed the whole game. Like the second album, Adam Young pushed his voice louder and made it sound less of a shy voice. This album also had more of a &#34;Dance&#34; feel to it, as if it was better written for concert appearances. Great change to the more monotonous first two albums.
0142421375|4.0|Theodore Boone is a middle school boy, growing up in a small town with his lawyer parents. When his best friend, April, goes missing, the whole town is worried. Being April's best friend, he makes it his mission to find her. Using skills he has learned from watching his parents, and some of his own knowledge, he creates a plan to track April down.<br />This is a thoroughly interesting and well-written novel I would definitely recommend! If you are a lover of mysteries, this is a real treat.
B0086700CM|5.0|good way to relax and unwind after a stress filled day at the office. it is a great beginner game for those of us who never played Mario.

B0037AGASG|5.0|This album is awesome I love Justin Bieber and all his songs. This is worth the money. Great present for any girl.
B007V65R54|5.0|This is a book by a largely self-taught prognosticator of everything from economics to political polling, to baseball scores and poker hands.<br /><br />Nate Silver has become famous for his correct predictions of the results of 2012 presidential elections in all states and the Senate races in all but one.  But his mathematical knowledge, insight and expertise go far beyond elections, and he's a superb writer.<br /><br />If you already know Bayesian probability theory, can apply it, and understand why both polls and GDP forecasts often miss the mark, you might not learn much.  But if, like me, you studied that theory years ago in a specialized field (thermodynamic and statistical physics, in my case) and don't remember it too well, you'll love this book.<br /><br />Silver's sprightly writing and superb focus make him a great teacher.  Like the best college professors, he makes what could be a dry exposition of math and statistics fun.<br /><br />If you're comfortable with math, you might cut to the chase and read Chapter 8 first.  That's where Silver explains Bayesian incremental probability theory, including its simple algebraic formula.  Silver explains the theory but not the formula, which you can figure out yourself if good at math.<br /><br />That's a small defect, however.  He does explain how important the Bayesian approach is in an ever-evolving dynamic world.  And in Chapter 8 he describes its application to the most important field---economic forecasting.<br /><br />That chapter also summarizes research showing that GDP forecasts have a 6.4% error range (3.2% plus and minus). It alone is worth the price of the book.  No one, after reading it, will credit the so-called &#34;fiscal cliff,&#34; whose vivid name is based on a months-old CBO forecast of a 0.5% GDP contraction---a number far less than the forecast margin of error.<br /><br />The rest of the chapters apply the theory to subjects ranging in importance from spotting financial bubbles and pandemicsto political polling, weather, baseball and poker.  Most readers will find some themes of marginal interest, but Silver makes all easily digestible with his superb prose and constant focus on what's interesting or what matters.<br /><br />This is not a handbook on statistics, probability or anything else.  It's a book for laypeople and journalists who need to know *and understand* why forecasts are often (even usually!) wrong, why laypeople and journalists usually misinterpret and misapply them, and how we all can do better.  To the extent investors, voters and policy makers internalize its easily digestible lessons, our society and our lives will improve, and perhaps even our balance sheets.<br /><br />That's why its a must-read, probably one of the five most important works of nonfiction I've read in the last decade.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a great series! I bought this a week ago and could hardly put it down. I had to download the kindle app on my iPhone so I could read it on my down time at work. I would recommend this book to anyone who would enjoy a great suspense thriller and a puzzle. It's worth it!
B00979CS50|5.0|Thank you Neil - this is incredibly GREAT ROCK & ROLL. These guys are as old as the hills but can they jam. This is great traveling music. Put it in and hit the road. In college, in the late 60's, I had to travel thru the Salt Flats of Utah and the desert of Nevada to get home. Neil was always always with me on these long road trips. Crank up the volume and hit the gas.
B005JR47R6|5.0|All House episodes are great ... it was one of the best series on TV... too bad it had to end I enjoyed all of them.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|An amazing show....really gives a more real sense of how society will react and adapt to something so catastrophic....Not a fan of this 3 month hiatus, but I will just watch the whole series from the beginning again!!
B0090EHVMC|5.0|The Lorax from childhood was a family fave and we were worried the &#34;New&#34; version might be awful, Cat in the Hat anyone. We were elated that the Lorax was excellent in the animation, dialoug and kept true to the message! The songs are a hit in our house and car!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season is intense! It's sad to see so many of the original characters go, but I guess they have to go with what is in the comic book. I lie the show and don't know of any one tha doesn't, but I will stop watching when Darryl goes. He is awesome and makes the show exciting and more interesting.
B00633W614|4.0|I'm new to the writings of Jeffrey Archer but after reading the first in the Clifton chronicle series I definitely had to read<br />this second novel. I look forward to the third in the series (to be released March 2013).  The author definitely knows how to keep you waiting for the next in the series!  This one ended in a more abrupt manner than the first.  I would recommend this to any one who enjoys being taken back through history and family beginnings.  The author concentrates more heavily in the area of the family than history for a good blend that keeps the reader hooked.
B003L77GGK|5.0|This is my most favorite show. The Winchesters are sexy, handsome and very courageous. I am hoping that the show agree to another season and many more to come. But unfortunately all shows comes to an end.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|News feeds wont load after 10  or so . Its very frustrating. Even a few games r doing the same. Please FIX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001E75QGG|4.0|The movie is about 3 stars and I do wish it did better because the trilogy before it was pretty awesome.  The product came in good shape and without issue.
B008J9EYFG|5.0|I have pretty much everything Beth Orton has released. This is some of her best work. If you know her work you'll like it. If you don't, you should give it a listen.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I thought this was super. Really insightful and well crafted. I sent a hard copy to my Mom and although she has a Kindle Fire loves the gift of books.
B009KYXEY6|5.0|I LOVE Lana Del Rey! She is amazing and she has a unique style which is beautiful to hear. Can't wait for her next album!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was not expecting such an interesting story and the dark implications but you won't be able to stop reading once you start!  I had to read all three books and did so in three days!!!  Made my marriage just a bit hotter ;-)
B008DL466C|2.0|Compared to Rolling Papers, this album is a huge disappointment. Wiz needs to lay off the week and try writing some better songs again.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I noticed some people were upset about all the profanity in this story...well, it starts off that way, so there is your first clue! It's not that much anyways, and it's placed well. I LOVED this book! One reason is because one of my higher powers is duct tape...that, and I really like survival stories where people use their brains. Plus, it was funny, and entertaining. If you are a bit of a techno geek, and you LOVE NASA, then you might really enjoy this story.
B001OSIV62|2.0|This is a fantastic film. I'd like to watch it with my family, but there is a part where the guy is talking about how he felt like a rock star, and that he had groupies, and they show a sex scene, which is just stupid and unnecessary, and only detracts from the rest of the film, which is very classy. I'm very disappointed.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|cute game it's lots of fun. My daughter loves playing it. I just wished you could earn more gem stones.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|this is one of those book series that once you start reading you just have to finish. i enjoyed the three very much you cant read just one
B005LAIHQS|4.0|When I heard there was a 3rd Men in Black movie coming out I thought it wasn't going to be very good (the second movie just didn't win me over as much as the first).  I was surprised at how good this movie actually ended up being.  It had a lot of the charm of the first movie and was able to tie up the Men in Black trilogy nicely.  Also, Josh Brolin was amazing as a younger Tommy Lee Jones.  Definitely worth watching this movie even if the 2nd one didn't impress you.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|once i started reading the series i of course had to finish it. this book did not dissapoint. i would definatly recomend this book as well as the other two
B004AFFZNI|5.0|This is the best way to turn a GoPro into a regular camera for live performances and long term time lapse. Short of drilling holes into the case the camera came with.
B0086700CM|5.0|the longer you last on one run the faster you start to go! it can start to feel a little intense and i like it!
B007TK77QE|1.0|Never read any Harry Potter books but thought this would have to be great because she's such a great author.  Found it boring and cumbersome - gave up half way through - then read a review saying anyone who wasn't moved by the last chapter had to feelings so I read that and it seems perhaps I am one of those that has no feeling - totally disappointed and won't be reading any more of her books
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Its funny to see the politicians view of what went on behind the scenes, then to get those who actually participate with a missions view. Politicians suck, they are corrupt and never have the military members best wishes in mind - for them its a political move.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|First book of Kate Morton's I have read and found it hard to put down in places. Will be looking at her other books now hoping they are as good
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this game is free on the kindel but cost a dollar on the ipod so that's a better deal pluses the game works extremely well.
B008S4FZHI|5.0|I've read every Scarpetta book in order - starting getting sick of her whinging but still can't put them down - this book was more in the old Scarpetta ways
B00821OX98|5.0|I really enjoyed Season 1 of Falling Skies! I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of characters and story. Although the story line isn't new (nothing is these days), it's done in a very real and dramatic way. I was also very happy with the CGI/Monster makeup. It's not your typical slime and teeth, or little grey men. Great show, watching Season 2 now!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|it is really cool there are so many dragons. and there cute. I think DragonVale is awesome and needs a 5 star rating
B004LROUNG|5.0|John Grisham is one of the great story tellers of our day, and this book was just as great as his other novels.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the only show in America that makes me desperate to know what happens next. The characters are very believable and as the viewer, you really feel for them!
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|This is a great game to challenge your mind and stamina.  I do wish there was an option to not have a timer.  That would open up the game for more buyers, I think.  I let a friend of mine play and she loved it until she kept running out of time.  Then you have start the level completely over.  I couldn't convince her to buy the game after that.  So sorry, that the clock can't be an option choice.  I get frustrated myself but am determined to get through it eventually.  Wish me luck, I will probably need it.  Thanks for the challenge...
B000EHSVS2|5.0|Iv'e seen this movie many times and have enjoyed it every time, never get tired of it. I purchased this one for my Grandson who was reading the book called Patton for a book report at school. He said he had a hard time understanding some of the events in the book, so I wanted him to see the movie to help him with his book report.
B009LRE040|4.0|Best ending ever<br />They could have done a lot of cheesy things with this, but I loved the ending.  congrats.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|I had seen this movie as a pre teen with my mom and her friend then one day a year ago someone told me the meaning and point.  Peter leaving Rome encountered Jesus after his death and asks &#34;where are you going&#34;  and told Peter if he left Jesus would have to go back and die again. Peter goes back but refuses hanging upside up, goes head down.  Great reminder of doing Gods will his way.
B00846REIS|5.0|I read 50 shades of grey and saw on amazon that this book is similar to it. In many ways it is, however this is a better book in my perspective. It has more depth and plot. It isn't just about sex, it's about relationships and friendships. I cannot wait to read the second book.
B005HSL626|5.0|awesome game! I love this game but there are too many bombs, they make the game end too quick and the home screen is a little un clear and confusing.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|This is one I watched with the girls, lots of female banter going on<br />Through this movie.<br />A good girlie flick.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|the app is really good but E-bay is a real pain in the ass, everyone wants something for nothing, most of the time your dealing with  someone who is just low balling you!
B003UESJ9M|5.0|This is the second time I've purchased this movie, as<br />I've worn out the first one, so I think that speaks for itself.<br />It is a beautiful passionate movie.<br />M
B004XZR63M|5.0|Good book, very inspirational, a little bit of a tough read but it is awesome! I would recommend it to anyone!
1455519006|3.0|The producers of this audio book deserve credit for going the extra mile. I listen to a LOT of audio books, and I've never heard one with so much effort put in. At first, the sound effects (gun fire, generally speaking) and dramatic music that would kick in during moments of suspense seemed extremely cheesy, causing me to quietly chuckle. But, man, they really grew on me, and I came to find that they actually did a great job of elevating the tension. The story itself is engaging, and follows a slick, fast paced thriller formula that let the work day fly right by for me. I only rate this story three stars, however, for the following reasons:<br /><br />SPOILERS FROM HERE ON. DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU WISH TO AVOID SPOILERS.<br /><br />The main thing that holds this story back from being great is how absurdly implausible it can be at times. The plot by which Robie is ensnared by Talim (my apologies for any spelling errors, as I listened to the book) is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever witnessed, in any medium. It actually reminds me of the PS1 game, \\"Metal Gear Solid\\", where the plot technically makes sense once described in detail at the end, but it's so dependent upon stroke after stroke of luck, coincidence, and meticulous planning (on really short notice, mind you), that it just comes off like a plan hatched within the mind of a high school student for a writing assignment (David, did you play a lot of MGS when you were growing up?). Whenever there's a sticking point, Baldacci just throws money at the problem... \\"Oh, they must have bought him off... oh, they bought off a whole bunch of dudes in the FBI.\\" And the local police. And the CIA. AND THE SECRET SERVICE! And so on... Baldacci just keeps throwing money at his plot holes, and expects it to go down super smooth for his readers.<br /><br />I really liked the character, Julie, but her behavior was so absurd at times, it sort of ruined the suspension of disbelief. At one point, this 14 year old girl completely disables a trained hitman (mind you, she has no training whatsoever), WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT HIM! Yes, this 14 year old girl takes down a trained killer without so much as bothering to turn around and face him. Moments later, she witnesses DOZENS of people get murdered in a bus explosion right in front of her (a bus she was just in, mind you), and doesn't even blink. Oh yeah, let's not forget that earlier in the night, she also watched her parents get murdered. This girl is colder than the most vicious of serial killers, with nerves steelier than Alex Cross... apparently. This would be implausible enough... but then she cries at the notion of CLIMBING A ROPE a few minutes later, because it's TOO DAUNTING! ?????<br /><br />It also seems like the editor fell asleep at times, as he/she let some lines that seem like they belong in \\"The Expendables\\" slip through. I'm talking about gems like, \\"He was already dead... and dead men could not die twice!\\" and \\"If somebody starts shooting, shoot back... and shoot straight!\\"<br /><br />Finally, there is a deus ex machina at the end of the book that is damn near unforgivable. This is our friend \\"Abdullah\\", the loyal bodyguard who somehow turns on his paymaster, Talim, and saves Robie. First of all, there was no mention whatsover of this character until the final few pages of the book. Additionally, his motives are in direct contradiction to Baldecci's firmly established pattern of Talim buying everybody and just throwing all kinds of money at his problems to make them go away. He can buy off the CIA, the Secret Service, and the FBI, but he can't pay HIS OWN BODYGUARDS enough to ensure their loyalty???? Obviously, those would be the highest paid people in his employ, since they were directly responsible for his safety, and the fact that he knew so many powerful enemies wanted him dead (including Saudi royalty, who he knows have as much money as him).<br /><br />Nonetheless, this story remained engaging and interestingthroughout, even as it descended into implausibility and juvenile tendencies at times. I liked it, and the climax at the White House was truly riveting... I couldn't wait to see how it would turn out. I will definitely pick up another audio book by Baldacci, despite the absurdities that he loves to include. In a way, I guess it's kind of charming, like a movie that's been made for the USA network or something... would Lorenzo Llamas or Bruce Campbell play Robie?throughout, even as it descended into implausibility and juvenile tendencies at times.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I disliked the ending. Other than that the book was good. Just what you expect to get from Suzanne Collins
B00A6I87UQ|3.0|I've owned the print copy of Pocket Sky Atlas for a few years and it's an indispensable astronomy tool. I'm a bit disappointed with this digital version. There's no zoom or enlargement function when using it on my Droid Razr Maxx phone. Using it with the Kindle reader on my Galaxy 10.1 tablet, the zoom function works, but the resolution becomes grainy. Still though, handy to have a copy of this on my tablet but useless on my smartphone.
0547884591|4.0|Im a big Tim Ferris fan! I was excited to get this book but it wasn't my fave of his 4 hour collection.  But I think it is impossible to not learn or have your interest peaked by something in this book.  I liked the learning chapters, it was pretty cool to see how you can learn faster and more by using different techniques and I was excited for the food chapters and he did include every scientific detail about food and preparing it (which will satisfy science geeks out there) but some of the recipes I shudder to think of eating them (tongue? heart?) but there are some tidbits of info that I know I will put in effect. The hunting thing I skipped-but then again thats not my thing thats the great thing of how the book is laid out-you can skip to chapters of interest.  I think it was an interesting collection of stories, experiments and recipes and survival techniques.  Like I said there is something for everyone. And some revisited information from 4HB. And the recipes keep with the Slow Carb Diet theme. I love how his personality comes through with his writing.  Pretty good boook!
0316069434|5.0|The book opens when a woman is found shot to death in an alley during the Rodney King riots. She is a photo journalist from Holland.  Bosch is called out on the case, but only because of all the riots and each precinct is helping out their fellow officers.  He does not have more than a couple of hours to look at this case and he knows there will be no solving it anytime soon. The reason being, all cops are being stretched thin because there is so much violence happening across the city during this time. Because it's not in his jurisdiction he has to hand the case over.  It haunts him for 20 years and when he goes into the Open/Unsolved Department, he begins working on this case, which was dubbed \\"snow-white\\" because she was a white woman found in a black neighborhood during the riots when the city went crazy.  The book deals with him following his leads, and some about his relationship with his daughter and his girlfriend. It's amazing how he tracks down the evidence and finally finds the killer after 20 years.  It's a really good book.  You don't want to put it down because you want to find out what happens next.  I highly recommend it.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Worth every star. Probably my most moving read of the year. Harold Frye grew on me until I became Harold Frye and spiritually joined the pilgrimage. It is a story of coming to grips with growing old, reaching back and unearthing things buried through purpose or neglect and coming to terms with them. A great read.
B007SGM084|5.0|Very adult! I really enjoyed these books and liked having them on my Kindle.  I would definitely recommend if you are interested in learning more about different sexual perspectives.  I can't wait for the movies!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I've often thought that a mediocre writer could tell a great story well; it takes  a superior writer to make a story out of poor soil. This is a great story and the writer has crafted extra dimensions out of a great tale with imagination and style.  From this reader's perspective the book does not resolve well all of the themes of the story, but I enjoyed the story the author decided to tell. I'm not sure I want to see the movie. I think it would be impossible to do the book justice.
B0015AARJI|1.0|I thought it was the original but it is not. I spent money for nothing. We can not play with this controller
B0076DELIG|4.0|Okay, it's formulaic; it's Harry Bosch, whom we know so well from years of living with him. But it's Michael Connelly doing his thing very well. In a lesser writer's hand, it would get old. Connelly has a way of writing a straight-forward novel that attracts subplots like dust gravitates to static electricity, and a simple story becomes real life stuff. It isn't great literature, like Wolf Hall, which I read in the same time-frame, but it's a great read, nevertheless.
B00A0NOF7G|1.0|While the storyline was kind of cute..it was too predictable, too fast and not very developed. I had such a hard time getting past the grammar inconsistencies, misspellings and the use of words in the wrong tense that I could barely even finish it.
1476719071|5.0|I'm going to be honest here and say this book started out slow for me. Acutally I started reading the sample on and walked away from it. When I came back to it about a week later I sat down and read the whole thing and I was HOOKED. There is so much drama in this book I wanted to throw my iPad across the room, thank god I didn't because I would never have finished the book. It was so so so good. Travis Maddox is just*sigh* amazing, infuriating and HOT. I will be reading this one again that is for sure and I can't wait for the next one!
B00772M1F6|5.0|A great synthesis of the blues and rockabilly, this artist seems like a gift from a lost musical era, descended from a tradition of Carl Perkins and Howlin Wolf.  let's hope that he is allowed to grow and pursue his creative instincts.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|I love this CD!  Gregory's sound is true, authentic, and unmatched by any other contemporary artist of his kind!  His voice is sooo mature and stands heads above his fellow craftsmen.  Certainly a CD worthy of sharing with others and a perfect gift idea
B0052UYJDC|5.0|This book has made me want to get on board with the minimalist movement.  I am grateful to Francine Jay for spelling out the valid reasons for joining this growing population of people who live consciously and in ways that save the earth as well as their sanity.  I have already unloaded goms of clutter and feel lighter and more free !
B004GJDQT8|3.0|just can not get used to using this app as it does not provide all the details like the website.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|All time best movie for the Holidays - You will laugh, cry and everything in between with this movie. Makes a wonderful gift for the next generation to watch and enjoy
B0001ARCFA|5.0|1) When you first open these cans play pink noise through them for 2-6hours to burn in the drivers nicely.<br />2) Remove the ear cushions and speaker foam pads (its every easy).  Rub the speaker cover/pad with your hands. Work them in till they feel much softer.<br />3)Replace pads back in the headphones.<br /><br />This allows the trebled to pass through the foam much clearer and speeds up general burn in for these cans.<br />The sound is very muddy when you get them, but after proper burn in they sound very, very, very smooth!!!!<br /><br />So, heres the Good: Great natural sounding, very clean and seriously smooth sonic characteristics. Comfort is what you would expect from a remake of the most popular studio cans. Very, very comfortable!!.<br /><br />Bad: Cable feels a little cheap, but it is replaceable. Requires more than average burn in. Requires a headphone AMP for proper volumes.<br /><br />Ugly: Nothing ugly for these cans!!!<br /><br />Probably the BEST headphones for Sub $100. Tested against Shure SRH 440, BoseAE2 (comfort test only lol), Audio Technica M30's.
B009KHBDUU|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. It was the first Blu Ray movie I bought. The quality was as good as a theater.
044654759X|5.0|I am a big fan of Nicholas Sparks, I try to buy all his books. This one was at such a great price and I received it so fast, and in like new condition!! It was a wonderful book, will order from this seller again!
0793518326|5.0|The best buy for Beatles fans. This is what I am looking for many years. Doesn´t matter small letters - doesn´t matter additional expenses for glasses.
B00006SFLV|5.0|This is the very first thing I ever ordered off Amazon!! I always loved My-So-Called-Life on TV in the late 1990's so I ordered these CDs as soon as I saw them...I received them very quickly, great service and at a great price!!! Will order again from this seller.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|It is very fun to learn the songs and play them but most times I have problems<br />making the volume on my kindle fire work with the application. Very frustrating!!!
B009VA1FN6|4.0|I story set in the war years and in today with the story unfolding between then and now.  Keeps the interest right to the end when the final strands of the story come together.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's a great game. Great for the kindle.<br />Get it and have hours of fun. It will be great for all ages.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I love Susan Boyle's choice of songs on this cd.  She has such a beautiful voice.  I recommend this cd everyone.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This was a very good movie, the whole family enjoyed it.  i recommend it for anybody to watch. Thank you
B000IAZPKM|5.0|Kamelot is one of my favorite bands ever, so getting this DVD was a no brainer. The concert is amazing with Roy leading the band and the way that its shot is amazing. A def for fans anywhere!
B007ZH9P0C|4.0|Six of the eight remixes on this EP are great.  Each is unique and different.  They are definitely for someone looking for serious club versions.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It's. a really good game for on the weekend if it's not a good day outside just sit down and play the game. It also passes time really well like if you are on a plane it will pass time sometimes it freezes but it really wont only sometimes.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie.  The depth of the graphics were superb.  It left you with food for thought and hoping that a sequel will be made.  Was it part of the Alien Franchise ?  Yes, but it stands on it's own.  It was not necessary to have had seen the Alien movies to enjoy Prometheus
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I have read several books about Lincoln and the Civil War, but this one gave me new insights and was so well written that I could not put it down.  The details about Lincoln's life and his rivals for the Presidency were incredible.  How Lincoln managed the country, his cabinet and the Generals who seemed to know less about war than he did is just remarkable.  I highly recommend this book to everyone who has a passion for our great country and for this great President.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I usually do not expect much from a 3rd installment of a francise movie but Men in Black 3 proved to be a good story.  It succeeded in answering many questions one might have had from the other 2 movies.  If this was intended to have been a trilogy, it was a nice, complete ending.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I kept thinking, whatever next?; It was a totally comic and light-hearted trip through world politics, all the while claiming to be completely ´uninterested in politics´.  If only there was really such an ingenuous character involved in policy making.  It was a change to laugh through stories of corruption so strange as maybe to be true?
B009HV2JT8|1.0|This movie was actually somewhat boring.  I lost inteest about half way through it.  I would not recommend it .
B00AA0TJO8|1.0|Looks great - but cannot play it due to the fact it flips upside down no matter how I hold my Kindle Fire HD 8.9?<br /><br />Tried all the troubleshooting methods to no avail.<br /><br />Please advise and/or provide a bug fix for the Fire HD 8.9 version soon!
B0090EJR1K|4.0|This movie my husband LOVED he thought it was super funny and worth it to watch. It was also a very dumb movie....But one of those that are so Dumb that its just funny!!!! It kinda like You don't Mess with the Zohan with a twist.
B007SGM084|5.0|These three books cover such transformation for the characters, and the ending was the best of all.  It was just a Fantastic read.
0064400557|5.0|This is a great classic that is challenging enough for my Niece that she will be able to learn from this book and still get more out of it later on. Shes a reader and has never heard of this book...what is the schools doing to these kids...but then again it is 2 grade level above her.
B002ZG99IG|5.0|I love the movie and I was happy at how fast it arrived in the mail!! Speedy service and I appreciated it a lot
0142410314|5.0|This is a great classic that is challenging enough for my Niece that she will be able to learn from this book and still get more out of it later on. Shes a reader and has never heard of this book she thought it was just a movie (lol)...what is the schools doing to these kids...but then again it is 2 grade level above her.
B001QD5OSS|5.0|I loved the movie, the service was speedy, which I liked, and I'm a happy person! This movie has become my favorite movie of all time and I have amazon to thank for that!!
B0091REZMW|2.0|This game after I bought it had potential. because it was a hunt and find game. It did change up a little bit. However the items you were supposed to find were all ways the same and then when you ran out of gold coins or diamonds you had to buy them to go further in the game. the other thing is that every single day I had to download a update for the graphics and then after the update....Nothing happened.
1451696191|5.0|at first, reading this book, one doesn't realize the purpose of it but as you continue reading, the book shows its true character. As a outcast, Charlie looks for whomever will fulfill his needs as a kid. It shows how we end up hanging out with the friends that we have- some out of desperation and some due to social circles. It's a great book and I would recommend it to anyone.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I find Pinterest easy to navigate, and a fun way to 'catalog' different categories of things that I love, want, and must have!
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Great Closet Conservative movie!!!  This  just goes to show that some people in hollywood are conservative, maybe not the actors  but the rest of the people who made this  movie not all but the main driving force behind it ,
B009B8YZKS|5.0|Exceptional audio and video quality. A well acted compelling story with brilliant production value. A must have for any true fan.
0321784421|3.0|I got this book to help with an online core I was taking for the intro to HTML 5.<br />To my surprise, the writing style made it easy to understand. Normally with a &#34;how to book&#34;<br />there isn't anything to look forward to other than reading instructions....blah.<br />The authors were able to make the material palatable and easier to digest.<br />I did learn that the internet and web browsers are still not ready to fully support HTML 5.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I like Harry Bosch and I love Michael Connelly's books.  Why can't I get them from the library?  I have to buy every one!  I know this is the new problem for publishers, but you should not advertise that I can get free bestsellers.  I do not like Vampire books, nor &#34;Fifty Shades of Grey&#34;
B006CHML4I|5.0|Me llego la entrega rapido antes que todo lo demas que pedi, excelente servicio, y llego en buenas condiciones que es lo importante
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Excellent book.shows what brain power can accomplish. I would like to see more books by this author in the future.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|This is by far the best album KISS has recorded since Revenge although Sonic Boom was a fine precursor. This album rocks from the opening screaming chords to the absolute end. Die-hard or new fan, if you like good old fashioned kick ass rock and roll do yourself a favor a get this album today.....you will not be disappointed! Additionally, the album is recorded on analog equipment giving it a much more raw sound and it works well. A truly great album.
B008AX1HD8|2.0|After enjoying reading many Harry Hole adventures, I found this particular one hard to finish, dull and without focus.  Jo Nesbo's other Harry Hole mysteries that I have read are sharply focused on the why and wherefore of a particular crime.  This novel is hijacked by the author's interest in Australian aboriginal culture and the immigrant experience of other Australians.  I could not connect the aboriginal dreamtime stories told here with the crime that had been committed.  I thought that the author was trying to make a connection, as was Harry Hole, but I felt the strategy failed.  Also characters were introduced who had no connection with other characters or the story.  I thought it may have been more about Jo Nesbo's experiences in Sydney, Australia than a traditional 'who done it'.  Perhaps it should have been written as a travelogue.
B008GOAFBQ|4.0|Nice to hear a great album re-mastered with today's technology. Re-tooling gives this album an even wider scope to appreciate and includes a nice bonus track........Sweet Pain with Ace's original solo. Average fans won't find much use for this but the big KISS fan will appreciate this effort.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This game is fun and addictive.  I like too that has three different options of how to play. The Zen mode in particular makes me  feel like I am not really bad at video type games. It lets me play for awhile anyway.
1451620829|4.0|I'm a big KISS fan and always thought Gene and Paul were wrong in what they said regarding Ace and Peter but this book explains A LOT! Peter was out of control most of the time and pulled some stunts that would have had him out of my band way before he left KISS.  To his credit, Peter comes clean and gives us an honest assessment of what went on and takes his share of the blame.  This book leaves you a bit annoyed at what he did but rooting for him today as he is still battling some demons.<br />Definitely worth the prices.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|This movie was more than I expected.I felt the actors performed their parts well, the story was excellent, the screen play was realistic and the ending was far better than expected.
B00684J49U|5.0|I did not get hooked watching this series for several years.  Even though I can often catch reruns, it is fun to have the set to watch whenever I want.  While I don't see much authentic about a hospital, it is fun to watch.  There is no hospital surgical room that would have all of the doctors operating on one patient at a time.  And, there is no hospital that would have all the doctors standing out in the emergency entrance waiting for patients routinely.  But, it is still an entertaining series.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|It's a lesson about learning in addition to cooking.  The information is advanced enough for all skill levels of culinary adventurers.  Quite possibly the best of Tim's books but definitely the one nearest and dearest to my heart and my personal fav!
B0079XPUOW|4.0|The story took a more philosophical turn than I expected after reading the first 4 chapters for free, which only increased my need to finish the whole thing. The coda gave a greater sense of closure for me. Thank you Mr. Scalzi.<br />\\"To be, or not to be... fictional.\\" I think best describes this book.
B002CMLIJ6|4.0|Liked it. :)  like the quality of DVD & the contents inside of it . . . . . . .
B000FC1HBY|3.0|His approach becomes less and less unique as the series goes on.  It is somewhat entertaining. However the series is growing tiresome.
B005M2OIB8|3.0|It's okay because there is no special features in this Blu ray version. So might be I'll buy another one.
B008XG1X18|5.0|great app!! no bugs that I have came across yet! very User friendly and easy to navigate around!  works well on the kindle.
6304711905|5.0|This is a great action movie that we all love but not very close to the truth of what will happen but a great movie!! Get Keven Costner movie if you want close to the!!
B000T433CO|5.0|This is a Holiday tradition for our family. We love this movie and watch every year. A great holiday treat.
B001N44BVQ|5.0|This is a very well made movie and is very close to the truth as well!! I think this is the best movie Leonardo DiCaprio has ever made and well wort buying!!
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I loved it and am really glad to add it my collection.<br />I ordered another copy and will give it to my<br />Great grandaughter in college.
B000FA5TTW|4.0|I think the author did a great job of narrating this story from the viewpoint of the murdered person.  She's got perspective and some emotional distance from what happened to her.  Very interesting and a little eerie.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I downloaded this the day after abdominal surgery. I had intended it for my daughter but it has really given me something to do during my lengthy recovery. I do wish the gems were available besdies paying for them.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I pre-ordered this from Amazon. When I got it I went home after work and put the DVD in the Blu-ray player. I was blown away from the opening licks. It's like they never quit, much less 32 years ago. There are no words to express the feeling of watching the members of the group, plus Jason Bonham drumming, slipping right into place in the music.<br />Jimmy Page has some new toys for his guitars, as does John Paul Jones' keyboards. Jason wails away on a new set of Ludwig Vistalites and in several songs, especially at the end or &#34;Rock and Roll&#34;, I see him channeling his father. He admits as much in the liner notes. It's something to see. The only thing Jason does differently than his ol' Daddy is use a double bass pedal on the songs requiring the bass drum triplets that John did with ONE PEDAL (!!). I drum and it took me a long time to find out that he did triplets on the single Ludwig Speed King pedal. Amazing. I love my old Speed King, but I ain't THAT fast!<br />John Paul is as rock steady and fluid as he ever was and his keyboard work hasn't lost any of it's original luster. I always admired his bass runs on &#34;What Is and What Should Never Be&#34; and &#34;Ramble On&#34;. He and Bonham completed each other and it's the same on this show.<br />Robert's voice took a bit to get warmed up. But when he did, I wasn't disappointed. I know some of the songs had the key changed, but it didn't mess anything up.<br />The rehearsal dvd wasn't as thrilling  as the show. Practice is just that: practice. This was recorded 4 days before the show, so it was as smooth as the show, with the exception of one song Jason muffed, but on the next effort was nailed down tight.  The only thing I didn't like about the dvd was the fixed camera position. Nothing was clearly visible. But, that's ok; it was practice.<br />If you don't have this set, I don't know why or you've been on a deserted island. Get  it. If you're unhappy with it, mail it to me. I'm sure I'll end up wearing my copy out!copy out!
B000XXGMSS|5.0|I love this boots but I had to change the size ,, I don't get why some shoes have a different sizes
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I read book one on a whim, and really enjoyed his style.  I love long historical novels and family impacts.  Book two was just as good and I can hardly wait for book three.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The plot was very complex and kept me guessing to the very end.  The overall planning and executionof the scheme by the main character and his compatriots was a pleasure to behold.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|confusing at the beginning, but was OK at the conclusion.  Would have liked more info up front, different from his others.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|this game is awesome!! Two thumbs way up! I thought that this game might be boring but when I started, I couldn't stop! this game kept me coming back for more! Can't wait to download the second one!
B009FZFONO|5.0|A show about a zombie apocalypse may not be for everyone, but this show is brilliant! What becomes of the moral code we all live by after the fabric of society is destroyed? The Walking Dead answers this question with a well written, suspenseful, complex, and action-packed story.
B0037SQ3C6|5.0|You should buy it !!! Li Yundi is one of the best Chinese pianist in the world. especially his performance for Chopin's piano.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|During our recent trip to Italy I used tripadvisor to review every hotel the agent recommended and to contact the managers. During the trip we used it to find restaurants near our hotel.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I got this for my Kindle FIre HD.  The default location is Los Angeles.  I type in my current location but there is no way to add it to the app. If anyone has this app and can enlighten me I would appreciate it.  Otherwise I am going to delete this from my Kindle.
B0045D3N3O|5.0|one of Denzel Washigton best portrait  as the charismatic Malcom X.If you like movies based on true story ,you wont be disappointed.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Got it as a gift for my sister-in-law.I know she wqill love it,too. Susan has a beautiful , calming voice.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|One of PS VITA ,s best JRPG. A real must have.<br />Buy it now if you have a PS VITA.
B008XBCJ34|2.0|there wasn't much about the movie that looked 3D. I expected to be blown away and was very disappointed. Thor was superb.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a wonderful conclusion to the hunger games! It is a must read...you won't want it to end. I am already going to reread it!
B003UYUQZW|5.0|I watched this movie a few times because I really enjoyed it. Good performances by all the actors involved especially Gemma Artertan! Wow, what a beautiful woman! This movie is classical Disney fictional magic. If you like that sort of thing? You will enjoy this one. I highly recommend this one for  the whole family to enjoy! H.J. Barrera
B008602KQI|5.0|I watched this movie and it made me interested in reading the books. You will love this movie if you are into action or love or both! My husband and I saw it in theatres and were on the edge of our seats the entire time. WONDERFUL.
B0086DBE62|5.0|The old story of Snow White is retold in a refreshing way with Mirror Mirror.<br /><br />Rarely have I seen costumes and sets play such pivotal parts.<br /><br />This fun filled romance has a first rate beast at the end.<br /><br />The thrilling plot developments and wonderful acting keeps the show engaging.<br /><br />I greatly appreciate the clever way the background of the tale is introduced.<br /><br />The end has all those boring credits along with a beautiful music video kind of clip.<br /><br />Yes Julia Roberts does a great job here but she is not alone in making this magical show.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie for the following.<br />Family night<br />Romantics<br />Children<br />Girlie girls<br />Insomniacs<br />Baby sitters
1452110581|5.0|i had no idea how well cats could write. i had the whole family reading it and laughing out loud. thank you.
145162607X|4.0|This is my first foray into the Cousins' series and it was gripping!  I checked the \\"real\\" history on Wikipedia to help line up all the players.  Even knowing the denouement, I couldn't put it down.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a fantastic show!  I really did not think that I would like Downton Abbey but it just sucks you in!  I can't wait to watch the third season!  All you have to do is watch the first one or two episodes and you will be hooked!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Like all of Albom's work, this is about the archetypes we carry with us, gifted to us by a collective unconscious. Albom seems particularly able to tap into those archetypes and mirror them back to us, to make them conscious so that we can examine them. Those who read his books expecting full blown character development are missing the point. We fill in the archetypes with our own experience. We put flesh on their bones and hold them to us as friends we know at deep unconscious levels.<br /><br />Mitch has done a wonderful job of tapping into the collective unconscious again, this time about time. Thanks so much, Mitch, for another great adventure in helping me to flesh out my own Father Time.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|The mic works well, but there's a noticeable hiss on the recorded audio that is a little distracting. Overall, it's a decent quality mic at a really affordable price.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl will surprise you page after page! The insanity of the characters will make you want to NOT do something you need to do just so you return to the book!
0800132343|5.0|My husband had requested it so I bought it for him as a Christmas present. He still watches it very often
B009VB97EY|3.0|Entertaining but nothing more than that. It is a good rental if you want to watch good looking men dance.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|My hubby had been asking for this for quite some time but it was always out of stock.  Finally it was available and I bought it for him.  Our family of 3 can easily play a game or 2 while dinner cooks and we all have fun with it.  I even just bought the expansion set for a stocking stuffer!
B000JQU1VS|5.0|The Entertainment value is great. The stories are timeless with very realistic yet fantastic content. It holds its own even in today's highly saturated entertainment market. Love to spend time and read these short stories.  As they say it all in the details and the characters deliver every bit in these stories without much investment in your time as a reader.
B007XH6BPG|5.0|I have listened to this album ten times now and I must say I enjoy every song on it. This awesome CD album is only 47 min. long, like old vinyl LP's.  No padding or filling in the time length on this one! But it has nine dissimilar songs that really make there mark. The album took Squire and Hackett,off and on,five yrs to realize.They took their time and with Roger King's (keyboards, and Producer) helmsmanship they put out a very sophisticated album. The songs have elements of Led Zeppelin's Kashmir...The Byrds...Beatles..Beach Boys..early Genesis..Asia..and a touch of YES of course! Vocal harmonies and catchy tunes are prevelant. Chris Squire's song \\"Aliens\\" is often dissed as the weakest song,but I find it to be very foreboding, eerie sounding. There are songs on the album that are very radio friendly too, and those would do very well (I'm sure) if given more radio exposure, such as: \\"Sea Of Smiles\\" or \\"Perfect Love Song\\". Since it is only 47 min. long there are solo parts within it, where I wished they would carry it on longer, some songs end too quickly. I'm left wanting more! Perhaps this is a tease for future collabarations? A trippy peculiar neat album I love it, and be forewarned some of the tunes will get stuck in your head \\"earworms\\" that's a good sign!
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|This game is a throw back to the old school RPG. While at time easy and simple the bosses can be diffucult.The job system is enjoyable and love how you apply merit points to develop your characters the way you want to.Great job and at 99 cents it was a steal.
080701429X|5.0|The book arrived in a timely manner. The book looked new and contained no stain, highligting, or writing, but it was bent down the middle there were no marks but it was bent.<br />maybe it was the mail carrier or the shipper not sure but it's condition was good.<br />Satisfied costumer :)
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This movie is amazing. There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest films of all time (if only the Academy could see that). This is a great conclusion to this legendary film series.
B009SCR7RU|5.0|I love all the Tinkerbell movies but this was by far my favorite! I think they did an extrodinairy job on the animation and the different seasons. Especially winter! All new characters and I think I am in love with all of them! Definitely a must see for all Tinkerbell fans out there!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|too nasty for my tastes. This book left me with un healthy images in my head that I now can't erase.
B005K01VZS|4.0|Once more Mitch Album has managed to tell a thought provoking narrative about life and death and whatever comes next in his one of a kind voice that keeps us coming back. This book brings light to the issues of religious coexistence, life-changing faith, and an undying dedication to a cause greater than one's self. I couldn't put it down and I daresay anyone interested in afterlife and faith will experience the same. Very well done.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I mainly use this clock for work but its the best alarm clock ive ever found. it lets me customize the behavior of the alarm and even works with the kindle screen off. my last alarm ddnt ring unless the screen was on. but this alarm is great
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I replaced many years of Day Timers use with this.  So easy to use. All my notes are in the cloud and accessible on all my devices.  How perfect is that?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Plot was great in this final book, it gave a good wrap to the rest of the series. Highly reccomend.
B003O86FMW|5.0|First off, I would HIGHLY suggest reading this book. Once i finished the first book i couldn't wait to read this one and this one was even better than the first one. I highly suggest reading this trilogy.
B002C949AE|5.0|I saw the movie Desert Flower and needed to read the true unbiased story. My heart was grieved by the sheer brutality of the act. Women all over the world should find a way to become an active voice in bringing this mutilation to an end in our lifetime. I will find a way to help!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is so cool I could play games with the ponies defeat the evil ponie and its just to fun when I look at my reminder and it says play with ponies I just jump right out of bed and ask for the kindle.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome book. Did not see the movie yet, but reading the book will make me understand it more. You should read the book
B000002LR3|4.0|The song LOADED is the reason I bought this CD. It has some quirks/tweeks, what ever you want to call them that are,.....let me say this. &#34;A Little Ahead of their Times!&#34; It is all unexpected, but very well recieved. I can see why they were not main-stream, almost just a bit to _electiq(&#60;Spell check), but I liked it! All I can say is this. Buy it! I bought it used, it is one you should have in your collection. GREG
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Love her cd... definitely worth buying!  This cd has an array of songs.  Great background music, study music, driving music, etc.  Love her!
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I do not know what was going on with this app, but everytime I set it to wake me up, it would not. I know that I checked it at least 2 or 3 times to see if it work, but it never went off to wake me up. It even has a little icon to let you know how mny items or minutes it is until the alarm goes off, but for some reason I was still SLEEP!!!
140053271X|5.0|I'm giving 5 stars for best value for money, excellent design and quality of display. Touch screen and micro sd card support adds real value to user. I am able to store over 2000 books and still have plenty of room for more. Also PDF format support is perfect. All of that without commercials and for same price as Amazon Kindle classic. :)
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I actually like the game and it played well for a few weeks. I was able to play enough and unlock people and all of a sudden the game reset itself in the middle of me playing. I admit that it did have major gliched while playing and especially if you didnt have an internet connection. It didnt bother me becaue it was free, but that made me think the game is unbeatable because you do have to play alot to unlock certain people.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The past is obdurate. I almost wish this would have been written under a pseudonym, as I think many anti-King readers will miss out on a truly fascinating novel. I'll admit, I wasn't gung-ho about reading it myself--not because I have anything against Stephen King; he's fantastic--but more because I thought it'd be full of too much sci-fi/fantasy related storylines. I saw the term \\"time travel\\" and lost any desire to read it - at least right now. Boy am I glad I changed my mind. After reading 100 or so pages of another book, I tossed it aside and pulled up 11/22/63 on my Kindle. After 3 days of reading in every spare moment I was able, I was rewarded by finishing what I can only describe as \\"The best novel I've ever read.\\"<br /><br />Now, I don't use that phrase lightly. I've read quite a few in my day. But the combination of the historical accuracy provided by the JFK storyline and the unusual, but highly enjoyable, love story between a man of 2011 and a woman of 1958 was admittedly intoxicating. It made it impossible to put down unless true responsibility was knocking.<br /><br />My best advice for one wrestling with the decision to purchase this book would be this: simply, do it. Do not let the time travel or history theme sway your decision. At the core is an addicting story that leaves you begging for more, while being thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion. I can't imagine that anyone would dislike it for any theme-related reason, as it is not dependent on its general theme. As one reviewer wrote, the time traveling is merely a launching pad for a truly genius work of art.<br /><br />So what are you still doing reading this review? Go buy it!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This is a great case for my Kindle Fire! It does everything you want a case to do, hard shell protects the unit from getting broken or scratched, the unit snaps into the case and fits perfectly, the cover is soft on inside where it touches the screen and folds to form an easel to use in the landscape position. There is an elastic band that holds the cover closed. My only complaint is that I would have loved to have more choices on colors or pattern.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|I love love love Florence and the Machine, they have a package that creates different stories in your head. This album was definitely a surprise, a good one. Even when the title seems bizarre one listen to the song and you're instantly hooked, must must MUST buy!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|great game. very cute And entertaining I love it. great download. only minor lag at sometimes but still very worth it
B005RAO0GS|5.0|There are literally no words to describe how amazing Florence and the Machine are. Their songs are impeccable and go deep into the soul. A combination of her voice, the lyrics, and the music all create this fantasy world. I don't want to say I have a favorite just because every song on here is AMAZING, but only if for one night is definitely one of the best. RECOMMEND RECOMMEND RECOMMEND
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book was an unexpected favorite!! It absolutely tore my heart out and I couldn't put it down!  I have recommended it to lots of book buddies!
B005QPGHQU|4.0|I'm glad Evanescence has come back into the music industry, missed them there for a while. Although this album is full of good songs I wouldn't say it's their best. But as a fan it was a must to buy, take a good listen to their previews and if you are open minded you'll come to love the album and later on the band even more
B00846TTDG|3.0|A solid movie that makes one feel like an American, a rare ideal these days.  The story is well drawn and relatively easy to follow.  The acting is a bit choppy but this is to be expected.  I will watch this again.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|Love it. Love it. Love it. Can't think of even one negative thing to say about the game except I'm not getting my work done since my Dice With Buddies addiction.
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|Purchased for my Synology 1512+ NAS...Works great...Took 2 minutes to install and DSM required nothing special...It's a memory chip...ether it works or it doesn't...I paid $12....
B007HACDLK|4.0|Mr. Flynn took his hero to a new level of being human, yet still as focused and committed to keeping his country safe from all threats however it needs to get accomplished.  His ability to weave in the thoughts, motivations and actions of his compatriots and enemies made this the most exciting and insightful of the Mitch Rapp series.  I couldn't put it down!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I really enjoyed the first two books of this series, but so far I have not gotten into this third book.  It's not horrible, but....well it's not horrible.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|John Corey is back.One of the best John Corey books yet. I cant wait for the next story to come out.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|works great on kindle fire.  fun game challenging levels.  great graphics.  I highly recommend this game.  it is addictive &amp; a great way to pass the time.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|excellent book two. It follows all of the characters for the previous story very well.I'm looking forward to book three
B005721W9O|5.0|After many urgings by friends and watching interviews with Tim Allen & Alan Rickman, I finally saw this movie. It's so smart and funny while never taking itself too seriously. Tony Shaloub is astounding funny.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This reboot of the classic series was done incredible well both with the story and the cast that were chosen to play their individual roles,yes the original cast were great too but you can't turn back time and make them thirty years old again(Or sadly to bring some back to life) it's time for a new generation to star in the limelight.  At first I to was skeptical but after watching this cast of talented actors and actress perform their character roles so well my mind was soon at ease.It was great to see the early years of Spock,Kirk,McCoy,Uhura,Scotty,Sulu,Checkov start of the beginning years in Starfleet before they would become hero's.  The video is sharp and detailed very clear and the audio is superb especially in the action scenes the soundtrack was also done very beautifully.  So if you already have the other Star Trek movies or series then this is a must have to add to that collection as well...
0061733199|5.0|This is another must have in case of emergency.The book covers a wide range of things that just may save your life!
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|Great game.  Modern day Pictionary! This game is keeping the kids very busy. Recommend the booster pack when more than a couple of kids are playing.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I got tired of issues with my amd x6 chips so I thought I would switch to Intel. I compared this to the i7 which are really only offering hyperthreading as an extra, for another hundred dollars and decided that the saving on this and the motherboard (use a h77 chipset as the z77 features are really exclusively for the i7 chips) made this a good buy and I was not disappointed.<br /><br />It runs everything fast and cool. The chip features are idea for modern ssd drives and built in graphics (which I don't use) would be fine for almost all users who don't play hi-res games. Without replacing my still excellent gpu I got serious framerate  improvements (about 30% according to FRAPS).<br /><br />The stock cooler is fine, even under load but I prefer a liquid cooler and the temps run at around 30C to 40C with stock and about 5C less with the liquid cooler.<br /><br />The lower power requirements mean that the entire system is cooler and the intel advanced features are surprisingly useful, especially the fast internet connect which is linked to the h77 chipset.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I play the game with my. daycare kids. they love it even the 2yr olds can tap the coins and apples.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Fairly entertaining but the plot was a bit thin and there was not as much action as in his better novels.  I hope his next Mitch Rapp  episode is better.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love it<br />Absolutely great read. Enough to keep you interested. Not too fast or too slow action.recommend it to all ages
B004XDYJRU|3.0|I had the free version of Tune in Radio while I had my old Android phone, and I liked it enough. My older sister had the pro version, and what really gravitated me towards the pro was the fac that you could record songs, stations, etc.<br /><br />What I don't love about the pro version:<br />-The ads in my scroll bar. I was confused when I got the first notification, but then it became overboard. There were certain things that it would inform me about that I had no care to listen to either on the radio or at all. There really is no mark for preferences when they just spit everything out.<br />-It cannot locate all the stations! So many of my local stations are unavailable according to TuneInRadio, which is so annoying because they are the ones I desire to listen to. And it's not like I have bad signaling or live in a small town area - I live in the Bay Area - but that doesn't play any factor anyway, because the only station I listen to in New York is impossible to listen for it is \\"unavailable.\\" I finally had to download iHeartRadio to play my local and etc stations, but that is so besides the point when I have this app, especially when I paid for it. Ugh
B009MF56GC|1.0|I bought this item and waited a week to get it and all that was in the package was a blank disk. It said I had to download off the internet and when I tried, it said my computer was incompatable due to copyright laws. what a piece of crap. why didnt they just give me the movie I paid for????
B007EECSFA|5.0|I love all of her books. Very entertaining read, well written and interesting history in the background.Always enjoy her twist at the end.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|love, love, love!! beauty and the beast classic movie one of the best of all time ... love love love
B009YU62H2|5.0|This album ROCKS!  I think it's one of there best, CRANK it up!!!Been in my player for over a week.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Amazing!!!!!! This book is so great I've already read it twice. The main character Jake is the so great at narrating a detailed version of history!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app but Pc is bated than this. app but this app needs updates bad this app needs lave water minecarts and redstone and villages bad!?#
B003AYPMCO|5.0|No words for it, the case, the cd's, the dvd, everything is ok, so, may be it is not a &#34;must have&#34; but if you are a Priest lover this is a great collector's item, go for it!
B0030IG0C6|5.0|Seems very well made and sturdy enough for my little kids: almost 5 and 2 years old.<br />Good size and very neat paint.
1934030597|5.0|This book has tons of information with great illustrations and explanations. A must for anyone who likes working on their own bikes.
1936608618|5.0|I have been an endurance athlete for over 8 years, about 4 years in I found CFE and Brian Mackenzie and I have never looked back. The book is the summation of what they have been talking about over the past 5 years, and is t he core of my training and philosophies when I train personally, and how I coach others, and have gotten great results and used CFE methods all the way up the the full IronMan level.
B005TBWN0K|2.0|Very hard to draw with, app wouldn't always recognize my finger. If you get it, make sure you have a stylus to use because it comes out unrecognizable.
0316069434|2.0|It's hard to expand on the other long time Connelly/\\"Bosch\\" fan reviews who think this offering is pretty weak. As a retired cop I've always enjoyed this franchise, since there was always a hint of credibility in the plot line. Not this time, the plot is ridiculous and the resolution obvious from early on in the book. Another reviewer suggested it's time for Harry to retire, and if this is the quality we can expect from this point on I heartily agree.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is my go-to calculator! Easy to use and read! Not your basic calculator! I highly recommend you add this to your applications!
B000HKW7E0|2.0|I watched this with my family because it had such good ratings here. I remember the \\"Vacation\\" movies going downhill fast after the first. I thought maybe this was an exception that I missed. But I found it slow and predictable with few good laughs. My kids thought it was OK, but I did not like it much.
B000209ZAE|4.0|I haven't used it a great deal yet but  it seems like it will be a handy tool.<br />The cam action was not well finished. It needed some filing and sanding to work properly.
B008JJM88Q|3.0|This app gets five stars...if it is working.  After two weeks the app kept insisting that I update a nonexistent update and always gave be a network error message.  After deleting and reinstalling the app I am still getting an error which prevents me from playing.  Not favorable until it is fixed.
B007HACDLK|5.0|My husband got this and loves all of Flynn's stuff.  Very satisfied customer. Go ahead and download this, buy it, or any other book written by Vince Flynn, you won't be sorry!  His first movie will be out soooonnn!!!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Highly recommended.  Gorgeous visuals on display.  Very nice game. Looks and plays smooth. Remember to password protect shop for kids.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Excellent movie...lots of fun...all the characters from the movie brought together to save the world....battle scene is awesome...blah, blah...blah....dude seriously....
B000FVE3BG|5.0|i´ve been after this watch since several months and i finally got it, this is my second Invicta Force. i already have the 3332 and they both are beautyfull and elegant and they both get good compliments, the watch arrived in time, well packaged.
B006RXSGLE|2.0|nothing worth reporting it really wasn't that good....could have had a little more opportunity for some sense of realism...but I read thats what many peeps like the stupidity of it....
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I play this game every day, I like to collect the prizes, the puzzle pieces and see how many coins I can get with each turn. It helps to pass the time.
0446530573|5.0|Recommended to me by a friend.  It is even better than I thought it would be.  If you love Italian food, you will love this book.
1401235417|5.0|Scott Snyder has solidified himself as a a legendary Batman writer.  The Court of Owls has all the elements of Batman. Action, detective narratives, and brooding, but Snyder takes it further to enrich the Batman story.  He examines Batman's role in Gotham and brings about a frightening new foe that Batman is not prepared for in the least. If you enjoy this tale, check out Snyder's previous 'Bat-tale' The Black Mirror.  And worry not! It is very accessible for new fans, and first time comic readers. Snyder does Batman's lengthy history justice, without relying on it for new story development. A great Batman story.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I thought the book was great! I think Vince stepped up his game from his last book. I was glad we came back to the present time.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|The movie frustrates with characters that are not real, seeming our of place on a scientific expedition. I watched the movie 2x, getting more out of it.
B002GYI96U|5.0|Like all of the Kinsella/ Wickham books, this book is light, funny, and entertaining.  Not ground breaking, somehwhat predictaable, but definitely moves quickly and is worth your time.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|Led Zeppelin Celebration Day in my opinion is by far their best album to date especially the fact that it is recorded live.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is one of Grisham's best.  Everything moved at such a fast pace and with all of the details floating around, it was very hard to put it down.  I finished the book in three days.  I loved it.  This will make a great Grisham movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a wonderful bible application! It's user friendly and even has an audio feature. I'm well pleased with this purchase.
B009DTI2U4|1.0|Just not a very good mix. As live discs go<br /> its pretty bad and I own every note mike oldfield has played. Not a good purchase
B002LFPAUC|5.0|This is a timeless clasic and I would recommend this series to all my friends. The quality of the remastered collection is perfect,unlike Manual's Pigeon English which is hilarious.Basil Fawlty is perfectly played by John Cleese.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|If your here you wanna to check out comments to see if they screwed up the third installment. Or you don't have a clue was up. Either way stop reading my junk I'm typing to get in 10 times the unnecessary wordage to make em happy about reviews. In 2 words-<br />WATCH IT!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|WAKING UP MARRIED  unis a fun book with good dialogue, but, is, of course, predictable. We all love when the hero is gorgeous and obscenely rich and falls for the beautiful girl-next-door type. I did enjoy how they met and, surprisingly, Mrs. Kelly makes the wedding seem believable.
0345803507|2.0|I am still wondering why I bothered to waste my time with these books.  The books were written badly and if it hadn't been for the hype probably would have been a dud.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|wonderful songs, everything I expected...LOVE IT! Great songs, great artists, well done and I play it constantly!  It's a must buy
B009FZFONO|5.0|A friend told me about this series and I wasn't sure how they could make zombies into a series, but it's great!!! I am completely addicted!!!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I can listen to her voice for hours on end...will need to look at getting other cd's of hers!<br />LOVE IT!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This Kindle application works perfectly in my android phone, and is easy to download. The images are crystal clear.  The interactive features for a reader are marvelous.<br /><br />George A. Ellis, Author: A Symphony of Silence:  An Enlightened Vision<br /><br />[[ASIN:1477459286 A Symphony of Silence: An Enlightened Vision]]
B006LSZECO|3.0|Very slow beginning, skipped sentences; plodded on until I was hooked and then enjoyed the book a lot. Twisted, complicated plot was very intriguing.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Wow, they didn't even try to hide the fact that they used a photocopy machine to steal the Plot from Alien.  This Lame excuse for taking your money follows the plot for Alien almost at about 75%.  Fancy spaceship and a crew...check.  Android that gets his head ripped off...check.  Alien parasite that implants itself in the female Heroine...check.  Alien sends tube down throat of victims...check. Female heroine only survivor..check.
0316228532|1.0|Its Just Not the same, JK Rowlings attempt to write an adult novel falls short and probably would not be recognized if she had not been the author of Harry Potter series.<br /><br />Pros<br />+Name On Title<br /><br />Cons<br />- All pages In between.
B009LRE040|2.0|2 Hours and 45 minutes and it could be argued that Batman only shows up  in the last few minutes.  The rest of this snorefest is occupied by Bruce Wayne, who apparently is a cripple.  Having spent the last EIGHT YEARS moping and feeling sorry for himself suddenly decides that being a cripple will not stop him from stopping Bane.  Bane stomps him into the dirt and throws him in a \\"Hole\\" which a lot of other people are consigned to as a prison.  Bane spends the next three month destroying Gotham and Murdering anyone he pleases.<br /><br />Somehow in this cesspool Bruce Wayne does a few pushups and gets his health back...escapes and then the fight begins in the last part of this movie.<br /><br />Give me a freakin' break.
0545091020|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to the book on CDs in my car.  It was a great set.  After the book, I went to the theater to see it.
B008G59IKO|3.0|I feel like this album wasn't the best that Green Day could do. The lyrics were okay and the overall flow of the album was decent. I really like Ashley and Lazy Bones, along with Baby Eyes and Makeout Party. Lady Cobra reminded me of the White Stripes, which was pretty cool. However, Nightlife was abysmal, I couldn't bring myself to like it. This album overall sounded well, but I feel like it was overproduced. So instead of a real raw sound that was promised, it sounded &#34;fake&#34; raw. So yea 3/5.
B00178JDCK|1.0|This is a beautiful, well constructed unit and it worked great for about 5 times and no more than 45 minutes each time. The unit went out, I changed battry's several times and it made no difference. I contacted Behringer and although it was new, bought from an online dealer, they refused to repair it. I also bought the BEhringer Digital Multi-FX  FX100 pedal. It went out exactly like the DR100 and same reply, no help. On the other hand I recieved a First Act reverb pedal for a gift. I used it constantly for over 6 Mo before it quit. I contacted First Act, they replaced it and apologized for the inconvenience. I would n't recommend any Behringer products to any one under any condition. YOu would thing they would attempt to take care of their customers, especially in this economy.<br />I am 66 years old and have been playing off & on since 1964.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The acting, dress, and setting in Downton Abbey is second-to-none! By far my favorite show, please keep up the good work!!
B008FQ1O7O|5.0|The photographer had an amazing idea when he decided to photograph our little angels in such situation.<br /><br />I love dogs and loved the book. Congrats...Everybody who loves dogs should have a copy of it. I bought the digital book but do intend to buy the real book.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Love her Burlesque CD with Cher.  We loved her powerhouse voice.  This is more club sound where the beat is more important than showcasing her voice.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I love this app it is fun and easy to use I wish there were more song selections but that is life over all I can not put down this app and I totally recommend it.
B0031RS2XG|5.0|&#34;Made to Stick&#34; is a book any aspiring copywriter should read. It's about finding and focusing on the higher motivation.<br /><br />This is one of the top 10 most valuable business books I own. Read it.
B0067AC5KA|4.0|It took a bit to get into the book.  The Swedish names slowed things down and all the people were hard to keep straight at first, but once into it you are hooked.  Couldn't put it down.
0446577391|5.0|What can I say? I like all of Baldacci's books. The 'Stone' series are great thrillers packed with plenty of action.
B002ZG99CC|4.0|I could not find this movie in the stores near me and wanted to get it for my grandsons.  Got it in a reasonable time and was glad.  Really good movie
B004MYF4SS|5.0|I first thought of this book as a &#34;crime novel&#34; but realized it really was about the development of the main characters and their back stories that kept me riveted to this book. Additionally, the author's description of the island and it's topography added to my interest . I look forward to reading the other books in this trilogy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Well there were a lot of emotion running in my head when I read this last book great book and a good read can't wait for the movies now
B0094BB4TW|5.0|So happy there was an app for my Kindle fire. Face-book is face book. You either love it or hate it. Great to be able to WIFI when I am on the go.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|Upon listening to the lyrics, Fun. numerous times references loving family, thinking of family, leaving family.  It's sentimental, sort of.<br /><br />While I really enjoy the music, I can't help but think one of the more catchy tracks, &#34;One Foot,&#34; portrays an anti-Christian message, claiming we can save ourselves, we do not need the love of God.  While I realize this doesn't bother everyone, I found myself singing along, then suddenly wondering &#34;WHAT are they saying?!&#34; and upon closer examination, it simply reaffirms my suspicion.  Which is unfortunate.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|The best of the best a must read if you are just starting to read Super Natural. Then you can move on and understand where it all began.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|This is a cheap cash-in on the star wars IP with a deceptive pricing model. Stay far, far away from this game.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Use it for work and home. Great way to easily access anything I need. Easy setup. Wish it worked better with a Swype keyboard.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|I typically despise all Christmas movies because I'm not much of a Christmas person.  This is one of my all time favorite movies.  It shows the absurdities of the things we do each season with the hope that there will be happiness among the family.  Great performance from the whole cast.
B008S847X2|1.0|Cannot comment as does not &#34;read disk&#34; on my Bose system.This is  disappointing as I cannot hear my favorite guitarist
B000P0J0A6|4.0|If you have never seen Gremlins I urge you to find a copy - even buy it - and watch.  It's lighthearted and a great movie made before CGI.
B008I43DYU|4.0|I added this calculator to my kindle to give me the capebility of this app for my use while in the shop or at the test bench.  I will do mostly just basic math functions, but it is capable of more than just adding, subtracting, multiplying or dividing.  It is a full function calculator with many of the scientific capabilities as well. A nice addition to the kindle, which brings me to the fact, as to why it wasn't included in the basic formula of the programming package.  4 stars.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|It doesn't matter if you like football, this is a film about compassion and overcoming odds.  It's a truly amazing and inspiring movie.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|Can we get a meow? It appears not. The Dark Knight Rises is just not an entertaining film. It has a few moments of interest but otherwise demonstrates how a film maker believes that the bloviating dialogue of secondary characters can carry a movie. I've already taken the chore on, but if one wants to sit back and watch nearly the entire Batman cast fill in non action actions scenes talking repeatedly about \\"the bomb\\" and what it can do, and how it will hurt people, have at it. Would you watch this film again and again? Obviously many will (and have), but I have to wonder if it is just false praise because of the affinity we have for the Batman character. This is a boring movie, period. Sure there are action scenes but they are not well presented, and I could care less about them without a cohesive and thrill inducing story.<br /><br />Catwomen who's name we are to secretly know through pure inference was sexy looking but dull. Her mask was bogus and added nothing to the character. Again with sequence after sequence of cut/chop fight shots that I've seen adinfinitum (even much better) in low budget martial arts films. This was a disappointing Catwomen who I'm sure advocates of the film will say was unique and introspective. Uh, no, I was just waiting for her to \\"come alive\\". I like live action comic book characters, not costume rote lined bores.<br /><br /> When it comes to Bane, he definitely projected awesome terror but his words dragged on. In addition, many liberties can be taken with comic book characters but Batman recovered way too fast from his injuries, especially a near broken spine.<br />I think this film like the second Nolan Batman film  relied heavily on empty chitter -chatter. Words that ended up meaning nothing and scenes that labored on to no exciting purpose. It's great to see one of my favorite DC superheroes taking it to the criminals with a cool costume and bat-weaponry, it's a shame you must endure an act of drudgery to get to the few decent scenes of a big screen Batman. The Dark Knight Rises is a failure. The ending , which we all know is just that, a true no more ending, leaves you with  the only bright spot, the development of Robin, which looks like it would have played out better than what I just sat through.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I Couldn't put this one down!! I Can't wait for the 3rd book! Suspense and passion so perfectly put together!
B00129H7VS|5.0|This is exactly what my husband wanted for Christmas and I am so excited to see him open it. Thank you!
B009MO5G90|5.0|People who don't like movies like this; especially in 3D and on a nice TV, would probably be better off watching something like \\"Lincoln (2012)\\".  Personally, I can never pass up any of the Resident Evil or Underworld movies.  Expendables 2 was also non-stop action.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I was so excited to get these dvds at such a great price!  I can't wait to have a Harry Potter marathon day.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Phenomenal read. John does it again. It needs to be a movie now. Great characters and more twists than a pretzel.
B0053O89IS|5.0|Received DVD in a timely manner.  Enjoyed watching this season I thank the people at Amazon for helping me find what I need and for having the DVDs on hand.

B009YP9L7U|4.0|This story was really cute. I enjoyed the characters and found them to be remarkably reasonable for a romance novel. I enjoyed that it had a certain amount of heat without being overly reliant on it to develop the story along. How often do people think that maybe it would be better to marry for compatibliity instead of love? This book explores what happens when you follow that line of thinking. I liked that they both weren't so broken that they couldn't be fixed.
B004HX4RT6|4.0|Picked up the game mostly for my son and I to play chess while waiting at a chess tournament. Works pretty well. I would prefer that it didn't flip the board each time, so it could be laid out like a real chess board.

I have had this game for months.  if you got stuck on a puzzle you could just go on to the next one. on the last update the dev made it so you could not progress without finishing the prior puzzle.

B004LWZWGA|1.0|This COULD have been a great movie / DVD; however I think the director really didn't care about it.  It sure shows!<br /><br />I normally only comment on the technical and presentation aspects of DVD's.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" has a horrible soundtrack (2.0, 5.1 - I listened to both).  I could not understand most of the dialogue and NOTHING of whatever the character Bane was saying.  My experience was that of listening to a movie with mostly incomprehensible speech and gibberish.<br /><br />The picture is spectacular but I prefer to understand what is said when the characters talk, not guess.  Christopher Nolan should have made this a silent movie; then at least I could use my imagination, fill in the words myself, and I would not be distracted by dialogue I cannot understand.  I should mention that this is almost a flawless DVD with one, maybe two pauses during play.<br /><br />What will amaze you is the one extra feature on this DVD:  \\"The Journey of Bruce Wayne\\".  I played that and it was thoroughly refreshing to hear people actually speaking clearly!  Hah!  Why could such clarity not be achieved for the feature film?<br /><br />2-stars for high-quality DVD [play] and picture.  Sorry, sound is important to me.  I couldn't understand what people were saying sometimes even when I was looking at their lips.  Very weird sound mixing and shortfalls for such a big-budget motion picture.  Bad experience.<br /><br />ADDENDUM 2013-02-18:<br /><br />This is the crappiest modern DVD I've ever heard, sound-wise.  I first watched this DVD December 07, 2012 and I had no further interest whatsoever in it ~ but decided to give it another try February 18, 2013.  I have listened to both Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Surround 2.0 tracks, with the latter surprisingly being a little better.<br /><br />The director and writer introduce this very powerful and threatening criminal character, and you cannot understand a word that he is saying!  Of course, most of the other dialogue comes across as gibberish, too.<br /><br />It boggles my mind that in 2012 a movie would be made with such poor sound.  Save your money, and save 3 hours of your life -- buy some older DVD's and cheaper ones that have superior sound -- most will, trust me.<br /><br />It's not even entertainment.  I would say classify this DVD as \\"frustration\\".  Very, very poor product.  This Batman series would be dead anyway based on this DVD.  It's just... junk.  What a waste of time for the actors to be immortalized in trash.<br /><br />I am also going to reduce this to one star.  I hope to never sit through these 3-hours of garbage again.  And since the main characters wear masks, good luck reading lips!  The dialogue was probably dubbed in later... via a soup can!

0312427646|3.0|Now, folks, I'm no prude!  I've run high schools and colleges so NOTHING phases me.<br />I was pre-reading this novella thinking it'd be an interesting gift for my cousin.....until &#34;eventually Sir Kevin got a call from the special advisor,&#34; who apparently didn't like the Queen recommending books to his prime minister.  Explaining there are some things he does like........and here he refers to oral sex.......totally out of context AND he doesn't use clinical words to point that out; he describes exactly what he likes.<br /><br />Purpose in the book?<br />Shock value?<br />Characterize the special advisor?<br />Stress differences in the social classes?<br />I have no idea - but I do know I'm not ordering new copies to gift to my cousin, my Anglophile friend, or anyone else I know.

B00846TTDG|5.0|How can you not love a movie about real bad ass warriors that give their lives for this country?

B0085W6II8|4.0|This is a really solid album if you're a fan of either Steve or Chris.  I generally find that when a &#34;star guest&#34; is touted on some songs on Steve's albums, they turn out fairly poor or boring.  Squackett, though, stands on its own.  Quality throughout, I thought.
B008AX18Y6|3.0|I would recommend this book to others who, like me, love Rushdie's work.  It is fascinating to read about how he wrote his famous and well-loved novels.  I did find it filled with revengeful comments against his ex lovers and wives and also others who he feels let down by.  The attacks are in poor taste and left me feeling uncomfortable about him as an individual.
B003L77FYS|4.0|It is unique yet his input to the unit always seems logical but sometimes not so helpful.  Castle's observations as a writer at almost every crime seen has a tendency to cause Beckett to automaticaly become defensive of the units observations and input as officers against writer.  No conflict between the unit and Castle is ever displayed until Castle talks Beckett into a line of investigation that not only seems rational, but attainable, that is until Beckett and Castle windup in a situation which is so far to the extreme as to present harm or even death to both of them.

B005LAII6C|4.0|Not everything about this movie is successful but who cares when it's this entertaining. I saw this in the theater and again on Blu 3D and I have to say it only gets better with repeated viewings. I've never seen stop motion like this, it's insane. The people who made this movie are crazy, psychotic shut-ins. God bless 'em. The rigging. The sets. The hundreds of thousands of interchangeable faces they pressed, the hand crafted hair and costumes... the extras on this Bluray set will open your eyes to the art of LAIKA in a way words just can't compete with. None of the craft would matter if the story and characters weren't so endearing. This is 80s style storytelling at its best. Think Goonies. Think Monster Squad. Then add a dash of zombies. It's just the right amount of inappropriate. The end is unexpectedly poignant.

I don't think Clarke was really trying to tell a good story. He was exploring the limits of SF writing, and he did a great job. This is more like a literature than a novel.

159420411X|3.0|This book was ok. It wasn't terrible and it was on a topic that I am quite interested in. However, it just didn't seem to really do the topic justice. It was a rather mild and sporadic introduction to some of the problems and situations that are encountered when predictions are necessary.<br /><br />He specifically cautions against hubris and generally his writing reflected that, but then he also sometimes says stuff like \\"...it is hard to improve on a good method for aggregating polls, like the one I use at [the author's prediction web site].\\"<br /><br />Indeed, his real nugget of first hand wisdom seems to be that taking a poll of polls is better than direct polls. Ok, not terribly shocking. Of course it starts to sound a bit like a pyramid scheme since someone has to do some real work somewhere.<br /><br />The author is a bit religious about \\"Bayesian\\" thinking. I would not argue that Bayes Theorem is useless or even generally ineffective, but as a solution to all of life's uncertainties, I feel it comes up short. For example, in the US people like to imagine themselves as \\"innocent until proven guilty\\" yet if we assign a prior probability of zero to being guilty, then Bayes Theorem will always produce innocence. I'm not saying Bayes Theorem is correctly applied here, but I am saying that there are cases of uncertainty where a firm adherence to it will not be ideal. The author made no such allowance as far as I can tell.<br /><br />Despite having strong feelings about the futility of \\"frequentist\\" thinking, the author does not really explain exactly what it is and why it's bad. He seems to go into almost ad hominem criticism of R. A. Fisher. To me the idea of arbitrary confidence intervals is about as weird as the idea of sketchy prior probabilities.<br /><br />His notion of \\"foxes\\" and \\"hedgehogs\\" might as well be translated as \\"winners\\" and \\"losers\\" for simplicity. As he points in other parts of the book, it's easy to see who the foxes must have been *in retrospect*.<br /><br />Before reading this book, my explanation for why some predictions succeeded while most don't was one of two things: luck or cheating. Cheating covers things like insider trading or point shaving. This book did add a couple of possibilities for a mild type of cheating that I hadn't really considered so fully before. First there is the aforementioned aggregation trick. Noted. And second, fishiness.<br /><br />The author seems to have done a lot of his prediction training at the poker table. (Hmm, until it got too hard.) He talks about \\"fish\\" who are the participants in a poker game who are simply low on the skills necessary to consistently win. If you put yourself in a situation where it's your predictions against theirs, you stand a good chance.<br /><br />In addition to poker, the book wanders all over baseball stat geekery. I'm not really a baseball fan so those parts were a little noisy for me.<br /><br />The author's folksy introductions to the genuinely impressive list of people he interviewed for the book were a little contrived. Sometimes I felt like his interviews had little signal but were supposed to just impress us with the name dropping. Donald Rumsfeld was someone who kicked off a chapter on counter-terrorism that really didn't shed much light on anything in particular for me.<br /><br />With so much random baggage as contained in this book, it was inevitable to stumble across an area of personal interest. Unfortunately I was not impressed at all. The topic is earthquake prediction and the author isn't just entertaining a healthy skepticism about the ability to make predictions, rather he ridicules certain approaches, specifically animal reactions as precursor signals. I'm not saying that animals predict earthquakes, but the USGS web site specifically says \\"However, much research still needs to be done on this subject.\\" And far from there being no conceivable explanations, there definitely exist compatible hypotheses to go with the verylarge body of historical evidence, for example in the work of Thomas Gold.<br /><br />This book didn't really address the technical nuances of the mathematical tools we use to refine predictions. It didn't investigate the important philosophical implications of probability. It didn't thoroughly talk about the history or important people who have investigated the topic (especially minor but interesting people like Frank Ramsey, Bruno Di Fenetti, etc). It didn't offer any compelling insights that will make my decision making better.<br /><br />At 454 pages, that's too much noise for not enough signal.large body of historical evidence, for example in the work of Thomas Gold.<br /><br />This book didn't really address the technical nuances of the mathematical tools we use to refine predictions.

Hopefully there will be a next movie but Nolan doesn't need to do it. This was a weak story. The Dark Knight was vastly superior to this one.<br /><br />Yes, I'm assuming there will be another with Christian Bale. From Wikipedia, \\"The film received positive reviews and has grossed over $1.081 billion worldwide. The Dark Knight Rises is currently the 7th highest-grossing film of all time, the second highest-grossing film of 2012, and the second highest-grossing superhero film of all time.\\"<br /><br />There is no way Hollywood turns it's back on a billion dollar franchise.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I never thought I'd be writing a review for Taylor Swift, but here I am. I've always found Taylor Swift's song to be very refreshing in a radio dominated by dull pop records. I would have never considered myself to be a Taylor Swift fan until recently, however I have been advocating her music as some of the best for a while now. While radio listening is not something I do frequently, when I do a Taylor Swift song is always more than welcome. It wasn't until recently, however, that I decided to buy all four albums and these are my thoughts:<br /><br />After listening to all four albums chronologically it is very noticeable the change in style. She goes from a very poppy teen friendly singer with country background to more of a rock sound. I have become a big fan of 'Speak Now' and 'Red', which consequently are the only two albums that I've seen available on vinyl. Not to take away from her previous two albums but the most recent are by far the best. I am a snob when it comes to music, finding it very difficult to veer from my source of favorite bands which mainly consists of 90's British bands. I would have never imagined listening to Taylor Swift on any other occasion except for the rare time I might have the radio on. This new album opens up with the fantastic tune 'State of Grace' which hit the spot from the first play. There have been quite a few negative reviews of this album which I find to be undeserving. It seems that those more fond of her first two efforts are less enthused by the most recent two. I can do without the manufactured for radio tracks such as '22' and 'Never Ever Getting Back Together' which have been frequent victims of the skip button as I feel they are the weakest tracks of the album and quite possibly two of the worst songs she has ever made. The rest of the album more than makes up for these shortcomings. Stand out tracks are State of Grace (maybe my favorite), The Last Time (fantastic duet), The Lucky One and Begin Again. Other notable songs are Treacherous, All Too Well and Sad Beautiful Tragic. I find all the songs to be enjoyable, sans the 2 aforementioned radio demons.<br /><br />With all that said, I find Taylor's new direction extremely promising and look forward to future albums. I highly recommend this album and hope that it can attract new fans, such as myself, who were not overly excited about her early work. I also hope that fans of her older material can get on board with the new sound, as it really is quite good.<br /><br />Well done Ms. Swift.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Miss Minerva Lane lives her life quietly and recedes to the shadows, keeping the attention away from her.  When she was a child being the center of attention ended very badly for her and it has scarred her for life, physically and emotionally.  Now the Duke of Clermont catches her hiding from a would be suitor and Robert is instantly intrigued by this woman who is quiet yet leaves a mark with her clever remarks.  As Minnie starts to piece together Robert's involvement in a possible workers movement she finds new layers of him and in turn, he starts to peel back the shell that Minnie has so carefully constructed around herself.  But when Robert's brother suddenly becomes accountable for all of Robert's actions, how can Robert help him while protecting Minnie and not revealing all her secrets?<br /><br />Now, I will start off by saying I am a total Courtney Milan fangirl and I (im)patiently await each new release of hers and the wait for The Duchess War was worth it!  It is so well crafted and written in a way that you just savor each word and you are sad when it is over.  Minnie is determined to keep her scandalous past in the past and she portrays herself as a quiet, mousy type woman but Robert makes her start to hope again, to want to be her true clever, interesting self.  Robert is a refreshing duke.  He refuses to be like his father, cold and expecting everything handed to him just because he is a duke but in the process, his father pushed his mother away (since she controlled the purse strings) so Robert currently has a very strained relationship with her and all he wants is a family to love him.  In the process to prove he is nothing like his father, he tries to right all his wrongs and if that means treating the workers in the factories more fairly and letting them know through handbills, than so be it.  He expects so little for himself that he can not believe that Minnie could ever forgive him for his actions after her previous betrayal.  Together they make a complex yet beautifully simple couple that fit together perfectly.  The ending is sure to tug on your heart strings and I just loved it.  And even though I don't like a lot of history in my romance books, the workers movement information was threaded in in a way that did not overwhelm the story for me and it provided a nice backdrop.  Overall a beautiful, heart breaking romance with humor, love and forgiveness written by one of the finest historical romance authors.  Just lovely.  5 stars<br /><br />*review copy*complex yet beautifully simple couple that fit together perfectly.  The ending is sure to tug on your heart strings and I just loved it.

B007Q0OV6Q|2.0|Not sure what I expected, but I'm pretty disappointed by this set.  First off, the models are tiny, not particularly interesting, and in some cases unidentifiable (is that a ship? a gun?).  Second, the package is incredibly cheap.  The display case and doors are just cardboard flaps cut into the package box with a very flimsy plastic tray behind them.  There's no way this will last more than one season.  Finally, the cost is ridiculous for what you get, which is about 8 oz. of plastic and a little bit of cardboard.  When did Lego become such a ripoff?  I got this one on sale and it was still way overpriced.

B009A9BF5G|2.0|This blu ray was not worth the 30+ price tag.  The visuals are extremely grainy, and almost seizure-inducing, as the video switches on average every 2-3 seconds.  You never get the sense that you're there, or that you know what the concerts are like.  It's just these blurry, grainy action shots with splashes of weird neon texts at points.  Further, the audio is very poorly mixed.  You can barely hear any of the vocals on any of the songs.  The instruments come through extremely clear, but even this to me was a downside, because it didn't feel like I was watching a concert.  It sounded like it was a studio mix with some audience noise thrown in afterwards.<br /><br />The artist &#34;interviews&#34; (soliloquys) between songs also rubbed me the wrong way.  The last thing I want to hear between this poor audio and video is how much these guys made on tour and how great they have it.<br /><br />This is what happens when artists value money over quality.  They should be ashamed.

B007IXWKUK|1.0|Terrible series.  No real story line.  If I could give less than one star I would!  Don't waste your money on this series.
B0011FL7FA|5.0|Love this movie. Have seen it dozens of times it will never get old. Great soundtrack also. . . .
B009RROP12|5.0|An absolute gem of an album. If you love your rock with uplifting melodies, soaring vocals, driving guitars and more more hooks than a fisherman's tackle box, then this is definitely for you!<br />If you want a breakdown of just how good every song is then let me point you to  MelodicRock.com. This fantastic Website give this masterpiece 100%, and this 40 something rocker would certainly not disagree!
B0052HLSHA|3.0|What would you do with a pill that gave you superhuman intelligence? Bring about world peace? Solve hunger or poverty? Teach your brilliant ideas to others? No, not if you are the hero of this movie. He goes for mere selfish sex, money, and power.<br /><br />I like a profound theme in my movies. This one could have been a profound and meaningful tale about a modern Faust or Icarus. But it chose a cheaper, more shallow path.<br /><br />True, this movie was fun thrill ride. which I enjoyed more via streaming because I could fast forward the sex and violence. I just wish it had chosen a more profound theme.<br /><br />This movie is about a lazy slacker who solves all his problems by taking a dangerous drug. I would have preferred that it had been about a lazy slacker to tries to solve all his problem by taking a dangerous drug but instead learns some wisdom, even some humility.
B004JMY312|5.0|You cannot beat bette midler in most thing, but she rocks this movie. It's always been a favorite of mine and when I couldn't get it on TC amazon totally came through :)
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Four great movies, two special feature disks and the coolest blu ray case out there.  Well worth every penny.<br />  Yes alien 3 and 4 aren't as great as the first two but dont let that stop you from watching them.  They are still part of a great anthology and worth anyones time.
B003WWZ1R0|5.0|Im a yoga teacher and am always looking for new music for classes, this is a great mix. Love it.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|This movie creates a bigger world then the original Alien.  I really liked how they created this new world and new story line.  My only criticism is the unanswered questions.  There is a lot of mysteries in this movie, some are explained, others are implied, and even more are unanswered.
B00170DEM8|4.0|An old favorite, and for such a great price. Quality was good, and it was exactly what I wanted to watch. Beats netflix and blockbuster :)
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|From start to finish this movie was fun to watch.  The characters in this movie were funny and serious.  You feel for the main character and are worried about her predicament.  This movie is as good as any Pixar movie and I would highly recommend for anyone and any age group.
0143119680|5.0|I want to get the sequel to this but have to wait until I'm on vacation and can give it my truly undivided attention. It's that good.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|If you love Michael Jackson you will enjoy this concert.  Performed in England with Princess Diana in attendance. The new 25th Anniversary album has some tracks you will want to hear....never before released.  Must have if your a fan.
B000068CNX|5.0|There isn't much to say here beyond that this is a great show, its like comfort food for your tv. It was used and came in great condition, watch it all the time.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Fast paced storyline became somewhat predictive at the end.  Overall I recommend this book to all fans.  Enjoy your read.
B00007KWHG|5.0|My wife loves these old songs and I do also.  This cd has great hits.  The price is fair.  It just brings back old memories.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|loved everything about this book...<br />my favorite is the drama of these books.<br />lots of unexpected things.<br />def would read over and over.

B003RUZKC8|5.0|A bunch of rogues on a mission to get the bad guy with adventure, snappy dialogue, and colorful situations.  Creative crime fighting at its best.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I love Taylor Swift and this Album is another hit! It's a nice mix of fun upbeat humorous songs and some beautiful ballads
B00177YA1K|5.0|The best of the series.  J and K are a perfect team.  Whoever dreamed up this story is a pure genius.

B000I9UA8U|5.0|Splendid cast, the soundtrack is perfect, and it's a great story.  A fun way to spend a night when you don't want to go anywhere.
B008A1NSTG|3.0|Even though this was a &#34;soft&#34; movie, I enjoyed it because of the positive outcome and the caring for Nature's creatures large and small. A good film to watch with the family. There are indeed good deeds in this world. Wouldn't it be nice if we were aware of it more?
0385536828|1.0|I am amazed - and sort of ashamed - to say:  I, uh, well, I don't like this book!  I'm on page 181.  I'm trying, I truly am!  I shall try to finish it, as who am I to \\"not like\\" a book by Ian McEwan!  I cannot presume to pass judgement on his work.  I am apparently just not bright enough to appreciate this particular book of his.  I keep getting confused, I read in a state of faint to moderate boredom, and I couldn't care less about Serena. I must agree with someone here who said that McEwan did not succeed particularly well in attempting to \\"get inside\\" the head of a woman.  Maybe that's why I have a problem with her.  I find no suspense, I find the story plodding and banal, and I don't really care what happens.  Nevertheless, McEwan has that remarkable ability to make you remember every single detail you have read!  It must be due to what is described as his \\"crystal clear prose\\".  Hats off!  Chapeau!  I just wish I liked the book.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|I was really looking forward to viewing this film. However I was disappointed at the pace and length. The progression of the plot was very sluggish even though there were good sequences of CGI. It was, in my opinion, too long and dragged out. I'm still a fan of &#34;Batman&#34; films but this one left me out in the cold.
1933865474|5.0|Bruce Timm is a great artist and this book has best and sexiest work!<br />so if you really like this artist you NEED this book!
B001MYIXAW|2.0|I bought this blu-ray December, 2012, hoping it would be the \\"fixed\\" version, and I was disappointed to see it still has the dumbed-down subtitles, not the \\"theatrical\\" subtitles the director intended. The director has also expressed his dismay at the altered version, as it sets a different, safer tone.<br /><br />Because tone and atmosphere (created by the direction, cinematography, sound, acting, and dialogue--all unbelievably engaging) are the most critical elements of this movie, avoid this version of it. From what I've watched, the English dialogue is not \\"bad\\" but it is not nearly as brazen, stark, discomforting, idiosyncratic, and realistic as the theatrical version. You can see how those descriptors would make for a better cinematic experience.<br /><br />With the theatrical subtitles, the movie is easily five stars. I came across it one night flipping through channels and couldn't turn it off, even though I didn't feel like watching a movie. If you're a cinephile, it's a must see. If you're a Hollywood type, you'll probably find it slow and tedious.
B003VANOFY|5.0|The sound is crystal clear, and apparently the sound on the other end is likewise.  I don't see how it can be improved.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Interesting and well-written coming-of-age story about a young girl's journey through the foster care system.  Unpredictable plot and beautiful descriptive prose.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Love this game! Great find an object and figure out the clues game. There's a hint button if you need it. Lots of fun!
B0063IH60K|3.0|It's probably just me... I'm new to the whole tablet concept, so I figure with time, all things shall pass.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I had bought the arctic silver to fix the three red ring of death and i had applied this and it fixed my xbox.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I was worried that with the new moon that it would be boring, but I liked this story line as much as the first.
B004J713JW|5.0|Already owned this on DVD (which came with CDs of concert), Had to upgrade the image with the Bluray.<br />One of the best concerts ever!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend and was well worth reading. It is one of the few books that I have read recently that made me think about how I deal with priorities
B000059MEL|5.0|The Discovery record is one of the most amazing LPs that was ever written in the history of house music and this vinyl meets its needs. Its two 180g records which delivery the entire range of the songs.<br />If you like Daft Punk, House music or you just like to collect Records which are worthy in your eyes then this should be added to your collection.
B000SEIBB8|4.0|I first read this book more than 15 years ago, early in my career as a software developer. For me it is still very relevant and worth diving back into in my day to day work designing and developing software. If you are just starting out as a software developer, I would highly recommend this book.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Her new album is a really good buy!  All you Stevie fans, this is a MUST buy!  I love every one of her songs on this album.
0307596885|5.0|HOW CHILDREN SUCCEED  is an important read for anyone interested in children's chances at making it in school and later in life. It shifts the emphasis from I.Q. to \\"character\\" in children: its development and how it almost predicts how able children and later adults will be to cope with life and be, well, successful. The research on which it is based is fascinating because it includes both neuroscience, narratives, and in-school information.<br /><br />P.S. Amazon placed this under the title DEAR LIFE. Wrong book! This review is for HOW CHILDREN SUCCEED.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I am so happy I purchased this CD!  Rod Stewart's new Christmas CD really captures my mood this holiday season with his sweet, sultry voice singing all the familiar carols.  I love his light, jazzy, playful tone he sets.  A great listen for any and all your holiday activities. A MUST buy!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I started to read these book with out knowing what it was about and I got hooked instantly. Great book thanks! Hope the rumors of a movie are true :)
B005HJU7HA|4.0|The stories are innteresting. Now that I'm more mature I find that I enjoy the writing. When I tried Holmes when I was much younger, it didn't appeal to me.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I started to read this book with out knowing what it was about and I got hooked instantly. Great book thanks!
B007JMW46U|4.0|This was my first Holmes purchase. It goy me pretty well hooked on Sherlock. Different style of writing from what we asre used to in today's world.
